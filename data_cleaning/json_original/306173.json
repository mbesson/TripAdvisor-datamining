After a fair amount of research I picked the Fullerton Hotel and was so pleased with the hotels location as well as their level of service. The hotel is located directly across the road from Merlion Park (and is connected under the road by the moving air-conditioned walkway). There is also a \"hop on hop off\" bus stop directly out the front of the hotel. Also around the river at the back are all these fabulous restaurants and pubs. Really close to the MTR, only about a 5min walk, MTR will get you to Raffles for your Singapore sling too. From our room we had a spectacular view of Marina Bay Sands, nice to sit on the verandah and watch the light display. The hotel is magnificent inside and out, their service is outstanding, check in and out is a breeze, the breakfast staff are friendly and efficient. I booked directly with the hotel and received a great deal including free internet, breakfast, high tea and because it was around Easter time a nice chocolate surprise. The wifi is okay, but slow as you would expect when offered for free...the afternoon tea was exceptional, they are constantly refilling your favourite foods, if you don't stay here you should make sure you book in for the afternoon tea. The other Fullerton hotels are just across the road, the Fullerton Bay looked spectacular as well, but I can't imagine I would stay anywhere but the Fullerton Hotel when I return to Singapore. Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant is just over (or under using the walkway) the road and is rated as one of the best places to have chilli crab.

I came here for afternoon tea with a friend during the week. The service was inconsistent - our tea order was taken by an amiable staff member who coaxed us into trying something different from their extensive list of teas, assuring us when asked that we could always switch to another tea if we didn't enjoy our choices (we did enjoy them but switched back anyway for a change later on). We appreciated this tactic to encourage us to try something new. However, little details such as as my friend's cup being a little dirty when it arrived and the napkin containing the warm scones being marked on the top (looked like a buttery fingerprint) stood out. One of the sandwich varieties was made with bread which had gone hard (due to air exposure) and I had to ask for milk to accompany my tea. The jam accompanying the scones was definitely not homemade - it had an artificial flavour - surely for $42 each plus taxes homemade jam (or at least a good quality bought in jam) could be provided? On the plus side, most of the items served were good with the macarons, creme brulee, apple pastry and choux being the standouts of the sweet items and a salmon and dill filled mini cornet being a delicious savoury. Although we were two people, only one example of each sweet item was served which made it very messy and difficult to neatly halve items such as a a creme brulee, mini trifle (presented in a small glass), a custard-filled choux bun... Everything was replenishable so we didn't understand why there were not two examples of each sweet item on the tier (as there were for all the savouries). The staff seemed a little weary at times - some items were delivered to our table and plonked down unceremoniously with no grace or accompanyng smile or eye contact although at other times they did seem to make an effort to smile. This had the effect of making us feel slightly unwelcome at times! Overall, it wasn't a bad experience and most of the food served was delicious. The service however has left me with a negative impression of the afternoon tea served there and I wouldn't return. I went to the Fullerton Bay Hotel a few days previously for afternoon tea and enjoyed it immensely (see separate review).

It is smack in the middle of the financial district, and even the brand new office buildings along Marina Bay are easily within walking distance. For leisure, stroll up the quay, have a drink at one of the bars, but don't fall into the tourist traps there. Add the warm and very personal service as well as the overall feel of the hotel, and you have the ingredients for a classic hotel - for the years to come.

The pool is lovely although quite small for the size of the hotel and there is not that many day beds (maybe 15) so get in early! Overall though, I would highly recommend this hotel.

But it is pointless writing a review saying so. The point of a review of a property such as this one is not to say whether it is a good hotel but to look at whether the Fullerton, good as it may be, is value for money. Because the Fullerton experience costs a lot of cash. Forget the grand entrance and beautiful saloons. After all, you can experience any of that by walking into the hotel (there are no restrictions) and spending a while as a guest without booking a room. What you get as a guest is the use of a room and the hotel facilities so the main focus of any review has to be on that. It is there where I question whether Fullerton does offer you value for its price tag. Our room had no view. It wasn't all that big. It was quite comfortable but hardly any different from most hotel rooms in the 5 to 4.5 star category. But, again, I had an internal view of nothing. It was dark. Good room? Yes. But worth $550+? No. Facilities: I tried to use the swimming pool. It was a shocking experience. The pool is nothing grand but a narrow strip, slightly larger than a lap pool. You would get a larger pool in any 4 star Singapore hotel. The area for deck chairs was tiny and crowded. The shaded area was miniscule, and staying there at 2 pm was the equivalent of walking into an open furnace. In short, the pool would not meet 4 star standards, let alone 5. Breakfast: included in the rate, breakfast was large but the bread for stale. One morning, it could happen but not three in a row. Overall, Fullerton is a great place to stay and its location is fantastic. However, in my judgment it is not value for money. The price tag is disproportionate to the quality of the room and facilities on offer. If you go to Singapore, go and visit the hotel, admire its charm, but as for staying there at the prices on offer, it is wiser to spend less nearby and enjoy the same or better comforts. So my advice is that you should take other glowing reviews with some scepticism as to how good this hotel is.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cI Now Have a Favorite Hotel in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Alex_Tallinn", "ReviewID": "UR125484431", "Content": "I\u2019ve been to Singapore many times, staying in half a dozen hotels \u2013 from old Pan Pacific to Mandarin Oriental and the corporate tower of Swissotel \u2013 but never experienced anything similar to the charm of Fullerton.

They said they had left a letter which until we checked out could not \"find\". 3- The restaurant Town where we had breakfast forgot our request for coffee and after a twenty minute wait and not able to flag down a waiter went to sort it out myself.

I've seen people complain about the view (I didn't have much of one) but really, I did not come to Singapore to look out of my room. Go outside and look around - views everywhere. Tip: Take a cab to the hotel if your flight arrives late - I arrived at midnight so the metro wasn't running. The cab was very fast and reasonable (SGD 27). Tip: Take the metro to the airport if you have few bags. It was cheap (~SGD 2) and easy (1 block walk and 1 connection) but the mall which houses the metro entrance has a number of 1/2 steps without ramps so it was a bit annoying toting my bag on wheels over the steps.

The cocktail menu is inspiring and the food is inventive. There was a queue outside their main restaurant for Sunday brunch. The jewel in the Fullerton's crown must be Jade-its ground floor Chinese restaurant which does some of the best Chinese food I've had in eons. I say this having had excellent food in several Singapore restaurants. The only downside at the Fullerton is getting a room which looks into the atrium.

As a long time fan of Singapore and a frequent traveler to this city nation, we wanted to try Fullerton as a change this year from our long time favorite Mandarin Oriental. The minute we stepped into our room (Quay Room on the 4 th floor, #467) we noticed a bad smell due to humidity. Our hostess said this was due to the air conditioning being turned off while the room was unoccupied. We turned the air on and settled down. However, trouble continued when we decided to take a shower and a nap before dinner. Our room which we requested to be a quiet room when we booked it almost a month ago was facing the river and had a nice view but the noise from the pool area a few floors down made it impossible for us to take a nap. When we called the front desk and reminded our requests for a quiet room and their assurances, the response was annoying. The front desk insisted that tbeir manager has checked and that there was no noise in the pool area. Our troubles continued into the evening when the party in the room next to us continued past midnight and we finally had to call the front desk again, this time begging them to please do something about the noise so we could get some rest. It was around 1 am when the party finally ended and we were allowed to sleep. This is our second day and we are stuck in the club lounge writing this review instead of taking a nap in our room after spending time in the art museum and walking around town. Our room is too noisy from the pool area below and unfortunately our plans for this four day stay in Singapore this year is ruined due to Fullerton's dishonest assurances about meeting our request for a quiet room. Would we come back to Fullerton next year? The answer is, no. Are we happy about the location of the hotel? Yes, but if you are not rested what difference does it make to be at a nice location. On a more positive note, the breakfast in the club lounge was satisfactory but the lounge is small, so, be ready to get in line to wait for your turn. The afternoon tea is also satisfactory. The staff is attentive, nice and friendly. In conclusion, if you are looking for a comfortable room where you can rest after a day out in town (in Singapore, which is hot and humid all the time, returning to a cool, quiet room is ever more important than in any other city), then this is not the place for your next stop in Singapore. When we asked to change our room so that we won't have to face the pool and the river, we were told that the rooms facing the ocean are even more noisy due to the traffic.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "leffasolo", "ReviewID": "UR122028355", "Content": "The Fullerton is a great hotel.

We ate out ( we did fancy the lighthouse restaurtant in the hotel, but it was fully booked - so book ahead if you are stopping on a staurday night).

The position of the hotel is great for exploring the city, and the staff were universially helpful.

On arriving, our room was dirty. The carpet was covered in hairs and bits of paper, so we complained and we were immediately moved to another, slightly bigger room. We were sent an apology note and chocolates from the manager and also the head of housekeeping came to our new room to apologise - no hard feelings at all about the dirty room as they responded incredibly quickly, were apologetic, and dealt with the whole thing very well. The rooms themselves are very comfortable. There is everything you would expect for the price you're paying - bathrobes, slippers, extensive mini bar, toiletries etc. We then dined at the hotel. The food was a good standard, although midway through I found a sharp crab claw in my Caesar salad. It could have actually been very dangerous had I swallowed it. Again, the staff were very apologetic and gave us a significant discount on the food. The waiter could not apologise enough and I think they were very paniced about the fact that I could have quite easily choked to death, and they were going to \"launch an investigation\". The next day I was very sick with gastroenteritis and we were due out of the hotel at 12. The hotel were amazing - they called us a doctor, and let us have the room right into the evening until our flight home, complimentary. We felt that this was good customer service and left a not so bitter taste from the previous day. Our sleep quality was actually very poor as there was a marathon in Singapore starting at 5am so music started blasting from a few hundred metres away from 5am and didn't stop until midday. However, this isn't a reflection on the hotel and I'm sure they were aggravated by it too! We also visited the pool, which has a great view. When staying at the Fullerton, you have complimentary access to the facilities of Fullerton Bay (just across the road but you need to take a taxi, which the hotel will organise and pay for). At Fullerton Bay, there are 2 rooftop jacuzzis overlooking Singapore - I would highly recommend using them as they are fantastic.

The treatment I had was one I usually order at every day spa I attend and the one offered at the Fullerton was a little clinical and not terribly relaxing.

Each time I stay here I find it goes downhill, so I'm actually going to recommend our company remove it from the approved list. Yes, it has a wonderful location. Yes, it is beautiful. Yes, it is historic. Yes, it has an amazing breakfast buffet. But that it is. This place is living on its history. Once I had to wait 40 minutes to check in at midnight. Most long hauls arrive in the middle of the night, so why not be prepared? When most flights into Singapore land late at night, you'd expect to be able to get a late check-out, especially when your company puts hundreds of people there each month. They don't care. Off you go to fend for yourself (they'll hold the bags, of course) for the 7-10 hours before your flight leaves after your checkout time. And, if you have to work (as I typically do) you must check out first thing in the morning to make their cut-off time. This hotel is infected with so much that has infected Singapore recently: Mainland China fever. They know they can get the cash (and it is cash) from mainlanders, so they don't give two hoots about the rest of us. My room in mid-November was S$600/night because they were \"full.\" Why? Nothing going on! That is more than it cost during Chinese New Year! The room was a larger-than-normal room, but the view was of another building. Whoop-di-do. I found the St. Regis at $441/night (not as central) and the Raffles at $650/night (more historic). If the hotel was full, it was full of ghosts. At 7am (peak work time) there were just 4 other people eating breakfast. At 8pm the spa was empty (don't bother) as was the gym. There was nobody in the lobby or the lobby bar when I got back from the office at 7:30pm. I've never been in an emptier sold-out hotel in my life. The room service meals have gotten out-of-control expensive, even on an expense account. There are no side salads or side dishes at all. S$30 for spaghetti bolognese, S$34 for a burger, S$40 for fish & chips, and S$25 for a Caesar salad. There is no wine or hard liquor in the mini bar, but there are a couple of beer offerings. I asked about the hotel car to go to the office, since it is an S$5 ride (you take a cab all the time due to the heat & humidity), but I was told it was S$110. Seriously? For a 5-minute ride? They did that for free at the Mandarin in Singapore (which has a better spa). I would expect that rooms in a 5- or 6-star hotel would keep cool when you're out (after all, you're paying for it), but the AC goes off when you leave the room, so you return hot & sweaty to a hot & steamy room.

We booked an executive floor room which included access to the Straits Club. A very warm reception at reception (!) which is hidden at the back of the entrance. We were then taken to the Lounge for private check-in. We decided to ask for a suite and see what the price difference was. It was a reasonable jump and Joe was very happy to show us the room options. We were told we had been upgraded from our original room type. The suite had a great view across the river and the city. Our allocated room was one with what is referred to as a \"Courtyard View\" which means it looks internally, has a small window and no natural light. First impression was bad as the previous guest had also smoked in the room and it smelled terrible - why do people do this?!?! As a result we could not accept this room and as the price difference to the Palldian Suite was high we started looking at the Conrad, Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carlton. Joe came to the rescue and said that as we were inconvenienced by Qantas that they would give us the suite at our original booked price - how could we say no!! We had drinks and canapes in the Club and the staff continued to be wonderful. I have to commend them on serving French champagne (Moet) and keeping glasses topped up. The food was ok but not brilliant. Decided to enjoy the view from the room and have room service.

You get to see the huge beautiful Singapore eye rotating lit up with various colours. Also, the Merlion flowing water with its mouth open is just heavenly feeling to see with your naked eyes. The skyline of Singapore and Marina bay is just wonderful. This hotel has 400 rooms and suites which overlook the atrium courtyard or face the downtown Singapore's skyline, the Singapore river promenade or the Marina bay. Our room in fullerton was equipped with a flat screen TV and wireless internet facility. There was a mini bar and a tea / coffee maker. I used to enjoy carlsberg beer watching football match on it LCD TV. There is luxurious Asian Spa open for 24 hrs where you can get a spa treatment. The hotel cuisine is just marvellous and delicious. We enjoyed Italian cuisine at its Light house restaurant. The Town Restaurant offers a huge variety of international dishes and seafood buffet, while cocktails and martinis can be enjoyed at the Post Bar. The hotel has a huge outdoor swimming pool. As Singapore is having a moderate temperature through out the year, its nice to chill and relax yourself by swimming. I would recommend to tourists visiting Singapore to stay in this luxurious hotel to make their stay a momerable one and return to their homes with sweet memories of Singapore.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cService excellence at Fullerton Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Morwen C", "ReviewID": "UR120073062", "Content": "Celebrated my bf's birthday during this short staycation at Fullerton Hotel.

At night, the view was lovely and we had a good time chilling out at the balcony. 2nd surprise - Not only did Ms Nathalia (from guest relations) checked us in personally, after settling us, she also delivered a birthday cake to us accompanied with a hand-written card. I am impressed by the level of service and the warmth she had displayed. The suite was spick and span. Towels were clean without nasty smell. There is a full range of Nespresso coffee capsules for coffee addicts and if you aren't, fret not. a good selection of TWG tea is available for tea lovers. Those of you who appreciate firm pillows or are like me who loves soft and fluffy pillows, Fullerton hotel has a pillow menu! Yes, and I am thankful housekeeping staff remained patient and polite whilst i queried about the various pilliows before settling for neck-support and micro-gel pillows. Love love love it! I slept really well throughout my stay. It is conveniently located with quality restaurants. The Lighthouse served fine Italian food which I would love to try one day. I read it is perfect for romantic dates. :) Personally I had tried Sunday's Champagne brunch at Town restaurant. All I remembered was happy memories of lovely champagne with a wide spread of food.

I have to admit the choice at breakfast was superb. I also tested them everyday by ordering champagne (part of my Straits Club deal) and I got it...not without some delay however. We upgraded the room at check-in and I was very impressed. The largest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel room. The room was very well appointed and spacious. Staff - impressive from door to room. Room service was good. Our request to give our kids a mattress on the floor rather than a rollaway bed was dealt with quickly and without fuss. The children loved the massive koi carp pond on the basement level. Location wise the hotel is very well located for the Financial district...because it's in it. Very close to Boat and Clarke Quay. Warning: do not eat at Boat Quay...it's overpriced crap. I can get a whole meal elsewhere for what they charge for a side vegetable dish. Clarke Quay is good but touristy.

Good for our business locations, not great for us otherwise because we're not shoppers. So this time, with almost 2 days to spend in Singapore for pure pleasure (after 10 days in Malaysia), we decided to try the Fullerton. Always wanted to try it and very much wanted to be in that neighborhood. And it was great - met all of our expectations. The location is terrific - it was nice being so close to Boat Quay, even just for strolling around both sides in the late afternoon. It's close to the Padang for a little history and the Asian Civilizations Museum (a must -see) is just across the pedestrian bridge. And there's an underground walkway from the Fullerton to its sister property, the Fullerton Bay Hotel, and some new restaurants adjacent to it on the water. Although the hotel is both big and busy (and has tourists wandering around the lobby for a look-see), the staff provide very pleasant and professional service. Check-in was personable and we were taken to the room by the check-in person. We had reserved a quay-view room and that's what they delivered -- a full-on view of the Quay& river -- with floor-to-celing windows. The layout of the room is quite unique and while it's not the biggest room I've had in Asia, it was extremely attractive, light and airy, with a large bathroom accessible from 2 sides. It was quiet, very comfortable and still in very good condition (since the opening several years ago). The breakfast buffet was included in our package and it was excellent in both quantity and quality. (Thank goodness it was included, otherwise the price is very high, even for Singapore). Late on afternoon, we decided to try out the option of using the Fullerton Bay Hotel's facilities and walked over to have a drink on their roof bar. It was great -- we were asked to show our Fullerton room card (which we didn't mind at all), then shown to a front-row table and chairs with a stunning view of the harbor and new developments. It's a little pricey (especially the bar snacks) but one of the most glorious places to spend a few hours in Singapore. The service staff are excellent, there's a beautiful breeze, and just the right music in the background. It must be hopping at night! I have seen and heard that there can be long taxi queues at the Fullerton, but we did not experience that on this trip. I was particularly impressed that the person who directed us into taxi (for a visit to Changi Prison/Museum) actually remembered us when we came back about 4 hours later. It was a great experience and now we consider it the only place in Singapore we'd want to stay. P.S. One minor point. The hotel offers 2 bottled waters for free in the room (not that you can't drink the water in Singapore) plus a larger bottle of Evian for nearly U.S. $15!! And what do they leave by the bed? The Evian bottle, keeping the free water tucked away beside the ice bucket way over on the counter. If you're not very attentive, you'll be opening a ridiculously expensive bottle of water. Is the hotel staff trained to do that to \"up\" the Evian sales and make a few bucks? Hope not, but everywhere else I've been in Asia (approx 10 countries), the hotel leaves the free stuff by your bedside at night.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Must stay at in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "SNTas", "ReviewID": "UR118594181", "Content": "I am a fussy traveller when I pay good money for hood service I expect exactly that.

Hard to beat, particularly for finance or legal types. The hotel has a lot of style. It was redeveloped from the old post office, keeping the distinctive facade of this historic Singapore landmark. This turns into its main flaw, as the rooms' design has had to fit into a frame that was never made for a hotel. The rooms I stayed in were large, but oddly shaped: in one case, the main door opened directly into the bed, with the bathroom behind it and near the window; in another case, a broad but shallow room, with a wide window into the internal atrium. While this offers a change from the standard business hotel layout (deep room, outside window, bathroom and corridor first), it also takes away the sense of privacy and cosiness one expects while on the road. The lobby does a decent job at being hipper than most. Restaurants are up to standard, as is hotel service. The rather obscure gym contrasts with a nice outdoor pool.

It was the best hotel experience I've ever had. From the checking in to checking out, service was very good. The receptionist checked me in and escorted us to our room on the 2nd highest floor. Not only did she escort us, she also showed us the room and explained the use of the control (that operated the room lights and curtains). We had a Quay Room and faced the Ocean (Merlion, Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands, Arts Science Museum). It was a nice view. I hadn't experienced an in-room dining service that the fullerton offers. We ordered some Chicken Rice and Pasta for a late lunch, and Room service rolled in a table to serve us. The food was kept in a warming compartment under the table to keep it warm during the transport. The best part though, was dinner. A 4 course in-room dining service where the manager came to our room to see that everything was well. He also asked us how long we'd like to have our starters before serving the main course, etc. A very friendly and approachable fella. The food itself was also very good. The soups and salad were rich and tasty, and my steak was very tasty. Guess you'll have to try it yourself! They were very sweet about the birthday celebration, wishing my partner happy birthday. They served us a complementary birthday cake (quite a large slice, we couldn't finish it!) and wrote a little birthday card too. The room itself was luxurious, the bathroom had a large tub and a nice rain shower adjacent to it. There was also a balcony where you could go outside to enjoy the sights. We saw the night light show (marina bay sands). Never had I been able to stay a full 24 hours in a hotel room and want to stay in it longer. (well, technically, I was there for 22hrs). I would love to go there again. note: the package that I signed up for was the weekend getaway that included complimentary bathrobes, breakfast buffet, 4 course in-room dining meal and bubblebath as well as a choice of house wine or bouquet of flowers.

At night, it becomes the highlight of the Singaporean skyline, establishing a dramatic contrast to the Marina Bay Sands megaplex. In fact, the Fullerton adds a touch of class to the entire city, maintaining Singapore's charm - a distinction that few modern Asian cities can claim. The service at the Fullerton is by no means, lesser than one should expect from a 5 star hotel. The only problem with the Fullerton perhaps arises from its architectural structure. Because it was a post-office turned hotel, accomodation quality is varied. While some rooms boast a magnificent view of the quay, others, face inward into the hotel interior or worse, face office buildings across the road. This inconsistency will be main reason behind some of these conflicting reviews here. Breakfast service is fantastic. The staff go out of their way to find the seating you desire. Coffee and tea are refilled promptly without the need for gesturing. The food quality is perhaps too good; there are many wonderful local items at hand that leave you with little desire to go out and try out the local delicacies that make Singapore so wonderful. A special shout out to Lucy for her attentive service. Location wise, its hard to beat. Surrounded by the Central Business District/ Chinatown, Boat Quay leading to Clarke Quay, Victoria Hall leading to Raffles City, almost all of major Singaporean landmarks are accessible by foot. If you want to get on the MRT, Raffles Place Station is right around the corner. The Fullerton is a marvel in every sense of the word. The only downside is that rooms with amazing views are limited so one must pay a premium to experience these. I can only guess that to the frequent traveller, charm will be eventually outweighed by consistent luxury and guaranteed views. Because of this, I would definitely recommend a stay at the Fullerton, but there are better alternatives for repeat travellers such as the Mandarin Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton Millenia.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saitama, Japan", "Title": "\u201cVery good\u201d", "Author": "RoarDBL", "ReviewID": "UR117490031", "Content": "We stayed in a Key room with a view overlooking Marlion statue.

A person who meets and greets would be good. I think next time we will just go directly to it. Last time our room was located very close to the Club Lounge but this time we were on the opposite side. Which is no problem at all until there was a function held on the Saturday night and we were kept awake with tolleys containing clinking glasses, bottles, crockery etc. constanly being wheeled past our rooms. Then a party took place in the opposite room and at that point we called Reception to complain and to their credit they stoped the noise from the party fairly swiftly. Next time we will ensure we are not located on the corridor to the function room. As returning guests we were expecting a note or at check in a welcome back but that didn't happen, small detail but attention to detail counts. The hotel is in a brilliant location right next to the river and the property itself is the old Post Office Building, a lovely old colonial building. The rooms are spacious, although they are getting a little dated, but the beds are very comfortable and the bathroomis a great size with Molton Brown toiletries. Overall the cleanliness of the room was very good. The Straits Lounge is very relaxing and the staff offered a very professional service. The children were provided with small slippers and were left a personlised plate of cookies and sweets in their room which was a very nice touch. The swimming pool is in an amazing location and you can swim and look the amazing building one side a the river the other. We ate in the Ground Floor restaurant for dinner, and had the sea food buffet. The food was excellent, but unfortunately the service was very poor. There seemed to be a sortage of service staff.

The location is idea for both tourists and business customers. In our experience this is where the superlatives end. While the Fullerton Hotel markets itself as a 5-star hotel it struggles to live up to this rating (nearer 3-4 stars). Rather than maintaining the colonial feel in the interior it has been turned into a ghastly lake of marble. The service is OK in general but inconsistent. Back to the room (Post Master), my wife booked in for three weeks and they gave her a room with a view of a wall! It was an enclosed terrace (with no furniture) with a glimpse of the view through three holes in the wall (fine for those 6\u2019 6\u201d and over); a photo has been uploaded with this review. The room itself was more akin to a motel room, built-in furniture all along one wall etc. The bathroom was fine except the shower leaked like a sieve with a river of water flowing into the toilet (and signs of many botched jobs trying to fix the problem). Room cleanliness was OK but a few surfaces were dusty. The real gripe is that you would expect that they would give someone staying for three weeks a decent room, even at the corporate rate. A few of observations to note: - The Courtyard rooms are interior rooms that face into the atrium with very little sunlight, noise from the lobby below and no way of knowing what the weather is like outside - The Roof Garden area for entertaining is in fact indoors and suspended over the atrium (and noisy) - Getting a taxi to the airport on Sunday evening took a lot longer than expected (long queue and ineffective doorman) - The Lantern Bar, at the Fullerton Bay Hotel, next door was a great spot for drinks and bar snacks (or dinner) with great views of the bay and the evening light-show. Highly recommended \u2013 it can get very crowded so ensure you get the concierge at the Fullerton Hotel to book you a table - The high speed wireless internet is excellent and free (and works all around the hotel including the pool) Service on a slow night on the terrace of the Post Bar was very very slow - not just for us, but for everyone. We had to point out the waitress that there we other people waiting for service (and who arrived before us). At breakfast you get dumped at your table by the person who greets you with no explanation of the options or service. Weekend buffet breakfast is a scrum as they seem to let everyone in without thought as to their ability to feed/service the crowd. Only eat outside if you are willing to share your meal with the birds! (The only place in Singapore that seems to have this issue). The pool is pleasant but small and they have tried to squeeze far too many sunbeds into the small area \u2013 pool service is patchy (most of the time they provide a phone with a number to call). A pool-side meal that was meant to be hot was cold (including the French fries). Pool meals were not taken away and quickly attract birds that pecked at the unfinished meals, scattering food everywhere.

Furthermore, the birds also make an appearance in the swimming pool were they congregate and drink from the edge of the pool - one bird even showed up with a dead fish in its mouth. Once again, this seems to be the norm at the hotel and no preventative measures where taken, for example providing an alternative bird bath so as to discourage contact with water that humans are in contact with. From my point of view this is a serious health risk because birds carry diseases. Psittacosis can be spread through contact with bird droppings and avian flu can virus (H5N1) can spread through contact with feces and saliva. The management at the hotel just shrug their shoulders and say they cannot do anything. They were unwilling to compensate us for this experience which was a serious health risk to us and our 4 year old son aswell as an undesirable start to our holiday.

Well, the next time I shall be back in Mandarin Oriental I guess. Why? There were some details which spoiled the overall experience. The building is beautiful and in a very good location (although the former harbor has changed a lot since I visited Singapore the first time 10 years ago and the sea view disappeared as a result of the Sands hotel/casino monster). The room was clean and nice (I stayed in Heritage room) but this is what you expect in 5-star hotel anyway. The swimming pool overlooking the \"old Singapore\" and Singapore river is spectacular. We were travelling with a small kid and I obviously reserved a non-smoking room but upon our arrival (very late at night) we were assigned a room which was smoking in the past (or at least some guest was smoking in the room). They apparently tried to clean it but once somebody is smoking in a room with a carpet and fabric upholstery that room retain the typical smell for a very long time. I reported it to the front desk and they offered another room but something like this should not happen in the 5-star hotel in the first place. Also, the WC started to leak the water on the floor during our stay. Couple days after departure I received an electronic questionnaire about my stay, reported the problems and checked the box that I would like to get the response. I have never heard from the Fullerton since then. To make the long story short ... The Fullerton can be easily true 5-star property if it provides \"5-star care\" to its customers which does not seem to be the case. Also, the staff was nice and friendly ... but lacked the nobleness of people who are proud of serving their customers (compared with Mandarin Oriental).

If you like playing lottery, you'll be happy there. As this is (if I recall correctly) an old post office refurbished in a hotel, rooms can vary significantly in size and comfort. If you are lucky you get an outside view, if your not, you see the inside of the buidling (didn't call that a view because its not). If you face the inside, your room will look grey and light coming from outside will feel really dim. The furniture in the room is fine but looks a lot like Ikea to me. Not that I dont like the Nordic style but I would expect either something more elaborated than Ikea in a top rated hotel. The bed feels like climbing the Himalaya (seriously its the highest bed I've seen in the region). Its not a problem (you dont need a ladder no worries) but it feels strange as the comfort of the bed is good, but not that different from other hotels with lower beds! The swimming pool is great and the even though it is small (not a real swimming distance if I recall properly) its a very pleasant place to hang out and relax after a day of hard work!

With that in mind, there was only one place to stay on this particular visit - and we weren't let down! While the inside of the building is a lot more modern than the the wonderful facade suggests, it feels extremely classy and continues the upmarket feel you get from the outside of the building. We took a courtyard room, which overlooks the main atrium area in the centre of the hotel (it's basically a triangular shaped building, with a large covered 'courtyard' type area in the middle). The room was still bright, with plenty of natural light and - in all honesty - I'd choose a courtyard over the more expensive Marina view option. The latter overlooks a nice Marina... but it also overlooks a pretty busy road! While the room itself wasn't small, the furniture (including the massive bed!!) is pretty chunky, so there's not a lot of spare floorspace and the rooms actually don't feel especially large. Bathrooms come with the expected high quality amenities and, in our room at least, a fantastic walk in shower with a giant rainhead. Breakfast was, again, everything you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. Japanese, Chinese and Western buffets, bakery counters, fresh eff counters etc etc. Pretty much everything you could want for breakfast was available and we'd especially recommend grabbing a table at the side of the river to start your day! Service wise, the Fullerton was spot on. Extremely comptent staff, eager to serve. We had one small problem - the TV in our room didn't work when we got there, the replacement didn't work and it was only the replacement of the replacement that got it sorted, but it's hardly a big deal and was all cleaned up within the first day. In summary, the Fullerton looks special and - in my opinion at least - is special. Singapore is full of corporate hotels that all feel pretty much the same to me. For my money, the Fullerton offers that little bit more and has a lot more class.

Because we couldn't agree on the hotels, we decided to stay in three different hotels. Therefore, we stayed two nights at the Raffles, two nights at the Fullerton Hotel and one night - for shopping reasons - at the Grand Hyatt. The Fullerton is an amazing hotel from the outside. Inside it's very modern and it doesn't remind of the beautiful exterior facade. As a vintage car fanatic, I enjoyed the two beautiful vintage Rolls-Royces (Silver Shadow from the 70s and a Silver Cloud from the 60s), parked next to the entrance for transfers and city tours, even though, at least outwardly, they need a makeover. When we arrived, the Prince of the Principality of Liechtenstein (a small country next to Switzerland) stayed in the hotel and there were a lot of security staff for this reason. Nevertheless, we have booked a suite with access to the Club Lounge, we had to wait very long at the main reception until we were finally led into the lounge where we had to wait another two hours, because there the suite was obviously not cleaned yet and it seemed a little bit that no one really cared about.

What a big mistake that was!! We had booked a \u201cLoft Suite\u201d hoping to treat my wife as this was a business stop during our Christmas holidays. The Suite was a vast two storey room with two entrances on the two different levels. The walls completely covered in magnolia colour paint without anything hanging on them to give it a bit of colour! All the furniture a complete mismatch of colour, style or some furnishings to give it some warmth. The huge balcony overlooking a main road had no furniture at all not even a chair, although I could see garden furniture in front of the other rooms. First night quite loud humming noise perhaps from some generator or aircon unit. The lobby area huge and totally indifferent with some staff trying to make you sit and have a drink and then they would get the order wrong. How can you confuse an order of red wine and instead bring a glass of white!! The place promotes its self as the splendid old Post Office building in a lovely location!

Things that would have improved our stay - mainly Service: - Cleaning our room on a timely basis. We waited until 5pm for our rooms to be cleaned and were told that it was because we did not hit the \"Clean our room button\" which wasn't even working. I think a simple Do Not Disturb system would have sufficed. - Hotel lounge staff were not very friendly and were impatient when taking orders for a group of 10 (including children). Understandably we had questions about the menu as it was our 1st time in the hotel, but she seemed annoyed that she had to help us. When we questioned an order, she grew defensive insisting we had ordered it. It was simply a point of clarification, but it sure made us wonder about customer service at the Fullerton. Lounge service paled in comparison to the outstanding dinner service we received at their onsite Jade restaurant. - On Christmas day, because the restaurant that usually housed the Buffett Breakfast was full, we were moved to the ballroom in the lower level. However, we found out the next day when we were at the restaurant that the buffett selection in the restaurant had more variety and was better than what was offered to guests who were at the ballroom.

A grand gem in the fascinating city state of Singapore. Singapore as such is extremely modern and one of the richest countries per capita on earth. Yet it has chosen to retain all old street names out of respect for the British and their legacy. Another part of that legacy is the Fullerton. A quite modern hotel located in the old GPO.Modern in the sense of new furniture. Not Philippe Starck staring white walls modern. It lies by the waterside, encroached by massive skyscrapers, and with the mind bogglingly ugly giant 2356 room Marina Bay Sands Complex just across the bay. Nevertheless, when You lie by the poolside You look out over the Cavanagh bridge, still standing since 1863, the City Hall, the Opera house, the Old Parliament buildings, and, of course, Sir Stamford Raffles, standing ever vigilant as statue. The difference between the Raffles experience and the Fullerton experience lies in many things. First of all, there are no hordes of tourists loitering around in the Fullerton. Secondly the staff instantly seems to recognize You, and remember who You are. We were greeted by miss Mariko, a wonderful and quite outstanding star among the many star quality people we met at the Fullerton. We had asked for a loft suite, and had thought that these suites overlook the pool area. They do not. They overlook a major road, and the bay. So they are slightly noisy. There was also a wedding going on outside our window. So, what happens? Miss Mariko immediately sensed our concern, offered ous to change to any room category we liked that was available, and personally led us to inspect two other rooms, including a heavily discounted Governors suite! Nevertheless we stuck to our original choice, enjoying the generous space of our loft suite, with one floor consisting of a desk and writing chair, a dining area, a living room and a huge balcony, and the second storey a well appointed bedroom, a bathroom and windows going from the first up to the ceiling of the second floor. With nicely appointed plush and comfy furniture of a reasonably modern style, nice artwork, a library with books about Singapore, including the memoirs of premier Lee Kuan Yew, minibar, 2 flatscreen TVs, a BOSE stereo and sound dampening drapes. And, no less that three welcoming notes delivered that very evening. While our original room was readied, we were invited to partake of the delicacies of the Straits Club, a chambre separee where cocktails and canapes of unlimited quantity may be enjoyed between 6 and 8 PM. The canapes varied during the week. Suffice to say that the pate de foie gras was very fresh, and the russian caviar excellent, as well as the Moet and Chandon. And they make Your martini with Bombay sapphire and Noilly Prat, without me having to specify it! One may even have a glass or two of Moet for breakfast! If You have it in the lounge. The main breakfast hall is in the TOWN restaurand, and has ast varieties of food ranging from japanese to european. I have failed to find a single foul tasting food item during my entire week of stay. I actually have failed to find any fault with the Fullerton. At all. But the star of the Fullerton remains Mariko. Her dedication to her work and her genuine wish to be of utmost assistance to her guests is as remarkable as it is rare to encounter. So in summary, when we return to Singapore we will either stay in a Grand Hotel suite at Raffles, just for the experience, But we will then have to depart from a serious amount of money. As long as the Fullerton discounts their suites with 50% a loft suite is by far a better experience than an ordinary suite at Raffles. Both have their charm and both are unique. You do not get that feeling of the Old Malaya in the Fullerton that Raffles gives You, but You do get history, tradition and an amazingly good deal along with the best possible care when You go for a suite with straits club access at the Fullerton. Just one tiny criticism, though. The pool, even if it is of decent size, is not particularly deep. Rather shallow in fact. But cool and beautiful nevertheless. So we will live with that. And return.

My room (Courtyard) had all the amenities that any 5-star would give. Too bad I spent only 5 hours sleeping on the super comfy bed (back from function at 2am and had to check out by 7am). One thing I dislike about the hotel is that the building was actually hollow in the middle (like a box-shaped stadium with roof), hence when I took the lift at one end, I had to take a LONG walk to my room (approximately 2 minute from the lift). The breakfast spread was not as extensive as other 5-star hotels that I have been, but the taste and quality of the food were just yummy! Had my breakfast al fresco next to the river near Boat Quay with a fantastic morning view of Singaporean skyscrapers (now I know why the hotel is so expensive!). Overall, had a good stay.

The Hotel is in a great location for MRT which is handy to access most of the tourist attractions in Singapore. Also, close at hand are walks around the Marina and for dinner at Clarke Quay. However, if you don't feel like travelling too far, there are certainly many choices regarding eating in the hotel. Chinatown was only a short journey as well, and we loved the bargain shopping here.

The hotel is beautiful and a real icon in Singapore, so I was very excited to be staying here, even though I have eaten at several of the hotel's restaurants before. Our Quay room on the 7th floor came with a balcony that had fabulous views across the Marina, but it was surprisingly small. (This became even more apparent during our in-room meal where the waiter struggled to get the dining trolley between the bed and the tv cabinet!) Having just settled into our room we received a call asking us what time we would like to dine and what our meal choices were. This was a bit annoying as we had been asked to pre-choose these when we booked, so we were surprised they didn't seem to have the information. We went down to Post Bar in the lobby for some pre-dinner drinks. The cocktail list is very extensive and the bar tenders know what they are doing - we enjoyed some fabulous concotions! Whilst we were sipping away, the fire alarm sounded on several occasions although at no point did anyone come and speak to us about evacuating or there being a problem (friends who were also staying at the hotel kept being evacuated from their room). We went to head upstairs about 7.45 pm for our meal at 8pm, but were told the lifts could not be used because of the fire bell. We asked the kitchen to be notified and our meal delayed until we could access our room. Within 5 minutes we were were able to go back up, although no-one explained what the problem had been. Perhaps because of the fire alarm problem, our meal arrived late at 8.15 pm, and sadly came without our twice pre-ordered bottle of white wine which we had to chase up when we were on the second course. When it did arrive it was warm! And as I mentioned before, the romantic atmosphere was ruined by the fact I had to keep moving out of the way so they could serve our meal as there was so little space. At one point the waiter handed me my desert even though my main course plate was still in front of me - very disappointing service when I know the Fullerton is capable of much more. But the meal itself was delicious - very much up to the hotel's usually high gastronomic standards. The next morning we headed down for breakfast about 9am and it was like a circus. Packed to the ratfters and we had to wait 5-10 minutes for a table. Then they kept clearing away all our cutlery and glasses before we were finished, so we left without having our fill. So, whilst the Fullerton is really a very impressive hotel, I have to say I felt let down on service - especially considering its 5* status and expensive price tag.

The pool, the gym, everything is a bit smaller compared to other 5 star hotels I've been to in Singapore. I tried the Italian restaurant on top of the hotel. The steak was gooood although it is very much more expensive compared to other great hotel restaurants which serve good steak also (eg. Morton's).

If you are there on a Sunday, the brunch is absolutely not to be missed- pricey is may be at S$150 a head, but if you can stand the pain of your own gluttony, it is well worth it. Not your normal buffet, but fresh oysters on the half shell, lobster, tiger prawns; excellent sushi/sashimi; unbelievably good curries, and on and on- all washed down with lashings of Taittinger champagne or spicy bloody marys. My wife insisted on the chocolate buffet on Friday and Saturday evenings, but save your money and go to the brunch instead- all that chocolate shows up there as well. Location is good if you like shopping- 8 million malls within walking distance, though the Central Business District gets a bit quiet at night. We stayed in this hotel after several weeks of fairly intensive traveling, so were more inclined to just laze around. We picked an ideal hotel to do this- and after 5 days were sad to go. I have read some of the negative reviews of this hotel, and know that one bad experience can spoil the whole stay. We were fortunate to have not had such an experience and can say that though the rooms are very nice- and not especially fantastic, the overall experience of the service, the wonderful lobby, the breakfast and brunch was from beginning to end a real treat. We would stay at the Fullerton again.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LONDON", "Title": "\u201cI felt like a star!\u201d", "Author": "OverworkedUnderpaid", "ReviewID": "UR50458675", "Content": "Almost pointless reviewing this hotel... it gets great reviews across the board! I was here for 8 nights on business, and from the moment I arrived I felt like a star. Check in was personalised and friendly. I was given a room on the executive club floor so I had complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canapes included. What a treat!! A glass or two of champagne before popping out for dinner! Room was huge. The bed was massive! I felt like Alice in Wonderland climbing up onto it. The pillow menu was fabulous. My room though looked out over the internal atrium, so basically I never really opened the curtains. I was there for business though, so not in my room much (unfortunately!) Internet is payable. Bathroom fantastic with Molten Brown products. Nice touch. I used the gym a few times and found it to be very well equipped with 4 treadmills, bikes, cross trainers and even a spin bike. Lots of freeweights and space to stretch. As soon as someone finishes using the equipment somebody comes along to clean up. There are no windows though, and humidity is still high despite aircon. The pool is a dream. Proper infinity pool overlooking the Singapore river. It doesn't get the sun until about 11 am though (left hand side when you walk onto the pool area) and by 1pm the sun has moved so that it only hits the right hand side of the pool - where unfortunately there is only room for about 6 beds. That is a handy hint if its the sun you are after!! I didn't eat in any of the restaurants but I did have bar food and drinks in the Post Bar. There is a great terrace area which is beautifully lit at night, so you really get a feeling for the grandeur of the hotel. The mini burgers melt in the mouth by the way. Hotel is right on the river and about a 5 min walk to most of the financial business area. It is also a 5 min walk to Boat Quay with lots of bars and restaurants (including, oddly, a bar dedicated to Manchester United) Can't say enough about the quality of this hotel and the great service.

Here\u2019s my breakdown: Location: The hotel, while being located \u2018centrally\u2019 is not located in the \u2018heart\u2019 of the Singapore shopping district. (Namely Orchard Road) That said, Orchard Road is within a 12 minute drive away. Also, the area surrounding the Fullerton hotel is not short on things to do. The Fullerton is withing walking distance world class stores and restaurants. It is also within short walking distance to Singapore\u2019s landmark \u201cEsplanade\u201d and some of Singapore\u2019s premier bars. Security: Top Notch. Singapore is one of the safest cities in the world, and even if it wasn\u2019t this hotel makes it\u2019s guests feel at home and within solace. Cleanliness: This hotel is absolutely spotless. It also has a pleasant lingering scent to it. Staff: Staff are incredibly professional, the best of Asian hospitality. Friendly, and very mindful of guests. Character: The best of \u201cOld money\u201d Luxury. Definitely among the best, if not the best in Singapore. Facilities: This hotel is five star equipped. Expect to find, spas, pools, jacuzzi, banquet halls, business center, meetings rooms, state of the art gym and star restaurants on site. Points to note: This hotel does not just offer world class accommodation but also a perfect venue for weddings, lunches, banquets, meetings\u2026 etc I highly recommend this hotel and rate as Excellent with no second thoughts.", "Date": "June 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Location and Structure\u201d", "Author": "Mitwaa", "ReviewID": "UR32096674", "Content": "The Hotel is in very Centrally Located and all the attraction points are witing walking distance.

Anyway, of course they did it again anyway. Then, when no-one answered their knocks, they slipped a note under my door saying \"your laundry is ready for pick-up\"!!! I hadn't even submitted any laundry. (the note was supposed to say they wanted to make-up my room). When I checked in, the room was freezing so I turned off the air-con. Six hours later, it was still freezing. Having lived in Singapore for the past several years, I did not have any pyjamas with me. I was freezing in bed, so rung up Reception and asked someone to come and fix the air-con. Two men came up and had to enter the ceiling to switch off the valve. This was completed AFTER midnight and by this time I was freezing and absolutely exhausted. I had to sleep with my dressing-gown wrapped around me, socks on my feet, as well as a sheet and doona over the top.

The operator assured me they would fix the blinking light. This happened 7 times!! Eventually, they said someone would come up to the room........ they didn't turn up! Later, I had to call up and AGAIN ask for someone to come up and replace the phone. Many of the time I had to ring Reception and Concierge, no-one answered the phone. They also screwed up my breakfast order. So, how did the hotel atone for this? An apology when I checked out....that's it. This is not good enough. I particularly chose the Fullerton, so I'd get a good night sleep before flying red-eye the next night. If you are reading this, Fullerton management, a simple apology upon check-out is not good enough.

We stayed at the Fullerton last year with our two young children on a stopover on a trip back from the Maldives. The service was superb on all fronts and as a result we elected to stay again. We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight. This was naturally before check in so we were quite relaxed and understanding that our room might not be ready. Mind you on the last visit we arrived similarly early and they happily put us in a temporary room. At the check in desk, it seemed that the lady handling our check in had a room ready and was going to put us in it and when she sought to, clear it or whatever they do, with her supervisor. Unfortunately the lady on the desk saw it as an \u201cupsell\u201d opportunity and highlighted that our room was unavailable, but a higher quality room was if we would like to book it. The extra cost was to be around S$500 compared to the room we had booked that was S$400 per night. For a few hours this didn\u2019t seem all that worthwhile and we declined. Sensing something a little odd with how this unfolded, I asked if the hotel was 100% full and I was told yes. My wife and I then went and rested on the couches in the lobby. Very comfy they were and in 5-10 minutes my wife was out like a light. A further 10-15 minutes later, I guess this was noticed and a room was made available straight away. So with a little delay we were in a room and after a short nap we headed out. On return we were in our room, it was on the 7th floor with a balcony and view over the Boat Quay. The fit out of the rooms is superb and styling is very nice. Seems to me the styling of the rooms is a little more in keeping with the colonial/heritage nature of the hotel as compared to the lobby, which seems a bit out of kilter with the colonial/heritage nature of the hotel \u2013 a bit more modern when a heritage/colonial approach would have suited more. The view from the room and the balcony was also good. Breakfast was included in our rate and was very good as well. We used the pool and gym, both excellent, and the pool with a great view of the Boat Quay. We think the heritage nature of the building coupled with the location (particularly if in town for business which we were not) is what sets the hotel apart from many others. It also seemed to be pretty good value. A really good hotel, just the one annoyance at check in. Would we return. Yes.

The hotel also has a superb location right on the Singapore river, in the middle of downtown, with the Boat Quay and Clark Quay strips literally minutes away by foot, and the Colonial District and the Esplanade complex also directly across the river via a small 19th century footbridge. On my most recent visit I tried one of the base grade courtyard rooms for the first time - keep in mind even these base grade rooms can come in at the better part of US$500 a night including breakfast. The room was furnished to the same standard as all the other rooms I've had there and have almost all of the same amenities - but no i-pod docking station for example. As the name suggests these rooms look into the hotel's huge internal glass roofed atrium. I was on the second to top floor of the hotel so very close to the roof and I found this let in plenty of natural light notwithstanding the internal view but I dont know how well this would work if you were on one of the floors nearer the ground floor. What I did notice was that this room grade is smaller than the others and I know you can get much larger rooms in other 5 star hotels in Singapore with an outside view for less. With 2 people and their luggage in the room there is still room to swing a cat - but only just. The other thing I noticed is that in the afternoons there is a pianist playing in the lobby which is great - except that the music is very audible in the room which wasn't great when you have jet lag and want to rest during the day.

Having merely requested for a \" Higher floor suite \", we didn't realised we were being allocated a historical corner suite, room 777, on the 7th floor of the Hotel. This suite, as highlighted on its website, is where our former Minister of Finance's office used to be. This ultra quiet suite certainly has lots of WOW factor - possibly being only one of its type in this hotel, it has a 4-5 meter long balcony, easily accommodating 8-10 people, facing the ever-changing beautiful skyline of the Marina Bay of downtown Singapore! What a sight! We were really happy for what we were being allocated . Though the sitting area, which was separated from the bedroom area, wasn't huge, it was certainly comfortable even for 4-6 adults. Bedroom has a huge King sized, high bed, looks and does feel very very comfy. More surprises were to come - huge walk-in wardrode area, followed by a gigantic bathroom .... easily 900-1000 square feet for this beautiful suite! The suite also has these amenities - two flat screen Panasonic TVs with 30 TV channels, coffee and tea making facilities, kettle, free champagne, huge plate of fresh fruits, big box of chocolates, mineral drinking water, Bvlgari toiletries, iron and ironing board, etc The swimming pool on the 2nd floor, though quite small, was perfectly formed for a short and scenic swim, in the midst of downtown CBD, Singapore.

However, there are some serious issues with the dampness of the hotel. After a few days of mild dampness, we started noticing that paperwork was damp to the touch, and our clothes (in the wardrobe) were also damp. The bedding, even inside the bed, was by the third night unacceptably damp, accompanied by an overwhelming smell of dampness, causing us to complain. We were shown 4 other rooms ending at midnight, when we gave up and went to sleep in our dank bedroom. The highlight of the 4 was a room on the front of the building which did not smell of damp like the others, but which had condensation 'inside' the double glazing, obscuring the view of the very noisy road below. We checked out this morning and moved to the Fairmont. Instantly more friendly than the staff at the Fullerton, I felt welcomed right away and have been upgraded to the executive floor. I have a view of the water and the city, a balcony, and DRY BEDDING. What more could you ask for. I wouldn't say never stay at the Fullerton as it is a nice hotel in a good location, but make sure to complain right away if you have any problems with dampness and make sure they put you in a room to your liking.

The breakfasts were extensive and had options of Cook to prepare what you want re eggs and omlettes on request. From 6pm til 8pm you can go to the lounge and have as much Champagne or cocktails as you wish whilst enjoying buffet sushi and canapes of a very high standard including Asian and western options.

The Fullerton is in an excellent position and if you book a cab fom the room , one will appear in 5 minutes in the foyer and you just have to provide your booking number. $2.50 sing booking fee and about another $5 to anywhere thats imprtant in SIngapore such as Orchard Rd, Suntec City shopping or the fabulous VIVO City shopping Mall near Sentosa that you must see. You ca walk in 5 minutes to the underpass that links Metro stations and walkways to the linked malls if you ca stand the Singapore humidity. Fullerton Hotel is well maintained and definately 5 star but being a newish (8 years) hotel in an old building there are a few issues and compromises that are only a problem if you look for them like high windows and some water damage in walls of room but no mould smell. Bvlgari toiletries, granite tiled bathrooms and two LCD tv s and DVD in room. Room service food is excellent and cheap..just stay away form alcohol and buy it at shopping malls for a fraction of the price. A $18 (after taxes) local beer is hard to swallow in the room! more like $3 at the supermarket. Highly recommend this hotel and got a rate of under $US450 a night so excellent relative value.

Would I stay again? No, but then I am a big fan of the Ritz-Carlton in SGP and I was disappointed by the Fullerton. Firstly, I was disappointed by my room. A large number of rooms go to the inside court ie no proper daylight. I asked to be given a room with daylight (not necessarily bay view). After a lot of checking, I was offered a room abt $75 higher then my corporate rate. I told them I like a room at my corp rate where I can see the sky and was then given a room with city view. Unfortunately, it was right next to an office block and as the Fullerton is not very high I needed to keep my curtains closed at all time to avoid the feeling that somebody looked straight into my room. I guess I should have settled for the court view as the result was the same, drawn curtains and no sky. The room in itself was pretty but not particularly spacious (although the bathroom is huge) and a lot of room was taken by a large desk. As there was not that much space the luggage rack with my suitcase was pretty much always in my way. This room is too small if there are two of you. The building is a converted post office and ceilings are also not very high, adding to the feeling of a small space. Obviously, the hotel has also bigger rooms \u2013 just I was not in one. At check-in I enquired abt internet connection and was told all the info is in the room. In the room I found a general info booklet, however, it refer re internet to another publication. I could not find the relevant info and in the end I just used my laptop when I went to a Starbucks (free WIFI in SGP). The gym and pool neither impressed me. The pool is on a small concrete plateau (3 or 4 floor) with a pretty view over the river, but there is little space around the pool to sit and hardly any vegetation. It rather has a cramped feeling and it is not a place to stay for long. The Ritz in contrast has a tropical garden which almost makes you forget you are in a city. The gym is okay but not particularly big, nor pretty. I only tried the restaurant for breakfast which is very beautiful and has an airy feeling. You almost could think you are in the South of France. I very much liked it as it did not have that big business hotel feel to it. Overall I would not recommend the place and was very disappointed. While it is silly to whine abt a 5 star hotel, in this part of world you get so much more for your money, why bother with the Fullerton?", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cOrdinary.\u201d", "Author": "adviserrr", "ReviewID": "UR16299776", "Content": "This was my first stay.

On food, the club floor breakfast was limited (2 choices of cereal?) and the main restaurant was again just not great. One final gripe - the vast and impressive lobby areas had many tables and sofas but most were tagged as \"reserved\" (for who?) and most tables had dirty cutlery, cups etc. It was pretty obvious that the people who had the coffee/food had long left the tables - simply unsightly and poor hygiene.

You expect this in older Japanese hotels, but not anywhere else at these rates. Other hotels in Singapore are more spacious and cheaper. As others here have commented, the mattress is hard. If you like hard, fine. Personally I could not sleep. Not helped by airconditioning that struggles to keep up with demand. So warm and humid nights spent on an uncomfortable bed. Bathroom is better - about the same size as the room? Has most of what you would expect, but materials and finish just not first class. Furniture in the room getting worn as well. Nice large cups for making tea or coffee. But the hotel information books bound in leather had swollen into the wooden slots in their drawer and could not be pulled out. Interior atrium public space is generous. Elsewhere the design of the building means the swimming pool and coffee terrace are squashed in between the hotel and the sidewalk.

The gym is good, with a range of resistance and cardio machines. It will allow a reasonable workout for most. Dumbbells go up to 50 pounds. The hotel is located in a pleasant riverside site. As most have mentioned, it's right on one of the quays. It's right across the river from the excellent Museum of Asian Civilisations (which I highly recommend). No major negatives, other than it can take a few minutes for a taxi to arrive, and it's not particularly convenient to Orchard Rd. We had a corporate rate, which ended up being around 50% of prices listed on Tripadvisor. At the corporate rate, it's obviously good value, but I don't know that I would have felt it particularly good value at retail rates. Whilst I enjoyed my stay, I'll probably stay at the Stamford next time (which has a better gym, and is closer to Orchard Rd, Raffles and so on).", "Date": "January 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable luxury\u201d", "Author": "allergymom", "ReviewID": "UR12831593", "Content": "Stayed at the Fullerton with my husband and 6-year old while I was in Singapore for a conference.

However, I was in for a disappointment. While the public areas of the hotel were beautiful, and the room and bathroom were large and impressive, the hotel is let down by the average service levels of its employees. The hotel's employees seem to have forgotten that the hotel's past reputation alone cannot sustain its future, parrticularly in a country filled with hotels known for their excellent service. One glaring example was when I checked in and was wrongly given a smoking floor room. I then pointed out the error and asked whether it would be possible to be placed on the same non-smoking floor as my colleague who had checked in seconds before me. However, I was given a room on another floor without an explanation or even a response to my request. I had to actually ask whether all the other rooms on my colleague's floor were full, to which I received a curt nod. Incidentally, when my colleague went up to her designated room, to her shock it was already occupied by someone else - definitely not the kind of mistake you would expect of a top notch hotel. The other staff I encountered were generally pleasant but not particularly warm, making their pleasantness seem rather artificial. I must however single out Tania at the concierge's desk, who was genuinely warm and truly helpful - she stood out a mile from her colleagues. The other thing I should note is that the breakfast buffet was disappointing in terms of the variety of food available. Having stayed at the Intercontinental late last year and experienced their superb breakfast, I can safely say that the Fullerton's spread is sadly lacking in many respects.

I liked the location of the Fullerton the best out of all the better hotels in town, close enough to Boat and Clarke Quays and Raffles Landing, and nearby the junction of two Metro Lines. Check in was painless and the room was as requested with a balcony and view of the river. Unless you're a hard core shopper who must be right on top of Orchard Road, the location's good. The other cluster is where the Ritz-Carlton,Oriental, Pan Pacific and Marina Mandarin are located, all nearby to Raffles. I did check out Raffles during out stay, nice for historic reasons but the rooms are a bit dark for my tastes. We ate breakfast everyday at the hotel. The buffet's very good but not the best I've ever had. As always, the egg/omlet man was either a feast or famine situation. One day, perhaps Christmas day, they moved the breakfast to a function room in the basement. It was not a good situation and being only two, asked us to share a table or wait forever. If not raining and not in the basement, one can also eat outdoors which is quite pleasant. Other than breakfast, we did not eat at the hotel. The hotel bar is quite nice and further, they make excellent drinks. Well mixed with generous pours. Hotel itself, like many places in Singapore, is non-smoking except for the bar and perhaps some designated guest rooms. Rooms have broadband connectivity and mini-bars. One odd thing was that the AC, needed for the high humidity, would power down along with the lights when you took your room key out of the power slot by the door. I found this rather perplexing given the local conditions. Staff were very helpful in sorting out anything. Whether it was directions, finding a restaurant or tourist destination, getting transport, etc., they were efficient. I rate this hotel highly for its location. The physical facility and staff are also first rate. Here's the downside: They need to sort out the A/C power being connected to the room's mains switch. They also need to 1) refurbish the main eating room where breakfast is served and 2) spruce up the breakfast offerings and also make the buffet itself more attractive and user friendly.", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cGood but not the best\u201d", "Author": "Woodai", "ReviewID": "UR6787596", "Content": "I stayed at the Fullerton for 2 nights on a business trip.

Because of it's location, we chose this hotel as we wanted to be close to the countdown where the fireworks will be when the clock strike 12 on 31 Dec midnight. Our arrival onto the hotel was a disappointment, the porters were nowhere in sight. The taxi driver and my partner brought down the luggage from the boot whereas I went around looking for porters. Finally, found them at their desk behind the pillar. 1st dissappointment. The check-in was just like another regular procedure, there was no welcoming message from the front desk. It was like just another routine check-in for her. We booked an Atrium 'Sun-lit' room due all other rooms are fully booked. The room decor was alright, nothing fanstastic. The so-called sunlit room was not lighted up by the sun at all. It was dark in the room throughout the day unless we turned on the lights. Worst was that I found a cockroach in the bathroom on the 2nd day. Luckily, it was very still on the wall, if it flew around the bathroom, I would have fainted! Called the housekeeper and got rid of the cockroach. Talking about the bathroom, the quality of the towels given were lousy, they weren't thick nor gave you a luxurious feeling. We stayed in several hotels in Singapore before, I must say the really impressive one is Ritz Carlton, you should have compared the bathroom amenities between the two hotels. Talking about service, Fullerton is nowhere comparable as well. Our check-out was just another standard check-out procedure. There was no 'do visit us again' message. Overall, we feel that staying in Fullerton, you do not really feel welcome, you don't feel warmth at all. Personally, I think this hotel is over-rated.

The hotel rooms were nice but you could see where they cut costs. Cheap soaps, the sheets could have been nicer and the odd configuration of the rooms is annoying. The desks where not very comfortable for working. The two rooms I stayed were hard to navigate. Furniture was and fixtures where in strange juxtaposition. I kept finding myself bumping into things. Make sure you do not get the cheapest rooms. They either look over the atrium, which is fine if you have an aversion to natural light, or they're tiny. The Grand Hyatt (club level) had the best room. Great layout with a closet that opened to both a large bathroom and the main room. The desk area was comfortable, ergonomic and even had a desk plate with AV hookups for VGA, S-Video & RCA to the 40in plasma and room sound system. The Four Seasons had excellent service, great food (much better than the Fullerton) and nice spacious rooms. The bathrooms were very large.

The arrival was perfect; all of the staff were excellent and attentive, however, I had booked a room with either a sea or river view; we received a room with no view, except that of the pillar at the side of the hotel, however, to their credit, they swiftly changed our room and apologised unreservedly. I was impressed with the way in which reasonable (though a little small) sized rooms have been carved in to a historic building. The rooms provided everything you needed for a relaxing stay. You get exactly what you see on the website. I would not say the rooms provided anything exceptional for a five star hotel, but I have no complaints in any way at all. The staff were absolutely excellent. My wife, son and I accidentally stayed on in the pool one night, about 20 minutes beyond it's closing time. Rather than disturbing us or informing us of his presence, the staff member remained indoors, in a location where we could not see him, and he waited to lock up until we had left. The business centre staff went the extra mile to find the difficult services that I needed. They also arranged for a scientific poster to be printed for me within 20 minutes. The deli/cafe staff are excellent too, and made up some special food for my son. The concierge is wonderful and mapped out a host of things for us to see, do and eat. However, the restaurant staff are a little hit and miss; some were excellent, some were rude; also, we booked a room with champagne breakfast included, and there was no champagne at breakfast (not that we would have had champagne at breakfast). The location is excellent. The hotel is a few minutes walk from the metro, cabs are easy to get, and the walk along the river is fantastic in the evening. The pool is amazing. It's not huge, grand or exceptional in any particular way, however, you will be awestruck when swimming in it at night. Looking out whilst swimming, you have an amazing view of the city and the beautiful river walkway. You become awestruck and just remain at the side of the pool once you notice this.

I have marvelled at the architecture, savored the food, and on every stay, I have lamented the mis-cues. If you are visiting Singapore from outside of Asia and looking for a centrally located and aesthetically pleasing experience, you will probably enjoy the Fullerton. Business travelers may find some nits to pick, but on no account will they feel uncomfortable or unloved. In a part of the world where the market for five star hotels is highly competitive, I feel that the Fullerton tries hard but not quite hard enough. To be sure, the rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff are competent, with the odd exception of the wait staff at Town restaurant. Housekeeping in particular does a great job. Transportation is efficiently arranged, and the concierges know their art. What doesn't work as nicely are the touches that frequent travelers expect to reduce the hassle of living away from home. Retro-fitting a historic building for modern purposes is challenging, and management cut corners here. The room decor was clearly done on the cheap. Trying to find a free plug for both your computer and mobile phone requires a few minutes of hunting on bent knees. Almost every room I have stayed in required the attention of housekeeping to make the electric outlet in the bathroom charge my razor. Want to play a DVD and wind down? Better call housekeeping for a player; unlike many top hotels, there isn't one in your room when you arrive. Nor will you find the complimentary broadband that, if nothing else, saves clicking through four annoying windows every 24 hours in order to re-activate the service. And the service itself is slower than what I enjoy at home despite the elevated daily cost. Perhaps my greatest opprobrium, however, is saved for the health club's paucity of treadmills. When your hotel is on the Equator, it should be a given that a number of your (aspiring) health-concious guests may not want to brave 25+ degrees Celcius with attendant humidity to get in a jog before work. Waiting in line to get exercise should be a thing of the past. If you want to get good value for money in the general vicinity, try the Pan-Pacific Hotel. If you want an elevated level of service and comfort, then the Ritz Carlton might well be your destination.
