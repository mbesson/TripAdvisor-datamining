We were on the first floor and you could hear everything from the hall - footsteps, doors opening/closing, etc. Breakfast was good. I appreciated being able to make a waffle. I was annoyed that even though I pre-paid for the room, they wanted an extra $5 occupancy fee before I checked out. Also, the exit gate from their lot does not open automatically. You have to go inside and ask them to open it. My husband said that they had to use a mop handle to work the contraption that opened the gate. With a charge of $16/night for parking, you'd think they would be able to have a working gate. All things considered, the price was good and the location was good.

Housekeepers are standing behind this gentleman talking on cellphone. As more people pour in and are having their luggage stored as well because....\"housekeeping hasn't brought the list\" he seems to look down and says he will take the next person waiting. So it's us and he assigns us a smoking room on floor 4. We requested non-smoking. He says the person on the shift before him assigned all the rooms per request.
