We were quoted a \"CLC\" price of $55.+tax. We were told yes to truck parking(we drive a semi), yes to micro/fridge in the room, yes to pets(no extra charge). We made the reservation. $142.00. The clerk wouldn't tell us the CLC rate at check-in( I was curious).....there was an extra fee for a pet $15.....and no micro/fridge in the room. Our clerk told us he \"would bring them to us in a few minutes.\" UNbelievable! He showed up with a hand truck and the micro/fridge.....both were disgustingly grubby. The room was gross and smelled funky AND we didn't get the CLC price from expedia.

I arrived and was given a rather run-down room at the far end of the hotel that had no wireless internet signal whatsoever. Between that and noticing that two doors down was an apparent hotel live-in guest with friends present and the burning smell of \"happy plant\" in the air, I went back to the office and was told that I would need to be located near the front of the building in order to connect to the Internet. So, I switched rooms. The room was worse a dump than the first dumpy room. I still had no internet signal, but needed to connect to keep in touch with my employer. Back to the office I went. It turned out that the desk clerk had no idea which router Days Inn was using for me to connect to. Usually hotels have a router with their designated name, but this hotel had a store-purchased router that was still under the brand name and once I connected I was fine. However, during the course of the evening I became nervous when the tenants at the far back of the hotel near the room I had first checked into (quite apparently not guests, but actual hotel tenants) had traffic coming and going at all times of the night, I lost count after 23 visitors in the course of 6 hours. I'm no dummy, having grown up in the inner city as a child and seeing firsthand the types of activities that some of the neighbors were involved in, and this was clearly not a scenario of multiple friends dropping in constantly. Between the constant stream of visitors between 10 PM and dawn with their loud rap music thumping away, I got no sleep, and I had to constantly peer out of the curtains to be sure my rental car had not been stolen or damaged. I gladly checked out the next day and would never set foot onto this piece of property ever again! Filthy, run down, apparently catering to welfare housing clients, with a constant stream of incoming-outgoing visitors who were not registered guests. Scary place! I would have felt safer walking with a wallet full of bills in downtown Detroit at 3 in the morning. And....although all my other hotel stays around this time period credited my Trip Reward points to my account, to this very day the Days Inn has yet to submit my points to my account and I have had to register a complaint with the Trip Rewards program. I highly advise that if you need a place in Indianapolis to stay for an evening, keep driving right by this one!", "Date": "September 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flemington, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cOkay\u201d", "Author": "baldknobbers", "ReviewID": "UR5715000", "Content": "We stayed at the Days Inn on South Keystone Ave in Indianapolis (there is more than one Days Inn in Indy) Overall the room was okay.
