{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good place It's a hotel run by a family. The hotel can be described as a low-cost, or budget place to stay. It is located somewhat remotely, but there are buses nearby that can take you cheaply to the centre and other places of interest within 10-15 minutes, and the area is peaceful and quite (no crowds of tourists). The room was clean and tidy. It is cleaned every day. We did not like the absence of a fridge in the room. Otherwise recommended if you value your money. (Getting a place in the centre is in my opinion not worth it. The prices are ridiculously high and the service is not good).", "Date": "Oct 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR800052842", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "samppa"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d530010-r10413568-Hotel_Gavinana-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "530010", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
