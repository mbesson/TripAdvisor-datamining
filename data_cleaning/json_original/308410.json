{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Absolutely hated this placed! DO NOT STAY HERE! When you read the other reviews you will see that the hotel is old, tired and badly in need of renovations. Our room was on the 4th floor, had salt damp in the walls of the room, water damage on the floor, bathroom very old and dirty, smelt like it had not been cleaned for a year. The breakfast was awful, okay if you like omeletes or fried eggs but apart from that only noodles, rice, stir fried veggies and meat, not my choice for breakfast. There was bread and croissants but so many people staying there did not use the tongs and were loading up their plates with 15 to 20 of these pastries, obviously to take back to the room.....no manners whatsoever.Went down to the pool on first day, could not get a chair either on the beach or by the pool, looks like people get down there early in the morning and place towels on the chairs. Went and asked a staff member if they had more chairs and they looked at me like I was stupid! Ended up going out for the day for the Nusa Dua Beach Cafe, near Nikko Hotel at Nusa Dua, spent the whole day there on the beach with a free lounge chair and umbrella as we had lunch at the cafe. This place is brilliant and just such a beautiful beach, fantastic food and soo cheap compared to the prices you would pay in a resort. Every day we went out as we could not bear to stay in the revolting smelly hotel, supposed to be 5 stars but I would only give it 2 and that is being generous.If eating out in Nusa Dua I would recommend going to Bualu Village for dinner, so many nice restaurants, Nyomans, La Laguna and Chees Bar; these places are so cheap, half the price of what you would pay in the resorts for food and drink. Another beautiful place to spend the day is Tao's at Benoa, part of the Ramada Hotel but anyone can go there, use the pool with towels and have a beautiful lunch, watersports, etc.After having travelling extensively, and returning to Bali for my 15th time I would never again stay at Nusa Dua, this is not the real Bali, my recommendation would be to stay at Sanur and Ubud, you can stay at fabulous accommodation for less than half the price you would pay in Nusa Dua.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR207917849", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "GOOLIEGIRL10"}, {"Content": "Make your vacation up sad It was a very old and terrible room I ever seen.

The other hotels in the resort are 5 star luxurious hotels. This hotel in its day was beautiful but it has had little repair or upkeep in the last few years.The rooms are basic but spacious, although slightly mould. The ground are nice but again in need of repair. I would not stay at this hotel again. It served it purpose as a base while we traveled around bali but out of 3 weeks we only slept in the hotel on 6 nights.We reported a broken railing in the swimming pool which was rusted through and would fall on someone swimming very shortly . It was not just a small rail it was a large centre piece which divided the main pool from the kiddies pool, it really was very dangerous especially as there were many kids playing around it.

When we arrived we were quite surprised to find the room to be quite a lot mroe basic than we had thought it would be. The rooms are clearly old and in need of an update but we knew this before we went but honestly the bathroom looked like it had been fitted in the 70s and that the cleaners maybe gave it a wipe and that was about it as it was very brown and marked all over the place (and from speaking to others ours sounded like one of the better looking rooms!) The bed was comfy enough but we had 2 geckos in the room for the whole two weeks we were staying there which kept us awake each and every night and were impossible to get rid of. We also recieved 5 - 6 phone calls to our room in the first 10 days we stayed there from timeshare companies selling us other holidays etc who we really had to get aggressive with before they would stop calling us (in my view in other hotels this is probably stopped at reception but the receptionists at the Inna Putri Bali don't really seem to care too much). We also tried to arrange to have our room a little longer or to have access to a courtesy room on the last day we left (as we weren't going to the airport until 4pm). The hotel said we could not keep our room but said that we didn't have to be out of it until 12 noon although the cleaners knocked on the door every 5 minutes from 11am until we left! They also laughed when we asked if we could have access to a courtesy room and looked at us like we were stupid. Thankfully we met another couple who were staying there and could use their room for a shower etc but I think this is something to bear in mind if you have a really late flight out (which thankfully we didn't!) Overall we had a good 2 weeks in Bali despite all the problems mentioned above at the hotel (and there are more I haven't covered). I would recommend going to the Ritz Spa if anyone is into their Spas as a day here is amazing and the Thalasso Pool is worth the \u62e230 odd that you pay for 2 hours in it. The main general point I would make about Bali is that it looks beautiful and is beautiful photograph wise but I wouldn't go again. You have to pay for a visa on the way in and then also pay an amount to leave at the airport too. You will, I guarantee, be hassled like you have never been hassled before when you are there - for us this was by the hotel staff, the taxis outside the hotel and basically anyone Balinese you come into contact with! The taxi drivers are a complete pain and because there are so many of them you can't escape them. If I was ever to go to Bali again I would ensure I didn't stay in the Inna Putri Bali and would probably not stay in Nusa Dua as it seems to be targeted by all companies in Bali because most of the tourists to Bali stay there.The couple we met while there were staying in Bali for a month and honestly said to us that they were jealous of us when we were heading home as the amount of hassle you get from everyone does your head in!", "Date": "Sep 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR654852176", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "lancashire_lass27"}, {"Content": "Don't even think to stay there!!!       the floor of our updated room", "Date": "Jul 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR243991637", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "elenabgr"}, {"Content": "good but in need of updating The Inna Putri Bali is right next to Nusa Dua beach.The room we stayed in was clean but in need of repairs, the bath leaked, there was a problem with the electricity and there were ants in the bathroom.For all the time we were in the hotel room it was OK.

We paid $20pp for a day around the island and $15 pp for the day out at the elephant park and that included the lunch buffet!! and we had the airconditioned transport to ourselves, any of the guys will do the trips for you that wait outside any hotel, book em, we had no problems, infact it was great to have the driver to yourself as you can stop anyhwere, anytime and get those photos.If you want to be pampered in a swish hotel and don`t mind paying for it, don`t go to the puti bali, however if you want a clean low budget hotel in a cracking spot on the beach, within walking distance of shops, bars and restaurants then book itBy the way ask for mumbal at the laguna graden, he`s usually behind the bar, ask him if he likes watching the tom hanks film the green mile, then say martin and sharon say hello!!", "Date": "Mar 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR772516706", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "clayxblade"}, {"Content": "In need of an overhaul The hotel needs some renovations.
