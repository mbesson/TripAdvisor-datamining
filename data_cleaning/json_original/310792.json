Marble hotel is in face exactly what you are paying for. It is neither a dump nor a deluxe resort. Firstly, i've stayed in Marble, Grandstar, Nippon, Grand Oztanik and few other hotels several times during last few years privately and business wise, so i know what i am talking about. Main thing that you have to keep in mind when booking Marble is - location. Probably the best in Istanbul. That is if you are interested in walking through city's artery Istiklal, do a little shopping, try some bars, see people and enjoy some nightlife. If you just want to only see culture & visit city attractions and after that rest in your hotel withour trying some restaurants, bars, nargile or other things Istanbul is famous for, go somewhere else. But keep in mind that there is literaly NOTHING to do after nighfall. Regarding Marble and good side of staying there, location is great with everything in just few steps from hotel (taxi, tobacco, good food, money exchange, bars, shops, restaurants, Istiklal street), view is nice (if you book Bosphorus view), breakfast is little bit \"stronger\" then before so it is fair enough, hotel even has parking free for guests (which is good in this part of the town). Some rooms do look little bit worn out, but for the price you are paying - come on. I've stayed in all kind of rooms there, and generally, hotel is ok. Some rooms facing Siraselviler Cadessi can be noisy due to Turkish need to horn & play loud music in their cars, specially during weekend. So, when booking it, ask for a room on upper floors of the hotel. If you are a normal person that needs a normal, clean room where you will spend few hours sleeping after wondering around the town whole day, then Marble is your choice. If you're looking for some place where you will enjoy your free time, relax in a big hotel lobby or whatever similar, then book some other hotel.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cAverage & accepted Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Uschi-Cairo", "ReviewID": "UR83447646", "Content": "I stayed there a week and went to my room only for sleeping.

The best thing about the Marble is its location, just a short walk from Taksim Square and many restaurants. The hotel has a large lobby area and a bar. The breakfast, which is served on the first floor, has a good selection of continental breakfast items. The breakfast room also has great views of the Bosphorous. Finally, WiFi is free but seemed to be off-and-on at times. All of these things are nice, but the rooms are where guests will spend most of their time at the hotel, and the rooms at the Marble look like something from the 1960s. The furniture is worn, and the door to my room had to be pushed hard to get it to open more than a crack. My room did not have much of a view, which was OK. However, the air conditioning system was inadequate. I understand that many hotels do not have A/C, but this one advertises it and has a thermostat on the wall. Therefore, I expected some cooling, especially with temperatures in Istanbul reaching 30C. The A/C had about the same impact on the room temperature as leaving the fridge door open. To make matters worse, the staff were inconsistent. Two days before I checked out, I requested a late departure (2:00 p.m.). I realize that a request like this cannot be guaranteed, and I was grateful when the clerk at the front desk said \"It will not be a problem\" and typed a note into the computer. The morning of checkout, I went to the front desk and confirmed the 2:00 p.m. departure, and a different clerk said \"That is not possible.\" When I told him that a different clerk had confirmed that it was OK, he said \"What was his name?\" and denied that there was any note in my record.

The air conditioning was noisy and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep until your turn it off. They didn't make any replacement for the soap and other utilities. No variety on the daily breakfast with no big choice. We asked for some drinks in the lobby (whiskey) and they only had J&B. Finally the staff was barely friendly and inflexible.

The hotel has a sauna and swimming pool, but we never visited them as Istanbul was too exciting to spend time in the hotel unnecessarily. There are two types of rooms, ones that look over the Bosphorous and others that overlook a main street. As we had booked a package, we got the main street which could be quite nosiy...especially if you are on a lower level and a light sleeper (no double glazing to be had here). The rooms are a little tight, definitely no room for any extra beds. In general the place in clean. There were a few problems with the AC and the room keys at times, and the TV needed to be smacked every now and then in order to get any sound. However, for two girls sharing a room, there was definitely not enough closet space, drawers or hangers to accommodate all our attire. So new shopping got thrown around the room along with the old. Breakfast was monotonous as the same plates were served up every morning and they were not that exciting, however the view from the breakfast room more than made up for any lack of variety. Overall, a decent enough hotel which I would visit again, if you want something safe and clean, as ultimately you don't spend that much time in the hotel anyway when Istanbul has so much to offer and more...", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marble Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d310792-Reviews-Marble_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$125 - $287*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Syraselviler Cad.
