I've heard a lot of good things about this hotel so I was excited to check out this hotel. This hotel was a perfect getaway with my girlfriend and it exceeded our expectations. We drove one car as reading the reviews from this site indicated that parking is quite expensive to help reduce our costs. My cousin actually lives in the area so we parked the car at her condo. If you are going to drive and park - I would recommend the parking lot across the hotel as it offers a competitive price to all the other lots in the area. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. The ambience of the hotel was amazing and the staff are extremely nice and sincere. Sam the manager checked me in and upgraded me to a balcony room which gave a beautiful view of the city line. This was perfect for valentines day and my girlfriend loved the view. Unfortunately the balcony door wasn't working so we couldn't go outside - but since this was a free upgrade, I really couldn't complain. The room was extremely spacious with a LCD TV and washroom was really clean. The bed was really comfortable and the cleaning staff were really nice. I left my phone in the room and the cleaning staff were really nice to hang on to the phone for me. One of the downsides of this hotel was that there was no refridgerator in the room but there was a safe for your valuables. We did not visit the pool or the restaurant - hence I cannot comment on it. There is a starbucks connected to the hotel which was really convenient. In all this hotel made our Valentines day memorable and I will definitely be back.

The room was modern & mostly clean/in good shape (we found a few stray hairs on the bed & the furnishings were a bit worn). The bathroom was nice, but there was an opaque window between the main room & the bathroom which didn't afford for much privacy (& would make it hard for someone to use the bathroom if the other person was trying to sleep).

The room I stayed in could use a detailed cleaning though (cobwebs, large number of marks on the walls, bathtub had some sort of film in it). The staff is courteous and friendly, and was very helpful in giving us ideas for how to get around the city as this was our first time visiting Toronto.

I did, however in retrospect I suppose I never had to even mention the hotel to the parking attendant and should've just kept my mouth shut so I could just pay the $15/day.

The hotel actually has a horseshoe driveway in the back of the hotel - I would recommend using this entranceway, since the main King St. West entrance is frequently occupied by taxis. Our checkin in great, our agent was Gloria and she worked on the night audit team. She was fabulous. Parking at the hotel is actually roughly $25/per night. We parked somewhere else the first night. From then on the trip was nothing short of a mess. Our room keys did not work. Fine. When we got to our (two double beds), the room was cramped. They are teeny, tiny. Ditto the bathroom. There are no hooks and little counter space. Beds are luckily comfortable. We registered our car with the hotel the next day. But when we came down the next day, there was a TICKET. It turns out that the parking attendants are \"ticket-happy.\" They decided to ticket our vehicle without checking to see that it was registered at the front desk. The front desk took care of the ticket, but it really soured our experience and I was really upset by the attitude taken by our agent. Instead of apologizing, they seemed to brush it off like it was a normal practice. Bad service. To make matters worse, our keys did not work (again) upon returning from dinner. When we went to get them reprogrammed, the agent was adamant that I had demagnetized them (they were in the hotel issued pack! and we had problems the night before!). Again, the agent seemed to insinuate that this was our problem - no apology, nothing. Again, bad service. Lastly, at 2:00am - the people next door to us had a party and decided to knock on our doors for fun. Suffice to say, the stay was TERRIBLE. At checkout the agent took care of our parking. However, I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all. There was a conference at the hotel and the whole atmosphere of the place is sterile and chaotic. There is just a cookie-cutter attitude and the service reflects this. Poor communication between different departments (night audit, parking and security) and simply abismal customer service.

So I will review the hotel itself and not the unwelcoming staff... Lobby: Quite beautiful. Apparently recently renovated. Beautiful colors and modern furniture. Ordered a dirty martini for $13 at the bar. Bartender was nice. Bar fully stocked with premium wine and spirits. Elevator did not label which floor had the gym/pool...I think they should work on that one since it would be an easy fix (It's on the 17th floor by the way). The TVs in the elevator could at least say something other than \"Register your car in the lobby.\" A directory would be nice. I did not eat at the hotel since there was a great selection of restaurants on King Street. (I DID receive complimentary fruit but didn't eat them all because they were mostly bruised) Internet: A STEEP $14/day BUT Starbucks right downstairs has FREE WIFI! And One_Zone High Speed Internet is the downtown Wifi hotspot that is usually cheaper than what Hyatt is offering. Fitness Center: State of the art fitness center with a spectacular view of the financial district. They also have a sauna in the locker rooms (a definite plus!). The equipment was new and well maintained. I actually worked out 3/4 of the time I was there. They offer headsets if you don't have one and towels. Wide variety of equipment for cardio, endurance and free weights. Maintenance staff came in about every 30 minutes to ensure cleanliness. Another plus... Rooms: I had a King. Beautiful view of the city. Other than the nasty hairs that housekeeping came to promptly clean up (and reset my room), it was very nice. Towels are kept in a cabinet under the sink (had to search for them at first). Shower has no rack to hold your towel so you have to either fling the towel over the glass door or walk into the cold bathroom across the floor to the towel rack. Toilet tissue holder was awkward, I had to take it off the holder to grab some tissue since it was somewhat free standing. The glass/window between the bathroom and bedroom kind of sucked because when hubby woke up to go to the conference and turned on the light in the bathroom, the whole room lit up...even after he closed the door. There is no way to block the window or stream of light coming from the restroom. The bed came with ample pillows though the mattress was a bit lumpy. Hubby and I ended up sleeping on the blanket and using an extra blanket from the closet to cover up with. The blanket helped smooth out the bed. There was no tv guide so we had to search for the channel listing just by flipping through to find something to watch by chance. Housekeeping was very prompt and efficient during turn down service...and very courteous (Edna was very nice :). Cooling/Heating systems in the room conveniently converts to Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. Pool: Outdoors (surprisingly for a Hyatt in the middle of a city that has predictably cold winters). It was closed but there was no hot tub either. Maybe one day they will invest in one. But there is a sauna in Male/Female locker rooms. Disappointed about the pool though... Entertainment: EVERYTHING is close by. Starbucks downstairs, Second City across the parking lot, Princess of Wales Theater (Saw Mary Poppins!), CN Tower a few blocks away, 2 blocks from St. Andrews Subway station (for shopping), Stadium down the street...EXCELLENT restaurants within walking distance. It truly was an excellent location. Parking: $29/night. Steep. Park across the street for 1/2 the price. Or at the garage across the street for about $10 less. There really is no difference in the walk across the street vs. parking in the garage downstairs that isn't even OWNED by Hyatt so...no $$ out of their pockets. OVERALL: Would definitely recommend this place to a friend. You may need to use SOME resources (parking, internet, etc.) outside of the hotel but overall, everything you need is at the hotel. It was an excellent location for a conference as there was one going on while I was there and there was no real 'crowd' in the lobby that made it apparent. the guests vs. conference visitors never really got in the way of each other.

There was also black body hair on my bed before I had climbed in (on the comforter, not the sheets). Despite setting my thermostat to 80 degrees, the room always felt cold. The lobby was different. Check-in seemed efficient, and the staff was friendly. It's a pleasant place to be. I did have connectivity issues with the Internet and I was never able to log in to the 30-minutes of complimentary Internet lobby use. All the incidentals in this hotel did seem to add up quickly.

The rooms are clean and trendily decorated. But they are small; the finishes are cheap and showing signs if wear; and -- most offensively -- there is no bath tub!! And I was told I was upgraded to a \"room with a view\" (of King St.). I hate to see a non-upgrade room. Also, not even a newspaper in the morning, a missing toilet bolt seemed to have been filled in with caulk, there was a rusty orange stain on some of the shower tiles on the floor -- as if a metal surface underneath had coroded -- and I found the mattress too firm. Between that and not being able to unwind in a nice hot bath before bed, I really didn't sleep well at all. None of the Hyatt's sins would be particularly offensive if the hotel was listed as a three star, but it's not. And how it got that extra star is beyond me. If I'd known what it was like, i'd've just paid the almost $100 more to stay in the three star hotel I normally stay at. At least then I could've had a nice bath in a well-maintained bathroom, and the price would've gotten me a suite.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cCould Be Better\u201d", "Author": "zebra1ny", "ReviewID": "UR119264311", "Content": "At first glance hotel looks nice, but on further inspection it's a bit shabby around the edges.

It's a nice initial impression and certainly a comfortable room. It is a lot more expensive than it deserves. Basically, in the common areas, it is a good business hotel that is masquerading as a fine hotel. It has the necessities but it's clear this is a remodeled Holiday Inn. Once arriving at the guest suites, they are efficient and visually pleasant, however, the attention again is to style over substance. There are four drawers that are very small, sock drawer size rather than meant for the rest of one's clothing. The bed has a comfortable mattress, however, the frame around the bed places the mattress far away from the headboard and the lighting system makes it somewhat difficult to read in bed. The furniture is modern but very impractical. The tv is 58\" or so and framed by a wood frame with a light above that is probably 2 feet wide on every side, room that could have been used for more stowage but is just a frame. The attention to this remodel was style, whereas a little substance would have been useful. The hotel is well located in the heart of the social scene and for that, it will be booked regularly. However, for the price, this hotel was fairly expensive relative to staying a subway stop or two away. Friends stayed two stops away for 1/3 the price. Also, it did not excite me to know that on the third morning I forgot to take my ipod out of the dock station by the bed and put it in the safe and by the time the maid cleaned the room (hint), it was stolen.

The second day it had been cleaned and was useable. When I started the tub jets I smelled something burning so I turned it off. Perhaps the smell was dust from lack of use?

BE WARNED there is quite the young party crowd in this hotel. In fact it was a little obnoxious on every turn there were partiers and loudness/disrespect. I would not return to this hotel with my young child. In fact, the smoke alarm went off at 3am (I see now in the reviews that this happened last weekend as well), a complete evacuation of the hotel. I am assuming it is from one drunk guy who decided to smoke or pull the fire alarm. Nonetheless I was very saddened to see young children roused in the middle of the night to stand on the street at 3 am. I would have been furious had my child have been with me. One final point about this: the fire alarm doesn't sound like a fire alarm. It sounds like a subway \"the doors are closing\" bell. A quicker reaction from patrons would no doubt ensue with a more stereotypical fire alarm sound. If you are going to stay here and are not going to be part of the 2 am entertainment district croud I highly suggest that you choose a room not on King Street and that you stay on a lower floor so that it's less distance to travel down the emergency stairs when the fire alarm goes off.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cDecent but nothing special\u201d", "Author": "allanng2004", "ReviewID": "UR116991895", "Content": "We arrived in Toronto at the beginning of August after a hectic six-day packaged tour of the East Coast.

No space in the bathroom for cosmetics, and only one small towel rack and no hooks for clothes or wet towels, nothing. The bed is designed so far away from the wall that you have to use a bolster pillow to reach the wall if you want to sit up in bed. No mirror in the room itself, only a door mirror on the inside closet door. Instead of putting a mirror by the small desk, they have some wooden design treatment. Would have helped to have a mirror there, since the bathroom is too small for putting on your makeup, especially if you are in the room with other people. Lighting awful. Too dim, and if you wanted to leave the bathroom light on for a night light there is a glass panel from the bedroom to the bathroom so it lights up the entire bedroom at night. The designer of these rooms should be publicly flogged. This is not typical Hyatt design, it's bizarre. Not functional at any level. Again, kudos to a very accommodating staff.

As such, the hotel has a policy that each guest must present a room key to a security guard after 10 pm to gain entrance to the elevators. But that doesn't help much. From 4pm until the next morning (~9 am) every time we went into the hallway, we encountered drunk people, including one guy who stumbled out of his doorway to yell after his buddy to buy him some more beer, a second (very buff, very tatooed) guy walking down the hallway with his beer, and a group of girls at a bachelorette party trying to get picked up by a soldier.

I am so glad we obtained a good deal to stay here because paying full price for this place would be depressing! Upon checking in for a 6 day stay we were advised that we had a king bed, that would have been lovely if we hadn't booked for 3 people. The arrogant person at the check in advised us as we hadn't gone through the hotel to book the room that securing 2 beds for 3 people is only something they can consider not ensure. Excuse me? We weren't asking for a better view, 3 people cannot sleep in one bed. We showed our booking info confirming we booked a triple room, this made no difference. The rude staff member advised us the hotel was booked out, amazingly enough after looking on his computer for no more than 10 seconds he found us an available room, amazing huh? 'insert sarcasm here'. From that moment it was downhill, maids removed our privacy sign and knocked on the door one morning just so she could get the room cleaned, we told her no. The privacy sign was never seem from again. They charge you $25 a night for parking, $14.95 for Internet use and even then the access code is for one device only at a time. This was the only hotel out of the 9 we stayed at where Internet wasn't included. In today's world you get Internet in shopping centers, restaurants so why not is it included when you are paying to stay here???

The positive experience started when we checked in after our international flight arrived in the morning and we appeared at the hotel at 9:30 am. Not only were we given a room (!) but it was a non-smoking, king bed, with a great view of the CN Tower which we wanted (thanks for setting us up Felicita!). The room was nicely sized and was decorated in a modern/trendy style. The bathroom is small and did not have a tub. The only complaint I had was that I agree with other reviewers there is very little storage space in the hotel room- there is ample closet space, but very few drawers and the ones there are are small and oddly shaped. That was more than offset by the location in the Entertainment District- centrally located to the CN Tower, the Islands, Chinatown and Kensington Market. While not right on the subway, the hotel is on a streetcar and a short 2 block walk to the subway. The service was outstanding. In addition to Felicita at the front desk, Dusty at the front desk let me walk behind the counter and use her own computer to print out my boarding pass when the kiosk to do it wasn't working, and Wesen on the valet staff gave my toddler son some toy balls as a gift when he was crying in the lobby.

I don't know enough about the Hyatt chain to appreciate whether the \"Regency\" line of hotels are there more budget... but regardless the summary of my experiences below do not reflect well on Hyatt or any 3 star + hotel. 1. Upon arrival I parked my vehicle on P2 and proceeded to walk toward the elevator. Someone who looked to be wearing an Engineering uniform exited from a non-labeled door and exited the area where one waits for the elevator. This staff person did not smile, did not hold the door for me or engage with me in any way. As a result, my suitcase became stuck as the door shut making a very awkward first impression. 2. The Front Desk seemed generally understaffed. I called to register my vehicle after using the kiosk check-in and was transferred by the operator to the F/D only to be put on hold for quite some time. I called back, explained to the Operator I had been placed on hold for several minutes. While he did take my plate and said he would register it, there was no apology or sense of urgency from the gentleman for me having been put on hold for some time. 3. I was initially checked into 1536. Decently sized room, modern in decor (identical to other photos posted here). Much to my surprise, I came across spots of urine on the toilet seat. When I called down, Sheena at the desk was quite polite and offered another room, but informed me that the Concierge was going to busy with another guest, so they wouldn't be able to come up and help me for 5 minutes or so, and suggested that I could either wait, or come down myself. Not really wanting to wait around in a dirty room, and since I had stuff I wanted to get to, I opted to go down myself. When I got down, I spoke with a Jose who appeared to be a manager (this was after a wait at the Desk of 2 or 3 mins. as all agents were busy - speaking to point #2). A bellman did approach me while waiting to make small talk which was a nice touch. Once speaking with Jose, he apologized and offered to upgrade me for the inconvenience to one of their \"view rooms\" overlooking the CN Tower and I was given 1912. I am not sure if Jose just didn't pick his words carefully or is newer and doesn't know his product well, both my original room 1536 and new room 1912 have views of the CN Tower, and while 1912 is a better view of the two, I wouldn't necessarily sell somoene of the CN Tower view when moving them from somewhere else that has a similar feature... especially as a means of compensation for a negative experience. 4. I called for Turndown Service when I went to the gym. I returned to the room to find the bed turned down nicely and the radio on, drapes drawn. But I had taken a shower on arrival and was surprised to see that the washroom had not been touched. The wet towels were still in the tub and no new towels had been given. Turndown service is normally considered a second, light, evening service... and while I wouldn't expect a full re-cleaning, I was surprised that the attendant didn't at least remove the old towels and provide a set of new ones. 5. The toilet doesn't flush properly. You need to hold down the flusher/handle until the bowl fills with water sufficiently for it to flush, you can't just push the handle and walk away. This is a very easy fix by a Maintenance person if reported (I will be mentioning it at check-out for the sake of the next guest). 6. Called for Room Service in the morning and ordered the Eggs Benedict and an Apple/Soy Shake. Food was good, but the shake is advertised with a Biscotti which never arrived... not a big issue, but worth mentioning in light of everything else. All in all my stay has been disappointing. Granted I got in on a very good rate, it doesn't leave me with a positive impression of Hyatt, which I had always regarded as being a very well run, service oriented organization. The only time during my stay and my MANY encounters with staff either at the desk, in the bar or over the telephone where my name was used was with the Room Service person, otherwise zero name recognition. Luckily I am a heavy sleeper, but as I sit at the desk in the room and write this review, I can clearly hear every word of the conversation of the gentleman next door. Perhaps its because I am sitting near the window where soundproofing is probably more challenging, but this might be a potential issue for any light sleepers. Truthfully I didn't notice this during the course of the night. I went down to the bar for a beer and to watch the hockey game. The hotel's proximity to the Entertainment District and probably many clubs meant there were young men and women coming in and out the entire evening (around 10-11pm) and were highly intoxicated. Not that this is the hotel's fault, and I understand they can't control the activities of guests in their room, a word to the wise that they too could be a noise problem. One woman, who could barely walk and must have been 19 if that, propositioned me as she walked out the elevators with her friends on their way to a club no doubt, granted she was joking. Regardless, the pricepoint and location of this hotel might make it attractive to the young party crowd. With so many accommodation options in Toronto, I just don't think Hyatt Regency makes the grade. I would urge others to stay elsewhere if looking for a truly indulgent stay.

I booked last-minute with a fantastic \"name your price\" deal on Priceline. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk was extremely friendly and pleasant. Contrary to previous reviewers, we did not have bad service or attitude because of our Priceline rate. Also, we did not have any problems with the speed of the elevators. Our room was on the 17th floor facing the CN Tower - lovely! It had very modern decor, with an extremely large TV and comfortable King size bed. I agree with other reviewers who had problems if you are staying longer - there is NO dresser and so there are very few places to unpack your clothes. The part I liked the least was probably the bathroom - it is tiny, it has a SLIDING door (strange), and there is frosted glass facing the rest of the room, which is private, but might not be comfortable for some. Also, though there is a very large shower stall, there is no bathtub, if that's important to you. The shower was great - very roomy, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. On the morning of our check-out, we called to request a late check-out and had no problems getting bumped back to 1pm. Again, the service was all very friendly. We had the privacy sign on the door and had no interruptions from housekeeping. All-in-all, a very pleasant experience for a great deal. The location is great - not only is it next to the entertainment district, but right across the street are many bars and restaurants great for a meal or just a drink.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe Worst Hotel Experience Of My Life!\u201d", "Author": "globaltraveller58", "ReviewID": "UR97523400", "Content": "I am a frequent-flyer who has stayed in all sorts of hotels all over the world.

The loss of my precious hand-luggage was the most frightening, devastating experience of my entire travelling career, but it has been made worse by the bizarre and arrogant actions of the hotel's General Manger who refused to have anything to do with me during my three days stay there.

As such, it has some aspects that travelers who routinely stay at a Hyatt may not be familiar with. On the plus side, the food at this Hyatt is fantastic. There is a small menu that ranges from nachos and burgers to refined dishes such as Tom Yum soup or lamb. Presentation is top notch, portions are a good size, and prices are in line with the area. The fitness area is located on the 17th floor. We were told it had been renovated recently and the equipment was very good by hotel standards. There is an outdoor pool which is closed over the winter months. Staff at this property were very helpful. The front desk, room cleaners, and food servers were all friendly. Were the staff not so responsive to our needs, this review would not have been as positive as it is. On the down side, this property physically does not measure up to a main line Hyatt. The rooms are small by Hyatt standards and the modern decor does not make the room more comfortable (it limits storage, lighting, and flex space). The room we stayed in needed to be cleaned as the carpet still had a lot of dirt sitting on it. The sheets were frayed, and the mattress was so soft my wife and I rolled towards the sagging middle as we slept. The washroom also displayed indicators of lax preventative maintenance as the tub caulking was showing mold as was the tile grout. We stayed at this hotel for a week and only one of our nights were disturbed by noise form other guests. The majority of our stay was quiet and uneventful, which is what I expect. Nearby spots to visit include TIFF (next door) as well as a variety of restaurants along the street. Overall our stay was quite good and this is a good hotel.

The room was recently modernized and was very trendy and featured: a large flat screen tv built into a curved wall with wood veneer, accented with red and white painted wood; a comfortable king bed, with a built-in headboard which matched the tv unit; a modern walk-in double shower with glass doors (no tub), a vessel-bowl sink, and a frosted glass wall to let in light from the bedroom. Very favourable first impression. The down side of this modernization is that the room lost functionality. The closet space was taken up by the ironing board, in-room safe and folding luggage rack. Apart from leaving a suitcase on a folding rack, there were only small cube boxes in the tv wall unit where one could put small personal items. So suitcases stayed out in the room, holding clothes. The pocket door to the bathroom would not stay open, had no noise-reducing rubber or felt so it banged shut every time someone used the bathroom. The glass wall meant the towel rack was missing in the bathroom -- the one small hook could hold but one towel or two face cloths.

I stayed at the Hyatt Regency with 1 friend in October 2010, we got a great deal on a room via Priceline and were excited to stay there. The hotel is situated right on King St. in the entertainment district, within walking distance to the great theaters, restaurants and nightlife that Toronto has to offer. The hotel is very beautiful and modern, with sleek television displays and very contemporary designed, although small-in-size rooms. The problems began at check-in. Upon going over my reservation the snooty receptionist noticed that the room had been booked on Priceline, and after muttering \"Priceline, of course\" under his breath told me that I was not able to request a room with 2 double beds instead of 1 king since they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so busy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but for an additional $75 charge they could upgrade me to a room with double beds. I remembered looking on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website before arrival and seeing that the price of room with either 2 doubles or 1 king is identical. I let it slide and my friend and I stuck with the 1 king bed. I then enquired about underground parking and was told there were no in-and-out privileges, so that every time we left we would have to pay another $24 to get back in?? This did not make sense at all, so I went down to the parking docks and talked to attendant down there who accurately told me that the pass was good for the entire 24 hours and I could come and go as pleased. Other than the rudeness of the front desk clerk and the fact that we were placed on the so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Priceline party floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (where the hotel thinks it is ok to allow noise and music blast until 4:30am, even with me calling down from our room 3 times and was told that the noise problem would be resolved), my stay at the Hyatt Regency was average.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a pretentious traveller, but when i go to a Hyatt, I expect a certain standard and this hotel just didn't have that.

However, we arrived and were warmly greeted by the doorman, and everyone else working there was also friendly and helpful.

The pillows and comforter were thick and soft, and though the room was on the small side, it was really cozy. I was so pleased that I ended up spending most of the day relaxing in the room since I've been to Toronto many times and didn't feel the need to do any sightseeing.

Firstly, I am not entirely sure what this \"Regency\" brand is trying to project to its customers. Is it a mid range hotel? Are they trying to be just a step down from the Park Hyatt's? To me it seems like an equivalent to a newer Holiday Inn or Hilton Garden Inn. There definitely seems to be a disconnect from planned to actual (on the value proposition). First the good: the location is excellent. King Street West is full of great places to eat, shop and for me close to work. You also have a pharmacy just across the street which is convenient. The fitness centre is well equipped and the roof top area is nice offering an amazing view of the area. There are lots of lounge chairs to relax in. Also a nice place to go for a swim. The beds were very comfortable, and the flatscreen TV was new and probably the largest I have seen in a hotel room! The staff are for the most part friendly and service oriented. Now the areas for improvement. This is my biggest issue with this hotel: during both my stays which were weeks apart, 2 of the 4 elevators were not working. This often created a long wait in the morning and was very annoying. When the elevator did arrive you are packed in there with too many other guests. Not ideal for anyone claustrophobic! While the room looked somewhat renovated the cheap furniture does not appear new. The white leather club chair was so soiled you would not want to sit in it! Note to the designer, gray, black or brown chairs are better for commercial applications. The bathroom vanity is very small and the vessel type sink is not at all practical. The red lacquer look gives the room an eighties feel. I did not find the bathroom clean at all. Where the wall meets the bottom of the bathtub there was a lot of grime and hair built up which is not up to a 4 star hotel cleanliness standard. The ceiling has a few spots of what looked like water damage that needed repair. The food and beverage is extremely overpriced. $14 for a glass of mediocre Italian red wine at the bar is pushing it! Some mornings I was awoken to construction above me and the sound of a hammer and drill. I think 7 am is much too early for this type of annoyance.There were noticeable staffing issues including 10 people queuing to check in to one frazzled agent who was also dealing the best he could to phone lines ringing. I did not like having to buy an Internet card for minutes in the business centre so passed on that added expense. Free internet is the norm at hotels and motels in Canada nowadays. This hotel is at best a 3.5 star. Recommendations to management: get your elevator maintenance repairs complete pronto, pay more attention to your cleanliness standards and offer free internet.

I feel bad about writing this because our house keepers and the front desk agent, Sam are very nice, helpful and well meaning. I stay in a Hyatt Regency 95% of the year, so I am pretty accustomed to the Hyatt properties in my travels but this is the first time I've experienced bed bugs and I find it gross and FREAKING ITCHY. I attending a wedding last night and spend most of it itching myself. ugh. annoying. Upon reporting the bugs, the front desk Manager, Kristine was very professional and offered to run and get itch cream and even another room. I appreciate that and she was very well meaning but apparently according to Hyatt policy they have to send exterminators in first to do anything in terms of resolving customer satisfaction. (comp night, discount, etc.) but I guess the bottom line is, even if it was a free night stay, it doesn't change my memory of the stay, which is leading me to write this review. Overall the hotel is meh, nothing special and upon doing some research I found that this property was actually a holiday inn or something budget before becoming a Hyatt, which leads me to my next point. Of the Hyatt properties I've stayed at I would find this one on the bottom tier. Hotel Vibe. It's a party hotel, full of party patrons. I get it. I am in my 20s, I do that too. but they should at least make this hotel an Andaz property then and not try to hide that its something else. Lobby was full of the typical party DB types, dudes not wearing shirts, drunk party girls, etc. Maybe if I was in vegas or hollywood I won't care - but we were here for a wedding and I was taking care of my parents. They weren't too happy about it. Facilities, Nothing special, Gym is your typical Hyatt Stay Fit gym. Pool seems like it has a cool view and they have a sauna. Parking is super expensive but that's typical of a downtown hotel. I wish they posted it... hate how those fees always seem to spring up on ya. Food Room service is good. room service food is bad. I came in late on Thursday night and got a pretty cold sandwich with cold fries. There is no regency club so they offer breakfast buffet. reminded me of Hampton in quality food. runny eggs, plain sausages. Back to bed bugs. So - the hotel management response has been on par so far. they've photographed my bug bites, offering to inspect the room, rand and consulted a pharisist to buy hydrocortizone and even offered to adjust the room. Again... all very well meaning and Kristene the front desk manager is doing a good job at trying to help resolve it... but still doesnt change the fact that I got all these bites. I am just a very experienced Hyatt customer who is very disappointed on my stay. The staff and manager mean well... but the i am left with an Itchy feeling. Just feeling a gap on justice.

The bath towels were large enough to be beach towels. We ate at both restaurants and the food was excellent. They have Starbucks beside the lobby that we got coffee from and I spent some time there with their free internet access. The only recommendations I would make to them to make it absolutely the best would be the make the internet access free. Many hotels include it in the rate, but many of the higher end hotels usually charge for it. The only other thing was that one day their was a labor strike and we had no maid service that day. Hotel management offered free breakfast that day with free hors d'oeuvres during a cocktail hour that evening, so it was a nice gesture.

Also, they should probably not have gone for white furnature that cant be cleaned. The beds were comfortable though which was great! And most important! It was also quiet.

There is a Starbucks in the lobby for a quick coffee and breakfast in the mornings. The pleasant surprise we had was the outdoor pool on the 17th floor. After 2 days of non-stop running around, we were so happy to come back to the hotel on our last afternoon and go to the pool.

Even though there were quite a few families at the pool, there is a 2 level outdoor deck, so there was plenty of comfortable seating. The pool isn't deep, but it was just fine to cool off and pass some time. On the weekends they have drink service. The only downside was the size of the rooms. It's like being in a New York City hotel room. There isn't much room to walk around. The bathroom was very small with virtually no counterspace. In the bedroom, there were 3 tiny draws in which you could dump some socks and underwear, and the closet had about 4 hangers in it. For a family of four, it was tough living out of our suitcase for 3 days. The staff was very nice. Parking is expensive ($25 a night), but attached to the hotel. You can park in a few spaces right outside the lobby for check-in, and then move your car to the garage. It was convenient. I would recommend the hotel for its location.

As always, I booked this room on Priceline, and got it for 70$ a night US. Most of the times that I have stayed in Toronto, and used either priceline or hotwire, I have stayed at the other great hotels closer to Young St, such as the Hilton, and the Sheraton center. This was my first time staying so far West in The downtown Core, and We loved it. The hotel itself is hard to miss due to it unique structure. Parking was very easy to find, as you simply follow the signs on the east side of the building. Be prepared to pay over 20$ a night though, but it does allow you full in and out priviliges. Check in was very quick, and the service was great. The lobby is very modern and clean. Our room was on the 7th floor, and we were very pleased with it. The rooms also follow the lobby, in which the style is very modern. There is a huge flat screen TV build into the curved walls, and the King sized bed is probably THE MOST COMFORTABLE bed we have ever slept in. The room is a 5/5 for sure in my opinion The location of this Hotel is what made us very happy, as we were only a 5 minute walk to the theatres, and directly across the street from some great unique restaurants and bistros. We also were a 10 minute walk to the Roger's centre, where we got great seats for the game off a scalper. There is also great shopping one major street up on Queen's Street, which you can follow right up to the eaton center and young street. The pool is located on the 12 th floor ( I think) and is outdoors. The view from the pool is very nice, and was a ncie break from walking around the city all day. Depending on occupancy, I could see the pool being very busy on hot summer days. For this reason, I was kinda wishing they had something like the Delta Chelsea adult only pool. We took a look into the gym, and saw that they had great modern equipment, and a beautiful view for those looking to break a sweat. What else can I say.. Great location, Great service..

I got to the hotel on the Airport Shuttle, and was dropped off on the street with no hotel sign to be seen - the driver just said \"Hyatt drop off\" and tossed me my suitcases. It would have been helpful if he'd said that the hotel entrance was around the corner and a half block down the street. (I realize that's an issue with the shuttle, not the hotel) There are two entrances to the hotel. One where the driveway is, which is on the same level as the lobby and has automatic doors. The bellmen are stationed here to assist with bags. ...and then the entrance closest to the Shuttle drop off and the taxi line which has two sets of doors and two small flights of steps - and nobody to help hold the doors or carry your luggage up the stairs. I lugged heavy bags (with obvious difficulty) up and down those stairs in full view of the front desk and bell desk three times over my stay and nobody offered any assistance. Whoever decided that entrance didn't require any staff assistance is nuts. There is absolutely no free wifi in the hotel. You even have to pay to use the computer in the business centre. I stay at a lot of hotels and it's been a long time since i've been in one that doesn't offer any free computing anywhere. Luckily the desk staff were kind enough to allow my partner to use one of their computers for a couple of minutes. The room itself was nice albeit small - very space age and slick and efficiently designed. I appreciated the stylishly designed drawers and cupboards as I prefer to unpack my suitcase for hotel stays. Rooms are equipped with a nice 42\" flat screen. I found it odd that the sheet over the mattress was just a flat sheet pulled over the bed - it wasn't long enough to tuck underneath, and bunched up badly as we slept and moved around in bed. Not sure why a fitted sheet wasn't used. Unfortunately it appears that the housekeeping department is not very thorough as I found three pieces of broken glass on the floor, a sticker from a previous guest's purchased clothing on the wall, and chewing gum stuck to the window frame between the bathroom and the room. There were also two lightbulbs burned out in the room. I mentioned the state of the room to the front desk and was told that they would request a thorough cleaning. This did not happen. (they did comp my partner's parking on check-out as an apology, for which I am thankful, but that doesn't stop the fact that housekeeping was poor.) The staff at the front desk and bell desk were pleasant and helpful when I had questions. It was disappointing that room service in what is supposedly a 4 star hotel cuts off at 11pm. I was in TO to attend a performance festival and returned to the room around 1am absolutely famished, with only a couple of delivery options (pizza) available. The fire alarm went off at 5:15am on the Friday night of the stay. I understand that these things happen, and politely trudged down 16 flights of stairs to sit outside on the pavement for 1/2 hour while the fire department determined that it was a false alarm. ...However the volume of the alarm is kept at EARBLEED level and I ended up with a splitting headache that made further sleep difficult, and took much of the next day to get rid of. We didn't end up doing any of the things we'd planned that day. The alarm was physically painful to listen to and I had noticeable ringing in my ears afterwards.

We have stayed at several downtown TO hotels and this was by far the best experience we have had. We have stayed in some very small rooms and some very dirty rooms, this was neither. We booked through Priceline and got a fantastic rate (more than 50% off the rate on the Hyatt website). We did the bid system so we didn't know what hotel we were getting until after we paid and I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews but all I can say is that some people may be a bit too picky or have no experience staying in Toronto because we found this hotel fabulous! When we checked in, we found out we were booked for a double room - I nicely asked if they had any King rooms available and without hesitation we were upgraded for free. We were given a room on the 11th floor, looking directly at the CN Tower. We had one of the rooms with the rounded windows (you can see them next to the Hyatt sign if you look at a picture of the hotel). That was a nice touch as well since I have seen the pictures of the rooms with the flat walls and they look smaller (which is still a good size for a Toronto hotel). We loved the decor - completely our style. Maybe modern-chic is not for everyone but I'd have to say that it was very clean and in the end that's what matters most. The staff was fantastic. We only had 1 pack of caffinated coffee in the room so I called the front desk and within 10 minutes someone had brought us more. The beds were extremely comfortable - plush pillow-top mattress. It was actually a King mattress, not two doubles pushed together which is definitely a nice change from what some other TO hotels offer. We had 5 pillows in the room which to me is plenty - not sure why anyone would need more than 5. I also noticed the gap others had mentioned between the mattress and the headboard. It's not an open gap, it's solid, we propped our pillows on it and sat up fine to watch tv. We didn't even notice it when we slept. We put out the room service card for breakfast and it was promptly delivered at the time we requested. Compared to room service rates at other hotels and the quality of food, it was a fantastic breakfast. Checkout was very quick and hassle free. When my husband got the car from the parking garage, there was a ticket on it and the hotel apologized immediately and voided the ticket. Not something I'm going to get angry at since it's another company who administers the tickets and they obviously weren't using an updated list of hotel guests. A couple other guests got them as well but no one seemed upset about it since the hotel handled it very professionally and quickly, without question. We will absolutely stay there again and would even be willing to pay full price to ensure we get the same hotel. Oh and I just wanted to add, we were never asked to sign any sort of form about the 10pm noise policy.

It was recommended to me and we were not disappointed. We would love to return during the warmer months as the rooftop patio/pool would be fun. To me at least it has a unique, sophisticated feel of a boutique hotel and urban residential building hybrid which we found very welcoming. I could not disagree more about some of the negative tripadvisor comments about the look and atmosphere, and never had a single elevator issue. There is a small sign indicating work to improve elevator service will be completed soon; the hotel is hiding nothing that way. We were on the 15th floor with a spectacular view of the CN Tower, which for those that don't know, is quite a light show at night! OK, our room (two double beds) wasn't huge, but more than adequate for two, and we really liked the simple decor. Lots of dark wood, cool, well-designed white lacquered storage units with pomegranate coloured accents, and a compact but very nice marble and granite bathroom, with a (privacy) glass door and wall window which let in natural light, something I have never seen in a hotel room. The room itself and bathroom were spotless and the toiletries good quality and plentiful. The beds (with feather pillows and a great duvets) were super comfortable; combined with the very quiet atmosphere, this hotel certainly offers a good night's sleep. We enjoyed the big flat screen TV and iPod dock also. The location is good, a short walk from the train station in good weather (likely easy also from the underground (Path?) system regardless). If you looking for nightlife, you're in the right district as it literally is in the Entertainment District. Second City Comedy Club is steps away--check out their Monday night deals. We were there to shop, so didn't go there this time, maybe next. Of course this Hyatt is also right near live theatre and many restaurants, pubs and bars. I was told by the (unobtrusive, yet friendly and helpful!) desk staff that the Toronto Film Festival will soon be hosted from their new venue, also very nearby, by 2011. This Hyatt will fill up at that time to be sure--likely a great spot for celebrity spotting IF you can get a room that week! I was warned to book far ahead. It's a close walk to Queen Street shopping and other shopping, museums, and other activities are a close drive, streetcar, subway or taxi away. We didn't dine at either restaurant, so can't comment on those, they looked very chic however, and I saw several comfortable looking patrons drinking wine at the brand new--it opened the day we arrived--ground level bar (actually a bit above ground, the restaurant \"downstairs\" is actually steet level with what would likely be good people watching.) I should mention here that the lobby and the two restaurants were all very well-designed and appointed in our opinions, with a retro but trendy feel. There is a water feature in the lobby flanked by amazing huge sofas, great for hanging out while you decide what to do for the day--much too much choice in Toronto if there is such a thing--NOTE: do not miss the Distillery District, worth the visit. There is a multi-level Starbucks right off of the lobby and a Cora's a few blocks away, both great for breakfasts. No. 99 (Wayne Gretzky's restaurant) is also just around the corner for hockey fans. I would recommend this hotel to anyone except those who feel they need the use of a pool during a winter stay. We saw people of all ages, business and leisure travellers alike staying at this Hyatt.

Also, being a Saturday night, the hotel seemed to be full of young people who come to Toronto for the nightlife and because they can't drive home, book rooms out and were a little noisy coming and going.

The hotel itself is very non-descript from the outside. It has no real entrance. There are two glass doors off of King St and a drive up entrance off a side street. Front desk staff were very friendly despite the fact I had requested and early check in when I booked and nothing was availble when we arrived, although two parties ahead of us were checked in. A little annoying, but not major. I was there with my husband and two kids 12 and 10 yrs. We had a double room on the 10th floor. The room is VERY small. The decor is exactly how you see in the pictures from other reviews. I understand what they were going for, but it just seemed to fall short. The room was clean and the flat screen tv (42\"?) was nice. The bathroom was probably the smallest bathroom I have ever encountered travelling. It looked very cool with the bowl sink and frosted door, but there was barely room to turn around and no counter space to put toiletries. Pool and lounge area on the 17th floor is nice. Has a great view of the city and is quite large. As others have said, this hotel was full of young 20 somethings downtown to party for the night as it is located in the entertainment district. We didn't have any problems with this except for hearing them stagger in. The hotel is in a great location for restaurants, shopping,and sports events (no need to get the car out). If it were just my husband and I, and we could get a larger room ,I'd probably give the Hyatt another try. With the kids, I'll stick to the Sheraton.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "catmad96", "ReviewID": "UR37691029", "Content": "I was quite surprised by some of the reviews - we both thought that the Hyatt was brilliant.

But, the hallways are so dimly lit that they are a little seedy looking, the elevators were filthy, and although the furnishings/room were brand new, the furnishings were chipped, the sliding door to the bathroom was covered in hand prints, and the place is showing signs of lack of upkeep. I don't expect things will look so hip in another year or two at this rate. But my real issue is with the price gauging. Internet in your room? 15$ a day. Come on! Even the roadside motels chains have free interent! Parking? 25$ a day- not bad for Toronto- except the parking garage has a sign- SPECIAL 10.95! So if you pay in the garage, 10.95. If you tell the hotel yoo parked there- added to your bill- 25$. And did I mention the bottle of water in your room. A generic, 500ml bottle of warn water- with a $4.00 sticker on it (on this same trip I stayed at a Four Points by Sheraton- which had the same bottle of water in the room with a sticker that read- \"It's water- of course it's free\").

Still, we had to sign.

The room was too small for the bed - Hyatt's introducing their mega-beds into all their hotels, which is fine, but the room wasn't designed for it. So there was a bed big enough for three families to live in, but less than 1 foot (20cm) clearance from the foot of the bed to the closet, and if you opened the door to the room you blocked that space! Very silly. On the bright side, the staff are clearly pumped to be working for Hyatt rather than their previous chain, so service was enthusiastic. And the room facilities were fine, tea/coffee maker, good bathroom, etc. Otherwise the hotel's probably ok. On the first night, however.... The internet didn't work properly, and the IT support was clearly clutching at straws in trying to fix it. I gave up, and hijacked a connection at my various business meetings. There was no restaurant \"just order room service for breakfast\". On the second day I did, and it didn't turn up, despite a reminder. On the first day (having checked in late the previous evening) I had to postpone my breakfast business meeting hurriedly! The lobby was a dust bowl as the contractors were still doing their stuff. The housekeeping staff still hadn't finished the room by 5pm despite me being out all day (and were negotiating with each vocally down the corridors to locate soap, towels, coffee, etc!). Generally it was glorious chaos. I'm sure that'll fix, and, as I say, the staff were clearly motivated. But I've made a mental note to myself never to be a hotel guinea pig again. It made for some entertaining stories to tell, but added some unneeded inconvenience to my business schedule.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cLove Pets??
