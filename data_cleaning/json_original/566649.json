{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Still needs a kick up the backside Wonderful peaceful setting, fabulous views from the room, which was comfortable and clean. However, the bar was also being used as a conference area, with a couple of settees to one side. No bar staff available, you had to call someone from reception who, happily for us, had no idea of how to serve drinks - so all drinks came as doubles! The restaurant had no atmosphre at all. The food quality ranged from average to appalling. Cold potatoes and vegetables (no heat lamps or candles used to keep the food warm), no deserts, very average dinner. Breakfast - stale bread, some jams, coffee from a machine. Not enough tables for the guests. Not even a toaster, and no-one available to toast the gluten-free bread I had taken with me. Second morning boiled eggs were on offer. An effort was made to toast the bread, but basically permission had to be given to the waitress to use the OVEN, so the bread got baked. There were tinned peaches on offer. With some care and attention to detail, and some more staff to look after the guests, this place should be a splendid place to stay. The staff were friendly and seemed to be trying their best, but some professional training is sorely needed. I am amazed they are still in business!", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR566855446", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CoeliacSussex"}, {"Content": "Disappointed My travel companion and I had booked this hotel through a travel agent because of the web site. It looked fantastic and had what we wanted in our hotel. The spa sounded great and the shuttle to Florence was going to work out perfectly for our stay. We arrived to find out there was no spa as we know it and that the shuttle had been discontinued.(there was a laminated card on the bedside table stating there was a transit service - thinking maybe there was a language misunderstanding - we took the card to the front desk and were told that it was no longer avaiable) We were told to rent a car - which neither one of us wanted to be responsible for - or take a cab each way into Florence - 40 Euros each way! ($60 Cdn). We were also told the restaurant was not going to be open for dinners. Fortunately, the day we arrived we were able to eat in the dining room as they had a conference at the hotel. We contacted our travel agent and were moved into Florence for the rest of our stay. If you want to be isolated and love to drive the small roads (our driver got lost 3 times on the way to the hotel) then this is the place for you. It is located in the hills and it is very scenic. I'm sure for some this place would be lovely but if you want to spend some time in Florence without the worry of a car, this was not the place.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR139267454", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TravelgalWinnipeg_Mb"}, {"Content": "Loaction 4XXXX service  Booked Tuscany tour through Citalia  the Hotel looked great in Brochure. We spent 4 nights in this hotel. The rooms were fine  the rear grounds were quite pleasent although pool was not ready to be used. Generally the Hotel appeared to be short of staff. Also on arrival at 2.00pm unable to get snack to tied us over until evening meal. Very disappointed with the Evening meals, being self-service  buffet style,  normally cold. Breakfast was adequate.Had to go Hunting for barperson for evening drinks.

My husband and I spent three nights here last week. Although it looked lovely in the Citalia brochure and was quoted as a 4 star Select property, we felt it needed, for want of a better description 'a kick up the backside'!On arrival, we were not offered porter assistance or even pointed out the luggage trolleys which we realised the next day were available. (Obviously, there was no porter to help with luggage as the next morning, we saw an elderly couple struggling with their own luggage to their car.) Our room was clean and reasonably comfortable with a nice marble-tiled separate WC and bathroom. It was also a nice, peaceful location.However, our main complaint was the standard in the dining room. We were on a bed and breakfast rate and were amazed the first morning we came down for breakfast to find that all the tables had had previous guests sitting at them and the tables had just been re-set with paper napkins and cutlery on top of the dirty tablecoth! All the tablecloths had crumbs, butter, some with runny egg spilt on them and this was the same each morning. The food offered for breakfast was very ordinary and several guests commented on the bruised, old, over-ripe fresh fruit on offer. Frequently the croissants and bread (usually a good 2 or 3 days old) had run out and was not replaced for some time. Needless to say, we did not bother to eat there in the evening. The only redeeming feature was that there was a brilliant restaurant in the town of Marciole only 2 minutes away by car which served well-cooked, very fresh, local produce.The only really complimentary thing we could say about the Sorgente Roveta was that one of the mornings of our stay, there was very pleasant, young gentleman on the reception desk who was very obliging, friendly and helpful.", "Date": "Oct 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR211810991", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Couldn't have chosen better!
