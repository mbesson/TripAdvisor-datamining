First of all, the customer service is appalling. People at the desk don't know what they're doing, many of them are nice and you can tell they're making an effort, but they are really not well trained and instructed. Customer service is something you would expect from a 4* hotel. The rooms are very average, trying to be fancy and cool with really tacky and average decor. My room had the heating on at full power and it was impossible to turn it down: I had to open the windows to avoid melting, which resulted in a horrible sore throat the next day. Brilliant. Not to mention the noises coming from the street which woke me up at 5am. The next night I ordered room service, a \"4 formaggi\" (4 cheeses) pizza and a chocolate pannacotta. The pizza was nothing short of awful: 4 cheeses were two, a very dry mozzarella and CREAM CHEESE ! ! ! ! ! cream cheese, on a pizza, in Italy! I was outraged. I spent \u20ac15 on it, and they even got the wrong kind of pizza the first time round, so I had to wait a total of 1hour and 15 minutes to have my (disappointing) dinner. The pannacotta was really bad as well, a weird texture to it and no flavour at all.

The hotel looks nice & outfitting of the the halls & rooms are antique and beautiful. One of the few hotels that i found that offers king bed for a single occupancy. She didn't want a single bed. Her room had silk on walls & nice furniture, pleasant to be in. The toilet had a shower & nice size. Wifi is free in the whole hotel however the room had a poor signal. Guess this depends on the floor is how far your room is.... Breakfast was fairly ok. Hotel has also a restaurant that is a popular spot& always busy. Staff was helpful & friendly.

The elevator is perhaps the smallest and the narrowest in the world! Just like the shower cabin is, having even no soap holder. If you are unlucky to drop the soap while taking shower, then... well, no way to take it back unless you stop taking shower and get out of the cabin! The bathroom has no (and I mean NO) place to put your necessities like toothbrush, shaver, etc... During early morning breakfast hour the staff may open the door to the street and starting bringing merchandise without even caring to apologize for discomfort and the cold they bring in to hotel guests having breakfast at that time.

Pizza was tasteless and hard, mushrooms on it were soggy! A simple mixed green salad was not edible. Then came the pasta, simple pomodoro pasta that was a complete embarrassment to any Italian.

The writing was on the wall really as it took two frantic waitresses 15 minutes to even acknowledge that we would possibly like a menu / drink, ( it wasn't actually very busy either !), but we stuck with it as the setting of narrow cobbled streets etc was lovely and we weren't in any major hurry. I'm going to try to cut a very long episode of events short, as what happened in the next hour and a half (!) was comical up to the point I actually got to see the manager to complain. It was plainly obvious ( and quite amusing ) that the two waitresses were totally incapable of fetching a few bland plates of over priced pasta / rissotto / pizzas to customers tables. A couple, who sat next to us, waited an hour for their 'meals' to be served and when they asked where their food was, they were told that they ( the waitresses ) had forgotten about them !!! and they had to wait a further 15 minutes ! During part of this waiting game, we also had to endure two male colleagues, ( what I could only guess were 'management' as they were doing alot of watching of the incompetent waitresses, without offering to help ! ), change a propane gas cylinder in a patio heater for about 10 minutes, les than 2-3 feet from where my wife was sitting, without offering any 'excuse me madams'....unbelievable ignorance!! Anyway....eventually, nearly TWO hours later, without being offered a dessert menu / another drink etc in all this time, we asked for the bill. The waitress came back and started to ask US what we had eaten / drank !! At which point I asked to see the manager, which was met with her throwing a bit of a tantrum and saying \"I knew you were going to complain!!\" She then told me I would have to go and find the manager as he was very busy! I then demanded to see the manager as we weren't prepared to settle the bill in full. In short one of the 'managers' came out about 5 mins later and we were virtually told that it was too bad, as they were having building work done and it wasn't a \"fast food complex\" !! No offer of any reduction or apology by him or anyone else, and we were eventually told to pay in full or he would call the police!! In summing up, this has got to be the WORST service I have ever received at a restaurant and would not recommend anyone to eat here, unless you want what we received... a poor expensive plate of 'food' with disgraceful disregard for customer service and extreme rudeness to boot! it ruined what should have been a pleasant evening for both of us!
