It was easy to find on Robson St (despite the road work being done further up Robson). We got a great parking spot right in front of check in and best of all, the parking spot was FREE. Free!!! That's a good value in a fairly expensive city. We were able to check right and get our room key to suite 1001- the first suite on the 10th floor. This faced Robson St which was a blessing and a curse- as I will explain. You enter into a hallway and on the left is a small bathroom and bedroom and to the right, a living room and kitchen. It's a smallish apartment and perfect for 2 people, or a family, for an extended stay. There is a precariously small balcony facing Robson that we barely dared to step out on (it was only about 2 feet deep) but the views were great- you could see all the way to Stanley Park and the mountains beyond. Since it was August, it was warm, about 80 degrees (F) and so we opened every window since there is no A/C, but there was a ceiling fan in the living room. This is where the problem of facing Robson came to play. The location on Robson St is great- lots of bars and restaurants and shopping, etc. But it bustles every night, ALL night. We could hear cars and people until 3 am or later. Busses that stopped across the street were extremely loud and ran very late and then very early and even on the 10th floor, because all the windows were open, we could hear lots of noise all the time. So, the location is the tradeoff, but fair warning. The bedroom had a queen bed and 2 dressers and a clothes bar (not closet) and that was literally it. Very sparsely furnished and shabby, old furnishings at that- but clean. I must emphasize that it was clean. The bathroom was also clean but small, and the towels weren't great but everything worked fine. The bathroom came with dishes, utensils, coffeemaker, a fridge and stove- great! The coffee supplies were refilled every day and the fridge came in handy. The TV got lots of channels so there was always something to watch. This is the kind of place to stay if you want to feel like you are living in a city rather than just a guest in a hotel. We had a decent stay, nothing spectacular. The rooms could do with an overhaul of paint and carpet and furniture for sure. It's not for the fussy or picky but completely fine and functional if you go into it knowing that Vancouver is an expensive city and for $129 (CAD) we got a bargain.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "irvine", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "gablor", "ReviewID": "UR38711227", "Content": "Like other previous reviewers we really liked the location.

Fortunately the weather was warm and we did not need any heating, but we had to boil the kettle to get hot water for washing and the plug in the wash basin did not stay in place, so washing was rather tricky. Unfortunately, no representative from the hotel advised us of the problem, let alone apologized for the situation; we had to ask when the boiler would be repaired. On checking out, we had to ask for a discount for the inconvenience and we did negotiate one, but we did have to ask. The gentleman who agreed this discount explained that boilers could break down at any time and still did not apologize.

I was originally booked at the Blue Horizon Hotel up the road (at CDN 110 a night) and was extending my stay so wanted a place that was a little cheaper. The Tropicana had availability for about CDN 80 a night and I inspected a suite on the top floor (12th floor). The building is old but the suite was clean enough with a separate bathroom of a decent size (and more importantly no mould lurking in the corners of the bath / shower), the bed seemed comfortable and the kitchen area serviceable. My only gripe was that the TV was in a separate living area (with a couch) and not in the bedroom. I was travelling by myself and did not require a lot of room, however I can see how a more traditional apartment arrangement would benefit couples or families as there was heaps of room and storage. The suite also seemed quite bright. Anyway, I went back the next morning to book this suite but was told that the building had no hot water or heating!!! I asked when this was expected to be fixed and the gentleman at the front desk could not tell me when. I said that I was intending to book the suite for a week but this was probably not a good time to do so and he also agreed. For CDN 40 more a night, I ended up extending my stay at the Blue Horizon (this is a fantastic hotel and was totally worth the extra bucks!) Incidentally, when I was inspecting the suite, there was also a lift technician visiting the building. Apparently one of the two lifts had stopped working. My advice to those wishing to book a place in this hotel is to have something in writing from the management, saying that if the hot water system / heating system etc does not work for more than 10 hours (or whatever your tolerance level is), you have the right to terminate your stay, receive a refund for any accommodation paid upfront or a discount for the remainder of your stay.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, plenty of space\u201d", "Author": "KuruK", "ReviewID": "UR11104227", "Content": "This hotel is situated in the \"buffer zone\" between downtown and the West End.

The room was simple, and a little run down, but huge. We had a good sized bedroom, with a nice closet. A living room with coffee table, sitting table, couch, and view. Also a kitchen.

The location, in the heart of the Robson street area, can't be beat. Close to Stanley Park, restaurants, everything! There is no air conditioning, but this was never a problem, as there was a good breeze. The only downside was road and people noise from below. We were on the 6th floor, but it would be nice to be higher. Oh, free parking!!! Let me say that again....Free Parking!!!

This was after phoning a dozen other places that could not accomodate us. Well the old saying \"you get what you pay for\" holds true with this joint, no wait a minute, the Tropicana actually gives you less. It's a dumper; theres no better description. Stepping off the elevator into a dimily lit narrow corridor with surface mounted conduits on the ceiling said \"turn around\". Entering the poorly ventilated, sparsely decorated room said\"get out quick\". This place is shabby, rundown and would be too much money at half the price and it's cheap to begin with. The bathroom door would not close as it had been kicked in and broken, there were no towel bars, and the toilet paper was a half used roll sitting on the toilet tank as there was no paper holder. There was a single miniscule bar of soap and a previously used bottle of shampoo, two tiny bath towels, a single hand towel and nothing else. My wife called housekeeping to ask for face cloths and was informed that they had run out!! The 1960's kitchen was another award winner and made us cringe at the thought of someone actually using the dirty utensils and garage sale smallwares provided. The bedroom was the only redeeming feature and had a clean, comfortable bed so we decided to stick it out for the night and got the heck out of there first thing in the morning.

I am a 22 year old male and my girlfriend is 19. We are both students who decided to travel across the west coast. Our travels included Banff, Lake Louise, Kelowna, Vancouver, and North Battleford(haha childhood memories). Feel free to check out my other reviews of hotels we stayed in. Now for the review: First, let me say that this does have a great location on Robson street and the price is very nice. However, this does not make up for a few BIG problems with this hotel! Let me tell you the biggest problem first: NO AIR CONDITIONING!!! When this first came to my attention from the front desk staff I was a tad shoked to hear that a hotel in Vancouver didn't have a common hotel amenity such as air conditioning. Needless to say coming in from +30 degree tempurature our ovenlike hotel suite was less than tolerable. And let me tell you, sleeping was even less tolerable! Another problem we had started after we arrived in the room. Usually after a long trip from Kelowna to Vancouver, one would have to go to the bathroom or have a quick shower to freshen up before a night out on the town. This however was not possible BECAUSE THE WATER DIDN'T WORK!!! Now, we figured this was not such a big deal since we wouldn't be in the room all day anyways really so we just left this small annoyance behind us. One thing we wanted to check out was the pool though(even though we were pretty sure it wasn't running). We were sharing the elevator with two of the \"competent\" maids(LONGEST wait for an elevator I've ever had...and we were only on the 8th floor) and asked if the pool was open. One of the maids abruptly answered, \"No\". When we asked if we could just see it we recieved a \"No\" aswell. The maids were quite rude. The front desk staff was polite but I wouldn't say nice or anything remotely close to hospitable. I could probably go on for a while about how much we hated this hotel but I will say that we didn't end up staying for the rest of the planned 3 nights. Good riddance Tropicana Inn. We might go back to Vancouver but I guarantee you that we will not return to this hotel. So, in conclusion, if your idea of a good hotel is one without air conditioning, rude staff, a small parking lot, no alarm clocks, plain looking decor and much more garbage, then by all means, stay here!", "Date": "June 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, MB, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal-Would Return\u201d", "Author": "Novaya", "ReviewID": "UR3289056", "Content": "This was an excellent choice for our 7 night stay in Vancouver- (Oct2004)-- The location could NOT be beat- it was right on Robson where all the action was- just minutes from restaurants and shopping. We could walk or bus wherever we needed extremely easily. The room was not brand spanking new- but the washroom, and the beds were all very clean. And the sizes or their room were very generous- had a separate bedroom, a kitchenette, sitting room and a good size bathroom with a tub. And the price was extrememly reasonable- just around $110 a night for 3 people which is definitely less than the hotels etc in the same vicinity. There weren't a lot of extra amenities (ie. no breakfast), but there was a small basement pool, elevators, competent maid service, and good views (we had a room facing the back and could see a sliver of water from Stanley park).

Actually, it was a mini-suite with a kitchen and a seperate bedroom! It was clean, comfortable, and secure. It had a great view of Robson Street, and was right in the heart of the shopping district. The drive to Stanley Park only took 10 minutes, and that was during rush hour traffic! If need be, you could walk to the park, as it is only about a mile away. The hotel provides onsite and overflow parking for no extra charge. There was no room service available, but the place is surrounded by good restaurants, and food delivery is available. With the kitchen, you can even keep your leftovers for the next day! If you like Chinese food, be sure to check out the restaurant on the same side of the street just a few doors down. The food is great, and a very good deal. The waterfront is only several blocks away, too.
