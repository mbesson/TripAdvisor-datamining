They allowed us to store my daughter's wheelchair in a very convenient place and helped us to make our way to the lift. The hotel itself is very attractively decorated, and despite being New Year's Eve, very peaceful. Everywhere was clean, warm and very comfortable. Our room was extremely nice. Twin beds with neat attractive covers. Ample storage space is provided, along with the very necessary kettle and tea/coffee making requirements. Often we are rather disappointed with bathrooms in hotels, but this was an absolutely lovely one. Clean, warm and bright with both bath and shower! The water ran hot at all times and we were both able to have a bath during the afternoon, and showers when we returned from the incredible firework displays on the Thames. Lovely fresh, soft towels and tiny soaps and shower gels were provided, and the toilet was not only spotless, but had a paper cover over it. The view was lovely, at the back we looked over the tops of the buildings to the awesome skyline of london. In the front you would have lovely views of the square, and its gardens. We slept perfectly and in the morning went downstairs to sample the breakfast. The room was a little bare, but clean and tidy. The food was really good, and our waitress was helpful. It would be nice if the room were more attractive but we could not fault the service. The position of the hotel is so convenient for transport with stations around the corner, bus stops only five minutes from the door, and plenty of good eating places and entertainment only a road or two away. We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already re-booked for the Queen's Jubilee weekend, and intend to use this hotel again and again. The only downside that we experienced was the steps at the front and the lack of a disabled entrance. This was, however, a small price to pay for such a lovely hotel, a really perfect base for your London holiday!", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "laurie t", "ReviewID": "UR125185412", "Content": "stayed here for 4 nights reception very helpfull,room clean and tidy tea & coffee great shower room 2 minute walk from tube station choice of full english or continental breakfast great budget hotel would stay again", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sisi, Crete", "Title": "\u201cNice and clean\u201d", "Author": "Stefanos81", "ReviewID": "UR124258690", "Content": "If you are looking for a nice, basic and clean room then Chrysos is what you looking for. 2 minutes walk from paddington station!", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cYou Get What You Pay For.\u201d", "Author": "marcuslikus", "ReviewID": "UR123265788", "Content": "I used airline miles for my stay.

Coffee was really bad and we should have taken our bodum (which travels with us) down to the dining room. Again, not that big a deal since we were able to get our dose in our room upstairs. We did have a reservation situation, as we reserved double non-smoking accommodations and were given a triple (!) smoking room. This was a problem the first night, since our neighbours were very heavy smokers, but by keeping the windows open we were able to get rid of the smoke smell. As for the three single beds, well, let's just say it was not the most romantic room we ever had! Hotel management offered to switch us to a non-smoking room, but we ended up declining when they told us that we would loose the great view of the park if we moved, as all their non-smoking rooms are on the other side of the building (which to me is unfair to non-smokers).

The roads form a rectangle around the park and it is basically only hotels all around the park. Only local circulation is allowed around the park, so you can't get squished by a car as long as you remain there. The exterior is quite nice, well it is basically identical to all the hotels next to it. The area seems pretty safe at night, there's a lot of tourists so it's not uncommon to see people roaming around late and I didn't see any bothersome or suspicious people. There's a bigger street right next to the park and there's two pubs, an italian restaurant, two tiny stores selling food and cigarettes(they stay open late), at basically a 30 second walk. I don't recommend going to the italian restaurant, the food isn't really good and it's very noisy. I wanted pasta with sauce ros\u00e9e, but they didn't have any on their menu, what kind of italian restaurant doesn't have that? Anyways... The paddington station and the metro entrance are a 2 minutes walk away. Although it's nice, I don't find this particularly relevant. The paddington station is only good if you plan on taking a train towards the west-north outskirts of the city, if you plan on going towards another direction you will need to use a different station. Moving around is very easy in london, it's maybe a 20 minute ride in metro to arrive to another train station. Don't pick this hotel if it's just for the paddington station. Now for the hotel itself. The first thing I noticed was the smell, and the carpets. Now there is always - constantly - a lady spraying air fresheners, everywhere and on everything. In fact, as we were entering the hotel, the lady was spraying some on the sofas in front of the counter. And for the week I was there, a lady could always be spotted in the process of spraying, on the carpet, in the air, no place is left unsprayed. Now the most troublesome aspect of all in this hotel is the carpets. These carpets are literally full of moisture, you can smell and see it immediately. At some places, the carpet is stained and wet - as if someone had put water on it. The smell is really bad at some places. This is no doubt the reason why they constantly spray air fresheners, in an attempt to cover up this smell. To me this is utterly ridiculous, obviously the owner is no good at understanding the concept of taking care of a building. The carpets are puffy and attract moisture, they need to be removed and replaced with industrial carpets before the moisture starts to rot the flooring. They also need to open the windows or install a dehumidifier to make sure not too much moisture accumulates. They also need to stop spraying, it's very bad for health. The walls are also full of moisture at certain spots, it's a real problem. Don't pick this hotel if you have allergies to this. Now - the room. Luckily, my room was OK. The carpet was good, and there wasn't any moisture inside. Everything was good with it, until I checked the bed. Hairs from the previous people. And the more I looked in the small cracks and spaces, the more hairs I found. I resigned myself to sleeping on top of the cover and using the blanket I got on the airplane, and not using the pillow. Definitively not fun. I'm not sure if they even changed the sheets or if they just left those of the people before me. That's probably the worse stuff to happen in a room. The dinning room is downstairs, which kind of sucks and is a waste because there's a park in front of the hotel, if they had made the dinning room upstairs them we could have seen outside while eating, which would have been cool. Luckily, there's no carpets in the dinning room, and no spraying, so you're not likely to vomit your food. The hot breakfast is alright.. I suppose, to some standards. It's basically bacon or sausages, eggs, ham, and beans. I can't really think of something more unhealthy than that. It's kind of fun the first 2 days, I never eat stuff like that usually. But for a week? You get real tired of it. There's toasts and cereals. Now here's the thing about the cereals, one particular cereal tasted like moisture. I don't know what happened to it, but it absorbed moisture or the smell of moisture, anyway something definitively happened. I don't know where they store this stuff, but yeah that's really gross. You're way better off getting a hotel without any breakfast plan and just go to a family restaurant and eat what you actually want for breakfast. Or go to a grocery store and buy something there. The staff is made out of at 90% of the breakfast staff ladies, who also are the cleaning ladies. Most of them seem foreign, and work there for money, not really sure what's the pattern there. They're mostly nice. The counter staff is greek, and one in particular was nice and helpful. Actually this hotel is owned by a greek business guy, hence the weird \"chrysos\" name. I believe I saw the owner, he didn't identify himself as such, but he acted like he owned the place, so either the owner or the friend of the owner. I met other tourists who went to slightly cheaper more popular hotels like the royal national, and the president hotel and they had absolutely awful times. Noisy, dirty and such. This hotel seems like a decent hotel considering there is basically nothing good in the price-range. If you're poor, you should consider this hotel. If you pick another hotel at the same price, you might end up with something really awful. Atleast this was somewhat decent, and it's a very small hotel, so it's not as overbearing If you can afford more expensive hotels, go for it, in london most hotels suck except those you pay more for.

We checked the hotel's review in tripadvisor before we made the booking. I must say that the hotel and its service exceeded our expectations. Of course, one should not compare it to a 5 star hotel but it's good value for the money we paid. The service we received from the front desk was very good and friendly. The room we had was very clean. The size of the bathroom was alright compared to some other hotels which I have stayed. Also, the water pressure in the shower was good and heater in the room was adequately warm. Breakfast was the usual choice of English or continental breakfast. What we expecially like about the hotel is, it is located very closeby to paddington station, about 4 to 5 min walk away and its location is equally convenient for those who use the Heathrow Express from or to the airport, like we did. There are a few pubs and restaurants around the vicinity of the hotel, which made food easily available. Also, there is a convenient store located closeby the hotel. Overall we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and we will definitely go back there again in our next trip!", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Value\u201d", "Author": "MaryCairn", "ReviewID": "UR20446007", "Content": "I stayed here for a week in July with my husband and teenage son in a triple room. I had expected the room to be extremely small but while it was smaller than North American standards, we had ample room and did not feel confined. The room was immaculate and always kept clean by housekeeping staff. It was a hot week in London when we were there so we appreciated that the window could open and we left it ajar all the while we were there as the hotel does not have air conditioning. Our only complaint was that the bathroom was far too hot - we asked to have the heat turned off but that only happened once and then it was on again - think it was the towel bar. The breakfast is adequate and enough to get you started. Location is excellent and like others have said, just a few minutes from the Paddington Station which is also convenient for the Heathrow express. Good grocery marts in the Paddington station which we used frequently to buy water and fruit. Hotel and location was very quiet as well. Front desk was also very helpful. If you take any of the Premier Tours, the pick up is at the Hilton right beside Paddington Station and this was great for us, since we took 2 of the tours out of the city. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palermo", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GiovanniPalermo", "ReviewID": "UR19137002", "Content": "I've been in Chrysos Hotel with my wife and my son of 9 years old in July 2008: I' had seen some reviews about this Hotel and I had chosen it for the cheap price (less than 600 pounds for a triple room for 7 days - breakfast aan taxes included), but when I arrived I was very surprised 'cause it was better than I could imagine; the recepionist and all the staff was kind and polite, the room was large, clean and in excellent condition with a big window looking at a nice park just in front of the hotel. The breakfast was OK (there was'nt plenty of food but, anyway, it was enough for my taste). The hotel is in Norfolk Square, a green and nice place with a lot of other cheap hotels. Nearby Norfolk Square there are a lot of restaurants, fast food, bars, grocery. I advice to eat to \"Dickens Tavern\", a nice Pub where you can eat in a relaxing envirement spending not more than 7 or 8 pounds for each one. Here you can find not only turists, bat also native. There is another good reason to stay in Chrysos hotel: the underground station (Paddington) is far only two blocks and so, it' easy to reach every part of London in short time. If you want to walk, you can reach in five minute Hyde Park where you can relax yourself.

As for service - IMHO it's the best you would expect in a small 3* hotel: polite and helpful personnel, clean rooms (though really small ones), clean facilities, everyday room service, substantial English breakfast well served and long lasting - up to 10:00 AM. Pleae note: hairdryer and kettle in the room are not provided by default, you need to request it. As you request - no problem, they give it to you. Nico, the hotel manager appeared to be absolutely reasonable and helpful. BTW, among usual free maps in the lobby they had red maps of London that provide 20% discounts for different places of interest in London. We used it, it works.

The room was so small we could hardly fit in with our luggage. The bed was placed under the window and you had to climb over it to get in, a hard back chair was at the end on the bed and allowed no room to walk around. The glass ceiling light was cracked and the room was very, very hot, but we could not leave the window open, while out, as the window was next to the fire exit stairs. The fire exit was used all hours of the night and the door was always being slammed, this made it very hard to sleep. We were very concerned with safety and the fact that people were coming up the fire exit. We reported this to the desk and were told they had adult teams staying with them. The shower head was not properly attached to the wall and the shower stall is so small, even for the average person. We recieved only soap as an amenity. At breakfast the juice/milk containers were always empty, There was no yogurt or fruit with the continetal breakfast and the toast was the thinest bread I have ever seen in my life and for some reason, 3 mornings only 1 side of the toast was toasted. We requested brown bread, but had no luck in recieving it. The cooked breakfast was not good, the egg was unedible, it had been cooked a long time prior to being served. We never found the bar that was advertised, but I did get a hairdryer after asking at the desk . We would not reccomend this hotel to anyone going to London. I have just seen this hotel advertised in a package deal as a 3 star plus, which is ridiculous.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool", "Title": "\u201c2 Star Room\u201d", "Author": "TheWanderer999", "ReviewID": "UR13453109", "Content": "I agree with the reviewer from Antwerp.
