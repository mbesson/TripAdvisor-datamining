The lobby doesn't look horrible, however the hallway and rooms are another matter. The carpeting in our room was old and needed a good cleaning and the bed was hard as rock. It just looked dingy. We settled in and my husband got a call to come to the desk. When he got there they said his credit card was declined, except we did not give them a credit card. They seemed a ltitle confused over the fact that the room was already paid for. Now back to the room. We soon realized the window (on a first floor room) did not lock and the bar across it was broken. Great. We went to the desk and were given a different room which was much better than the first including the pillow top mattress. Everything including the sheets and towels are just dingy and old. The entire hotel has an old ,unclean smell. I am not sure why any travel site even lists this.

Went again to the front desk and he offered to change the room yet again. We declined as we were already late to meet family and asked to have houskeeping clean the room for us. When we got back to the room at about 10:30 pm, we turned on the heat and the unit was very loud when it came on. We chose to try to ignore it as we were tired.

The lady at the desk looked overworked and tired, but the room service was kind. My guess is that this hotel is seriously understaffed. The stairs between the floors were absolutely dirty, for example. Breakfast was extremely poor, the coffee tasted like water and there was barely any bread to be found. The rooms are large enough,the beds were ok; but the walls between the rooms are thin. We had the misfortune to sleep next to a couple that arrived noisily at 4am, and continued partying and making noise until 6.30am. The Internet connection went down every 10 seconds, which is rather annoying if one wants to check mail, etc. If this is a Best Western, then the chain had better invest in a renovation if they want to make this hotel attractive again.

Breakfast was not quite there...everyone was waiting (quite a crowd with the Memorial Day long weekend) and the staff appeared to be struggling to decide whether to appease the guests or let them starve.
