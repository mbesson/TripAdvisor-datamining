However... For hotel quality it gets a 1 - hence my 3 star average. I have stayed there many times on business and the beds are always clean, maid staff is great BUT depending on the room you get, there can be black mold in places in the bathroom, stains here or there on the carpet or floor, I don't think there's been any painting or sprucing up in at least 5 years. Old heaters & air conditioners in room some of which might have difficulty. It's kinda like a crummy motel 6. If you don't mind that, then go for it and save the money because it's the cheapest hotel in the area. If you have money to spare or blow then I highly recommend you don't bother with this place and stay at the Farmer's Daughter just a block away. Even the Roadside in (a half block away) is better (but more money) although not better by much. Staff is nice and helpful. Shuttles pick up out front if you want one.

Started off staying at The Farmer's Daughter, then prices went up. Found the Beverly Laurel Motor Motel and stayed there (see review). I was in a hurry and went to book what I thought was the afformentioned Motel, thinking boy their prices are just fantastic. As I was going down Beverly Blvd being guided by my GPS, she passed the Beverly Laurel and continued down Beverly Blvd until \"Your destination is on the left\"-The Beverly Inn. I suddenly realized my booking mistake. My husband and I decided to make the best of it. Here are the pluses: 1. Free Parking (We paid for overnight Parking at the Grove because spots are small for our 4WD and wasn't comfortable to park on street as suggested by front desk. 2.Walkable distance to The Grove Farmer's Mkt 3.Low Price Having said that, I would not stay again. The room appeared clean but it was odd. For example the telephone was missing some of the push buttons and the wastebaskets were lined with grocery store plastic bags. We got in about 1030pm and heard a drip coming from the bathroom.. Looking up, it was apparent the upstairs room had a leak in the toliet area. My husband asked to change rooms (no one wants to be on the commode and be hit with a drip from the upstairs toliet). They did accomodate that, but who wants to change rooms at that time. Also, don't be seduced by the fact they have a pool. The pool is a std small kidney pool. But the odd thing is, is that it has a fence around it that starts at the edge of the pool and looks like a \"Pool Prison\". Outside of the fencing, there is no lounge chairs or anyplace to relax by the pool. They'd do better to turn the pool into a Koi pond and put plants around it.
