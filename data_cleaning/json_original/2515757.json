Only a 10 minute walk from the centre of San Diego and the nightlife and restaurants which were in abundance, and 15 minutes away from the train which takes you over the Mexican border into Tiajuana. The room was spotlessly clean, and apart from the private facilities had satelite T.V, air-conditioning, and room service.

Peeling paint, mold, stained sink/tub, bent and dented lampshades, etc. Clearly an attempt to clean the room had been made (the very strong smell of cleaning products and mop strands on the floor testified to that); equally clear, the attempt failed. Hairs in bathroom, new-looking but grungy carpet, etc. Friendly staff, although the functioning of the coffee maker in the lobby seemed to mystify them. Stale pastries and some fruit comprise the breakfast. Plenty of parking, sharing a parking lot with the Hooters restaraunt next door. Very disappointing overall for a Choice Hotel establishment. Would recommend this motel as a last resort, and only when you want a cheap place to sleep and are too tired to care about everything else.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hesperia, CA", "Title": "\u201cNo Hot Water\u201d", "Author": "MissBkay", "ReviewID": "UR14689156", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for three weeks for work. We work nights so our crew didn't arrive until around midnight and when we used the night window the man was very rude. The first room was nice enough with high wood cielings. But the next morning we discovered there was no hot water in the entire hotel and there hadn't been all weekend yet they continued to rent out rooms and failed to tell us until we asked Monday evening. It wasn't fixed until we came back the next week. The next hotel room had gashes in the walls, and both rooms had trash under the beds. The maids didn't come until 4 or 5pm and when we asked for service earlier in the morning and they agreed they still were not there until 6pm! They also spilled a bag I had in the room and failed to pick it up. The vending machine doesn't give you what you want sometimes and you have to buy something twice to actually get it. It is rarely restocked. One of our microwaves didn't work and the central air doesn't either so personal fans were brought to us! IN SAN DIEGO- NO AC! Plus, the lights hardly ever worked. There wasn't a clock in one of the rooms. They failed to give us our wake up call. And there was not enough wall sockets for the fridge, microwave, clock when we had it, and TV, and light all to be plugged in at once. It was ridiculous. There were only one large towel, for the pool, a bath towel, a facial towel, and a hand towel- for a double room! The water pressure is really bad, as well. The pool was dirty and is placed next to a tree that leaves fall from into the pool in all types of weather. Basically, if my boss didn't pay for this I would have walked away the first night.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201cNot great, not really bad.\u201d", "Author": "omer66", "ReviewID": "UR11878157", "Content": "This is located in a very quiet place, and is quite easy to get to from the freeway.

We were in the market for a budget-friendly family motel, nothing fancy, no frills. However, we did expect our room to be clean and habitable. At first glance, our room appeared neat, though it was obviously not a luxury suite. Then we noticed that the ceiling above the bathtub was cracked and peeling, and black mildewy pieces had fallen into the tub, making a bath undesirable. Since our infant and 5-year-old don't take showers, we realized this would be a problem during our stay, but at that point we still figured we could manage. We settled in a bit, and let our crawling infant play with his toys on the floor. Shortly afterwards, we saw that his knees, feet and hands were black with grime from the carpet. Yes, black. There's no telling what was in that carpet to make him so dirty in such a short period of time. We checked out the following morning and found a different hotel for the remainder of our stay. The front desk staff claimed that the carpets are steam cleaned every three weeks, but we suspect that our room was not part of that schedule. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone with small children, people with allergies, or anyone who would simply rather not sleep in filth.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cAt least it was cheap\u201d", "Author": "Susano195", "ReviewID": "UR3726217", "Content": "The price ($69) was the about best we could find in the San Diego area on the last weekend of July.
