Breakfasts were basic continental, the same every day and not at all imaginative, but good enough to get the day started. Bathroom mould was a little worrying as was the extractor fan which had a life of its own. We didn't have much to do with the staff, but they seemed helpful.

Turned into a small (smelly) alley for the entrance. Once you get inside it was quite cozy. Our room was not finished by the time we arrived which was 2 hours past check in time. Quite troublesome as we needed to leave some of our stuff from the hand luggage, go to the bathroom and pray before going to the Dodge Palace. Well, we made do by repacking right in front of the concierge which is just in front of the dining place and used their bathroom nearby. After we came back that later (tired and spent after walking trying to find halal food) we came to a very small (common I think), cozy, very clean room. Interestingly the bathroom is large. Our room was furnished with dark green wall paper which make the room looked even smaller. After few hours I got used to it. There is a fridge, TV with only one English speaking channel, closet (seems to part of the wall). One thing they don't have is tea/coffee making facilities which was quite important to us (but also seems common in Venice). Not much power outlet either as we needed them for laptop, phone charger, camera battery charger all at once. Another thing, they do have a wifi connection access but you have to pay EU6 for an hour or EU12 for cumulative 20 hours. The service is actually provided by a local telco instead of the hotel. We took the 20 hours connection and the connection was very good. Although they said we can use the connection on our 3G phone throughout Venice, actually that only applies for hotspots which we can hardly remember where. Breakfast was nice the first day as we got homemade bread and croissant (we came from rice eating region) and homemade hot cocoa. They also have cereal, biscuits, cheese, ham, fruit. But after 3 days of the same thing may not be inviting anymore. With all the downsides we did not regret staying there because there is a small halal kebab store just right at the corner which we frequent esp for dinner. The other halal kebab is far near Piazza Roma (20-40 mins away with vaporetto) They also sells pizza but the meaty ones are not halal. They say they will have the halal ones probably next year.

A left turn at the top brought us out into the square (Campo SS Filippo e Giacomo) by a pharmacy (most of the \"squares\" in Venice are neither square nor rectangular). This Pharmacy is at the bottom right of the square and you need to leave by the top right exit. Looking up at the wall in front of you will see \"Hotel Rio\" sign. The Castello is effectively behind this one. So walk up that alley, which has a glass fronted bar on the left under the Hotel Rio.

The bathroom had a big shower, sink, bidet and WC. We only took one wheeled case and small backpacks, as we knew what to expect with getting about in Venice. If we were on a world tour with big cases each then the space might have felt a bit tight perhaps.

Unfortunately as you rose each flight so did the temperature. Our room was stifling until around 04:00 am when the struggling air-con finally overcame the heat. Our room was a reasonable size but the fabric covered walls were quite shabby. The bathroom was tiny, grotty and needed to be left for 30mins after each shower to allow the three inches of water to drain from the floor (overflow from shower recess). We advised management of this and the only response was that they were already aware.We travelled with our preteen & friends who have teenage children. Our friends stayed on a lower floor & it appeared their room had been recently revamped. Lovely new bathroom with massaging jets and a bath.

I picked the Hotel from the airmiles website. I chose it for its proximity to St Marks. We arrived in Venice on Jet2 from Leeds and walked down to catch the Water bus we got off at the stop before St Marks square as suggested on the hotel info and had no problems finding the hotel even though it is tucked away down a narrow street. I think our room was number 5. It was just at the top of the stairs overlooking the entrance. The room was small with twin beds pushed together to form a double bed (as is standard in most european hotels) we had a small built in wardrobe, dressing table with mini bar bedside table either side of the bed and a chair. As we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room, size was of no consequence,the room was big enough and pleasant enough. I was very pleased with the ensuite which appeared to be quite new. Lovely walk in shower toilet/bidet and a hairdryer by the washbasin. The decor of our room was dark blue the walls were fabric covered which I really liked. You cant expect 21st century decor in a 17th century building. The air conditioning was great for my husband too cool for me but we found a happy medium. We only had breakfast in the hotel which was a standard continental and quite adequate, plenty of coffee, and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for the staff.(a family staying at the same time as us asked for their croissants to be warmed) We didn't make use of the bar facilities or the mini bar so I can't comment on them. We are in our late forties and spend a lot of time out and about we chose the hotel for it's central location and weren't disappointed.

They provide you with a fold out old school bed, I don't think a double bed exists in this hotel and the beds are uncomfortable. I stayed in 2 different rooms and they both had dysfunctional air conditioners. 1 bathroom was in poor shape, 1 in good shape, and 1 didn't have shower. 1 room smelled unbelievably strong of urine. When we got their the smell was masked with about 3 ounces of perfume, but after that faded, it was intolerable. We couldn't sleep at all and felt sick for most of our stay. The service for the most part was awful. They claim 24hr service, but the night clerk sleeps during his shift at the tables in the common lounge. Not only that, but he gives you a hard time if you want to go out after about 10 pm because it is cutting into his nap time. They don't appear to care about you, only about your money, and don't make much of an effort after you're booked. We could not get access to internet at all, because none of the staff had any idea how to obtain it (they said it was offered by a third party).

I rang the reception, to say that I thought my ceiling was about to fall in, who made no apology and just said \"the workmen start at 8 am\". It was impossible to stay in the room at this point , it really sounded like they were knocking down walls, and I feel I should have been warned at least beforehand about this, or, perhaps the workmen should at least have started at 9am? Thankfully they do not work at the weekend. They are apparently, refurbishing rooms and the noise vibrates throughout the whole Hotel. I only found this out by going to look for myself! I do feel that the Management have a duty to the guests and prospective guests to warn them about these intrusive/noisy works.
