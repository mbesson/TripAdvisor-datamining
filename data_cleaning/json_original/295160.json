A very simple breakfast buffet was included in this price. It is situated near a tram station, only a few stops from Sultanahmet Place and near a metro station that leads straight to the airport. Next to the hotel you can find little stores that sell almost everything you might need during your stay and take away restaurants that sell the most delicious kebab for 1 euro and stay open after midnight (we always made a stop when returning late)", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLook further than Birbey Hotel - it's a hole!\u201d", "Author": "nirvanpsych", "ReviewID": "UR81789517", "Content": "The condition of this hotel is worthy only of being condemned. No work has been done on it since it was built and everything is mouldy, mildewing, falling apart and barely functional. The lavatory cistern works but the top fall off when you lift the button. Wall paper is peeling, carpet is moulting and is disintegrating as is everything in the room, creating dust. Cleaning consists only of changing sheets and these are full of a smelly chemical. Only one short sheet covers the mattress which has black mould stains, water and blood stains, lumps and god knows what else. It is disgusting! I had a severe allergic reaction to something in the first room and the second night, the room they moved us to was so small we bruised our legs trying to get past the beds to the table. The TV was a joke in both rooms. No matter how cheap and it wasn't that cheap, as I stayed in far better for the same price in Izmir and Kusadasi, this hotel must be condemned and health authorities alerted. It's saving grace is the bevy of very handsome, courteous young male staff who are on hand to do anything for you like bring hot water so we can at least make our own cup of tea rather than pay 2 lire for it. Service can't be faulted. They were lovely! Breakfast is the usual Turkish style and hubby had to bring his own coffee, milk, muesli and orange juice. I didn't mind the olives, chilly fetta, tomatoes, cucumber, black coffee/tea and fresh bread.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cI found a dried bugger on the blanket...\u201d", "Author": "KonnieAnne", "ReviewID": "UR80490280", "Content": "I found a dried bugger on the blanket, enough said?

Somewhere to wash a days travelling and wandering off of my skin. This however was definately NOT what myself and my travelling partner got. The walls were mouldy, the wallpaper was falling off, it was dark, stuffy and hot. On top of this it had the most horrific smell- so bad that I could barely sleep and it aggravated my allergies. The shower did not work properly and the towel rail was broken. It was really one problem after the next. It was a complete dissapointment and a waste of money. The location was not great, it was tucked in a dark corner away from resteraunts and our taxi drivers had to call several people to find out where it was. The breakfast was the traditional turkish style, bread, olives cheeses, cucumber, tomatoe etc. Fine if your into that kind of thing but at this stage all I could taste in the back of my throat was mold. We ended up leaving a day early (without being refunded) because we we're simply miserable here.

Electric wires were hanging out of walls and all electrical fittings were loose or not there. It did have a mini bar as advertised, but nothing in it. It did have a radio and television as advertised but the radio didn't work at all and the television only worked when it wanted to. The walls were nicotine colour and stained. The net curtains were grey with dirt. I adivse everyone to pay a few more Euros and stay somewhere else.
