It is a short walk to San Marco square and you can reach all venice on foot or you can use the public transport to see the lovely city of Venice. The staff is specially friendly and helped us with all our requests such an planning a taxi tour to Murano , showing us nice restaurants, etc. The rooms are clean and specially the rooms with a terrace are quite large for a Venician hotel. Free WiFi Internet is available in the entire hotel and you can get 24 hour pass from the frount desk. Theybare always there for you with a smile. The breakfast served in the ground floor is a good start for a day and is of good quality and taste, besides, the coffee and milk served there is the most delicious in the city . Tip for tourists: tap water in Venice is drinkable and tasty and as I searched in internet is the best in Italy, so don't waste your money buying mineral water. There are also many drinkable water taps in the city Tip for those traveling to Venice by plane: get a two way ticket from and to the airport from the tourist guide desk in the aririvals hall for 25\u00e2\u201a\u00ac and you will save 5 euros.

And the 1, 2, N (night line) and the airport shuttle service ( Alilaguna blue line ) stop there. 2) the hotel is very easy to find, walk on Riva di Schivoni (the main promenade) right from the Vaporetto stations, and after 2 bridges you see a big church , right after it you turn left to Calle di piete and the hotel is at the end of the ally! 3) it's easy to get to the city and the hotel via the shuttle service ( a water bus ) that operates till after midnight . the terminal is outside from the main terminal at the airport and it takes a short walk from the terminal . it costs 16 euros (round trip 26) , and you can buy tickets on the boat itself. It takes about an hour from the airport to San Zaccaria (it's the sixth staion) 4) Venice and the hotel awaits you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA fabulous alternative to the overpriced\u201d", "Author": "baef47", "ReviewID": "UR124240204", "Content": "24 years ago we stayed at the Bisanzio while on our honeymoon.

It is possible that the AirCon was not working, although we didn't need it. It was lovely just to enjoy the open window, and there were no mosquitoes, this being the end of October. The location was perfect for our purposes - visiting the Biennale, sightseeing, etc. The water taxi takes you from the airport to a spot only a short walk from the hotel; a return ticket cost 25 Euros. Allow plenty of time though for your return trip - it takes perhaps one and a half hours - though it is simple and not at all stressful, provided you leave in good time. These Alilaguna boats leave for the airport at 25 past and 5 to the hour, and the ticket office people are very helpful in telling you which stop to use - it's about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

Taking the vaporetto from the train station down the Grand Canal is a beautiful ride. But unless you hired a watertaxi, getting yourself and your luggage to any hotel can be exhausting. The canal streets around San Marco are packed with tourists and vendors, and I think most travel agents or individuals booking their own hotel seem to book those hotels in closest proximity to San Marco. However, getting away from the crowds of Venice is much more relaxing and gives you a better feeling of what Venetians living here enjoy. I have stayed at the Hotel Bisanzio twice and both times I enjoyed the location so much, I wanted to come back. The last stop on the Vaporetto is San Zaccaria, Exit to the right on Riva Degli Schiavoni and cross over one of the canal bridges and take the first left at Calle del Pieta. Down at the end of the quiet street is the Hotel Bisanzio. Most of the hotel prices in Venice are higher than other cities in Italy, but Bisanzio serves a full-breakfast, unlike many. There rooms vary from very modest to more elegant. The rooms are not large, but the hotel is very intimate and the staff friendly. I loved the location because you did not have to compete to get on vaporetto at the busiest stop at San Marco. From this location you can go to San Giorgo or any other stops going down the Grand Canal and you might even get a good seat to enjoy the ride verses standing. Another benefit is that the hotel is close to some restaurants that are not as busy in the evening because they are away from the main tourist attractions. When the cruise ship traffic leaves for the day, you will find that many of the streets of Venice are deserted. Although the streets are dark, Venice is very safe to walk around in the evening and enjoy sea breeze or the sunset. The hotel is more than happy to arrange a watertaxi which will pick you up at the back door of the hotel and take you to the airport or the train station when you leave. If you like the crowds and the noise of Piazza San Marco, then the Bisanzio is not for you.

One word of warning; do not accept the 'free' water-taxi service, to Murano, laid on by the hotel, unless you are prepared to accept the invitation to visit the glass factory which awaits you on your arrival.You are expected to purchase items from the factory as part of the deal.This, in hindsight was a mistake, since the 'arrangement' was not made clear to us and resulted in an angry reception from the hotel staff on our return, leaving us feeling embarrassed and annoyed at the misunderstanding which somewhat dampered our , otherwise, enjoyable day.

It is located a mere five minute walk from the bustling St Mark's Square and only 100 metres from the lagoon waterfront. An early walk before breakfast when these areas are fresh and free from crowds is highly recommended. The water bus transport is also only about two minutes away, so it a very short distance to walk with luggage upon arrival from or departure to the airport. Despite being near one of Venice's main centres of attraction, the hotel is situated along a narrow, relatively quiet passageway. Our room overlooked a courtyard and we heard no external sounds whatsoever. (Although we cannot comment on other rooms). All members of staff were friendly, informative, helpful and extremely courteous. Our room was spotlessly clean and equally immaculate when we returned each day. The bathroom had modern fittings with an over-bath shower and unlimited hot water. Shampoo / shower wash, soap and tissues were provided and replenished as necessary. There was plenty of lighting, provided by chandelier lights and bedside lamps in the bedroom. Together with the classic style furniture, the room had an attractive appearance. Effective air conditioning made this a comfortable retreat, both day and night. A fridge provided a good selection of soft and alcoholic drinks. There was an excellent selection at breakfast, served from 7:15am for those wishing to make an early start. This included a good supply of hot and cold drinks, cereal, a variety of meats, cheese and various spreads and yogurts. Also, a self service heated container provided eggs and bacon. There were several different breads, including a delicious sweet variety with almonds and, occasionally, apple cake. A bread toaster was also available. All in all, a perfect base for exploring this wonderful and enchanting city. Tips A 40 minutes gondola trip costs 80 Euros. If you just want the chance to experience a gondola ride and don't mind the fact the it only lasts 5 minutes, take a trip across the Grand Canal at one or more of several ferry (trahgetto) points at a cost of only 50 cents per person. Food and drinks are very expensive and plenty of re-hydration is needed in the heat. Recycle your plastic water bottle by refilling it at the drinking fountains to be found in many squares. If you want to escape crowds in the main tourist areas, you will need a need a good map to be able to negotiate the maze of alleyways. You will be well rewarded when you come across all manner of delights on the way which might otherwise be missed and you will have more opportunity of discovering the true Venice.

After perusing Tripadvisor.com and noticing their high rating, I booked a 2 night stay. After a grueling 7 hour journey, the first thing I realized after entering the room was that the comfort level of the bed was equivalent to a piece of plywood. The two pillows were as flat as pancakes and offered very little support. If you are a person with back problems, you may be running to the nearest pharmacy to buy pain killers. The hallway and the room itself were scorching hot and after turning on the air conditioning for a couple of hours, the air conditioning stopped working and started emitting heat instead. We were forced to open the windows and were then accosted by multiple mosquitoes that bit us throughout the night. I counted 14 mosquito bites the next day. There was a free daily breakfast that was free for good reason. It included cold cuts, cheese, eggs, and bacon. On the second day, the eggs were mostly gone and there was no bacon left. The food looked less appetizing than a McDonald's breakfast. When inquiring about a late check-out policy, the desk employee was extremely snarky, arrogant, and rude. He said \"Well I don't know what YOU are used to, but we do not do that here.\" In past experiences, most highly rated hotels offer a late check-out option for an additional fee. We were told that we had to vacate the room by 11:00 am and since our flight was at 10:30 pm, we asked if it was possible to keep our room until 12:00 pm instead of 11:00 am. With a grimace and a smile, the receptionist said that this was not possible. When we asked about holding our luggage during the day, he assured us that our bags would be safe even though they would be completely in the open and available for anyone to steal. The bags were in an area that was not visible to him from the front desk and we were not at all reassured that our bags would be safe.

So be careful late nite alone. I always hung out just before nite fall, but I felt very secure and safe there and the hosptality was great.

He was attentive to guests needs, willing to share feedback about locations, and excited to hear about our return from the Ducati factory.

The meal was simple, clean (not saucy), grilled, healthy and scrumptious. In general, this was the only city in Italy where the house white wines were very good. Compared to Rome, Florence, Verona and Riva del Garda, Venice has the best food! It is possible to go dairy free in Italy.

The staff was incredibly helpful in every possible aspect. There is an internet point but no CD drive so don't expect to do anything concerning up or downloading to CD. They offer free transportation to Murano but the boat only operates with a minimum of 4 people if you have less than that you have to wait and hope that someone else wants to go. We waited an hour then decided to take public transportation. Bisanzio is very close to Piazza San Marco but that means its further from the Grand Canal and also the train station (at least a 30 minute ride if you get on the right boat, could be an hour). Luca at the front desk gave us his card and told us about a beautiful glass factory in Murano, when we got there they told us they weren't doing any tours but when we showed Luca's card they got us right in on a private tour where one of the masters came out to do a glass blowing display just for us :) The name of the factory is Linea Mazzuccato and was definitely one of the nicest glass factories on Murano, if you go make sure to ask for Nicola, he was our guide, he spoke English very well and was one of the kindest people we met while in Italy. Bisanzio was nice and clean and had a decent continental breakfast, the rooms are by no means luxurious just average but clean, and the a/c in our room was working but just barely. Venice is exspensive so if you're looking for a good hotel at a good price then I definitely reccommend Bisanzio. I wouldn't reccommend it for people who are looking for luxury or romance, there are no views from the hotel and the only food service they offer is for breakfast, no room service or dinner in the hotel. \"Al Scalinetto\" was reccommended by the staff and was very closeby and great food.", "Date": "November 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced but great location\u201d", "Author": "TravelLovers2", "ReviewID": "UR10478131", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights and I must say that the hotel is overpriced.

We asked where we could take the boat to Murano and immediately he wanted to call us a taxi that would take us FREE, but there is a catch and we found out later on. The cab takes you to a factory where you are received by a lady that asks that driver what hotel you are coming from, so you know there has to be commission involved. After touring the factory you cannot go anywhere else but back to where they want to take you. The cab ride back is also free but they dont take you back to where you came from, they drop you off at the nearest part of the island. Luckily from there we were able to take a boat to Burano and missed out on seeing anything else in Murano because we didnt know there was anything else.

The hotel has a computer with internet access but it is pricey and only available in 1 hour packages.

I have to say that Hotel Bisanzio and Venice were our least favorite part. We ended up in the apartment building next door. It seemed okay at first, down a side street, until our very noisy neighbors moved in the room above us. The apartment had doorbells and their young children had fun ringing our doorbell at 11pm when we had put our kids to bed at 9pm for a very early fligt the next day. When we checked in, we were told that Best Western made a mistake, and put 3 people instead of 4. The man at the desk made certain it was not his fault (nor ours) and ultimately, it was our tough luck (otherwise, I think we could have gotten a better room). The shower was the real kicker - there was a staircase halfway through it. I am surprised people don't hit their heads and get hurt. If you are over 5ft, this leaves you half of the bathtub to stand in, or you can take a bath, but you better stand up on the right side when you get out, or you will slam your head. The breakfast was so/so and in general, we found the food in Venice to be less tasteful and more expensive than the other parts of Italy we visited. Venice is very touristy and everythign was a lot more expensive. Once you see San Marco, the canals, bridges, we didn't find a lot to do and ended up going to the beach for two days. We did splurge and hired a water taxi to take us to the airport for our early flight and although expensive, we are glad we did it for the experience and convenience of not have to move luggage up and down steps and onto the very slow water bus. Given the cost of Hotel Bisanzio versus what the other hotels charge, it is probably a good value, but I would definitely stay away from apt. 115.

Location is also well-served by vaporetto, making arrival and departure much easier than many other hotels. The Alilaguna service is right at the vaporetto dock, that is the most direct and least expensive way to get to the airport. You essentially get all of the convenience of a water-side hotel without paying for it. It is also easy to find, so if teens go off by themselves, you are meeting friends, or you arriving after dark you have a fighting chance. Being part of the Best Western chain makes it easy to book and communicate with, but once you are there you have no idea you are in a chain hotel (a plus in our minds). The hotel itself is in two combined old buildings that have been extensively and recently renovated. Ambiance is contemporary without being inappropriately avante garde.

We had two superior rooms that we booked directly with the hotel after finding a better price online. The hotel could not match the web price, but offered to upgrade us to superior rooms for their regular room price. This deal worked well for us. One room (401) had a pleasant terrace, though we stayed during a heat wave, so really couldn't use it much. Because the hotel is tucked back into narrow Castello streets, there are no real views from the room windows. The terrace provided some bit of a view.

Upstairs was a loft with a full size bed and bathroom. The room was immaculately clean and very comfortable with plenty of room for all of our luggage. It was a nice luxury having 2 bathrooms, especially with 2 teenage girls! The room was located in a building next to the main hotel building (this building contains the 3 Superior Family Suites). My only complaint about this room is that the bed was hard. The front desk staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The breakfast buffet consisted of cereals, bread and rolls, yogurt, meats & cheeses, juices and coffee. It was more than enough for us as we are not big breakfast eaters. The location was excellent, within walking distance to all of the sights, shopping, and plenty of restaurants. When we returned to the hotel following our cruise, the Family Suite was not yet ready, so they gave us 2 regular rooms instead (for the same price). Again, the rooms were very clean, a little on the small side but fine for 2 people and were located in the main building.

Our very quiet family suite was new and impeccably clean, the daily maid service of the highest quality, and the room well-appointed and spacious. We had two floors overlooking a small drawing room, replete with TV having American and British news channels and programming, along with Italian stations. Our room was as comfortably air-conditioned as we desired, even on days when the temperature was in the 90's F. The upstairs shower stream was strong and the water hot, a mini-fridge well-stocked with juices, water, soda, wine and local libations, as well as snack foods. The downstairs bath was quite large, and the hotel stocked all the usual amenities one would expect at a 4 star hotel. The hotel staff were all simply fabulous, taking great pleasure in answering our questions and directing us to proper vaporetto lines, shopping areas and restaurants of their recommendation, and others of our predetermined choice. Tony was especially \"simpatico,\" twinkling his eyes and smiling often, making jokes and doing everything he could to make our stay pleasant. As an example, our three separate flights from Amsterdam, London and Athens were each delayed on arrival. At 7:30 PM after we each had arrived, he called an hour before we wanted to have dinner at a highly sought after restaurant recommended in the Frommer's guide, Trattoria di Remigio (where normally you must book reservations well in advance). He spoke directly with the maitre'de, asking him to please try to squeeze us in as a favor to the Hotel. We dined graciously one and a half hours later at 9 PM. And this on a Friday evening as well. On another occasion I was given superb directions to the UNESCO office, and later, after an unfortunate reaction to seppia (cuttlefish), I was given very specific directions to the Ospitale Civile (well worth visiting next to the fantastic Chiesa di San Giovanni and Paolo and piazza, by the way), where, after communicating in French to the doctore, I was placed on an IV and treated for an allergic reaction. The hotel staff also checked to see if I had arrived OK, and later relayed messages from the doctore who called to check on me after my discharge. Tony translated the doses on my script for medication, and translated what the doctore had said re followup care. The location of the Bisanzio is perfect, adjacent to the Hotel Metropole, literally a stroll over two bridges on the Riva degli Schiavone for ten minutes to Piazza San Marco. It is adjacent to the church where Vivaldi composed many of his masterpieces. Our rate was very well-priced for Venice at 210 Euros per night, the breakfast a cut above the traditionally well-prepared continental fare, with an option for cooked eggs to order for a modest charge if we desired. The juices and coffee were excellent, and everything on the menu in unlimited quantities in a beautiful room decorated with blue stained glass. The photos on the website, while faithful, really don't do this spectacular hotel justice when in person. The Bisanzio truly is worthy of 4 stars, and we can't imagine a better stay and hope to return again soon.
