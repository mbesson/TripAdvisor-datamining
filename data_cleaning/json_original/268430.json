I've never been at a hotel with a better outdoor layout. The patio, pool, and beach are woven together seamlessly, there is plenty of seating, from tables, couches, and beach chairs, and no matter where you sit, you get food and drink service. The young men on the beach are great, they set you up with lounge chairs, a table, and dig a deep hole for your umbrella. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The room is standard, nothing fancy but very clean and nice. The more expensive \"ocean front\" room has a great view, but the balcony is a bit small, we didn't spend much time out there. But honestly, you have no need to do anything in your room here besides sleep. The grounds are lovely and welcoming, you will want to spend every minute outside. If you like it less crowded, I highly recommend going during the week. We left on Friday, and the place was getting a bit crowded. Of course, the weekend apparently is quite hopping, with lots of music and dancing, so if you like a bit of a party, it seems like the place to be! Please ignore the reviews about the plane noise. It is not an issue, period! You hear the jets when you are outside, a couple an hour, and for a few seconds. You hear nothing in your room with the door closed. Oh, and a tip, it took us a while to read the door sign -- when the balcony door is open, the AC won't turn on. Environmental! The area is a bit remote, but that makes for a great beach experience -- quiet and beautiful. You can walk to some nearby restaurants, and a Walgreens. We ate breakfast at the nearby Piu Bello, mainly because there is a \"sister\" Piu Bello in New York that is quite good. This place was bad. The food was tasteless, the restaurant was dirty, and service was awful. Not worth it. If you want the best dinner around, though, take a taxi to Jose Enrique. It's located inland in a small house in a residential area. The menu changes nightly, the waiters bring it to you on dry erase boards. This was possibly the best meal both my boyfriend and I have ever eaten, from start to finish. The service was fantastic, also. But I digress, this is a review of the hotel! Put simply, I rarely return to the same place, but will strongly consider coming back to the Isla Verde Marriott, and will recommend it far and wide!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFUN IN THE SUN :)\u201d", "Author": "abc12343", "ReviewID": "UR128339067", "Content": "Just returned from a 7 night stay @ the Courtyard Marriot in Isla Verde with my Teenage Daughter and what a wonderful vacation it was.The staff are some of the most friendliest and helpful people I've ever interacted with,they will go out of the way for you during your stay.The restaraunts in the resort we're def overpriced and the food wasn't the greatest however that certianly didn't rain on our parade.There is a Grocery Store,Dennys,Chilis,Pizza Hut,Burger King,Taco Bell,Walgreens,Ponderosa and more all in walking distance.Not being familiar with the territory we would walk up the beach vs the Street and simply walk through a resort which would bring us out to the area where all these places we're located.The airplanes never bothered us once,we we're never woken up @ night from them either.There are busses for $0.75 that will take you to Old San Juan as well as other places,it may take longer than a taxi simply due to the stops in between but it is certianly well worth it.We did the taxi thing once for $24.00 though I prefer the buss mainly because taxi drivers are maniacs on the road.

The staff allowed us to check-out at the appointed time & held our bags until we were ready to leave for the cruise ship. Therefore, we enjoyed a beautiful morning on the beach. Taxis were right outside the front door to take us to port when we were ready. I also used the gym the morning we were there. It is small, but was not crowded. And there's a nice view of the beach from the tread mills & other machines. We didn't venture outside of the hotel. And we were unable to walk around Old San Juan.

We were originally booked at the Hampton Inn down the street, but at the last minute decided it was worth the extra $200 to start our vaction on the beach rather than feeling we were in transition - and I think that was a great choice. We arrived early evening and check in was a breeze. We dropped our bags off in our room and headed for the beach bar. The beach (all public) was busy but it was Saturday. Drinks were $6 (though we got 4 free rum punch coupons when we checked in) and service was slow - but that's par for the course in the Caribbean. Isla Verde beach is very nice and watching the sunset was enjoyable. We walked to La Playita restaurant later in the evening for a nice dinner on the water. The next morning was worth the extra cost - rather than sitting in our hotel room waiting for noon to roll around so we could go to the ship, we were on the beach by 8:30 with our complimentary coffee from the lobby (plus a fruit plate, 2 muffins and 3 bottled waters for $18), and spent 3 hours in the sun / ocean / pool. Beach chairs are plentiful and the beach/water is great. We grabbed some lunch from the pool bar ($20 for three huge hot dogs with fries and one soda). A late checkout wasn't available so we left the room right at noon. It was easy to get a cab to the pier for $20. As for the room, the view from the partial ocean view balcony was great if you didn't look directly down (to the roof of the lobby/casino), and though the room was showing some age if you looked really closely (at say the plaster in the corners in the bathroom) it was just fine and nicely appointed. Beds were comfortable and the free bottled water was a plus.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, but with some mixed feelings...\u201d", "Author": "jb0825", "ReviewID": "UR128195229", "Content": "We just returned from an 8 night stay at the Courtyard Marriott in Isla Verde. Overall it was a very nice hotel, but here are the pros and cons (for us): PROS: the hotel was right on the beach, and it was fantastic that you could sit at the pool and watch the ocean. Really lovely pool area, with swim up bar, hammocks, and large chaises. Nice fitness room (though small, it was fine, never overcrowded). Every employee at the hotel was very nice, helpful and friendly. Very clean. Great beach, with surfing nearby and a roped off area that turned out to be protecting leatherback turtle eggs (my kids loved this)! Right near the airport, which meant we could stay almost right up until our flight. :) Very good food at each of the restaurants, especially outside (Sirena). The salsa lessons Thurs night looked like a lot of fun. :) CONS: Pretty isolated. You could walk to Walgreens, and a great little restaurant called La Playita, and maybe one or two other things, but that is about it. To get anywhere, you need a car ($20 parking fee) or a taxi ($20 each way to just about anywhere - the Condado, old San Juan, etc. The hotel restaurants were EXPENSIVE, but to eat out anywhere you need to tack on the $40 taxi fare... so overall it was very costly. Even breakfast at the cafe in the hotel was $$$ (2 bagels, 2 coffees, 1 orange juice and 1 corn muffin = $17). We did find a cute breakfast place not too far away (I think it was called Piu Bello) but still, we wound up getting cereal and disposable bowls at Walgreens after awhile. There was also some construction going on (during Easter/Spring Break week? Really?) as it seemed they were putting in a new patio. It was noisy and the red fencing around the area killed the view when we sat outside to eat. I also got eaten alive by the no-see-ums, but luckily no one else in my family did. Lastly, we paid for a room upgrade to a \"Junior Suite\" and while the ocean view was wonderful, the room was basically a regular hotel room with maybe 10 square feet added. Having the fridge and microwave was great, though. So.... all in all, we had a wonderful time, but next time I think I'd stay in Condado or closer to Old San Juan restaurants, or at least at a hotel with free parking.

I was a little concerned about the negative reviews but, there were also enough positive reviews that I figured perhaps the negative reviews were written by people that were especially noise sensitive. I live downtown in a fairly good size city so I'm used to background noise from traffic construction, etc.... and figured I wouldn't mind hearing a few planes take off. This was a HUGE mistake. The planes taking off were not in the distance but, literally across the street from our room. I don't think it could have been nosier if we were standing on the actual runway. The noise is slightly (and I do mean slightly) less bothersome on the beach but, only because there are other background noises on the beach somewhat cover it up. And the noise is pretty much constant as planes seemed to take off every 10-15 minutes when we were lucky and every 2-5 minutes when not. The Hotel has a nice lobby and pool but, our room itself left a lot to be desired. The upholstery was stained, the furniture was so chipped and scuffed up, it looked like something from a college dorm room and the bed looked like it was thrown together by someone in a big hurry. The noise from the planes was bad enough but, you could also hear every noise in the hallway and every word of conversation in the adjoining room. The balcony had a very partial ocean view but, the main view was of an apartment building next door and some stinky dumpsters. We called the front desk to request a room change and were told not only that we couldn't change rooms but, that this room had been an upgrade! I was so disappointed that we checked out and went elsewhere before we even spent one night. I really wanted to like this hotel because of the Isla Verde location ( I hear it is supposed to be one of the nicest beaches in PR) but, the noise and the poor quality of the rooms was just not worth it. The one thing I can say to this hotel's credit is that the front desk staff was very friendly and they did refund the price of our stay.

It's located on a beautiful beach. The ocean water was still warm enough to swim--in December. The beach access and proximity to the airport are the two best things going for this hotel. Platinum status with Marriott didn't really get me much here. My room had a balcony overlooking the beach. I could've sat out there for hours. The bathroom in my room had a wash cloth draped over shower curtain--I'm assuming from the last guest. The \"clean\" wash cloth next to my sink had a black curly hair in it. Anyone past the age of 9 knows where that probably came from. It would take two seconds for anyone in housekeeping to glance over the towels/cloths/sheets to weed out the previous guests' body hair. Really gross. There is a casino in the lobby. If you're a gambling man you may have heard the term \"Caribbean style\" of blackjack. This is where geniuses split 20s and make other mentally handicapped decisions. That having been said, if you plan on playing blackjack in the casino, don't be surprised when the guy next to you ruins a winning hand. Beautiful beach. Disappointing hotel.

The room was very clean and housekeeping did a great job of cleaning it every day. It had 2 queen size beds, very comfortable. Bathroom was roomy and clean also - water pressure was perfect and warm water (some hotels we've stayed at have issues with too much water pressure or water too hot). Fee for the room included 2 bottles of water per day which was nice to have. There are washer and dryer machines on the 2nd floor which are coin operated. There was an ice cream shop in the lobby area which was great for the kids (we have a 6 year old and 9 year old so this was perfect). The ice cream shop also sold great coffee which we have to have every morning. There is a restaurant lounge which we didn't try but it must have been good because it was always full. There is also a Casino. The pool area was WONDERFUL. There was a separate kiddie pool with a very small slide. You can literally walk from your lounge chair at the pool a few steps and be right on the beach. My kids LOVED both. Hubby and I were able to relax inside the pool at the pool bar with a few drinks while still able to watch the kids in the pool. The beach was super clean and there was jet ski rentals for $60/30 minutes. Complimentary beach lounge chairs and hammocks for hotel guests. Beach sand was a smooth, brown texture where you can walk barefooted (unlike other beaches I've been too that have too many seashells and hurt your feet if you're not wearing beach sandals). The waves were a little strong so definitely had to keep the kids close but safe enough to swim in. This hotel is on Isla Verde which is very touristy but you are close enough to San Juan so you can go check out some local bakeries (Quesitos -- YUMM). Try La Ceiba on Roosevelt or Panaderia Espa\u00c3\u00b1a on Ave. Baldorioty de Castro (take a cab- not within walking distance). I really have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel, there was only one minor thing - the parking garage. You pay for the parking per day so don't loose the ticket that you get the first time - it's what you use to get back in and out. The garage is cramped so be careful turning the corners as you may run into other cars. The visitors to the Casino who are not hotel guests use the same parking garage so it can get difficult to find a parking spot during peak Casino times. I think they should have a separate parking garage for hotel guests only. Or at least they should have a separate floor with card key access for hotel guests only.

Sitting out not he balcony is very noisy from the fans down below from the other part of the hotel so between that and the plains flying over not to relaxing to sit outside. The staff was nice but its hard to enjoy and be happy when allot had gone wrong and it had to be a fight to fix it all. When it was our last day I received a bill under my door that I was not expecting had to call the front desk and find out what it was it was in error. REALLY now a bill of 394.00 that was a mistake really one problem after another. Will I stay again no I let them know that since I stayed in the hotel 2011 to 2012 they have gone down hill and they should work on improving.

Our room was very nice, the bed was comfy, the outdoor pool and beach were gorgeous. The best thing about this hotel resort is the staff! We had many questions for Karla the concierge when we arrived and she did her very best to try and get us a tour of the biobay but it was a full moon and you can't really see the luminescence unless it is dark. She did successfully get us on a tour of the Camuy Caves and Arecibo Observatory (see separate rating). We had a terrific server, JenMarie, our first night at the restaurant, Salsa, in the hotel. You'll know her by her dimpled smile. We asked what Puerto Rican specialties we could have for dinner and she recommended the bean soup and rice, skirt steak with chimichurri sauce or the pork dish with a dipping sauce that we suspect is a combination of ketchup and mayonnaise. She surprised us with an appetizer of Mofongo which is a mashed plantain dish with garlic & oil. It was delicious! Jos\u00c3\u00a9 suggested the bottle of house wine Trio (Chilean) and it went very well with our selections. We loved the soup and the skirt steak was tasty but a bit chewy and stringy since it is a cheaper cut of meat. Andy enjoyed his pork. They served us 2 other variations of plantain but we liked the Mofongo best. Even though we were stuffed and a bit drunk from the wine we let JenMarie and Jos\u00c3\u00a9 talk us into trying the Tembleque, a firm coconut pudding. If you like coconut don't miss trying it! We loved it and asked for it every night we were there. We both enjoyed the Puerto Rican caf\u00c3\u00a9 con leche (strong coffee with hot milk) and it spoiled us before getting to the cruise ship. The next morning we were served by very cheerful, friendly and competent, YoaMara. Even though we didn't show up for breakfast until just before they closed breakfast service she made us feel like honored guests. We also met Angel, the Food and Beverage Manager, and Jes\u00c3\u00b9s, the Food and Beverage Director, as they were preparing the restaurant for lunch service. They obviously love what they do and made us feel very special. I really felt like I was on vacation once I got in the pool and had a drink at the swim up bar. If you like rum you must try the Puerto Rican Ron del Barrilto, either 2 star or 3 star. It is far better than Bacardi. In fact, they make this rum from Bacardi and age it in casks. My husband drinks his rum straight up but I notice the difference in quality even in my Pina Coladas. It is much smoother and complex. The bartenders did not object at all to making my mixed drinks with the better rum. YoaMara even brought us a homemade treat on our second morning for our afternoon snack. It tasted like a yummy bread pudding but we didn't get the chance to ask her what it was called or how it was made. We tried eating off the property at the Metropole down the street on our second night but we liked the food at Salsa on the resort better and ate there on our last night. Lorna the evening manager at the restaurant was pitching in and bussing tables since the restaurant was packed but she made sure she came by to ask us if we enjoyed our meal. It was excellent again and we told her so. The only small downside to this property is that it is adjacent to the airport so you do hear all of the planes taking off when you are outside but our room was well soundproofed and we slept undisturbed.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely return!\u201d", "Author": "anon0423", "ReviewID": "UR126286894", "Content": "We just returned from an eight-day vacation to Puerto Rico and stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde. A word about the negative aspects of certain of the reviews on this site: 1. It is true that the hotel is right by the airport. It is true that there will be airport noise, which we found more prevalent on Sunday than any other day. However, it is also true that the airport noise is intermittent even at its worst (think perhaps two planes per hour, and then only four or five hours of the day), the noise lasts for approximately three minutes, and the sound of the crashing waves more than drowns out the sound. 2. It is also true that the service at the restaurants is extraordinarily slow. I'm not even sure that begins to describe it. But you will quickly find that will be your experience at nearly all Puerto Rican eating establishments - we even suffered through it at the airport on our way back home. The worst part about the restaurants in the resort is that the food is exceptionally so-so. Absolutely nothing to write home about, so if you have to wait for food to be delivered, why not venture out of the hotel and find one of the good local restaurants down the street a short way? 3. Others have noted that, despite the resort fee, nothing is free. That is true and false. Each day, we secured three beach loungers, a table to put drinks, etc., on and a large umbrella to provide respite from the Puerto Rican sun. You will not be so fortunate at some all-inclusives throughout the Caribbean, where hoarders will drape towels over multiple chairs at ungodly times of the morning, so that they can use them once they are really up many hours later. We were also provide beach towels that were actually beach - not bath - towel sized. But beyond that, plan to bring your wallet. The boogie boards were $15 (unless you were lucky enough to snag one of the two or three mini-sized boogie boards). Glasses of soda that are mostly ice will cost you $4 per cup, regardless of whether you fetch them yourself or pop up one of the red plastic flags attached to each chair that cause waitstaff to come bearing menus. 4. Others have noted that the rooms are dark. Our room was in fact a little dark, but only because it was oriented toward the breathtaking balcony view (and we stayed in a run-of-the-house room). With the shades open and the light on by the door, the \"it's too dark\" problem quickly vanished (not to mentioned we used the room primarily for sleeping, where \"it's too dark\" is never a problem). Now, on to the good: 1. The fridge helps. We had breakfast in the room each morning (cereal and milk was not only inexpensive, it was expeditious for the little one who wanted to race outside immediately upon awakening anyway), and made sandwiches, etc., to bring to the beach for lunch. Because it is a public beach, the hotel staff cannot preclude you from bringing your own food and beverages along with you there, even though they can (and do) preclude you from eating it next to the pool. 2. The cleaning staff was very accommodating - once, they even gave us a gallon of water when we were short on bottled water that is provided in the room each day. They gave us more than enough toiletries and towels each day, which can be a challenge at other resorts. 3. The hotel is within walking distance of several really good restaurants (see above re. extremely slow service, which we experienced at each to varying degrees). We enjoyed Metropol and Plato's, as well as Mi Casita (which is in a strip mall, but was so good, we ate there twice). 4. The beach was beautiful and not crowded at all. 5. We had a little trouble with a rental car, which the concierge helped us sort out quickly and without hesitation, even though the trouble had nothing to do with the hotel or its staff. 6. The fitness center was clean, well-maintained, and actually had nice equipment. In all, this is certainly a report worth returning to - the inconveniences are more than made up for by its (relative) affordability.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Danbury, CT", "Title": "\u201cBetter Than Expected\u201d", "Author": "BeachBabe", "ReviewID": "UR126225759", "Content": "I transferred here from the El Conquistador where I attended a wedding.

The only drawback is the hotel is right near a runway and you can hear planes taking off regularly. That is the only reason I would think twice about staying here again.

That is because, as you can tell from all the other reviews, it is directly in the flight path of all the airplanes. The noise is definitely a major factor. However, I found that while lounging in one of the hammocks, the sound of the surf was enough to drown it out. But you can't sleep with your balcony door open to enjoy the sound of the waves, because the first flight of the day will certainly startle you wide awake (if it doesn't give you a heart attack). With the door shut, it's manageable, if not ideal. The beach is the best part of the whole stretch. I made a point of checking the entire sand situation, and at the Ritz, the beach was a mess - with seaweed all over it. The hammocks are divine - and I am an hammock aficionado. There are, of course, not enough of them. But I was always able to get one. Yes, the rooms are dark-ish. But you are at the beach, so why would you be hanging out in your room? At check-in, when I was initially not thrilled about this, the lovely and extremely patient front desk person showed me several other rooms, and I had to admit that she had given me the best of the bunch in the first place. I had a cute little balcony that looked up the beach to the left (I recommend asking for a room with such a view, if you plan on spending any time on your balcony. The other side has parking garage \"views\"). Even the direct ocean view rooms did not impress me. I did think it was odd that a beach hotel would have carpet on the floor, but everything seemed perfectly clean. The small fridge in the room is a giant bonus. You can easily walk to Walgreen's to get snacks and beverages. A longer stroll - but totally feasible - will take you to the supermarket where you will have more options (& slightly better prices). If you will be in the hotel for more than one night, you should take the initiative to get your own supplies. Their drink prices are astronomical and the food is quite average anywhere Marriott fare (& also overpriced). Also, while on your foray, you will locate a couple of local breakfast spots where you can go. Staff is either wonderful or dismal. Some of the concierges were very helpful. Some were disinterested (or not there at all). But I have high praise for the manager (at the time of my stay) whose contact information I got by reading his replies to comments here on TripAdvisor. I had an issue after business hours and sent him an e-mail. His response was immediate and helpful. He is awesome. The only thing I think they should change is a shuttle service. They are only a 2-minute drive from the airport, so why can't they pick you up and take you there? (Maybe there is a law, I don't know. Some airports have weird restrictions regarding on site transportation.) Also, you are far away from the main attraction in Puerto Rico: San Juan. It takes almost 20 a half hour and costs $20 to take a cab there. Then another $20 to get back. There should definitely be a regular shuttle service. There is basically nothing to do in this part of Puerto Rico except for hang out on the beach, or be at the airport, and San Juan is too far away to cab back and forth to more than once a day. All in all, I would stay at this hotel for a day or two at the beginning of a trip to Puerto Rico, and maybe plan to unwind here for one more to have a decent shower before flying home. It's a pick-up spot for the totally amazing EcoTour which would be fun to do before heading off to one of Puerto Rico's other islands for a more relaxing, quiet, and rustic time.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience I have EVER had.\u201d", "Author": "Ryan G", "ReviewID": "UR126118413", "Content": "A little background: There were 4 of us total and we made the reservation on Orbitz for four people.

The only real bummer about this property is that fact that it sits parallel to the take off runway to the airport. But after the first day or two, it didn't really bother us. Great happy hours at the bars but after 6 they are regular price so it gets a little pricey. We hit the Walgreens down the street for room stock which worked out well.

We did take two excursions, Rain Forest (didn't really think it was worth the $65 each for half day) but the Catamaran snorkel trip was fantastic ! Long bus ride to Fajardo but totally worth the day and for $95 each you got the bus to the marina, lunch, all day rum drinks and snorkeling at two reefs.

The best thing about the Marriott's section of the beach is that guests were not seated on top of each other- which seemed to be the case at the Ritz where the beach was packed and there was no room to walk. The room itself was acceptable but the bathroom needed a major update. The cleaning service was adequate but often failed to replace cups and tissues. Thankfully, I didn't spend too much time in my room so this was not a major issue. One of the best features of this hotel is the red flag service which allows guests the comfort of ordering lunch or drinks right from their beach chair. However, be prepared for limited dining options overall and the surrounding area doesn't offer much beyond a Chili's and Denny's. The food itself at the hotel was decent and most of the wait staff was friendly, but not overly attentive. On the nights the hotel had salsa music, the wait for food was far too long (over an hour for a quesadilla) and the waitresses were not particularly nice, focusing on the regular customers and those who were ordering lots of drinks. On the day of my checkout, there was an unexpected charge on my bill. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk, they stated the charge was for a different room and removed it from my bill...without an apology. Make sure to keep track of your room charges. Overall, if you're looking for a quick getaway from the US and plan to spend your days by the beach and pool, this hotel is fine. There is nothing particularly exceptional about it and the location is somewhat isolated. You can probably do better at a different hotel or different part of the island.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Great Value\u201d", "Author": "tawana78", "ReviewID": "UR125139573", "Content": "This is one of three hotels that I stayed at in this area and it is by far my favorite!

We were in a corner room on the 11th floor on the east side, and though we did hear some planes, it by no means hindered our stay at all. The beach was beautiful and clean, the staff was VERY helpful, the small casino had fun slots that kept you there awhile, and the restaurant food was comparable to some of the midpriced restaurants in Texas. We even opted to have our Valentines dinner there, which at Sirena (their beachfront restaurant) was quite lovely. We were very happy that we chose this location which is a tiny bit more remote than the full service Marriott on Condado Beach. Condado is very big city feel and quite congested, and having rented a car and drove to almost all corners of Puerto Rico, we were SO happy not to have to navigate out of Condado every time we wanted to go somewhere. As Americans, we found the driving in PR to be very nervewracking and extremely stressful, as very few laws are abided on the roads. Stay at this Courtyard and you will feel quite relaxed if you choose. If you want a bit of party excitement, though, there is also great salsa music on Friday and Saturday at their bar, Picante.

Among the choices in San Juan, this Courtyard offers a great package for the both the business person or those looking for a relaxing vacation. I usually request a high floor to enjoy the view, and I have been pleased with the rooms where I have stayed (even those with a partial view of the ocean). When I stayed last, I hit the jack pot as I enjoyed a special online package that included a US$50.00 debit card, US$50.00 toward a rental, and free breakfast (I stayed for a five days). The hotel is easily accessible from/to the airport (10 minutes) and, once in the rooms, one hardly hears the airplanes landing or the casino on the first floor of the hotel. The windows have a triple seal of glass that keep the rooms quiet. The beds are very comfortable and the furniture is well kept. Access to the beach and the chance to jog for miles and miles, should not be take from granted as this is one of the few hotels that offer that kind of perk in San Juan. On the business side of things, I can comment: * Excellent wireless connectivity within the room and public areas * The hotel has a set of business rooms, which are ideal for business people. * Rooms are roomy and well organized, the desk is wide as well as with plenty of outlets. * There is a good supply of in-room coffee and tea at all times, for those like me who need to stay late working. * The front desk staff, bell boys, and taxi drivers all are friendly and knowledgeable about the surroundings. The bell boys are always helpful, with a very pleasant personality despite the hour of the day. * The taxi drivers can tell you up front the fares they will change you, but it always good to ask first as taking taxis can usually add up quickly. Overall they are committed to offer a good service or to take you from place to place, if one informs them on time. * The business center is fine and the staff is available when needed. * The check in and check out is always fine, without funny charges. * The gym, which is at walking distance in a separated building, offers a good selection of machines, dumbbells, and cardio machines. It is very good and included at not additional fee. * The hotel is at walking distance, 10 minutes, to a large group of restaurants and additional hotels. It is safe to walk in the area, and prices range according to the taste. CONS - So far I can not think about any major issue that needs to be highlighted, ah! Sure, there is a resort fee that ones need to pay which is not out of proportion.

The hotel is very good, nice beds and nice rooms with balcony, right in the beach of Isla Verde which is beautiful and pleasant (it was hard to find anyone unless near the hotels). The services provided by Courtyard very much pleased me as you have beach towels, chairs and umbrellas without having to pay anything else as already payed (the hotel charges a resort fee that covers that services, wireless internet and two bottles of water per day per room). Knowing how much it is charged for this kind of things in Miami Beach, for example, made me really happy that everything was included in the resort fee (I guess it was around U$ 20,00 per room per day). There was only one thing that did not please me but it was not the hotel's fault, althought I believe that the hotel could manage things in order to avoid this kind of situation with their guests: the overpriced taxi fare that the cab drivers that stop at the hotel charge. I explain: in San Juan when you go by taxi from one place to another you already know how much you are going to pay as there is a flat rate to every place. The taxi drivers that stay at the hotel, in a regular basis, do not obey the fixed rate. They always charge you a bit more. If you walk outside of the hotel you will find taxis that will take you to the place you want to go for the right rate. I complained about that to the manager and I know it is not the hotel's fault but I believe that one call to the company that owns the taxis would put an end to this story. I believe that Courtyard has to protect their guests from this kind of procedure as it is not right at all.

But I had just stayed at the Ritz so I remember feeling like moving to the Marriott was going to be a huge downgrade. Happily, this was not the case. When I checked in, I was greeted by friendly staff and informed that they were providing a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite. It couldn't have been more perfect, as I was staying with a friend/coworker and the setup allowed us to each have our own private space. We were also given free matchplay coupons and some other freebie which I can't remember (maybe a free cocktail? not sure). Our room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, with an excellent ocean view. We had a (full size!) refrigerator, microwave and a quasi-kitchen area with a counter. It was more of a small apartment than a hotel room. The bed was extremely comfortable and my colleague was comfortable on the pull out couch.The only drawback I can think of to the room was that the bathroom didn't have alot of counter space - but it was still more space than the counter in the bathroom at the $700 per night Plaza Hotel in NYC! So I'm not complaining. The beach was gorgeous, clean, not too crowded, and the staff was very helpful in getting you towels, drinks, etc. There is live music/dancing on Saturday nights, and it was really nice! There were locals of all ages dancing, it was a ton of fun. The casino was also lively and the game attendants were friendly. Doesn't hurt that I won some cash too. The only true area of improvement would be with the food options. We came down a little late for dinner and they were offering nothing but buffet in the restaurant. The options didn't look appealing and my colleague is a vegetarian and it was pretty slim pickings for her. The outdoor restaurant was closed a little early. We didn't want to eat in the bar area because it was so loud and crowded (the live music had already started) but we gave it a try. The food at the bar was quite good and the drinks were excellent! The next morning, the breakfast buffet was decent - not the best, not the worst. The waffles were excellent and made fresh. To me, this hotel is the perfect balance between value and amenities. You get beachfront property (Isla Verde is arguably the best beach area in San Juan), a casino, a fitness center, laundromat and a nice bar.

Location is terrible. Next to the airport, we could hear planes taking off and landing - powerful noise of engines and a strong odor of fuel fumes lingering for a while afterwards whether you are on the beach, pool or balcony were very annoying. Money saved on accommodation we spent on transportation to and from the Old San Juan - taxi fare was $21 one way, car rental for one day with a child safety seat came up around $55. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the precious time wasted on formalities (took us 1 hour to get and 30 min to return the car), traffic (awful during the day), finding our way around (use your GPS), and creepy taxi drivers (beware of unlicensed taxi cabs when getting one anywhere other then your hotel, especially at night). 2. Service. We didn't use much service in the hotel. Bell boys were fast, polite and helpful. Cleaning lady made face when I asked her for an extra tea bag. Service at Banana Cafe was very slow. 3. Room. We had a room on the eastern side of the building on the 6th floor. We paid $25 extra for upgrading to the ocean and pool view room as opposed to the western side where you have view of hotels. Not only it was just partial ocean view but the balcony was facing the roof of the hotel's casino and restaurants with many AC units on it working non-stop and producing a lot of noise (on top of the airport noise). Needless to say, we couldn't use our balcony for that reason and even double doors could not prevent the noise from getting into the room. On top of that the receptionist didn't tell us that the room was handicap accessible which was quite inconvenient. The room itself was in a decent condition though the dresser was broken, and was long, narrow, and somewhat dark. The AC unit in the room is very (and I mean VERY) loud. Night rest was not peaceful. Our valuables were safe in the safe deposit box. 4. Pool area is very pleasant. 2 hot tubs. Kid's pool with a slide. The beach was dirty early in the morning - plastic cups, straws, pieces of lime, and some smelly sea grass. 5. Overall. If you are to stay in San Juan for one night and need to get to and from the airport quickly this might be a place of your choice.

First of all, the service I had was exemplary. Every person I dealt with was friendly, efficient, and helpful, not an attitude in sight. As for the value, I give it a four, with a few caveats. If you are paying their listed price, I would give the place a 3 in value, but if you can get a discount like we did where the price was under $100 a night, it was well worth it. You have to keep in mind however, that there is a $15-$20 a night parking fee and another daily resort fee, which I believe was $15 a day. As far as the hotel amenities, there are several places to eat, but I cannot attest to their quality as we ate at local places every night. If you are into convenience and don't mind standard fare, it is probably a bonus. There is also a pool, casino and gym if those are important to you. The location is also a mixed bag. It is nice in that it is literally right on the beach, it is bad because there are sand fleas and it is so close to the airport that you will hear planes all day. Additionally, located in Carolina, it is at the end of the tourist section of Isla Verde, so it will be a moderate walk to get anywhere of interest close, and cab costs will add up for anything farther out like San Juan. I would highly recommend renting a car if you plan on sight seeing at all. As for the rooms, they were decently spacious, the decor was nice, though starting to show signs of wear. It was all in all, nicely apportioned, but not luxurious by any stretch. To sum up, if you can get a deal, it's definitely worth the quality on a budget, but if you're looking for something really nice and you have a little more money, there are nicer places to be had in more convenient locations.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Branford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cThe Marriott is Isla Verde is a great value\u201d", "Author": "Pattihoney", "ReviewID": "UR122470280", "Content": "This Marriott is located at the far end of a lovely beach.

Christina calmly handed us a restaurant pager and motioned the four of us and our eight bags to the luxury-bereft lobby and told us we could expect to wait three to four hours for our suite to be cleaned. Incredulous, we asked if we could downgrade or upgrade so that we could settle in, but, apparently, no other rooms in the hotel were available. I pointed out that the reservation confirmation I received stated that check in-time was listed as 3:00p, and that there was no mention that check-in might be delayed. We were told, again quite calmly, that the previous occupant had selected a late-check-out which meant that we were to have a late check-in. Christina confirmed that Marriott received a late check-out fee from the previous occupant of the suite. I pointed out that this was more than a little fraudulent on the part of Marriott \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel receives a late fee, and then prevents the new occupant from enjoying the suite. With check in time of 3:00p and check out time at noon, we are already paying over $500 for 21 hours. Delaying our enjoyment of the room for four hours meant that we were expected to pay over $500 for 17 hours of room use. Christina tried bravely to follow this logic but failed miserably and fell back on what I assume was a stock answer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every hotel does it this way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dear Marriott, no other hotel has ever done this to me. After one hour of wrangling at the front desk, our suite, Christina announced, was actually ready. Clever strategy, I must admit.

The carpet was new, and it was on the corner, we will give it that. The bell-hop was very helpful too. He held the door open while we unloaded our bags. Then he held his hand out for a tip. The resort itself feels cheap and very short on luxury or opulence. The towel desk closed at 6:00p, essentially closing the beach down and precluding quiet enjoyment of the lingering Caribbean sun. We found all staff seemed to share an undercurrent of resentment. Our only moment of joy, if it can be called that, was the incredibly swift response of the maintenance department when we called to complain about a clogged shower drain. The gentleman who came to deal with our problem appeared less than five minutes after our call, was polite, focused, solved the problem immediately, and even brought us new towels and soap.

The staff is AMAZING and severely accomodating. They made us feel like we were the royal couple getting married. In terms of aesthetics, the lobby is beautiful and has lots of entertainment. The pool area (where the outdoor weddings take place) is nice, and has a beautiful backdrop of the ocean. The rooms are really nice and spacious as well! In terms of downsides, they dont close the pool for weddings, and the beach is public, so there are often additional uninvited spectators for the weddings - for our event we had quite the crowd gather from both the hotel pool and the beach. This made some of our wedding photos interesting (there was one with a gentleman in the speedo in the background). There is also the challenge of the airport being 5 minutes away from the hotel; however this did not present an inconvinience during the wedding, even though I thought it might. The best thing about this Marriott, and the reason why I would highly recomend it to anyone, is because of the staff. They moved mountains for us! Anything that we requested, they found some way to accomodate - which was excellent since we had about 30 guests coming into Puerto Rico from out of town, and another 60 from around the island. They made our event very special and I guarantee it would not have been as successful without them. Special thank you to Michelle Coto, Frances Rivera, and Moraima (Catering Manager). This venue is also convinient in terms of its accesibility for tourism in the island. It is a 5 minute ride from the airport ($11 cab ride generally), and has access to bus stops near by that can take you to Old San Juan without need to rent a car. It has easy access to the beach - located right behind the hotel - and has some fabulous entertainment right in the hotel (salsa at night, and a fairly large casino).

I've stayed up and down the strip and this place is phenomenal. I checked reviews on TA and they were spot on. The staff is super friendly and the front desk girl (forget her name) showed us 2 additional rooms above and beyond our reservation that were only an additional $40 $ $60, respectively. We chose the 11th floor Suite which added $60 but gave views of the mtns, airport & beach which was essentially 180 degrees. For $300, (with the brutal additional tourism tax) I feel it was worth the expense due to the location, amenities & beach front location. They give you 2 rum drink vouchers & 2 casino vouchers which we never used, though they're a plus. The front staff girl stated she would send up a maintenance man to address a light/outlet that was bad that she noted while showing us the room, although he never knocked to rectify it (no big deal). The lobby is great and has 3 restaurants (1 is also the bar & 1 is mainly sweets). We never hit the casino so no comments here. (The El San Juan near by is a much better choice if you're looking for luxury and/or a big casino & the Ponce Hilton Golf Club & Casino is the better choice for business if you're looking for a reasonable, large resort & casino, though this is on the south side of PR.)

It's at the far east end of the Isla Verde beaches which is a bonus since your easterly views are unobstructed looking towards Pinones. For business travelers, I would look no further; and for those looking for a close resort/name brand hotel near the SJU airport, this is your place.

I found it to be different from the typical Courtyard experience. I'm sure they have business travelers stay there, but I found that it was primarily occupied by tourists. The staff consistently went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and assist with whatever we needed. When we checked in and went to our room, there were several staff members working in the room. One of them (Demitrio) greeted us and took care of calling the desk to have them assign us a new room, then he escorted us to our room, made sure that it was in good condition, and had one of the staff from the desk bring up our new keys. I've certainly had the experience of arriving at a room that was not ready, but Demitrio made sure that we did not have to wait for resolution, or try to resolve the problem ourselves. This was a great indicator of the level of service we experienced throughout our stay. The room was clean, and well maintained. We had new carpet in our room, which you could tell from the smell. Our balcony provided a view of the beach and pool area. The bathroom was the only part of the room that showed a bit of wear, but it was very clean and met our needs. The bed was very comfortable, and I am very picky about beds! I found it to be more comfortable than some of the higher level Marriott branded hotels I've previously visited. The pool and beach area were great. In the pool area, there is towel service, a kiddie-pool, hot tub, regular pool with swim up bar, a walk up bar, and an area where you can have table service for a light meal. The pool area was very clean and well attended. Along with towel service, the staff makes sure that you have enough lounge chairs for everyone in your party, either by the pool or on the beach. Another nice touch! We did not take advantage of the casino during our visit, but it is open 24 hours, and is smoke free. In the evenings, there is live music (I'm not sure if this is just on weekends or every night) in the lounge in the lobby (Picante). We enjoyed the hotel breakfast twice during our stay and found it to be delicious and convenient. A bit pricey-- around $15 per person, whether we ate the full breakfast bar on the weekend or ordered from the menu for a weekday breakfast. The hotel is right by the airport, and you definitely can hear the planes pass overhead. When you're inside the room, the sound is muffled, but is still audible, so very noise sensitive people might have a problem. One important thing to note about the plane sound is that it is primarily only during \"normal\" flight times, so it generally does not go on all night. In the Isla Verde area, not far from the hotel, a few minutes by car, and maybe 15 minutes by foot, you can find a huge selection of chain restaurants including fast food and fast casual, as well as other casinos within hotels, and some more authentic restaurants and bars. There is also a grocery store and Walgreens nearby.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bethesda, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable\u201d", "Author": "CYLau", "ReviewID": "UR121659538", "Content": "Rooms are comfortable and clean.

The shape of the room meant you couldn't see the ocean unless you were standing on the balcony. The roof a/c unit was deafeningly loud. Door closed and tv on and we could still hear it loudly. Plus the balcony was wet with a steady stream of water from the floors above. It wasn't even raining. The house band was good and we enjoyed the dancing at night. The pool is small and filled with children most of the time. I wish with a swim up bar they would close off that side to kids since the pool is divided already. Pool bar was fun but had very limited hours. Beach is easily accessible and quite nice. I was thankful for the lounge chairs and umbrella set up by the attendant. Loud planes overhead which is annoying, but that close to the airport it's expected. Parking is . . . I think $25/day. That stinks. Concierge was a joke and I had to wait for her to stop her phone conversation (about 5 min) with her mother. Even then, she was less than helpful. Desk attendant was really nice and very helpful.

But I did request a corner room, so maybe it was my fault that that's what we looked over. The beach was great, staff was extremely attentive to get you chairs, tables, and flags for drinks. I always tipped them. The sand wasn't even hot! The sun is great until about 3:30 when it dips behind the hotel. We went in the pool once and it felt great, and it's open 24 hours which is a plus! Live salsa music most every day both inside and out. I think a lot of locals come to our hotel to dance, some of them were really good. Casino was meh... Kind of small, not too much excitement. We played blackjack there several nights. They have three restaurants in the hotel, all of which are a tad overpriced but decent for a 2am meal. That was the only drawback to this hotel- because it's the last one in the string of Isla Verde hotels there isn't anything within walking distance. When we took a cab a few minutes West, all of the hotels had local flavor right across the street. Our last two mornings we were woken by hammering, I guess they were putting new carpet in the floor directly above us (at 9am), which was rather irritating.

I stayed here on business, visiting a company that has a location in Carolina, PR, not realizing that Carolina is the center of the \"Isla Verde\" resort area, and I had a much bigger selection of hotels. Touching down from the airplane, I saw the pink building in which I would be staying and immediately started dreading the trip. Upon arriving, I realized that this was not the typical Marriott Courtyard to which I am accustomed. It has a much less business traveler feel, with the casino, restaurants, and lobby bar. I spent the first morning there preparing for the next day's meeting, but used the afternoon to explore and enjoy the beach/pool/pool bar. The hotel is located on the same beach strip as all of the other resort hotels (El San Juan, El Conquistador, etc.), so the beach is exactly the same as these luxury resorts. Service - both beach service and at the pool - was great, I can't say it's the same over-the-top service that you receive at a truly luxury resort, but it was fantastic for a business trip. The rooms are exactly the same as at every Marriott Courtyard. Marble vanities in the bathrooms (whoever said it was fake is mistaken), flat screen tvs and mostly updated furnishings are in the room. The casino is much smaller than at many other resorts (and obviously Vegas casinos), but it served its purpose if you had any interest in playing table games or slots. I went to both of the restaurants during the course of my trip and they weren't great (full disclosure - I'm from NYC), so I would recommend visiting some of the more authentic restaurants along the main avenue, or - if you have a car - the restaurants in Old San Juan (although I was here during Mother's Day and the place was FULL of locals, with a 2+ hr wait, so some people must find the food good). I have also stayed at the El San Juan years ago, and while that is obviously a much higher-end resort, I found the Marriott to appear newer, with the beach and pool to be comparable.

I am sure that I was given one of the least desirable rooms (location) because I was paying with an airline voucher. I was on the second floor with a view of the lobby/restaurant roofs. I would highly recommend getting a high floor, if you stay here. The hotel is on a busy street. The rooms are closer to those you would find in a older Marriott (not courtyard). They were clean, had free internet, and a flat screen TV. I think the standards are a little lower for the courtyard brand as far as the bathroom goes. It was a little dated, but not bad. It had that fake marble counter and an older faucet. Other than that the room was up to date. It is on the beach and has a pool. I did not use either. I was tired from my airport activities. The feel of the lobby is really interesting. Some people are in nice dress outfits and others are in sloppy beach attire. There are also a lot of locals who were in the lobby bar. This may have been because the band that was playing in the Picante bar/ lounge. I overheard a couple next to me saying that they were here to go on a cruise. I asked if many people come here the night before or after their cruise and she said that many come a few days before or stay a few days after. Honestly, for a few days \"vacation\", I don't think this hotel would be my choice. A few days on business would be fine though. I would even stay here overnight before or after taking a cruise.

I used Marriott reward points for this stay and had requested a non smoking, high floor room with a king bed. All of my requests were honored. The hotel rooms need some updating, but for the most part my room was clean. My complaint with the hotel is that I was unable to get hot water for my showers. I could never get any water that was warm enough for my comfort and I was actually cold taking a shower. Another area that needs improvement are the pillows. The pillows in my room were the worst I have ever had in a hotel room. They were very low quality and uncomfortable. A refrigerator in the room was supplied with 2 bottles of water and there was coffee and tea in the room which was nice. The balcony had a fabulous view of the beach and ocean and a small table and chairs to sit outside. The drawback to the balcony is that there is a large vent that blows out hot air directly at the table and chairs. Shortly after check in I made my way down to the pool area and beach. There were lots of people of all ages and lots of families with children. I did not care for the pool area in person, they make it look much nicer in the hotel photos. Also, if you are someone who likes sun, the pool is very shaded in the afternoon. The beach is huge and you can take a long walk up and down the beach if you want to. The sand quality is average and hard for me to be excited about after vacationing in the Virgin Islands. There is no comparing a Puerto Rican beach to those in the USVI - they just don't measure up. The water clarity is not good. The location of this hotel is extremely noisy and for me would not be my idea of a relaxiing vacation. All you hear constantly all day long and into the night is the roar of jets taking off and landing at the airport less than a mile away. In addition, the hotel lobby bar plays loud, obnoixious Salsa music for hours on end. It is so loud that practically had to yell out what I wanted to drink from the bartender and he still could barely hear me.

The bed was super comfortable and everyone who worked there was really nice and friendly. The decor of the hotel wasn't stunning, but they seemed to be doing a lot of renovation while we were there, so maybe the hotel will be even nicer in the future. The grounds were lovely- huge pool and gorgeous beach. The guys on the beach were great and set up our chairs and umbrellas cheerfully and promptly. It was super quiet when we were there- the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get busy until Friday and Saturday nights. It seemed like a lot of locals came to the hotel for the live salsa band. There were definitely a few families at this hotel which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a fan of, but the kids seemed mostly confined to the pool area. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try any of the restaurants, but we did have ice cream (mmmm Ben and Jerry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chunky monkey!!) and lattes at Bananas and they were great. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find Puerto Rico cheap- prices were very similar to NYC. A few tips: -there are plenty of Walgreens and supermarkets outside the hotel on the main strip. We would buy our own beer and bring it down to the beach in an ice bucket. It seemed like quite a few people did this. It was also nice to have beers out on the terrace. -the bus to old san juan is efficient enough (bring quarters). It takes about twice as long, but saves a lot when you keep going in and out. Stops in front of Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Only downside- service ends at 9PM. -the excursions cost a lot for what they are. We rented a car to get to El Yunque one day and it was the best decision! Super easy to get to and it was nice to spend the day there on our own time. A car was $33 for 24 hours- about half of what the tour cost for one person. With the car we were also able to drive to Los Pinones- a less touristy area past Isla Verde. We got food and beers on the side of the road and there was a lovely beach there. It was definitely a cool experience to see a different side of PR. We also used the car to drive into Old San Juan- parking in a garage was $3 after 6PM. -for the days you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to travel to Old San Juan there are some places within walking distance of the hotel. Metropol was a nice PR restaurant with typical (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not an expert though) PR food. 101 sports bar (right next to the ritz) was awesome! Very American bar, but beers were cheap, wings were good and they had a jukebox=) My boyfriend was able to watch football there one Sunday and was very happy. Also- although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little further, try Espana. Amazing sandwiches and soup and TONS of pastries (yummy tres leches cake, something I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never had before\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the options were endless there!!). Really local spot, we went there twice for lunch. Brush up on your basic Espanol though! All in all the Courtyard Marriott was a great hotel for a great price.

We visited the other hotels in the area (Ritz, El San Juan) and they were gorgeous but they seemed really stuffy. Marriott is definitely more down to earth and easygoing. Again, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not super luxurious or a resort you could spend 24/7 at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but why would you want to in PR?!

Terry the bartender is exceptional and I apologize, we had a server at breakfast who was very accomodating to me. I wanted just a grapefruit and coffee and he was able to get a grapefruit from the kitchen and charged me a very reasonable and fair price. BTW the grapefruit was not available on the menu, but I asked and they were able to accomodate me. So nice! We also ate at the outside restaurant for dinner. It was also very nice and the server out there (can't remember her name either) she was very helpful and nice. I have invisalign braces and I forgot my container so I put them inside a napkin while I was eating. Of course I forgot them when I left and it was a while before I remembered. When I returned I learned she had found them and set them aside for my return. She also cautioned me to clean them before I put them back in, which of course I was going to do, but it was a thoughtful gesture. I have more examples of the great employees, but hopefully you get the picture. Another thing about this hotel is it is a hot spot for locals to dance on the weekends. The lobby is full of energy on weekend evenings and so if you like to dance the salsa or to watch others dancing the salsa (some we swear are professionals or should be), this is the place for you. Just sit at the lobby bar and enjoy. We stayed at the Ritz in February and while that hotel is much nicer (it's the Ritz people), this hotel is very nice and the service is, in my opinion on par with the Ritz. As far as an affordable hotels go, Marriott Courtyard in Isla Verde is the best. Two restaurants I would highly recommend (and it's a short walk to both): Metropol, which has Puerto Rican and Cuban food is excellent. We have eaten there twice and both times the food was wonderful. Lot's of locals eat there. Don't miss this one. The other restaurant is a little further down the road from Metropol but on the same side of the street as the hotel. It's called Don Jose and looks to be a cheap cafe kinda place. It advertises American breakfast, so we looked at it one night and decided against it (don't want to eat American food when we are in another country, we want to eat their food). Anyway a friend who is from there took my husband and another friend back the following day for lunch and they could not stop raving about the soup. And these are not soup kinda guys. The next day we flew out so I have not had my chance to try the soup, but based on their response I feel very comfortable recommending it. We also went to Guavate (a town about 30 minutes outside San Juan) for lunch. If you like pork and are a bit of an adventurous eater, this is the place for you. They have a street called \"Pork Alley\" and it has many lechoneras (roadside cafes (lechon is roast pork). They roast the whole pig, so if you don't like to see where your meal comes from this is not the place for you. However, you will not find a better place for roast pork anywhere. Just know, this is not a place a lot of tourists go, so you may need a translator. And even though a lot of tourists don't go there, I always felt safe, it's not a scary place at all and would feel very comfortable bringing my young son along. The other upside is that you will get a great meal for cheap. It's an experience if you want to see some of the real Puerto Rico. We toured Old San Juan on one day it was interesting and nice. I think enough others have reviewed that I won't spend time repeating their reviews.

I typically eat at the other local restaurants. Beware of the typical high hotel prices along the hotel row. $26.00 for a mini-burger at Hotel El San Juan (Hilton property) The Ritz Carlton (Marriot property) a block away if that...

My now husband and I decided to hold our ceremony and reception at the Courtyard Isla Verde in San Juan Puerto Rico for several reasons. Chief among them was the fact that they offered reasonable packages and what I knew to be a picturesque beach location. We also chose Puerto Rico because of the ease in which US citizens could travel to the island without a passport. The hotel itself is located near the airport and while you can hear an occasional plane pass overhead it was never intrusive or disruptive. The hotel is located in an area in which we felt comfortable walking. We walked to dinner at a nearby oceanfront restaurant, La Playacita, one night and walked to breakfast near the hotel on another occasion. In talking with one of their staff one morning, we learned that the Hotel conveniently located on a bus route. This allowed up to ride the bus to Old San Juan as opposed to taking a taxi which would have cost approximately $20. We paid .75 cents to ride down to old San Juan were we spent the day sight seeing and having an all around good time. As for our ceremony\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. Unfortunately, mother nature decided to rain on the day of our wedding. I was told that this brings good luck, so I tried not to be to bummed out about it. However, the rain caused a change in ceremony and reception location that NO BRIDE wants to hear about on the day of her wedding. Michelle Cotto, the Event Manager at this Hotel assured me that everything would be okay, AND IT WAS!!!!! We ended up having both the ceremony and reception in the area that normally houses the Sirena restaurant and IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. The rain stopped right before the ceremony began and the sunset was beautiful. My guest commented on how elegant and beautiful the ceremony was and I could not have been happier. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had several guest tell me how good the food was and how much they enjoyed our wedding. The whole thing was a blur to me, but luckily, I have pictures I will treasure for a lifetime. One note of caution, if you plan to have an evening ceremony on the beach, please, please, please, spray yourself before hand to avoid being bitten by any bugs. The Hotel offers complimentary bug spray and those who used it fared better than others. While not everyone was bitten, there were some who noticed bites upon their arrival home. However, this should not dissuade anyone from getting married on the beach in Puerto Rico and getting married at this wonderful hotel. I've had several people tell me they can't wait to go back. The staff was extremely helpful!!!!!!, courteous and knowledgeable. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and wanted to get the word out to future brides to look into this Hotel for your wedding location.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jasper", "Title": "\u201cOkay hotel, but I have stayed in better.\u201d", "Author": "chrisandbeth7508", "ReviewID": "UR115553222", "Content": "My room wasn't as clean as it could have been, and I didn't get shampoo and conditioner everynight like I should have.

I was a little leery of going on vacation by myself, but not leery enough because I went anyway. This was my first time visiting Puerto Rico. I had such a fantastic time at this hotel and I met some really great people on this vacation. The hotel has some pros and cons. More pros than cons. Although I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend too much time in my room, it was clean and comfortable. I slept very well. I had a view of the beach from the balcony, and it was fantastic. The beach outside of the hotel is wonderful. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean, serene and safe. Nothing beats swinging in a hammock on the beach as the sun beats down on you. The beach was not crowded at all, it was lovely and peaceful. The pool area is also clean and not crowded. With the hotel begin able to house so many people you would think it would be crowded, but it was wonderful. The water temperature in the pool also won me over, because it was comfortable. I never understood why some places keep the pool water so cold that you have to work your way into the water, but the pool water temp was perfect. I would stay at the beach until 3pm when happy hour begins at the pool bar (Papaya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s). I would order whatever was the happy hour special for the day (The drinks are $3. Happy hour from 3pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5pm) and then you can go to the bar inside the hotel and continue my happy hour there (Picante. Happy hour from 5pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7pm). I only ate at the hotel once on my first night because I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too sure if I should venture outside of the hotel in the dark, but the next night I walked about 10 minutes and had dinner at Spice. It was delicious. The food at the hotel is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6eh. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t horrible, but after the first night I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to eat there again. Who knows, maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I also ate at a bar called 101, tasty food, even though it is a bar. There is a juke box I heard Pinones was good, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry I never made it there. But being a solo traveler I stuck to walking in the same direction every day. I had breakfast at Dennys, which was a short walk from the hotel and much less expensive. There is a Walgreens right next to Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is great, because you can stock your room with water, snacks and whatever else you might need to lessen the cost of your trip. There is a bus, the T5, that stops outside of the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $.75 cents. The last stop on the bus is also the first stop to bring you back to the hotel, so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get lost. The last stop will take you to the beginning of Old San Juan. I had booked the Old San Juan tour in the hotel, which was cancelled for some reason (a blessing in disguise) and I got to visit Old San Juan for the lesser cost. There is a free trolley that takes you from where the T5 leaves you, through Old San Juan, but if you are not afraid of walking, you will get a better view of the city on your feet, plus, there are two trolleys making the journey and a lot of traffic so you could end up waiting an hour for the trolley. Not worth it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c time is precious when you are on vacation. Old San Juan is only a 3 minute walk up a hill and you are in the city. Everything is recognizable so you cannot get lost. Back to the hotel, the only con I have about the hotel is the government taxes and fees. There is a resort fee, I knew about that, but the resort fee charge is also taxed by the government. So on top of the $11 you will pay a day in resort fees, there is $11 a day that you will pay in additional taxes. AND don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge anything to your room because those taxes will be added on to whatever you charge to the room. Pay cash or use your credit card. Other than that, I had a fantastic time and as someone who gets bored after a few days and wants to come home, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to go back to PR and I will definitely be staying at the Courtyard by Marriott again!!

Bad: -Rooms can be a million times cleaner. They definitely need to renovated. The maids didn't really vacuum or change the sheets. They just made the bed. After a week of sleeping on the sheets it felt dirty. I almost wanted to mess up the sheets in hopes that they would put new sheets on. They also like to do this whole eco thing with saving the towels of which are dirty and which are clean, but I didn't know not cleaning is a new environmentally friendly trend. Also they don't clean the filters on the air conditioning. It was giving this mustly recycled air feeling. Multiple members of my family weren't feeling well. -The service was friendly but sort of slow. I know I know we're on vacation, but sometimes the wait was a little ridiculous. The staff was definitely stretched a little thin. The service would be better if there were more people helping. -Casino was dirty. And not enough waiters. Also the lighting was so dark. If they just made it brighter it would be significantly better. -Swimming pool needs to be cleaner. So many people go in and out of that pool its gross whats in it.

I found out later that was not true and ended up with the room I wanted. It all turned out fine, but was a big hassle. Ok, on to the review of the hotel. The beach is fantastic, no comlaints here. It is sandy and gorgeous. The rooms are a bit dated, but good enough for me. The food at the hotel is overpriced and not very good. I did only eat at the breakfast buttet and grabbed a Pizza from the quick eats area. The breakfast was ok. I asked for a waffle and the guy put one in there but after about 15 minutes he left and I guess he forgot about it. The omelet station was acceptable and the fruit was good. For $15 its a bit expensive, but it was convenient. I didn't eat much at the hotel so I can't review much. The pool isn't very big, but did the job for me. I've been to other places that blow the pool area of this hotel away for a lesser price. Hotel service was fine. I didn't have any problems at all. One thing to keep in mind is this is Puerto Rico and they are not very prompt or in a hurry. I was woken up one night from some party going on. I was too tired to compain about it, it must have been 4am. The one bright note of this place is there are no rooms near the pool or loud areas of the hotel. That means the pool is open 24hrs.

I used to work for Marriott, so I still have some friends that work within the company and was able to get the Friends and Family rate for my room & my parents room.

The bus goes to the bus station which is where you need to get off, so relax and enjoy the scenery on the way. You can then take a ferry for 50 cents to Catano and go on the Bacardi Rum Tour. You get two free drinks, and cheap liqour in their gift shop. A lieter is about $12.75, and the stores around here it would be alot more expensive.

Many had very mixed reviews. The Courtyard by Marriott Isla Verde was the only hotel that had all excellent reviews. So, I went online and booked a week and used my Marriott Rewards card and got a discount on the rate. I reserved it with my credit card and then called the hotel directly and asked if I could pay cash upon arrival. (I don't incur debt on credit cards and prefer to pay cash, but many resorts want your credit card so they can nickel and dime you to death. If you want to pay cash, many hotels want a huge cash deposit to rip you off...) The lady said it was no problem to pay cash and there was no cash deposit required. I already had a good feeling about the hotel. We flew into the airport at dusk and took a short cab ride to the hotel. The hotel doesn't have a shuttle, which it should. Upon arrival we were greeted by the nicest, most courteous and professional hotel staff I've ever encountered, especially Hector, the front desk man. He was gracious and confirmed I could prepay the entire week in cash. He accepted my money discreetly and confirmed that there would be no deposit required. Our hotel room was perfect, facing west, overlooking the beach and the other hotels and condos on Isla Verde. We went downstairs to eat at Sirena, the restaurant outside on the beach. The atmosphere was superb and the wait staff was solicitious and perfect. They didn't hover and bother, but appeared miraculously whenever I needed something. The food was good, but bland. My wife and I like local foods when we travel. The inside restaurant is called Salsa and it has American breakfast buffet in the morning and semi-Puerto Rican dinner. Again, the food was good but bland. What was not bland was the marvelous Salsa bar off of the lobby. The live salsa music on the weekends was superb and the place was crowded and we enjoyed salsa dancing the nights away. The casino off the lobby is great, too. We gambled only a little, but we felt welcome and appreciated and no pit bosses hovered over us when we were winning, as is common in other casinos. The beach staff was courteous and solicitous, making sure we had beach chairs and umbrellas whenever we needed them. The pool and hot tub were perfect, but the hot tub had temperature problems, and was under-heated on occasion. The beach was clean and the entire experience was superb. The entire stay our housekeeper kept our room tidy and was responsive to any need we had. The business center was small and only two computers, but we weren't there to work. We did not use the fitness center, but it was busy all of the time. There is one caveat to this hotel: The Courtyard Isla Verde is across the street from the airport. During the day, flights take off overhead and it's noisy. There are no flights at night so there is no jet noise. If you're addled by jets flying overhead, you won't like the daytime.

So who got the bright idea to put the airport so close to the beach? Of course the beach will be the main attraction for many hotels so this was the best spot for the airport? Having said that, the hotel was very nice, the rooms spacious enough and the beds comfortable. We had an oceanview room overlooking the pool. Our assessment of the property is that no oceanview rooms have a great view unless you are on the top floors as the pool view overlooks the roof of the restaurant and the other side of the hotel has another building very close. We were on floor 6 and were only there for 2 days pre-cruise so it was perfect. The pool was huge and very clean. The hot tub was extremely hot one day, almost too hot to go in, but that evening the temp had been lowered which made it very comfortable. The beach is beautiful and well kept but the biggest attraction in our opinion was the wonderful hammocks on the beach! Contrary to what we had heard they were not often occupied so getting one was not a big issue. They were roomy and very comfortable. The staff was pleasant and accomodating. We arrived hungry the first day and after cruising the lobby for a place to eat and not finding anything that interested us at that moment we ventured out of the hotel to see what we could find. As we passed by the taxi stand we noticed several taxi drivers eating from styrofoam containers. As we approached the street we noticed a woman serving food from her vehicle. What a treat! The food was tasty and inexpensive and plenty of it to feed 2 hungry adults. We could not locate her the next day but I had always heard the local food is the best and the street vendors if you can find a good one, are a real treat. As we did not speak Spanish and she did not speak English we could not find out how often she visits the various establishments but we sure missed her the next day. Bananas in the lobby of the hotel is also very nice for a quick bite to eat. We didn't spend much time off the hotel property as we were only there 2 days to get a jump start on our vacation and only wanted R & R. As for the airplane noise it was bad only if the huge jets were taking off and then the noise was deafening but only for a few seconds. The smaller planes were almost not noticeable.

The Courtyard by Marriott is not a bad hotel, it's a bad value. This hotel would be acceptable for an average nightly rate between $140-180, but we paid $260 a night and for that amount, it was a not a good value. Personally, I am not a gambler and find the presence of a casino about as unappealing as having a strip joint on the premises, but that's a very personal and rather specific issue so I didn't fault this location for that. Most large hotels in San Juan have casinos, but there were specific issues with this hotel related to the casino. Unlike the Ritz and El San Juan next door, there was so separate entrance/parking for the casino patrons, making it difficult to park on the weekend when the casino was busy. The rooms are super outdated, which would be fine, if they didn't cost so much. We had a VCR in our room and the fridge was a 'cooler' that did not really keep perishables fresh. I must say the beds were very comfortable and the double glass doors kept a great deal of the airport noise out. We did sleep well in this hotel, save for the presence of some sort of bugs in the room, I am not sure if it was bed bugs or fleas but my husband and I both woke up itchy and bitten. The partial ocean view room balcony is nice to sit and watch the sunset and enjoy a beer (bought off property), but a better bet are the hammocks down by the beach which were my single favorite feature at this hotel. This property is in Isla Verde adjacent to the Ritz and a few feet from the El San Juan. The Marriot happens to have the best stretch of beach compared with the other hotels in the are and the public beach next to the hotel is also very nice. For are more 'authentic' Puerto Rican beach going experience, guests can walk down to the beach and sample some food from the \"Kioskos\" including BBQ and fried delights. The pool was extremely disappointing. It was cold, dirty and small. We only popped in once and did not return again. Luckily the stretch of beach in front of the hotel is great, which we enjoyed. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel but did purchase drinks from the bar while at the beach. The drinks were expensive/weak but in keeping with the standard resort fare in the region, sticking to beer is a better value. The 'Banana' Cafe makes an excellent cafe con leche but it is pretty pricy at $4 a cup, but nothing out of the ordinary for a resort. None of the the other restaurants seemed appealing enough for us to try, the crowd at the casino was not really our scene. We were on a road trip through Puerto Rico and this is an easy driving location, parking was expensive at $15 and often difficult on the weekends, cab to the airport was $15 despite the proximity of the hotel to the airport. Condado was $15 one night and $17 a different night. Old San Juan was $20. (We didn't drive at night in order to avoid driving after drinking). I didn't recommend this hotel because I wouldn't stay here again for the price. In all fairness I don't think I'd stay at an Isla Verde resort again because I just enjoyed other areas of San Juan more, despite the amazing beach. I think this hotel can be nice for families or college students interested in several late night establishments right off the resort, it just wasn't for us. The staff is generally friendly, although the person who checked us in wasn't very nice and was rude about us having booked through Priceline. We had good service at Cafe Banana except on Monday, March 28th AM when a very young barista could not figure out our order, told us the coffee at the continental breakfast was 'free.' It just seemed like she was more interested in talking to the other person behind the counter instead of making us what we wanted. Other than that the staff was fine, nothing extraordinary. In conclusion, if you are only worried about the airport noise, don't worry, the ocean is amazing and after a while you don't even notice the planes. If you are looking for something stylish, upscale, luxury, this isn't it. In retrospect we should have either paid a few dollars more and stayed some place nicer, or paid a lot less for a cheaper place.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cIncredibly Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "Padge9281", "ReviewID": "UR101382475", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay and would certainly go again.

On previous visits to San Juan I've stayed in Condado, but this time I wanted something beachfront and thought I'd give Isla Verde a try. This is a lovely property, but unfortunately I would not be able to recommend it. The pros: beachfront location, friendly staff, clean & spacious rooms, plenty of dining options and a great live music scene Wednesday through Sunday nights The cons: the walls are paper-thin; lots of people on this site complained about the sound of the airplanes, but for me it was the interior noise that was really a problem. All the doors slam shut, and I could hear everything that was dropped on the floor of the room above me. The people next door were some loud frat boys one night, and then a group of southerners with children a couple days later, and I was privy to all of their conversations. I could even hear someone yawn. You know the walls are thin when you can hear someone yawn. Between the noise and the bed that was much too soft for my taste, it was a pretty sleepless trip. It's a shame, because otherwise it was really nice property. As others have noted, there are hefty \"resort fees\" attached, so make sure you're really going to use all of the amenities of the property before you decide to book. It doesn't make sense to pay for something you're not going to take advantage of. And if you don't rent a car, be prepared to shell out a lot of cash for cabs. A one-way trip to San Juan Vieja is about $20, but you can walk down the street and catch the city bus for 75 cents. There's not a lot within walking distance, so you can feel a bit isolated. Further down in Isla Verde there are other hotels with more stores and restaurants nearby, but if you really want to just be able to walk around and have lots of choices, Condado is your best bet. I'll be staying there for my next trip, but I'll definitely come back to the Courtyard when they have live music. They had great bands playing salsa, merengue, bachata and boleros. I met some locals who like to come there to dance, which is always a good sign. The lobby area was packed when the bands were there, which was in stark contrast to Monday and Tuesday, when it was dead as a doornail. Again, I went to Condado for some signs of life. One last thing. If you're like me, and you feel like you haven't arrived in PR until you hear the coqui, this definitely isn't your spot.

The resort is the last one on the strip as well, which means if you walk down the beach to the right, it's virtually empty. Having the casino was nice, and their Picante bar with Salsa dancing gets pretty busy on the weekends. About a quarter mile walk down the street there are many places to eat and a walgreens to get some snacks. We really enjoyed walking into town each night. The hamocks on the beach are also very nice. Cons: It is literally right by the airport. It can be very loud at times, but all in all, it wasn't that big of a deal. Drinks and food are very expensive at the hotel. I highly suggest going somewhere else for dinner (Spice down the street was amazing. So is La Playita if you are not in a rush). Also-- one of the nicest things about this hotel... Free internet!

The food at the Banana Cafe and the pool side bar I found to be priced well. You could get a burger or chicken for about $10 which is good for a resort.

We found it much less attractive than many reviewers on this site. Starting with the positives, the high end restaurant (Sirena) was very good with excellent service and food presentation. The hotel and rooms were clean and reasonably modern as one expects at a Marriott, but the room was not very large. The beach and pool areas seemed pleasant enough, although we did not use them much (others obviously might find these more important). Now the downsides. Perhaps we were unlucky, but check-in was very slow with several people ahead having apparent problems with their reservations. Other service was good. The view from the room's small balcony looking to the right out over the beach was fine as long as you didn't look left to the rundown high rise apartment building next door that looked to be close to demolition status, or down to the a/c, generators and other miscellaneous junk and debris below. The hotel is literally yards away from the airport runway and the noise level on the balcony as jets revved engines for takeoff was truly deafening. Having double doors kept the the noise level in the room to something more reasonable but it could disturb a light sleeper since take-offs continue all night. Overall the hotel seriously lacks ambience and charm, is poorly located apart from the beach, and has only modest characteristics of a resort. It is not a place I would want to do more than spend an overnight near the airport (and for that the Hampton Inn is better value). The price, of course, is quite high and it does not provide a particularly impressive overall value. The price is even less acceptable because of the Puerto Rican intent to aggressively soak tourists, not only with a hotel tax of about 12% but also by adding a daily \"resort tax\" of $33 making $65 in taxes for one night! Finally, there is no airport shuttle (I haven't found any hotel that has one there) - obviously the taxi drivers have excellent political connections in San Juan and want their cut too. Oh yes, and the slots in the casino seemed pretty tight.

The rooms were cleaned promptly every day, receptionists were polite friendly and helpful. It was great to have the live bands each night and insight into local night life. I was particularly fascinated by all the salsa dancing by local families of all ages. I really enjoyed the buffet breakfast especially the fresh omelettes that are made as you wait. But best of all the view and ambience by the beach as you have breakfast was brilliant. I had the opportunity to visit someone who was staying at the Ritz Carlton on the same beach. I am very happy to report that Courtyard beach area & sand is much better and the environment is better. Even my room in terms of value for money was easily comparable if not better than the Ritz Carlton. There were plumbing issues on my last night when I got back to the hotel at around 2am. I called reception and immediately a plumber came and resolved the issue and cleaner came and mopped up. So even though there was a slight problem it was resolved very quickly, what more can you ask for? Seems a pity that the Bar in the pool & the pool area seem underutilized and closes early! I guess it is because of lack of use but the fact that it closes early might be why it is under utilized Previous reviewers have complained about plane noise. Personally it was not a problem at all.

The location of the hotel is really what made us decide to stay here. The views on the beach are really beautiful and they do a really good job at keeping the common areas clean, especially around the pool and in the lobby. Besides that, we really weren't that impressed. We decided to eat dinner at Picante (one the restaurants inside the lobby) and were shocked at how expensive things were. We split a $14 plate of chicken nachos with cheese that looked, and tasted, like it came straight from the jar. We also ended up talking to the Tours and Excursions desk about visiting Old San Juan. The lady tried telling us that the only to get there was a $20 taxi, each way. We discovered by asking a lady at the bus stop, if you walk up to the bus stop in front of the Denny's the 53 or the 5 (or T5) will take you there for 75 cents and runs every 30 min or so. I don't think the buses take dollar bills so make sure you bring some change. Also, I recommend taking the 53, it goes through a nicer part of town and sticks closer to the beach. The noise in the hotel was a little more than I expected. Just by walking down the hall I could hear conversations in the rooms we were walking by. Also, since the hotel is right next to the airport we heard planes taking off all night. The room wasn't horrible, but it was a little dirty. It seems that if a vacuum can't reach it, it won't get cleaned. So just don't look in the corners or under the bed. Also, the paint looks pretty old on the walls, especially in the bathroom, so it makes the place look older than it actually is. I read some complaints about mold in the bathrooms, but didn't notice any myself. I did notice that there was some garbage behind the toilet that had been left by a previous guest, apparently left unnoticed by the cleaning staff. Overall, we enjoyed out stay, just be aware that you are staying in a tourist part of the city and they try to take advantage of you for that. It is only a 5-10 minute walk up the street to find some local restaurants that aren't as expensive and a Walgreens where you can buy your water or beer.

Literally a 5 minute taxi drive from the San Juan airport, is this wonderfully laid-back resort is situated directly on a stunning streach of beach. It has most of the amenities of a large resort without the crowds and pretention. The swimming pools were a perfect temperature, with a swim-up bar. Lounge chairs,palm trees, and food/beverage service at the pool and the beach. Umbrellas at the beach upon request. Several convenient dining options on premises- more within an easy walking distance, as well as a Walgreens and (overpriced) liquor store. We decided not to rent a car, and were happy about that. There is plenty of public transportation- taxis and busses. A car would be handy for day trips, but we enjoyed the resort so much that we didn't feel the need to tour much. We only had 4 days. We took a taxi to Old San Juan.-$19. Busses are also available if you have the time. The taxi fares are regulated from the airport, and you are told what the fare will be before you get in. It was $10 plus $1 for my suitcase. I joined my friend at the resort. First time in PR. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice everyone was to us. We also felt very safe. (Two females) walked the beach and neighborhood at night without a worry. During our entire trip we never encounterd beggars or peddlers, on the beach or anywhere else. That was a nice change from other island I have been to. The hotel is right on the beach. The beach, the pools, and the restaurants all flow into eachother. That was great. The nightlife at the hotel is fantastic. Especially Friday and Sat nights. There are really good latin bands playing, and hords of locals come to dance salsa. It was so much fun to watch. There is a casino there, but I can't comment on that, as I know nothing about casinos. The bar, lobby, and casino are all open to eachother, and the place was hopping when I went up to my room at 1:30 a.m. To sum it up, I think this hotel offers a great value if you are willing to overlook the sounds of an occasional jet taking off and landing in clear earshot. You only notice it at the beach and pool, which are so lovely, that it is easy to forgive the intrusion of an occasional sonic boom. The rooms are very quiet. Close the double sliding glass patio doors, and you won't hear a thing from inside or outside the hotel. If you like the beach, you will like this place. If you like to relax, you will like this place. If you like Salsa music, you will really like this place. It might be a little boring for older kids and teens, as it seems more geared to adults. There are, however, kiddie pools for the very young. We love good food, and were not impressed with anyplace we ate, no matter the cost. Everything seemed very dry- fish, pork, chicken. Rice and beans were better. For convenience on our first night, we ate at Serena's at the hotel. It had a lovely atmosphere in a beachside setting, but the food was expensive, and our fish was so dry. I didn't think it was worth it. You can sit at those same tables during the day for free. We ate dinner at the Metropole 2 nights. It is walking distance from the hotel- a local spot. The food was OK there, also dry, but 1/3 of the price. Another night we went to an expensive tapas place in the old city that all the guide books recommend, and thought it was a rip-off. The worst paella I ever had. Basically $28 for a plate of rice with a few bits of seafood in it. My advise- eat cheep. The expensive places aren't any better. We did have lunch at the pool-side grill 2 days for convenience, and that was nice. I liked the fact that there were convenient dining options on site, as well as others to walk to. If you vacation in this area, be prepared with bug spray, and/or some kind of anti-itch cream, or antihistimine. I got bitten badly by the no-see-ums at the beach.

It is literally right across the street from the airport runway. It turned out this was a not a big deal at all.

At check in they did offer to upgrade us at no charge to a room on a higher floor with a better view but they didn't have any rooms with a king bed on that floor so we opted to stay on the lower floor.

The live salsa music in the lobby bar is a highlight. Our son sat for an hour one night just listening to it. The hotel is only about a 10 min walk to several other restaurants. There is also a Walgreens in that area. We found a very large, very nice grocery store about a 20 min walk away. There is very very little in the way of other shopping near the hotel which I found surprising given the large number of hotels there.\u00c2\u00a0 The best part of our stay was the exceptional service. The front desk staff was very welcoming and helpful. There was a mixup with our reservation when we arrived and they immediately resolved it.

Overall the hotel is similar to other, newer Courtyards in the U.S. Check-in was very easy and the rates and everything else was as it should be. The main floor is very open with a casino on the right, a bar and restaurant in the center portion, and an ice cream parlor and small snack bar as well. If you are traveling with kids, the casino is tastefully done so that is not offensive for families. The beach is very nice, as is the pool. There were plenty of chairs and towels at both. The fitness facility was fine and overlooked the pool. We ate dinner one night at the main restaurant and it was excellent. We were able to sit outside and the warm weather was nice. The rooms are very clean and serviced daily. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty easy to please since I travel so much on business, however I would bring my family here in a minute. Assorted other stuff - The casino is a full-service casino with lots of slots, craps tables, card games, and other gambling games. I won $20 bucks playing blackjack and called it a night. They have entertainment some nights in the area next to the main bar. They were teaching people how to salsa. Those who participated appeared to have fun. If you need to get a cab from the hotel, there are plenty and wait times are in seconds, not minutes. Safety was never an issue as the grounds were well maintained and patrolled.

The pool area is also nice and clean. The rooms are spacious and beds are very comfortable. The casino was great (probably my favorite part - although I'm not a huge gambler). Food at Salsa/Banana's/Papaya was decent. Now the bad/annoying: Service - Perhaps everyone is just on island time, but I felt the speed of service at the hotel (and literally everywhere we went on the island) was atrocious. The \"best\" were probably the waiter's at Salsa (all they had to do was bring us drinks though), and the cashier's at the casino were fairly quick. The worst were the people at Banana's Cafe - absolutely the worst service I've gotten anywhere. Took them 20 minutes to make some icecream for us (ran out of BANANAS of all things), and the day we left we ordered hotdogs - of which they had zero ready. It took a HALF HOUR to get 2 hotdogs. Word of advice, when you go out to eat, ask for the check way earlier - like well before you're finished eating. Otherwise you'll be lucky to get it before it's time for your next meal (this goes for all local restaurants/bars as well). And forget about getting anything in a remotely timely fashion at Papaya (the outdoor grill/pool bar). First day we got there we ordered a burger and two mixed drinks, and once again waited 25 minutes before we went up and asked where the blank our food was, at which point they started making it. Wonderful. And ordering drinks on the beach if you're already thirsty is a death sentence in that hot sun. It'll take 20 minutes to get back to you. I understand that there are many guests and I'm sure the staff is very busy, but it still takes much longer to get anything than it should. And for someone on vacation who wants to do as many things as possible in a compressed amount of time, this is beyond annoying. Which is a major let down, because so many reviews we read spoke so highly of the staff (not to say that they weren't friendly, but I was by no means impressed with them - I've gotten the same level of service at Motel 6). Other minor annoyances- -The pump/generator that powers the bubbles for the jacuzzi has a high pitched whine. Got used to it after a while, but it was still pretty annoying. -The planes at the airport across the street could sometimes ruin the atmosphere, but this wasn't a huge deal (we live next to train tracks so we're kind of used to stuff like that) -The \"Resort Fees\" - other reviewers had warned of these, but they were quite a bit more than I had planned on. Expect an extra $50-60 per night on top of whatever rate you paid for the room. I know this isn't necessarily the hotel's fault, but it still impacted my opinion. -There seemed to be a different requirement to get towels literally every time we got them. One day we could just get them by asking. The next we gave our room number and needed wristbands (which is lame, since most people are out there to tan!). The next day it was wristbands, room number, and signing a piece of paper. It just got old really fast, especially since I could just take my wristband off and walk up and get another towel w/o question (what was the point?). -Be sure to spray down with bug spray before going to the beach, you'll get annoying, itchy bug bites otherwise. Pick up some of your own at Walgreen's. Probably also wouldn't hurt to have some \"after bite\" cream handy as well. -The sand on the beach is pretty grainy and not all that great. If you're a Florida traveler, the sand is more akin to the Atlantic Side (Daytona, Cocoa, etc) than the Gulf Side (Pensicola, Destin, St. Pete area, etc). Just don't go there expecting it to be some kind of white, shimmering sand (not really the hotel's fault, just an observation). ---ADVICE--- If you go here, get your booze at Mad Dog down the road by Walgreens - Unless you enjoy paying $10 for a mixed drink and $5 for a beer (+tip). Maybe I'm a cheepskate (or an alcoholic), but getting a fifth and some mixers for the week kept the cost WAY down. Staff there was very helpful - we got the BEST service at the liquor store than anywhere else on the island. If you decide to visit Old San Juan, and want to do it on the cheap via the bus system, be prepared to wait at the bus stop indefinitely. Bus drivers are also on island time, and just sort of come and go whenever they feel like it. We were going to go one day, waited for an hour in the hot sun, then said screw it. Tried again the next day and waited 45mins and the bus finally came. Go ahead, ask the front desk what the bus schedule is. They'll say \"there isn't really a schedule.\" On the plus side, the 2 of us got to Old San Juan for $3 round trip. On the down side, the bus drivers are clinically insane and you have to deal with the constant nagging fear of getting stabbed. ---SUMMARY--- I wasn't super impressed with the hotel in general.I felt it was lacking in some form on almost every level (some much more extreme than others). I also just wasn't very impressed with the island itself. If I had to plan this vacation all over again, I would have chosen a different location entirely. Puerto Rico is cool in that it's still America (sort of), and it can be relatively inexpensive. But this hotel and the island were certainly not what I was expecting, and I highly doubt I would return.

It seemed that 99% of them had some form of ocean view. The beach had some great hammocks and comfortable beach chairs. A/c worked very well. Cons: This hotel is literally behind the airport runway. You could hear the planes taxi, wait for the runway to be clear and take off as if you were sitting on the runway. Not all that conducive to relaxing. It wasn't all the time - seemed like the planes would take off in groups about once an hour or so. This might not bother some people, but it just wasn't what I was expecting for my relaxing vacation. Also - the bed in my room was concave. Nice plush bed, but with a giant sink hole in the middle. Not what I'd expect for a Courtyard. Finally, when I got there I was told my room wasn't ready (which was fine, I got there pretty early). The nice lady at the front desk said that an upgraded room was available for a bit more per night. I took it - sounded like a good deal. After seeing the room, I am 90% sure I was \"upgraded\" to the same room we would have otherwise had - on the lowest floor in the hotel with a great view of the A/C units (granted, beyond the A/C units was the ocean) and as far away from the ocean as you could get. Since I had reserved a beach view, not sure how this was an upgrade. The room was fine, but I just don't think it was an upgrade from the room I reserved.

But choose your room carefully. First of all, we had booked an \"ocean view\" room. However, when we checked in and went to our room and looked out the balcony, we were facing a not-so-great-looking condo building with a view of the trash compactor at the back of the hotel. Sure, you could see a sliver of the ocean between two buildings, but it's not what I had in mind. I went down to the front desk and they upgraded us to a \"deluxe ocean view\", but that cost us an extra $30 a night. The view from that room was outstanding. The room itself was great. Roomy. Clean. Fridge was a life-saver. Cleaning crew noticed we drank all the bottled water they left and left us a full case the next day. Always had plenty of clean towels. Pool was good sized, clean and there were a lot of other kids around for my 8 year old to hang out with. He was in there at least 6 hours a day. Nice swim up bar. We all loved the fitness center. We work out a lot at home and were pleasantly surprised at how well appointed the gym was. Nice treadmills, ellipticals and bikes, dumbells up to 50 lbs. Adequate selection of machines, Swiss balls. medicine balls, etc. Best of all, it was always empty. We never saw anyone else use it. The stretch of beach is the largest and cleanest I've seen in Puerto Rico. Not crowded. Beautiful view, took a lot of long walks and swam a lot. Great. Restaurants/Bars: The facilities inside the hotel were very nice. Can't comment on the casino, never used it. Nice bar with live music on some nights. They have a nice soda-shop-type place in front that serves pizza, hot dogs, sandwiches and ice cream. The food at the two \"adult\" restaurants was top notch. Wait staff was very friendly and accomodating. Our son is not an adventurous eater and when we sat down at the nicer restaurant the waitress was great about getting a pizza for him at the other restaurant and bringing it over. The only other caveat I have is, the prices were a little steeper at the hotel than I expected. We were on a tight budget and maybe I'm spoiled from years of dirt cheap excursions to Jamaica but...Drinks at swim-up bar--$8, $3 for a soft drink. Breakfast Buffet--$15.95 each. Dinners started at $20-25. Like I said, food and drinks were good, and if you're not on a budget, fantastic. If you are on a budget, I suggest taking a walk up the street a bit. There are some nice restaurants within walking distance that have good food at a fraction of the price. There's also a big grocery store close by. We picked up some beer, booze and some snacks, stocked our in-room fridge and a cooler and saved ourselves a ton. I wouldn't worry about the comments you read about the jet noise. It was a non-factor for us. We live on the NW side of Chicago and we have ten times the amount of jet traffic and noise from O'Hare than we heard here.

Our room was not ready when we checked in so we went to one of the restaurants and had a cocktail with one of the free tickets they gave us. We waited about an hour and a half for our room. Yes, the planes are noisy out by the pool. The pool is on the runway. Once inside your hotel room, you cant hear the planes. The views from the rooms suck. The room was ok, nothing to get excited over. The bathroom itself is in need for a facelift. The flooring is dated and so is the countertop.We did like the comfort of the beds, the in-room coffee maker and the little refrigerator. You can grab a ride on the city bus and take it into Old san Juan for 75 cents. There are tiny \"sand fleas\" around the pool area that sting like crazy , but once you pick off the tiny brown bugs, they stop stinging and usually do not leave a red welt or mark. There are also tons of biting bugs on the beach. Don't even bother trying to lay on a towel out on the sand, you will be eaten alive! Then, there are all of the huge lizards and two giant iguanas around the pool area. One of the iguanas actually got in the pool and scared my mother in law half to death. They crawl under your chair while you are trying to relax, they lay out in the middle of the pool deck when you are trying to walk- they are everywhere! I guess my BIG problem with this hotel started when I returned home with over 90 insect bites on my body, I went to the doctor and found out it was SCABIES from the hotel bed. How do I know it was from the hotel? All four of us were healthy before we left on our tri and since our hotel room had two queens, my husband and little girl slept in one queen and my son and myself slept in the other queen. BOTH my son and myself came down with SCABIES and my husband and daughter DID NOT. I decided to call the hotel and inform them of the problem they were having on the 5th floor, so they could fumigate and so that no other happy vacationer would have to go through what I was going through. I had to have cream spread over my entire body ( all cracks and crevices) from the neck down to the soles of my feet and then lay in it for 14 hours to kill the microscopic insects and kill the eggs they were laying in my body. The hotel manager could have cared less. She basically told me it was my problem and she would check into it. I got an email 3 days later, she said their exterminator didnt see anything in the room...Helloooooooooooo??? Do you understand they are microscopic?? You are not going to see anything with your eyes! Bottom line is: Marriott doesnt care about the health or safety of their customers.

Frances who reduced our already low nightly rate and placed us in a room on the 6th floor with a great view. We did not take the upgrade for full ocean front viewing, but ours was sufficient with a more than respectable partial view with balcony. I understand that by going to the Ritz down the street you often don't even get a balcony and pay soooo much more $$$$. The actual property was well maintained and service was very good, but I'll have to say~ that in PR service is not one of this territories strong suite. We waited entirely too long once off the property wherever we went to be waited on. We didn't care for much of the local food and we had our share. Most local fare seems to be fried. We would return again to the same hotel and shorten our stay. It would be a great place to go to with another couple or group. During our stay, they didn't have many children at the facility, which was great for us. Appeared to be more business travellers or couples. When we walked up the the Ritz it was packed with lots of people and especially children. We also walked down to the Innercontinental hotel, which we liked, again a lot of people.

Something about the meats in Puerto Rico, meat here is just excellent. Once here, you won't want to eat anywhere else. There are casinos for that crowd and every night, an upscale band area that draws the local dancing crowd. I think that is my favorite, you can be a spectator or a participant, I danced for an hour tonight, random men approach you and ask you to dance. Not to pick you up, but to dance. Men in Puerto Rico are charming and they can dance! The children seem thrilled because of the pools, the ice cream bar and large areas to just run on the expansive beach. Also good for couples because of the romantic outside restaurant overlooking the ocean. Then, well then there is the state of the art exercise room. Wow, I have to say, this place is amazing. The planes are nearby and loud until about ten at night otherwise, my room was quiet and restful... but then again, the planes are nearby and getting to and from the airport is a snap. I have not used the travel assistance downstairs yet, but you can book anything you might want to do right from the lobby last minute. My only complaint was that I had to drive into Old San Juan and then west the first three days I was here and the traffic is murder at morning and evening drive times.

I have visited San Juan for vacation before and always love the old city and the surrounding towns. Carolina is in the Isla Verde section, a 15 minute drive from Old San Juan (about a $20 one-way cab ride). It is a 5 minute walk from the Ritz Carlton and a 15 minute walk to the El San Juan Hotel & Casino. The Ritz has the largest casino in the general San Juan area and the El San Juan Hotel has great bars, clubs and music dotted throughout the enormous and hip lobby. But... back to the Courtyard. I've always seen the Courtyard as a business-centric hotel. This one... not so much. First, it was very affordable. Second, a good size bar in the center with spanish music being DJ'd through speakers. Quite loud and a little ... garish. But. There were a lot of people out on the floor enjoying it. There's a small casino and an ice cream / sandwich counter. The room was pretty huge and the bed was wondefully soft and fluffy and a fantastic night's sleep. The beach!!! The back portico area had tables set up and the beach (I think it was open to public access) was pretty large. Very clean, the water was wonderfully warm. In my experience, PR waters, at least on the north side of the island are not bathwater calm like some parts of the Carib, but that particular day, there were nice, rolling waves - not too rough, but active enough to keep it interesting. Beach chairs are provided. The Luis Munos Int'l Airport runway is right behind the hotel. So you'll hear the plane engines fire up from somewhere in the treeline and then see planes pop up a little ways down. Leaving the airport, I saw the Courtyard pass by. Not too bad. Just pop your earbuds in. If I need a cheap, quick getaway from the mid-atlantic chill, I will definitely consider staying here again. The beach was lovely as was the room. I am usually on the beach, running around somewhere in Old San Juan or other hotels' clubs and casinos. The $20 cab ride into town is a little steep, but for the very low hotel cost, not a big deal.

This is a great facility but for a change, I booked into the Courtyard Isla Verde on the advice of my customer. I certainly was not disappointed. The beach has to be the best in the San Juan area; shallow so that you can walk a good distance offshore, calm waves but enough that you can body surf a little if desired, wide sandy beach with ample walking opportunities in both directions. For a business traveler, it offers decent restaurants, quick access to SJU airport (the airport noise can be noticeable if a jet is taking off but it last only 20 seconds). Smallish casino but large enough to lose your assets if not careful, like all casinos. Ample supplies of bottled water in the rooms is a definite plus as is the room size. The balconies are functional for two people but nothing more and offer great views. Baths could use some moderization but you can't have everything for around $200/night in the Carribean during high season. I like this facility so much that on an upcoming business trip, my wife and I will stay at the Condado Marriott for 5 days on business but spend 3 days at the Courtyard for relaxation. The dance floor in the bar can be fun and the main job requirement for the waitresses would appear that they be beautiful. I would advise buying beer and taking it to the hotel with you. And, take a collapsible cooler. I really get tired (and ticked off) for paying over $6.00 per beer in hotels. Marriott should know better!

Last year we stayed at the La Concha in Condado but decided to try Isla Verde this time because the beach was supposed to be much nicer and the ocean a lot calmer (it is). We took a taxi from San Juan airport (about $12) and arrived at the Courtyard in no time given the property's location is immediately adjacent to the airport. The check in process went quickly and even though we arrived several hours before check in we were given our room so that we could unpack and begin our vacation. Now on to the ratings of this property: Overall the hotel is in very good shape and all of the people associated with it that we came into contact with were very pleasant and gave us the impression that they wanted us to have a good time. When we pulled up to the hotel the valet/bellman greeted us and said \"welcome home\" and the service and friendliness of the staff continued through our departure a week later. The king room was very nice with an adequate bathroom and a nice balcony that held two chairs and a small table. There was a loveseat (I think it could convert into a bed) and an easy chair in the room along with the standard desk and desk chair. There was also a key lock safe in the closet and a small refrigerator. One nice thing about the hotel is that the room came with two bottles of water and housekeeping left several more each day, again at no additional charge. The balcony gave us a very nice view of the beach and ocean even though it was billed as a \"partial view\" room. If one leaned over the railing and looked the other way you could see the terminal and runways of San Juan airport. The room had a flat screen TV that received a number of channels and there was no additional charge for wired and wireless internet service. The beach was very nice but remember that the entire Isla Verde beach (as I believe are all beaches in Puerto Rico) is public and access cannot be restricted by the hotels. This was never a problem for us and the beach was never really crowded but had a few more people on the weekend. The Courtyard has an attendant on the beach to help set up lounge chairs for hotel guests and also has several hammocks that are located between the hotel and the beach. There is an adequate size L-shaped pool adjacent to the hotel and beach with a separated children's area and a hot tub. There is also a swim up bar in the main pool and servers will take your order at adjacent tables or at your pool/beach chair for food and drinks. We spent most of our time at the pool going to the ocean a few times each day. The hotel staff mans a stand to give guests beach towels just as you leave the hotel lobby and enter the pool area. Immediately adjacent to the pool is a small but fairly well equipped exercise room that is open 24 hours a day with access via your room key card. The hotel has a very small casino that seems to offer most games and slot machines but since we aren't gamblers I won't try to give it a rating. As to food service at the hotel there is an ice cream/sandwich counter in the lobby that is open fairly late at night (good ice cream), a bar (Picante) that really is busy on the weekends with live music and a limited food selection. The food items we sampled at the bar were very good although as I stated it was limited selection. There is a restaurant called Salsa which serves a buffet breakfast every morning for about $15 but it is very good with a lot of selections including fruit and pastries and then the restaurant has menu service during the rest of the day with mainly Puerto Rican cuisine and then I believe 3 nights a week they have a Puerto Rican cuisine buffet which we sampled. The other restaurant Sirena, is more upscale and diners eat outside under a canopy. We did not eat at this restaurant so I can't comment on the food or servce. Overall we found the food to be very good (I loved the hamburger at the bar/pool and in the bar area) and face it folks, it's a resort so you are going to pay $10-$12 for a hamburger and fries. If you want McDonalds get out and walk there! To sum things up I found the following to be negatives about the Courtyard: 1. The hotel is at the end of the resort strip along Isla Verde so if you want to go to local restaurants/drug store/grocery stores you have a good 15-30 minute walk depending on what you are looking for. When we stayed in Condado there were a number of restaurants and other stores within a block or two. 2. If you are sensitive to noise, staying at this hotel will probably bother you due to the traffic at San Juan airport. We basically got used to it and it really didn't make us wish we stayed elsewhere. This is one of the prices you will pay for staying on Isla Verde versus Condado but the plus is you will be at your hotel from the airport in 15 minutes or less. The pluses: 1. The staff was very nice including housekeeping who had our room always made up early in the day. You can tell that management has done a good job training the staff and I always noticed some management type walking around both inside and outside the hotel every day just looking at things. 2. The setting is beautiful on Isla Verde beach whish has relatively calm water thanks to an off shore reef. 3. Nice room with a balcony that we could actually use. We had a \"french balcony\" at La Concha that was worthless as we couldn't sit outside and enjoy the tropical air. 4. A nice pool but regular style rather than the infinity type. It was perfect for us and everyone we saw there seemed to enjoy it. 5. Overall it was a very enjoyable stay and I feel we got our money's worth. My wife and I love Puerto Rico and while we want to try out the Caribbean side of the island next time I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Courtyard.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon-Pre-cruise stay (OK!) but not for the money\u201d", "Author": "vpagew", "ReviewID": "UR53982706", "Content": "We had planned to stay in San Juan for 3 days before our cruise and search many options for hotels.

This was not worth $129/night at all but not more than $99/night. The hotel states that the regular price is $200+/night. ha!! Pros 1. The hotel room is HUGE. A regular size hotel room could fit a couple with small kids, as they provided us with a sofa that let out to a bed. 2. All rooms had a balcony. Awesome!

They give you a free rum drink coupon for 2, a $25 voucher (can't use it on the slot machines) for the casino and some coconut candy. Con's 1. The bathroom was pretty nasty. It looked like no one had stayed in that room for 6month to 1yr. I kept my shoes on as long as possible in there. The shower...... my husband fell in it (be careful).

We tried a buffet at the restaurant, Fiesta which was $24 pp. SAVE your money. RUN FAST! It was awful. The other restaurant/bar area that gives salsa dance lessons was better- $12 pp for salad, chicken and fries. 3. The hotel is located at the very END of the strip. You have to walk about 10minutes (not too bad) to get to any food or busy area. Isla Verde is a good area to stay but it's just the furthest hotel. 4. LOUD!

As hotels go, it was a basic three-star Courtyard but also had a casino and very lively restaurant/bar scene. The staff was friendly and helpful. We upgraded our room to feature an oceanfront view which provided quiet and privacy. Many of the partial view rooms would be more exposed to the adjacent parking lots, busy street and airport runway so the oceanfront is a great bet to feel like you are truly having a \"resort\" experience. There were live bands each night which performed some wonderful latin music and lots of the local crowd comes to dance and enjoy the casino. It is possible to walk down the beach or street to visit local restaurants. One direction takes you to hotel row and the other to a village of local fried food joints. This location worked well as a base to explore other sights both in San Juan and farther afield.

My criteria was warm air, warm ocean, not too crowded, not too expensive, and no rental car needed. I picked the Courtyard and hit the bull's eye. All the good things: Easy to get to: just 5 minutes from the airport Quiet: Even with the airport right there the room was exceptionally quiet. Double sliding doors were the key. Great Sleep: Loved the bed, I haven't slept this well in months (and boy did I need it), easily slept 12 hours a night. Nicely dark room: as I've gotten older (50's) I've become more sensitive to light and the room was delightfully dark. The hotel is the last one on the strip and adjacent to the public beach. So every day (around noon!) we would get some beach towels at the pool and head east away from the hotel. Always found a nice patch by ourselves away from other conversations, cigarettes, etc. Ocean was great for swimming all afternoon (my favorite part). Never did use the pool but it looked nice. Tips: Nearest Starbucks is in the El San Juan (about a 10 minute walk). There's a Walgreens next to the Ritz but it closes at 10PM, Another Walgreens is 24 hours and it is about another 15 minutes from the first one (left side of street) Pueblo is a grocery store behind the Chili's.

I met some people on the beach at the hotel and also went to Drums, a bar a few blocks away by the Denny's, which was great for dancing too. The hotel itself is very nice, quiet, good service, good room, and on what I would say is the best beach in the San Juan area. The water was clean, warm, nice beach and waves not too big. There are little sandflies and over 3 days I got about 10 bites, but they are not itchy and you can put on bugspray. The hotel's pools and gym are great (I would suggest some yoga mats), and my room had a peek a boo view of the water. The food in the Salsa restaurant was good with very soft, fresh bread at dinner and a good breakfast buffet. Downside is being a $17 taxi ride from Old San Juan but I combined this hotel with 2 nights at El Convento there for the best of both worlds (ie beach and culture). I did not get a chance to take the bus but I did not feel at all unsafe walking around anywhere. If coming in for a cruise, one must spend some time in Puerto Rico.

I obtained a great deal on Hotwire for this hotel, and since it was the last night of our trip to Puerto Rico, we wanted a place nearby the airport for our hotel yet still on the beach and this was a perfect fit. For the low price we paid, I was astounded by the service and quality of the hotel. Staff was friendly and check in was a breeze. The hotel is also located in Isla Verde, a little resort town (we had already spent several days staying in Old San Juan and around the island - this isn't OSJ, so you have to expect less culture and more of a resort feel). But it is close (5-10 minute walk) to some restaurants, shops, and bars/clubs. It was also like a 15 minute walk from where we had to drop off our car rental so it worked out perfectly. The lobby is big and nice. It was a special trip for my partner which I had mentioned and I and we received an upgrade to a gorgeous ocean view room and fruit plate. I wasn't sure what to expect of the room but it had an amazing comfortable king size bed, a huge flat screen tv, a nice if not luxurious bathroom, and view from the balcony was breathtaking. We also got a coupon for a free drink and a casino credit at check in and went downstairs later to use those. The casino is small but serves the purpose of playing a little Blackjack or some slots. We then wandered over to sit outside on the ocean front patio area until it started raining, which is too bad because it was gorgeous out. Since we were only there one night we didn't get to enjoy the pool, beach hammocks or beach itself, but ithey looked really nice. Such a shame we only had one night! We enjoyed the live salsa music in the restaurant. Unfortunately the restaurant was not serving food, so we went upstairs to call room service and they said the kitchen was closed but they could see what they could do. The ended up finding a couple of items we wanted to eat and bringing them up, very quickly too! Great and wonderful service all over. I would stay here again, especially for the price. It's not top shelf luxury like the Ritz, but again, for the price, it is a good solid quality 3 1/2 star hotel and I have absolutely no complaints, everything was wonderful and great.

We danced to two awesome Salsa bands who play Wednesday night through Saturday night. Great drinks, great atmosphere, and great wait staff. The Casino is smoke-free as the rest of the establishment. There a good selection of slots and a couple of table games as well. We had a couple days of rain so having so much to do at the hotel helped entertain our family when the beach wasn't an option. One last thing: I had misplaced my wedding band...wasn't sure if I left it in the room or somewhere else.

The closets are on the small side but there are plenty of drawers. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor and furnishings seem new; wonderful big flat screen TV; and the bed is very comfortable! The room seems well-insulated for sound and so, we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear any noises from the hall or adjacent rooms. The jets flying in and out of the airport, on the other hand, could be easily heard and sound like thunder sometimes. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d only hear them intermittently from about 7am to 11 pm. There didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any jets flying in the middle of the night. If there were, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear them at all!

It was pricey but we had a view of the beach and listened to the live band while we dined. Overall, dining there is not remarkable but not disappointing either; certainly convenient but, again, pricey. The service in all aspects of the hotel is friendly, efficient, and prompt. But of note, we highly commend and are very grateful to the concierge (her name is Yadira) who helped us rent a car. Our request was a last-minute need and she worked way past her shift in the evening calling around rental car companies to secure a car for us. When she did find one, she drove us to the rental car company in her own car, on her own time and without expecting anything in return! She was just so kind and wonderful! Again, a heartfelt thank you and kudos to her! Bottom line, I would recommend this hotel mainly for the beach, convenience to the airport, and easy highway access especially if you use this as your base to do day trips outside of SJ. However, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a charming hotel and want to experience SJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique culture, opt for a hotel in Old San Juan.

The long Isla Verde beach is very pretty with nice smooth sand, although there was a mild seaweed zone you had to get through to get out into body-surfing depth water. It was never too crowded at the beach or pool. The hotel had three places to eat: a small ice-cream shop which also sold sandwiches, the main lobby bar, and the main restaurant. The bar area is big and it isn't a problem to have kids there to eat at a table, and you can get moderately priced meals there. The food at the bar was not bad and it and the ice cream shop were fairly priced, I'd have to say. The main dining area usually had big buffets and was considerably more expensive.

The hotel is right on the beach, has a nice beach front pool area, and all rooms have ocean views and balconies. The room was clean and the decor was new, including a flat screen television. There was a small refrigerator, and it was not stocked, so you could actually use it, which was great. It has a really nice vibe in the lobby, with live music on the weekends and a small casino. The hotel is not perfect. The gym/fitness room is inadaquate. One day our room was not made up. The breakfast buffet was only fair. However, the price (we booked through marriott.com) was fantasic!

I stay at a lot of Marriotts. . Take away the fact that this is right on the beach and it is basically a super 8 hotel or a holiday inn. (I was told that this is actually an old renovated holiday inn). Room and bathroom were clean. Air conditioning was one of those cheap inside the room motel units where you control the temp by turning knobs on the AC unit. It was noisy but noisy is good because you are VERY near the airport. Room smelled bad when I entered to drop my bags but it was better when I came back that night as I turned the AC up before I left. I was on the east side of the hotel (Even numbered rooms) and had an ocean view. The only problem was that if you look down, you see a really dirty and LOUD roof with lots of AC units on top of it. Stay on as high a floor as possible so you don't have to listen to the industrial sounds out your window. Breakfast is average. . . just average .. workers were doing some repairs on the floor so all you could hear was a floor sander all morning. Location is near the airport but the Ritz Carlton is equally near the airport. It is right on the beach but just a little bit seedy to be walking down the street at night. Beach is clean, nice and safe. Basically, if you are used to the \"clean and crisp feel\" of a Marriott, this does not feel like a Marriott. If you are going on vacation with your kids and you want to be right on the beach and not worry about your kids running through a higher-end resort, this place is probably fine. I would not stay here again, even if I came with my family but for the money, it is an average place, next to the airport that is saved by being right on the beach.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Playa del carmen", "Title": "\u201cwas a nice room but to expensive evrything\u201d", "Author": "manzanita_light", "ReviewID": "UR23148510", "Content": "we went on vacation for our aniversary for a week.

Normally these larger chains have wireless available for a fee - and a large fee at that. This one was free. Other Marriotts could learn from this and put their greed aside. Check in was supposed to be at 15:00 and was disappointing - in fact the worst part of the stay. After a long trip from Belgium, the last thing we wanted was an unpleasant surprise to deal with. We arrived around 13:30, announced ourselves, left our bags and went for lunch at the Metropol. So they knew we were waiting. No complaints yet as we were early. Returned at 15:00 to be told that the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready and that check in BEGINS at 15:00. Not at 15:00, but BEGINNING at 15:00. What does that mean? Check in could be as late as midnight??? I became difficult at that point and gave the desk many questions that they either stumbled through or couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u02dct answer without a canned reply from the Marriott book. In the end the room was ready at 16:00. It would have been later had I not been such a nuisance. The desk was professional, mature and polite, but geared to justifying the situation. (Did you know that it takes 45 minutes to clean a room and that there are four cleaners for every twelve rooms, some people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check out on time and that a lot of other people are also waiting?) Interesting but not as interesting as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Check-in BEGINS at 15:00!!!. We were told to GO AWAY\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and have lunch, or have dinner, or have a drink, or walk around. Also, the desk staff kept disappearing into the rear for us and other people trying to check in which really slowed things. When I told them that we had hoped to have a few hours at the beach for the children, we were told that most families bring a change of beach clothes with them in case this situation happens. That was really helpful. Nothing was offered to make us feel better (free drinks, food coupons, room discount, etc). We were informed that the room was an upgrade from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ocean Front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on the front, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they were talking about. Maybe there are rooms with Ocean Front in capital letters and ocean front in lower case. But they lost big, big points here. After all, this is a Marriott and Marriott has a lot of beatings of drums over being a great host. (The late check-in appeared to be a daily occurrence.) Room was good size and nice, but average. Bathroom was clean but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Large screen TV with good channels. Small fridge. Small safe in room. Beds were very, very comfortable. Could have used a bit more storage furniture. Pool had a lagoon motif. Not very big, but always space available. (The beach was so nice that most people went there.) Lots of sun beds pool-side or by the beach. Hot tub was hot, really too hot - but then again, it is called a hot tub. Pool staff very polite and efficient. There was a wedding one afternoon and it was interesting to see how they slowly closed down parts of the patio to accommodate the wedding with minimal impact on the other guests. We had stayed at the Intercontinental (IC, for the purposes of this review) the last time we were in Isle Verde - and the IC was superior to the Courtyard in every category. But then, the IC costs more. Our expectations of the Courtyard were high based on the IC, so some aspects were disappointing from the start. The best part of the hotel was the access to the beach - one of the reasons we stayed here. Clean sand, nice waves, leave the pool and walk right onto the beach itself. Kids loved it. Safe and fun. House-keeping was a bit slow, but they lost big points as we found a used condom on the bathroom floor when we first entered the room during our late check-in. Yuck!!!! Housekeeping resources was also just as strained during the visit as it was during the check-in. The first full day the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned until 17:00. I spoke with my friends at the check-in desk and they fixed this. Afterwards, the room was cleaned in the morning. I guess that you have to tell the hotel what you want instead of letting them guess what you want. The hotel had several restaurants, but better value for money could be found outside. There was a breakfast buffet for $15.95, but as a family of four, it would cost about $70 once the tax was applied. There was an ice cream counter that also had some baked items, but despite having three people behind the counter, you had to beat them with a stick to get their attention. In fairness to the hotel regarding food prices, all the other hotels on the beach also price gouge. They will charge as much as they think they can get you to pay. There were people in the restaurants, but many of them were short term visitors who went in without knowing what the damage would be. The prices at the IC were much worse. As a breakfast alternative, there was a Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ten minutes away across from the Metropol (see below). Normal Dennny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food, but service was very, very slow. Accept it and you will be happy. Expect something snappy and you will get into a irritated funk. With the portions they served, our brood of four only cost $20. Also a Walgreens pharmacy in the same shopping area. Speaking of prices, we took it on the chin for the room charge. During Christmas they (and all the other hotels) double the rate. So instead of around $180 a day, the room was $350. It was still cheaper than the other hotels we considered. They also attached a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 of $45 (13% of the base price) a night. I was told that covered free water in the rooms, towel service at the pools and entertainment at night. Seems like a lot for daily water, one towel per person and loud music. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a government required fee (like tourist tax), but just a Marriott policy. Why charge a separate fee for no visible and severable cost unless you are trying to hide a surcharge to make your rate look more attractive? Also a fee of $25 for each person in the room over two people per night. So in our case, another $50 per night. Not a severable cost that they were trying to recover. It was just an additional price that Marriott charges. As they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t associate a cost for the two extra people other than extra towels, I suppose the hotel grabs what it can take. We knew about the fees when we made the reservation by looking closely at the Marriott website, but many of my fellow travelers were surprised to see it on their bills. Why hide these costs in the small print of the reservation? Put it up front in the rate. Greed. And greed will find you by yourself and lonely one day Marriott at Isle Verde. The hotel over charged us on the final bill in that one of our brood was 12 and exempt to the $25 extra person fee and they applied the 13% resort fee to the extra person fee also. We chatted about it for some time and they finally eliminated the resort fee, but kept the extra person fees. As we are now on food, the location of hotel was a little inconvenient as it is on the end of the developed beach. All the non-hotel restaurants were a short walk away along a busy road (busy with cars, but sometimes a little uneasily devoid of people - especially at night - until you reach the Metropol). Lots of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd style or fast food places 15 minutes away on the main rood (across from the IC). As well as the Mi Casita in a small strip mall across from the IC - good local fare at very reasonable prices. Basic atmosphere, but always packed. The bill at Mi Casita doubled charged the drinks one night, so buyer beware. Also a Chinese place a few doors down from Mi Casita. Normally not very full, but tasty. Not great, but tasty. Best non-hotel restaurant remains the Metropol - local food, fairly priced, big portions, nice atmosphere. Between the hotel and the IC and next to the cock-fighting arena (wonder if the losing birds are served at the restaurant next door?). We went there almost everyday. The kids loved the grilled red snapper. I liked the pepper steak Cuban style and stuffed guinea fowl. Service could have been better, but it depended if you have the A team or the B team for waiters. Also, the wife reported that there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any running water in the ladies room for three days (including flush). So \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freshen up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before you go just in case and avoid a seat (at a table) near the toilets. She reported it each time, but what the heck - all the waiters were guys so I suppose it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. Men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room was fine. Sounds like a one-off since this hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t occurred on previous vacations there. The worst Mexican food in North America can still be found at Lupi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the main drag between the hotel and the IC. Great place for getting beered up and watching sports programmes, but the food is the worst Mexican fare I have ever had. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen some good reviews of it on the internet, but I wonder how much these reviewers had to drink before they ate something there. Last year two of the dishes weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t edible - when we brought it to their attention, the waitress and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd assured us that the food was fine, and we had just ordered something that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like (grilled snapper or grouper and a traditional Mexican combo plate). Such a disappointment. It looked like the menu had changed somewhat since last time, but after our first experience, why throw money away. Anything that bad doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve a second chance. Having said that, we did dip our toes in the water and tried the Lupi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nachos during a beering session. I thought they were so-so, but the wife thought they were the worst she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had. Guacamole was described as slimey and the beef suspicious. She couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat it. That was yesterday and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel sick, so I suppose it was ok to eat it. The pool guys at the hotel also thought that the food was bad - with the exception of the buffalo wings. Looks fantastic from the outside as a Mexican sports bar - your mouth will water, but such a disappointment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to mess up Mexican food (even Taco Bell Express and Old El Paso at the supermarket get by), but they found the secret (its even worse than mine). One thing we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like (not related to the hotel), was the absence of small grocery stores. 7-11\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs, etc. to stock the fridge in the room There was one across from the IC of good size, but the shelves were only one third full. Strange place. There was also a Pueblo market on the other side of the Holiday Inn, but not very easy to get to. Would I go back again? If my first choices were too expensive or full, I think that I would. But I would watch the bill like a hawk and let them know ahead of time that check-in was at 15:00 and rooms were to be cleaned in the morning. After all, the beach was great and the people tried hard to make it a nice stay (once you checked in).", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winona, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201ccould not have been any better!!\u201d", "Author": "KathyGlow", "ReviewID": "UR23121166", "Content": "We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott pre-cruise in January.

We were again surprised that we were offered some coupons for the bar for a free drink. That was so nice. We didn't have oceanfront rooms but were again shocked to find out we did have ocean views!

We were on a higher floor room which was nice. We only stayed one night but wished we could have stayed longer. You could easily stay right here for a week or longer! The outdoor restaurant was very nice. We didn't eat there but menu looked good. We ate at the buffet and that was good. Salsa night club was fun with people dancing and good drinks. We went into Casino for a few mintutes & my husband did win! Fun! Cute little gift shop and little cafe also on the main floor. The next day we ate at the cafe and brought our food outside by the pool. The bar opened up at 10:30 and we had our first Pina Colada. So good. Very nice pool area. The beach was wonderful and we had fun in the large waves that were splashing up that monring. I would stay here again without hesitation. Wonderful stay.

We bought supplies for the next few days snacks, bread, sandwich meats, beer, rum etc. Room: We had an ocean view room on the opposite side from the airport. The view was so-so but we don't spend much time in the room so we didn't mind. We went to the beach instead where the view was just fine. Hotel/Lobby/Grounds: The pool was very nice but we spent our time on the beach. We rented chairs ($6 per day)..drink prices we high so we made our own in our mugs and brought them to the beach.

We checked in early around 1:30pm on Monday and were promptly handed two free drink coupons and match play coupons for the casino. We got to the room and we saw we had been upgraded to a full ocean view! A fruit platter along with a note from Mrs. Ng wishing us an outstanding stay really impressed us and right there, we knew we were going to have a great time. We spent most of our time at the beach or by the pool. Beach is excellent, it was very quiet (maybe because it was mid-week?) and it was very relaxing which is what we wanted. We sucked it up and paid the $6 for a beach chair (over the week though it adds up) but I still dont understand why that cant be included in the resort fee. Pool area was very nice and clean and we spent a lot of time at the swim-up bar. Jacuzzi is right next to the pool and it was usually empty. Hammocks are further back- all in all a very relaxing enviornment. We ate dinner at Salsa which was very good. Another night we went to Picante for drinks/small dinner and that was good as well. Wished we tried Sirena but ran out of time. For breakfast/lunch Banana's was a great option because its quick and more afforable then the breakfast buffet. One night we also ventured to Metropol and that was outstanding Cuban food. Worth the 10-15 minute walk. For nightime activites, we usually hung out in Picante or hit the casino in the hotel. Casino is small but gets the job done. Some dealers were friendly and talkative - especially Omar. I wish they rest were like him. One night we went down to the Ritz to check their casino out, which is a little better but really isnt much different. Next time I come I would advise to stay at least one weekend night as the resort seemed dead at times (though not always a bad thing). I could see on Thursday night the place was more crowded with the Salsa dancing and live music, so I'm assuming the weekend would be like that.

We almost felt like they're on commission on how much they can charge a customer! Priceline pulled my recorded phone call as a proof that the agent didn't disclose any additional fees and guaranteed us no other fees upon arrival. but still nobody wanted to take the charge! They have a different manager every day and when asked to talk to the GM, my request was declined. I felt like on the open air market, the mgr started negotiating how much they would cover. Absolutely unproffesional. Their answer was that they have experienced similar issues with priceline before but they couldn't do anything. So who pays for their lousy contract..yes, sadly enough the custumer . I always stay at the Marriott for business purposes and this was my first stay as a personal vacation.

Our room was large and clean and the queen size beds were SO comfortable! Everything in the room worked fine for us, and having the DVD player was great for late at night. The pool and beach area were very clean and even though the hotel was nearly full (3 weddings!), we never felt crowded anywhere on the property. We ate dinner at the Sirena restaurant 2 nights in a row. Great food and very nice staff. Plus, you sit outside so you can watch the sunset while you eat! We got lunch from the pool side grill. You put your order in and they bring it to you--even if you are out on the beach! The beach chairs do cost 6.00 per day but are worth it. We ordered room service breakfast 2 days which was very good and ate at Banana's cafe the third morning which was also good. The Picante lounge was a fun and jumping place. We didn't go into the casino, but it is large and looked fun. They also have a game room right off of the casino with quite a few video games. Check out was simple. We did it on the TV screen. I've stayed in other hotels in San Juan and Carolina and of all of them, this was most definitely the best for what we wanted. It's close enough to Old San Juan and other attractions around the area and is right on the beautiful Isla Verde beach. The airport is literally a stone's throw away, but we didnt hear a single plane in our room. The balcony's have double doors but we only had one closed at any given time. You do hear the planes on the beach, but being from the NY/NJ area with 3 major airports nearby, planes dont bother us. In fact, it was fun to watch them! When I reserved this room, I had some communications with Mr. Arroyo, the assistant manager. He personally confirmed our requests, responded almost immediately to every email and sent a personal welcome when we arrived. Every traveler looks for different things when they book a hotel.

We were greeted my friendly staff at check in. We were there an hour before check in, so we took our 2 free drink voucher and headed for the bar. The bartenders are so friendly! They made the best coconut mojito ever! We got a call on our cell phone saying our room was ready. We headed up and when we opened the door, we were cheesing! We couldn't believe we were in the same room again :) The view is spectacular! We learned from our last trip to get a rental car this time. It's actually much easier than we thought to drive around P.R. We didn't get lost at all! We were able to do all the things we weren't able to do the last trip. We drove to El Yunque (simply gorgeous!!!), We ate at La Casita Blanca (Delish), We went dancing at the water club, Had delicious sandwiches at Espana, Old San Juan, the Outlets, Laquillo beach, drove up and down the coast etc...... We didn't want to leave! I must say.... Courtyard Marriott is no 5 star, chi chi type hotel, however, It is definitely wonderful place to stay. Clean, professional and the FRIENDLIEST STAFF EVER!!!!!!! I have never seen an establishment where the Managers themselves bus tables, restock the food, gets your drinks etc.... They were constantly checking on us. Mr. Hector Sanchez (I think that was his name) and Mr. Gonzales, I believe they are both restaurant managers and they were unbelievable! They were so accommodating and extremely hospitable. They were bussing tables, restocking food and everything else! Raphael, the pool attendant was the greatest! He hooked up our beach chairs with pillows made of towels!!!! So comfy! Raphael was not only our pool/beach attendant, but our concierge, mapquest and photographer!!!! He takes awesome pictures! We asked for 1 photograph and he made us pose in different spots for 4 pictures!!!! They all came out wonderful with beautiful backdrops of the hotel and beach! Thanks Raphael!!! The buffet was DELICIOUS!!!!!! I thought it was good last year, but this year was even better! Much more to choose from and more variety by the day!!!!

I have had massages all over the world and you will NEVER, EVER get one like this!!!!!!!! He was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could have brought him home with me!

My thanks to Alfredo Arroyo and his fabulous staff for their exceptional service. They truly are the best hotel in Puerto Rico! The Marriott Courtyard is on the Isla Verde strip, next to the Ritz, within walking distance to all the stores and shopping you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need, is cost convenient and well worth it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rooms are spacious and service phenomenal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I stayed in one of their ocean front suites the size of a 1-br apartment, fridge, microwave, sink, and coffee pot, DVD/VCR player, etc., you name it. I love that on the day it rained I was able to watch a movie on the super big HDTV. Movies average $10-12, same as the theatres and all most recent releases. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not up for a movie, plug your IPOD in and listen to your favorite tunes on the IPOD docking station/CD player. Housekeeping staff are courteous, polite, and the sweetest ladies I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come across. All are hard-working and remind me of mi abuela (grandma), so please be kind and tip them well. Even the beach chair/towel guys are helpful and will set up an umbrella or cabana over your chair and tie in your towel so it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blow away. Ask them for help, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re great at what they do and will even angle your chair to get the best rays of the sun or to hide from them if you just want the breeze and to read a good book or magazine. Make sure you fill out your Marriott Rewards profile with all your drink/food preferences. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a lovely treat to have water, orange juice, fruit and yogurt already in my room. They really make you feel right at home. Even at the front desk the girls would address me by name or inquire about my stay. Very nice. I purposely steered clear from one of the hotels in Condado because the reviews mentioned that check-in took over an hour, and one review listed several hours. When I stepped out of the elevator one morning I overheard a few guys checking in at the Marriott Courtyard. Their room was not ready, but the staff was going to set them up in lounge chairs on the beach with drinks. It was so funny to see these same guys who could have been fussing, wiggling their toes and basking in the sun \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even checked in and were already having a good time! The Salsa restaurant is great for breakfast. I ate there every morning. I think it came to $14.95 for the breakfast buffet, which is unlimited. Great for me since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a runner and it meant plenty of egg-white omelet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with veggies and turkey, fruit and yogurt, and I could even make my own sandwiches there. Great service and smiles from all the hostesses, the waiters and waitresses, and the omelets/waffle makers are kind, polite and helpful. Almost forgot, one of the reviewers mentioned the costly food, so I was a bit reluctant to order lunch while I was on the beach, but one of the staff told me I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love the chicken strips and she was so right! I had them 3-days in a row. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re crunchy, meaty and the fries remind me of the Boardwalk fries in the Jersey Shore or Ocean City. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to ask for vinegar, I ate them so quickly! The gym is equipped with a Stairmaster, 3 treadmills, free weights and equipment. Great being away from work; I could still watch the market highlights on CNBC and MSNBC, and get in a good morning run. The Jacuzzi is great also and good to know that the pool, Jacuzzi, lounge, casino and business center are all open 24-hours. In the casino the staff is polite and courteous. They serve complimentary drinks and hot sandwiches with turkey and cheese or ham and cheese. The game room is adjacent to the casino and has old and new video games for the kids. The front desk staff were all polite, professional and even helped me with a last minute emergency when I checked out and forgot to print my boarding pass. I realized as soon as I got to the airport that if they hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been so fast in helping me I would have missed my flight. The line was almost out the door for Jet Blue check-ins! The Marriott Courtyard is the only hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come across that makes you feel like extended family. Check out the salsa dancing with live bands at Picante in the lobby bar. The pina coladas are so sweet and delicious. The business center is next to the front desk, includes free internet and printer abilities (Blackberry access is fine, too) I was able to zip in, check emails all free of charge without having to hook up a laptop. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gift shop where you can buy basic toiletries, and the front desk offers complimentary Skintastic spray for those no-see-um gnats. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re into tours they have maps and guides near the front desk, or you can venture out on your own. You can walk to the local shops. Just stay on the right side of the street, pass the Ritz, a few small diners, Lupi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bar, etc. Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and Walgreens are just past the Ritz and before the Intercontinental and El San Juan, It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 15-min walk. The fast food area is across the street from the Intercontinental Hotel, (a small grocery store that sells fresh fruit and anything you can microwave, no fresh meat or fish though, but tons of hot pockets and beer is reasonable. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink, but thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d mention it), UPS, Subway, MiCasita, Wendy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Burger King, etc.) MiCasita serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, where entrees are $9-14 and include red snapper, steak, lasagna, spaghetti and chicken dishes, I definitely did not like their chicharron de pollo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so much better in New York! If you like buffet-style, stop at Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Also, be careful crossing the street. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no light near the Intercontinental, but a crosswalk is there, and the cars go really fast at times. The A-5 bus stops a few blocks to the right of the Intercontinental Hotel, just past the Ritz Carlton where for .75-cents you can ride the bus to the end of the line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a cheap tour of San Juan, Old San Juan and Condado. At the end of the line you can walk two blocks over to catch the ferry to the Bacardi Rum Factory Tour. Just ask anyone for directions to Acqua Express or say the ferry. Basically after you get out of the bus, walk towards the water and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c past Westbank and the Sheraton. The cruise ships are there also. I think the last ferry is at 4-430pm, so keep an eye out and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too tired to see El Morro (the fort/castle, etc) you can check it out and take pics from the ferry. The tour is great, mini-movie included about the Bacardi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, learn to make mojitos, free coupons for drinks, etc. I think the tour is free. I went the last time I was here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the transportation that you have to pay for. All I remember is getting off the ferry the guys argue in Spanish over the price to drive you to the Factory and maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $6-8 a person, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quote me. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not walking distance, so you need the drivers to take you and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re always waiting to bring you back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe not the same driver, but a few are right outside the waiting area where they serve the free rum drinks. If you want to stay close to the hotel and still enjoy the beach, walk to the El San Juan Hotel and go directly behind the hotel. There you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find the water sports area. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this spot existed until the day before I left to head back home. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m anxious to go back and sample all their rides. You can rent jet ski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, go parasailing $65, ride a hobie craft, banana boats are $20, but a minimum of 4-people, and kayaks are $20. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll love being on the water. Kenney runs the San Juan Waterfun. I would call ahead to reserve times, (939) 642-4510. Ask for Dana (pronounced Don-yah). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tell you what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and for parasailing wear sandals or flip flops. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get wet from the waist down. Careful getting into and out of the boats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very slippery. Tip the guys if you can, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the hot sun all day and will take all the pictures you want of you going up in the air. Better to leave your camera with them for pics unless you have a disposable or water proof one that you can tie or fasten to your life vest. Again, my thanks to Alfredo Arroyo and all the staff at the Marriott Courtyard. This trip was such a treat. I hope Mr. Arroyo is going to be promoted soon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he truly deserves it and works so very hard. He responds to emails, inquiries and requests, gives directions and from what I saw is there around the clock - such a great asset and hard worker. The hotel, the grounds, the staff are all exceptional. Sit in one of their hammocks and watch the sunset, or drink coffee from your balcony and watch the sunrise. You decide. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen so many people work so hard to help make my visit enjoyable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already booked my next trip and am looking for additional dates over the holidays! But please, save me a suite, a hammock and a treadmill! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back soon enough!

On the weekends it can become a fight for the umbrella--leave your chairs and someone takes them--I even saw someone run over and pull am umbrella out of the sand when a couple got up to walk. This was irritating. Staff service was also not up to expectations, especially for an elite member. Also note sand fleas are active at dawn and dusk. While signs in the room indicate the hotel will provide insect repellant, we found this difficult to obtain. The front desk looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for it and then told us they did not have any and to try again later.

The tour was pretty short- only three stops and I was expecting to see a lot of animals and I didn't see any. I suggest taking a tour walking through the forest and not on a bus. The third day was another beach day at the hotel. We sat in the sun played in the pool and the ocean. By the way, there were 3 pools. One was a kiddy pool. Another was a pool intended for younger children with a small slide. Both were very dirty and grouse. The last pool was the largest and was pretty well kept. The swim up bar was really neat. The forth day we went on a scuba diving excursion, which was the highlight, in my opinion, of the vacation. We went out on a cool boat to 2 amazing islands to see the fish in the coral reefs. Although I was disappointed that there wasn't as many fish as I expected, I was amazed at how clear and extremely blue the water was.

Before arriving, people told us to stay in Isla Verde. They were right. After an extensive search, the Marriott seemed like the right place for us. Ahead of time we were contacted by Alfredo, Manager at the hotel and he asked what we were interested in doing on our 5 day trip. We gave him some topics and then his staff took over. Check in was friendly and I must have been asked at least five times if everything was okay. Which it was. From the moment we arrived in our awesome rooms, (views that go on for miles), we were well looked after. The rooms were normal size, however, you don't come to Puerto Rico to sit in your room. I had read that the service at the pool was terrible. Nothing could be further from the truth. From the first moment we met Jennifer and Miguel (pool servers), there were drinks and food in a flash. We are not gourmet diners (cheeseburgers, hot dogs, chicken wings, etc) but the beer and margaritas were cold and the food was hot. A couple of comments, about the airplane noise, yes it is there, but the view, the hammocks and the hotel more than make up for it. I thought one review said it best that, \"the airport noise is a non-issue\". At night time, there was Salsa dancing and in the casino Paul (pit boss) and (dealers) Annette, Anita, and Jasmine, were keeping us entertained. The free food while gambling was an unexpected treat. Late at night and early in the morning you are alone on the beach, make sure you take a stroll. Just be careful of the machinery, as this is when the beach is being cleaned. Puerto RIco is not inexpensive, but this hotels' location, service and quality, made it all the better. If you don't relax and have a good time at this hotel, it is your own fault. Bring your flip flops and bathing suit for the day and flip flops and Tommy Bahama shirts for the night, Finally, don't get too frustrated with the waiting when you visit downtown San Juan for dinner, drinks and street life.

Our first night we were in a low, even numbered room (lower numbers are closest to the front of the hotel, the busy main road, and the airport runway). The advantage to even numbered rooms is that they look down the beautiful empty beach to the east. The disadvantage to them, beyond being near the road and runway, is they overlook the roof of the casino with its vent fan noise. You can see the surf but you can't hear it. It sounds like any downtown hotel. To make the rooms quiet the hotel has provided double glass doors to the balconies and they are very effective. But when we have a balcony overlooking a beautiful beach we want to be on it when we're in the room. Not possible here. When a jet lands or takes off all conversation stops and you can feel the sound waves reverberate through your body. Someone in an earlier posting said the airport was a non-issue because of so few jets but we must have been there on a busy week because we heard lots. Our second morning we upgraded to an oceanfront room (for $75. per day extra). The noise problem was solved. It was amazing how quiet the ocean front rooms were with only the sound of the surf. The beach views to the east and west were lovely. As many others have said, we found the hotel staff very helpful. We didn't receive any extra trays of fruit or goodies like others did but perhaps that's because our basic room was a Marriott rewards certificate and we were just paying for the upgrade. The front desk staff were very helpful with any questions we had as were the concierge and the bellman. The concierge set up a trip for us to El Yunque and our guide Robert was extremely informative about the rain forest, the history of the island, current political and cultural issues and events, and anything else our group of about ten could think to ask him. We'd request him again if we visit the hotel in the future. The concierge also recommended a supermarket to us our first afternoon so we could stock the room refrigerator. There is a local chain called Pueblo an easy five to ten minute walk from the hotel. Having some of our own drinks and snacks saved a few dollars since food is quite expensive. While we were there the government announced the price of milk was going up to over $5.00 a gallon!!! Everything isn't that expensive but it does reflect the high costs of food in the supermarkets and in restaurants. The main attraction for many people are the casinos in the hotels. It seems to be a law that only hotels can operate casinos so that brings in lots of business. We never went into the casino so found the beaches pretty empty most of the time. We ate dinner our first night at the hotel's oceanfront restaurant Sirena. There were only two or three tables with guests. The service was quite slow but the waitress and other staff were pleasant and of course the view of the ocean on the patio made any wait enjoyable. The food was surprisingly good. If you like ice cream there is a diner just past the Ritz., I can't remember the name, but I think it's on the corner of the road after the Ritz. It's before you get to Lupi's. You'll recognize it because you'll be able to look inside and see two large cases filled with lots of gelato flavors. It seems to be run by a young couple from the U.S. They are very nice and let you taste before making a choice. We had almond, banana, and pineapple. They even had small pieces of almonds and pineapple in them. The flavors are very intense and delicious. It's worth the walk. If we had discovered it earlier in our visit we would have been there several nights. I agree with a previous comment that the taxi drivers are not chatty. Their quiet was okay with us. Because of the location of the hotel about a half hour from Old San Juan it is necessary to find some transportation. We took the public bus back and forth on the two days we went in. It cost $.75 each way. The bus stop is a little way past the Ritz in front of Denny's. You have to have exact change. The ride ends at the bus terminal in Old San Juan next to the cruise ship piers and a few steps from the cobblestone streets of the historic city. We felt safe riding the bus during the day and even in the early evening after dinner. The buses were clean and the drivers helpful when we were first timers and didn't know the routine. For future trips to Puerto Rico I think we might stay right in Old San Juan for a couple days so we'd be able to spend all our time in the historic center and then move to a beach/golf resort in another part of the island. After visiting San Juan we spent two nights at the Copamarina Beach Resort in Guanica on the south side of the island and it was a quiet restful retreat from the activity of San Juan. Renting a car and getting away from the big city was a great way to see the beauty of the rest of the island. For a first visit to Puerto Rico, and especially being able to use a Marriott Reward certificate to do it, the Courtyard was a good choice but now that we've seen the possibilities that Puerto Rico has to offer I think we'd try a new experience next time.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ct", "Title": "\u201cI just love this place so much we came back for a second visit\u201d", "Author": "ragtiki1958", "ReviewID": "UR15005837", "Content": "Kudos to Alfredo and his staff! I decided to stay here post cruise after staying here the past September.

Upon my arrival on Sunday was given a warm welcome by the front desk staff and the manager on duty whos name I can not recall came out to welcome me personally. We arrived a bit early after our cruise and before check in time but we allowed to check into our beautifull rooms. Later on in the afternoon upon returning to my room to prepare for my kayak excursion up in Farjado I noticed the staff had delivered a very tasty fruit platter. The food in the hotel is very good. After a very long walk on the beach the following morning I was extremely hungry and tried the breakfast buffet which offered any type of breakfast food you could imagine. I would recommend if you really enjoy a good breakfast. The hotel service that I experienced was top notch. Kudos to the front desk staff, the waiters and waitress in the buffet who work hard to make your meal enjoyable, Axel at the pool bar and the pool towel boys who will set up your chair with a towel on the beach. The bellhops were extremely friendly and allowed me to store my bags after checkout at noon on Monday and was allowed to use the beach and hotel facilities until leaving at 4:00 P.M. for my flight back to CT.

Remember that this is a Courtyard, not The Ritz, so if you're a \"hotel snob\" this may not be your first choice. However, The Courtyard made up for all of it (and more) by providing excellent customer service throughout our stay. For example, upon check-in, we were greeted by the Assistant General Manager, Alfredo who hooked us up with a room featuring a large balcony overlooking the ocean with an incredible view - (see pictures). We were also given $25 in match play coupons for the casino, a couple free drink coupons for my wife and I (try the Rum Punch with your choice of Puerto Rican rum) and 2 beach buckets, shovels and plastic sand molds for the kids. It didn't stop there. After checking in and heading down to the incredible beach/pool area, we returned to find a plate of assorted cookies and a cheese and meat tray in our room complements of the staff. In fact, every staff members that we met were kind and helpful. This is a reflection on the incredible management team that runs this property. It's a perfect place for kids as well. One more cool thing about the property is that it sits on the far East side of Isla Verde beach, so just to the West (towards Old San Juan) are a number of other hotels, however, just to the East of the hotel is an undeveloped beach area so the location kind of provides the best of both worlds. Perhaps the highlight of our stay was renting a car (Martin, the concierge will take care of this for you) and driving East on 187 past Pinones. With no real agenda, we simply pulled over on a deserted beach which was one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. We swam for about 2 hours and saw no more than maybe half a dozen people the entire time we were there. You will also have to go to Old San Juan and enjoy the European style feel the city has to offer. Don't miss out on visiting El Moro de Felipe fort which is an absolute must when in San Juan! The only downside about the Courtyard was that there are not a lot of restaurants within walking distance of the property. Metropol (Cuban and Puerto Rican) was one but we thought the food was kind of bland. The other was Lupi's (Mexican) which was actually one of the best meals we had when we were there. Otherwise, you may have to grab a cab ($20 1-way to Old San Juan) or just eat at hotel restaurants. Enjoy your stay at The Courtyard Isla Verde!

I would have to agree with another reviewer about the Kids Club issue. The hotel staff did not appear to know anything about it. Finally, I was directed to the Casino where they told us that the lady who ran the Kids Club had quit. Obviously, they could not have necessarily known this ahead of time but it would have been nice if they had a backup plan. Having brought a child, it was my number 1 requirement for picking this hotel and the fact that I am a loyal Marriott rewards member. We realized that my 9-year-old would not be interested in a lot of the sightseeing and activities we were so we had our heart set on him having a club for activities so we could do our thing too. Imagine our surprise..no kids club..Their alternative consisted of hiring a babysitter at $15 an hour for a minimum of 4 hours. No thanks. Just another way to charge outrageous fees. So, in turn, we did not get to experience a majority of things that we felt PR would have to offer. We were reduced to hanging out at the hotel with a not so great beach. The water in front of the hotel was disgusting and garbage had washed ashore..and I mean garbage, cans, bottles, old sunglasses. I shutter to think if anyone would walk on the beach barefooted and get a cut. I hate to sound like a whiner but another complaint was the service. It was so slow. I feel everyone did the bear minimum, yet I am sure expected a tip. One night we went down to eat at the cafe and they had one person working and the place was full. Most people did not even get served so they left. We are frequent visitors to Mexico and we'll take our dollars there. I do have to say also that the taxi drivers were not friendly at all. They never said one word to us..NONE of them and we used several. I would also have to agree that all charged different rates to the same places so that was wierd. Just very not friendly.

Here are some of the positives: - extremely well run - friendly and accomodating staff; particularly concierge, wait staff, front desk - fun and free entertainment - clean and perfectly air conditioned room; fine housekeeping - fabulous beach, very good pools - attractive and well maintained grounds; wonderful sunsets! - great location near airport, bus line (we used the A5 into Old Town), rain forest, museums and attractions of San Juan and Old San Juan, nearby small towns. - fair 'hotel' prices in bars and restaurants, where the food could be very, very good There's a small casino we did not visit. I travel a great deal on business and pleasure and if you read my reviews on tripadvisor you know I hold no prisoners. So many American resorts are like our major airlines (e.g American, the one we flew down from Boston on): miserable customer service, lack of attention to detail, ripoff prices. So if I had a beef you would hear about it here! I simply do not. Of course, there are always little glitches, and here are a couple: - there must have been molasses in the wireless/ethernet system; communication was often at a turtle's pace, but they did offer wireless in rooms (!) and there was a nice business center to take up slack.; if you go try to use it off hours - service in the more expensive outdoor restaurant could be very slow, and one evening an appetizer was forgotten (quickly made up by free wine), though we thought the food extremely good. In the indoor restaurant service was over the top friendly (at one point we had female staff fighting over who was helping us the most!) and, happily, they had a standard menu, not buffet every night. The airplane noise issue was there, but it was something most folks just laughed off; my thought was that the hotel should provide a printout of departures so we could try to check on what plane was going where in the world. Our room was pretty well soundproofed. Some things we enjoyed particularly included the magnificent National Gallery and the Puerto Rican Museum of Art (with a wonderful garden and absolutely five star food). The former has a breathtaking lighting system to illuminate landscapes by Oller and other famous PR painters; just magnificent and maybe the highlight of our trip. We went to a a very good beach restaurant over at Pinones (Soliel), and enjoyed a free pickup and return., and Roberto, our tour guide to the rain forest was great; he imparted a tremendous amount of information on Puerto Rico and the gorgeous forest. The fact that the day the PR governor and some buddies were arrested by the feds for corruption led to some wonderful background political info and constant updates on 'breaking news'. Oh, if you do travel American AIrlines avoid the bar-restaurant near gate 7. Ultimately you will have to choose between your flight and food; just about the worst service we've ever had anywhere and for crying out loud they are in an airport! So to sum up, our first trip to Puerto Rico was very enjoyable and it was made better by one of the best resorts of its kind we have ever visited; as a regular Marriott user I was very pleased because some Courtyards can be pretty scruffy.

Our stay was Saturday, March 22nd to Tuesday, March 25th. It was strange that weekend vs. weekday it seemed like two entirely different resorts. Saturday and Sunday the hotel was extremely busy with a very mixed clientele. Many people in just for the Easter weekend at the Casino and the bars. I can't say I was a fan, too many people drinking in the pool and the hot tubs, extremely loud disco music at the pool, kids waiting at tables in the lobby for their parents in the casino, women at breakfast in the restaurant with curlers in their hair - overall a little too trashy a scene for me. Sunday evening and Monday morning it changed dramatically and became a much nicer vacation type hotel. The beach was nice, however the pool was a little small and in the shade most of the day. My twenty year old son took me down to the casino (I had never been to a casino before) and I found it pretty entertaining-he won $100. quickly at blackjack (on an initial $25 investment). The room was a nice typical business hotel room. Nicely decorated with clean and relatively new furniture and free internet in the room. We were on the third floor (room 322) with a nice view of the ocean over the roof. The breakfast buffet was good and reasonably priced ($13.95). We didn't try the restaurants for other meals. The people at the front desk were nice and helpful. Our express check out was wrong and when I went to check out the computers were down. Maribel assured me that she would take care of it and email me a revised bill. When I arrived home in Boston sure enough the corrected receipt was in my email. The hotel is very close to the airport, virtually on the runway and the takeoffs were very loud out by the pool. The noise from the airport wasn't noticable in the room since the patio doors were double doored (I have never seen that before). Surprisingly the cab to the hotel from the airport was $10. and our cab rides were all over the place in terms of price. Forget about the meters or the posted rates, cabdrivers would set their own price and there seemed to be money changing hands between cabdrivers and bellmen at the hotel. As example the first night we asked for a cab to the Intercontinental (about 4 blocks) and the fare was $10., the next night we went to the El San Juan Hotel (also about 4 blocks) and the fare was $8. the next night we went to the Embassy Suites Hotel and the fare was $10 but the return fare was $7, finally our fare to the airport (3 people, less than 1 1/2 miles) was $16. The only part of this that reflected back on the hotel was seeing $$$ pass hands between the cabdriver and the bellman. The best part of the visit was that the room was free with my Marriott rewards points. In summary, nice place,nice beach, reasonable price, nice room, nice people.

I should prefice again, my major reason for choosing the Marriott was its proximity to the Ritz Carlton where I knew I had to go each day at 7:30AM for meetings. Frankly, I couln't stomach the $475+ per night \"conference rate\" which my group was given for the Feb high season. So my $240/night rate saved me about $200 a night. I was very pleased however, with this resort which is on the same beach/as the Ritz Carlton/Hoel Casino a brief 3 minute walk down a common sidewalk. As in typical Marriott fashion my room king/size faced the ocean with a small balcony with wrought iron table and 2 seats. This was an upgrade which they offered me at no additional charge when I checked in. Maybe because I am a Marriott Rewards/timeshare owner. The room wa perfect for business with a small refrig (free daily water bottles), free internet hook up, large flat screen TV with cable, pull out sofa/bed couch with chairs in room. Daily room service with daily replenishing of toiletries., small coffee pot/ with Puerto Rican Cofee, and Herbal Tea bags in bathroom. I had a complimentary Rum drink at the bar. I did not eat at the restaurant as I usually like to try local ethnic food/restaurants when I travel. There was an Ice Cream Parlor on site which many of the kids seemed to enjoy. Never went to the casino, beach was nice with hammocks, pool with swim up bar, quiet location. I could walk down the beach from the Ritz Carlton to the Marriott, again same beach front property. Of course the Ritz Cartlon is very delux with beautifull grounds, pool, never ate there other than in conjunction with conference, and would be a fabulous place to stay for a special occassion or if money is no object, but the Marriott more than met my needs. I ate twice for lunch and dinner at a a local Cuban Restaurant Metropol , a short walk, down the road, and across the street ( take care crossing what is a busy road to get to the restaurant). I thought the food was excellent and a great price/value. For dinner one night had Fresh Snapper, with Cuban Beans/rice, plantain, flan, Virgin Pina Colada, fresh garlic bread, with tip came to about $25.00. Excellent service local Puerto Rican/Cuban Food. Do'nt be afraid to take the A5 bus which stops nearby for $0.75 cents one way takes you into the bus terminal in OldSan Juan where you can get off and take the free Trolley around or walk the streets to El Moro and other sites. The bus will take you through the local areas of Isla Verde, Condadda, etc and you will see where the local people live. The bus seems to run about every 15-20 minutes until maybe 8-9:00pm at night. I took during the day and may once at about 7:00PM back to hotel. You will travel with the local people but there were other non-natives like myself on the bus. A cab will cost you about $20.00 one way, and you can alway's find someone who speaks English, so you can save some money with the bus. My only comment about the Isla Verde Courtyard Marriott, Ritz Carlton is that you will feel like and you are very close to the Airpot. I would have to disagree with others that the location is noisey, and although I couln't see the planes 1 or 2 nights I felt like a plane was either landing or taking off in my room. The flights seem to stop about midnight. so if you are there strictly for vacation/leisure you might want to look around for a quieter location.

A short unspectacular driveway from the street to the hotel and a reception area that is overwhelmed by adjacent casino activities did not provide an initial \"wow\" factor, and we immediately questioned ourselves whether the long journey was worthwhile. (It also made us think twice about tripadvisor comments). The spacious room and comfortable bed compensated our feelings. However the carpet was very damp and the room air much more humid than at other Caribbean hotels we stayed. (We asked about the carpet situation the following day, but did not receive a response). Daylight revealed a nice beach, however the water was more of a surfer's delight. The pool and surrounding garden area were unspectacular. Overall our positive feelings about the hotel are: -The room was a good size, clean and with a comfortable bed (although feather/down pillows were scarce). -The staff members are excellent- friendly, and helpful. -The night music is great- the place really swings during weekends with locals who dance fantastic. -The breakfast buffet was good and reasonably priced (for San Juan). Our negatives were: -The reception area and outside grounds are not to par of other Caribbean hotels in the same price range. They looked \"tired\". The feeling of being \"on vacation\" was diminished. -The casino appears to be the main focus of the hotel. -The airport runway is very close to the hotel (the takeoffsstart at a runway parallel to the hotel about 300 meters away). The hotel has tried to quench the noise, although it is not entirely successful (our room faced the ocean not the runway). -Isla Verde is quite far from areas of interest such as Old Juan (a $20 20-minute cab ride) or any shopping area. The few restaurants near the hotel were several blocks away. Stores (clothing, art, etc) are not near the hotel. -The supper cafe is squeezed in a small paved area between the beach and the hotel. The supper prices are a bit outrageous even for San Juan. -There should be more information about local activities, such as placement in the rooms of booklets such as \"Places to Go- your passport to San Juan\" and \"Que Pasa\" rather than by-chance enounter at the conciege desk.

I, too, had checked out Tripadviser reviews before our trip and even emailed the Assistant Manager, Alfredo Arroyo, with a few questions prior to our arrival...His prompt replys led me to believe this was going to be a SUPER week and we were not disappointed!!!! Perla at the reservation desk checked us in .... gave us info about the resort, including 3 free drink tickets and $25 in match bets to use in the casino....About 5 minutes after we got in our room, Mr. Arroya called and welcomed us to the Marriott and wanted to meet us. WE WERE TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY WITH THIS PERSONAL SERVICE.... We met at the beautiful outside restaurant (Sirena) and Mr. Arroya was so gracious and introduced us to some of the staff....the food was beautifully prepared and excellent in taste. Service was A+ at this restaurant, as well as the Salsa Buffett and Bananas. You can sure tell that Management and all the employees at this resort respect each other and aim to give their very best in personal service to all their guests. We have never EVER been treated so nice before in all our travels.... We had a great room overlooking the beach and pool with a large-screen t.v., small refrigerator (that is stocked each day with FREE bottled water) coffe pot and coffee, CD player, DVD/VCR player, black-out curtains and the most comfortable beds and luxurious linens. The maids were wonderful and gave us extra coffee and bottled water when we asked and we were more than pleased to reciprocate with a nice tip each time. The Casino was fun and something we have never encountered before....they serve FREE drinks, sandwiches and soup on the casino floor, but be sure and give these hard-working people a nice tip. One of our favorite servers in the casino was \"Angel\" and he was an angel...We couldn't get over the trays he would carry with so many drinks, and food on it and then remember who got what. Free internet station 24 hours/day is really a BONUS! They have 3 screens and we always were able to use one of them whenever we wanted to check email. About the noisy planes...we were aware of this before we came, but the patio doors are double and this takes away a lot of the noise. My sister and I made a game of it....We tried to guess whether the planes were an \"inny\" or an \"outty.\" From our patio we could see the planes take off (outty) but we couldn't see them land (inny). This was my husband and my third trip to Puerto Rico and my sister's first. We have stayed at the Sheraton in Old San Juan and the Condado Plaza Hotel & Casino. They are all nice resorts, but our experience this past week at the Marriott Courtyard far exceeds any expectations. We walked to the bus stop..across the street from Denney's and took the A-5 bus into Old San Juan for 75cents each and did the self-walking tour...then we took the ferry for 25cents each to the Bacardi Rum Factory and did the tour (free) and received 2 free drink tickets. Bought some wonderful homemade soap & a wallet from the street vendors in Old San Juan and took in the casino at the Sheraton for a short-while...This was all done in a day and it happened to be the \"best weather day\" we had all week. For some reason...every day around 2p.m. the sky opened up and it rained for about an hour or two and every morning it was just beautiful and sunny. Other places we visited were: El San Juan Hotel & Casino, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel & Casino, Hotel El Convento in Old San Juan and Restaurant Ajili-Mojili in Condado. The Picante lobby bar has a live band and the Salsa dancing is fun to watch. The people know how to have fun and are super good dancers. Drinks here are great too!!! Thank you again for our wonderful week in Puerto Rico. Alfredo Arroyo...you are one first-class act...and KUDOS! to your wonderful staff.....As our CA Governor would say..\"I'LL BE BACK!!!!!", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "OhioGirl7", "ReviewID": "UR10408539", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel from 9/20/07 to 9/25/07 with three girlfriends; we are all 22 years old.

Also, the bathroom was not very clean and was a little moldy. We then noticed a watermark on the wall. When we called the frontdesk to tell them there was a leak, they said they would get back to us. We heard nothing back. The next morning we called again. The front desk said they would look into getting us another room. They said they would call us back.

We called the front desk for a third time and finally they relocated us and told us a pipe was broken. The new room was better but I was very upset that they took so long to accomodate us.

It was our first trip to Puerto Rico and our first experience with the hotel. We were not disappointed. The positive reviews of the property on this website from previous guests were right on the money. The staff were professional, accommodating and just downright friendly. We were made to feel like valued guests. The first night at the hotel we had dinner in the Salsa restaurant. Our hostess, Ruby, remembered our names from that point on. She stopped by our table two nights later while we were in the lounge and greeted us by name. It may seem like a little thing, but it made us feel \"special\". The lounge showcased live high-energy Latin music every night from a variety of bands and most nights the dancefloor was hopping. The last night there, a Monday, a trio of balladeers entertained on acoustic guitars with percussion accompaniment. This was a nice change of pace from the frenetic dance music of the previous nights. The casino was buzzing all the times I was there and although I didn't win any money, I had fun with what little dinero I was willing to let go of. Note: It is illegal to serve alcohol in a casino in Puerto Rico. You may bring your drink inside as long as it's in a plastic cup. The beach was beautiful and very clean. The sea lapping against the shore was a soothing balm for the senses. The water was a sparkling aquamarine hue just like in the Caribbean travel brochures. My wife spent most of her days there and commented to me that she felt completely safe there by herself. I was impressed with the professonalism and friendliness of Elizabeth and Amy, the two desk clerks who handled my reservation inquiries. Amy went above and beyond in assuring me that she would \"block\" a room to my liking, although it is not hotel policy to reserve a particular room for guests in advance. The room we were booked into was exactly as I had requested. We were in Rm. 722 which is the closest non-smoking ocean view room to the beach on that floor. The rooms facing fully the beach are considered ocean front and are premium priced. Our room afforded a very good angled view of the beach and the sea, as well as the palm-studded pool area, which was particularly attractive at night. The bed was the most comfortable that I have ever slept in in a hotel. There were plenty of pillows and plenty of room. I can't say enough about the bed. And last but not least, the service was great. We called the front desk twice during our stay. Once, to ask for more in-room tea bags and once for more of the excellent in-room coffee. Both times, an employee arrived at our room in less than 5 minutes with more than what we asked for. Now, I do have a few comments about what I didn't like: (1) Although, there are 5 restaurants at the resort, the menu in 3 of them, except for the salad option, is akin to fast-food (sandwiches, hot dogs, chicken fingers, etc.). Also, of the five, only the three fast-food types are open for lunch: Picante (lounge), Playa Grill (swimming pool) and Banana (deli). (2) Although as a guest you are paying for the amenities of a resort in your room rate, the hotel management charges you extra to use their chaise lounge chairs for the beach. (3) Granted, I've never stayed at a resort before and my opinion on this next subject might be uninformed, but I felt the charge for the Salsa restaurant buffet was excessive. The restaurant offers a breakfast and dinner buffet at $12.95 and $21.95, respectively. The choices at both are abundant, but at the times I dined there the quality of the offerings were only slightly above average. Overall, though, we were well pleased with our experience at this hotel and would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami", "Title": "\u201cNice little hotel.\u201d", "Author": "dantemiami", "ReviewID": "UR10047431", "Content": "I was a little hesitant to book this hotel, since my previous experiences with Courtyard has not been great; not at this Courtyard.

We had plenty of towels and the hot tub was fabulous. We also enjoyed a day at the beach and my husband Richard laid in the hammock and fell asleep with a rum island ice tea in his hand. After some dancing at night we would go to the casino and stay there to the wee hours. It is hard to get a slot machine because the locals take them all, but if you are patient, one always become avaiable. The drinks keep coming around as long as you are gambling and they also give you sandwiches if you asked for them. We even took the bus which is only .65 cents and visited old san juan.

It was not like we did not enjoy our stay, because we did, but it was average to what we are normally used to. First off, this hotel does have the best spot on the strip as far as the beach is concerned. The sand was clean, the water was nice and there were palm trees around for shade. I did not like the fact you needed to pay for your beach chairs or umbrella but that is the case. FREE use would be nice. The pool was cool, it is open 24 hours a day which is rare and nice. I hardly ever used the swim up bar but it is a nice feature. The food shack had some good eats just incase you where hungry, they had a DJ playing music which made the atmoshpere a bit more vacation like. Overall, the pool was a good place to hang out by. Cleaning service was lacking, serveral times we would leave our room by 10am and come back by 4pm and the room was still not cleaned. I am not a 5 star type of guy but the basics are a must. Some work needs to be done in that area. TV channels where good and the DVD player saved us with our 2 year old. The view was fantastic and the condo building that you here about in other reviews was not all that bad. The Salsa buffet restaurant was fine. The pork is great and the rice dishes are a must. It did not have the variety I am used to but it was good. Never ate at the Sirena restaurant. I decided to go more ethnic and eat dinner outside of the hotel. Metropol restaurant which is a few blocks away from the hotel never dissapointed. Ok, like I said, not all of it was great but we did have a good time at the place. The casino is a blast if you like that sort of stuff and what I liked the most was the Picante Bar. My hats off to Sandra the bartender she took care of me on my first night and when I got back to the bar on Sunday she took one look at me and remembered what I liked to drink and mixed it right up. She makes great drinks and is a very nice to talk to. To sum it all up, The Marriot was ok, but my main reason for going was to see the Island and that did not dissapoint.

We read many reviews on trip advisor and we chose to stay here. For the most part we had a great stay. We did have some issues though. We arrived at the hotel around 11:00am. We had an early flight into San Juan that morning. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that our room was not ready which was to be expected since check in was at 3pm. They did store our luggage and we were able to change and go to the beach/pool. we were told that we would get a phone call when our room was ready. well we never got that call. finally aroud 3:30pm we inquired about our room and we were given one at 4pm. We got to the room on the 6th floor and as soon as we opened the door the room was humid. We walked in thinking perhaps the AC was not on. As we walked into the room I slipped on the carpet. The carpet was completley wet. My boyfriend then decided to use the restroom and the floor had foot prints all over the floor. I sat on the bed which was rock hard and turned on the tv and none of the channels were working. I finally got off the bed and realized that my pants soaked b/c the bed was wet due to the humidity in the room. I then heard a noise from coming from the celing and it was a malfunctioning smoke alarm.This was enough for me. we took our things and went downstairs and told the front desk that we needed to have our room changed. we let her know everything that was wrong and appologized. We were given a new room at 5pm. at this point i was exhausted and i wanted to sleep. This new room was an upgrade. It was located on the 7th floor. I was scared to open the door but im glad we did. the room was very clean and smelled good. we had a beautifal view of the ocean. I couldent believe that this room was in the same hotel. everything worked properly in this room and from here on our stay was great. The Pool, and beach are great. Yes the airport is accross the steet and you hear some planes but honestly im from New York and eventually you dont hear the planes anymore. The staff here is very friendly. The casino is a pretty good size but you do get some locals in the weekend. Particularly this young group of buys that think they run the place. other then that the casino is great. All the resturants in the hotel are great too. Wh had on issue at the buffet at salsa and that was resolved with a free meal. This hotel is very customer service oriented and try their best to accoadate your every need.

We had a good stay. Service: Very good--friendly, and helpful. The front desk people were very polite and efficient. The concierge did a great job of setting us up for a flight to Culebra at the last minute. Food: Also good. The buffet has good Puerto Rican food, including a whole pig every night, and in the lounge the churrasco skirt steak is fantastic. Room service was good for breakfast, accomodating and fast. The coffee is good at this hotel. Casino: Kind of dreary and small. Rooms: Not luxurious, but clean with good linens and toiletries. Our room had none of the mold or musty odors that other complained of, but the hallway did. It's a tropical environment, so I doubt this is a sign of poor upkeep. Housecleaning was more friendly than in most places. The pool and beach areas: Very nice. In May, there were no crowds. Plenty of chairs and umbrellas, plus hammocks. The have a towel attendent. They swim-up bar is fun and the bartenders are good. They have a hot tub, too. We ventured out into a few areas ,and this info might be useful: 1.) San Juan is very much like being in the mainland U.S (except the people are friendlier and the service is better). Everyone speaks English. Most of the stores and restaurant chains are ones Americans go to at home. At some point, we got a little bored! If you want a change of scenery, check out Culebra island. It's a quiet little island with an amazing beach. We went at the urging of a couple of locals and it was worth the trip in a tiny airplane! It defintely made us feel like we got away from it all. The flights are cheap (100 round trip) and lodging on the island is available for under 100 also. If you go, though, apply bug spray and sunscreen before you get on the airplane (we wish we had). The concierge can set this up. 2.) In Old San Juan, if you want good food, go where the locals are eating. In the afternoon, business people and police officers go out for lunch; follow their lead. We found this was the best way to get good local food at reasonable prices. If you want to have a nice meal at an American restaurant, skip Ruth's Chris; the food was not as good as in the States.

The view was stunning from our balcony and we enjoyed lying out in the hot sun listening to the waves lapping the shore. The pool is fun - lots of lush vegetation, some strolling iguana, and plenty of chairs and towels. We basked in the sun, ordered great fruity drinks, and \"swam up\" and enjoyed lunch at the pool bar. The staff - Maribel at the front desk was welcoming and endearing upon arrival, the waitstaff in the restaurant were very professional and, when we left one of our passports in the hotel safe, the housekeeping manager retrieved it promptly and professionally. We were able to extend our checkout and stow our luggage and enjoy the pool and beach until our evening flight. An issue with our room was also handled quickly and professionally (see below) with \"the customer is always right\" approach. For convenience to and from the airport, it doesn't get any better than this. Our taxi experience in both directions was phenomenal - from the very organized system at the airport, to the ready and available line of taxis at the hotel, this was one of the easiest airport-to-hotel-to-airport experiences we have ever encountered. The downsides: We were shown to a room that was so humid, everything felt wet - the carpets, furniture, bedding. Also, the smell of bleach in the room was enough to burn my nostrils and force me into the bathroom where the fan ran continuously with the light on. We phoned the front desk who sent a housekeeping employee who proceeded to spritz some sort of spray all around the room (more bleach?). We requested to change rooms - they put us 2 floors up, a partial ocean view room, but no odors or humidity issue. The finer dining option was closed Sundays and Mondays, so we were given the option of the dinner buffet. The food was really, really average - I don't have a familiarity with Puerto Rican fare, but this was bland, mushy and overcooked. At $25/person, we were shocked to receive the bill for such unmemorable food. The casino, I'm sure, is fun for many, but felt depressing to us. It is small and crowded and seems to draw a large crowd of people not staying in the hotel. We walked in, intent on spending/losing $5 for fun, but left after a quick walk through left us feeling sad and overwhelmed. Overall, this hotel is saved by the beautiful beach and poolside amenities and, clearly, its proximity to the airport. We are very grateful to the staff who so professionally located and returned our passport. We also were not bothered by the airplane noise (it's kind of a low rumble that you don't hear after a while) or any insects, as reported by some other reviewers.

The place is safe and clean enough, has comfortable furniture, large rooms, lightning-fast elevators, and all the necessary amenities as well as a few nice details (energy-saving lightbulbs and water-saving faucets, and an iPod port on the clock-radio-CD player in the room). I was also allowed to check in to my room early (1:30 pm instead of 3 pm). However, my room (#705) absolutely reeked of mold. I have stayed in Courtyard Marriotts before and have never had any complaints. But here, unfortunately, staff were unable to correct the problem (their \"solution\" involved spraying the air conditioner with Lysol or something similar). Nor could they switch me to a different room (the hotel was completely full). The odor was so overpowering that I felt I ought to have been sent to another nearby hotel at the Marriott's expense. The air conditioning unit--perhaps even the whole duct system--needs to be thoroughly cleaned, serviced, and preferably updated. The carpets were damp to the touch. The fan in the bathroom, although it runs constantly, was useless. I opened the cover and found the inside coated with a thick layer of dust. I tried to air the room out by opening the balcony door, but I couldn't keep it open for long owing to the airplane noise and the fact that there was no screen door, so the sandflies flew right in. In general I felt that that the owners ought to direct their energies and funds toward updating--rather than expanding--the hotel. The gym, too, was in a sad state of neglect, with old machines (the stair-climber was so rusty that it got stuck, and I bruised my leg when it finally popped back up unexpectedly; I later noticed--and pointed out to an employee--that the bars at the bottom were completely covered with rust). There was also no elliptical machine. The food was overpriced and mediocre, and service was p-a-i-n-f-u-l-l-y s-l-o-w--even though the restaurants were half-empty both times I visited. It is true that the beach is clean and spacious, and quiet & relaxing whenever there's a lull in the plane take-offs.

The price was great for this time of year. We had read mostly good reviews, but were surprised at just how much we enjoyed the hotel, property and service! The beach was wonderful and very large. Comfy loungers are set up as you get your towels. We walked east and there was no one around, if you wish some privacy. To the west was the Ritz, and their beach was a joke in comparison. We had a nice amount of waves to play in, but nothing dangerous. The no-see-um bugs are around, so be sure to put on bug repellent from your knees down. We did not and had a few bites, but nothing I hadn't gotten in Florida or South Carolina. The pool was fine and not crowded. (It was high season too, I think.) Looked great for kids. We lounged around the pool and had a drink at the swim up bar. Paradise. The airplane noise is there, though I guess you have to determine what you are expecting. If you want silence and peace, go find a secluded cabin rather than a resort. We were ready for it and did not find the noise objectionable at all. Thanks to the wonderful oceanfront room upgrade, if we had our sliding door open, the ocean noise drowned out almost all airplane noise. Would one complain that the ocean is too noisy? The breakfast buffet was bountiful and complete. Made-to-order omelets and waffles, along with a nice variety of warm items including good sausage and bacon. The cold items had eveything one could wish for, and a very wide variety of juices (good OJ!) left one wanting for nothing. The price is your call, as I end up pigging out to get my money's worth, then needed a good nap by the pool. But that's vacation!! Our only minor complaint was the wait staff service at Picante early in the week. Not sure why we were ignored so, but what can one do. We found some of the same kind of service at a couple other restaurants in this tourist area, so perhaps that's the way things are. The Manager's Reception was exactly the opposite, where the food was good and plentiful, the service was outstanding and the mojitos were addictive. (To one of us anyway...) Maybe tipping accordingly will get their attention for the next time? Again, only a minor issue, as there were plenty of other places to try. (We had a great meal and service in Old San Juan.)

Be aware, the surf can be strong at the beach and there are no lifeguards at the pool or the beach. What stands out from our experience here are the excellent buffet breakfast and dinner at Salsa Restaurant. There are some pricing options to be aware of, as they are not posted: The full breakfast buffet costs 12.95 for adults, 6.50 for kids under 12. Adults eating the \"cold buffet\" at Salsa are charged only 7.95. The hot buffet includes: made to order omelets and waffles, breakfast meats, french toast, potatoes, and hot cereal. The cold buffet is bountiful containing cold meats and cheeses, bagels, toast and pastries, fresh fruits, cereal, and yogurt. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, milk and a selection of fruit juices are provided. You can eat your breakfast inside or on the veranda which looks out on the beach (recommended!). Continental breakfast is also available at Bananas ice cream parlor for about $5, where you can watch CNN on TV while you eat; however, the selection of food is more limited and is not a good value compared to the cold buffet at Salsa. The dinner buffet at Salsa features Puerto Rican specialties and costs 21.95; during our stay a special promotion was available, kids under 12 free with a paying adult. Again, this pricing is not posted and you have to ask. The centerpiece of the buffet is a whole roasted pig (\"lechon\"). You have to try this! The meat is tender and tasty and the skin is crisp. Other local food items on the dinner buffet included goat (tastes like lamb), red beans and rice, and plantains. We also ate dinner at Sirena's, a \"white tablecloth\" style restaurant located on the patio. You can't beat the ambiance: palm trees, beach, soft lighting and island music. The a la carte menu is more pricey than the buffet, but the food was great, and compared to other restaurants on the island, was not overpriced. Dinner for four inluding appetizers and main course will run about $35 not including drinks, tips and tax. A wine list is available. A note about extra charges you will run into here: our room rate of 261.25 for an oceanview double (AAA rate) did not include govt tax of 31.61 and a 26.13 resort fee, so the grand total for our room was 318.99 per day. Self-parking in the onsite garage is $15 per day plus 7% tax. You will need a car or taxi to get most places; although you can walk to the Ritz Carlton where a lovely but pricey spa offers everything from payaya and mango facials ($75) to rainforest stone massage ($175). My girls got manicures ($40 each). For a splurge gourmet dinner you might want to try the Vineyard Restaurant at the Ritz (we didn't). I noticed that the pool and beach in front of the Ritz Carlton were much more crowded than ours and didn't provide a lot of shade.

Great shower with lots of (almost too much) water pressure. We were in room 1124 with an ocean view and balcony. The resort had something for everyone. The pools were great ...had a smaller one for the kids (ages 4 & 7) that was 3 1/2 ft and had a small slide, great beach playground and a nice swim up bar. Good music playing but not blarring as at some hotels. Thought the hotel was at capacity, we never had trouble finding a pool chair or hammock to lounge in. Bananas had pizza and ice cream that made our kids very happy! The lounge bar was nice with music every night! Great way to get your fill of music with little ones in tow! It was great fun to watch as the locals filled the dance floor. The music was great! The breakfast buffet was good and reasonable at $12 for adults.

The Good \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 Pool is great. They have a nice pool with a swim up bar. They also have two other kid pools. One is a pool perfect for kids who have just learned to swim. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very big, has a slide, and has seating for parents. They also have a baby pool, which was perfect for our son. There are plenty of chairs around each of three pools. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 They have a nice playground. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 I really liked how you could see the ocean from the pool and you were just steps away from the beach. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 They gave my son a bucket, shovel and beach ball when we checked in. They never left his side. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 The breakfast buffet was really good and priced reasonably at $13 per person. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 The food you can get for lunch throughout the hotel is okay. Nothing great but nothing too bad. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 There is a pharmacy within walking distance to get snacks, floats, soft drinks, etc.. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 There is a grocery store within walking distance- about 15 minutes or 3 minutes by cab. We walked it and it is doable despite what they tell you. But if you just need small stuff go to the pharmacy. If you do buy milk, buy a \u00c2\u00bd gallon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a whole gallon won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit in the fridge. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 The rooms had DVD players. The Bad \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 The hotel is the last hotel in a line of hotels. You have about a 10-minute walk to other restaurants/hotel restaurants. The sidewalks are not very stroller friendly \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 If you do go somewhere else close by- like a two minute cab ride, you are looking at a minimum of $6-7 each way. It was about $35 roundtrip to old San Juan. It adds up after a while and can be difficult to do with a car seat. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 The food at the hotel at night isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very good so you have to go out and most places- even American chains- are about 50% higher than what you would pay in the states. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the service was that great at the hotel. I had to call the front desk a couple of times for things and it was like they could have cared less- they had a take it or leave it attitude- despite the letter you get from management when you check in. \u00ef\u201a\u00b7 The people in San Juan weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most helpful people either. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like they were really into being a tourist destination. Being that I live in Maryland and it is really cold here in the winter- I would only go back if it were a really good deal getting there and staying there at the Marriott.

We had booked an ocean front room, well worth the extra money, and quite reasonable by Puerto Rico standards for the high season. The view was awesome, the beach was great, although the ocean was very rough during our stay, and that meant algie on the beach. They do an excellent job grooming the beach every morning, however they don't pick it up, thus it goes in and back out during the tides. We had a couple of minor problems during our stay. One was corrected by staff within minutes, and the other, when management got involved, it was satisfactorily corrected. It was rather refreshing to see management take such an active role in the running of the hotel. Although common in small properties, it's quite rare among the bigger ones. Gracias Mr. Caban. As for the biting gnats, they are for real. Just like in Florida, they bite during early morning and evening. They got me in the balcony, but no big deal. The noise of the planes was not an issue for us, we didn't mind at all. Do not sleep with the sliders open though, because you'll hear them in the morning. Close the sliders, turn on the AC, and you'll hardly hear them. Breakfasts were excellent, and reasonably priced, and the lounge really rocks at night (with salsa sounds, of course) A message for the Concierge: Yes, there is public transportation in Puerto Rico to go places all over the island. When we asked, were told by a young lady at the concierge desk that it didn't exist, and that we had to either rent a car or use taxis, which we didn't want to do. We wanted to go out of San Juan, inland, to see other towns. We asked a local, and he told us about the guagua (bus) terminals, depending on the destination, and how to get there (via subway- which by the way, was fantastic, so clean and beautiful). Granted, I'm fluent in the language and while it's perhaps not the most confortable means of transportation (the guagua) - they are small vans, have erratic schedules - it truly gives you a sense of the real Puerto Rico, and its people. We used it to go to Caguas, a small town about an hour or so from San Juan, and enjoyed it tremendously, the people we met were wonderful and the entire experience was just what we were looking for.

The hotel was much better than expected. All rooms have a view of the ocean and the facilities at the hotel were great. The rooms appeared to be recently renovated, was larger than expected and very clean. The view was wonderful. There were a number of restaurants and although I did not each lunch or dinner there, I did eat breakfast there both days. The breakfast buffet with omelette and waffle bar was great. I believe it only cost about $12-13 which is not too bad for a decent hotel breakfast. The casino was also much better than expected, especially for a hotel of this side. When we checked in we even got $25 in match play coupons. The table game and slot machine selection was one of the best I've seen on the island. The Courtyard is in the Isla Verde section which has what I think is the best beach in San Juan. The main beach in Puerto Rico (the Condado Section) is very rocky and much rougher although this is where most of the large resorts are (ie the Marriott Stellarios, Caribe Hilton, Condado Plaza, etc). Isla Verde is also further away from Old San Juan than the hotels in Condado but you can take a taxi there for $19, the ride takes about 10-15 minutes depending on traffic. The downside of Isla Verde is that all of the hotels (the Courtyard included) are located on a strip directly adjacent to the runway. Although some reviewers indicated you couldn't hear the planes very well, I definitely heard them even in my room. In fact one was so loud I thought it was crashing into the hotel (at about 5:45 am). Outside the noise can be deafening. The pool and beach area are oustanding for a hotel of this size. I especially like the hammocks which were great for enjoying the warm Caribbean breeze. This hotel is ideal of business travelers and for vacationers looking for a short trip. I would not recommend this for anyone looking for a relaxing, get away from it all luxury vacation. The noise is just not conducive to it. Also, please note that in the winter the ocean can be VERY cold. If you are looking for a beach vacation I would definitely look for someplace outside San Juan, preferrably on the Eastern or Southern Coasts. The water there just seems to much warmer in the winter. I would DEFINITELY stay at this hotel again if traveling on business or as a stop over for a few nights in San Juan before traveling elsewhere on the island. If you are vising San Juan and staying at the hotel you probably don't need a car. The airport is a short cab ride as is Old San Juan. You can take a short walk to numerous restaurants around the hotel. It's probably cheaper and less of a hassle.

We had a great time. The hotel met our needs very well, but it might not be equally excellent for everyone. First, let me say that everyone at the hotel -- heck, everyone in Puerto Rico -- was wonderful to us. It was a friendly, relaxed and pleasant place to vacation. We traveled with our two *special* children, one autistic and one with ADHD, and occasionally one or the other does something odd; we don't expect things to always be trouble-free in the interpersonal relations department. In this case, however, it was. Two men even appeared from nowhere to help us free our rented car from the sand when we got stuck while taking beach photos. One thing you ought to know about this hotel, however, is that it is very near the airport. The soundproofing in the building is quite good. There are, for example, double sliding glass doors on the room's balcony that seal out much of the noise. While we could still hear the planes from our room, the sound was faint and not annoying. Outside in the hot tub, however, you absolutely had to suspend conversation when one took off. This did not bother us (after all, we have children, and noise is no novelty) but it might be an issue for someone else. Also, the beach in front of the hotel, while very scenic, isn't the best for swimming. There is, or was during our visit, quite a bit of seaweed floating in the water. The huge hammocks swinging there, however, are wonderfully enticing, and lying there in the evening watching the moon float overhead is the kind of experience you hope for on a Caribbean vacation. The hotel's pools are nice and they were not crowded when we used them. However, they are a bit small. You are not going to mistake them for Blizzard Beach in Disneyworld. The beach situation did not bother us, though, because we had a rental car and knew that the beach at Liquillo was gorgeous. We drove down there (about 30 miles) and had a great time on two different visits. The room was clean. Pretty standard for a nice hotel/motel. No issues there. The biting insects -- most likely it was the no-see-ums -- did take a chunk out of us on the beaches. We neglected to use bug spray, and one thing I would recommend to others is to buy some kind of insect repellent and use it. If you forget, Benadryl's anti-itch spray relieves the symptoms pretty well, as we can personally attest. The food at the hotel was good, but expensive. If you want a cheaper breakfast and you have a car, take a right turn out of the hotel and drive about a half mile and you will find a Dennys on your right. There is a bar and a casino in the spacious lobby area. I am not a gambler, so the casino was no big deal for me. The bar had live nightly music, usually featuring a lively Latin beat, and the dance floor filled and spilled into the surrounding lobby by 9:30 or so in the evening. I believe it went into the wee hours of the morning, but I can't say I stayed up to find out.The musicians were good -- at least, these are not the sad sacks you sometimes see singing \"yellow bird\" and panhandling some places in the Caribbean. They were professionals. If you like dancing to a salsa beat, you could spend many happy hours in the lobby. The place rocked - the scene at New Year's Eve surpasses any party I have ever seen before. The hotel also runs a kids club, where you can have the children entertained, provided you are willing to spend your free time on the hotel grounds. You must pledge to stay on grounds while the children are with them. Having seen the \"kids club\" on a Disney cruise ship, mine were chomping at the bit to go to this one. When we got there, though, it reminded me more of the toddler nursery at our church than the Disney kids club. My son pulled my arm and whispered in my ear \"This place is lame.\" We left them anyway, and when we returned a few hours later to pick them up, they did not want to leave. My 10 year old son had been playing Twister and my 8 year old daughter had been imaging herself a sophisticated grown-up, drinking pina coladas (with no alcohol) prepared by the adult running the show.

I've spent lots more and had more luxurious accomodations on other vacations, and I'm pretty picky, but this hotel was was pleasant surprise. And you can't beat the price. We had friends who paid more for their tiny room, over looking the city(not beach) at the Intercontinental. When they saw our room, they said they'd stay at the Courtyard on their next trip. It is a great hotel for families although we never did find the advertised \"kids' club.\" The pool is nice; the beach was a bit rough and the water is not crystal clear, but it was still fun. One of the nicest things about the hotel is that it is at the end of the \"hotel strip\" so it feels much more secluded than the other hotels on the strip. The view from our large balcony (15ft long probably) was ALL ocean and unspoiled beach- not commercial at all! The airplane noise is real, but you get used to it and it's not really annoying. We could not hear it when we were inside our room. If you're looking for constant action, it's not the best hotel for you- the Courtyard is quiet, although it does have a small casino open 24 hrs. and a lobby bar.

The suite was very large and had a decent sized kitchen with a full sized fridge/freezer.Apart from some cups and glasses from the bathroom,there are no utensils,plates or cutlery of any kind. We had a rental car and ended up buying plastic plates etc.bottled water and some cereal from a local Walgreens. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms adequate.This is not a luxury hotel by any means,but having a large(clean) space for the four of us to spend a week in was paramount.Not to mention the spectacular view from our balconies. The air conditioning worked well,although in the evenings my husband and I would switch ours off and open the sliding doors and sleep with the sound of the ocean.Because of the humidity everything gets very damp.Not too big a deal though. We found the staff to be helpful and polite,especially Tijuana at the front desk.If you have any problems at all with booking your rooms,ask for Tijuana,she's a miracle worker! Unfortunately,the one place where this hotel really needs improvement is in it's restaurants.The food is not acceptable and overpriced. We drove in to Old San Juan almost every evening and had some fabulous(be prepared however,pretty costly)meals. AquaViva is an absolute must for seafood lovers.It is located on one of the side streets off of the Plaza de Colon in Old San Juan. Nearby is the Parrot Club(same owners as AquaViva)another great place. All in all we found the Courtyard Isla Verde to be great value for the money.The staff were very accomodating and the Assistant Manager arranged day passes at the Ritz Carlton(2 hotels up the beach)for us when the Coutyard decided to drain and clean their pool.Have to say the Ritz Carlton Pool really is fabulous if one gets a chance to visit. It was fairly quiet when we were there,I could see that perhaps it wouldn't be quite as good during peak season.Only worth staying here if you can get a room with a view of the ocean,helps to make up for some of the things that aren't quite up to par.

We stayed at the Courtyard from Agust 28-Sept. 1. The noise from the airport did not bother us and we slept soundly. Where do I start..... Check- in went really smoothly and we had a nice room with a view of the ocean. The room is clean and spacious, the bathroom is large yet the bathtub was moldy, had soap scum and mold starting to form on the ceiling. Our housekeeping did a wonderful job making sure we had clean towels and came to clean up the room daily. Most of the staff is nice and always had a smile. One problem I encountered was at the Banana Cafe in the lobby, the young lady was counting her cash register and we were standing in front of her waiting to be served, I did not want to disturb her since she was in the middle of counting and figured she will acknowledge us once she finishes the set of change she was counting...well she went to the next set without bothering with us. I asked her is she is going to serve us and she said \"just a minute\" meanwhile the other person working with her, passed us several times didn't bother either....Breakfast was too expensive at the hotel so we ate at Denny's most of the time There was a wonderful friendly hardworking young man named Marcelino who set up a chairs ($6)and umbrella ($9) and can get quite expensive, which mean 21 dollars a day. The pool was nice although we never used it since the beach is right there and beautiful to see, it is not white sand, a lot of seaweed and very sandy, I would rate it a C. and THERE ARE SAND FLEAS!!!! At first I thought I was getting bitten by mosquitoes (I am allergic, swells almost like a welt and turns red blue), which did not happen, then I thought they were bed bugs, that was not the case either, and recalling some of the reviews regarding Sand Fleas, I figured that must be it...I am not a doctor yet it is a good speculation. Since my friend and I do not drive, taxi fare was turning out to be expensive, 20 dollars (one way) to go to Plaza Las Americas which is a 10 minute cab ride. We tried to save by taking the bus to Old San Juan which was 75 cents and get a chance to see the inner barrios. The hotel is far from the nearby restaurants, and NOT walking distance as many claimed. I'm from NY and I am not afraid to walk long distances in a fast pace, yet restaurants are not close. We ate at the Oyster bar which was not that great and that the Mexican restaurant on the rooftop at the El San Juan Hotel which was reasonably price and the food was good. Some cab drivers charge you different rates as well. The cab going to El San Juan hotel charged us $5 on our way back another cab driver charged us $8....the cab ride being 3 minutes away! The cabs we used are designated for Tourists to avoid being scammed....well I can't help but wonder if this really works! The entertainment at the hotel needs improvement and for two young women on vacation, much is left to be desired. The bar Picante was very stingy with their alcohol and PR being the main distributor of Rum, they seemed very cheap and their drinks ranging from $7-10, was watered down...We were also wondering were everyone was there was no more than a handful of people in the bar it started getting better by Thursday...we assumed they were saving the rum for the weekend. Located in a quiet location, the hotel is better for business travellers and families or for those that have a car rental. Otherwise it gets expensive and the nightlife is not that great. I will not return to this hotel for vacation, it is far from most attractions and restaurants. We were looking forward to a Caribean island and found ourselves in a replica of Miami with a Burger King at every street corner.

We ended up by getting one of the last few rooms at this hotel. Be advised that this hotel is directly across from the airport. You do hear planes take off but it isnt so bad if you have a room not close to the airport side of the building. We complained at the location of our room and were immediately changed and upgraded.

When you check in, they give you some coupons for free drinks and a $ 25 match bet for the casino. The casino is a smaller knockoff of Vegas. The dealers were all natives and spoke more spanish than english. I noticed that if you had a good hand which you might want to hit on, they sometimes decided for you (literally moving to the next person). One of the dealers was really annoying because he wouldnt stop talking to one of the patrons. They allow you to sit even if you are not gambling.

You should also visit Luquillo, go to the rainforest and rent bikes to ride to Pinones. Watching the sunrise is fantastic and romantic if you are with the ones you love. You should also go on the FunCat catamaran and go sailing and snorkeling. Food is great. There is a lot of restaurants that are good. Old San Juan is home to the Dragonfly, which is fantastic.

The welcome was, \"we are almost closed\". Thanks God, the hostess came to assit us, she was the only person professionally capable to deal with guests. NO room service!!!.

I think even numbered rooms would have better views than ours (odd side). No nightlife close by and hotel bar is not fun. THE AREA: Old San Juan is a cruise ship tourist trap. If you rent a car, there is nowhere to park near clubs, etc. It seems the better area for action and fun is near the Intercontinental but at their price, you may as well stay at the all-inclusive Paradisus (which we did also) and get your party for free with the resort cost. The primary excursions are the Rainforest and catamarans both of which will be 1 1/2 to 2 hours from San Juan because of traffic. Fajardo, where the ferries and catamarans leave from is a long ride away. If you are looking for good value on a nice beach, I would go elsewhere.

We are in our early 30's. This was a vacation, not business travel. I read all the previous reviews on this property before choosing this hotel. The majority were glowing reviews about the hotel and how awesome the beach was. Here is our experience by topic.... The Room....we booked a ocean view room, we got a view of an EXTREMELY run down condo/apartment building next door, a view of a dumpster -but if we stood in the corner of the balcony we could see the ocean from the balcony.... My husband said that they should switch the balcony to the other window, he would rather of had a view of the planes taking off from the airport! We could not use the balcony because there were nasty people sitting in there run down apt staring at us some in their underwear ...not pleasant. The room was clean, but the bathroom had some mildew in the shower and it was very very small. At night when I turned off the light off by the bed it fell out of wall. Great first impression. Alrighty then! On to the next topic. The Beach/Pool- The main reason we chose this property was because of the GREAT reviews of the pool/beach. We are used to the beutiful white powder beaches in the Bahamas and Mexico. Here is what we saw--My husband and I walked out on to the beach our first night and when we looked to the left.... down the beach their were a string of run down condo/apt buildings lined up ..when we looked down to the right their was a small community of homeless people living in tents and huts made out of sticks and palm tree leaves right next to the Marriott property. That is all I will say on that topic. Not exactly a vacation atmosphere or paradise. I could not believe that this had not been mentioned in any previous reviews! If I would have read that I would have definitely not stayed here!!! The beach water is not calm with warm water. The sand was brown and the water was not clear or calm. The pool is not anything special. Normally we spend our days lying around the beach and pool on vacation then do a little exploring in the later afternoon. We really did not want to hang out at the beach and pool because it was not a nice environment. We both were really disappointed with that ! The staff- As mentioned before the check in was easy and the individual that checked us in was friendly. The people that are working behind the hopitality/tourism booth need some serious training. We wanted to take the bus to Old San Juan- The bus is 75 cents compared to a 20.00 taxi ride one way. We asked the girl at the travel desk if their was a bus that we could catch to Old San Juan? She told us where the bus stop was and the bus number. Well it turned out she gave us the wrong bus number. After waiting at the bus stop for 45 min for a bus # that did not exhist we gave up and walked down to the Embassy Suites. I went to the travel desk and a very nice man at their travel desk told us the correct bus #, when the bus came, and an abundance of information I did not even ask for. Kudos to the Embassy employees! The bartenders at the Marriott are rude. We sat for minutes and minutes just to be waited on when their were only 2 others at the bar. After 2 drinks they just handed us our bill, they did not even ask if we wanted another drink, it was as if they were trying to get you to leave, so they could go back to doing nothing! That happened to us 2 days in a row. 2 drinks then your bill. Food- We did not eat at any of the Marriott restaurants. We went to the Embassy Suites and ate at the OutBack Steak house. We also went to a nice casual sports bar/grill- (I highly recommend) called Lupis. Very affordable beer/food. A full bottle of beer is 2.75 to 3.75 depending on what you drink. At the Marriott a small glass of draft house brand is $4.00 and a 10 oz can at the beach is 5.00. Rip Off!!!! If you are traveling to this area and you are on business or need a place to stay before a cruise, then I would say stay here. If you are a vacation traveler and this is your only destination....do not stay here! My husband and I ventured to other properties and the Intercontinental definitely has a tropical / resort atmosphere. The Embassy Suites is nice and the people working there are very friendly but this property has more of a business atmosphere.", "Date": "April 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood value but don't have too high expectations\u201d", "Author": "Dave7702", "ReviewID": "UR4740006", "Content": "My wife and I spent four days and three nights at this hotel (Mar 23-26, 2006). This hotel is good as long as you know what it does and does not offer. Probably the reason why it is slightly less expensive than the other hotels in the area. We kept on being told that the hotel was booked solid and as a result we had to wait for the 3:00PM check in time to get to our rooms. Hotel seemed a bit quiet though and that may be because by the end of march, it is nearing the end of the vacation season. The room itself was great. Big, with a couch, separate chair, normal hotel fridge, DVD player and balcony with plastic table and chairs. The room looked pretty new and the bathroom worked out well. The DVD player is free to use but if you don't bring your own, they advertise a DVD rental machine in the lobby. Also, we had an \"oceanview\" room, but it really was a side room with a balcony on an angle so you saw about half the water. We didn't care either way, but just wanted to make that clear. The one constant every review talks about is the noise. This hotel is VERY close to the airport and you WILL hear the jets as they take off either in your room or on the beach. By the weekend, though, there seemed to be less planes or maybe we just got used to it. The beach and pool were both great, and well cared for. No problems at all with getting towels, etc. The beach is technically public but no problems. Everyone was just having a great time. (The beach by the Ritz about 500 yards down the beach actually was mobbed and had a lot of seaweed.) The bar is good by the pool but the food options are limited and like every hotel in the caribbean, overpriced. We rarely ate at the hotel. The buffet always seemed expensive and nothing special. We did enjoy the ice cream/coffee bar they have open almost all day and night. The unique thing that this hotel has is an outside restaurant right by the beach. It is only open for dinner. We didn't get to try it and that is one regret. Picante's the main bar/dance floor is pretty quiet during the week, but come Friday and Saturday nights is packed! But not with people from the hotel, mainly local residents who salsa anywhere they find some floor. The bands were awesome and the energy that Puetro Rico is known for was definitely there. The place was still going strong well after 2am. Taxis to Old San Juan are $19 one way and this hotel is the farthest resort from Old San Juan (the positive is the beach is probably the best). There are few places to eat in the area. We ate at Lupi's. You can also try the Intercontinental or El San Juan Hotel, all about a 15 minute walk. In the end, have dinner in Old San Juan. (Marakias and the El Convento hotel are 2 suggestions). Overall a good time, but realize what you are getting. This is NOT an all-inclusive resort. It is relaxing during the day but not someplace to have that much fun at night. Better for maybe slightly older couples or people who just want to rest and relax on their vacation. P.S.

My friend's dad had Marriott points and she didnt have any problem using them. Being college students, it's not hard to impress us, so we loved our room and our balcony that over looked the ocean. Our room was very standard--2 queen beds, a tv (it did have a DVD player you could use for free, so bring DVDs!)and a TINY mini fridge that fit about 4 small water bottles. So it was really hard keeping perishables from the grocery store bc we needed food for the week since we had little moeny (I suggest you bring a collapsable cooler, I had one and it was awesome). Yes, the airport and hotel is literally separated by trees, so when the planes took off it was so loud you couldnt even hear someone talk to you. Didnt really bother us tho. THE GOOD: The beach was AMAZING. Gorgeous beach, gorgeous water, great pool, awesome hammocks. The pool guys and guys who bring out the chairs were all really nice and accomodating. We spent hours a day outside at the beach (wear LOTs of sunscreen---it gets HOT). The concierge was helpful with places to eat and things to do. We scheduled a trip to the rainforest through the hotel ($40 for a 1/2 day) and it was awesome. EAT AT METROPOL!!! Its right across from the Ritz Carlton, and has fantastic cuban-puerto rican food (plus, we could afford it). Hotel also has a really cool casino. Lost $10 there, tho :( THE BAD: I wouldnt eat at the hotel restuarant. They wanted $21.95 for the dinner buffet, which looked really crappy, and when me and my friends would go eat and split our meals amongst ourselves (bc we're poor) the waitresses were ----- and one time even \"accindentally\" charged us extra on our check. All in all, we only stayed here bc it was basically free for us. I wouldnt really recommend it for families if they had a choice, it was full of business people.

The only good thing at the buffet was the fried potatoes, but $12.95 for potatoes? The room: The advertised panoramic view is very deceiving. Two people cannot move about freely. We had to move the furniture in order to get to the sliding glass doors onto the roof top. Two glass doors are needed to mask the constant jet sounds from the airport runway which is about 300 yds. from the hotel. We paid extra for Oceanview. What view? You can see the ocean, but you have to look over the many noisy air-handlers on the hotel roof. We were on the 5th floor, which sat 2 floors above the roof. We're sure glad we paid extra for that oveanview. We sat on the patio the first morning,but couldn't have a conversation because of all the noise. When we asked Management the first three days of our stay for a room change they said there was nothing better. The room itself is in dire need of updating and repair ... although they advertise that it is \"newly renovated\". The bathroom floor tile was disgusting. We felt we had to lay towels down to walk. The shower rod was barely secured to the tile. The shower curtain didn't extend full length to catch the shower water.

I had read all the reviews of the property prior to booking it and was willing to take the chance regarding airplane noise. I had booked this hotel several months before our stay, 2 nights were to be on Marriott rewards points, and we were paying for 2 nights at a rate of $199USD for an ocean front room. Due to our flight being delayed out of Miami, I called the hotel to tell them we would not be arriving until after midnight...they assured me this would not be an issue since I had guaranteed my reservation with Visa and the fact I was a Marriott Elite Member. Much to our shock we arrived at the hotel shortly after midnight to find the hotel completely sold out - there were NO rooms available....not even the one's that were confirmed for us! Lucky for me, because of my Marriott Elite status, they paid for us to stay the night at the Intercontinental - including taxi fare there and back. The Manager at the Marriott was highly apologetic - we were furious. The next morning we arrived back at the Marriott to find that we had been upgraded to Ocean Front Suites! The Manager made sure to find us and invite our whole party to a complimentary dinner. The suites were wonderful - they were very large with spectacular ocean views. The suites were very clean and in excellent condition, there were no issues with our accommodations whatsoever. The property itself is indeed located very close to the airport although we heard NO airplane noise at night at all. True, you could hear the planes taking off during the day - but honestly, it was not offensive in the least. Do NOT let this detail deter you from booking this hotel, it truly is a non-issue. The beach is lovely, and the pool area very spacious and clean with a swim up bar. There were wait staff available at the pool area to take your order for drinks as well as a beachfront grill that served hamburgers, hot dogs, nachos etc. The restaurant food was very good - we ate there twice and enjoyed the buffet for dinner. Breakfast was also good and I found the price $12.95 to be very reasonable for the vast selection and custom omelettes.

I was a guest of the hotel for a week. I arrived late on a Sunday night and before I entered the hotel lobby, I could hear the salsa music. The hotel desk clerk, \"Helen\" was very nice and made me feel comfortable. Check-in was quick and easy. I then went to my room located on the eleventh floor and was very impressed when I entered the room. It was just like the pictures I had seen on the web concerning the hotel. After I had unpacked, I went back to the lobby to partake in the festivaties. The casino was small and most of the locals were playing the penny and nickel slots. The card games seemed to be quite busy as well. There was hardly anyone playing the quarter and dollar slots. So, during my stay I would drop maybe up to twenty dollars from time to time in the casino. I believed I broke even. Back to the Picante lobby bar, just as it has been previously written, on the weekends, its very crowded. The patrons are practically dancing everywhere, even the hallways of the lobby. I observed that the majority of the patrons were in their 30's although the would be a pack of twenty somethings. Unless you were sitting at a table it was hard to get a drink because the waitresses and bartenders are very busy doing their jobs. Also, you could hear the weekend music while riding the elevators even up to the eleventh floor! When I checked into the hotel I was given tickets to the breakfast buffet at the Salsa, which was a real value and I suggect to anyone to include this in their package. There was some complainants I heard such as the food was cold and they weren't given enough tickets for their package, I found the servers to be exceptionally pleasant and in fact, made my stay at the hotel. One morning it was very busy and I was waiting outside the buffet area for a table to be cleaned. One of the servers recognized me and immediately cleared a table for me. I did not eat at the dinner buffet which I thought like others that it was too expensive ($21.95). However, after eating or dining out in town, I spent at least the same amount of money so I would suggest to try the dinner buffet at least once, it includes everything. The Banana Ice and Sandwich Lobby Snack Shop seemed to be alittle expensive. The cheapest sandwich, ham and cheese, cost about $7.00. I did have a pistrami sandwich for about $10.00 and it was good. The kids seemed to like the idea that they could climb up on the bar stools and order a soda or ice cream :-) Now back to my room, yes you can hear the jets land and takeoff! The hotel is practically on the airfield. But I'm a former student pilot so this was a great motivator for me and I will be persuing the matter at a later time. Depending upon the size of the jet, the pictures on the wall would shake. I thought that this was funny just like watching movies where the hotel or motel in near the railroad tracks everything would shake. At night the noise did tape off so I would leave my balcony doors open to hear the ocean waves hit the beach. I had a very pleasant time at the hotel and stayed at the hotel the majority of the time. The hotel guest were a variety of people, families, honeymooners, businessmen, and those pre-cruisers. I don't have any complaints except, CHECK YOUR RECIEPT upon checking out. My stay was through my time-share which meant I had to pay for the government and resort fees. One guest of the hotel was not aware of these fees and was highly upset. The hotel desk clerk was very professional in explaining the taxes to the guest who threatened that no one from the stated would want to stay at the hotel. My lesson came after I got home and reviewed the bill. I learned that my room was charged the self-parking four times at $15.00 each ($60.00). I did not park any vehicle on hotel property and when I did rent a car, it was returned that night to the car rental agency. I blame myself for not checking the bill so please check all receipts. I think that this was an honest mistake but still I can't see how the hotel charged my room and not check with the occupant of the room if someone had given my room number.

We stayed for four nights and five days. Our overall experience at the hotel was very good. I really only have two complaints about the hotel. The first day we arrived at the hotel, the pool area was swarmed by locals. This was a Monday, I believe it was some sort of holiday. All the pools were so packed there was no room for anybody elsa to get in. Although, that really was not a problem for us because we just walked down to the ocean. There was hardly anybody at the beach. It just made us feel a little uncomfortable. This problem only occured the first day, the rest of the time was great. The second complaint I had about the hotel is I believe the cleaning lady stole some of my colonga. I usually keep a bottle in my travel bag just for traveling. I don't use it that much, so I know it was just about full. I came back one day and the bottle was empty. If that is the only thing she stole from me, I am happy. Overall the hotel was great. The staff was very helpful and accessable. I really got the feeling the hotel was trying do everything they could to make every guess have an enjoyable experience. I really liked seeing the management of the hotel in the presents of the guesses overseeing the operations of the hotel. The rooms were pretty nice. They have just been recently updated. They had a very modern feel. The oceanveiw rooms are nice. They have a balconie with two chairs and a table. Our view was a partial view of the beach and more of a view of the apartment building next door. My advice is to make sure you get an even numbered room. The even numbered rooms get a full view of the pool and beach. The property ammenities were very nice. The lobby featured a bar, ice cream parolor, restaurant, and casino. The bar was very nice and seemed to be very crowded everynight. The ice cream parolor was very good. They offered sandwiches and ice cream desserts. The casino was pretty cool. They had a ton of slot machines and the regular tables for roullette, black jack and poker. I think the selling point of the hotel is the pool area. The landscaping features a ton of palm trees around the pool with other tropical plants. The pool also has a swim up bar that is a lot of fun to sit there and drink pina colodas and listen to Bob Marley. I really enjoyed the fact that you could just walk straight out from the pool and jump into the ocean. I have read other reviews about the airplanes taking off. They are right the planes are loud. The hotel is litterly right across the street from the main runway. It really did not bother my wife and I. Every once in a while you can here them in your room. The concierge was very helpful. We ventured off from the hotel on two day trips. The first was to Old San Juan. It is a $16 cab ride. The concierge hooked us up with a map and circled places to see. We went to the forts and shopped the historic streets of Old San Juan. The other day trip we went on was a snorkling adventure. Although we did not book that through the concierge because it was already full. I believe this was due to poor weather the day before. We went through a company called EastWind. It was a great trip. We went to the island of Calabere. A minimal populated island off the east coast of Puerto Rico. It had beautiful coral reefs and beachs. Some of the best in the world. Overall it was a great vacation. The Courtyard Marriott rooms were considerably cheaper than most of the hotels in the Isla Verde area. They offered just about the same ammenities that the high dollar hotels do. I was very satisfied with my stay and would recommend it to somebody elsa.

The maid service was great, however. They left any personal belongings in their place, folded clothing they found on the beds, and straightened toiletries on the counter in the bathroom. Very unexpected, but appreciated. The location throws you a little. You will need to walk quite a bit to get to the local restaurants or the grocery store (the fresh food market carries great prices on rum, by the way), and what they consider \"next door\" (such as the Ritz Carlton) are still at least a 10 minute walk. If you don't mind being on your feet, this is ok. We still would have appreciated better prices within the hotel. The pool was also a disappointment. The main pool does not seem to circulate well, and carries a host of bugs and critters floating on the top. We spent any time in the pool in the \"kiddie pool\" since it was better circulated.

They do take the chairs back at 5:00. There are only 4 umbrellas available. On Mon-Thu they charge $6/chair and $9/umbrellas, free on the weekends - but the weekends are really busy.

I'd give this hotel an 8 and mostly because of the pool and lobby area. I will say the pool is very very nice. Large, lot's of chairs, clean refreshing water. If you don't require lots of assistance this place is great. I felt that the staff was a little slow. Mostly when it came to food service.Sometimes they didn't even acknowledge your standing there waiting. Since I didn't really care much about that I was fine with it. My son loved the pool with the little slide. Also loved the beach. The lobby was so nice. Big and clean. There was a nice band playing at night with a nice bar area with small tables. It did not feel crowded at all and the hotel was at capacity when I was there due to Feb vacation. I didn't think I was going to be happy with the beach because my view of it which was ocean front was an area of the beach that was quite murky with black ocean matter at the shore. However, the beach area that is directly in front of the pool and used by hotel guests was clean and not murky at all. I suppose my view was of an area that was inbetween hotels. The water was a little rough but not so much so that my son couldn't place at the shore and get in a little bit. The sun certainly helps the beach. When it is out the water is a pretty green color. It doesn't look as pretty when the clouds are out which they were for two days. The salsa restaurant that had the buffet for breakfast and dinner was nice. I like the selections of food for dinner. It was all fresh and very good. Children under 12 ate free with a paying adult which was great.They also had a ala carte menu that was fine for dinner. Nothing elaborate but okay. Breakfast was just ordinary but fine. Even an omelette area. It was free with my room so definetly make sure that is included in the price. We did get take out from this restaurant to bring up to the room one night and the chicken was raw. GROSS That was not so nice. They were not very apologetic about it so that kind of turned me off. The rooms are just okay. I would say over all that was the biggest downfall of the hotel. We had deluxe ocean view and deluxe ocean front which was a jr suite. I needed more space so paid 290 for the jr suite which was just a regular room with a little more sq footage and a microwave and mini sink. I like to have a nice room and this was not so nice. It was clean though. Towels were fluffy. Bed was just okay and nothing else. They did have complimentary internet access that was good. There are major taxes added to the rooms. Resort tax and PR tax etc. It added up to about 45 dollars on top of your rate so consider this when booking. We gambled in the casino one night and it was fun. There was a five dollar blackjack table on a Saturday night tha I stayed at for 4 hours. The dealers and host were very friendly. The area around the hotel up and down the street is okay. NOt so great walking at night but stay in groups and you will be fine. I heard the planes in the day but not at night.

I felt ridiculous when I saw these 2 hotels..this hotel was great for after the cruise because we just wanted to relax and did not want to sight see. The hotel was clean, we had plenty of towels and all those little products you usually see. The service was very good and I thought the hotel staff really went above and beyond to try to please us. We got off our cruise ship about 9:30 in the morning and our check in time was not until 4pm. I had called this hotel before leaving home to see if they would store our bags until check in and they said yes that we could store them and then enjoy their facilities. Not only did they do that but they also let us check in before noon, as soon as a room was available. They have numerous bathrooms near the pool area where you can change into your bathing suits or if you just want to lounge around the pool in your street clothes you can do that also. They also have numerous tables and chairs near the lobby where you can just relax and have a cool drink while you wait if you want to do that in air conditioned comfort. If you arrive during the evening they had a great latin band playing and they had a very nice dance area also. We asked for an ocean view room and we did have one but as noted in one review if you looked down you could see a garbage dumpster at street level but all you had to do was look out and you had a great partial view of the beach that was just beautiful..given a choice where would you look?? It was great watching the surfers on the waves..I've never seen surfers in person before. They were probably about 1 mile or so from the beach area by the Marriott so did not interfere with being in the surf at this hotel. If you want a full view of the beach you need to ask for a beach front suite. We were happy with our room. It had a great little balcony. There was a building next to it undergoing a little renovation but it did not affect our stay there at all and the Ritz is just down the street a block or so, so it's a nice area. The Marriott is gated and the staff also put lounges and umbrellas on the beach are for your convenience. (All the beaches in San Juan are public beaches). You do hear the planes flying overhead during the day since you are so close to the airport but I did not hear any at night..also if you're on the beach the sound of the surf drowns out he noise from the planes. Their pool area is just beautiful. They have regular pools, kiddie pools, a nice hot tub and numerous loungers so there was never problem finding a place to relax. It is also open 24/7. They have a swim up bar that is open from about 11am until sometime in the evening. We did not buy a lot of drinks there since they were $7.00 each and we have gotten some alcohol on the cruise to take off with us anyway. You can get an all you can drink all day soda deal for 3.95 which I thought was good. FYI..the American hamburgers served at the swim up pool area are 9.95 each. The have a casino downstairs which we tried briefly. They have a gift shop with limited selections but you could get a really cold can of soda for $1.00. They have an area where they sell rather expensive ice cream concoctions but you could also get a hot dog for $2.95. If you wanted a drink and chips with it the price was 4.95. Needless to say after the cruise we did not have a lot of money left so we got the hot dog combo before leaving for the flight home. They also have a restaurant called Salsa where they serve breakfast and dinner buffets during the week and also a lunch buffet on the weekends. We did not try it since we went into Old San Juan to eat at Mofongo's but we did inquire as to the price which was about $10 each for breakfast and lunch. We did take the bus into Old San Juan because we just fell in love with that area when we arrived in Puerto Rico. The buses are supposed to run every 20 minutes but believe me that is a suggestion not a schedule. We waited about 45 minutes for a bus but the concierge had warned us the buses did not run as often on Sunday. But then again for 0.25 cents you can't expect perfection...There were some areas between Isla Verde and Old San Juan in Condado that were really run down and I would not have felt safe walking thru them even during the day. I'm glad we stayed in Old San Juan and Isla Verde during our stay and not in the Condado area. We found a great restaurant in front of the Sheraton Old San Juan called Mofongo's..Our waiter was Omar and he was just great...The food was really good and the prices were reasonable. Try the Mojitos, they are really good for a cool refreshing drink. I will also write a review of the Sheraton and more suggestions for that area. If you want to get from the Marriott to Old San Juan per bus you need to take the A5 bus. When we were done we did take a taxi back to the Marriott which cost $15.00 and was much faster. The pool area at the Marriott and the beach beyond that were so great we just wanted to get back there and relax. Some of the taxi drivers speak fluent English and some speak no English at all so you may want the valet in front of the hotel to tell the taxi driver where you want to go just in case if you don't speak Spanish. All in all this is a great place to stay if you want to swim, sun and play in the surf..

Although it was completely clean it did have a slight odor but nothing terrible. This hotel IS very close to the airport, and yes you will hear aircraft taking off and landing during the day. Not a big deal for us, and most importantly we slept great at night and if there was any air traffic during the wee hours, we didn't notice it. Watching the planes lifting off the ground as we sat on the beach was actually kind of entertaining. This beach is not for snorkeling, water is too churned-up. I enjoyed being in it, however: jumping over each big wave as it came crashing in...fun! The pool was very pretty, they landscaped around it more so than other pools we've been to, it added a nice touch of tropical greenery. (Look for the native bird of Puerto Rico flitting around the palm trees while you're there). The Marriott's buffet was (not surprisingly) nothing great. We ate there one night because it was easy and then found restaurants in San Juan the other 2 nights. The American breakfast was adequate but again, you won't love it. Staff were all pleasant & competent. We didn't venture into the casino at all. All in all, there are definitely fancier places to stay in San Juan.

We got stuck on a smoking floor, which they did not tell us about, and every morning, we woke up coughing. As soon as we left the hotel, we felt better. We also got a room with the connecting door--we could hear the family of four (with a baby & a toddler) talking, using the toilet, the baby's cries as if they were in the room with us. I wonder if they knew that they were on a smoking floor? As for the room, everything looked clean, at first. Then I noticed that the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty and loose, there was a fine settling of dust everywhere, and the maid got progressively sloppy with the cleaning of the room, making the bed, replacing towels, etc. When we called down to the front desk to make several complaints, they were not very helpful. At one point, one of them actually said that their hotel isn't exactly the most expensive hotel in the area and implied that if we wanted all these things we were asking for, that we should have stayed at the Ritz. The casino is cheesy, but if you just like to gamble for fun, then there are plenty of $.05 slot machines, unlike other casinos, and you don't have to wait for a seat at a low-minimum table. The breakfast buffet was awful--completely over priced and what they were touting as made to order breakfast was just an omelet station, which was almost always closed (and we were there one hour before they stopped serving). The only time in the week that I saw it open was when we got there very early (we had vouchers, so it was a cheap way to have some simple b'fst).

This is obviously the slow season, because the resort was not crowded. I can say that I really enjoyed myself, and I was treated quite well by the staff. I had to pay for my breakfast buffet ($10.00), but it was well worth it. My room was on the 8th floor, a non-smoking floor, and it included a mini-fridge, dvd and cd player. It was very nice. I have read complaints about the noise from the airport, but, at night time, you do not hear the noise. As a matter of fact, I only heard the planes about three times from my room, and it was in the daytime. If you are going to visit Old San Juan, wear loose clothing and your walking shoes. If possible, bring an umbrella to sheild yourself from the heat. I caught a bus about three blocks from the Marriott to get to Old San Juan, the fare was only 25 cents. Old San Juan is beautiful and historic. I enjoyed the street vendors because they did not try to hustle me. I purchased many bottles of water for $1.00 because of the heat. I drank the bottled water because I do not like the taste of the tap water in San Juan. If you ride the bus to Old San Juan, and intend to walk to places like the museums and forts, be advised that it is all uphill, and very strenuous. The people are very friendly as well as beautiful. There are many eating places in Old San Juan, and I regret that I did not get the name of the one where I ate. The food was good and the prices were decent. But back to the Marriott Isla Verde. The \"Bananas\" restaurant in the lobby serves pretty good food, such as soup, sandwiches, and ice cream. The grill around the pool also serves decent food, but the prices are not great (five dollars for a cup of beer). The evening buffet in the lobby restaurant is adequate, but you should also try some of the other hotels or restaurant for your evening meals. While lounging on the beach Sunday, I was suprised to learn that I could order food from the outdoor grill,and a staff member would bring it to me. Check your bill before you leave! Someone charged two cocktails to my room. I contested it and insisted on seeing the bill with my signature. The bill was brought to me, and when the signatures were checked, it was obvious that it was not my signature, It was promptly handled by the staff. My only problem was my nextel world-wide phone does not work in San Juan. When I called them to find out why, I was told that nextel does not have service in San Juan. The world-wide nextel is a joke. But I digress!

I booked a fall special rate direct with marriott at $129/night. This was a very good rate in comparison to other hotels in San Juan. The hotel was remodeled/reopened sometime after the year 2000, but I am not sure of the year. I believe this property used to be a Crowne Plaza, as that is how it is labeled on an old map I found online of San Juan and the Isla Verde area. The hotel itself is very nice and very clean. Everyone on staff were very friendly and made our stay pleasant. It is fairly compact and not a sprawling resort, so it is easy to get around. The lobby basically contains three open restaurants (somewhat interesting to see where one starts and another stops.) The options are good for kids and adults, and the breakfast buffet is very good. We loved sitting beachside to eat. There is also a nice casino ... I think I played $2 and won a nickle. Not big gamblers. There is a small gift shop and a DVD rental machine, but we had heard they skip some, and we had our own. The DVD/VCR in the room was a nice touch and we enjoyed watching our movies when it was raining or in the evenings. The pools are nice and the service good. There is one freeform pool, a hot tub (which is tucked away in one of the curves of the freeform pool.) There is a smaller kids pool with seats like a hot tub and a very short waterslide (about three feet tall), then a very shallow pool that looks like a hot tub but does not have heat or bubbles. The chairs poolside are nice with a canvas covering, and towels are provided poolside. There is an exercise facility, but we did not go in it. Our room was a king bed with a couch. Room 522. It is the last room going toward the ocean (away from the street) before the four real oceanfront rooms start on the end of the hotel. If you can get a room with an even number, you'll have a BEAUTIFUL view of Carolina beach. If you can get a room ending in 22 on any of the floors (the higher the better), there is one less wall obscuring the view. The rooms with an odd number through 21 appear to face a condo complex, so the view is not as open. There are no buildings to the east of the Courtyard as it is basically at the end of the strip. But it's VERY convenient to the airport. And yes, you can hear and see jets taking off, but it didn't really bother us. We never smelled jet fuel. I found it fascinating to see the large planes rise up over the trees, right across the four lane that the Courtyard fronts. Our room also had free high-speed Internet access and Wi-Fi access in various places on the property, but I had promised myself that the laptop was not traveling on this trip. I understand the business center also offers Internet access, but we never sought it out. The beach is very deep and clean ... they smoothed it out every evening or early morning. It is the same beachfront that the Ritz Carlton has about four or five buildings west of the Courtyard. To the east, it is open beach with public facilities and lifeguard stands. The entire time we were there, the beach was practically deserted. The food in the restaurants was good, but a bit pricey, even for the sandwiches, etc. We bought two drinks poolside and they were $6 each, but really watered down and not very good. We walked down the sidewalk west of the hotel, past Pine Grove and the Ritz Carlton, and had lunch at Shots sports bar and grill, which was good. There is also a Denny's, and there is a full service drugstore where we bought Cokes and snacks. We took a taxi to Plaza las Americas, the largest mall in the Caribbean, and it was very nice (and very loud ... we think some politicians were passing through with mariachi bands!) There is an Outback Steakhouse at the Embassy Suites a short cab ride away, and Ruth's Chris is at the Intercontinental (I think that's right), also a cab ride. Above all, it was a very nice and relaxing stay, which is what we were looking for. We would definitely choose to stay there again, even despite the noise from the airport. We would probably opt to eat out more and less at the hotel. But for the money, the lodging was well worth it. One note regarding the airport ... either we missed signage or there is no signage, but be sure to have your luggage run through the USDA checkpoint BEFORE you check it at your ticket counter for your flight. We had to double-back to have them run through, and had it not been for the fact that we just missed the rush, we could have missed our flight.", "Date": "October 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cNo Room Service?

If you come to the area, definitely visit the town of Pinones, rent a bike and ride down the coastline, visit the Rainforest, tour El Morro (the fort in Old Ponce), check out a Cockfight at Gallistica, definitely do the Bacardi Distillery Tour, and eat at Ajili Mojili (go on a Sunday to eat the buffet so you can sample everything), Metropol (the cornish hen and the Mojito drink are amazing), Lupis (perfect margaritas and the fish tacos rock), and Mi Casa (can't lose no matter what you order)... By the way, the breakfast at the Marriott rocks! Make sure you hang out at the Wyndham El San Juan on Saturday night (about 6 blocks away). There is a huge party every saturday night there. Also, have a drink at the Wet Bar at the Water Club Hotel (approximately 8 blocks away) because the Wet Bar sits on top of the hotel and is very cosmopolitan and posh. Also, make sure you take the local bus (A5) to Old San Juan. It costs 25 cents versus a $16 cab ride one way. Also, you can take the Ferry to Catano, which is where the Bacardi Distillery is located. The ferry will cost 50 cents each way. Remember, you will have to take a cab from the ferry drop off, which will cost $2 per person. DO NOT sign up for a tour through the hotel to Bacardi. It will cost two peoplel $80 when you can do it via bus and ferry and taxi for less than $20 total... Enjoy Puerto Rico and the Marriott. You can't beat it! I don't work for Marriott and I don't have any family or friends that work for Marriott.

I found trying to get food was difficult whilst in the hotel so I spent my time their hungry but if you want to lose a few pounds this might be the place. When I booked I was quoted US$160 a night but when I left they add a 10%($16.00) Hotel Tariff and the government taxes of $19.36 so the total is $195.36. I queried the hotel tariff and taxes and could not get a sensible answer from the staff. My understanding from staying at other hotels in San Juan is the hotel tax is 9% so where they came up which the hotel tariff of 10% and the other of 11% I still don't know.

We arrived on Tuesday, May 25, 2004 in the mid afternoon. We registered, I asked what type of room I had gotten (got reservations through Expedia), the host stated that I was in a standard room. I then gave him my Marriott Rewards card, he said that he could give me a much better room, and proceeded to look. We went from a 3rd floor no view room to a 12th floor beach view room! The room was very good, excellent view, on the beach side looking over the pool. The room had internet connection and a king bed with a pullout sofa. Customer service was excellent, they knew my name at the desk, without even looking me up! Pool was excellent, love the swim up to the bar, ate a lunch there and drank SEVERAL Pina Coladas! Beach access was excellent, even though it was the NEXT beach over from the big beach. There are NO other hotels to look at down the beach, as the rest of the beach is a public beach! It was very quite and restful, beach was clean, pool was nicely set-up! Seeing as we where there on the leading edge of memorial day weekend, LOTS of 20 something girls (pretty too) where in the pool and on the beach most of the time! ONLY Markdowns: 1. free breakfast, GREAT idea, Poor quality food (only the eggs, VERY DRY), rest was very good, lots of juice, and PR coffee; warm milk, strong coffee! 2. Buffet Dinner, pass if possible, marginal quality. (Went to Lupi's for dinner twice, a short walk toward InterCont). 3. Paying for parking, was a $10.00/day charge? Guests should be free!? 4. Concierge, was no help, just should pictures in a book, some knowledge, not going \"Above and Beyond\". Thought it was okay to go to El Yungue on the Friday before Memorial Day, we tried..traffic and crowds where terrible! TIP: Reserve a Snorkel trip out of Fojardo before you go, we used Spread Eagle II, excellent trip, do it on week days ONLY!

However, things did calm down a bit on the weekdays. Because our flight wasn't until 5 p.m. on the day of our departure, they stored our luggage for us and allowed us to continue to use the facilities.

My partner and I vacationed there the first week of March after doing research on the internet including Trip Advisor. Yes, the hotel is very close to the airport. The runway is just over the highway directly next to the hotel. The jets can definitely be heard. However, just about any hotel in Isla Verde will be within range of the noise of the jets. Also keep in mind that the Isla Verde area while offering great beaches is about a 20 minute taxi ride into Old San Juan. About $20 each way including tip. Sunday evening seemed to be the worse day for take offs, after that they were less frequent. If you close your balcony doors, the sound is muffled. Bottom line is that we had a very nice time despite the jets. The pool area is great with friendly waiters at the swim up bar and grill. The beach was fantastic, clean with a fantastic view. Plus it was not crowded at all. The beach is right off the pool area, so you really don't need to pay for a beach lounge chair, just stay at the pool and stroll to the beach. While you can save a lot on dinner costs by utilizing the Courtyard's dinner buffet for just $20 per person, you are in walking distance to the Ritz-Carlton and Wyndham El San Juan which offer a wide array of restaurants. The complimentary breakfast was also excellent and a great way to keep your food costs down. The place offers a great stay for the price.
