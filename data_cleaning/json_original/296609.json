I was looking for hotels south of Damrak but, as seems to be the way in Amsterdam, prices are so high for average hotels. (Basically you will know that if you have been to Amsterdam before as i have that the hotels are not the best & in comparison make The Premier Inn look like the Hilton).. Was a bit worried as did not want to be in middle of RLD but was pleasantly surprised by the staff, hotel & room.. Location - on one of the canals in the RLD - opposite the Cassa Rosso Sex Theatre.. but if you get a room at the rear of the hotel its nice & quiet.. good location to see the sights - 5 mins to dam sqaure or Centraal station , 15 to rembrantplein & 30 to leidseplein & vondlepark areas.. Room - was given room on top / 3rd floor (room 37) which had twin beds, en suite shower, air con, TV would have been nice but not a big deal - it opened with a key card. The hotel had a 24 hour bar downstairs which closed its doors to non-residents at 01.00am which was excellent & made it feel a whole lot safer. The stairs are very steep to the top floors but got used to it. carpets a bit grubby & threadbare & could do with changing. Bed OK for comfort. Breakfast - Very Good buffet served till 9.00am only!! - Hot breakfast self service & also cold ham, bread cheese, jams etc, coffee, juice. Sets you up for the day.. Fantastic!! Staff - very pleasant & helpfull with any travel tips etc... All in all - decent budget hotel for a 1 or 2 night stay if you grab a good deal.. would consider staying again for a quick break..", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cideal hotel if you're not picky!\u201d", "Author": "neeeshxox", "ReviewID": "UR119058018", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel basically because it was a great price. The location was convenient and the rooms were very clean. The washrooms were a little bit uncomfortable (shared per floor, toilet/shower combined). The staircase was EXTREMELY narrow which can be bad if you're claustrophobic, or, if you plan to return to your hotel intoxicated with everything fun amsterdam has to offer. With that being said, I was still able to make it up the stairs so it is possible! Management is extremely nice. Breakfast was included really quite good - also a great selection of coffee/cappuccino/lattes included which was nice! And also important - no early check in but we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel bar and nothing was stolen - something which many guests at the hotel did!

The bar doubles up as reception and its open 24 hours. Its really a good bar with a cracking computerised jukebox of about 1,000,000 songs on it , so something for everyone.

They have a large screen showing all the footy and the bar is smoke friendly which is a bonus.
