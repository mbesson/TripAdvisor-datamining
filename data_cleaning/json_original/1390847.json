The receptionist stopped me on my way to my room and stated that they received complaints from other guests saying we were to loud. I know this was false because we hadn't been in our room ALL day! They wanted pick on us because we didn't 'look' like we belong. While checking out, the receptionist charged my card wrong and it took them a whole week to correct it.

Upon entering the hotel there was noone to greet us so we walked straight up to the counter where the attendant never even bothered to look up and greet us. I said Hi and at the same time the phone rang and she said excuse me and took the call. I work in customer service and I know this is a major NO-NO. Anyway we were given our room keys and headed up to our room in an elevator that sounded like it veryyy old when compared to the rest of the hotel. The room itself was very cosy but rather small. It was suitable for my husband and I but I can see that some people would say it was too small. The car park had ample spaces and the hotel itself is located in an isolated area. I saw a subway about 5 mins walk away but most other eating places were at least 5-10 minutes away. One night when we got back there was a stench that made you run into the hotel as fast as you can as it was so putrid. We had a breakfast inclusive rate and had breakfast for all three days - this is the reason why I said something major happened for me to not want to go back. Every morning that we went there were dirty tables. The menu ranges with not much options for vegetarians so one day we ordered the BLT egg sandwich without the bacon and halfway through it we found pieces of bacon - needless to say my husband ran to the bathroom to vomit as this goes against our religion. For this reason we will not go back as we were not even apologised to, instead we were asked if we wanted another one made. Also if you are going ask for a room away from the road as you can hear traffic passing and we were on the 5th floor. Pool and Gym was also small but available. The hotel itself was okay but I had a bad experience and this is why I am saying I will not go back.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guatemala", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice if you are traveling on a budget\u201d", "Author": "EdgarSGuatemala", "ReviewID": "UR124225606", "Content": "Talking about value for your money!

There was no closet, but there was an integrated work desk/TV stand/armoire. The armoire was rather small and I had difficulty hanging all of the clothes I brought that had fit into carryon luggage. The work desk was right in front of the HVAC unit and could get drafty. The TV was a flat-screen, but the only HD channels were for the local channels. The other cable channels (including HBO) were in standard-def. The free wired internet (wireless is also available) ranged from adequate-for-email (I measured 0.6 mbs) to unusable on a couple of the evenings I was there. There is an on-site restaurant (\"Bistro\") which offers breakfast in the mornings and some light fare along with beer and wine in the evenings. Service was really spotty and the staff tended go get flustered very easily. This was unfortunate because there is not much other dining nearby and what's there is scattered about and hard to find.

I arrived late in the evening of January 9th, 2011. I was greeted by a very nice evening manager who assisted me with check in. I am a Silver Elite member of the Marriott Rewards Program. But I was not welcomed back, I was not issued key cards that recognized me for being an Elite member and when I asked to have a room on the 5th floor I was told they were :\"very full tonight\" and basically. Gave me whatever she wanted. Despite the customer service failures, this hotel does deliver on comfort, cleanliness and style. The rooms here are nicer then at many of the older full service Marriotts and the bathrooms have a certain luxury feel to them. The lobby is the new signature Courtyard lobby and in this particular rendition of it. Has been executed to perfection. Giving the feel that you are at a much more expensive hotel. I did use the fitness center and it was clean and well equipped. I did not use the pool or hot tub. But they seemed very nice and they had plenty of fresh towels available. It is important to note that this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. In a corporate park of the Florida Turnpike. There is NOTHING to eat, do, or shop within at least a 5 minutes driving distance. And I am being generous !!! Furthermore, the hotel cafe closes at 10PM. They do have a market where you can get snacks. But the market was poorly stocked when I was there and 1/2 of the items that should of been there were not. So I did not have much of a selection. It was pretty bad. They had some TV dinners, but one of them was open and sitting in the refrigerator and the whole display just did not look clean. I did not want to drive in Miami at 2AM so I did what I could with the selections that were available. My room was next to a screaming baby and a family with kids that would not stop crying all night. When I called downstairs to resolve. I was told there was nothing they could do for me because the property was full. Breakfast was ok I guess. This is the new Courtyard bistro style breakfast. So there is no longer a buffet. I felt like I was at a factory. The service was very impersonal. You basically choose and pay for your item at the bar. Then they give you a number and within minutes the item arrives at your table. Presentation was not that great and the potatoes were super greasy. The only orange juice option that they offer is the cheap minute maid variety and it was not cold ??? So i had to request a glass of ice. At the end of the day my egg's, toast and coffee were $13.00 and for the price I think the Courtyard failed to deliver. The next day I called to see if I could extend my check out for 1 hour. As this is never been a problem before when I have asked in the past. Usually for Elite members they always grant you that courtesy. Not here !!! I had to speak to the GM (Laura Fernandez) to finally get them to give me the extra hour that I needed. She acted is is she was doing me a huge favor and seemed annoyed that I was asking. \"We have a big group coming in\" she said. Unless you are visiting one of the big corporations that are in the corporate park or in the area. I would not stay here. There are plenty of other options in the Doral area or Airport area that are closer to food, shopping and things to do. It is also important to know that the entrance to the FLA Turnpike which is adjacent to the hotel. Is a sunpass lane only. So, if you are a tourist and don't have electronic toll capability.

Well, if we wanted a shuttle we would have asked for one, or at least expected a price break since there were multiple passengers. The shuttle arrived, but there wasn't enough room since the other family had 10+ pieces of luggage. The front desk worker than ordered is a taxi 10 or so minutes after we requested to have one. Thankfully traffic and security at the airport wasn't bad and we made it in time. The only nice thing I can say is the room was comfortable and clean. Pool and whirlpool was small but okay.

She didn't speak a lick of english and we don't speak any Spanish so she had to call down to the front desk to have the front desk girl tell us that the housekeeper would like us to wait outside for five minutes while she finished. I said I had the \"DND\" on the door when we left and she apologized for the mix-up. I have no problem with her being in there.

The hotel is brand new with a really nice lobby and very modern. The rooms are very nicely decorated with a flat panel TV and a nice decor.
