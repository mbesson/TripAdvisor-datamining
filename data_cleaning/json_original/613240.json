{"Reviews": [{"Content": "You get what you pay for What do you expect, to pay bottom buck prices and get the Ritz? Get a life! This hotel shares the same area in Frankfurt as all the 4/5* hotels.Used this hotel during a Messe exhibition so we weren't ripped off by the major chains. Service on reception was couteous and polite, informative and friendly, what more do you need. 4 of us lads shared a room, enough for a shower and bed, what else do you need? Location top class, opposite train station and on all tram routes, walk into town in 15 minutes. Local bar excellent, Irish pub across road with warm atmosphere and good company. Messe is 25 minute pleasant walk or a short tram ride. Local restaurants excellent. Room was adequate but I wouldn't take your wife there, not enough mirrors..... Local hospitality excellent too ;-)", "Date": "May 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR370144346", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Fingers_Pete"}, {"Content": "cheap and chearfull Five of us (toon fans) stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in Newcastle United's midweek game against Eintracht Frankfurt. Arriving at the Hauptbahnhof railway station you leave by the main entrance and across the main road is the all to familiar Irish bar and then across the side street is hotel union which apart from that bar and several others close by not a bad location!! The hotel was cheap and chearfull and did what five lads required. We were on the sixth floor which is accesed by a slow lift which would only carry four of the slimmer lads on this trip! Whilst we only washed and slept in the hotel which was not very much due to the 24Hr bar close by it did the job as we did in the Commerzbank Arena to finish top of our group and continue to the next stage in the competition!", "Date": "Dec 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR575929652", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "geordiemag"}, {"Content": "Only if you are desperate! Stayed one night during june 2006 when world cup was on. (twin room) No hotels available. was charged \u9227?60 for the privelage which included breakfast. Room was the worst I have ever stayed in, small and the narrowest I have ever seen. Had room at back totally overshadowed by large derelict building. One large window which could only be opened fully inwards halfway over the bed so you had to run the gauntlet of getting clattered if you sat up without thinking. I believe their normal rate is \u9227?0 which is plenty.Only plus was it is a central location, close to main station.(5 mins walk) Also have to say staff were nice but thank god it was only for the one night!", "Date": "Jul 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR688919839", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ram83"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d613240-r7587918-Hotel_Union-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "613240", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
