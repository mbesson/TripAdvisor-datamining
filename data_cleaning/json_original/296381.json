It is just down a little hill from the Sultanahmet district, the most important district of Istanbul as far as the main tourist attractions are concerned. It is necessary to walk up a slight incline for about 50 yards to get to the main square, so this hotel might not be ideal for disabled or elderly persons. But once you're up the hill, everything is spread out before you. The most famous Mosques and architectural sites, the great little Turkish cafeterias for a cheap and delicious meal, other great restaurants and cafes. Once you're at the main square of Sultanahmet, it's only about a 10 minute walk, leisurely and very interesting, to the Grand Bazaar. The Hotel Erguvan has great service. The people at the desk were always very friendly and happy to answer any questions and give advice. The breakfast was lavish and served on the rooftop of the hotel, which has a fabulous view of the harbor. Getting to the Erguvan hotel, from the main railway station or the airport, and through no fault of the hotel, can be a problem. Getting anyplace, for a stranger unfamiliar with public transportation, can be a problem because of the predatory taxi drivers. Almost all refuse to use the meter and instead offer a \"special rate\", which turns out to be an exorbitant amount for the distance traveled. Insist that your cab engage the meter. I turned away at least 3 cabs, and their \"special rates\", before I found one which would actually use the meter.

We travelled scheduled with Turkish Airlines from Manchester - would recommend them. First time I remember actually enjoying an in flight meal for ages, and the seats were comfy too. Anyway, the hotel. I booked it direct having checked it out on TA. The booking was easy to do, the hotel responding promptly to my emails. As we stayed 3 nights we had complementary airport transfers and were also given a discount on the room charges for payment in cash - euros. Istanbul airport is large and very busy and we did wait a while for our lift to leave but we were promptly met and duly delivered to the hotel. As we arrived,early evening, a local street market was on going by the hotel which added to the whole scene. The hotel is in the older, Sutanhamet, area, and it really felt that I had arrived somewhere different. Check - in was swift and friendly, and we then adjourned to the roof terrace, off the breakfast room, as the sun set, to enjoy a nice chilled glass of wine.( Do check at restaurants, before you sit down, as to whether or not they serve alcohol. This is a Muslim country remember, and certainly those within the shadow of the main mosques may well not serve it). The sunset over the Bosphorus was superb, as was the view of the Blue Mosque from the side terrace. We retired there each day for sundowners - lovely. While mentioning the breakfast room, I would say that breakfast itself is adaquate, but they could complement it with some more fresh fruit perhaps. It's basically a savoury run and a sweet run with cakes,breads, and jams etc. There's tea and coffee and fruit juice. The rooms are a very good standard. Not large but a good size, very nicely furnished, and comfortable. There's also a lift to the upper floors.The morning call to prayers can be a bit noisy, but you can just turn over! The hotel is excellently placed for the main visitor attractions. All within very easy walking distance. We had a guide for a day - which the hotel will organise for you. It was a busy and informative day, and our guide got us into places quickly, using the locals' entrances.Brain was reeling a bit at the end of the day, but would recommend it, and it does give you a much better feel of where you are and it's history. It cost the four of us 100euros. Thought that the smaller Spice Bazar was better than the Grand Bazar, and the trip along the Bosphorus gave a very good feel of the sheer size, and variety of lifestyles going on in this city. It is ancient and modern, as well as east meets west. The Cisterns are worth a visit too, but at the end of the day this is all personal choice. Also, head towards the Blue Mosque and just wander around the local area at your own pace. We did and found a lovely little local bazar at the top of the road, and a lovely little area of nice cafes etc and hotels a bit further on. You can also walk down to the river through this area. The hotel are helpful for this and have maps they can give you. We left Istanbul after 3 days, (our return airport transfer was right on time and although it was 5am, we were waved off by our friendly receptionist), and flew on to Ercan in Northern Cyprus for a further 4 days at the Bellapais Gardens hotel in Bellapais village. We have been there before. It's so good I hesitate to tell you about it. Will be reviewing that again. Again, flew there with Turkish Airlines, (about a 1 hour flight). We were at the pool by 10.30am!! All in all would not hesitate to recommend the Erguvan to you. would give it 4.5 if could.

I was so distraught at the appearance of this room that I was supposed to stay in for one night, that I took my luggage that I hadn't unpacked and checked into another hotel at about 6:00 p.m. for one night! It was my vacation and the small room was horrible. I checked into the Amira (around the corner) for one night, which was 20 euros more but was outstanding. I want to add that I always pay my hotel bill when I arrive so I paid not only for the Erguvan on my first night but the 2nd hotel. Also, when I arrived I had to request to not be charged as much for the smaller room. You might ask, why did you accept when you arrive? I was tired and caught off guard but came to my senses after returning to the Erguvan for the evening after walking around Sultanamet. The Erguvan is well situated and clean but the supervisor difinitely made a mess of my reservation this time. I've stayed at this hotel 4 times before this last incident. Finally the night clerk never has the correct bill. Five times during early morning checkout, he has asked me if I've paid for an item that was settled during the day! Next time, I'll book somehwere else as there are many new hotels in the area that really are 4 star because they have more modern accomodations. The Erguvan's selling point is the seaview on the terrace where there are dining accomodations. This blunder may have been just poor planning by the supervisor and should never have happened!", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "WinnipegRob", "ReviewID": "UR85592105", "Content": "My wife & I spent 5 nights at the Erguvan Hotel Istanbul in October 2010.

Bad points: The service. See below. The price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were quoted 120 Euros if paid by cash and 140 if paid by card, which was very expensive for a place that was really only 3-star. You pay for the location. In-hotel noise was very audible from inside the room and was more disturbing than the outside noise. We had booked a standard room with two beds, as I was travelling with my teenage daughter. When we arrived, the clerk informed us he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrading\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd us from a standard room to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sea view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room with a king bed, as the hotel was full and they only had that room or a single room left. Faced with this incompetence, we had little choice but to accept. We discussed an airport transfer for the next morning, and I booked the transfer for 11.30am so that I would be able to pay at the hotel and not have to deal with Turkish taxi drivers. Incidentally, the clerk did not pose the usual question of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how do you intend to pay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so avoided reminding me about their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discount\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for cash. The staff member who then \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd us to our rooms threw our suitcases into the lift, sprinted up the stairs and literally \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd us our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he pointed at the door, then left. I was startled by this brusqueness, as even in lesser-starred hotels it is usual for a staff member to open your room, check everything is okay, point out the mini-bar and show you how the TV works. The next morning, I was similarly taken aback by the indifference of the breakfast staff, who appeared to studiously ignore the guests. Heaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake, guys! A smile costs nothing, and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a translator! In addition to apparently not being interested in greeting guests or letting them know what options were available, they left empty trays of food/bowls of yoghurt un-replenished. The choices were only okay, too, certainly nothing special. After feeling less than welcomed, we checked out (having to pay by card since I had forgotten about the cash discount - watch out for their sharp practice of converting their Euro price into Turkish Lira at who-knows-what exchange rate before running it through the EFTPOS machine), and enquired about the airport transfer we had booked. Shake of the head. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not here till 12.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Short discussion followed, but no, the transfer vehicle was otherwise engaged, leaving me with no option but to get a taxi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the very last thing I wanted to do in Istanbul. Of course, the inevitable happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had to endure just about every thieving Istanbul Taxi driver trick in the book. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bore you with the details, but the taxi driver in question (TPL09, by the way) tried four identifiable cons, including the note-change trick and trying to lock my 14-year-old daughter in the car. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let him get away with any of them, but ended up very shaken after the ensuing shouting match. Why blame the hotel for that, I hear you ask? Because it was a situation that I knew existed and tried my best to avoid, and if the hotel staff had had the decency and competence to inform me ahead of time that they could not fill my transfer booking, I would have organised to take the airport shuttle or the train.

Not to worry though since ZERO problems. Our room (#13) was very clean and the maid service excellent. Breakfast was wonderful: black olives, green olives, meats, three types of feta cheese, a braided string cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, freshly cooked cheese fingers, potatoe blitzes, sesame bread as well as cereal and granola all in a nice buffet that opened at 8. Coffee, tea and orange juice also. Yummy. The view of the Blue Mosque from the patio is very good as well as the ancient retaining wall of the Hippodrome.

They would not pressure you to book tours with them. It is really up to you to decide. No matter how late you come back, there is always someone sitting on the front desk to welcome you.

BUT\u201d", "Author": "Bhoodie", "ReviewID": "UR5702621", "Content": "We arrived thinking it was a pretty good place in terms of location and initial hospitality. We got to our rooms- there were 3 of us girlfriends and we were happy that the place was ok. Our room- Number 36- the most upper and last room on the 3rd floor smelt a little musty but that was probably because as we later discovered, was the only room that was carpeted. The bathroom had a layer of scum from the previous occupants in it but we thought they'd see this on our second day and said nothing to upset anyone. When we saw that on the second day the cleaner had not cleaned the bath, we asked the kind lady at reception who was much nicer on our first day, who seemed uninterested and fobbed our comments away as she had no empathy about what we were trying to say and she said she'd deal with it. On our return we'd found our floor mats in the bathrom had not been replaced and still the scum had not been cleaned. Day 3 we tried speaking to the receptionist again and she said she knew it wasn't clean and she was on it and she was the lady to get it done. Day 3 on our return it still hadn't been done. As the receptionts are changed after a certain number of hours and they are very short staffed, the recpetionist had changed in the evening to a gentleman. I was a little angry by now as we had to shower amongst someone else's scum- so I went down to speak to someone face to face regarding the cleanliness of our room. The fellow said we were right to be annoyed but they had no cleaning products. When i mentioned our carpets were not clean from the day we moved in- he said that they were not able to give the room a clean from the last residents as they were rushed and understaffed. That was disgusting. That was not an excuse and we surely had not paid the full fee of staying there to not be provided with what we'd paid for. He told us that they usually had 2 cleaners for their 36 rooms and right then they only had 1. I said that was no excuse but as he wasn't the boss he couldn't do much about it. He said he'd go out the following morning and he'd get the detergents himself to clean the bathrooms. Day 4 the bathroom actually gets cleaned- not greatly, but atleast we couldn't feel the gritty scum when we showered in the tub. Everyday, breakfast time on the terrace, and although there was a beautiful view, there were never enough dishes to take the breakfasts on. No cups, no cutlery. As we'd complained so many times about the bathroom and the state of our room, staff who spoke english became very unco-operative there. Day 5, 6 & 7 we learnt that the bathroom wasn't being cleaned again and decided it was a waste of time to waste our energy that we wanted to store to have a good time there and stayed at friend's places where we slept and showered to avoid the nasty treatment we were getting especially from the female staff. It was a shame that we had such an awful experience that ruined a beautiful country experience. If you like to breath in clean air and like to clean yourselves in clean bathrooms- then this place is not for you. If you just want to go to sleep in and you're not too bothered about hygiene and hospitality then it's not too bad. The view from the terrace during breakfast is beautiful but it was a shame the staff weren't as beautiful as the whole of Istanbul.", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel in a perfect location\u201d", "Author": "KellyNewZealand", "ReviewID": "UR5418457", "Content": "A friend and I spent a week at the Erguyan Hotel in May and I could not rate them higher. This was without a doubt the most pleasant place we stayed in while travelling within Europe over four months.

They made us fell so welcome and we felt as if we had been welcomed into their home rather than a hotel. They seemed genuinely interested in helping us to plan our days and also to hear about what we had been up to when we got home each day. We spent quite a bit of time chatting with Bugra and Eyup and their friends who also came to visit so it was nice to spend time with locals and play backgammon with them. The location is brilliant. It is in the Sultanahmet district and is just around the corner form the blue mosque and in fact the restaurant terrace has incredible views of the Blue Mosque. This hotel is within walking district of all the main tourist attractions and loads of restaurants as well. The room was a very good size. We had a lot of luggage and we never felt like we were tripping over ourselves. The noise from the hallway can be quite loud but we never heard any noise from the adjoining rooms. Breakfast was very good with a selection of breads, fresh veges, olives, cereals, yoghurt, fruit, cakes, tea, coffee, juice, eggs. We certainly never left breakfast hungry and felt that we had eaten healthy fresh food. The rate for this room was very reasonable. It is much better than some of the hotels at the top of this list however they would need to be flawless to consider paying the additional money. I was very happy with the value for money.
