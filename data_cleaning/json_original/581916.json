{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Simple and affordable accomodation I went for a solo trip to japan in October, and after some research, i stumbled across Amista Asagaya. Booked a single room for the first half of the trip and then a double for the second half of the trip (room was booked at different times). The hotel happily accommodated me on my travel requirements.Located in a somewhat mid-classed residential area, Amista Asagaya is the perfect poster child of a business hotel - no-fuss accomodation.The single room is perfect for a single guy - a super-single bed with thick comforter for those chilly nights. A LCD tv, minibar and complimentary green tea completes the room. They also included a press iron, a first for me, for ironing purposes. Free shampoo and body wash is also included.For the free internet, it is required to ask the front desk for the network cable if you don't have any. There is an italian restaurant at the lobby of the hotel, and along the way to the hotel there are several restaurants and even a bakery if you are more inclined to eat something else.One ubiquitous facet of japanese life - the vending machine - is also available in the hotel.The double room was also comfortable to stay in, with generally the same amenities as the single room.The staff is friendly and helpful with some English knowledge, although i feel that a little bit of Japanese phrases goes a long way in getting more hospitability.", "Date": "Dec 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR381119963", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MemerangLaut"}, {"Content": "Good stay, good deal       One piece bathroom.", "Date": "Apr 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR241048204", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lightbulbbender"}, {"Content": "Great budget hotel in Tokyo       hallway", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR349927991", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kimchiSeoul"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066458-d581916-r22715755-Amista_Asagaya-Suginami_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "581916", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
