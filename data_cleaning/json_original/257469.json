The hotel is definitely quite stylish with a warehouse conversion look by the Cowper Wharf. The location is good for business travellers as it is close to the CBD but still far enough for relaxation in the evenings. It is also connected to some of the best restaurants in Sydney. Loft rooms are nice with separate living room downstairs but the bathrooms can sometimes be too small. The breakfast room service costs is ridiculous. You are charged per sausage piece and per bacon rash. There is no all inclusive American Breakfast. The Water Bar is a nice quiet spot during the week to get a drink. There is hardly any crowds and you can chat with your partners and friends comfortably.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cWait for a Refurbishment!\u201d", "Author": "HolidayGalQld", "ReviewID": "UR128257374", "Content": "Lovely boutique hotel from outside and cool interior.

Think dark, pokey, stained carpets, moudly grouting in bathroom, stains on sink. Bathrooms so tiny its like you are staying on a boat. On the plus side it has a cool bar and its in a fabulous location. We walked to Surry Hills/Paddington/City/Circular Quay/Potts Point/Kings Cross etc. Unfortunately it just has very VERY tired rooms. Would give it a 3 and a half, 4 star max. Its like schoolies have stayed a week before you. Generally clean but needs a good scrub. Needs a major in room refurbishment to call itself a 5 star hotel. New paint, carpet, bathroom clean and something over the windows so you dont have to look at the terrible view would be a start. Has great potential but Taj if thats the quality of your hotels we won't be booking any of them any time soon. Hope they renovate as then it would be fab.

The access is a bit restricted but valet parking is on offer. Room access is limited to one slow elevator with a slightly eccentric control system which can be mildly frustrating as there is no alternative staircase available. The superior room I enjoyed was most comfortable with a very attractive bathroom. However it was very difficult to adjust the temperature on both the slow running bath and the shower and it took a little experimenting to find how to get a comfortable water temperature with diametrically opposite tap settings. The room I stayed in was exposed to noise from revellers in the street nearby at the weekend but that comes with the territory in such a characterful building. The room turn down service and servicing was the best I can recall encountering, however some of the front desk staff let the side down. They gave the appearance of being inflexible and unhelpful, and resorted to bluff on occasion rather than admit they didn't know giving the impression that they were not experienced or well trained. More senior desk staff were available on request and speedily resolved all issues.

Beautiful fresh orange juice and eggs benedict was perfectly done, could not fault it. They don't have a restaurant in the hotel which you don't need as there are so many good ones close by.

The service is very professional and of a 5 star standard. I mean military \"mission impossible \" perfect - the receptionist greets you by your name before you even get to the desk as the concierge who takes your bag as you approach the entrance has a bluetooth headset on and must tell them. The pool/gym is a bit of a walk from the main hotel and is shared with local apartments by the looks of things. Nice facility if a little small. The rooms are of a very good size for a major city and have nice views of the marina. I would say they are starting to date and need taking to the next level if they are to compete with the other hotels in Sydney. It used to be a W hotel which is a very good brand and have lovely hotels across the world, I am not sure what Taaj have done to it ? If anything ? But some new furniture would not go a miss.

(Yes courtesy of the little speaker connected to the concierge and teh reception 'overhears' the name). We were taken to our loft by the same concierge who was very friendly and helpful...yet, alas, the magic of this whole process waned a little when less than 10 minutes later, my husband returned from parking our car and the same concierge greeted him and asked whether he wanted to check in! Loft had everything you could need, nice view of the pier and was roomy enough. We went to the Water Bar for cocktails prior to our night out, groovy ambience, which surprisingly wasnt busy. The attention to detail was very good,although the cocktails were a little below par and they took a little too long to be delivered by the waitress after the barman had made them.

The staff were excellent and very pleasant and helpful. We chose a loft room for something a bit different, but the room was a lot smaller than it looked on the website. The loft bedroom had a tiny wardrobe, but there was another full sized wardrobe downstairs so that was more convenient to use, which meant going up and down the stairs if you needed anything. There was always a line of taxis waiting out the front, but everything eg town, theatres etc are at least a $20 or $30 taxi ride away. Having a hire car or taking your own car isnt worthwhile as parking is $50 per day. There is a little restaurant and a bar within the hotel, but we didnt try them....though they both looked quite popular. There are many other restaurants on the wharf under the hotel and Harrys Cafe de Wheels (a Sydney Icon) very near the front of the hotel. In summary the Blue Sydney is a really lovely hotel with a couple of minor space issues. The staff are lovely but the location needs to be taken into account as the cost of taxis add a lot more to what is already a higher priced hotel.

A friend had recommended Blue, and I thought it looked perfect . . both in terms of building/accommodation, as well as location - walking distance to both CBD and Botanic Gardens (and round to Opera House). We checked in about 11am Monday morning, and were surprised to learn our room was ready . . only problem was there was a bit of a mix-up (Blue's fault) with the booking and we'd been given a room with view of the pier (looking out to Pott's Point) rather than the city. This was quickly resolved by the manager, who upgraded us to a Lunar Loft Suite - a fantastic, and greatly appreciated treat! Our porter described these rooms as the \"best in the house\", and it was clear to see why - a two-level suite, with huge lounge / dining room on ground floor, and loft-style bedroom and bathroom on second floor. Blinds on the big windows and skylights could be opened to reveal great view out past Woolloomooloo Wharf towards the city. In short, the room and its various amenities were superb. The location suited us just fine - we'd bought our running gear, and went for a nice run through the gardens and around the waterfront to the Opera House and back. We walked into town to meet friends - there are numerous paths 'up and over' the hill to the CBD. We caught a couple of taxis to/from the hotel - easy.

Reading a few reviews of this place they seem to be mixed. We certainly didn't have any issue although it could have been interesting.. We started with Valet parking which I read was as easy as arriving at the doorstep. It was. The German guy (Nicolas) who greeted us and took the car was fantastic and certainly raised the service bar from the start. He was friendly, interested and happy to talk and greet us to the hotel. Great start. Walking into the hotel the team greeted us and took the very few bags we had and waited while we checked in. Checkin was simple and we were shown to our room, shown how to work everything and left to enjoy the fairly unique view over the docks with Warship and Queen Mary 2 in sight. 1 small hiccup, on checking our booking we had booked a different style room. I walked down and pointed this out and was compensated with breakfast being included and to apologise they sent up a bottle of red wine. A great way to start a dinner date. While this was happening the staff (Kate, Front Desk) was apologetic and seemed to genuinely be sorry that the mistake had occurred. Our room was a king room on the pier side, the bath and bathroom were great and we had no trouble with noise. I expect when the Waterbar is very busy, noise might be interesting as our room door was about 20 feet above the floor level of the bar. Midweek it was quiet and the city seemed far away. We walked along the pier in the evening and the next morning walked over to Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Great walk and such a great view of the city. I would love to stay longer and explore the area more on foot. For dinner we took a taxi (lazy us) to Kings Cross and had a great meal at a Japanese restaurant and walked back down the hill to the hotel. Breakfast was one of the best we have had in a hotel. Fresh, enough choice and the service (Krishna) was attentive and friendly. They knew who we were and that breakfast had been included.

I stayed at Blue Sydney as part of my recent honeymoon in Australia and the experience was fantastic. Blue Sydney is located at Woolloomooloo Wharf and whilst not located in the CBD or at Circular Quay for me the location is amazing. The Wharf is about 10 minutes walk if you go through the Botanical Gardens or say 30-40 minutes if you choose the scenic walk via Boy Charlton Pool, Mrs Macquarie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chair and of course the spectacular views of the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. That walk is so amazing and you never get bored of it! Woolloomooloo is a fun location to stay in when you are in Sydney. The hotel is near the legendary Harry's Cafe de Wheels (give the pies a miss, the Hot Dog de Wheels is the best) and the restaurants on the wharf are superb - people tend to rave about Otto and China Doll but I really love Aki's - if you love Indian food you really should go to Aki's. Blue Sydney is also near the lively areas of Darlinghurst and the slightly dodgier (bit still fun) King's Cross. On our honeymoon we went to China Doll and thought it was good value for money for the amazing food and great view. The Water Bar may no longer be the \"it\" place to go in Sydney - it seems to have lost some of its prestige compared to when I first lived in Sydney - but honestly we still though it the well mixed cocktails were great.

The hotel is set within an old wharf buildling, half of which is the hotel, the other half private apartments. The hotel has a wonderful sense of history and although it is clearly a luxury boutique Taj property, the building has not be changed visually. The ground floor has the Water bar and restaurant, the upper levels (think of an atrium style hotel inside) have the rooms and suites, which either look over the marina or the naval base. I was put into a marina view room and all the rooms are significantly larger than an ordinary hotel room. The bathroom was huge, separate shower to the bath (how nice is that), plenty of hanging space, tea/coffee, iron, decent hairdryer, WIFI access in the room $9 per 24 hours, yes per 24 hours or about $56 for a week. If you didn't bring a laptop, there are four computer stations on each floor which are available for guests. If you want to do printing, take a thumb drive and the reception will print off documents (for a small fee probably, I didn't try it). The bed was large and most importantly it was comfortable with a large pillow menu. The room was very clean, furnished sufficiently for two people and in muted colours. It isn't at all fussy or OTT like some hotels. I had some excellent tapas type dishes down in the Waterbar (www.waterbaratblue.com)washed down with a lovely cocktail. This bar has won many awards and justifiably so. I also tried room service and the prices were amazing ranging from $25 to $35 on average for excellent food, beautifully presented and delicious. This isn't really a hotel for families but it would definitely suit couples and corporates. It takes about 15 minutes from the airport to reach Woolloomooloo and about the same amount of time, depending on traffic, to walk into the heart of Sydney CBD. It would be an excellent place to meet up for business or leisure as there are at least 5 restaurants on the wharf for meals.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat\u201d", "Author": "Jodie M", "ReviewID": "UR116726854", "Content": "Loved the room and location.

The hotel is built on the old Docks storehouses, and integrates some of the old features in its design. It has a pleasant ambience and trendy atmosphere without being pretentious. We had one of the more basic rooms which had a skylight and only a high window but this was fine with us. Beds were very comfortable (they offer a choice of pillows but we were happy with the down ones provided). It was simply but attractively decorated, which we liked, though if you prefer something more opulent/traditional this is not for you. The view was outside whenever you wanted to go there. The setting couldn't be better. There are good views of Sydney Harbour and Wooloomoloo marina (there are more expensive rooms that have a choice of views) - it was also close to the Domain, the NSW Art Gallery, a scenic walk through the gardens to the Opera House, and Circular Quay and a short walk from the city, though if you don't or can't walk it is not as central as other hotels. Taxis are usually available outside, and we don't recommend walking up to and around Kings Cross after dark, especially on quieter nights. Our room was directly off the mezzanine area above the bars and restaurant - quiet for most of the time, but it may not be on busier weekends - we weren't there when the Friday night bar crowds assemble. Rooms further away from this area should be quieter. On the downside, the breakfast was expensive but very ordinary, and on one day we tried the Italian/Turkish cafe over the road which was just as good, friendlier and half the price. Parking is also ridiculously expensive as there is no parking in the hotel itself and the staff take your car away somewhere and bring it back when you check out. The hotel recommends some of the restaurants along the wharf. We tried their recommendation of 'China Doll' and found it excellent. This is a great place for a couples weekend, business or overseas visitors.

We had a Deluxe Double room with 2 small double beds, a very spacious room with a lovely big bathroom and huge tub. Very clean, plenty of towels and housekeeping replaced all used toiletries/ tea/ coffee etc at turndown.

The front desk staff did the minimum they had to with a smile.

I looked at hotel policies and the book and also asked the concierge, the hotel reception and also called the 24 hour hotline who all reassured me that local calls were one dollar. I called my friend in Sydney locally three times lasting less than 1-3 minutes and they charged me 107 AUD dollars! I was very upset but apparently, her phone was a mobile and not a landline and therefore they could justify charging this at checkout and stated that this was posted in the hotel book but I saw this nowhere and had checked three times, three separate people. This ruined my vacation and the polices are terrible. I will never stay here again and I go to sydney frequently, nor will i ever stay in a taj hotel. What a rip off and poorly advertised policy. If I had known and had not been mislead, I would have gotten internet and skyped for 10 cents the three phone calls. A terrible experience and not worth the almost 1000 dollars I paid to stay three nights.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cSleek and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Lizard7275", "ReviewID": "UR99189811", "Content": "The place is just visiting to watch the building, the rooms are spacious, elegant and comfortable.

The hotel only makes up for a portion of this extensive building and the rooms surround, on a couple of different levels, what apparently is a nightclub/function room. A previous poster indicated that they experienced really bad noise levels arising from from this area which was being used as a nightclub during a weekend. We approached this information with some apprehension as we were staying on a Saturday night. On leaving the hotel about 7pm a crowd was gathering, we made some inquiries and learnt that it was a private function. On returning to the hotel about midnight from the movies, the crowd was dispersing and caused no noise problems. ** It would certainly be worthwhile for intending weekend visitors to check before making booking. Overall the hotel is in a great location, surrounded by restaurants and the iconic \" Harry's Cafe de Wheels\" is 100 metres down the street. The view from the room, overlooking Garden Island and the Navy ships at anchor, was pleasant. The A/C on a particulary hot/humid weekend was efficent. Bathroom large and everything working ok. Check in/out was flawless as was the attention to detail, options of turning down beds, newspapers, valet service etc. It would be fair to say that we have in recent years travelled extensively in Europe, South America and always had the option of FREE Wi Fi available in even the smallest pensions, being asked to pay $AUD 7.00 per hour in a hotel that is quite expensive by any standard is really \"excessive gouging\".

Finally I booked marina king room for two nights (costed me around $340/day) for my wedding night in the end of October. My fiance (wife now) and I moved in there a night before the wedding night. The hotel staff was incredibly polite and nice to us. They kept repeating \"whatever you need, just press that button on the phone, remember - whatever you need, and we'll be there for you\". First night we ordered in-room movie, but it started glitching in the middle of watching. We called the reception, and they said that it's a technical problem and that they will not charge us for it. They really did not. Bathrooms are huge, plenty of space to walk in, nice bathtub and shower cabin. The view out of the king marina room was incredible! I was staring in the window all morning and evening watching boats and fishermans on the wharf. The hotel located near the botanic gardens - my another most favourite place in Sydney. For tourists visiting Sydney it is a \"must visit\" place. We had a number of wedding visitors, such as hairdresser, florist, photographer, bridal party, all coming to the hotel, and reception would call us to inform about their arrival and letting them in upstairs. No hastle at all. From the negative side, i think the hotel is too expensive for what it offers. We ordered a piece of cake to the room for kids, and they charged $20 for it. Bottled water is not free in the room, it was something around $9-$11. No free internet, in fact it was so expensive, I did not even bother using it. There is no free parking around. Hotel charges $40 for valet parking, but I must admit, it is a convenient option if you do not stay there for too long. On one ocasion, they brought someone's car instead of ours, so we had to wait a bit longer in the lobby. We did not have time to dine in the restaurants and cafes downstairs, but heard that they are too pricey as well. Well I think for the location like that they should be, just like everywhere in Sydney. There was some noticeable dust layer on the bottles in the minibar. Possibly guests might not even touched it for months because of high in-room prices. The furniture in the lobby looks a bit worn out. The checkout is very early - 10am, however when we asked for a late checkout, we were allowed to stay till 11am.

Nobody from Blue helped me into the car or even nodded in my direction, my sister was left out front for 20 minutes desperately trying to flag down a taxi, something that the Blue staff seemingly could not achieve... it was just a bit weird I guess, I was nervous enough heading off to my wedding ceremony and thought helping my (small) family with the taxi situation would be part of Blue's job. On our wedding night the music coming from the bar downstairs was really pumping until midnight, and the bar was next to empty. I know this is a common concern for many guests of Blue and think it's almost time for management to look at the bigger picture. I'm not sure the super loud music is going to attract anybody extra to the venue, and if anything it inspires guests to 'rethink' any return trip, especially with so many good accommodation deals available in Sydney.

We could choose any cocktail on this list which was fantastic. The house keep staff was friendly and very kind to us, and couldn not have been more helpfull. An added bouns in our Hotel Stay.

While I wouldn't say this hotel is in the most convenient location (especially if you just want to do the touristy Harbour, Quay, Opera House stuff), it's far from inconvenient. In fact, it's just a short walk to the funky Potts Point area. And the Quay, Opera House area is still within walking distance (you hardly notice it since you're walking through the beautiful Botanic Gardens). I was a little concerned since some reviews said the area felt unsafe or dodgy, but I completely disagree. There's always people around and I never felt like my safety was compromised in any way. The Cafe du Wheels right outside the hotel is a fun alternative to the pricey Sydney cuisine, as well.

Its walking distance to the fabulous Boy Charlton Swimming Pool, the Botanic Gardens, the City, plus a short journey anyway in central Sydney or North Sydney or the Eastern Suburbs etc, very easy to get on all the freeways that go further out. The restaurants along the wharf are sensational. Possibly why their own bar is a bit empty which is unfortunate. There are some issues with the rooms, due to the nature of the building. The loft rooms are a bit of an odd layout, but are enormous. The breakfast could be improved - great fresh juices, great coffee, great cooked eggs etc but bircher muesli and porride a bit boring. The gym is small, but still useable. If you love running well perfect, just head up to Botanical Gardens. Swimming excellent at Boy Charlton. I stayed at the Sydney Hilton last time, but though the hotel just renovated, and the food/restaurant amazing, I personally preferred being out of the central business discrict in the city. This location hard to beat. The price at the time was nearly half the hilton for the room I chose.

Loved the candles throughout and the most amazing view one gets when coming down in the glass walled lifts in the evening. Breakfast each morning was great and once again the staff shone out.

I have just returned to Melbourne after spending two nights at Blue. How on earth they have managed to classify themselves as a 5 star hotel is completely beyond me - perhaps back in the day when the hotel first opened - but in this day and age 5 star they certaintly are not. The official website even boasts about the award they won in 2005!! Its not 2005 anymore its now 2008 move on!! I made my booking 3 weeks prior to our stay and because May is classified as \"low season\" I really didnt expect to have any problems. The day prior to arriving I called the hotel to double check my booking - they had no record on the computer of my reservation - the girl I spoke to went \"out the back\" to look through the paperwork and sure enough there was my reservation which had been forgotten about (in her words). The next day when I arrived with my partner we were greeted at the front desk by a girl who was not only dressed very badly but had no idea what she was doing. We were given a key to the third floor and on arrival found out that it defiantly was not the room I had booked. We went back downstairs to tell the girl at front reception who was very confused. She then attempted to find the room I had booked and got it wrong again!! After the third try we finally got our room. How disappointing - the room was anything but \"5 star luxury\" as is described by many websites. There were scuffs all over the walls, paint chipping off corners, scuffs on the down stairs mirror and the furniture was looking a little worse for wear. There were blue faux fur cushions on the couch that were old and matted while on our bed lay an old, pilled electric blue arcylic blanket. The paint job in the main room and the bathroom looked very cheap. But perhaps the worst thing about the hotel is on the 5th floor where the ceiling is very low as you walk up (or down) two steps into the alcove before your rooms front door. My partner who is 6ft tall was walking out the front door - the alcove has no lighting (this only comes on later at night) - he began to walk down the steps and did not see the low bearing ceiling - he hit this so hard he landed on his back on the steps with a big gash to his head. The next day he also had a very sore neck. We went downstair to tell the girl at the front desk and all she could say was \"oh!!!! oops!!!!\" There are no signs anywhere to warn tall people to look out for the low ceilings and low beams. If this had been an older person then they may have done some serious damage to themselves.

The bar in the BLUE opens from 4pm and is more focused on cocktails and wine than beer, which suited us fine. Clientele were a mix of those staying at the hotel and business types, and prices were high but the cocktails (I recommend the Emburey Martini) great. The bar also has a tapas-style menu -- again, prices are not cheap but the quality and quantity is worth it. Room service was also worth trying: this was the best in-room dining we'd ever had. Other elements of the service were fine: valet parking was efficient and the front desk dealt with my queries quickly. A missing bathrobe was replaced in a couple of minutes, for example.

Oh and Harry's De wheels is right there, not to leave out the Botanical gardens at your doorstep", "Date": "December 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAstonishing Architecture and Ambience\u201d", "Author": "TechnoProf", "ReviewID": "UR6231229", "Content": "This is a most unusual hotel and experience. The rooms are the slickest contemporary rooms I have experienced full of textures and with fine view over the harbour. The hotel is situation inside a VAST structure that is more than cathedral like. The consequence is that the communal inner space has a marvelous industrial feel but is so vast it is mostly unusable. There is a bar and cafe - breakfast in the cafe was a poor affair characterised by poor service and mediocre food - once experienced not to be repeated. There is a swimming pool\\ but few people manage to find it in the building and there is no guidance in the rooms (perhaps due to the new ownership?). Overall the experience is positive. The location is convenient being right next to the Botanical Gardens and there are a variety of local eating places either on the dockside within the building or vicinity. The hotel seemed out of style for a Taj Hotel and one wonders if such an unusual space can be made to work effectively as a business.

I have to concur in every way with the previous review, namely that the hotel is amazing and that some of the critics are too harsh. I travel very regularly on business and hence have experienced good hotels. This one is reall great. The staff if young, friendly and professional. The rooms - I had a duplex with marina view - is well organised and equipped. The gym and swimming pool are equally good. The bar has a very nice atmosphere. And equally importantly the business district is a 10min walk away through the park i.e. close enough to work but far away enough to leave the business atmosphere behind in the evenning and relax. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a stylish/boutique hotel close to the business district.", "Date": "August 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cSo it's NOT a W?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5332881", "Content": "A couple of years ago,while I was staying there I got into a discussion with a staff member of W chicago about why W hotels were becoming such a hip, cool and trendy thing. And that is the culture of collecting experiences, perhaps in a Hard Rock Cafe kind of way but less cheesy. Thing is, you expect the same high quality from all Ws but with each one being a unique experience. Each hotel is furnished and decorated in a style which suits the buildings or the city. I had stayed at W Sydney perhaps twice before during conferences and whatnot and it did differ from W in the US. It didnt feel as warm, but the Blue Whisky bars (at all W hotels) was really an experience. When I stayed at Blue, I guess I was expecting more. Gone is the 'Whatever, Whenever' motto, something I had developed a tendancy to make use of. The interior has changed a bit from what I remember and somehow it feels more icy. The service doesnt seem to emphasise all the things they used to. I waited something like an hour and a half for room service. The bartenders didn't know many of their cocktails. The people don't seem to be as friendly. In fact, it feels like they're no longer proud to work there. In my experience people working at W are very proud of its hipness and trendiness, and even though it might be a facade, to the customer thats all we want: attentive service. I know many of you might think I'm obsessed with the hotel brand, but isn't it piece of mind that you DONT worry how bad your hotel will be if you've never been there. Staying at a hotel is a gamble, even the brand name ones. At this price, you should think you've got that piece of mind, but guess what? I dont think i'll be going back. The rooms are fine, albeit getting a little rundown, but for what you pay at that price you aren't paying for the room, the view or anything like that. You are paying for the comfort,luxury and convenience, which means service. By W standards ( and I'm aware it's not W, but it is W PRICES), this does not measure up in anyway. I would have given it 5 according to my past experiences, but as Blue, I give it 3. Please consider the price and what you could get at other boutique hotels.

I was not notified by Starwood until the day prior to my arrival that it was no longer a W Hotel. The Blue Hotel is a great base to explore Sydney, you can walk to the CBD, Harbour, etc and the nearest train station is ten minutes walk at the most. The rooms are starting to look a bit tired, but the standard of house keeping was very high. My room was on the top floor so there was a reasonable view of the area. The Hotel's famous bar, was the biggest let down. The in crowd appear to have moved on, leaving a few customers behind wondering why it's not busy. Supping expensive drinks and listening to weird music. It also closes by 1 am , which is a bit weird when you come from Europe and most decent places only get going by this time .

Perfect for the late 20s-40s age groups, couples, honeymooners, and friends. Great location and about a 10 minute walk to the Opera house. The wharf building that the hotel is located in has an excellent range of restaurants and the Sydney explorer buses stop right in front of the hotel so easy for sightseeing and catching taxis. The bar in the hotel lobby is the best one we went to...all sorts of great drinks such as the blueberry mojito (my favorite). The rooms are very roomy with wonderful views of the wharf and the Botanic gardens. Great staff and hospitality. Will always stay there when I visit next...other top-rated hotels might be closer to the Opera house or the Darling Harbour but this one is the best overall experience and is in a better location in my opinion.
