Location - great! just a block uphill from the ferry in Isabel Segunda. Right in the center of town - near the funky but serviceable grocery store, near a wonderful PINK coffeeshop, near a couple of awesome, expensive restaurants where we enjoyed some of our best meals in Puerto Rico, and short cab ride to Esmerelda for lovely beach and luminescent biobay. The room: funky eau-de-mildew moist indoor-outdoor carpet, incomplete paint job, ikky cheap panelling, bathroom had been cleaned but reeked of Lysol. Unbelieveable waterfront view! But don't look down - the pool appeared not to have been cleaned in ... decades - it was nasty! I was on a romantic birthday trip to Puerto Rico, and although I initially wavered, I decided to have a good sense of humor - and we ended up staying there 2 nights and had a wonderful time. Unfortunately I left my down pillow in the room, so if you wonder what amenities come with that room that costs extra, it's probably my down pillow! This room could have (and for others, would have) ruined our trip - but it became the story we still laugh about. If I were going again I might even stay there - but one should know what one is getting into.", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cStay at your own risk\u201d", "Author": "dragonfly0187", "ReviewID": "UR30859701", "Content": "I was traveling with my kids ages 8 and 9. Our stay at the ocean view was very spur of the moment and cheap. The room it's self was not really clean. The bed did not have a blanket on it only a bottom and top sheet. The air conditioner did work however the toilet didn't work and management did come and fix the problem. I didn't attempt to use the shower or much of the sink. The bathroom it self was more frightening than the creepy room. The pool is very small and filthy and my kids who love the water wouldn't go near it. The television didn't work well. Our room had a balcony over the pool and over looking the ocean. and that was the best part of our stay. The ocean was close enough to spit on. And our view was fabulous. If you can avoid staying here and find something better I would. But it is cheap and very close to the ferry. It is within walking distance to a small restaurant (the only one open on Sunday) We were able to arrange transportation at the front desk to take us to the beach on the other side of the island. I am not sure if I got a good deal on that. a 10 minute ride cost me 15 dollars each way. I would love to go back to Vieques but I would stay somewhere else. The view from our balcony was spectacular but that was the only thing that was spectacular. I recommend the beach at Sun Bay. The sunset was beyond words but this hotel was almost worse than a hostel I stayed at in asia in the middle of the rainforest with some really big bugs. Not all the hotels or inns allow children so if you are traveling with them make sure you ask.

I think its the cheapest on the island so keep very low expectations and you'll be ok. Side note: One thing to keep in mind is if you are going to the biobay, make a deal with the driver or tour company to drop you back off to this hotel right after because otherwise you will be stuck in esperanza which is on the south side of the island with no means of transport back to the ferry side (isabella) where this hotel is, and that area gets very risky at night", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orem, Utah", "Title": "\u201cCheap and clean... enough.\u201d", "Author": "scotglen", "ReviewID": "UR14830885", "Content": "Was lucky to find this room on the same day after I missed the early ferry trip which then necessitated that I spend the night.

I booked a room at this hotel blindly because my plans changed and I needed a place to stay. It was inexpensive, and my husband and I figured \"How bad could it be?\" Yes, it can be that bad. The room was worse than a prison cell. At least in prison they can hang up photos. The walls were various shades of beige, grime, and mold. And completely bare. There was a bed in the middle of the room and nothing else. The windows were broken. The bathroom was last updated 50 years ago, and I was afraid to take my shoes off in the room. We had to wait for the cleaning lady to finish before she let us in the room, and I saw only towels in the laundry basket and no sheets, so I'm not entirely sure they change the sheets after each visitor. There was a random door opening up to a \"balcony\" that looked over the nasty, noisy street below. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. We left and found another place to stay in Esperanza, which even though it cost us twice as much at least we didn't inhale too much of whatever mold was growing on the ceiling. The only bonus was leaving- they gave us all our money back.
