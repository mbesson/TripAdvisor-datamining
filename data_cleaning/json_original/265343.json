Our last trip, which took place in early October, was organized at the last minute when a client asked my husband to attend a trade fair. (Like he was going to say no... Paris?? Free???) The hotel in which we usually stay was booked - probably because of all the stellar TA reviews - but they kindly provided us with a few other recommendations, one of which was Hotel Apollon. Pros: - Reasonably priced (for Paris, as I already mentioned) - Extra-clean, especially the bathroom - Bathroom recently renovated and, for its size, offers a remarkable amount of space on which to put your stuff. - Plentiful - and HOT - water in shower - Friendly and helpful front desk personnel - Great neighborhood with some absolutely outstanding restaurants. (We actually prefer this neighborhood to the one in which we usually stay. It's a real place, with real cafes that actual Parisians visit - not just tourists or traveling businesspeople.) - Metro exactly one block away - Free Wi/Fi that works exceptionally well. (Note: I had no problem whatsoever with getting a new code every day. Heck and it's just an elevator ride downstairs, something that can be accomplished in less than 5 minutes.) - The room has a small frig. Cons: - The rooms are small, which is absolutely typical for this type of Parisian hotel. To me, it's not really a con, but for many it might be --- so fair warning. - Because the rooms are small, the walls get a bit of abuse from luggage. Consequently, the wall paper in both the halls and the rooms is beginning to get pretty dinged up. - The carpeting thruout really needs to be replaced. It's not totally disgusting, but is showing its age and the wear and tear that it receives. - Clothes storage is pretty much non-existent. There's a tiny (and I might add, very dusty) closet in the room. It holds four shirts, two business suits, one raincoat -- and bursts at the seams. - Storage for luggage in also non-existent. The only saving grace is that the beds are on legs, not on a platform. We were able to shove my husband's suitcase under a bed. I had to keep mine out because that's where my clothes lived during our stay. I might add that I must have stubbed my doggone toe on the doggone suitcase about 35 times. - The beds were not at all comfortable. By day two we were both complaining of aching backs and we're both pretty fit people. - The sheets were quite clean and crisp, but the blanket really could have used a good wash. - Our beds didn't get a bedspread put on them until the third day. When we arrived, it was just sheets and a blanket. Bottom Line: Would I stay there again? Yes, if there were no other options. I think, however, next time we go to Paris we'll return to the neighborhood, but look for a different hotel.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergerac, France", "Title": "\u201cVery helpful staff and good value for money\u201d", "Author": "SandraB1962", "ReviewID": "UR119252491", "Content": "We stayed here for one night 11 Oct and found the hotel to be very comfortable.

I fully expected that we would not be able to check into our room, but Monsieur Joel, at the front desk, was extremely friendly and accomodating. My French was fair, but certainly not as good as I anticipated. Fortunately, Monsieur Joel spoke perfect English, and was obliged to do so. The entire hotel had been recently renovated and looked great. The rooms were a little small (typical for Paris), but very clean and comfortable. Our room overlooked an adjacent street, but the double-glazed window was very quiet. The price of the room was affordable for Paris, and the hotel was a short 10-minute metro ride from the primary museums and attractions. The petit-dejeuner was extra, but very welcomed. I definitely recommend this hotel, and I will stay here again on my next trip to Paris.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vevey, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cNice surprise\u201d", "Author": "ellabella_8", "ReviewID": "UR111565581", "Content": "On previous trips to Paris, we have stayed in the more touristy areas.

Everything is in excellent condition, clean and attractive in the hotel, making it appealing to us as tourists and comfortable for business travel. Since we had 34-hours of travel time from home (in the U.S.) to Paris, the management provided us a quiet room, away from the street, to assist in conquering our impending jetlag. It was easy to fall asleep, because the room was dark and quiet. We slept for 22 hours and then, refreshed, we enjoyed our time exploring the Montparnasse area. The staff, including Joel and Alain who assisted us, were especially helpful in recommending places to eat and shop and in making us feel very comfortable upon our arrival and throughout our stay.

All of this was no surprise as all of the reviews stated so on TripAdvisor. The real surprise was the hotel receptionist, Joel. He was without a doubt the most helpful receptionist we have ever met. It did not hurt that my wife is Brazillian and we both speak Portuguese, as Joel is Portuguese as well. But he was simply awesome! He told us all of the great places to go, and even went through great lengths to book a reservation for us to a Cabaret show on our last night. I can't say enough about how much he helped make our trip one of the best ever. If you ever go to Paris you have to stay at this hotel. You absolutely will not regret it. A couple of points to know. Plan on arriving after 2PM as it was the case for us that our rooom was not available when we arrived in the morning. That wasn't a big deal for us but you might want to make note of that. Also, our room was a little small, but then again, we didn't spend much time there so it wasn't an issue for us at all. It was clean, comfortable and even a little \"cozy\".

No fuss, no lengthy wait whilst processing a credit card guarantee, just a distinctive focus on getting us to our rooms as quickly as possible with minimum amounts of fuss! This enabled us to then find a local Bar ( Bar 57) across from the hotel to eat and drink and keep our three travel weary teenagers very happy! Yes the rooms are small but who cares, we visited Paris to see the City not spend hours in our hotel bedroom! The bathrooms were small too but a powerful shower and good lighting enabled me to feel clean and my wife to put her make up on without complaining about the poor light very often found in more upmarket hotels! The hotel was quiet with little invasion of traffic noise so a great sleep always followed the drinks we downed at Bar 57. Breakfast was a treat too! Down in the cellar an attractive breakfast of croissant, bread, fruit, cereal, yoghurt etc was served with a smile. Our children's request for milky hot chocolate was always met with enthusiasm and each day was set up perfectly following Le Petit Dejeuner. All members of staff went out of their way to help with restaurant recommendations and things to see. Overall a super hotel in a non touristy part of the city that was within 200m of the metro.

Hotel Apollo is located in the Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris which is a little off of the beaten path. By staying here and shopping and eating in the neighborhood visitors will get a taste of what \"real Paris\" is like. Within a block or two are cafes, brasseries, and stores of all types.

This being said, if you are out at any of the Parisian hot spots our eating in the trendy neighborhoods, when you're done, you have to trek back to the hotel. There is not a thriving social scene in this section of Montparnasse. We stayed in room 3 which was an average size European hotel room. The bathroom looked to have been recently renovated and the shower had great water pressure and temperature. The bathroom door didn't really latch completely and the deadbolt on the room door did't function but we decided these were not enough of an issue to switch rooms.

Two main complaints: 1) there's a strict \"no food in the rooms\" policy, which made it difficult to eat quick/cheap breakfast or dinner in the room, something we hoped to do and something that was almost necessary with a small child. Paradoxically, there was a fridge in the room, so we kept milk and juice on hand to tide us over until we could get our croissants nearby.

The fact that there is free Wi-Fi also made it easy for me to keep in contact with my husband and children via my laptap in my room. The room was small, but that is to be expected in Europe. The hotel has been redone within the last few years, and they keep it clean and orderly. It is a small hotel, but I'm fond of this type of hotel. The maid service and food service was on the slow side and seemed a tad disgruntled, but friendly and professional for the most part. The neighborhood is one of the best features of this hotel for me. It's really on the edge of Montparnasse, so you don't get the super touristy ritzy aspects of the heart of Montparnasse. Also, it's a hop-skip-jump away from the metro and there's a great cafe right up the street. There are two groceries stores nearby, and just about any kind of other store you'd like, including a charming little toy store around the corner. The people in the neighborhood were, in my experience, friendly to Americans and affable. Ultimately, you get what you pay for...a charming little room, helpful front desk, a sweet neighborhood and a decent overall stay. If you are looking for luxury or American-style rooms and staff, you'll have to pay a much higher price in a far more touristy neighborhood.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "Title": "\u201cCharming, great service, great local location\"\u201d", "Author": "gigi385", "ReviewID": "UR36257318", "Content": "We loved this hotel.

The spicy shrimp and the \"sugar\" pork fed a family of 4 for 29 euros!) For a more parisian taste, the Cafe Metro was very good. Traveling with 4 it's impossible to find rooms in Paris in June, but they put us up in two adjoining rooms. Desk clerk was ALWAYS friendly, owner drew us a map to the bus stop to the airport (5 minute walk) saving us $100 on a taxi ride. Free Wi-Fi (pronounced wee-fee) in all rooms.

My wife and myself were in this Hotel for 3 nights in the month of May, Booking was done directly with the Hotel and I must admit that despite being a typical Parisian Hotel the response was super fast!!! The front desk team especially Emmanual and Yohannan are excellent communicator and speak reasonably good English. They would even go an extra mile to help you out. We have had heard a lot about typical Parisian attitude, but mercifully this Hotel does not show them any. We got a special internate rate of 110 Euro per night with breakfast for a double,not bad at all looking at other Hotel's rate this was a steal!!! They send me a clear direction,how to reach to the Hotel beforehand and till that time I was overawed by their efficiency. The location is good,but it is subjective! If you are familiar with Paris Metro then Line 13 is not a problem at all. Though it was my first time in Paris but I did a fair amount of homework to familiarize myself with the complexity of Paris metro. Thank God!! It turned out to be gold! We could explore Paris to the tee in the shortest possible time due to Metro.We came back with a very high opinion about Paris Metro,and would strongly suggest people to use it to avoid the traffic and it is quite cheap too. A box of 10 tickets (Carnet) costs us 11.40 Euro,each ticket can be used as long as you are with in the Metro network,that means any number of changes can be covered by a single ticket only. But a word of caution! If you have some luggages with you then be prepared for a good weight lifting workout!!! Quite a few of the Metro stations do not have any escalators or elevators! so the good old stairs have to be negotiated.(Pernety is one of them!) The location of this Hotel is 50meters away from the Pernety station in Metro line 13,which is definitely a big advantage. The Hotel is at least not a pretender! It is a 2star and it declares that,I liked that. Check- in procedure was smooth and fast. The Elevator of the Hotel is an antique, probably from the time of French Revolution!!! If you get in to it with your luggage, then the other person has to wait!!! They definitely need to change the lift as soon as possible. The room was small to say the least!!!. There was hardly any space to move with out banging each other! The toilet was even smaller. if anybody is over 6ft and around 90+kg,then please avoid this Hotel as you will not be able to enter the shower cubicle!!! In the positive side there is an Aircon and it works! Good water pressure and hot water. A lot of reviewer had complained about the low energy lamps,but we did not find them as an irritation! Sound proofing is bad and you can listen to all the conversation of the adjacent rooms. The noise from the road was audiable till mid night!!! But I guess in Paris one need not complain about small room and bath!!! Had I been there for my work I would take it but probably not when you are on a vacation with your family. Breakfast was served in the cellar. It was just OK. Nothing great about it,but the coffee was plentiful and good so was the fresh croissant. There are a lots of good restaurants in the vicinity. Couple of Bristos near the Metro station,and one excellent Chinese small food joint nearby. On the other side of the Hotel there is a very good Lebanese Restaurant. Prices are very reasonable in all the places. We really do not know in Paris how small are the other Hotel rooms but if they are as small as this place then this Hotel would score over a lot of places because of their location and helpful attitude.
