On the train to Rome during a trip with my husband and in-laws, my husband discovered that he had incorrectly booked our rooms and called the hotel to sort out the situation. The owner was extremely understanding and immediately tried to do what he could to accommodate us and ensured that we had enough rooms to stay for the duration of our trip. He shifted us to the hotel apartments for the last two days of our stay and these were one of the nicest ones I've stayed in plus they were extremely well priced. So I'd highly recommend checking out the Cortina apartments as well. The hotel itself is small but extremely well located, within walking distance to Termini station, Trevi fountain, the Spanish steps and other cultural highlights.

This place is my favorite as it really gives you everything easy. Via Nazionale is close to Termini, the main train station, but away from the somewhat gritty section immediately close to it. The walk to Hotel Cortina is about 7-10 minutes, located on one of the main downtown arteries. Immediate close to the place is lots of clothes shopping, the non- touristic shops, where the locals go, but yet in the heart of Rome, and only about a 15-20 minute walk to the main sites of the city ! The area is quite safe, and there is even an Irish Pub directy adjacent to the Hotel. I can not imagine a better location for a hotel ! The famous American travel writer Rick Steves, wrote up about this place and he has included it in his travel books. The staff is very friendly, I can tell you that in the 11 years that I have been coming here, most of the staff has not changed, I only see the same faces and this gives me a great sense of trust. Tip: I highly reccommend staying in their apratments (just around the corner), for the most value--check it out from their main website--. You get a spacious apartment in Rome for about the same price completely furnished and newly remodled which includes a kitchen, etc..It trully feels like your home in Rome ! Also, the hotels offers a car service to the airport that is one of the most resonable prices I've seen. Some useful info on transportation: we spent about 10 Euros on our trips back late at night, I find that very reaonable. The bus can be taken directly in front of the hotel or better yet the metro is located about 4 minutes away too. I reccomend walking the most though, it's a pleasure in Rome.

We were family with 2 teenage children and the family room sleeping 4 that they had was ideal for us.

It is also in walking distance of the Colosseum/Pantheon/Trevi Fountain although we only once walked back as a holiday in Rome involves a lot of walking (and queuing if you don't prebook on the internet which is essential for the Colosseum and Vatican).The hotel doesn't look much from the outside but once you get through the outside door and up the stairs, it is very nice and great value for money. Breakfast is buffet style/help yourself and the room was fine - you don't really want to eat in your hotel in Rome as there are so many great restaurants to try. We particularly liked Gusto and also the Pizzeria da Ricci - the latter is just down the road from the hotel in Via Genova (right at the end in the corner - watch you don't miss it) and sells really good pizzas and also draught Peroni in litre glasses ! Should also mention that the owner of the hotel was extremely helpful and spoke English perfectly - the Colosseum was closed due to flooding on the day that we had tickets but he phoned and sorted it out so that we were able to go back and use our tickets the next day when it had reopened. We had a great time in Rome which is a superb place to go for a long weekend as there is so much to see - and this hotel is the place to stay if you don't want to spend a fortune but want to stay somewhere central.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troy, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Maria G", "ReviewID": "UR119373152", "Content": "Just recently got back from a trip to Europe.

As a first time traveler to Italy (or Europe for that matter) I didn't know what to expect. Many friends warned me to lower my expectations of what I am used to in America (specifically California) but I didn't want to do that. So I researched until I found a place that seemed comparable without breaking our budget. Here are my pros and cons: PROS: CAR SERVICE pick up from the airport: very friendly/helpful driver who drove us to the bank to get Euros before anything else. He gave us a brief \"tour\" of the sites we passed STAFF: Very friendly and always seemed more than willing to help us make our stay more pleasurable. They gave us a map and told us how long to expect each walk to take and recommended good places to eat. We were also able to use and \"internet key\" to send emails to our young kids so they wouldn't miss us too badly. LOCATION: AWESOME. We walked EVERYWHERE and took short cab rides back at night (only bc I was too tired from walking since I woke up). There is a Metro station a couple of blocks down that we used to get to Vatican City. There is a grocery store a couple of blocks down as well and several locally owned shops lined the street for those who simply must shop while on vacation BREAKFAST: AWESOME, the breakfast room is quaintly decorated with linen table cloths and serves fresh pastries, rolls, juices, cheese, meats, yogurts, etc. I had (2 or 3) freshly made cappuccino every morning by a nice woman w/a very warm smile. BED: Was firm just the way we like it and we slept very well each night. CONS: KEY: You have to turn in your room key before you leave and get it back when you return. I'm just not used to this but everything seemed to be in place when we returned, I even left my laptop in the room and it was untouched. ROOM: I'm not going to lie, it was a little bit small but we weren't tripping over each other. It served it's purpose (to hold our luggage and give us a place to crash at night) and was quaintly decorated. BATHROOM: The water temp did fluctuate while showering but only for brief seconds so it wasn't that big of a deal to me at all. The hair dryer was quite old and seemed to over heat while drying my very long and thick hair but it wasn't that big of a deal to me.

We stayed at this Hotel last night based on the rating by Others on Trip Advisor. We originally booked 2 nights but decided to leave after the first night. We were put in Room 11 so the comments here pertain to that room. In short, you would need a pygamy cat to be able to swing it in this room. I've included photos as proof. Two people could not walk around the room. I spent the stay climbing over the bed to get out the door. There was a window that faced onto an internal alcove that was used by the housekeeping staff. There was, as a result, no natural light so we had to leave the light on to see where we were going to trip over. There were no spare power points to charge phones, etc. When I switched off the main light the switch cover fell off the wall. Now the bathroom, or more appropriate, the bathroom closet ! The ancient hairdryer cord fell out of the handle as soon as i touched it. The shower tiles had mould ingrained. There was no soap holder in the shower (probably because you couldnt fit one in it). The water pressure was non existent and just warm enough not to to be cold. Considering the positive comments, all we can say in that if you are given the key to room 11 .. run for your life !!!! We had just spent 5 weeks in Europe and stayed at fantastic three/four star hotels that we could not fault. We stayed a week at Sorrento in Hotel Minerva and had a huge room that over looked the Bay of Naples - at the same daily rate we paid for the hotel Cortina.

The restaurants that we tried were all good. There is an internet cafe around the corner and many of the main historical sights are just a few minute walk away. We opted to have the hotel provide us with round trip transport from the airport. The cost was $55.00 to the hotel and $50.00 back to the airport. This was ore expensive than a cab but it felt great to get our bags, walk through customs and have someone waiting for us. The only downside was the Irish Pub next door had a DJ one night.

Breakfast is served at the hotel, which is about 25m around the corner (and very convenient, despite what other reviewers might have written). Best of all, the location is in the heart of the best part of Rome, with a number of lovely restaurants nearby, and the major train station for Rome only a 10 minute stroll up the road. We caught the train to Naples, and it was an easy walk even with luggage and children in tow. The main stop for the open top bus services is only a 5 minute walk away, and was our main means of transport for all our Roman sightseeing. There is also a supermarket 50m down the road, which allowed us to do a bit of self catering to suit the specific tastes of our kids, as well as stock up on local Chianti! We had a family (quadruple) room for one night on the way out, which had a queen and two single bed, which was adequate for us. After having stayed in the apartment the quad room was a little cramped, but it was certainly well maintained, clean and suitable. Both mangers were perfect gentlemen, who greeted us with a smile every time we saw them, and made us feel very much at ease and comfortable.

While searching for suitable accommodation for my family of 2 adults and 2 teen girls, I came across the Hotel Cortina website. We specifically wanted 2bathrooms and 2 bedrooms and I found the perfect solution in the apartments owned and managed by the Hotel Cortina. Basically, the apartments are situated a few doors away down a side lane from the main hotel so its quiet at night if you keep the windows closed. There are 3 apartments in that building managed by the hotel. Apartment A which we had that sleeps 4. Apartment B that can sleep up to 3 with one person utilising the sofa bed and another bigger apartment that can sleep up to 5. All the apartments are done up in a modern style and unlike the smaller hotel rooms, the apartment has lots of space. The apartment complex also has a small lift so you don't need to climb the stairs, especially with luggage when you check in or check out. You enter the apartment to see a big living and dining area. There is a big flat screen tv and DVD player. Then you walk through to see a full sized kitchen fully equipped with a full sized stove, refrigerator and the necessary condiments like oil, salt,pepper and even other spices to make a quick meal. There is a smaller table and 4chairs in the kitchen as well. Situated on either end of the kitchen are the two bedrooms. The master bedroom with its own ensuite has a bathtub, sink and toilet plus a bidet. The master bedroom has a king size bed and a full sized wardrobe. The other bedroom has two twin beds and and also its own ensuite with a sink, bidet, toilet and a shower. There is a small safe in the closet just outside the twin bedroom. The apartment is centrally heated throughout and a plus which we found is that both bedrooms and the living room has its own airconditioning unit which we found useful when we experienced 2 warmer afternoons while in Rome. Emailed the hotel directly to book and Angelo was very nice. He gave me a small discount off the rates which was very reasonable for such a big apartment. Our rates also include buffet breakfasts which we had at the hotel building. Unlimited amount of coffee/tea/hot chocalate, pastries, cold cuts and yoghurt and fruits which kept us full till our late lunch at 3pm on two days when we had tours in the mornings. We found the location on Via Nationale near Termini Station convenient for transportation and food. A few grocery shops and supermarkets within walking distance and this area near the train station is quite safe. We had no problems walking around the area at night. There are several consulates situated along this street and we found policemen on petrol everywhere. I find that Rome is quite safe generally. Just take the necessary precautions, don't wear flashy jewellery and don't carry large amount of money about. We enjoyed our trip very much.

Everything I wanted without paying four star prices. When you arrive, there's an elevator to get you to the first floor hotel. (In Europe the first floor is the floor above the lobby.) Don't take this for granted. In Rome, many of the hotels are on upper floors of larger buildings and they don't always have elevators. The room was bigger than others I have stayed in in Europe, but note that doesn't mean it was as big as a standard American hotel room. There were heavy blackout shades that enabled us to sleep whenever we wanted to, which is a bonus when you are working through your jet lag. The bed was comfortable and there were extra pillows and blankets. The room had its own individually controlled air conditioner for no extra charge (again, don't assume this will always be the case in Rome hotels). The bathroom was reasonably large and attractive, with a stand-up shower (no tub) and a hair dryer. The front desk staff was nice and helpful with directions and information. They even served us breakfast our first day at noon, even though breakfast hours ended at 10:00. The only quirky things about the place were occassional bursts of cold water in the shower and that the hair dryer would get very hot when you used it for long. Not big complaints in my book. The location of Hotel Cortina is great. We walked there from Termini train station and had no problem finding it. But it is a bit of a long walk. You can also take the Metro one stop from Termini to the Republica station and then you are only about three blocks from the hotel. Being three blocks from the Metro is handy in general. That Metro is the line (Line A) that takes you to the Vatican/St. Peters and the Spanish Steps. We walked just about everywhere except the Vatican. It's about 10-15 minutes walk to the Colluseum/Forum area, and about 15 minutes walk to Trevi Founctain or the Spanish Steps. Also, there is an Internet cafe around the corner from the hotel and a grocery store about a block and a half away. Note that there is no Internet in the hotel. I asked for a quiet room and we were facing the courtyard out back. No view, but nice and quiet. We were in Rome the night before the European Cup championship (soccer/football) and the Irish pub downstairs was crazy. We had fun going down to watch the signing and shouting, but couldn't hear it at all up in our room. I'm not sure if that was the case in other rooms that night.

The apartment is about 100 feet from the hotel. Newly renovated, clean, stylish, and comfortable are the words to describe the wonderful one-bedroom apartment (the apartment was called the \"Milano\"). The apartment had an efficiency kitchen that includes a two-burner smooth-top range, a small fridge, microwave, and all plates, glassware and utensils. The apartment was on the second floor, serviced by an elevator (lift). The rate for the apartment was a great value with a flat weekly rate. The hotel offers linen service every third day in the apartments. We saved money by having a couple of meals in our apartment with food we bought at the grocery store about one minute walk away. The apartment had satellite TV with CNN, BBC, and SkyNews in English on a wall-mounted flat-screen. The apartment did not offer internet service, however, there is a public internet kiosk next door to the apartment entry offering 30 minutes of access for 1.50 Euro. The bathroom was fully-stocked with amenities, the towels were nice and thick, and the towel-warmer was a nice feature. Never had any problems with availability of hot water. Angelo and his staff were helpful and gracious. In addition, Angelo gave some great recommendations with regard to restaurants, money changing services, and shops in the area. The location was convenient to dining, shopping, and transportation. Everything we needed was within easy walking distance. Less than five minute walk to the main \"Termini\" train and bus station. The breakfast was good. It provided what you would expect at most European hotels with rolls, cereal, pastries, cheese, sliced deli meats, juice, coffee, and tea. The entrance to the hotel itself looks a bit shop worn, but, don't let the entrance lower your first impression of the hotel. Buildings in Rome are very old, so this is a feature of many properties. We chose to have the hotel set up our transportation to and from the airport. It may have cost a few Euro more, but, it was efficient and hassle free. The driver was waiting for us with a sign that said \"Hotel Cortina\" and our last name. If you stay here, you should be pleased with the choice. Angelo, thanks for a great stay.

By the looks of the front of the building and door, we didn't know what we were getting into when we had to buzz to get in and barely fit in the elevator with our luggage. But, that all was erased when we walked into the hotel, where the man who checked us in was wonderful!! Before we could ask the questions, he had a map out, telling us where we could eat dinner and where we could walk that day. He was the nicest man that we had ever met while checking into the hotel. Everything else was OK. The blankets on the bed grossed me out so I slept with a sheet. The mini-fridge was great because we could store our on water and wine there. The breakfast was OK. Corn-flakes and rice-krispes, bread, some sweet breads, cheese and yogurt. No hot food. We thought the location was fine. We love to walk everywhere! From the hotel, we could walk to the Spanish steps in about 10 minutes, we walked to the forum in about 15 minutes, although we took the metro to Vatican City, we walked back to our hotel taking in more of Rome! Luckily, the windows in our room sealed. We tried leaving the window open for fresh air one evening while we got ready for dinner and we couldn't hear each other without shouting. That was a bit annoying, but those are the breaks when staying on a busy street. But, like I said, the windows kept the sound out great when they were closed!!! Although it was a pleasant stay, I don't think we would stay there again. Also, I may recommend it to some of our younger siblings (early 20s) who are traveling through Europe, but we wouldn't tell most of our friends (early 30s) or our parents to stay there.", "Date": "November 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne visiting europe", "Title": "\u201cperfect\u201d", "Author": "iloveeuropetoomuch", "ReviewID": "UR6113158", "Content": "we were upgraded to the apartment which was amazing!! just around the corner from the hotel so the hotel is in a great spot. about 15 mins walk to coluseum and forum. breakfast was ok and staff very friendly. recommended.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHappy with our stay\u201d", "Author": "krissypoo", "ReviewID": "UR6083864", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Cortina for 6 nights and we were very happy with our stay.

They lent us Rome tour guides, provided maps, and were knowledgeable about the local bus & train system. We liked having breakfast available everyday, too - there were various options and anyone could find something that they like. The room was spotless. Our bathroom was modern and large w/a full tub & shower. The location might be a little too close to Termini for people who would prefer to have all the sights at their fingertips. However, that type of location in Rome comes with a steep pricetag, so if you don't mind to walk for a few minutes, the location is just fine. The buzzer system to get into the building worked our pefectly. We would recommend the Hotel Cortina to those looking for a reasonably-priced clean and comfortable hotel within walking distance to the sights.

They also arranged a return private transfer from Ciampino airport (at Euro55 each way). Apartment on 4th floor, just round the corner from the busy Via Nazionale. Found it to be spacious, well furnished/decorated and quiet, away from traffic noise. Air-con a bonus! Beds really comfortable too!! Found everywhere in Rome easy enough to walk to, with the help of a good map, with the exception of the Vatican which we got a bus to (Termini station close by) - the hotel will advise you of which bus. Just wear comfortable shoes for the uneven pavements and cobblestones. Went at the end of August, found some places to be closed but most were re-opening (August is shut-down/holiday season). Lunch was often a panini, which we all enjoyed, but evening meals were more hit-and-miss - rarely were all our meals served together and quality wasn't always what we expected. On the downside, my purse was snatched on our last day while shopping on Via Cavour where it was really busy. Noticed that, in a split second, someone had unzipped my bag (which was in front of me!) and pulled out my purse! I'm always really careful so felt very shocked and saddened to have this happen.
