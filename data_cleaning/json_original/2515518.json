It's a well-priced alternative to the usual expensive San Diego hotels, and extremely well located in the heart of Little Italy - walking distance to almost everything except Old Town. About 15-20min to Horton Plaza and Gastown, good 20-30 min (uphill) to Balboa Park, easy 10min to the waterfront, and then along towards the Midway Museum, ferry to Coronado, etc. Little Italy itself has lots of restaurants, and a cute Saturday morning mercado (market) right ouside the doors of the hotel. There is definitely a \"high-end dorm\" feeling to this hotel compared to more expensive hotels, but far and above staying at a hostel etc. A warning - the rooms really are TINY, but that is the trade-off for the price. Also I think some of the rooms might be better in terms of size and view than others - I unfortunately got a room with a window facing a very near wall of the next building, but I couldn't be bothered to ask for a change since I was out-and-about exploring the city all day and really only in the room at night. Rooms are simple, but nicely updated and modern, the beds very comfortable, fridge in room, and for the price compared to other San Diego hotels, this is really a good deal if you're on a budget and don't require luxury but don't want to go too cheap either. The rooms were clean, but I did notice that some non-main areas had a good layer of dust (TV, top of head-board, top of clothing shelf, etc) and my bathtub wasn't really cleaned well each day, oh well. It was also quite late in the day before rooms got cleaned, sometimes I'd be out from 9am-2pm and the room still had to be done. No alarm clock and no coffee makers in the rooms. The coffee shop downstairs though was really good (Cafe Italia).

The biggest negative I experienced all weekend was that I could not get wireless. I was told to hook into the Cafe's wireless but the signal was too weak. The front desk gave me the password, which I think they assumed I already had, but it didn't work, even after a second call down to confirm that I had it right. But, you know, they would have solved it if I had pursued it (I had my iPhone so I didn't) because they were just nice like that. Okay. Phew. Glad that's over. Now let's move on to the really good things about this hotel. This was the perfect choice for a quick weekend getaway to catch the Pacific Standard Time shows at the MCASDs. I reserved an \"Argento Single\". Too small. No place to even hang clothes. I ran back down to the front desk, asking for a bigger room. For a slight price increase, Room 320 is a larger (I didn't say LARGE) corner room with a balcony overlooking the hub of Little Italy. A place to hang clothes, a desk, mini-fridge and windows on two sides. Perfect...for one person (or two who really like each other). I did see, through an open door, a much bigger room so they do exist. But Room 320 was perfect for me. The room was very clean, chic decor (recently redone), comfy bed. It's not a luxury hotel. The amenities were few; shampoo (no conditioner), soap (no lotion), a hairdryer. I didn't see a clock in my room but who wants a clock when you are on vacation? Beyond the room, the hotel is charming. Great front desk staff, helpful housekeeping, a mascot terrier, low-key attitude and peaceful. The four or five-block Little Italy Farmer's Market on Saturday is right outside the hotel and the great band that was set up on the corner opposite my room made a nice Saturday even more enjoyable. Somehow attached to the hotel is Cafe Italia which is where my mornings began (also great sandwiches for lunch). The street is loaded with restaurants and bars (this is where central location of your hotel might come in handy), a couple of nearby convenience stores plus walking distance to many other points of interest.

I was in San Diego to attend a conference and needed an Internet connection for work. Some how, I ended up in a hotel without in-room connection, so after the first night I hunted around for a room. There were not a lot of choices under $200 night (my budget), but I found La Pensione. Just to be sure of the hotel and its service, I went to the hotel before making the reservation. I spoke with a woman at the front desk and confirmed the in-room Internet service, which is also advertised on their site. Given the great location and relatively okay look and feel of the modest hotel, I made a reservation. When I showed up to move in, I again confirmed the Internet connection. That first night, after my conference, I tried to log on. No luck. The person at the front desk \"rebooted the system\", but still no connection. I had to send out several lengthy emails thru my cell phone. The next night, the same thing. I was very disappointed and would have understood were they to tell me that the system was down, but they could not have been less interested in the issue. That night, I approached the manager, Javier,at the front desk. He said that the Internet didn't work as well in some rooms of the hotel. I told him that I had expressed my need for the Internet very clearly on more than one occasion. He then said something about it being Comcast's problem. I requested a price reduction, given that I had paid their walk-in rate of $129 for a very (underscore very) modest room and expected Internet to be included in that charge. A very modest $10/day would have shown me that he cared about the inconvenience, but he said he'd have to check with someone who was traveling. This morning, I woke up and went to check out. The woman who had originally told me that the rooms had Internet was at the front desk. I told her about the conversation with the manager last night and asked if they final bill reflected a rebate. It did not, and she had not heard anything about it. She would have to try to get a hold of the manager, Javier. I left my suitcase there and went off to my conference. I returned at noon to retrieve my suitcase and settle the bill. The woman said that Javier denied any kind of reduction. When I asked her if she thought this seemed wrong, given that she, herself, had \"sold\" me on the Internet service, she replied, \"I dunno\". Anyway, it's left me VERY upset.

The building itself is attractive, and the inner courtyard and lobby give it the look of a high-end boutique hotel, not the budget hotel it is. There were, unfortunately, a number of downsides. First, the rooms were very small. We were coming from New York and are used to small rooms, but our room was claustrophobic even for us. In addition, we were on the second floor with a window facing India Street, so there was significant street noise, although it was not unbearable (then again, we have a high tolerance for that sort of thing). More annoyingly, sound-wise, was the old plumbing. Every time the room above us flushed their toilet, it was extremely loud in our room, to the point that it woke me up several times. Finally, the shower was pretty pathetic, a tepid stream with almost no pressure, along with cheap soap and shampoo and old thin towels. In summary, this hotel presents an attractive face, but it doesn\u2019t follow through on the rooms.

My sister stayed in a room around the corner of the building and her room was at least 10 degrees warmer than mine. So if you are concerned about the heat, try and get a room with some breezes. One other thing to note about the location: the hotel is a couple of blocks from the train station and the night trains are very noisy. Apparently the engineers blow their horns to clear the tracks of sleeping people. While it is a beautiful and haunting sound, if you are a light sleeper, consider another part of town.

I am sure some of the complaints are founded, as not everything will be perfect for $75/night. For example: 1) Chain lock on our door was busted (We didn't care, still had deadbolt) 2) Elevator made some funny noises (The liscense expired while we were there, again didn't really care) These issues didn't bother me enough to talk to the front desk, so I can't comment on how they deal with this kind of thing if it really bothered somebody. The location in little italy truly is fantastic. If I was staying in San Diego again, I would not hesitate to book here unless the temperature was going to be hot, as there is no AC, and I could see this being a possible issue if the temperatures were in the 80s or above.

Taking a chance, we were given the key to Room #223 - a corner room overlooking India Street. It's one of their larger rooms, but was only $75 a night! Quite a bargain for the location - at night India Street is romantic & beautiful with white lights strung throughout the trees that line it & a large sign in blue neon arches across it. It's within walking distance of Broadway for the Spreckles Theatre & some great dining (when you're NOT feeling like Italian, of course!) The free undergrround parking was nice, but VERY - VERY TIGHT!! Your best bet--rent the smallest car possible & you shouldn't have too much trouble. However, it did lead to some comedic moments, so it was worth it! We were set to leave one day, checked out, got the airport & realized how much we wanted to stay, so we drove back to La Pensione to re-check in! Unfortunately they were doing maintenance on the room already, so we got another one---this time on the 4th floor - #419 I think?

Apparently at the time there were only a few of those. NO, we had a full size bed to share between the 2 of us. Plus, it was HOT - not when you want to be forced to cuddle in a small bed. Like everyone else who has complained here, we had to have the ceiling fan on and the window open all night. Now unlike air conditioning where the temp is constant, the breeze can give you the chills... so we also fought over the tiny sheet all night. In addition to being kept up by the noise of the trolley/train that is a block away all night long... the little sleep we had was disturbed by the garbage truck at 5:30 in the morning emptying the dumpster under our window on (get this) the Fourth of July! Who knew they worked holidays. Needless to say we checked out the next morning and happily paid 4x the rate for a quite nice hotel elsewhere.

Overall, we had a good experience but there are a couple of things that I think are important to share: - Parking was an issue for us. The free garage underneath the building was almost always full (except during the day on weekdays). The parking spots are quite narrow and as a whole the garage is very tight. Our rental car was a fairly big Buick Century and that didn't help much - a compact car would do better here. Street parking so close to Little Italy was tough sometimes - spots are few and far between and are often restricted (limited parking duration during the days, and one day of the week off-limits for street cleaning). We had supper one night at a restaurant and marveled at how it only took 20 seconds to fill an empty spot in front of us. - We are both fairly sound sleepers, so noise wasn't generally an issue for us. We had a north-facing room (417). Noise from planes/trains/trucks was present a lot of the time. The pillows could have been better too. - The shower wasn't comfortable - it varied too much from too hot/too cold. As a whole, the room itself didn't get especially hot. Other than that, what can I say? It is really good value in a relatively expensive tourist destination like San Diego. The room was quite clean and the in-room mini fridge was helpful to us. The dog in the lobby is friendly and the hotel has great access to freeways. La Pensione has a lot going for it, and I would recommend it to people who are looking for a decent budget hotel. ps.

The trouble with La Pensione is that it *looks* great, it really does. Decor is great, twinkly fairy lights on the outside at night, really extraordinary mural on the inner courtyard wall... sounds great. Enough to sell it, anyhow. The lack of air conditioning didn't even bother me much, even it was slightly sweltering in July, the ceiling fan noise wasn't so bad. They weren't so efficient, either, though, and the minute you pull back the funky purple curtains to open the window... the noise hits you. Front facing rooms are on a crossroads, across the street is a tacky 'English Pub' with outside tables and lots of noise over weekend nights. There's lots of light right outside the window, its near the rail tracks and airport and there's lots of foot and vehicle traffic that got really bad on the Friday/Saturday nights - not fabulous if you want to crash and get a good nights sleep... What really bugged me was that, booking several months in advance, we didn't realise that each room only has a single queen size bed. (I don't recall seeing it on their website at the time, and it would have been a factor in choosing a hotel - I note that they do make a point of it now on the website.) This wasn't the case at any of the dozens of other places we stayed at, and it really wasn't big enough if you need a twin room. If we had realised, we would have booked 2 rooms and been done with it - of course, that wasn't an option when a convention had just descended on town, so we were stuck for the next 5 days. We weren't the only people caught out by this - there were at least 2 others in the queue ahead of me with the same problem when I went to bug the receptionist about it. What annoyed me more was her attitude - it was quite obvious that she would rather have been getting back to the dinner she was apparently eating behind the desk at the time!! None of the staff were particularly friendly or helpful (except the bellhop who fetched us blankets!) and you generally got the impression they would rather the guests weren't there intruding on their precious hotel. God forbid you should want an apology for anything, cos you're not going to get it! I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been so bad if we'd had another room, or hadn't been stuck there for quite so long. Little Italy is pretty and quaint, but the Gaslamp Quarter and Convention Centre is a good 15 minute walk away and it's probably worth spending a bit more and getting a bit nearer if you're conventioning...
