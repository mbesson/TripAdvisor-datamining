(yet we are a young couple so it was not a big deal.)-there was no phone or clock (so we could not do a wake up call or set an alarm). -the bed was rock hard, which we never got use to in our 3 night stay.-the smell that other reviewers were talking about did exist when we walked into the building but it was not present in our rooms thank goodness.-the light/window fixtures in the room looked like they were about to fall off, and one actually was off already.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR647335135", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jv_blues"}, {"Content": "Split Decision Great and Avg The location is superb.

Bath was across the hall from our room and smelled a little musty but facilities were clean and you couldn't beat this location.", "Date": "Oct 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR718889124", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ijan"}, {"Content": "Website is very misleading I just got back from a trip to Italy and I want to warn any travelers who might be considering the Hotel Bretagna in Florence. I studied in Italy and travel there frequently. I have an Italian friend who owns a BB and I assured him that I could make the hotel reservations for Florence because I know the city well. I found the Hotel Bretagna's website and thought I had found a gem. It is right along the Arno and the photos were beautiful. I booked a double room and asked many questions. I know what to expect from Italian hotels and I know that they are very different than a Holiday Inn. I did not have unrealistic expectations.When we arrived I was horrified at the condition of the entrance and reception area. It was filthy and very run-down. I didn't know what to think, I decided to see the room before complaining. The room was also filthy. The bathroom was dirty and the room was extremely shabby. It was like a flea-bag hotel you would find near the train station. The bed linens were threadbear, musty and visibly dirty.I was embarrassed that I had chosen so poorly, especially since my friend is the proprietor of a BB. We complained about how dirty and run-down everything was and I said I wouldn't stay. Luckily, I found an alternate hotel that was fine but the Bretagna still charged my credit card for one night's stay.I am not a picky traveler. I travel on a budget all the time, I usually opt for a shared bathroom just to share a few dollars. But this place was terrible and compared to the way it was presented on the website, it was inexcusable. My Italian friend summed it up when he told the front desk My compliments to the photographer!I'd hate to see someone be as disappointed as we were. I thought we would have a beautiful, tranquil and romantic stay and we wasted half a day just getting relocated. If I didn't know Florence so well, we might have had to stay there and I actually thought they might have bed-bugs. I wouldn't advise this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "Sep 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR108307279", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "camiller"}, {"Content": "Good Location, Bathroom Stank The location is excellent, right on the Arno River with great views of Florence. Just a few blocks from the Uffuzi Gallery and main center. Didn't get the best impression upon check-in. It was about 11 pm, and they had all the lights off in the main lobby. Then, when we got to our room, 2 light bulbs were out, and they didn't have replacements (it worked out though, because we found the other light switches for the remaining lights). The good thing is that there is a large (new) sink in your room, that cuts your reliance on the communal restroom. The restroom (shower, toilet) is down the hall, and really stinks - an unfresh odor, you can't put your finger on. I suppose you can adapt to it during a quick shower. At one point, there wasn't enough toilet paper... Also, when you flushed the toilet, water bubbles up from the sink - just go to your room and wash your hands. The breakfast (included) was good though - table service they serve you fresh cafe, bread and juice. I loved the nutella packets to go with the bread - yum! It's true like their website says, the dining room looks out on the river and has spectacular views.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR785631067", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "suluu"}, {"Content": "such a great place   showReview(4346640, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR790336692", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Hated every minute   showReview(4328300, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR210533743", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SeattleERnurse"}, {"Content": "Only for the hardy traveller   showReview(4136458, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR476491340", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Average   showReview(4131211, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR180320041", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "atrium"}, {"Content": "Dirty, unfriendly dump   showReview(4078080, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR769039019", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "flomac"}, {"Content": "The worse hotel I have ever stayed at!   showReview(4070627, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR331561397", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sdjSeattle_WA"}, {"Content": "Modest hotel in a great location   showReview(2581770, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR419491247", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Section204"}, {"Content": "Bellissimo week-end   showReview(22786493, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR958823640", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Sagitta"}, {"Content": "Las instalaciones del hotel son...   showReview(22599830, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR217029079", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'emplacement est parfait pour...   showReview(21766821, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR967012428", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "malo   showReview(20746154, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR281234429", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "iturhiria"}, {"Content": "Preciosa ubicacion frente el...   showReview(20890488, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR319342055", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ho appena mandato una coppia di...   showReview(19868730, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR533255100", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Excelente ubicaci\u8d38n.
