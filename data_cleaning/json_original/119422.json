We got a Standard room and were surprised by the roominess of it, great size room, huge bathroom area, comfortable beds, rooms made up daily and most importantly (for tourists anyway), GREAT location, it's literally a few minutes walk to Hollywood Boulevard and transport. Although we didn't spend all day in the hotel, we both had a pleasant nights sleep each night. So if you're looking for somewhere comfortable to stay and base yourself from while you see the sights, without breaking the bank, I would recommend this place. Of course there were some things that could be improved, front desk staff always seemed too busy chatting on the phone or with friends to care too much; despite this though, they will help you with what you need if you ask for it! The rooms look a little dated, and could do with some minor maintenance, but nothing major. Overall, great value for money, with free wifi (ask front desk for pass key) and parking.

This hotel is not compliant in many ways, so if you need an elevator, forget it! Lots of steps. THe front desk attendents can be very helpful and for the most part polite. The woman who owns the place was there when I checked in and she told me the building was built in the 1930s. She was very nice as well.

Argh!) and we were checked into our ground floor room fast and efficiently. There were two double beds in the main room, with a chest of drawers containing a TV with lots of cable channels and there was a large table in the corner. No door to the bathroom but this never caused a problem the whole week we were there so don't let this startle you. The toilet did have a door and was at one end of the bathroom and the shower was large, and was very easy to use, it was great. The reception staff were always friendly and didn't mind looking after our passports the whole week (recommended) . The room was cleaned and beds made daily and towels were changed every other day and the maids were very friendly and even washed a towel for me i brought from home without me asking. Nothing went missing from our room at any point in the week. The room was basic, but this hotel is all about the location, its a 1-2 min walk from the main blvd which has the Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame. and a 3 min walk from the underground metro station which will get you everywhere you want to go for a very great price. Lots of great restaurants in the area including The Rolling Stone lounge, Hard Rock Cafe, California Pizza Kitchen, Boho (who do an AMAZING steak) and Hollywood Grill. Lots of other places to eat along hollywood blvd. All in all I highly recommend this hotel, the bad reviews must have been unlucky?

Last time, we had a room on the second floor, was nice and quiet, room cleaning was great, and the hotel was in a great location. This time, while the location is still great, we had barely any water pressure when trying to take a shower (it would just trickle out of the shower head), the sink hot water barely ran, and there were silverfish in various places in the room (yuck.) We got the \"Liberty Suite\" or \"Junior Suite\" as they called it, which came with a little kitchenette which was roomy, but it consisted of a fridge that never felt cold, but some how made all your beverages turn to ice regardless of its temperature setting, and a microwave from the early 70s that we did not dare use. Our room was missing a hair dryer, and when we asked the staff, they tried to take one from another room, but couldn't find any that weren't attached to the walls. The girl at the front desk spoke in a heavy Russian accent, and acted like she was stoned out of her mind when trying to deal with the hair dryer issue. There was an ironing board but no Iron, and I didn't even attempt to resolve that one. Our room was on the first floor and it was noisy all throughout the night. As people came and went, you could hear their footsteps and every word they said, the door lock worked but felt like it could be kicked in without much effort. We felt dirty the entire time we stayed there, and the lack of water pressure in the shower didn't help alleviate that at all. The 'continental breakfast' is tucked away in a side room every morning, and it's what you'd expect from a hotel like this: one jug of milk for all visitors, one jug of OJ, some half-empty cereal containers, and a few slices of bread / pastries that the manager bought from the corner store. There are no tea or coffee pots in room, and during this breakfast they put out one container of coffee, one container of hot water (for tea, but no tea bags....) and one container of decaf. Even though the location is GREAT (right behind hollywood/highland, and beside the Renaissance), I won't be staying here again. Last year we stayed at the Renaissance and every time we walked by it, we wished we were in there again instead of Hotel Liberty. We had the maids service the room on our second day and all they did was make the bed and give us new towels. We didn't make any mess, but the sheets were not changed... they simply made the bed. Eventually we just left the privacy please sign up since we didn't want to risk the maids leaving the door open to our room and walking away much like they did the other rooms we saw. We would leave for the morning the door to a few rooms would be wide open with no hotel staff in sight. The rooms were not vacant, either.

This is an OSHA violation. Next we'll mention that the electrical outlet directly behind the bed, was an uncovered outlet, pressed firmly against the fabric of the bed, in which a small spark could then ignite the bed. This was in room 211. I was then told I would be moved to room 111, but the persons in that room had not checked out in time, so I was offered room 102, which is right in the lobby area. This room looked as if they had just thrown the bed in there last second, as there was no bedskirt on the bed, giving a very tacky & unprofessional appearance. In addition, this room had no refrigerator like the previous one, & therefore I was unable to put my leftover food, anywhere for the night, & was forced to throw it away. In an odd occurrence, there was a bit of a cold front that night, & the temperatures dropped. The heater in my room did NOT work, and the desk clerk said they could not fix it until the next morning. He did, however, find me a space heater, which took nearly an hour, to heat up. Having a room in the lobby was difficult enough to try and sleep, with all the traffic coming in & out of the hotel, but freezing was not helping either. The next morning as I attempted to get ready for my day, I realized the iron in my room did not work, so I had to take the iron to the front desk, and ask for a new one, which appeared to irritate the desk clerk, who was trying to watch TV in the lobby. After about 10-15 minutes of waiting, I finally received another iron. I then started my shower, realizing that I had no hot water. Now I had to put clothes back on, go to the lobby, \"disturb\" the desk clerk again, to ask why I had no hot water. He then came to check the water, and after several minutes of only cold coming out of the shower head, believed me. He then went to find the maintenance guy, who also needed to test the water before believing it to be true. Then the maintenance guy went to fix the water heater. 20-30 minutes later, I finally had hot water, and was now almost an hour behind on my important business day. As I was finally getting ready to leave, I asked the front desk to borrow a stapler, to which he had NO idea what I was saying. I pointed at it, & he handed me pliers. I then pointed again, & he realized what I was asking for. The stapler he handed to me did not work, and instead of handing me the OTHER stapler on the desk, which I'd seen him use earlier, the clerk then took his time trying to fix the stapler, then hunt down more staples to fill it. Finally, only an hour & fifteen minutes later than I'd planned on leaving, I was able to check out. Had I not been on such a time crunch for my trip, there would have been some serious words discussed with management, though I doubt they would have been able to understand any of it, as their English was minimal. I know Hollywood is not the glamorous place people think it is, but this place, especially for the price of nearly $100/night, was pathetic. I would NEVER recommend this trashy place to anyone, even someone I didn't like.

You can see the Hollywood sign from the Hollywood/Highland mall so make sure to snap some pictures there. Upon checking in, always examine the bed and sheets. I made a rather nasty discovery this time - there was a toenail in the sheets! I complained to the front desk and housekeeping came to change our sheets. The room was very spacious and there was a separate kitchenette and big bathroom. The decor is pretty dated (it's definitely a no frills hotel) and the room smelled strongly of bleach, and despite this the shower curtain was a bit mouldy. We attempted to air out the room and noticed that a few of the window latches were broken. Hotel maintenance has rectified this by welding bars on the outside over the broken windows so security wasn't too big an issue, and it was nice to be able to get some fresh air. The phone was not working so I had to make yet another complaint - however, this was fixed the next day. The hotel provides a decent free breakfast - you can have cereal, bagels, toast, muffins, juice, tea and coffee as you want. The staff were nice and were not offended by my complaints and did their best to fix any issues.

The staff are very friendly, helpful and accommodating, and we were actually charged less than we had been quoted. Be aware that they do not accept travellers cheques, altho the owner suggested I just pay the balance later in the week, once I'd cashed more cheques, so I wasn't leaving myself without any cash. The room itself was very clean, as was the bathroom. The location is ideal for Manns, the Walk of Fame, etc. We had mixed feelings about staying so close to Hollywood Blvd., as we had heard it can get pretty dodgy at night, but it wasn't so bad. The back entrance to the Liberty is right next to a very fancy hotel with doormen, so no chance of getting mugged on the (very short) walk home! The area might not be for everyone, it is very touristy, a bit run down and further down the boulevard is a bit dodgy, but it's certainly not as bad as some people say it is! It's weird to see such huge differences in people's opinions, not just of this place, but of any accommodation.
