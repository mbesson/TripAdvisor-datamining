The staff was extremely kind and welcoming, and the rooms were large and clean. We stayed in room 205 and the beds were comfy! (My sister stayed in 204, and the beds were creaky and OK at best). The pool was clean and never crowded, even on a holiday weekend. The Beachcomber was conveniently located to a number of restaurants within walking distance, as well as putt putt, and of course it was only a block from the beach, with no streets to cross.

Pros: *The place is \"hotel clean.\" *Rates are reasonable based on location and time of year. *There is parking is under the structure--this means the sun is not beating on your car all day. *Walking distance to the beach. *Hotel pool is small, but clean and well-maintained. *Ironing board, iron, frig, microwave, kitchenette available in our room. *Staff is friendly and helpful. *Garden hose near the entrance is available to wash beach sand off yourself. *Elevator is large and responsive. Cons: *Rooms face the main road (Coastal Hwy) instead of the ocean, which is partially obscured by other buildings closer to the ocean. *Traffic is loud unless the door to the balcony is closed. *No Internet access. (\"Go to McDonald's\") *Room key is an old school metal key with a plastic tag with the room number imprinted on it. *No room safe. *A/C filter cleaning/replacement is needed. A/C unit it loud. Wear noise plugs to bed. *If you're looking for privacy while you change in your room, the bathroom is the only place to do it, and it's really small. So if you're a big person... Other observations: *There are two handicap parking spaces. *Hotel pool's deep end is 5 feet. There is no diving board (which is a good thing in this case). *The exterior and the room interiors appear to have been recently painted--and painted properly. *There is at least one cart available to make the moving of luggage from your car to your room easier. *There is no fitness center. *There is no free breakfast or other similar amenities. *The ice machine is the ground floor.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "allentown", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT!\u201d", "Author": "ruthy918", "ReviewID": "UR137573358", "Content": "I was surprised to see so many good reviews on a motel that was so reasonably priced so I decided to try it out.

When I saw the price of this motel per night ($130-$150) I thought that it would be something comparable to what I get in the Jersey shore. I wasn't looking for anything fancy. This motel exceeded my expectations!! We arrived early in the morning, not expecting to check in until 3pm, the directed time. I went to the front desk upon my arrival which was 9am. The front desk staff is extremely friendly! They offered me a parking pass, completed my paperwork in a timely manner and explained that the room was not ready yet but they would call me as soon as it was available. We headed down to the beach which was within walking distance and relaxed on the beach for awhile. Front desk called around 1130am and said the room was ready. I was impressed with the service! The rooms were decent. Very spacious. We had a king size bed and a double bed, even though I only asked for a king. There was a private balcony and a very small area with a stove, sink and microwave. The room also has a large dresser and closet and a small dining table. The negatives, the beds were hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom could use some updating, I had to hold up the drain in the sink to let the water go down. The location was great. Right across the street from big peckers and bayside skillet (amazing crepes). Walking distance to Bj's on the bay. Within a few blocks of Seacrets. That was our main reason for our trip to OC and I was a little bummed that it was not as close as they had made it sound. Princess bayside is the hotel to stay in if you want to be within walking distance of Seacrets. If you are down for some sun, sand and drinks, great food and floating in the ocean this is a great place!! We had a blast and can't wait to return! Overall I recommend this motel.

This is our 3rd year staying at the Beachcomber. The motel is not only affordable and convenient to the beach, it is also clean, spacious, and comfortable. It is also in easy walking distance to a few other establishments of interest, if you just don't want the headache of driving in the traffic on Coastal Highway for the day. The owners, Tom and John Berry, are very courteous when making reservations and at check-in. Their friend, Dave, is also very helpful, when he fills in for them. They always ask if there's anything we need and if we're having a nice time. They don't hesitate in giving us advice on where to dine and shop, if asked. We know the rules of the motel and abide by them. The pool is for the guests of the Beachcomber; not for everyone elses' guests. The pool is clean and spotless for their paying customers; not for your friends staying at other hotels and motels. If you have a complaint as to why your friends can't use the pool, use theirs instead! While we were there, two young girls walked right from the beach to use the pool. John asked them if they were staying at the Beachcomber, (he suspected that they weren't.) They acted dumb and said, \"Huh?\" John asked them what room they were staying in, and the one girl looked at the other and said, \"He wants to know what room we're staying in,\" as if the other girl didn't understand English. The friend said nothing, then they turned and walked away. That's beacause they weren't staying at the Beachcomber and tried to lie their way to the pool. They just wanted to cleanse themselves of sand in the Beachcomber pool and leave. Now how ignorant is that?? It makes you wonder what kind of parents they have? Although the bathrooms are a bit small, they serve their purpose and are always very clean!! They have new shower curtains which are nice because they let in more light when showering. They used to have towel bars in the bathrooms, but because some parents don't know how to teach their children to respect other people's property, the towel bars were pulled out of the walls by those unruly children!! Even though the Beachcomber faces Coastal Highway, there is an ocean VIEW from the upper floors off the elevator. AND YES, THEY HAVE AN ELEVATOR, WHICH IS GREAT!!!! The cleaning staff is very friendly and accommodating, as well. Whatever you need, they will supply it for you every morning on their cleaning rounds. There is enough parking spots for registered guests, only!! So if you lie to the Berry's when making your reservations and they evict you for not abiding by their rules, then that's no one's fault but your own. And trust me, no one will miss you or care if you go and lie to others, somewhere else! The Berry's are doing their job and trying to make their motel comfortable for their REGISTERED guests. If that's not good enough for you trouble-makers, liars, and complainers, take a hike!!!!!!! We will continue to stay at the Beachcomber each year. We love the place!!

It's not the most recent decorating theme - but servicable since we had 5 people in the room (2 adults, 3 kids) and needed beds to accommodate us all.

But gentleman who checked us in told us he was not actually a member of the staff. He was just helping out. On day two we invited my daughter (whose family was staying at a condo one block away)and her three children to come to the pool for a swim. We were the only people at the pool and it was very nice (but small). My sister go out of the pool and was approached through the fence by a man in sunglasses. He asked her \"what room are you staying in.\" She asked him who he was and why he was asking for her room number (considering the security issues). He said he was the owner and pointed to the Beachcomber logo on his shirt. He then asked her how many people were staying in our room. She responded \"two.\" He said to her \"you have two people registered, but you take 8, 9 10 people to the pool\". (We had 4 additional people with us). Then he began going through a recital of how people register and bring back more people to stay in the room and steal things from the rooms. This simply was not what we had done--my daughter had her own place to stay. I came up to the fence and asked what was wrong. He then said the same thing to me about additional people staying in the rooms and stealing things. I responded if my daughter and grandchildren were not allowed in the pool, we would leave. He said that was not the point and went on again about how people bring more people than are registered and steal from the rooms (he would stop bringing this up, even though we were the only people staying in the room). This was completely insulting, as we are honest people and there was nothing of value in the room to steal (no shampoo, lotion, or coffee (usually provided by most motels). We got our things together and left the pool (we were there less than 45 minutes). This situation made us very uncomfortable the remainder of our stay. I felt they were watching us closely and we felt threatened by that man and others in the office (all men). We kept the deadbolt on during the night, but took all valuables with us when we went out of the room. I would never recommend the Beachcomber to anyone, ever.

My husband and I came to O.C. to watch a band at Fager's Island. This motel was the cheapest and closest to Fager's. It was $168 plus taxes, all the other hotels/motels were either not vacant or cost $200 plus and we checked out about 6. The motel met our basic needs and is typical for a busy place like O.C. We did have the misfortune of getting a unit that had a wet ceiling in the bathroom because someone in the unit above it had taken a shower while leaving the curtain outside of the tub. If you are a light sleeper, I DO NOT recommend this place. The traffic noise was horrible and we used a sound machine. The trash truck came at 6:30 a.m. on Sunday and made one heck of a racket out back. The beds are a little hard. The quick walk to the beach and some restaurants (BJ's) was convenient. The little kitchen was nice; however, I had to buy some coffee and fortunately brought shampoo because neither were provided. I was surprised at not having any shampoo. I left some coffee for the next folks.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MD", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel Great rates!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ilovefurrycritters", "ReviewID": "UR19266426", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 night stay at this GREAT hotel!

This Hotel is underrated for it's value & services.. a simple but very catering needs of it's guests. Who needs Gyms & indoor pools when your at the Beach! Many block's to walk to see things or go shopping if you want to excercise.. Short distance to the beach area & being at 75th street the best of being up-town if you want to go or downtown to the inlet & go to the boardwalk. This is an unexposed jewel for the simple beach stay without all the glitz & expense others charge..

The beach is literally 2 mins down the side street, no roads to cross, and is wide and sandy. The pool was clean and in the sun most of the day. Staff were pleasant and helpful, even supplying the ever needed corkscrew!! Various Restaurants right down and across the road. One with the biggest all you can eat buffet I have ever seen! Only down side was that the balconies faced the road but once the day time traffic calmed down it was lovely to sit there and look across at the sea and the stars.
