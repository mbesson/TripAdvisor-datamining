It was within 5 mins walk from the grounds of the Camp Nou. For location there is no better. The hotel itself was very clean and it had a welcome feeling from the staff on duty, they spoke English and offered help and advice. The rooms provide an adequate accommodation and the beds were very comfortable again the room was very clean. The hotel offers free WiFi connection which was great for my son to keep in touch with his mum. The only slightly negative point I could find is the fall points could do with some sound insulation.

The staff were both friendly & informative, nothing was too much trouble. The room was very clean, with high quality decor & amenities. (That also goes for the rest of the hotel). When I booked the break I opted to have the breakfast each day, I was so pleased I did. The food was of a very high standard & the staff were attentive. The hotel provided very good value for money.

It is a just a walk distant from Barcelona FC Stadium (so, if you will stay to see a soccer game, this is the Hotel). Price: The price is very good... So, if you want to spend a couple of days in Barcelona and spend less than 90 euros per day for a clean hotel. Madanis should be your choice. Issues: I had a problem with the Internet (that was free). It didn't work in my room. So, I needed to use in the main loby... I think the problem is structural...

The last problem had to do with \"sleep quality\", it rained all week and it seems that the outside dripping water from upper levels keeps pounding away at the room windows on ALL rooms ending with number 3 (ex. 203, 303, 403, 503, etc.).

The breakfast also was very poor, certain ammount of the food on offer is put out and left for so long that the quality of it was awful by the time we had breakfast at around 9.00am. Eggs, sausages, bacon, hams etc were never replenished for fresher food during all the time we spent in breakfast area. No facilities in rooms to make tea / coffee.

It has a nice location, if you don\u2019t want to live downtown Barcelona. It is about 10-15 min. walking from Nou Camp, the metro station is 200 m. away, and it is the Collblanc station on line 5. Around the metro station it is several shops like Zara, Mango and Douglas, if you like to shop. It has also some supermarkets close by and also a local market that is open in the morning until about 3 pm. The hotel has a parking garage right over the street from the hotel. If you buy a parking space at the hotel it cost 21.5\u20ac a night, and if you buy it at the parking it costs 24\u20ac a night. If you are going to stay several nights it is best to not pay at the hotel, then you can get the deal to pay 80\u20ac for up to 7 days. The parking is very small, so if you have a big car, it is almost impossible to go in with the car. Be careful! The reception is nice, and they are very friendly and helpful. They have also a small bar next to the reception, and also a laptop with Wi-Fi. It is free Wi-Fi in the apartments; don\u2019t know if it is in the hotel also. We have rented one of the apartments they have. We have rented a 5 persons apartment, with 3 bedrooms, kitchen, living room and a bathroom. The bedrooms is a master bedroom with a/c and a double bed, a single bedroom with one bed, and a two persons room with either a double bed, two single beds or a bunk bed. The living room does also have a/c. You have also a washing machine, so you can wash your clothes if needed. If you don\u2019t want to bother with making your own food, you can pay 7.5\u20ac and get the breakfast at the hotel (have not tried it), and eat at some of the restaurants that is close by. The apartment is cleaned weekly. We are very glad for the opportunity to rent an apartment at a hotel, rather than a private person.
