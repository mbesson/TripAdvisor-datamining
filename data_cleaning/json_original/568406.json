{"Reviews": [{"Content": "An average 4-star with helpful staff We booked this on ebookers, it worked out at about \u62e235 a night with was a bargain. When we eventually arrived, we were put in a room that stank of smoke, despite requesting a non-smoking room. The lady at the desk however, was more than happy to move us to a non-smoking room which was pleasant. A couple of negatives, firstly the smoking room we moved out of had a bath, whilst the non-smoking one didn't - I assume it is luck of the draw. Secondly, no tea/coffee facilities in the room.The hotel is a little way out of the centre. When we arrived, we got off the U5 underground line at 'Glessener Strase', there was then a fair walk to the hotel. I advise definitely taking either the number 30 bus to Friedberger Warte from Konstablerwache (a main U-bahn, S-Bahn interchange), or bus 34 to Friedberger Warte from the stop 'Dornbusch' on the U1, U2 or U3 line. These both take you virtually to the door. Do not be deceived by the front entrance having a restaurant name above the double doors, it is the hotel main reception.The food in the hotel is excellent, breakfast, despite being advertised as continental offered a good selection of hot options. We also had a bar meal in the 'cubes' bar adjacent to reception. The food was excellent in terms of portion, quality and value for money. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but the price list looked reasonable. We tried to eat at the restaurant 'Friedberger Warte' (on the roundabout opposite the hotel). Unfortunately, they were full, but it looked fantastic and very authentic!", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR182578418", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Tom083"}, {"Content": "Far out but Fantastic I really enjoyed my stay at this Hotel.

We thought the hotel was very nice. The staff were friendly, the dinner was delicious, and the breakfast buffet was one of the best we've had. The only problem we had was in finding it. If you are coming by car be aware that the hotel address is not in most navigation systems. We were informed by staff that the hotel grounds are on the site of a former US military base and the address can't be plugged into most GPS's. We had a very, very difficult time finding it, and when we called the hotel for help when lost they weren't able to point us in the right direction. We eventually drove to the consulate and drove around the block until we found the hotel. Only other thing of note was that the hotel seems to cater to Russians.

The fare was E3.55 one way, E8.40 for an all day ticket or E13.70 for a group all day ticket for up to 5 people (best value if 2 or more are travelling!).Check-in time for the hotel is 3pm, however they state on their website and in their hotel guide that they will try to accommodate early arrivals. We arrived in the morning after a long flight, but still could not get our room until 3pm. The check-in process was fast and efficient and the staff all spoke English very well. We had booked a double room, but were given a twin. The room was clean and newly furnished, but had no tv, fridge or tea/coffee facilities.
