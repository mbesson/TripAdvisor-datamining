The only problem was the hotel, firstly this is rated as a 4 star hotel and there is no way this is a 4 star hotel and just to note we certainly paid 4 star prices. The Bedrooms are unbelievably small, we actually asked to be moved but there were no rooms available due to a conference being held that weekend. Our bedroom was at the front of the hotel and the noise from the busy road all through the night was terrrible. It also states that they have a gym, there are only 4 excercise machines here, it like the bedrooms is far too small.

The big window/door did open widely to the courtyard, which helped, but there wasn't much breese most of the time.
