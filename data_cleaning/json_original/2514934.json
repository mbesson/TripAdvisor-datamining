Recently we selected the Mandarin Geneva for our stay there and were very disappointed in the ambience. I was excited and curious to see the new Paris Mandarin so we stopped in for a quiet and quick coffee, after breakfast and before lunch, on a beautiful warm early spring day. The lobby area is open and dramatic, and one can see the garden courtyard with a water feature running down the center upon which are built platforms exhibiting mannequins donning fashions which flutter in the breeze. There is a very, in my opinion, inelegant gazebo structure seeking I think to appear as a giant bird cage where inside are suspended colored umbrella-like sculptures or light fixtures over a circular bench made out of white plastic reminiscent of something from the Jetsons to which one gains access by ascending a platform staircase. The wooden decking of the courtyard contrasts sharply with the over-the-top striped marbled lobby which is intermittently decorated with goldy tiles. Esthetic tastes and choices are personal; if I were King Designer managing a decorating budget for Mandarin, I would not have made these choices. We were seated at a table which had linen placemats on it and a waiter eventually came to take our order. We waited many more minutes and were served coffee with a plate containing some cookies. I had to ask for sugar, which eventually came as my coffee cooled.... The cookies tasted less good than those found in a Lorna Doone box but I appreciated that they had brought them. The coffee was delicious! Yayyyyy! And we enjoyed sitting in the sun. The mannequins on the platforms in the water decoration were, in keeping with the rest, off-setting; a little like an experience in \"what is wrong with this picture?\". I kept trying to make eye contact with the beautiful stately young woman standing behind the empty entrance desk as no other customers came in to be seated for coffee or drinks and finally simply got up and asked her to bring our check after I asked her to direct me to the restroom, which she graciously showed me by accompanying me there. The doors to the rest rooms are raspberry pink shiny which is an interesting choice when combined with the glitzy marble floors; I again noticed this decoration because it struck a negative chord in my personal \"sense of harmony\". I can almost imagine the decorators having some fun with this, being so sick of having always to choose materials and colors that are the always-chosen ones. Too bad the overall effect is so tacky and drab. Of course the bill for the two coffees was what we would have expected; 28 Eur. The coffee was good but not that good and the privilege of sitting in their courtyard did not make-up for the difference. But I'm glad I went!

We arrived in the morning and was greeted by really friendly staff, our room was available straight away which is great when you are arriving off an early flight, offered coffee, breakfast etc...so far perfect. We are shown to our room we booked a Mandarin Room. We had previously looked at rooms before and this wasn't what we were expecting however we called down to reception and they showed us 2 other options and they really wanted to make sure we were happy. We choose another room which wasn't ready but they allowed us to stay in the other room until it was. We were bought welcome drinks, fruit etc which is always a nice touch. We had lunch in Cam\u00e9lia restaurant which we have eaten in severally times, the service is always impressive and the food is to die for. We had lunch here Saturday and Sunday it is always a lovely lunch. The puddings are a little taste of heaven. Our room was ready after we'd finished lunch and the new room was beautiful, beautiful views of the courtyard and beautiful rose petals in a heart shape on the bed and around the bath it was so romantic. The rooms are a really good size and the bathroom is amazing. The rooms have everything you could possibly want. We booked spa treatments for Saturday and Sunday. My partner had an aromatherapy massage which he said was amazing one of the best he has ever had. I had a facial my therapist was great it is by far the best facial I have ever had it was so relaxing. On the second day we had a couples room and both had full body massages, I had the same therapist and she was just as good, I always find massages hit and miss depending on the therapist and their technique, she was amazing and it was the best massage I have ever had, I felt so relaxed. They really make sure you are comfortable, from the oils used to the lighting, music and heating, if you can get an appointment I would highly recommend having a treatment. The pool is also wondering and very calming and peaceful. We had some cocktails in Bar 8 which are delicious....the only 1 issue we had was when you are in bar 8 you have to go to the other side of the hotel to use the toilet as the toilets right by the bar are only for the use of guest eating in the Sur Mesure par Thierry Marx restaurant which is very frustrating. We ended up staying an extra night because it was such a lovely place to be, very relaxing.

Excellent gym and pool facility, lovely interior garden, thoughtful touches (fresh flowers, advance technology features, travel steamer, etc). I can only make minor complaints. For example, I like the contemporary design, but the art work (fashion photographs) is terrible. Some minor service problems (had to make several requests).....but these kinks are no doubt due to the fact that the hotel is so new. The only other flaw was that the bar and signature restaurant were closed during our stay--this will no doubt be corrected shortly. But even the 'casual' restaurant, Magnolia, offered superb food and service. Overall, an excellent stay. The service is on par with even the Palace hotels in Paris--and is delivered in a much more friendly and personable manner.

The MO, however wins hands-down in terms of location (with Shangri-La coming in second because of her Eiffel Tower views). Smack in the center of Rue St Honore, your neighbors are Hermes and Lanvin, and an easy stroll to the Louvre, and across the Tuileries to the renovated Musee D'Orsay. I even walked to the Champs Elysees in about 15 minutes. Yes, it's a chic address, and you're paying for it. (The Raffles comes in the least pricey of the trio) Rooms are luxuriously designed and well-fitted-out with great bathrooms, but I don't understand the questionable art on the walls (fashion photos?). Also, the lobby and bar in particular is just on the right side of tacky (coloured glass stones embedded in the walls etc).

We booked the Mandarin room-that is a very big room and has a very nice design but we were expecting to have a balcony or a nice view in the garden. But in reality we got an ugly interior view with not enough light.The room was big. When we entered the room and went at the bathroom to wash our hands we found a whipping cloth in the sink. They took the cloth only next day in the afternoon. Then the room was looking gorgeous but there were no indications how to use the lights and we called the technical department that sent us a guy....... but he didn't know to use the lights and at the end we understood alone(playing with the system) that there is no way to have the bed lamps on if you are switching off the bathroom lights.\u2639 After the first day we wanted to have some still water from the minibar but........ the minibar had no still water. So we ordered at the room service....... but they delivered sparkling water and we pleased them to bring us the still one. This took them around of one hour!!! In the second evening in this hotel we were out for dinner and when we came back we noticed that we didn't receive any night service- to prepare the bed for sleeping , to open the tents, to supply us with still water for the night, etc. After the first day we were also expecting for the refill of the coffee machine but they didn't do it before we called again room service:no coffee pads, no coffee milk, no sweetener. During our last night in the hotel we went to bed at 10.30 pm but...... at 11 pm a terrible sharp noise started in our room without ending. We had a terrible fright and we called the front desk that told us they will send a technician immediately.We were waiting 20 minutes outside the room because nobody could resist with that noise and nobody from security or from the technical department came. after a while a lady from housekeeping came and promised us that the problem will be solve because is a malfunction on our floor with the sensors from the room, but she said that is normal because the hotel was recently opened. After all this I am very sure that I will not come back there very soon. It's too expensive for the quality of the service they are offering. I will not recommend it to anyone.

Strangely, we had a feeling they must have known we were on the way, because a Guest Relations person was at the door waiting to greet us along with the Rooms Division Manager - and warmly welcomed us. Like the Shangri-La, the Mandarin has a team of people to help with the bags and everything, so we just followed the lady who escorted us to our awaiting accommodations. Enroute to the room she interestingly inquired, \"How was our stay at The Shangri-La\"? We were baffled how she knew where we had come from. Later we discovered she asked the taxi driver for our pickup point... First thing to notice when arriving at the room was the absence of a room number on the door or wall. Instead, it is etched into a marble slab that makes up the threshold to your room - novel idea. Entering the room - your expectation is that this is going to be a luxurious 21st century experience - not just because the MOHG Corporate IT Department has loaded it up with all manner of goodies, but more importantly because it's a purpose built brand new Hotel and in the exclusive district of Paris - of course the room rate provides you some indication... A very spacious room - with an entrance corridor that gives you the feeling you are actually entering via the bathroom because on your left is the WC, bath and shower, and on your right are the vanity units one at each end of the assigned space. Interesting concept. It does not take the deduction powers of Sherlock Holmes to realize that this room is full of high class brands - like the B&O TV, Frette linens, Nespresso coffee, Mariage Fr\u00e8res Tea pot, Jing Chinese Tea, NEC IP Phones, Diptyque cosmetics, Bowers and Wilkins I-dock, Evian Water on the bedside and an Ad Notam Mirror TV over the bath. The only thing I felt missing were Cohiba cigars in an in-room Humidor. Maybe next visit - LOL. Oh, but hang on, what's up with placing a whole fresh mini Pineapple in the Welcome fruit amenity? Admittedly it looks beautiful - but honestly, how do you eat it? Our room like so many others in this courtyard-designed structure was equipped with a balcony, and overlooked the central inner garden complete with a humongous birdcage. Doubling up as an extension to the Bar, this venue has thankfully for me, evolved into a smoking area. Craving to take advantage of the golden opportunity to have a cigar, I suggested to my wife that we head down there for another pre-dinner drink (with the same friend as the previous night), but this time being outdoor, I could enjoy a cigar while sipping my San Pellegrino. Being the gentleman I am, I went down first and secured a table - which was assisted by, and under the watchful guidance of the Guest Relations Manager who had just checked us in. We got a lovely table, and when I informed the Server of the desire to smoke my cigar, he promptly summoned the Bar Manager. The gentleman brought with him a cigar ashtray, and graciously lent me his personal cigar cutter and a torch, which is best described as the same type as making the crust on Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was an exquisite two hours - me smoking my stogie, and the girls nattering away while imbibing their wine. A tough race, but I think the Mandarin had the most tech of any room we stayed in this trip (especially versus 45 Park Lane) - and quite candidly, I just didn't have enough time to check it all out - or do it justice. If I had one bone to pick - it would be the TV - which incidentally, is the central point for all the in-room technology. The B&O TV Beovision 7 can only be classified as impressive - and is stocked with goodies including internet radio, and a sexy play back function for one's i-device, through a Schneider-Electric spring-loaded dock which sits neatly under the TV and from which there is a pull out shelf to rest the gizmo - if needed. So what's my gripe about the TV? Funnily enough, it's the motorized bracket from which it is suspended. When you press the ON button on the sleek remote control - the TV auto swings out forty-five degrees for a better viewing angle from the bed - but, when it does so - it make a mechanical noise, and the exact same happens when you turn it OFF. Meaning, if you are watching the late show, and your partner is already catching their zzz's ahead of you, and you turn OFF the TV, then there is a chance that the motor noise will disturb them, and the same goes for when you turn it ON, as I've been known to do so in the middle of some sleepless nights. And there's just one other thing (perhaps not tech related) and that's the mirror inside the shower - which mists up when you steam up the room. I think that's a bug - otherwise how will you use the mirror in the shower? I didn't find a squeegee in my room, although I did make a general observation that European Hotels seem to like to include Toilet Brushes next to bowl... As morning quickly arrives, we somewhat bleary eyed reluctantly agree - even if we don't want to, that we can't lounge around all day in these superb surroundings, and have to jump in a cab to the car rental place to collect our car, and begin the 995km drive to Dinkelsb\u00fchl.

I have debated myself if I should book the more renowned Four Seasons George V with classical luxury or the brand new and way more contemporary Mandarin Oriental. In the end, the newness and more modern rooms of the Mandarin Oriental Paris swayed my decision. I also booked this hotel under the Virtuoso program. Even under this program, the rates are phenomenally expensive, but then this is Paris where everything under the Sun is expensive in this city. Arriving I arrived after checking out from the Renaissance. The hotel is located at the Rue St Horne, a supposedly upscale parisan location. The entrance to the hotel is surprising small, and it is easy to miss. Again this has to do with the fact that real estate prices in Paris are very expensive so most hotels will be of the small size variety, especially newer ones. I arrived early but my room was ready for me. Among the benefits of the Virtuoso program are free breakfast, a welcome amenity ( usually just simple fruit plate or tidbits ), a spa voucher and an upgrade to the next room category. The hotel wasn\u2019t able to upgrade me because they claim they are having full occupancy but I managed to exchange the Spa voucher with free internet which is much more useful. My check-in was handled by a very nice and friendly lady by the name of Pauline and she was gracious enough to show me the hotel restaurants and facilities before escorting me to the room. Upon entering the room, she also took the time to introduce me to the room facilities and explain how to get things to work. I requested a Blu-Ray player and she arranged a PS3 instead which is just as good since I wanted to watch some movies I bought in London. All in all, a great check-in experience. I speculated that Ms Pauline isn't French since she smiles a lot and was very friendly, something most Parisans aren\u2019t. :) The Room I booked a Mandarin Room, the largest room type in the Mandarin Oriental Paris. The room measures 50sqm and will easily qualify as a junior suite in other hotels. Most hotel rooms in Paris are small so the space is a real luxury. Glancing around the room, the d\u00e9cor is of the Art-Deco contemporary style with top notch furnishing. There is a very cool 40\u201d Bang & Olufsen TV, which rotates out from the cabinet when you switch it on and rotates back when it is switched off. The in-house entertainment system from the hotel provides TV channels, high definition programs and even games and other services. Unfortunately, the TV software failed to work many times, apparently due to \u201csystem error\u201d. There are abundant A/V connections and plugs on the work desk. There\u2019s no walk in closet but the wardrobe have amble spaces. The spacious bathroom is decorated in subdue white, very soothing and relaxing. It\u2019s a full ensuite with dual sinks, rainforest shower and a deep sinking tub with Ad Nortam TV built into the wall mirror. The water pressure is adequate and the bathroom fittings I think are the high end Axor Hansgrohe. The bathrobes are very large and fluffy. One thing I think one has to be careful about this bathroom is that the bathtub is very slippery. Also, as the designer is going for style over practicality, there are many sharp edges in the bathroom from accessories protruding out from the wall. This might pose a hazard to some. The bed is really the best part of the room, with soft silky linens and a very comfortable mattress with just the right amount of firmness, not too hard and not too soft. There are several settings for mood lighting but I thought the switches were kind of difficult to use. Wireless internet is provided which is very fast. Finally, there\u2019s also free mineral water ( Viola! ) and Nepresso coffee machine. One last thing, the room is truly whisper quiet, evident of first class sound proofing. Mine was a corner room and it is so quiet that I can even hear a pin drop literally. The downside for asking a quiet corner room is that there are no views at all. Rooms that feature terrace might be noisier since the terrace gardens are very popular with outside guests. Location and Common Areas The hotel is located in the upscale Rue St Honore with designer shops and boutiques just next door to the hotel. The famous Lourve museum is also a short walking distance from the hotel. The hotel is small so there isn\u2019t much places to explore. The hotel has a Bar and a Caf\u00e9 restaurant and both share the terrace garden. There is also a fine dining restaurant by the famed Chef Thiery Marx but it was closed during my stay so I couldn\u2019t try out. I end up dining at the excellent Le Cinq at the Four Seasons instead. The common areas are nicely decorated but doesn\u2019t really wow me like when I enter the Four Seasons. The Spa and fitness centre were located at the basement. The gym is well equipped but very small. Service Services at the Mandarin Oriental Paris are on an overall basis inconsistent, more of a hit and miss senario. Some are very good and unfortunately, some are rather bad. Overall, it\u2019s still rather rough around the edges, which is quite normal for a newly opened hotel. I will just list them down so you have a better idea. Let\u2019s get the negatives out of the way first shall we? Here\u2019s the long list : 1) Breakfast at the Camelia is really poor. The food served to me was bland and the pasteries and bread tasteless. I was expecting better food quality. The service was also very slow. It took them 15mins before my bread basket even arrived, and that is after I have alerted the Manager on duty. The Manager seems to be doing most of the serving while the staff just go slow and seems can\u2019t be bothered. It\u2019s a good thing that breakfast is included because no way I will pay 50 euros for this kind of food. 2) Most of the staff don\u2019t really follow up. For example, I asked housekeeping for some stickers for my luggage box, she said will check but didn\u2019t get back to me. I asked reception to put a dental kit in my room. That was forgotten as well. Also, I complained to Front Desk that the English Tv channels such as BBC were not working, she suggested that I can watch the French channels instead. 3) There\u2019s some re-curing software problem with the TV and a lot of programs are not able to be screened. The hotel attempt at service recovery by giving me a complimentary bottle of wine and some fruits but this problem repeat again the second night. 4) I asked the concierge to wrap a bottle of wine I purchased for check-in. Due to a change of shift, it was forgotten until I call to chase. 5) A Housekeeping staff entered my room when I have the Do Not Disturb sign on. He claims dubiously that he thought I have forgotten to turn it off. Well, in that case, what\u2019s the point of having a DND function in the room? 6) I asked for additional bath towels and the service attendant that brought it to me was rather unhappy because he bought the wrong ones and was asked to come again. I don\u2019t particularly enjoy looking a sour faces when I am staying in a luxury hotel. 7) The gym equipment was not regularly clean. All of them feel kind of \u201csticky\u201d. I didn\u2019t see any staff in the gym. It was empty. 8) The room service menu selection is mundane and boring, featuring such \u201cimaginative\u201d selections as hamburger and Indonesia fried rice. Ordered In-room dinning for breakfast as I am departing airport early.The food quality is just passable. Certainly not all is bad. There are some aspect of the hotel service that deserved praises too. 1) Competent Concierge staff, including arranging my transport needs and get a staff to escort me on an errant. One of the concierge staff in particular, Mr Jonathan stands out as being the most friendly and helpful of the lot. Every thing I asked to him were answered by \"not a problem at all!\" , \"Absolutely we can help!\", and \"My pleasure!\" . It's so refreshing to find a hotel staff that actually loves his job and show such enthusiasm. 2) Good check-in and welcome experience from Ms Pauline as described above. 3) The hotel staff learned that I was pick pocketed and lost my wallet along with cash and credit cards, much to my aggravation. The Manager on duty actually called and volunteer to help. Well, there\u2019s nothing much useful he can really do to be honest but I do appreciate the show of concern. 4) Attempt at service recovery after the TV didn\u2019t work with a free bottle of wine and fruits ( well, the TV still didn\u2019t work but at least they try\u2026 ) 5) I was on my way to a lunch appointment and found out that the pockets of my newly purchased jacket was still sealed. I called the in-house tailor and she was nice ( and competent ) enough to get it done in under 5 mins and rush it back to me on time. Now that\u2019s service! 6) Book a hotel limo car and the driver was kind enough not only to escort me into the airport but also going out of the way to help with luggage and tax refund. Now that\u2019s service! Conclusion It\u2019s quite clear judging from the room rates it charges that the Mandarin Oriental Paris attempt to position itself as a top-end luxury hotel in Paris. In the end, the results are decidedly mixed. The room is definitely gorgeous and well equipped and I love the bed. However, the service is not measuring up overall. While there are some outstanding individuals, there are too many cases whereby I need to call to chase. Some of the junior staff especially from housekeeping is not well trained and one can tell they are very uncomfortable when interacting with guests. Perhaps after a year or so, this hotel will measure up but as at now, I will only rate it a 4/5. It\u2019s a very expensive hotel and it needs to deliver to ensure guests feels they are getting value for money. Just having a nice room is insufficient. Areas that the hotel need to improve especially are the services and the F&B quality. The hotel needs to improve the training of the staff to be more service conscious and prepare to go the extra mile when called for. They should remember that they work for one of the finest luxury hotel chains in the world. So will I come back? Hard to say but if I ever will to come back to Paris, which is not a certain considering the crime rate and what I have gone through, I am likely to try the Four Seasons George V instead.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cA true 5*, but Has Yet to find its Reason D'etre in Paris's tough 5* market\u201d", "Author": "coffeebar", "ReviewID": "UR117049567", "Content": "New Mandarin Oriental Paris is a 5 stars class act that delivers everything you would expect.

It certainly charges the same amount per night as the older guys, but what does it bring to the table? The Ritz has an even more prestigious address on Place Vendome, and a lot more history. The Plaza athenee is famous for its fashion crowds and location and the Four Seasons is known for its outstanding service and costumer care. And there are other key players like Le Meurice, Le Bristol, Le Crillion and even Hotel Costes that shares the very same block on Rue Saint Honore with the Oriental.

We liked the location compared to the Champs Elysee area, where we have always stayed, which is very crowded with tourists. The Mandarin is a newly built modern hotel in Paris which has modern technology including a 32\" B&O TV in room, speakers in bathroom, Bowers & Wilkinson iPod dock, USB, AV and HDMI cables ready to plug into TV, music playlist on B&O TV, indoor swimming pool, fitness, steam and spa. Not many hotels in Paris can boast all this. We stayed at the hotel about 2-3 weeks after it opened. There were minor glitches but I hope these were due to the hotel being new and they will improve in the future.\u00a0 We stayed in a deluxe room located at the back of the hotel facing, well, the back. We stayed for 5 nights at \u20ac985 a night and wondered why we got stuffed into a room facing the back with a view of the building next door. The room was very very quiet though, as I think all rooms have double glazed windows. The room was well designed and my only complaint is the shower and bath area being situated inside a cubicle and towel racks were locate inside this cubicle, which had no ventilation, which meant towels were never dry.\u00a0 Cost of breakfast was steep: \u20ac55 for an American breakfast and \u20ac45 for Continental for an average breakfast. You can walk down to Laduree for a continental breakfast for \u20ac18.\u00a0 The swimming pool was exceptional as was the fitness centre, which had all new Technogym equipment.
