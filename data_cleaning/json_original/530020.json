{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great hotel if you do not have a room on the street We got to Florence and had time to walk around and check out rooms. This hotel was slightly out of the way of the main area, but only by a few minutes walk at most. The room itself was very nicely decorated, way above the 2 star standards, and run by a couple of nice guys. I want to rate this a very good place to stay and for the money, but we had a room on the street (somewhat quiet during the day), but nightmare when trying to sleep. The owners upgraded everything but the windows (need at least double pane). The entrance and exite for the market for the vendors is down the same street as our window, so you could hear the carts leaving and arriving each day, along with all the resturants below.", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR570944089", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "brett13sky"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay in Firenze (Florence) Hotel San Lorenzo was a great place to stay for the price.

Namely that although they advertise on their own website that they accept credit cards (M/C, Visa, Amex, Diners International), they insisted when we were checking out that they didn't (they said their machine was broken, and then the son came over to help his dad by saying, we've been trying to get one from the bank for a month now but they haven't given it to us yet, but somehow they managed fine to get a deposit from us that we paid by credit card). And while in the end they did us a favour b/c the credit card exchange rate was worse than the bank's back home, we actually ran out of cash later. So, be warned, they don't accept credit cards, despite what is advertised. Also, again, while advertised on their website about having a hair dryer, they don't have one. I know, sounds trivial, but after a long day of sightseeing in the sunny city of Florence, a shower and dry hair is all I wanted. Actually, they didn't have a phone either, despite also being advertised on their website. In addition, although the breakfast is included (therby justifying their comparably higher rates), it is not worth it, find a place that doesn't include breakfast. I know continental style breakfast is sparse, but this was ridiculous. On the table from which you take your food were: a bowl of cereal (literally, I shared it with my fellow traveller and we each had a tiny bowl of the corn flake-like stuff), 1 croissant, a pot of coffee and strangely enough, a huge basketful of butter. While we thought maybe we slept in and missed the breakfast, it was only 8am and there was only 1 other occupied room (they leave the doors open in the rooms that aren't occupied). Which is another thing, despite it being so empty, we were given a room on the top floor (they don't have windows, only skylights with some kinda glass that isn't translucent) and we had to share a bathroom (it's outside the room).And one more thing, they have a curfew which they mentioned to us as we were going out. Not that my fellow traveller and I are young 20-something partiers. Au contraire, you might call us homebodies actually. We just wanted to go out to get some food, we arrived by train at 8pm, checked in, had a shower and then wanted some food. To be told as we're going out at 10pm for something to eat by the son of the owner (who, I might add is probably around 15 years younger than us) that curfew is at midnight, is a bit much.So, overall, we felt misled, a bit ripped off by this 2 star hotel and patronized.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR110523836", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "lulula"}, {"Content": "Would never stay here again I booked through travellerspoint.com in association with bookings@bookhostels.comI originally would have rated this place as okay but with some problems due to the awful share bathroom (shower not in a separate space as the toilet and sink so everything gets wet in the room), and extreme noise due to the market, street vendors, and nearby restaurants, but due to the experience I had upon trying to check out I would rate this as terrible and would not recommend this establishment to anyone.This hotel states they take credit cards. Upon my checking out they told me the credit card machine was broken and I must go to the ATM and pay with cash. I argued with the hotel staff about this for awhile. An establishment can not state they accept credit cards and then insist that you must pay with cash. If their credit card machine was truly broken as a merchant they should have known that you can call in the credit card by phone and get it billed that way. I explained this to them over and over. They were insistent that I pay with cash. I was insistent that I could not as I did not have the pin number for the credit card, therefore I could not pay with cash, or withdrawal money out of the ATM. I finally told them they left me no other choice but to contact the embassy. At that point they wrote down my credit card information and said they would run it through when they fixed the machine. I just got home from my vacation last night and I will be verifying with my credit card company today that I was properly billed and for the correct amount since they would not give me a receipt. If there are issues I will be contacting the embassy and the Italian police. If this establishment tried pulling this with me, how many others have they pulled this with? I have to wonder if the reason why they wanted cash is to avoid paying taxes since there is no credit card paper trail, how anyone would know I truly stayed there. Due to this unpleasant experience I would not recommend this establishment to anyone.", "Date": "Jun 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR966717636", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lftrvl07"}, {"Content": "a true family run hotel This is a traditional hotel, no frills, run by a father, wife and son.

Great people, good value, excellent location, near all. Remember it is a 2 star hotel, good price, very clean, overlooking mercato centrale. It does get noisy in the early morning, but most hotels that are near the mercato do. All vendors get up very early to set up.
