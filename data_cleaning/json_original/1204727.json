I was expecting the room to be basic as it was a low price and we had booked a standard room. However, the room was not pleasant at all. The main problem was the mosquitos. While not very nice, I could live with a couple but there were more than that and the walls and net curtain were stained with squashed mosquitos, which looked disgusting. I have also been bitten a number of times. The cleaner, also unhelpfully left the window open which attracted more (which seems silly given there is an obvious problem) and did not clean the bathroom tiles or walls where previous occupiers had squashed them. I am surprised that with such an obvious problem, the hotel had not provided a zapper in the room. In addition, the room was extremely hot (this was in March) and when we tried the air conditioning it only blasted hot air. We asked at reception and they said they would turn off the heat to enable the air con but this didn't work and the room was extremely uncomfortable to be in, especially as we were unable to open the windows due to the mosquitos. The room itself was a good size but in need of a paint and clean to remove the dead mosquitos and there was also a large damp patch above the bed. The carpet was also worn and did not reach the edge of the room in places. The bathroom was clean (but not the tiles) and the bed sheets were also clean. The breakfast was very basic - croissants, bread and yoghurt. There was a selection of meats but this ran out and was not replaced. During our stay there was a lot of loud banging as it seemed builders were working on one of the rooms nearby, however we were not warned that this would be happening. Lastly, when we arrived the receptionist was on the phone asking someone to give them a 10 on Trip Advisor (not sure he realised it's out of 5!) because he said the reviews aren't that great. Not a good impression to begin with really, although I can say that he was very friendly and welcoming.

Televisions were portable size boxes, shower rooms cubicles, room temp was 30 degrees according to thermostat and air conditioning/heating unit did not appear to work and when we opened windows we wished we hadn't as the stink was indescribable. Went to ask reception to turn on the air conditioning, this was not possible as it was only April and air conditioning can not be turned on until June. I asked to speak to the Manager who was not available, reception telephoned him, when he turned up he took a telephone call whilst I waited for 10 minutes. I told him that the rooms were unacceptable and either he gave me a refund or moved us to more acceptable rooms. After much haggling we were moved to 2 twin rooms at the very top of the hotel, which were supposedly Superior rooms. Well beware if you have booked one of these, the travelling time from reception to room is approx 10 mins and involves 2 lifts, 4 flights of stairs, 3 security doors (key card required) a visit to another hotel and numerous corridors. Getting lost is a distinct possibility! Whilst these rooms were slightly more spacious, slightly cooler, had slightly bigger TV's and didn't smell when you opened the windows, you were likely to bang your head on the beams. The single pillow was like a rock, there were no towels or loo roll and the rooms came with an added bonus of 2 sets of bells (the clock tower and the Bell Tower) chiming on the hour every hour but approx 5 mins apart, so you could get the full effect of each toll and ensure that you had an extremely bad nights sleep. Having said this, the bells could be a problem in any hotel located close to St. Mark's Square? So after a delightful nights sleep we were looking forward to a fortifying breakfast, alas this was not to be. We had to wait to get a table and then were treated to an overstewed cup of coffee, fake orange juice, one small croissant each and the toaster that warmed the bread and had to go round 3 times before it resembled toast.

The hotel is just behind Piazza San Marco. We actually could see the bells of the Basilica full of snow from our room. We walked our way to Piazza San Marco from Piazzale Roma were all coaches stop and it took us about 45 minutes, maybe a bit more until you get orientated. I would suggest a water taxi to Piazza San Marco area if you have something more than a small hand luggage. Beware, Venice is full of bridges with steps so it might not be very easy with a large, maybe heavy, luggage. Breakfast was ok. Continental breakfast in a small breakfast room. No coffee making facilities. All three rooms used by our family had Jacuzzi and all were supplied with bath not showers. Staff was Ok. We were a bit hungry at our arrival but the restaurants were all closed. We were offered a cappuccino, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much, but at least we the receptionist offered us the least he could. The hotel is extended onto another building. This means lots of steps, corridors and doors to walk through. I would have probably got lost walking from reception to our room even on our third day. Our room was at the other extreme point of the other part. There was also a common area for our hotel, another one star hotel and possibly some residences.

A small point, we noted a very large crack in one of the walls, which makes you think that if there were to be an earthquake the building would crumble down within seconds.

Without a doubt the best feature of the hotel is its location. Just off Piazza San Marco. It is right in the middle of the tourist area. Very accessible to all parts of the island. Made it very easy to get to Basillica in the morning to get in line. (The queue was insane in summer.) Or see St Mark Square at night - highly receommended! A very convenient base for exploring Venice. I did not find noise an issue. The room is a good decent size for Venice hotel. Very clean. Didn't have much of a view but that's easily solved by walking 15 metres to San Marco! Rooms are quite charming - decorated in Venetian style. With Murano glass lights. I have read from a few reviewers that reception staff is a bit rude. Personally I think service is OK but not fantastic. They tend to be very busy and do let their guest stand there waiting for quite a bit. Has elevator in the building but a tight squeeze - so avoid large luggages if possible. Hotel has wifi but a word of warning. It doesn't reach all the way up to 3rd floor. I had to go downstairs to the lobby to use it. I walked upstairs with my laptop and it cut out on level 2. So ask for a lower floor if that is an issue for you. Breakfast was good. Typical of what's offer in Italy hotels of a similar class - toast, tea, pastry, fruit, yogurt etc. Did not use the bar so cannot comment on it. Overall, Antico Panada is a great choice for a few days exploring the art and architecture of Venice. I would definitely consider staying there again. Note: I had a LOT of trouble booking this hotel through HotelClub. They could not confirm the room for a very long time. I ended up booking direct with the hotel website - much simpler and faster.

Our room was okay, a little tired maybe, but large enough for two adults to move around in easily. The room had air conditioning and had plenty natural light once you opened the shutters. The bathroom was clean and had a great shower. The walls seemed to be reasonably thin, we couldn't hear voices but could hear anytime the room next door flushed the toilet! Breakfast is a simple continental affair, with pastries, toast, cereal, ham and cheese. It wasn't amazing but its free in a very expensive city, so why complain?!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situated between St Marks Square and The Pont Vehicio, both a short walk. My advice would be to check very carefully on a map of Venice exactly the location of the hotel before you go as you really do need to know what direction to take off in once you disembark from the vaporetto water bus. The hotel has a very small sign above the front door when you look up the alleyway it is on. It could be easily missed. The hotel itself was very good. We had booked a standard room for three nights but once we arrived we were given a superior room. No one actually told us at the time of checking in. It was only later when chatting to the barman that we realised we had been upgraded at no extra cost. While this was wonderful of them to do this we had booked a smoking room which are restricted to the standard rooms. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind really and just had to curtail our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchabit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 while in our hotel room. The staff are all very friendly and spoke English with us. The concierge organised for our bags to be delivered to our room by the porter which was wonderful considering the hotel is a bit like a rabbit warren with regard to the corridors. Breakfast was extremely well organised and the ladies who run the place very efficient. It was the usual continental breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cold meats, cheeses, bread, etc. The hotel can organise trips around and about in Venice so do ask if you would like this. We took the vaporetto water bus to Murano which was very enjoyable. We went to see two demonstrations at the glass factories there. The first was free and not very informative. The second one we paid 5 Euros for and it was brilliant. Murano is wonderfully peaceful after the hustle and bustle of Venice. If visiting Venice during high season then I would recommend getting up early at least one morning and walking the streets to see the city come alive before the tourists pour out of their hotels after their breakfasts. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredible how they move everything about the place. I would also recommend sitting out in St Marco Sq after dinner and relaxing with a few drinks listening to the divine music. It is expensive, (two rounds of drinks = 55 Euros) but the atmosphere truly wonderful. Great place to people watch too!

Bad news: The room was tired & worn & in need of an upgrade. The blanket on the bed looked dirty & we were glad there was a sheet in between. In the bathroom when we arrived were 2 shampoos & 2 small bars of soap. There was a tri-fold screen for the shower that we found difficult to use w/out getting the floor wet. There is a blow dryer, but you could not adjust it. I left a tip for housekeeping, but for the next 2 days the shampoo, soap, toilet paper & plastic cups were not replaced even though there was only a sliver of soap left in the tub & on the sink. I finally had to go down to the front desk to ask for the above items. There is no clock in the room, but the hotel does provide wake-up calls. The TV was attached to the wall, but was very high up. There was 1 English channel--CNN. The breakfast room was small & hot. The tiny bar was cute. There is a sitting room off the lobby. The elevator was slow & very small. The area around the hotel is busy & it can be noisy, but that did not bother us. The front desk offered to book a gondola ride for us for 40 euro each, but we would have to share it with 4 other people so we opted to go on our own. They offered to include a trip to Murano with the gondola ride. They will also make theatre & restaurant reservations. The staff was friendly & helpful.

The only good thing about this hotel is its proximity to St. Marco squire. It is literally minutes away from it. Everything else is very disappointing. Nothing in hotel looks like pictures on their site that are quite misleading. As I understand, they have a couple of new and larger room in adjacent building and that is what they picture on their site. Reality is very far from it. Our room was extremely small and Spartan. There were 3 of us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my husband, I and our 19-year old daughter so we had queen and single beds. And that was it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was no room for anything else including our suitcases (and we traveled very light!). In order to get anything from the suitcase we had to put it on our bed. Bathroom was very tiny with shower that had some kind of a strange folding barrier that made it very difficult to get into the shower and leaked onto the flow every time we took a shower. Our room was also very dark. Both room and bathroom windows had shutters over them all the time and there was very little of artificial light. Therefore, our room was very depressing tiny dark dungeon with very low sealing and tired d\u00c3\u00a9cor.

At night when we were leaving hotel, I asked about my gown again and was told that if my gown was light (what it was), it is easy to mistake it for the bed linen. They promised to check again and asked for my address so they can send it to me when they find it. Month and a half later I am still waiting for my favorite nightgown.

Let's start with the room, which included peeling walls, a broken safe, uncomfortable bed, broken air conditioner and dead bugs (killed on the wall and ceiling) just to mention a very of the lowlights. The rooms are small, which is understandable for Venice, but the bathroom did not meet expectations. The front desk staff was poor. A simple request for towels and extra bedding was denied. Instead the staffer said it was too late for the request and it would arrive in the morning. It never arrived. Prior to arriving we also requested a high level room to reduce the noise from the passing crowds, but we never got it. Though a higher level room was available the next day, they never followed through with our request. I attempted to purchase tickets at the frontdesk for the watertaxi ride to the airport, but was told they don't sell tickets. The sign just two feet from the man's head clearly indicated differently \"Tickets Sold Here, No Commissions\". He seem disinterested in helping, despite being asked by us several times for directions to the watertaxi location. A positive spot was the bellman, who was very helpful in getting our bags to our room. The breakfast was horrible. The same minimal offering every morning. The only highlight was the hot drinks, they were good. The staff was mediocre, at best. I also caution the advice of others who suggested the location was ideal. Sure, its close to San Marco, but its tucked in a very narrow path way that is constantly crowded from 8am to mid-night. It was difficult to getting luggage thru. Though I visited during the mid-to-high season, I would recommend searching another Venice district. The meal service in the San Marco area is very overpriced, and doesn't match the quality found in the other Venice districts. You can also find nicer hotels, at better prices, outside of the San Marco area. If you stay here and regret it, you can't say you weren't warned.

It is an obvious comment, but if you want identical rooms dont choose any of the small central hotels that have been converted from houses. It is not directly on a canal, so again if you want to overlook water from your bedroom, look elsewhere.
