The room we were in was very comfortable and very clean with adequate storage space. The bed was very comfortable. I particularly liked their super sized bathroom, amenities are adequately provided and nicely presented. The only odd thing is the shower screen was half size (it seems quite common in Italy), so you need to be a bit careful when taking showers to avoid water splashing out. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. They directed us how to get to different sites and advised us where the best restaurants were around the hotel. One of their suggested restaurant Ristorante Alessio we liked so much, we ate there 3 times. Overall, it\u2019s a fantastic hotel, good value for money, we will definitely come back when we in Rome next time, and we would be very happy to recommend it to other travellers For Australian and Asian travelers: There are no tea or coffee facilities in hotel rooms , and this seems common practice in Italian hotels.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clare,Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "BeefyClare", "ReviewID": "UR124353140", "Content": "I booked a double room via a well known web site and when we checked in we were told booking had been cancelled!

I love the location close to Termini (literally a block away) and I think is a great clean, well built new hotel. The room are ultra modern, the beds a great pleasure. This past stay was largely the same, except for a rather bad end to the visit. My complaints are otherwise very limited. First, the TV's 500 channels could afford to have one or two more English channels than CNN and BBC. They started me in an absolutely tiny room overlooking the block with a tram line, and all night the tram kept me up everytime it passed. The staff graciously found me a much more spacious inner room which was marvelously quiet. Even without having any sort of view, I was quite happy with the change. One complaint I have with this hotel is the bath/shower. There are no handholds, and you have to step WAY up and over the edge of the tub to get into to the rather slick surface to take a shower - still no handholds. They are a very serious accident (plus subsequent lawsuit) away from having new hotel owners, as getting around inside the tub is a very treacherous experience particularly getting out. I found the safest way to do it was slither out like a snake. My real disappointment came from the non-working phone system through which they were supposed to have given me a wakeup call. No ringing phone, I slept happily two hours longer than I wanted resulting in a 50 euro cab ride to the airport rather than a much cheaper train ride. When I asked the manager to help with the cab fare, she shrugged and said \"no, we can't do that\". Very disappointing. Would I stay there again? Probably.

We of course complained only for the non-caring staff to say that this is a good temperature and we shouldn't feel cold. From when is the staff's job to judge whether a customer rightly feels cold or hot or whatever? Their job is to help resolving problems and nothing else. It is obvious that management absolutely forgot to train their staff; needless to say that management was non-existent even when I asked to speak to them. I was told off (!) by the receptionist as unreasonable! These things are beyond this world and shouldn't even be happening to 2* hotels.

The breakfast was simple but excellent in terms of choice and quality of produce. Room service was expensive and a little bland. As a guide you can walk to most of the major historical attractions in under 20 - 30 minutes. The metro is very close (2 minutes) and this will get you to the Vatican in under 10 minutes...(The Vatican being the furthest historical site away from this hotel). The internet access was very expensive but they did offer full day or logon/logoff plans. 60eu for 3 full days or 18eu for 6 hours on demand. The staff were mostly helpful but definitely only did as much as they had too. We lost our bag at the airport (we don't speak Italian) and there was no help contacting the airport for us. We asked reception but really ended up having to do it our selves as we could tell it wasn't something the staff wanted to do or made us feel comfortable that they would handle it well for us. If you're new to Italy, don't expect to get any movie channels on the TV either. Italian hotels just don't seem to think there's a market for it. This hotel is no exception...but then, Rome is too beautiful to be stuck in a hotel room watching movies I quess...unless you're a kid! There's no gym and this part of the city doesn't really lend itself to running routes either, so if you're an exercise freak, probably look elsewhere I think. We did have a good experience when we bought some expensive wine at the hotel. The waiter arranged a small lunch for us which we didn't have to pay for. I nice touch but probably due to the price of the wine. There's no iron or coffee facilities in the room either. There was also no hair conditioner either. The room we had was also very small.

Our only negative comments would be that they charge for wi-fi and that we were given no warning about the Protest that was to happen on the Saturday, which we had to cross through to get back to the hotel. Lots of roads in central Rome were closed off, so there was no transport if you wanted to get a taxi/bus back to the hotel.

We were looking for a hotel with modern decor, as were are not generally fond of traditional Victorian era hotel looks, or Transylvanian / Dracula movie ambience. UNA fit the bill, and was also incredibly convenient to Romes Termini Station. We prepaid for our stay directly with the hotel through it's website. We came in from Rome airport via the Leonardo Express train, and hence arrived at Termini. We didn't realise that the Leonardo Express platform is in fact about half way along the Rome Termini, so walked a bit further to find the UNA Hotel than expected, but it was not too difficult. Our room was ready on arrival, a blessing after 24 hours (literally) of jet travel. Check in was effecient and the desk staff spoke good English, though desk staff are not necessarily the warmest we've seen. A porter assisted with out luggage, though it was not necessary. He accepted a small tip. The rooms are very small, as descibed by others, but there was enough space to lay out both our full sized luggage. The king bed dominates the space, and is comfortable. If you have read any of the reivews you should really expect this from the start, and the room size was comparable to any in Hong Kong,London, Paris or Tokyo we have stayed in. The bath room is a good size, but there is limited bench space to lay out toileteries. There is a safe, but it was tempremental to work. A small fridge could accept 1 litre bottles. There were no kettle facilities. The room cleaning service requires towels to be placed on the floor to be changed, and paper ticked for sheets to be changed. The room cleaning service didn't change our towels on one occasion, despite being on the bathroom floor, and after changing our sheets on one occasion, did not leave the chit for chagning sheets again. Breakfast is in a bright dining area. Staff are attentive, friendly, and efficient. Coffee was wonderful (you could even have weak, insipid, \"Americano\", but only if you hated the tast of coffee...!). The breakfast spread was limited (bacon, eggs, sausage, then a mix of cold cut meats, pastries, cereal, fruit), but very edible. The Leonardo Express aside, the hotel is really only 1 block from the main Rome Termini platforms. As were predominantly travelling by rail internally to Italy, this was a major plus. It is about 2 minutes walk to Santa Maria Maggiore church, 20 minutes walk to the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and about 1 hour to Saint Peters Basilica. The area feels reasonably safe walking back from those attractions, though the area around Termini Station itself a night has a different, much more edgier feel. The room cleaning issues aside, we enjoyed our stay at UNA Rome, and would consider staying there again. Benefits: Modern room, incredibly close to Termini Station, walking distance to all attractions (but must like to walk), wam breakfast staff.

We used to walk back as late as 11.30pm but there was very dodgy crowd on the street but we didn\u2019t face any major problems as it was a crowded area and quite well lit. The Hotel itself is clean and polished with polite front desk staff. They did not have free wi fi but there are cheap internet cafes for this nearby. The room and bathroom are spotlessly clean with soft clean sheets, pillows and towels but the major flaw, and I emphasize this because it does erode all the other pros of this hotel, is the room is so tiny (occupied 95% by the bed) that 2 people cannot move from the bedside to the bathroom! Its so surprising that they did not think of making the bed an inch smaller so that a person can walk properly from the bedside to the bathroom. There is not even space for 2 suitcases, just one and the room is soooo crammed that both people have to sit on top of the bed all the time. Whatever the other benefits of this hotel if you cannot walk from the bedside to the bathroom it really makes you question a second stay there. Having lived and travelled across several countries in Europe I do understand room sizes cant be huge but this was unacceptable for the price you pay to stay here. Other than this, the breakfast was plenty (Italian) and huge with proper cappuccino and polite staff. The front desks gave us a map, recommended a lovely restaurant for dinner and were rarely rude (common in many European hotels). The toilet was nice and clean with standard toiletries. The room however did not have any tea/coffee makers/ingredients. To summarize- Pros- near to Termini, clean, polite staff, good breakfast, soft sheets and towels, toiletries.

The location is great that it is very close to the rain station. At night some of this area can be a bit daunting though. The hotel decor is very modern - almost the feeling of a boutique hotel. The staff are reasonably friendly the room was a nice very modern room. The downside of our room was that the AC never went below 73 which, in the August heat was a bit annoying. Breakfast which, was included with our room was decent. On the second part of our stay we had another superior room but it had a different size( smaller) bed. After one night we requested another room and were given one and it had a larger bed. There seem to be no rhyme or reason as to what a superior room had for features. Two of the three rooms had only showers and one had a bathtub/shower combo that was almost impossible to get in and out of without slipping. There were a lot of little annoyances about our stay at the UNA hotel. For example: our room had free Internet but every day I had to go down to the lobby and get a new password and key for the wifi. This may seem trivial but it gets annoying after a couple of days. You could also only connect to their system with one computer or iphone at a time. This borders on absurd. While not a business hotel, many tourists now travel with computers and smartphones. Another small but frustrating thing was that there were no direction on the TV to find the English channels. While yes the hotel is in Italy, it is very common for hotels in non- English countries to offer English channels. I overheard another guest at the front desk asking how to access the English channels and found out that way. Another irksome area was the front desk. The front desk area can be quite chaotic at times. On many occasions stopping at the front desk always took more time than it should. I once waited for 10 minutes while the only 2 staff on the desk, dealt with the same customer. A few times while waiting for my wife, I watched how things were handled at the front desk. I watched one person wait patiently for quite a bit of time and then watched another person walk up to the desk and be served while the other person was still waiting.

I was to email my card details back to the hotel. Not being happy with send my details via email I sent 1, 2 & 3 separate emails on consecutive days prior to our holiday... not once did the hotel reply. In the end I phoned the hotel direct & gave my new details over the phone. This lack of reply did not surprise me as I gave up sending or trying to send the hotels price promise guarantee form when first booked in May... Expedia were cheaper than the hotel direct (about 40 euros per night)... but could not confirm the extra bed for our daughter in the room, they only said she was included in a double room, the hotels own website though only lets you book a family room if a child is on the booking form... Upon arrival we headed to the front desk... not many smiles there... after handing over our reservation details we were told that access to our room was not yet permitted right up to the 2pm time... maybe me just being petty... but being made to wait in reception for 15 mins and then told you can go up now as soon as the clock struck 2.... We arrived at the hotel via the MA Express train from the airport... 28 euros for 2 adults and a child... the hotel is easily in view from the main entrance of the train station in Rome. Upon enquiring to reception about a taxi back to the airport we were informed it is 45 euros... 17 more than the train, but we thought why not we're on holiday etc... all was good until I informed reception we have 3 cases... one each... Oh... how big are they?... standard size was the reply... about 80cm tall etc... the guy behind the reception desk then said will they fit in a Mercedes!!!.. What size boot does the Mercedes have I replied!!! He just said... it's a Mercedes, you will not be allowed to use the back seat for a case as it has leather seats!! Honestly I could not believe it.... he then said we should really get a bigger taxi, but that will cost 55 euros... We got the 28 euro train again & it was fine... The room was ok, well laid out and clean, the bathroom however had a cracked glass top around the sink area and there was some pretty nasty back grime around the hand held shower head... obviously not cleaned for some time. A shame in such a new hotel. The second night we were there we had a constant flushing of water sound rushing above our hears all night... either the occupants above had a dodgy pizza or our room was sited next to a drainage pipe... either way the room was not well insulated from this sound. Breakfast was by far the best asset to this hotel, very friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble for these guys & girls... the spread was plentiful too, very nice quality produce... well done all round here, if only the reception staff shared their smiles & customer service skills! Unlimited Minibar & Wi-fi... 10 euros per night (only available at time of booking)... good value for the minibar (2x cans of beer, 3 cans of soft drinks, water, nuts & pringles... re-stocked daily... the wi-fi was another reception blank... it is only limited to one device.... so if you go as a family as we did only my iphone was permitted... (we used skype on it)... the daughters netbook & wifes iphone were not allowed to be connected as the password is only valid for one device... not that much of an issue but worth noting. The location is great and close to the numerous hop on hop off busses, we use the yello Roma Cristiana ones this time and had no problems, very reliable & all the headphone sockets worked!... the only downside on the location is late at night the area around the hotel can appear quite rough with poor lighting between the hotel & station, there were plenty of people standing around doorways, smoking, shouting & drinking etc...

When we got back, there was a different person working the desk so we managed to get up to the room and stay there. The only reason we did this was because we had no other choice. It was that or sleep on the street. I can't blame the staff for this mistake but It would be nice if their website made it very clear what a \"classic single\" is.

We had requested for a connecting room which was not available and we were offered 2 rooms on the same floor but not connecting. With children as young as ours, this was not a feasible situation. The receptionist said she could not downgrade our reservation which we were willing to do just as long as the rooms were connecting or even next to each other. It is not possible, she says. So, respecting the fact that connecting rooms were not guaranteed and merely a request, we decided that we will stay the first night at the non-discounted rate (discounted rate had a minimum stay of 3 nights) and look for alternate accommodations the next day. The lady receptionist went off on us and told us that we just arrived and why were we talking about moving to another hotel and told us to sit in the lobby while she looks for a better solution. Well, we waited for approx 25 mins in the lobby directly in front of her, while she continued to check other guests in. Finally, she approaches us and tells us nicely that she was going on a break and that another colleague will be helping us. That actually worked for us, since the other lady, Mara, was very pleasant and gracious and upgraded us to an executive suite without additional costs. Past that, we thoroughly enjoyed our spacious room that had a king sized bed and an adjoining living room w/ a sofa queen bed and the amenities were great including turn down service. French sliding doors in between the master and the living room gave us some privacy. The bathroom was so spacious, it included a tub/shower combination on one side and a full sized glassed-in shower on the right! It would not be right if I did not mention the BREAKFAST. It was extensive, delicious, and offered gluten-free breads etc. The breakfast STAFF were so courteous and efficient! We were greeted warmly and did not have long to wait. The male manager was so attentive and directed the breakfast staff so well that my daughter said he reminded her of a conductor in an orchestra! The location was great, only one block from the Termini and all tourist sites were so accessible, even to the Vatican City. (Metro air conditioning was great compared to Paris but the terminals are dirtier. Rome Metro was so easy to use- literally an 'X\" ). We had 2 young children and our safety was NEVER an issue. The area was so well lighted. In fact, we even walked to the Termini and used the Metro around 9pm to go back to the city center. My suggestion to the hotel is to improve communication between staff in the reception area since the lady checking us out was charging us way more than what was agreed upon. We told her to speak with Mara about it since she made the arrangements for us, only then did she believe us and charged us for the original amount. Oh, well.

You have to get a ticket from a desk just before you go out the door of the airport to make sure you get the 40 Euro fixed rate, otherwise the taxi will be on the meter.

The room was one of the largest we have seen with a bathroom to match, a bath large enough for 2!!, a superb overhead rain shower plus an additional shower, bidet, radio/TV control, heated towel rail and a PHONE?? Lots of room to move around, a KING size bed, mini bar, free digital safe, a new flat screen TV, looked about a 30inch model, our only gripe was the lack of english channels, only CNN, but hey who goes to Rome to watch TV. Cannot report on the restaurant as we dined out except for the includeed Breakfast Buffet. The menu outside of the restaurant looked very comprehensive, I am sure you would be more than satisfied if you wanted to dine in. The Breakfast was excellent, very good choice, hot & cold food, DIY toast etc, wide range of fruits, yogurts, cereals, pastries, croissants, etc, etc. The service was very good, all of the staff were very friendly & helpful, as were the reception & bar staff, cannot fault them at all. The location of the hotel, one street away from the main rail station,(Termini) & Metro, is at the top of Via Cavour & very convenient for the whole sightseeing process. We did have a few doubts when looking at other reviews which painted the area as seedy & not very nice, whereas the reality is different. The Colloseum & Forum is a downhill 10 to 15 minute stroll, admittably the return is uphill but you can hop on the Metro which is right outside of the Colloseum & for 1 euro & 2 stops, 5 minutes, you are back at the hotel. A bit of advice for the Forum & Colloseum is to use the Forum entrance which is opposite the end of Via Cavour, 1 ticket gets you into both sites, also if you are a senior show your Passport or photo ID, I used my driving licence, & we got in for 10 euros for both of us, the full price is 12 euros each. Do the Forum first & Colloseum 2nd, when you get into the Colloseum there are 3 lines, 1 for groups on left, 1 for pay at the gate on right, go up the one in the middle & you should, like us, not queue at all just walk sraight in. Same for the Vatican, 1 euro each takes you to Ottoviano, 6 stops from the Termini, 10 minutes, a short stroll takes you to the Vatican Museum for the Sistine & to St Peters square for the Basilica. In fact you can use the Metro to see all of the sites & keep the walking to a minimum & at a low price.

When I asked the gentleman at reception if he could help me book for certain attractions (Vatican and Colosseum), he told me to look online and book it myself.

It is conveniently located for taking any sort of transportation though. The room we had was relatively roomy for a big city standard hotel room; we could walk around the bed and plenty of space for our belongings. Also the room was very, very clean and shiny including the bathroom. Service at the reception and during breakfast was very attentive and nice. Some downsides were that the room was very, very hot, even in February. Perhaps the airco does actually work during the warmer months? I didn't bother to check cause the window could be opened. For some this might be another downside though as it gets pretty noisy outside, but it's mainly traffic noise, so rather lulling in my opinion. Another minus was the fact that the speaker in the bathroom with the sound from the TV could not be switched off and that the volume in the bathroom remained loud despite having it turned to silent as much as possible. The bass tones kept droning through the wall when watching TV. Also the selection of internation channels was rather disappointing and it took a while to figure out where they were hidden on the remote as there was no booklet with information on how and what. Internet use was not free, so a simple thing like checking in for your return flight will cost at least 3 euro as that's the start tariff and the reception has to go through a whole ordeal of creating a personal account for you.

Mainly because of the rain we bite the bullet and paid 40 euros each to jump the queue and have a guided tour. Well worth it as the guide was really informative and even in the Sistine Chapel when silence is the order of the day she managed to talk quietly enough to explain about all the paintings and the significance of different parts of the most famous wall possibly in the world.

We took the train in from Florence and walked 2 blocks to the hotel - super convenient! Cons: Of all of our stays in Italy, the Rome staff was the most abrupt. They're not rude - they just aren't super friendly. The hotel is rather large and some days we had to wait for breakfast. There is a market at the train station which we found useful to buy water and other snacks. While the area is convenient, just be careful if you head towards the train station...it is a little sketchy there (people standing around, dirty shops, etc.) but do not let that sway you from staying here. It is close to everything and there is so much to see. At the end of the day it is so nice to go back to this clean, new, hotel. We would definitely stay here again!

At the historic baths a few blocks away I saw the mobile health service van giving the homeless Heroin addicts their \"treatments\".

The room was very comfy, with lots of space everywhere for bits and pieces, a lovely TV which did pick up more than 7 English-speaking channels, an easy to use safe and minibar, and a gorgeous spotless bathroom. The windows in the room also opened out fully onto a metal railing so you could have them open while in the room and not worry about anything coming in.

The hotel has done its best to sound proof its rooms but there was still a slight dulling noise of traffic in the bathroom. This didn't bother us though as the room, breakfast and price more than made up for this in a city which charges more for hotels than New York and Tokyo put together.

The location close to the train station and metro is not perfect but it's compensated by the price. Termini station is not a very pleasant place at night, but is not that bad as some reviews say. It's a area loaded with hotels and therefore, packed with tourists during dinner time. It's real close to everything by walking, which is a real good option taking in consideration that the traffic in Rome is chaotic even on the weekend! The hotel is new and very modern with a fantastic decoration. The room has a good area, with a good fashion furniture and the bathroom is also large. The blinders (black out) on the windows leave the room in complete darkness, which is very very rare go get. The bed is a 200x200 size with a medium hard mattress. Bed linen is good, done with two bed sheets, not very usual this days, and the bath towels are large in good quality. The breakfast has a good variety and is served until 10:30. The only small thing that the managment could improve is to clean some spots in the walls in the room, some uncarefully persons manage the luggage in a manner that it hits the wall.

It was an excellent stay and definitely a very nice property for business travelers. I\u2019ll describe the highlights along with the pros and cons as I see them for other travelers. First is the main \u201cproblem\u201d that some reviews discuss: the location near Termini station. It is undoubtedly a mixed aspect of the hotel. On the positive side, it is only 1 block from the station, so it is a convenient location for trains, the Metro (it\u2019s the only place where the current two lines cross), streetcars, and buses. It is also easy to get a cab from there because of the queue at the station. The station also has fast food, a large bookstore, and a variety of shops. If you take the Metro, you can get quickly to the Colosseum, the Spanish Steps, and the Vatican. On the negative side, there are few good restaurants nearby and it is not very convenient for the areas with the best restaurants and shops (Centro Storico and Trastevere areas). Then there is the question of personal safety. We did not feel threatened or otherwise in any danger, but the area to the South was clearly a \u201clower rent\u201d area. If you walk towards the West and North (basically towards the central tourist areas), and either stay with others or don\u2019t stay out too late, then you\u2019ll probably feel no different than being in any other major city. In short, this seems like an overblown issue. A note on distance to the restaurant areas (e.g., near Spanish Steps and the Pantheon): you can walk there in 30-40 minutes from the Una, if you are a reasonably in shape walker. Expect some minor slopes on the way back and to get hot and sweaty, but overall a pleasant and reasonable walk for people who like to walk. Now, for the hotel itself: it was great! I stayed in a \u201csuperior room\u201d with terrace, and it was larger than I expected and exceptionally clean. I mean really, really, exceptionally clean. The hotel is new and very modern and the furnishings were not only high quality but immaculately kept. The bathroom was large and would be very comfortable for two people (with the exception that the shower in my room was a combo shower/tub that would only serve 1 at a time). The terrace was pleasant and roomy with a small table and chairs; no particular view but nice for a fresh air break. The bed was comfortable enough: not too hard, not too soft, with plenty of room all around and several pillows and a nice (and clean and covered) comforter. An interesting feature was bedside controls for the room lighting. Housekeeping service was unobtrusive and seemed to be very efficient, attending to the room promptly when I was out. One sign of both its value and cleanliness was that I observed several Japanese tour groups staying there (who were well-behaved and no reason for concern). In the room, the Air Conditioning worked very well \u2013 it was able to keep the room quite cool and dehumidified. I had feared that it might be the older European style system that provides little cooling, but it wasn\u2019t. As some other reviews noted, the hot water did not get very hot. It was warm enough for a comfortable shower or bath, but might bother you if you like it really hot. For my part, I\u2019d much rather have the great AC. The only substantial inconvenience I experienced was with Internet access. I signed up for the prepaid whole-trip service \u2013 a bargain at 15E per day including mini-bar beverages \u2013 but it required going to the main desk each day to get a printed code. I strongly recommend to go with the prepaid service as it will save a lot over the pay-as-you-go model, but the new code every day was a hassle. As for Internet speed, it was adequate but not great. It was good enough for email but you could expect problems with services such as Skype at peak times (evenings). The hotel rate provided breakfast, which was substantially better than I expected. It was a self-service \u201cbuffet\u201d format with both quality and extent higher than my typical experience in Europe. The foods included a variety of pastries, cold cuts, cheeses, juice, fruit, cold cereals and muesli, coffee (either American style or espresso), and a couple of hot items (e.g., scrambled eggs and sausage). The room was large and pleasant but also somewhat busy. It made for a great start to the day but would not really serve as a \u201ccaf\u00e9\u201d style leisurely breakfast. Other reviews have mentioned things like an odd shower curtain and dirtiness. I saw two rooms and both had glass showers, and my room and my colleagues\u2019 were all spotlessly clean, so perhaps those reviewers were unlucky. As for service, I had only moderate demands (laundry, wake up calls, and the like) but those were all handled well (and in English). It is clearly not a Ritz or Four Seasons, but was good for its class. Overall, the hotel exceeded my expectations and was a relative bargain for the price: definitely not cheap, but with a room that was larger than expected, very clean and modern, quiet for sleeping, and a very nice breakfast option. If I return to Rome on business, I would be happy to stay there again. For a personal trip, I would also strongly consider it; I would weigh its quality and value against the slight inconvenience of its distance from good restaurants.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cAdequate room, poor shower system\u201d", "Author": "OntarioCanuck", "ReviewID": "UR81980480", "Content": "As other reviews, twin beds pushed together, we had the circular shower curtainwhich unless you were VERY VERY careful resulted in flooded bathroom floors.

Walking to the hotel from the main entrance of Termini takes less than 3 minutes! The hotel is newly renovated and is very modern and clean. Having arrived at close to noon, we were disappointed that our room wasn't ready yet. The reception at the hotel also wasn't the warmest nor friendliest. Our room booked for 3 was of a decent size and was able to accommodate a full-sized sofa bed on top of a queen sized bed. Bathroom was a bit small, though it was nicely designed. I added EUR 30 for internet and complimentary minibar for the 2 nights I stayed and found it to be worthwhile if the hotel has such a promotion. The internet was fast and there was a good choice of non-alcoholic drinks in the minibar. No branded toiletries in the bathroom, but they were alright and comes in nicely designed bottles which could be re-used. Breakfast offered at the restaurant had a wider choice than the one at Venice, though was of lower quality. It was also crowded during breakfast as the hotel seems popular amongst tour groups. During our stay, a large section of the restaurant was occupied by a Japanese group. The concierge was able to provide reservations for tours within the city, though I don't recommend going with the tours they suggest as the tour felt too rushed. One complaint we had was that on the last night, the hotel's water supply was chlorinated, and thus it made it impossible to bathe comfortably. Not sure if it was a city-wide problem or not, though the hotel did not communicate anything to us. We got to know of it through a housekeeping lady which brought us mineral water, and only after using the water which we thought felt funny. For the price we paid at around EUR 200 for a night, the accommodation was decent and good value for money.

It was an easy hotel to find - being located only a block or so away from Termini train station. They say the area is dangerous being close to the station, but we only noticed that very late at night and only if you find yourself on a dark street (just stay on the lighted, busy tourist streets around there and you'll be fine). Oh yeah - there's a nice little grocery shop located directly across the street where you can buy snacks, water, beer (much cheaper than in restaurants), wine, etc. We were offered an upgrade for our honeymoon and took it, however, it was an Executive Room on the first floor (only a little bit bigger than a normal room) and, being light sleepers as we are, we could not even get a wink of sleep because a tram comes right next to the hotel - almost sounds like a jet engine warming up when it comes by every 5 min or so up until 2am every night. So after that first night's stay, we asked to be moved to a \"quieter\" location and they immediately moved us to a standard room on the 4th floor which was perfect for the remaining 4 nights of our stay. The hotel staff is wonderful, you feel very safe with the \"big Italian\" security guards standing at the front of the hotel night and day, the breakfast buffet is perfect - eggs, bacon, breads, danishes, cheese, cereal, juices- you name it.

Bad mistake! First of all, the hotel is located in a really AWFUL part of Rome, near an area notorious for prostitution and drug dealing. Having accepted that, given its close proximity to the railway station, we found that our room was very small and minimalist. OK, not a big deal as at least it was clean. The beds were typically Italian - in other words ROCK HARD! How anyone could sleep on these slabs of granite amazes me. I did not have a single night of decent sleep thanks to these terrible beds. At least the shower worked well. Breakfast was the usual Italian fare: little hot food other than some low quality scrambled eggs, undercooked mini-sausages and bits of streaky fried fat that resembled something like bacon. On the positive side there were many types of pastries for those who like to eat sweet things in the morning (I don't) and also bread, ham and cheese. The coffeee served was of good quality. One evening we decided to have supper at the hotel - it proved a disaster. The hotel provides a 15% discount for guests on the very expensive list prices, bringing them down to merely 'expensive'. The portions served were insultingly small; my 'half chicken' was more like two legs of quail! Also, the menu choice was extremely limited and accompaniments to the main courses a very strange selection indeed, marked by a total absence of potatoes. The waiter then served my wife's dessert from the set meal menu she had chosen and totally forgot to ask me if I wanted a sweet at all - very unprofessional behaviour.

The complimentary breakfast was one of the best I'd had (although didn't remember we had access to it until the last day when I overheard the front desk informing another guest of it... wished we'd been reminded of it when we'd checked in... my bad).

It was a buffet style breakfast that was included with the room that had juice, meats, pastries, bread, fruit and yogurt. They even had \"American Cafe\" which was just like American Coffee. We didn't eat there for dinner so I cannot comment on that aspect of it but I would venture to guess that it was very good.

The hotel has only been opened for less than a year which means that the place is spotless, very clean. The room we stayed in was a superior room which was bigger than the usual small rooms on offer in hotels in Rome. The bed was massive and very comfortable. The ensuite bathroom had a big bath and a very good overhead shower, no problem for a 6' 4\" giant. Breakfast was a buffet style where you helped yourself to the food. Almost anything you wanted was here, the only thing you couldn't get was a traditional english fry-up. The waiters at breakfast were excellent, very attentative, we ordered tea, coffee & hot chocolate (what pigs!) all in the same sitting. Nothing was too much trouble, The bar & restaurant are very expensive, even for Rome, and the choices didn't seem that extensive or appealing. There is a lot of road works going on around the hotel, so it can be quite noisy. Also, where our room was located (425) there is a lively restaurant across the road which can be a bit nosiy at night, but not too bad.

I paid around 70 Euros a night which was extremely good. The hotel is excellently located on the road next to the main train station so easy for Airport trips on the Leonardo Express. The main reception area of the hotel definitely has the wow factor, clean, marble effect. Check in was very quick and easy and even gave you a free guide book. We had a great room although the view wasn\u2019t great (looking out across a courtyard in to another wing of the hotel) but we were not in the room much so didn\u2019t bother us at all. The bathroom is very spacious and clean with complementary slippers (although no bath robe). The shower head is huge so great for long showers to prepare you for a day of sight-seeing! The rooms are cleaned daily and to a high standard\u2026 even folded my clothes that I had left draped over a chair! Breakfast was included in our room price (even better!) but I\u2019m not sure it would be worth paying extra for. There wasn\u2019t any cereal on offer, but they did have the typical European breakfast of cold meat, cheese, cakes etc. They did offer a cooked breakfast but it was limited to the English taste. However, adequate for us! The only small thing i would say is that the concierge is not very helpful (he may have been new!) but he didn\u2019t know the Vatican opening times (FYI- it is only open on Saturday mornings, closes at 1pm, shut on Sunday...) and when we asked if he could recommend any restaurants, he said the restaurant at the hotel is very nice. That may be so, but when in Rome, you want to experience other restaurants! We took the metro to the Spanish Steps and made our way back to the hotel visiting all the other sites such as the Trevelyan Fountains, the Pantheon etc and managed to get back to the hotel without taking any public transport so even though the hotel is not near any of these big attractions, they are walkable if you don\u2019t mind walking long distances! The Coliseum is definitely within waking distance. Get there early as the queues are huge. We had a Roma Pass (you can buy them in the main train station next to the hotel) which allows free entry to 2 attractions (excluding the Vatican) and then queue jump as well as free transport for 3 days (excluding the Leonardo Express). Definitely worth getting if only for the queue jump! A great little restaurant is called Giggetto Al Portico D\u2019Ottavia (http://www.giggetto.it/english/home.htm) which is traditional Roman food and reasonably priced. It is very popular with the locals so I would suggest booking in advance or going early. Our waiter was very good at suggesting dishes and wine to go with it. We had picked a more expensive wine and he suggested a cheaper one (!) which complimented the food exactly. I think he even gave us a free dessert (we were there a while as enjoyed the atmosphere so much!)", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel - bad sleep\u201d", "Author": "747/400", "ReviewID": "UR62492612", "Content": "After much deliberation I finally settled on this new hotel near Termini Rail station in Central Rome.

We arrived early (10am), but could not get into our room yet. Anyhow the front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming (An attitude you will not find very often in Rome being a non-Italian speaking tourist.), handed us a map and a travel guide. When we returned later at 2pm, we finally could get into our room. The room was beautifully designed and very bright (due to its white painted walls). But beware that the design is quite modern and might not meet your personal taste, if you're more into baroque Italian style. Nevertheless the room was quite big, had a comfy bed, a nice flat-screen TV (with BBC World being the only non-Italian channel, we could find), effective blinds, temperature control units located on the wall and on both bedside tables. Although it was winter and the outside temperature was around 10-15 degrees Celsius, we did not manage to get the room temperature below 23 degrees. A big plus on the other hand is the quietness of the room. Being only a few hundred meters away from Romes Termini central train station, we expected some noise to be heard in our room, but nothing! The bathroom was also quite big and was equipped not only with a toilet, shower and sink, but also a bidet. The shower itself featured a detachable shower head as well as a rainshower head mounted to the ceiling. A full range of toiletries had been provided. The huge towels were soft. Being a techie I appreciated the RFID key cards, which you did not have to insert in the room door's lock, but just had to briefly hold in front of the card reader next to it. Also the LED lighting installed in the wardrobe's clothing rail, which would light up when being opened, was a nice gimmick. Breakfast was a lot better than the usual Italian breakfast fare. Anyhow being a German-Thai couple, who likes to travel a lot and used to European-American-Asian breakfast buffets, we were left a bit disappointed. The broad selection of sweet cakes and pastries was nice, but the scrambled eggs and the too greasy bacon and Italian sausages were cold. So we also tried the toast and bread along with the meat cold cuts and cheeses, which were ok. Compared to all the other hotels we had stayed in Italy before this is by far the best!

On arrival, our bags were grabbed by a porter despite us wanting to take them to our room ourselves, resulting in us having to give a 5 euro tip due to us not having any change (the hotel reception wouldn't change a note for us). When we were shown the room, it was clearly a standard double room, not the executive kingsize with sofa that we had booked and paid extra for. The porter called reception for us, who were insistent we were in an executive room. After a few minutes of \"discussion\", we were moved to another room with kingsize bed and a sofa. However, we were still not convinced we were in an executive room as there were no tea & coffee making facilities (an extra in the executive rooms). We tried to call reception but our phone didn't work, which meant another trip down to the foyer...not the best start to our stay. We were provided with a kettle and some tea & coffee but no milk, be warned that if you like milk with your hot drinks it costs 3 euros for a small jug from the hotel bar (this appeared on our final bill). The room was very cold for the first couple of nights, the air con was set to come on automatically (it kept kicking in, even when we switched it off). There was no form of heating in the room so we asked for extra blankets. The settings on our control panel seemed to change after the second day with the maximum temperature increased, not sure if other guests had complained but it was a lot more comfortable once the room was warm. The hot water was a bit hit and miss in the mornings, on the first morning we had no hot water for about 5 minutes (nothing came out of the tap!) then it suddenly kicked in. One thing that the hotel doesn't advertise is that there are major roadworks going on around the hotel at the moment, it was very noisy from early in the mornings with builders digging up the road and laying pipework. Not exactly relaxing! The area around the hotel (Termini) also leaves a lot to be desired, I'd recommend you stay closer to the centre if possible both in terms of safety and convenience. Overall, we found the hotel really disappointing and we wouldn't stay here again or recommend it. We were made to feel we were being a pain for complaining about our room and asking for the extras we had paid for. If you pay for an executive room, make sure you get one!
