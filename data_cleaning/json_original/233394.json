Al Ponte should not be listed as a hotel but a B and B at best. There are no communal areas to sit in apart from the breakfast room and the terrace overlooking the canal, no turn down service or room service and no complimentary water in the room. Our bedroom adjacent to the breakast room was large but very dark and depressing as the curtains had to remain closed so that other guests sitting on the terrace couldn't see directly into the room, and for the same reason external shutters were closed early evening until mid morning - why pay for a view and then be deprived of it!. The room was sometimes cold and when I asked at the desk for some heating in our room at 5 pm I was told that it was not the policy of the hotel to have the heating on in summer (it is mid April!) and was offered more blankets and pillows. The bed consisted of 2 twins put together with a ridge down the middle, not a criminal offence but ROCK HARD and the pillows , although plenty of them were lumpy. One of the brothers /owners arranged for extra blankets to be laid on top of the mattress but it was still very uncomfortable and I didn't have the guts to admit it when asked if there had been any improvement. . Breakfast- very ordinary. I love a good selection of freshly prepared fruits but not here- we had a choice of whole apples pears and kiwi ( not forgetting the tinned peaches) so on our third morning we asked for an orange and in all fairness we were brought an orange or two on subsequent mornings. For 400 euros a night I would have expected freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast and also freshly baked bread with delicious pastries but my expectations must be higher than most of other reviewers. Roasalba the waitress was a delight - we had great coffees and the omelettes and crepes looked appetizing but why not make the buffet table more appealing? I do feel guilty writing all this because the staff/owners were so accommodating when we saw them and seemed genuinely concerned that we should enjoy our stay there.

Arriving via water taxi from the airport right to the hotel entrance is quite easy and effortless and takes away any concerns with having to navigate through Venice's cobblestone streets with your luggage. The hotel itself is quite charming and really has a lot of personality. The front entrance is down a quiet little side street and the hotel is furnished and decorated with lots of personal touches. The location is superb and allows easy access into all of Venice's great neighborhoods. It is a stone's throw away from the Rialto Bridge and the outside terrace overlooks the Grand Canal and the bridge. The rooms are nice and clean and the bathrooms are spacious. Our particular room did not have a view but honestly, that was not an issue for us. We do not vacation to spend time in a hotel room so the vast majority of our day was out exploring all that Venice has to offer. When we wanted to sit and relax and people watch along the canal, we sat outside on the main terrace of the hotel enjoying an afternoon coffee. Speaking of the coffee, the hotel's custom built espresso machine makes the absolute finest espresso and cappuccino that we have ever had. It is truly a work of art and made mostly every other coffee we had during the rest of our trip pale in comparison. The owners, Bruno and Matteo, along with the rest of the hotel staff are truly special. They really make you feel like family and are so helpful with sightseeing and restaurant recommendations. They make your stay in Venice feel like you are staying with friends/family and the personal level of service was unmatched compared to other hotels we have stayed at in Europe. We were only at the beginning of our vacation in Italy but we were sad to leave Venice and I cried as the water taxi whisked us away from the Ponte Antico and took us to the train station while Bruno waved us goodbye.

Had done quite a bit of research, and I guess I expected to be more bowled over than I was, merely based on everyone's reviews. It's true that nearly everything is fairly perfect: ideal location just steps from the Rialto Bridge, majestic common area/dining room (from 14th or 15th century, I think), good breakfast, attentive service from quite possibly the nicest people in all of Venice. The room is where I think the standard fell just a little short - we had the most basic of rooms and nothing was wrong with it at all, decent size with ample and nice furnishings, upholstered walls/curtains, comfortable bed, huge bathroom...it was very dark, which is great for sleeping but a little disorienting during the day, maybe only a concern if you like to lounge around your room a lot, and the room was immediately off the dining area where breakfast is served. In fact, at least 3 or 4 of the 9 rooms seem to be. Again, we had a baseline priced room so this may just be what's to be expected, but we were very nervous about noise in the morning when people would be dining.

The bathroom was well-equipped, with robes and slippers, which was great, only a shampoo/body wash combo for amenities (pet peeve of mine; maybe I'm uppity but I think a four star hotel should have a body lotion and/or hair conditioner), and the only really unfortunate thing was the shower head would not stay up so you had to use it as a handheld. If we spent more than one day there, would certainly have said something, but basically - room 3 needs just a little servicing!

Looking through all the well known luxury hotels I was disconcerted by the number of reports of poor service that guests received. I selected this hotel based on its good service reviews and then hoped for the best. Luckily we weren't disappointed. We caught a water taxi from Marco Polo airport to the hotel. This a great way to arrive. First impressions were good, with Oliver taking great care to make us feel welcome. The hotel itself is small, with only 9 rooms. We booked a junior suite, overlooking the Grand Canal. The room was a resonable size and pleasantly decorated. Its main downside was the bathroom, which was very 'cosy' with a small shower cubicle and a shower that only delivered warm (rather than hot) water. I enjoyed the view over the Grand Canal and agree with other writers' comments that it's a pity the Rialto Bridge is covered in graffitti. Obviously that not the hotel's fault! Positives of the hotel are: - The staff. They are outstanding at their jobs and provide the sort of welcome that all small hotels should offer. - Location. Overlooking the Grand Canal and in such close proximity to the Rialto Bridge. - The breakfast/bar area. There is a nice small buffet in the mornings and they also cook pancakes and omelettes to order. - The building and its decor. There aren't really many negatives.

The windows of Room 102 open directly onto a slightly-blindered view of the Grand Canal (see photo of view from room) while the windows of the other Deluxe room on this floor, Room 101, have more panoramic views of the Grand Canal but look out directly onto the breakfast patio where people congregate in the morning and afternoons/evenings for drinks. Personally we preferred the privacy of Room 102 since we spent quite a bit of time mornings and afternoons on the breakfast patio to enjoy the panoramic views of the Rialto Bridge and up the Grand Canal. Room 104 is a darker room, overlooking the entrance to the hotel at the end of a narrow alley. Both rooms were very clean and had high ceilings. The bathroom in 102 is small and the shower a little tight but the ceiling is high and the shower itself was great. The bathroom in 104 is bigger, but due to the architecture of the building the ceiling over the tub/shower is really low (definitely less than 6 feet). Both rooms had ample closet space but not a lot of drawer space. We really did not think the beds were too hard per other reviews, and the rooms are quiet at night \u00e2\u20ac\u201cwe had no problem sleeping. The only thing I did not love about the rooms was something that did not bother the rest of the family and is not something I have seen mentioned in other reviews, so maybe I am very sensitive, but I personally found that the smell of the cleaning products used in the rooms was somewhat overwhelming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not an antiseptic/bleach or citrusy scent, but more of a heavily perfumed scent that gave me a headache. Perhaps it would have dissipated if we had kept the windows open, but it was just so very hot and humid outside that we really could not do that. During our stay, Oliviero, who introduced himself to the kids as Oliver, really took us under his wing and gave us directions and recommendations (and me Italian lessons, which I desperately needed). He is very engaging and the kids loved him. Also Rosalba was incredibly sweet and attentive at breakfast. A short walk over the Rialto Bridge we had the best dinner of our trip to Italy at Al Paradiso, on Calle Paradiso \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great lambchops and the best seafood risotto ever, and a minor celebrity sighting - Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank from Home Alone)!", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cMost amazing time\u201d", "Author": "goodtrips01", "ReviewID": "UR118156074", "Content": "This was my family's (husband and parents) third time to Venice.

We were met immediately by David and the owner: Matteo. They took care of our luggage (and we had plenty since this was a cruise vacation), they showed us to our room, and then proceeded to show us to the most fantastic part of the hotel--the patio area looking out over the grand canal and the Rialto Bridge. My visit to Venice could have been fine had I just stayed on that patio watching all the business of the grand canal sipping fine wine or cappuccinos. One thing I have to add is to splurge and take a water taxi to the hotel. You will love the scenery along the way. The hotel has its own private dock, so you are transported directly to the hotel. Unless you want to wander around the small walking streets of Venice with your luggage in tow, you will not regret the water taxi route. The room was large and had a great view of the canal. We felt somewhat like we were living back in the victorian era. The bathroom was small, but had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable, especially after walking the streets of Venice. Matteo and staff were always attentive and friendly. The recommendation they gave for dinner was fabulous. We would have never thought to go to the small restaurant thinking a place on the canal would have been preferred. The breakfast was a feast! Made to order eggs, hot & cold food, fresh fruit and delicious cappuccinos. We definitely ate plenty to get us through the strolls around Venice and St. Mark's Square.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I can adequately articulate the fabulousness of this hotel, its employees, and their very warm hospitality. The hotel's location is conveniently close to the Rialto Bridge but tucked away at the end of a quiet side street. The hotel has a private dock which made for easy arrival and departure via water taxi. We splurged and booked the Junior Suite, which has a large window that opens to the Grand Canal. This view is amazing! You are right on the water and have the best view of the Rialto Bridge and all the activity on the Grand Canal. The Junior Suite is quite large with a nice sitting area and desk by the window. The bathroom was a bit narrow and our room's walls seemed thin but these two issues were not enough of a bother to deter us from staying here again.

They all went above and beyond to make our stay a special one. Because it was our honeymoon, we were treated to a bottle of prosecco, which we enjoyed on our first night as we gazed out at our window at a moonlit Rialto Bridge and listened to the sounds of the passing boats and gondolas and the waves lapping against the hotel. Mateo was also so nice as to mail some letters for us back to the US. I think the best memories for us, which my husband and I still talk about, were those mornings spent on the terrace enjoying the most lovely breakfast in full view of the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. Mateo's omelets were delicious, as was the rest of the buffet of fresh fruits, pastries, yogurts, etc. And sweet Rosalba always made sure my coffee cup was full.

I came home and started to write a glowing review and then (selfishly) decided that I wanted to keep this special place to myself . Clearly not everyone felt like me and hence its high ratings. The position of this hotel is fantastic over looking the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. To arrive in the early evening (just as the lights are coming on) by water taxi is absolutely magical, just like stepping back in time. The taxi from the airport is not cheap but it is worth it as it is MUCH faster than the water bus and a great way to see part of the grand canal.On arrival you pull up to the front of the Hotel and are treated like honoured guests. The decor is typically Venetian...stunning! Not all the rooms have a canal view but this does not matter at all as the balcony is where you can have a drink, eat breakfast and if you are there for the first Sunday in September watch the regatta.

One of the recommended restaurants in particular, and about 2 minutes from the Hotel, was excellent. It is Barababao and has lovely efficient but friendly staff, including the Owner. Fish dishes are great and the value very good, including the wines. There were however some disappointments with the Hotel. WiFi reception was very intermittent and access expired every 24 hours. This was quite annoying. The hot breakfast was brilliant as you could order any style of eggs, including choice of omelettes Also very nice cappucinnos. Unfortunately the choice of fruit was very poor, with one variety only of tinned fruit and a very small selection of whole fruit. Nothing really to have with your cereal. We ended up buying our own fruit at shops. There was also a very limited range of cereals. A better breakfast would be expected of such a high class Hotel. Staff at breakfast were extremely friendly. The great bar area, where breakfast is held in the mornings is always available. However, despite the fact that there is always someone available to pour you a drink or coffee, you may receive a shock when you pay your room bill at the end. The extras, ie drinks and coffee, mount up and you are not aware of the cost when you have them. Often the front desk is unattended as the receptionist may be upstairs pouring drinks in the bar or elsewhere. We noticed this when we arrived as the water taxi driver went inside to find someone to help with our bags but it took some time to find someone. The driver was not impressed. Also inconvenient when you return to the Hotel and have to wait for someone to appear so you can retrieve your key. Our room in general was clean, but the first day we noticed small pieces of glass on the floor and rug. Despite notifying staff there were still pieces there when we departed several days later. Meant wearing shoes the entire time. We loved the Hotel and would definitely stay again, just that a few minor improvements would improve the Hotel to match the high tariff and the Hotel's rating.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amherst, NH", "Title": "\u201cThe Best!\u201d", "Author": "BethAmherst_NH", "ReviewID": "UR113444743", "Content": "I agree with all that has been said here.

Nothing was more relaxing than having breakfast or a snack out here and watch the gondolas and canal traffic right next to you. All the canal-view rooms were booked (there are only a few rooms with the canal view) but I would certainly try to book one if you can. We booked a private water taxi to arrive and depart from the hotel with our luggage, and I advise this to avoid the hassle of trying and find the front (or back?) entrance from the alleyway. Not all hotels in Venice are easily accessible to all boats from the water, but this hotel is. In such a large tourist city, we knew we could count on the staff of the hotel to be our advocates and take care of us. They were disciplined in greeting us by our names (and I got to know all of their names too) and always went \"the extra mile\" to please us and resolve any questions or problems. Need to find the status of a specific gallery? No problem. They even offered a cup of coffee to our guides that came to pick us up. As I was bringing an aged parent, they made sure to give us a room on the ground (floor \"0\") to avoid stairs. The included breakfast included eggs to order, canned juices, yogurt, various pastries, fruit and coffee. The layout probably differs from room to room, but we found the organization a bit difficult to maneuver around; the room was not large in the first place and there was very little room for positioning luggage in a convenient place. Repositioning one or two pieces of furniture along one wall would have been helpful to us. The bathroom was very large with great fixtures. Our room needed a lot of small repairs. For instance, our room was classic Venetian with fabric damask wallpaper, Persian rugs and murano glass sconces. However, the a/c unit vibrated and even chirped like a cricket at times, so I put my overnighter on top to one side to apply pressure and stop it. Also, the a/c blower barely worked but it was sufficient to keep the room from becoming stifling. The main flush pad on the toilet was broken; we made do with the \"little\" flush. Some of the towels, bathrobes and sheets were getting pretty old, but were clean. There were some 1\" holes in the wallpaper next to the bathroom door, possibly from some attachment that had been taken off the wall. There was some mold starting to grow on the rim of the shower stall floor and it needed a good scrubbing or recaulking. There were some services I am used to that were not available. There are no english TV stations provided, but we were provided with free wireless which \"usually\" worked from the room and got our CNN/BBC news through my iPhone (!!) using Slingbox. They also do not normally provide laundry services, but the marvelous staff found a local service and got it done for me (I was desperate). This is not a grand 5-star hotel like the Danieli where we stayed the last time. But we believe we received a more authentic experience based on hotel and location to get a more intimate portrait of Venice. Despite the small shortcomings, staying in this charming villa with caring staff was a great experience that greatly enhanced our stay in Venice. And did I mention how wonderful breakfast on the outside terrace is?", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cThe best service I have ever encountered from any hotel in the world\u201d", "Author": "GlennKent", "ReviewID": "UR113081255", "Content": "Words cannot describe just what an unbelievable pleasure it was to stay at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel for our wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived Matteo and his team treated us like royalty - a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket on rose petals with a lovely note signed by the staff was waiting for us in our room. Matteo, the owner was always absolutley charming. We were consistently treated as though we were the only guests staying in the hotel, nothing was too much for them to do for us. On the few times we saw other guests (it only has 9 rooms) I noticed that they treated everyone in exactly the same way. The hotel itself is quite simply beautiful - the attention to detail is amazing and you feel like you are living in an authentic Venitian Palace. We stayed in a Superior Room (101) with ridiculously high ceilings and fantastic views of the Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge - I would imagine you would need to stay in at least a SR to ensure the views although you would need to check with the hotel. Location is in my view, perfect (about 6 minute walk to St Marks Sq) and the view from the terrace is sensational (nothing better than a cold beer while admiring the views after a long day of walking around town). Once you get your bearings and learn the short cuts, you will be very impressed with how quickly you can reach other parts of the city in just a short walk. I religously use Trip Adviser for selecting all hotels I stay at but can never be bothered to write a review afterwards - however, arrived home last night and felt I just had to write something, it was that good. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. If you are going to Venice, stay here. I think it would be impossible for anyone not to rank this hotel as one of the best hotel experiences anywhere in the world.

I really think it's the best way to get to the hotel, and at 100 Euro from the airport, let's face it, if you are staying here, you can probably afford that cost too! Secondly, the staff are all brilliantly trained, very friendly and helpful. The owner, Matteo is quite possibly the most elegant man I've ever met, with his perfectly tailored clothes, exquisite manners and flawless grooming. I am sure he charms everyone he meets. His staff range in age and personality, but are all lovely. In particular Tomaso at night, was always welcoming and with a quick wit, entertained us greatly. Oliver is a charming young man who seems to know everything there is to know about his home town, and is so friendly and accommodating, he also makes a really great spritz. Rosalba is there at the breakfast room every morning with a smile and a coffee, she's just adorable. The breakfast room is quite simply, spectacular, it's like nothing I've seen before, comfortable, luxurious and perfectly appointed. The terrace is such a lovely area, we spent way too much time there photographing the view, watching the world go by and drinking Oliver and Matteo's brilliant spritzs. We stayed for a full week, and I think that most people don't get the opportunity to stay such a long time, and so we really got to know the staff after the scripting was done with. They may seem a little practiced to some, but they are all there to help and make your stay as memorable as possible. The room we stayed in was large and comfortable. I wasn't particularly thrilled with the bed, it was a bit hard, but nothing that would stop me from staying again. The bathroom was nicely done, small, but perfectly fine. Yes, the ceiling is low, but this is a really old building, so that is to be expected, surely. Probably the only things that I would change if the hotel asked me to, would be the strange, laminate sliding door to the bathroom, which I thought really distracted from the lovely fabric wrapped walls, and the fact that the television was positioned so that the cords were dragged a way from the power point. Not anything major. I wasn't particularly enamoured by the restaurant suggestions, but then, I am from a Sicilian family, and the food of the north is probably just not what I'm used to. There is a lovely little cake store at the end of the lane where the hotel is situated that have some delicious treats. The coffee is so-so, but the food is really lovely. Overall, I loved this hotel, I would stay again, and Matteo is completely correct, I do miss Venice. I dream of it and count the days until I can return.

We met others onboard our cruise that were not able to arrive at their pier due to the rising water, the water taxi could not fit under, and they ended up dragging luggage for several blocks and over bridges. Definetly not a good experience, especially if you paid for water taxi service. Never would have occured to me....

Dark, dingy, smelly, no pictures or decorations on the walls whatsoever, slightly weird furniture, a down-at-heel feeling and a very basic bed. But large without question. The bathroom was pretty poor considering the very high prices charged, and certainly in need of updating. Breakfast is very good. Drinking prosecco on the balconey overlooking the Rialto Bridge is matchless. The Perruchi family need to spend some of the money that they are clearly putting in to marketing into renovation and upgrading. If they can do that, they'll have a truly fine hotel.

The owner and staff could not be more attentive and the hotel's location is perfect. My wife and I are frequent visitors to Venice and I'm sure we shall be staying there again in the not too distant future. However, there is one comment I would make that travellers with a long stay or part of a large family might find useful. This is a small hotel and the owner plus his excellent staff make a point of knowing the names of every guest. And my point concerns the ordering (and ultimately paying for) the drinks. Nothing is much more pleasurable in life than sitting on the hotel terrace with a drink and watching the life on the Grand Canal. One orders one's drink, which is duly brought. And that is it. No bill is presented for signing. Nor is there any price list so you don't know how much your drinks have cost - apart from the fact that just about everything in Venice will be more expensive than you expect! My wife and I were there for five nights and had, as far as I remember, 13 drinks between us, four of which were beers. But when we came to pay our bill all we were given was a hand-written invoice totally lacking in any detail apart from the single amount of just over 100 euros. This I found slightly unsettling and it explained a comment I had overheard by a previous party who checked out before us. I am certainly not suggesting that we were intentionally overcharge - in fact, I'm not suggesting we were overcharged at all even though I have no idea how much the different drinks cost. But mistakes can happen. Coincidentally on this same trip we found ourselves mistakenly charged at a nearby restaurant for the wine and water ordered by the British couple on the adjacent table. This was easily spotted, of course, because the bill was fully detailed. As I say, mistakes can happen. So I would suggest to future guests to ask for a price list of the drinks, which I'm sure will be willingly provided. You will then know what you are letting yourself in for when it comes to the time to pay the bill and could even spot any error. Personally I would prefer the simple method of just signing a chit, which is standard procedure, and then these chits will be clipped to your bill.

He is so proud of his city and the hotel, and his pride and enthusiasm for all things Venetian just made us love Venice even more. Matteo's recommendations for dining were absolutely excellent; he kept us close to the hotel on our first day which was wise since we were not quite as familiar with the city and then recommended a great restaurant for us that was a little further away one our second night there. It is true that the staff knows you by name from the moment you dock and never talk to you without using it, which is a wonderful personal touch. Their English is excellent --at the conversational levels. Even Thomas the night guard kept my 13 and 15 year old laughing during our entire stay. The service combined with the location truly makes this hotel a dream come true. Location, location, location--I cannot tell you how truly marvelous the location of this hotel is. While it is on the grand canal, there is no noise at all to interrupt your stay as the shutters are quite thick. It's easy to walk to St. Mark's from this hotel; there is no schlepping bags through Venice trying to find your hotel and getting hopelessly lost as they have their own docking station; there are great shops with everything you can possibly imagine right on the main \"street\" by the hotel; and you can always find your way back without any problems because you simply follow the signs that say \"Per Rialto.\" The little terrace patio overlooking the canal is simply divine and we spent as much time there as possible. The rooms are nicely appointed and the beds are quite comfortable. Breakfast is delicious-- besides the typical Italian fare, you can also choose a fresh omelette with eggs handpicked from Matteo's grandmother, or delicious crepes.

We arrived by water taxi at the hotels own entrance from the Grand Canal, at the recommendation of Matteo, who I had spoken to before we arrived. He also made a reservation for us at a fantastic restaurant for the night of our arrival, as it was a Saturday and we had heard that it might be difficult to get into restaurants if you hadn't booked on the weekends. His courteous and friendly manner set the tone for the whole trip. The staff were always happy to help you, whether advising on where to go around Venice, or serving a wonderful glass of wine in the evening, enjoying the view of the rialto from the sitting area. Breakfast was enjoyable, always plentiful and Matteo's famous egg dishes were cooked to perfection. The loction of the hotel is great, every important site easily accessible by a few minutes walk, and arriving down the Grand Canal makes you feel like a VIP. There are even umbrellas to borrow, as it rained for 2 of the 4 days we were there, at least we got to walk on the raised platforms! The rooms are decorated to a very high standard and always clean, we stayed in a classic room. The only niggle could be that they are slightly on the small side, but please do not be put off. I've heard most of Venices hotel rooms are like this and you don't spend that much time there as you've got the wonderful city to explore. Overall, this is a FANTASTIC place to stay, I would recommend it to all my friends and the praise for Matteo is deserved. He was helpful when needed, talked to us to keep us company if that was required and left us to ourselves when we wanted it.

We flew in from Chicago and were very jet lagged when we arrived but just being in the water taxi on the way to the hotel woke us up and revived us. If you're trying to decide on transportation, I would definitely pay the extra money for the water taxi. (We chose to forgo the gondola ride because we felt the water taxi was just as good an experience.) Pulling up to the hotel, I could not believe that it truly was right on the Grand Canal. No matter how many times I read the reviews, I still didn't believe it was right on the Grand Canal AND right by the Rialto Bridge. Truly a fabulous location. And the service?! Oliver was like our own personal bartender, tour guide, history teacher, and host. He was so sweet and made us feel so comfortable. And we loved Matteo, as well. He made some of the best eggs we had ever had for breakfast one morning. He had gotten them from his mother's farm. And the room you sit in for breakfast is just gorgeous. By far the best breakfasts we had in Italy. We were only there for two nights and we so did not want to leave. We spent a lot of time on the balcony sipping on spritzs, bellinis and wine watching the boats go by. The balcony was the perfect escape because Venice is so busy; it was nice to have an \"oasis\" to come back to after a day of walking. Don't get me wrong, though. We loved the \"busy-ness\" of Venice. Walking out of the hotel and into the hustle & bustle of the streets of Venice was so fun. And the fact that there are no cars makes it so enjoyable. Like some of the other reviews, we did not get a room on the canal but we were totally fine with that because we spent so much time on the balcony. Our room was so quiet and relaxing. We loved it. And we had a great little view of a rooftop garden next store. I want to go back and spend at least 5 days there. And I will come with no itinerary because Oliver and Matteo have the best recommendations. I highly, highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fabulous place to stay in Venice!", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hartford, ct", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "majik48", "ReviewID": "UR49612377", "Content": "The level of personal service I experienced during my stay has completely changed my perception of how a hotel should take care of its guests.

Matteo lived up to his reputation as I walked in the door with six of my friends. He had memorized our pictures from the passports we left at check in and knew each of us by name, as did his staff as we met them during our stay. The hotel is lovely. Two of the three rooms we had booked had beautiful views of the canal - unfortunately ours only had a view of an inside alcove of some sort. This is the only critique I would make is to ask ahead of time what the view is if this is important to you. We felt completely at home here, spending a great deal of time in the beautiful room where they served breakfast. And the breakfast and coffee service was 5 star. Matteo can cook but word to the wise - don't walk around with your coffee cup - as I was informed of my \"American\" nature - coffee is to be enjoyed sitting in Italy and not \"to go\" as we do in the US - good advice! Matteo made many arrangements for us including a private tour of one of the Murano glass factories and water taxi back to airport). On check out day we were not due to leave until nearly six.

This was our pre-dinner ritual for both evenings we were there, and both mornings we ate breakfast in the same spot, though the breakfast room is so gorgeous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the things I fell in love with in the photos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that it was almost a shame not to eat there one morning. However, we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pass up a breakfast on the balcony for it! My husband and I so enjoyed seeing so much of Venice life passing by us boat: the ambulance (which made a wake that overflowed the opposite bank), the mailman, the express mail, the laundry service, a boat with a wheelbarrow in it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you name it! The breakfast was the best of any of our six hotels in three countries. In addition to a selection of items that were already beautifully laid out on the table, Matteo cooked eggs or omelets to order (and he told us, as he has others, that the eggs came from his grandmother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm) and/or Italian crepes. We were there two mornings, and on neither one could I resist the banana and chocolate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crepe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They were also very generous with as many delicious cappuccinos as we cared to drink. I stopped at three. (As elsewhere in Italy, the cups are tea-cup size. I never could find a venti!) We were in Room #103, right across from the breakfast bar. I was afraid the noise of breakfast prep would wake us up, but we never heard a sound. Pros for Room #103. First of all, it is beautifully appointed. The very high walls (maybe 15 feet?) are upholstered in damask, per the photos. The draperies, cornice board and bedspread are in a coordinating striped damask. The woods in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in the furniture and in the door, mouldings, etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are gorgeous. Even the mini-bar is in an antique (or antique looking) cabinet. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stunning chandelier (I assume it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Murano) and matching sconces. If you check the view from Room #103, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see that it overlooks an alley, but if you like architectural details, you owe it to yourself to push back the sheers and check out the leaded-glass windows. The bathroom is probably the largest we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in Europe. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you could dance in it! And it has old, old ceiling beams and a bidet and spa tub. Cons for Room #103: The room is cramped for the person who sleeps on the far side of the bed. My husband twice stubbed his toe on the mini-bar cabinet, which is at the foot of the bed. Perhaps the biggest short-coming though (no pun intended), is the low ceiling height over the tub. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primarily because the tub is raised (maybe because of out-dated spa-jet equipment under it?). So between the raised tub and a bathroom ceiling that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to begin with, it was difficult for my husband to shower there. I doubt the bathroom has been remodeled since the 60s. Given the high standards Matteo has brought to the hotel, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t surprise me if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a to-do list as time and funds are available. This hotel has the best-trained staff we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever experienced anywhere. Every time we encountered a different staff member, they would introduce themselves. And everyone was constantly calling us by name. Matteo has done an impressive job of management, and no doubt that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the major reasons why the hotel is ranked #1 for Venice on Trip Advisor. Matteo is all the things people have said about him. However, a problem about continual raves is that it can tend to elevate people in our minds to something beyond the human realm, then we are taken aback if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live up to that every moment. That happened to me with a comment Matteo made. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a professional photographer, though a very few of my photos have been published, but photography is a serious hobby. So naturally, I took a number of photos as we were sitting on the balcony, and also a few in the beautiful breakfast/bar area (not when other guests were eating). Matteo made the comment that I would go back and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153torture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd my friends by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making them look at all those pictures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was taking. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if he meant to insult my photography or my manners. ;) I explained that I greatly weed through them first and then, feeling somewhat defensive I guess, added, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People tell me they want to see my pictures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are kind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I felt the comments were not worthy of him. (When I related this to my husband, he teased me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blown it now!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ;)) But perhaps it only goes to prove that even Matteo is human. Some Tips Parking: Based on the research my husband did, the Piazzale Roma is considered the safest place to park, and since we were leaving some of our luggage in the trunk, that was important to us. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to reserve a spot online ahead of time. Vaporetto vs. water taxi: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it would be worth the extra money to take the water taxi, as we thought the Rialto Bridge would be close enough for us to pull our luggage, and we were there in mid-October (i.e., not in the thick of the tourist season). But since so many people said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a hard time finding the hotel, we thought we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d at least do the water taxi for the arrival. What a great way to get your first views of Venice! Then we saw the vaporettos go by. People were packed inside them! We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what it would be like to try to get on one of them with our luggage. So needless to say, we took a water taxi on the return as well. (We were told it should cost EUR 55 to/from the parking lot, but be sure to agree on the price ahead of time.) Conclusion When we booked this hotel, it was $400/night. Because we were in Europe for almost three weeks, it took some persuading to get my husband to agree to that. I let the TA reviews do the talking for me, and because of the incredible raves for this hotel, he was won over. By the time we took the trip (we were there in mid-October), the dollar had declined to the point that it was about $450/night, making it the most we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever paid for a hotel. Are we glad we chose Al Ponte Antico Hotel? Absolutely!! Having fallen in love with the place through Trip Advisor, it would have been a huge disappointment for me not to stay there. I would have always felt we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d missed something that we would never be able to recapture. But maybe even more importantly, when I look back in retrospect on our trip to Venice, the first thing I think of is sitting on that balcony for afternoon spritzes (by the way, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re EUR 7 each for a generous size) and for our leisurely breakfasts each morning; watching dusk fall on the canal at the end of each day, and all the boat traffic (with deliveries of every kind!) in the mornings. The price is high, but it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be cheap to stay anywhere in Venice, and the difference in price was (I thought) worth it for the enhanced experience. If you agree, you may want to consider booking as many months ahead as possible. When you only have nine rooms, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ranked #1 in Trip Advisor, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long to fill up.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cMagical place\u201d", "Author": "MrsZutterbug", "ReviewID": "UR47738337", "Content": "This hotel exceeded my expectations and made my stay in Venice truly magical.

If you're undecided about how to transfer to your hotel from the airport, and you can afford your own water taxi, just do it. We were greeted at the hotel's landing stage by a very welcoming Tommaso who, like all the other staff, welcomed us by name before we'd had a chance to introduce ourselves...how do they all manage to do that?! Our room, which was large and comfortable, overlooked the hotel terrace which itself fronts onto the Grand Canal. It took us a little time to get used to the fact that our room overlooked the terrace, which other guests used, but we found that we loved having it on our doorstep and it often felt like our own. The view up and down the canal from the terrace is amazing, especially in the evening and at night.

In the mornings we would take our time to savour the ample buffet breakfast and I always seemed to find a little bit more room for some of Matteo's delicious scrambled eggs or an omelette. Then off we would go to explore Venice for the day - the hotel is very central and St Mark's is less than 10 minutes away - before heading back to the hotel to relax, ask Matteo to recommend another restaurant, or get ready to see a concert. The hotel itself is lovely and well situated - there are not many rooms and this makes for an intimate and personal stay - but it is the staff that are the heart and soul of the place and they alone make it easily the best hotel we've ever stayed in. Matteo, the owner, is the most charming man you'll ever meet and, dare I say it, a complete perfectionist, who spends a lot of time at the hotel and who is totally dedicated to the guests and staff within it. Oliver and Tommaso are wonderful characters who we really enjoyed spending time with and who would provide us with whatever we needed. We had a real soft spot for Rosa who treated us like royalty at breakfast. I do not mention others only because our paths crossed very infrequently. Thank you all for a wonderful start to our honeymoon.

I made the booking directly with the hotel and they responded immediately the whole process of booking was made so easy, plus our subsequent emails with requests for them to recommend restaurants and booking dinner reservations were all answered with great efficiency.

The hotel is in a very conveniant area close enough to the Rialto bridge, and only a ten minute walk to St. Marks Square but away from all the hustle and bustle that is Venice, also very near the Vap stops, which made getting out and about very easy. I must also mention that on our return to the hotel each evening after dinner Thomas would make me a delicious cappuccino with a Zambucca he was wonderful a big thank you Thomas for making the end of our days in Venice so memorable sitting on that wonderful balcony watching all the activities on the Grand Canal just perfect. Matteo told us that he has bought another hotel in Tuscany, which I can't wait to visit once the renovations are completed if it is half as good as the Al Ponte Antico it will be fantastic One final thing on the day of our departure which was our 25th Wedding Anniversary my Husband had organized with Matteo to deliver a bottle of Processco to our room which he did and then we enjoyed the rest of it with our leisurely breakfast before departing by water taxi to the train station for the 2nd leg of our Italian tour to Lake Garda.

Its not a hotel in the traditional sense, more like a bed and breakfast establishment. Its small, dark and a bit of a rabbit warren with a dungeon like feel. We had 2 rooms, junior suite and standard. The bathrooms were disappointingly cramped with low ceilings, small showers, no bath in the junior suite. Towels were thin and could be a bit grubby. There were plastic cups. Some of the lights weren't functioning. They had the feeling of cabin bathrooms in a caravan park. Most disappointing. The junior suite was large with some nice antiques. The beds were hard and pillows lumpy. I had to ask for another pillow which I received. The suite room opened onto the grand canal which is their main thoroughfare, therefore noisy, busy and smelly. Result couldn't open window. Same for the standard room which was almost internal. This room was so dark the lights had to be on all day and window couldn't be opened due to hideous smell like sewer/drains in the lane. Not the hotels fault of course. Both rooms were dark and depressing, despite ours being large there was still a claustrophobic feel. It was impossible to use the rooms for reading, relaxation or respite as too dark and depressing. The common areas consist of a bar/breakfast room which is not airconditioned and a terrace over the canal. Both of these areas were so hot (we went in July) that it was uncomfortable. We were immediately sweating. I understand however that this is Venice in July. I would have thought a 4 star hotel would have aircon in common areas though. Please note this room is nicely furnished and has a desk with computer access. In summary there was nowhere to relax and get out of the heat and the crowds of venice as common areas too hot and bedrooms too depressing. Note also that at this time of year Venice is very hot and overcrowded that it can be an unpleasant experience. Not the hotels fault also. The hotel just happens to be located in the busiest area. Despite this we still managed to have late afternoon drinks in the bar or on the terrace. The wine was good, there were no nibbles served except for soggy chips. Their restaurant recommendations were quite good, although we all got sick in the stomach. Staff. Other trip advisors are more positive. We felt invaded. Yes they are super friendly and know your names which they use all the time and yes you get the spiel about grandmothers eggs and lectures on lots of other subjects. Its all rehearsed, like they've memorised a script. You hear them saying the same things to everyone. You couldn't leave your room without someone talking at you. It was quite creepy and invasive. Perhaps this type of intimacy suits some travellers but we prefer restrained contact and a little more anonimity. We needed to leave a day early and despite giving 2 days notice we were charged for the 2 rooms in full. Staff said instead of deducting from the bill this time that we could have a credit when we came again. If we were getting a nights credit why not just deduct it when we were there? Very odd!! Note there is no room service to speak of. To put this report in perspective please note we are well travelled and hotels we stayed in for this year's trip were San Regis Paris, Egerton House in London, Rome Cavillieri, Sacher Wien in Vienna and Villa Carlotta in Taormina.

Molly and I had met Matteo and Barbara, the owners, when we stayed for the first time about 6 years ago at their Locanda Orseolo Hotel (also very highly recommended) near St. Marks square, and had visited the Al Ponte Antico hotel just a few months after they had purchased it so no renovations had yet begun. Well, the renovations have been completed and are just stunning. The small, 9 room hotel has been completely refurbished in traditional Venetian style and it's just beautiful. The location is breathtaking, being on the Grand Canal about 200 meters from the Rialto Bridge. We never got tired of sitting on the second floor hotel patio in the morning watching all the delivery boats making their rounds, or in the afternoon watching the day trippers stream out of the city, and the gondolas making their evening rounds. The rooms are large and spacious and several have views of the Grand Canal. Matteo's breakfast omlettes and food selections are marvelous, and the full bar makes for a great cocktail hour watching the busy traffic on the Grand Canal. The staff reflects Matteo's philosophy of superb, friendly and efficient service and is just a delight. And being a native Venetian, Matteo is an encyclopedia of little visited sights in the city and wonderful, intimate restaurants easily within walking distance of the hotel. He is also passionate about his city, and it's impossible not to get caught up in his enthusiasm for this unique and fascinating city. This not the least expensive hotel in Venice, but the facility, the staff, and location are well worth the cost - one of those incredible experiences everyone should treat themselves to now and then.

We all arrived at the Al Ponte Antico and after checking us in, I asked Matteo if he could give us directions to my parents hotel. Instead of simply giving us the directions, he actually walked us to the other hotel over a series of bridges, down a street and a couple of alleys.

We were a little reticent to stay in a small hotel with a 4 star rating (by European standards!). But heartened by previous reviewers we took the plunge. And what a refreshing plunge it was! Hotel Al Ponte Antico is a small hotel - only 9 rooms. The room (Room #105) was furnished in typical Venetian style without being kitsch. The bedroom was about 20-23sq metres not including the bathroom which was a little small but modern & bright and had good facilities. There was a couch, coffee table, davenport with large drawers, cabinet with w fridge/minibar, and wardrobe with drawers. It had more than adequate storage. There was adequate lighting but not a lot of light from the windows which faced onto other buildings - everything is closely situated in Venice. The room was very quiet. However on 2 days there was a dull intermittent thumping which appeared to be coming from somewhere outside the hotel (not the fault of the hotel) but did not create a substantial problem. There is a computer connected to the internet . WiFi is available within the hotel at no charge. The staff really make the place. The owner Matteo (over whom the females of all ages go a little gah gah), his team of helpers Armando, Oliver, Tomasso & David together with the ancillary staff, Rosalba & Ines make you extremely welcome. Nothing is too much. They are really concerned that your stay is A1+++. I discovered one of the 2 aircon units in the room was not working; it was repaired the following day. Addressing is by first names. The atmosphere is informal and very friendly and being such a small hotel the guests all talk to each other (people used to do that 40-50 years ago....)adding to the experience. Wait till you breakfast on the terrace outside the bar/breakfast room overlooking the Grande Canal and the Rialto Bridge which I estimate is less than 150m away! And the breakfasts were great with Matteo doubling as breakfast chef to do the eggs the way you want them. The location is great. It is on the southern edge of Canaregio, a 10-15 minute walk (ideally) to St Marks Square. Why Ideally? Because you will get waylaid in a shop or two or perhaps 150! If that doesn't happen then you get lost; but that is what you do in Venice - walk, get lost and discover new things! Wheeling luggage through Venetian streets, up and down bridges is for the young & fit without much luggage. Do yourself a favour: from the station take a water taxi (eu50 per taxi) or the airport (eu95 per taxi). If you can get up to six passengers, the price per head drops dramatically and for 6 people is less expensive than the public system which leaves you lugging your baggage. Expensive for 2 people? Yes! But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worth! The hotel has its own private water stop out the 'back' door which makes baggage handling a snap.

I could easily have sat there for hours. Second, the hotel's location is premium--nestled in a small and safe alley where noise is not a problem. St. Mark's Square is only a 5-10 minute walk away; Rialto Bridge and the fisherman market are 3-minutes away. Third, the rooms are spacious and extravagantly decorated.

No wonder this hotel is rated number 1 in Venice. It is a beautifully renovated 14th Century Palace , converted into a 9 room hotel. It is right on the grand Canal and there are amazing views from its lovely terrace. It is centrally located, you can see the Rialto Bridge from the hotel terrace and its a 10 minute walk to San Marks Square. It has its own mooring for arrival by water taxi from the airport, a great and convenient way to arrive and depart. But what makes this hotel special is its customer service. Its staff led by Matteo treat you like long lost friends. There is none of this false friendliness you see in other hotels. This is sincere and is some of the best customer service I have experienced in any hotel around the World. It all starts with Matteo. A charming and affable and multi lingual owner and host. Great company as you have a glass of Prosecco on the terrace. And by the way his Omelets are the best i have tasted. Only minor quibble is that room 2 was slightly noisy with noise coming from outside of the hotel early and latish, but I am a light sleeper. But this is minor when is considered with the total experience of 2 night stay. Finally if you fancy a special meal book a table at Osteria San marino nearby.

Matteo (the owner) and his staff (especially Oliver) run a tight ship, with no detail spared. They go out of their way to learn your names and to do whatever they need to make your stay wonderful. Our room (we had a junior suite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c room 108) was fabulous. Highly, highly recommended. Pros: Good location, incredible views, wonderful breakfasts (with eggs from Matteo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 98-year-old grandmother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm), certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience (though we hope to go back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and soon). Cons: Small hotel (9 rooms) so no big hotel services (i.e. room service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though they will bring drinks, tea and snacks to your room). This really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a con as there are, by definition, no large hotels in Venice. Some rooms have an interior view. Review: My wife and I stayed here as part of our honeymoon, it was simply unforgettable. We arrived in Venice by train from Rome, and took the Vaparetto (water bus) from the train station to the Rialto stop, and walked a short distance to the hotel. Venice, at first, seems like an impenetrable maze, so we had a small difficulty figuring out exactly how to locate the hotel from the Rialto stop. Luckily, we spotted the hotel from the water bus and knew which direction to head (see our photo so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll recognize it too). If you have bags, you may want to consider taking a water taxi from either the airport or the train station, because the streets of Venice are not friendly for bag dragging (they are narrow, sometimes crowded with tourists and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll encounter a couple of small sets of stairs between the Rialto stop and the hotel). The hotel has its own dock for the water taxis. Once we arrived at the hotel, Oliver (Matteo-the-owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right-hand man) greeted us. We went into our room and a bottle of champagne was waiting (see picture). We stayed in the junior suite, room 108, with a canal front room. And, as my wife says, we definitely had the best view in all of Venice (I agree). The room, the view and the experience was simply incredible, and unforgettable. Our pictures from and of the room (attached), do not do it full justice. The junior suite was very large, with a separate canal-front sitting area, with a huge, opening picture window. As our photos show, from the room you can watch the main street of Venice (i.e. the grand canal) and see the boats, Vaparetto, and gondolas all passing under the Rialto Bridge. The room was very clean and well appointed. You feel as if you are staying in a Venetian palace of yesteryear. The only negative was that the bathroom and shower were a bit small (see photo), but by no means did this detract from the overall wonderfulness of the room, the hotel or Venice. The hotel is centrally located, only a couple of blocks to the Rialto bridge. It is easy to walk from the hotel to St. Marks square as well. We recommend walking around on the back streets of Venice (i.e. away from the tourist areas) with the locals. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see an entirely different, and much quieter Venice. We also recommend taking a gondola ride (you are in Venice) and spending a couple of hours riding the Vaperetto through all of its stops (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best, and cheapest, way to see all of Venice from the water). For the gondola, we recommend interviewing a couple of different ones to find one that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to your liking, and picking one that is in a quiet area. The hotel is close to many wonderful dining options. Matteo, Oliver and the others are also willing to recommend non-touristy restaurants and make reservations for you. One night, we ate at a wonderful seafood place (as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect since Venice is on the water), only to find out that the owner was a fisherman with two of his very own boats, and is the president of the Venice Fish Market to boot. If you want wonderfully fresh and local seafood, make sure to ask Matteo or Oliver for a reservation. Matteo and his staff made us breakfast each morning, including wonderful coffee, cappuccino, pastries and eggs from Matteo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 98-year-old grandmother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm. See the attached photos of the breakfast area and Matteo in action making omelets. Off the breakfast area is a great terrace area overlooking the grand canal and the Rialto Bridge. If the junior suite is booked, or is too pricey for your budget, sitting on the terrace for breakfast, afternoon tea, or a pre/after-dinner drink is also a good way to appreciate the incredible location of this hotel. In conclusion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we highly recommend the Hotel Al Ponte Anico in Venice. We especially recommend requesting the canal-front, junior suite, room 108, for view and an experience you will never forget. Though we get first dibs. If Rome is in your travel plans, check out our review of the Hotel Artorius In Rome, which we also highly recommend. If you stay at the Hotel Al Ponte Anico, make sure to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Matteo and Oliver for us.

How they manage to remember everyone by name is beyond me! Also some points are given as I heard 2 members of staff switching between perfect English, French and German between guests. They also arranged a free water taxi ride to Murano, telling us it was to be the sort of thing where someone meets you and gives you a quick tour of their shop/factory in the hope you'll spend some money. So we thought why not... Someone met us as the taxi docked, so friendly! He gave us a lengthy and informative tour just for the two of us and put no pressure on us, not even a hint. We almost felt embarassed he was so nice there and the tour was probably my favourite thing we did in Venice! Anyway back to the hotel, our room was very nice, Venetian-style and ornate and beautiful. The bathroom was even better.

There is the regular cold items - cereal, cakes, fruit, crossiants, breads, cheese, cold cuts, crackers, yogurt, etc. And there are also warm items - ham and cheese stuffed crossiants, sausages, etc. And then there are made to order hot foods such as pancakes (crepes) and omlets. A perfect start to the day.

The room was insulated enough from noise at night and we were willing to put up with a little noise to be able to look out onto the Grand Canal whenever we wanted. Being on the Grand Canal also allows for direct transfers to and from the hotel by water taxi and eliminates lugging bags through the streets. The Hotel has a great view of the Rialto Bridge, but is a far enough walk away from the bridge, which is one of the more crowded areas in Venice. The central location allows easy access to all parts of the city either on foot or waterway. Our room was large and comfortable for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The bathroom was small but nice.

He is so passionate about the hotel (No Wonder!) and the city of Venice it is unbelievable. He wants you to truly enjoy and get the most out of your stay, both he and Oliver guided us constantly on the little map they gave us, as to where to go, the best times of day to visit places, and places to eat, even booking us into a restaurant on our first night, which was lovely (San Marco). Our room was beautifull, overlooking the Grand Canal, and just a few steps from the wonderfull terrace, where we spent many hours enjoying our 'Spritz' (delicious) and enjoying the fabulous view, all the people going by on the water buses look up at you , looking like they wish they were sat up there with you! We ended all our evenings on the terrace, where candles are lit all around, making it so romantic and special, to be honest we used to get back there at night and wonder why we ever went out in the first place!! It has to be the best spot in Venice. Matteo's omlettes are delicious, again served out on the terrace in the morning, he is always there to greet you and get you whatever you want. We have never known hospitality like it. The hotel is also ideally located, right in the centre, only 5 mins to St Mark's Square but just nicely out of the main crowds, to be honest everywhere is walkable in Venice, it is a pleasure to just wander down little alleyways, which bring you out at another lovely square with bars/restaurants etc, but the biggest pleasure was always having this wonderfull hotel to return to.

It used to be an old Venetian Palace and was painstakingly redone by the current owner Mattheo. Mattheo's family have been hoteliers for a long time and he is so passionate about making sure his guests have the best time. There are only 9 rooms and Mattheo and his crew will make you feel like you are the only guest at his wonderful palace. He makes the most delicious omelettes and crepes for you in the morning and don't miss the caffe from his handcrafted coffee machine ! Mattheo knows Venice inside out and gave us good tips - go early to St Mark's square before the day trippers arrive, don't miss the fish market, take the boat to the colourful village of Burano and have luch by the canal at Trattoria al Gatto Nero da Ruggero ( pasta with spider crab was delicious and grilled fresh sardines) .

Pros: Matteo, housekeeping and the night staff addressed my wife and me by name EVERY time they saw us. Matteo, being a man of effusive mien, never lets an opportunity for lengthy discussions on the wonders of Venetian life pass him by, is happy to supply recommendations for any activity and seems to have the water bus timetable memorized. Our room (non-suite, non-canal view, 280 Euro/night in late March 2008) was spotless and large for Venice, with vaulted ceilings and full-sized king bed. Our bathroom was also large, with a shower over a jet-fitted tub. Arriving by water taxi directly to the hotel's private dock on the Grand Canal is a great convenience and sets the mood, as does the porter running out to grab our bags whilst introducing himself (and somehow already knowing our names). The hotel's common area, the \"hall\", where breakfast & drinks (full bar) are served (and which leads to the outdoor terrace useful outside of winter) is beautiful. Matteo's Venetian spritzers are in fact good. One evening we went to the Gritti Palace for cocktails and tried their spritzer. On top of the Gritti seeming run-down and frankly a bit depressing, the drink wasn't nearly as piquant, voluminous, or inexpensive. It really made us think that we were getting a much better experience (way beyond the spritzer) at Ponte Antico and for almost a third the room rate (and half the cocktail rate). Cons: Matteo NEVER lets an opportunity for lengthy discussions on the wonders of Venetian life pass him by. Its charming, but sometimes we just want our room key or the tiniest bit of anonymity in our movements and activities. One annoying quirk, because our tub was raised a foot or two off the floor and the bathroom had low ceilings, at just 6'0 I had to hunch considerably to stand in the shower and had to fully squat to get my hair wet. If I were any taller or had a bad back I would have needed to switch rooms. Just when you start thinking that you're staying in a five star hotel for a three star price, the motel-style shrink wrapped complimentary bathroom toiletries and small tube TV remind you that you aren't (but those are, in my opinion, trades I'm happy to make for the reasonable room rate). AC was entirely non-functional, but we didn't complain or investigate further as our window kept the room temperature manageable; maybe it's only activated in warmer months. The hotel is very quiet, and our room was just off the common hall, so we could hear conversations outside (and vice versa). It would have been nice to have had the option for audio privacy with some AC or fan created white noise. On balance, given the excellent location, enthusiastic management, room condition, decor & ambiance, and fair room rate, I would absolutely return and will recommend the Ponte Antico to friends and family without hesitation.

We have stayed at hotels that offer superior service (such as the Four Seasons), but nothing has ever come close to the level of service that we received here. We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico for 3 nights at the beginning of our Italy trip in February 2008. The hotel itself is beautiful.

The ceiling was very high, with a beautiful chandelier. The room was large. The bathroom had a heated towel rack and a jet tub, perfect for relaxing. The location was perfect. There is a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. In the summer you can have your breakfast outside on the terrace, but in the winter it was just a little too cold to eat outside. As you walk out the front door of the hotel, you are on a very quaint Venetian street, just steps away from some of the main shopping areas of Venice. Breakfast was superb. Matteo personally cooked us eggs from his Grandmother's farm every morning, and the cappuccinos from his brand- new hand made espresso machine were outstanding. Matteo and his staff constantly gave us great suggestions: where to eat, what attractions to see, how much to pay for a Gondola ride, and so much more. My wife and I have stayed at many hotels. But we both agree that without a doubt, the Al Ponte Antico Hotel is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. As we left the hotel and said our good-byes, we both had a sudden sadness come over us.

The personal service provided by Matteo (the Owner) and his team was second to none. They made dinner reservations for us and ensured we were able to obtain tickets to the Ennio Morricone concert in St Marks Square. The hotel itself is small and exquisite we stayed in Room number 8 which had the most fantastic view over the Grand Canal, the furnishings and decor totally fitting for the room, the bathroom was compact however the hydro massage shower was great. Matteo the owner personally cooks breakfast to order each morning and the eggs are from his grandmother's farm, his pancakes were incredible. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and we will certainly return and occupy the same room if possible", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "leicester", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful welcome awaits you at this marvellous hotel\u201d", "Author": "LeicesterDaisy", "ReviewID": "UR8501541", "Content": "You can be assured of a very warm welcome at this lovely hotel and the best service from Matteo and his staff. The hotel is very centrally located and only a stones throw from the Rialto bridge. You can watch the world go by on the Grand Canal from the hotel terrace. From the hotel you can easily walk around the city and enjoy the sights of Venice. The service is fantastic and Matteo is on hand with lots of local knowledge if you need any advice. He will tell you about the best place to pick up a gondolas or recommend or book a restaurant for you if you wish. The hotel is exceptionally clean and smart and the home cooked breakfasts are very special. You can arrive at this hotel in style as the water taxi lands at the hotels own landing station. It is a great experience to pick up a water taxi at the airport and travel up the grand canal to the hotel.

Will it be as good as the photos indicate, will the location be convenient to restaurants and sites of interest and shopping etc etc etc ??? My wife and I have traveled a fair bit and I guess you would call us fussy We had concerns about Venice hotels in so far as noise whilst we slept, breakfast, the room, the view and so it goes on. .... We arrived at the Hotel by water taxi to be greeted by the owner, Mateo, A greeting so warm as to immediately put aside any trepidation. Mateo showed us to our room which loverlooked the Rialto bridge off a balcony and when I say overlooked \"I mean in your face\" - it was just stunning. Looking down on to the main riverway and all its water traffic there couldn't be a better outlook in the whole of Venice. The room was 5 star, spacious and I am talking normal spacious not Italian spacious; chandeliers and antique furniture and a great bed with 15 foot ceilings The breakfast was typical European, simple by many standards, fresh eggs cooked to your choice (Mateo makes great omelettes!) , fresh bread and meats and cheeses and lovely lovely coffee - expresso not jug boiled To wrap it up - our friends stayed at a 'very expensive' Venice Hotel and were very unhappy. We were absolutely delighted with The Ponte Antico, the surroundings, ambience and of course with Mateo who made us feel so welcome and very very special - we definitely got the better deal! We would always stay at Ponte Antico when in Venice - it is fantastic. Book here and you won't be dissapointed!!!

We arrived by Water Taxi and no sooner had we pulled up to the Hotel when we were greeted by Matteo. He knew who we were and was expecting us. Things just got better from there. We were introduced to the staff and then went out to look out on the Grand Canal. The Rialto Bridge is right there. We had the opportunity to stay in 2 rooms. Each room has a theme. The first room was large; it has 18 foot ceilings, a large bathroom. It was clean; the decor was meticulous in its planning. On the second night we moved to one of the rooms overlooking the Canal. Again another large room that had windows that went almost from the floor to the ceiling (again 18 foot ceilings.) The staff is very attentive, very friendly and helpful. Over all the Hotel is very clean, beautiful, romantic and quintessentially Venetian. The breakfast was a lot more that the usual continental breakfasts that you typically get. In fact Matteo will prepare your eggs the way you want them (with eggs from his grandmothers). He will also cook you, the Italian version of a Crepe. Fantastic. I have to say that this is not just a Hotel it is the person and that person is Matteo. His is the Hotel and the Hotel is him. He lives it and pays attention to every little detail; it's all about professional service and a warm feeling. All his recommendations for around town were great, his knowledge of history and genuine love of the city is embodied in this place. Book it now, because in a year you probably won't be able to get into this place due to the long wait list. Thank you Matteo and we will see you soon.", "Date": "August 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt doesn't get better than this wonderful hotel!\u201d", "Author": "MVPinBoynton", "ReviewID": "UR8255141", "Content": "We spent two nights at this very special hotel. The location could not be better with the hotel sitting on the bend in the Grand Canal. When standing on the balcony you can look to the left and see the Rialto Bridge and look to the right and look down a full view of the Grand Canal. Being by the Rialto Bridge also makes it very easy to find your way back to the hotel, since there are signs everywhere directing you back to the Rialto. It is only a 5-10 minute walk to San Marco. Although the location is great, the service is even better. The owner, Matteo, takes care of you like you are one of his best friends. The rest of the staff are always smiling and trying to find ways to assist you, if needed. The included breakfast is not to be missed. Matteo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specialty is chocolate crepes. Just unbelievably good! He also serves eggs made any way you want. The eggs are the best I have ever had. I believe the secret is that he gets them from his grandmother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm a couple times a week. The room was very comfortable and beautifully appointed in with Venetian style furniture and fixtures. It was also quite a large room with a dressing area. We had been upgraded to a canal view room right behind the balcony. The hotel has a one person elevator for people that need some assistance getting up the stairs. The air conditioning worked wonderfully. We have pictures of the hotel in our trip review at [--] if you want to see more of the hotel and read about our experiences while staying there. If you are lucky enough to be able to book a room at this very special hotel, consider yourself most fortunate.
