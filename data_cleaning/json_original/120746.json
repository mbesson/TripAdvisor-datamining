Our family was really looking forward to our 1 night stay in Hana. We wanted to take our time to explore Hana and the drive to Hana. Well, on March 8th, late in the evening, much to our dismay, they closed the road to Hana due to all the rain; there was flash flooding and rock slides. We we unable to go. We called Hana Kai in the morning and they knew that the roads were closed so they gave us a full refund on our condo. I wasn't sure if we would get a full refund or any refund at all, just because some (most) hotels have the policy of once they get your money they've got it. It really helped with our trip to not have to put out extra cash for a night in Lahaina. Even though, we didn't get to stay here, I highly recommend it. Great service! Thank you so much. On our next trip, we will be staying here! We did make a day trip out to Hana a few days later and the grounds of the hotel looked very nice.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo, California", "Title": "\u201cThin floors and walls!\u201d", "Author": "chicagogirl80", "ReviewID": "UR126282302", "Content": "Beautiful on Hana bay! It's a decent option if you don't want to pay the ridiculous prices of Travaasa Hana. Although the prices here are also ridiculous for the quality of the building(s)... but it seems your options are limited in Hana. We stayed in room 205, in the mauka building, for one night. The room itself was actually clean, nicely outfitted, and comfortable. There's a nice high ceiling with two fans to keep the air circulating. We had a good view of the waves crashing onto the black gravel beach portion of Hana Bay... it's not a nice swimming beach, but it is nice to see/hear the waves crashing from your room. My complaint and the reason for 2 stars is that the floors creak and the walls are super thin. You can literally hear everything that's going on in the other rooms, in the building and outside. You can hear your neighbors conversations and you can hear them coming and going. Also, the free wifi doesn't really work.. and you're not going to get reception. So expect to be off the grid while you're here, ie. no Yelping! to find local eats =) For $250/night, I'd unfortunately expect a little better.

The girl who checked us in was informative i.e. had a wealth of knowledge about local food etc and was friendly enough. The room is huge, kitchen well equipped, bed comfy and everything is really great...with one caveat; if you have noisy upstairs neighbors....you WILL know about it. Quite a bit of salt spray crusted on the windows but I guess it's the price you pay for the location. There are fantastic beaches nearby and the town itself is very \"local\", in a good way. Stores have limited stock so if cooking is your plan come prepared i.e. pick up stuff on the way from the airport. However, there are many roadside \"setups\" with traditional plate lunches (love the Teriyaki) and some good restaurants too.

We left notes for our housekeepers each day, and they wrote back :) We were happy to get to know them through our daily writings. The local people are very friendly and one day we saw a handwritten sign that simply said,\"MALASADAS\". We found the house and a local woman was using a propane deep fryer to make this sweet donut type confection. 1 dozen in a paper bag shaken with sugar. We bought 2 dozen and left 1 bag at the desk for the staff. They were delicious!

It was perfect for two people, with a nicely equipped kitchen and comfortable bed. The rooms on this level boast immediate proximity to the beach - just yards above a gorgeous black sand beach with crashing waves and wonderful sunrises and sunsets, and a beautiful wide lanai from which to enjoy it. But my favorite thing was that the sliding doors opened apart to create a double-wide opening, and the louvered windows in front the front of the unit allowed the gorgeous ocean breeze to flow right through the studio. As you drifted off to sleep, you could easily imagine your bed being directly on the beach. Good lighting and a warm color palette tied the overall ambiance together. Three nights was a really good number to stay on the Hana side - it allowed us time to explore Waianapanapa State park and Haleakala National Park with plenty of time to lollygag. For us, another night or two in Hana would have been great, but less than three would have left us feeling we didn't really see this side of the island. Perhaps most importantly, this side of the island really felt like you might imagine Hawaii. And Hana Kai Maui allowed you to feel close to the earth. During our multi-week stay on the island, we also stayed at three of the top four resorts on southern and western Maui, but truthfully, the days I look back on with the greatest affection were our days at the Hana Kai Maui. I look forward to returning some time in the future.

Hawaii, Maui, Hana we found expensive in general but I believe that the Hana Kai gives good value for money in Hana. It gives you the solid foundation of being more of a hotel as opposed to a guest house - which I'm sure are all lovely in Hana - but with the Hana Kai at least if you have a bad room you have a possibility to change it (assuming its not fully booked). Hotel staff were freindly and helpful, the black sand beach is great, so are the fish ponds in the little garden. The shops are close by too which is handy. The rooms were lovely, I would echo other peoples reviews about noise travelling through - but to be fair to the Hana Kai, they do ask guests to respect quiet time and really, if you've made the long trip on the road to Hana, you pretty much want to sleep once you get there! The crashing waves at night are a great soundtrack. Kicthen was well fitted and they had baking soda in the fridge, which was needed after all the mosquito bits from the waterfalls (baking soda is a recommended remedy)! Also in the room were useful books, maps and board games for fun. The room was spacious and the bedroom very nicely decorated. Place was all clean and tidy and well presented. I can't really fault the place and I am glad I chose the Kai over the other hotel in Hana. I guess it really deserves a 4.5 out of 5.

We had the unit 104 located on the upper building. The unit itself is spotless. Probably recently renovated - with great care and taste -. There is one master bedroom including a balcony facing the street. One kitchen (very well equipped), one living room (with pull out sofa bed) and bathroom including a nice storage-like room to put the luggage & clothes. But the \"treat\" is the main large balcony with direct ocean view. Really impressive and incredible for breakfast and dinner with it's large table and comfortable chairs. There is no A/C in the room, but trust me it's not needed at all, you have the cool ocean breeze during the night and the sound of the waves to put you asleep - much better than A/C - . The propery is directly on a beach (but this is not a beach for swimming) used by some surfers with a nice garden next to the beach. If you want to swim, go to Hana Beach Park or Red Sand Beach. The sunrise views are absolutely delightful (equally nice to the sunsets on the west coast of Maui). This place is so different from anything else you can experiment on Maui island. Remote, secluded, quiet, peaceful, nature, etc... Hana is really living it's own parallel reality to the rest of Maui and i hope it stays like this for many years to come. The Ohe'O gulch and the pools are 45 minutes drive from the property (very slow drive....the road to get there is quite an experience i have to say) and i really recommend to spend the day there including a hike thru the bamboo forest (Pipiwai trail) all the way to the majestic fall (400 feet fall). Another must is the red sand beach which is a 15 minutes walk from the property (not so easy to reach though ... ask for directions and be very careful with the trail as it's very slippery) but spectacular location and this is one beach you can swim since it's protected by a \"dragon teeth-like\" reef. Of course you have to go as well to the local general store (an attraction in itself) and walk to the fagan memorial - great views from up there -. Hana is a unique & gifted place on earth and Hana Kai Maui a great place to be and enjoy the best of Hana and the surrounding areas.

Pros- the view- we stayed in room #4 which was an oceanfront condo and we were literally right on the beach front. All night we left the windows open (which you have to because THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING!) and listened to the ocean waves crash onto the black rock. Also staff was friendly and the room had a fully stocked kitchen- even utencils which we utilized for breakfast the next morning- and the utencils and dishes were nice- not crappy old stuff. Also the room was nice and big- full living room, and free WIFI! Cons- majorly (and I mean majorly) outdated. The tub had corrosion around some of the facuets, and the whole place is in dire need of an update. The bed was also very small- almost thought it was a full size instead of a queen.

It was the cutest little gecko and he wouldn't bother anyone, he just came in, saw if there was anything for him (insects) and left. No big deal and the kids were ok with him, they thought he was cute. The sofa bed was very comfortable.

Pros: The room was very clean and was ready when we checked in. The woman at the front desk was efficient and made sure we knew were the local restaurants were located.The bathroom had a very unique tile feature, the bed was comfortable, and even though this was an older building, the room had been upgraded so you don't feel like you are in a 1970's apartment. Also, there was free Wifi. Cons: The building we were in (there are two) had very thin walls and ceilings. The refrigerator was noisy at times and the stove, while very clean inside, was showing signs of rust. Also, the front door and the doors to the lanai are louvered. This can be nice because it lets in the fresh air and you can hear the sound of the ocean and the birds in the morning. As we were on the first floor, we could also hear the cars in the parking lot, suitcases bumping up and down every step as they're dragged up and down the staircase, people talking on their cell phones to their friends and relatives back on the mainland telling them what a wonderful time they were having, chairs and tables being shoved across the floor and as one reviewer said \"elephant feet.\" It's amazing how much noise some people can make just walking across the room. I wouldn't mind this so much during the day, but at 6:30 in the morning all of this was a bit annoying. Ah, well, these people were here on vacation and spending their money so what the heck! Was all this worth $200 per night? Probably not, but this is Hana and there is not a lot of competition so you are going to have to pay a little more. My suggestion - just pay it, accept it, and enjoy yourself. Relax, you're in Hawaii! Also, If you come to the Hana Kai Maui, try to get an upper floor room.

The road itself is an incredible experience with poster-perfect views. The town of Hana was a great escape from the resort filled areas on other parts of the Island. In order to avoid feeling rushed on the road to Hana we decided to stay a night in town, and I now wish we had done at least one more night. There is a tremendous difference between the sun-drenched heat and sandy beaches near Kaanapali and the rain-cooled forests of Hana that it is easy to forget that the two exist on the same Island. The Hana Kai is a perfect place to make you forget. While we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly everywhere we went in Maui, I don't think our experience would have been complete without the night we spent at the Hana Kai. The room itself (#102) was just what we expected from the pictures, but the pictures couldn't do justice to the atmosphere you can experience from the balcony. Whether it was the relaxing sounds of the water washing up on the black sand beach***, or the unforgettable sunrise the next morning the views and sounds from that balcony will last with me forever. I had some trouble booking the room online (my banks fault...not the resort), and the staff was very accommodating in helping me sort out the problem. My GPS also struggled to find the resort, but the town is small enough that it didn't delay our arrival very long. The kitchen had everything we needed to eat our only \"home cooked\" meal of the entire trip, but if you do plan on using the kitchen for an extended stay I would have to recommend that you pick up some groceries before you arrive in Hana. The stores in town have a few items, but if you're even a little bit picky you might have trouble finding what you're looking for. I didn't personally take any exception to this, but for those who might, our room did not have a television. The room also didn't have AC, but the breeze off of the ocean was plenty to make the room very comfortable (also the temperature on this side of the island is totally different). It does rain consistently here, so in case you are driving a convertible (or a jeep with the top down), you may want to remember to put the top back up before you call it a night. There is a nice little grill area both on the upper level, and on the lower level. Again, we had a great time everywhere we went on Maui, but in hindsight I would have loved to have spent at least one more night at the Hana Kai! ***My wife made me promise that if I write a review on the Hana Kai, that I must mention (warn others) about the black sand beach. Outside of the ocean being present, there is very little similarity to a sugar sand beach. The sand (rocks) have a little bite to them when you're walking and the rocks in the water can be very slippery (and painful depending on your level of clumsiness). I did actually lose my wedding band trying to help my wife maintain her balance (also a note to newly married men, apparently you are not supposed to wear your wedding band in the ocean), and for all of these reasons combined I am writing these words of warning regarding the black sand beach outside of the resort.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middletown, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201ctimeless paradise on Hana Bay\u201d", "Author": "metalmaiden", "ReviewID": "UR80957729", "Content": "Old Hawaii; simple, timeless, breath taking.

Hana Kai has 2 buildings - the larger one in the back and the oceanfront one by the beach. (The larger one in the back also has perfect ocean views, but in the smaller one you seen nothing but beach ocean from your balcony.) The actual condo is very comfortable though not luxurious - envision your uncle's really nice 1-bedroom summer cottage. The condo has a full kitchen (except dishwasher) and really nice bed, a deck that overlooks the beach. The sound of the surf pounds on the rocks outside 24 hours a day, and I say that in a good way. The scenery is spectacular. There is no better place to unwind. One other reviewer mentioned that it is on a black sand beach. This is NOT accurate. It's on a black ROCK beach, not suitable for swimming. However there are swimmable beaches (including black sand) a few minutes away. This is the only thing I'll fault them for - not the rock beach but the fact that they use the word oceanfront without disclosing that the beach is actually rocks. The photo on their site is take from a black sand beach about 10 minutes walk away. (The hotel is the green-roofed buildings in the background) Service was very friendly and personal. Sitting on our deck eating dinner overlooking the ocean 100 feet away was the perfect start to our married life. We had a great time, and highly recommend this hotel. Is this hotel perfect? It depends, you have to like Hana. We spent 3 nights here and then 5 nights in a club-level suite at the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua. (Not trying to brag - we splurged for our honeymoon!). The point is that both hotels were OUTSTANDING but COMPLETELY DIFFERENT in every imaginable way. If you've been to Hana, you can skip the rest of this review. Hana is all about doing very little in stunningly beautiful surroundings. There are about 2 restaurants and 2 small stores. Like many visitors, we bought what we needed near the airport and cooked all our own meals. What little you can buy in Hana is generally very expensive, even compared to the main part of Maui. There are one or two activity providers, like a horseback riding company. If you're looking for snorkeling, parasailing, helicopter tours, luaus, souvenir shopping, gallery hopping, bar hopping, etc. those are easily available on West Maui, but not in Hana. Don't forget that the road to Hana takes about 2 hours each way and is a spectacular but tiring drive. By all means drive it during the day.

Our favourite part was how well we all slept here, the waves, the coy fish pond, and the breeze were like a symphony conducted by nature, it relaxed us and lulled us to sleep. I have to stress that it is an extremely relaxing location and we thouroughly enjoyed our stay here. My husband swam in the surf with the turtles as I beach combed with the baby and my coffee. We enjoyed exploring the town and its beaches, after just spending one day touring around the town we felt like locals. On the way out of Hana, we took our time and travelled along the southern side instead of the Hana highway, it was worth it as it was extremely scenic. All in all it was very relaxing especially after drinving the Hana highway which frankly made me a little ill. Our room was tastefully decorated with a traditional yet modern Hawaiin theme the colours were very soothing and the natural shampoo and soap were a very nice touch. The kitchen was well stocked and organized no need to bring extras as they had everything that you needed and more. There was also a herb garden available to use, so if you are cooking then you don't need to purchase and stock up on the pricey extras which I thought was also a nice touch. We assigned a score of 3 out of 5 in value because it was a little bit on the pricey side not to mention the town was expensive in both of the grocery stores and the restaurants. As a tourist you feel a little gouged so if you are planning a trip to Hana plan to spend a little extra, you will also want to buy banana bread and maybe some local art. I recommend to bring along a little cash on your way up so that you can stop at the fruit stands and sample some of the local fare. Just a little side note and not a big deal but we did have two cock roaches in our room, we informed the staff and they explained that they had just fumigated so they were bound to come out for a visit with the guests.

Housekeeping comes in to tidy up every morning and they even put away dishes that I had left in the drying rack. The grounds are well-maintained with flowers and ponds filled with koi. The only possible downside is that because all windows and doors are open and people sit on their balconies, you can hear your neighbours. You can hear sounds between both buildings, but being in the lower building closer to the water really helps to block out the sound. (I liked the lower building better as well because the balconies are more spread out while the upper building has balconies side by side).

This matters purely because they charge an extra $20 \"resort fee\" (not advertised when you initially book the room, but added at the time of final bill) and you may well wonder what it is you are getting for that fee. I tend to think that if hotels need extra money that badly, they should just increase the cost of the room accordingly. 2) Next, check out time is 10:00 a.m., earlier than I have ever seen, anywhere.

But to be able to open the sliding door and hear the ocean in your room at night -- that was one of the most unforgettable experiences we've ever had. The place has a full kitchen too, which comes in handy because the food in this area is really expensive and there aren't a lot of restaurants around. Some people complained that there wasn't much to do in Hana, but that's not the point in coming to a place like this! If you're looking for a laid back, relaxing time with incredible scenic views and sounds, and don't want to spend a ton of money at a place like the Hana Maui, then this is the place for you. We've been to this place twice so far, allowing us to relax after making the drive on the \"Road to Hana\" so we didn't have to drive up and back the same day, and wouldn't hesitiate to stay here on our next trip to Maui. We found that if we can get a flight that gets in early enough in the afternoon, we can take the drive to Hana that first day, spend a night or two in Hana, then head back to Kaanapali/Lahaina and stay the rest of the time there.

This was the part of our week long trip to Maui that I had been looking forward to. I couldn't wait to get away from it all and enjoy laying out on the beach in front of the resort. The Hana highway was quite an experience to drive, but we had done worse on the other side of the island. When we arrived at the Hana Kai, I couldn't wait to check in. We parked, and I immediately noticed the beach and that there wasn't one. From the company's website, the \"beach\" in front of these accommodations looked to be black sand. I was very surprised when we arrived to find that what appeared to be a black sand beach was nothing but black stones all over the place. This was not what I had in mind when I pictured myself laying out and watching the waves. In any case, we proceeded to the check-in office. We had originally booked unit #204 which was decorated and had a view that I particularly liked. When we checked in, we were not able to get unit #204 because the stove was broken. We were immediately \"upgraded\" to unit #201. We paid and went to our room. The first thing I noticed was the age of the accommodations and the stuffiness of the room. I knew there was no air conditioning, but no window or door had been opened in preparation for our arrival. The unit was extremely small, but did have a large lanai. It was clean, but it clearly showed its age. The units do not have tv and are only equipped with one ceiling fan. This \"upgrade\" we had received did not seem like one at all. Immediately we did not get a relaxing vibe from this place. We didn't feel comfortable and really could not put our finger on why. As such, I decided to approach the management desk where we had checked in. I explained to the ladies that the \"resort\" was just not what we had anticipated. The ladies were extremely nice and understanding. They explained that if we would decide before closing time if we wanted to leave, they would refund our money (minus the deposit). I was very surprised by this as I knew that they would be losing a lot of money on a confirmed reservation that was backing out at the last minute. Again, they were so generous and understanding to the fact that this place just wasn't what we had thought it was. To be honest, there was no decision to make. Once they said we would get the remainder of our money back, we checked out. We hadn't even unloaded our rental car yet. They did keep our deposit which we thought was completely fair, but these ladies were truly nice about the whole situation. Many people/companies wouldn't be that understanding. In any case, I would recommend this hotel to other people. It just simply wasn't what we were looking for. We finally figured out that not only was the \"resort\" not what we were expecting, but it was the fact that this place just didn't even begin to compare to the amazing accommodations we received in Kihei (at the Aikane). If you are thinking of staying in Hana, make sure it is for you. There are limited places to eat, only one grocery store with an unfriendly clerk (unless you are Hawaiian), and really nothing to do. The ladies at the management of this resort said, \"Hana is the vacation away from the vacation.\" If you find that laying on a rock beach, hiking, staring out in the dark at night, and cooking your own meals relaxing, then I would advise you stay in Hana and that you stay at the Hana Kai. However, we do not enjoy having nothing to do in the evening, and I do not find cooking and cleaning on my vacation relaxing.

Quiet hours are from 8 am until 10 pm (I think), but again, our neighbors did not think this applied to them. We had no choice but to wake up at 6:30 am when the other folks did. Boisterous children made sure of that. The place has a nice view and BBQ area. It's an easy walk to the Hana Hotel which has good entertainment. The Thai roadside stand near the Hana Hotel has fabulous food. You can't go wrong. The roadside stand, owned by the local world class chef was a real disappointment. The food was not edible and we ended up tossing it out. It's on the south end of Hana. The pool was under construction, so there was quite a bit of noise from that in addition to all the other renos.

I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need a place to rest when I got to the Hana end. But a wise friend of mine did, and she contacted Shayla Middleton, the private owner of the separately rentable Room 206 at the Hana Kai Resort, and made the arrangements for me. Now that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed there, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready to make that drive again! Forget the Seven Pools, simply luxuriating in this condo is worth the repeat trip. The delights are in the details, and Room 206 is rich with attention to design and detail. This isn't a cookie cutter condo... this place is tastefully hand done with a distinct styling that exudes class and is marvelous to look at and touch. Like the carved natural stone sink in the bathroom... you just want to hug it, as if it was an artifact unearthed from ancient Polynesia. To the left of this sink is a small pile of stones interleaved with face towels. So natural. Huge textured travertine tiles coat the bathroom floor and walls, trimmed with a band of random natural rocks that wraps around the shower, all lit by amazing looking light fixtures. The river of travertine tiles also flows from the entry into the well-appointed kitchen, that sports every appliance convenience you can think of... from built in automatic dishwasher (in the binder of instructions the owner states that Room 206 is the only condo at the Hana Kai that even has a dishwasher) to espresso maker to toaster oven (mounted on a stone/bamboo countertop extension) to smoothie blender to oven/range/microwave to cooking gadgets only seen on late night TV. If it is made for a kitchen, you will likely find it in one of the cabinets... where every shelf and drawer is fully labeled as to what goes where. On the subject of gadgets and conveniences, I noticed that there was high speed internet access, cat 5 cabling, cordless telephone, digital answering machine, digital music system, DVD player, along with a library of recent DVD movies. I didn't use any of that stuff... as I was escaping electronic social tethers, but for those that need a fix, this place has got the hook up. The high tech gee-wizardry continues up the rope-tied, bamboo railed and treaded stairway.. into the bamboo floored and wainscoted bedroom loft... hidden beneath the soft fluffy linens that are tucked between big tubes of bamboo headboard... in the form of a Select Comfort Sleep Number electronically adjustable bed. This bed has two remote controls that finely adjust the firmness/softness of each side of the bed... independently. Instead of hard metal coils for mattress springs, this bed uses individually segregated air chambers designed to relieve back pain while sleeping. Oh, and did I mention bamboo? The outdoor natural environs of a tropical Hawaiian paradise permeates seamlessly inside of this condo. Real bamboo is everywhere... on the door and window trim, across the vaulted cathedral high ceiling, and even in the artistic and unique furniture pieces that conceal other recurring condo themes of Hawaiian nature as well, like turtles. There is a natural essence to this place\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a feeling harkening back to a Polynesian thatched hut\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only spotless clean, with all the modern conveniences. The tropical outdoors is also brought indoors magnificently in the original artwork hanging on the walls. Throughout the condo there are beautiful canvases of Maui waterfalls, geckos, flora, beaches\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the piece d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122resistance has to be the humongous (who knows how many feet wide?) canvas of a Hawaiian beach scene that spans the entire living room lengthwise. Find your way out of this huge canvas, and the eye is greeted to the real thing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the sound of waves and the sights of the black sand beach being lasciviously licked by the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 all seen from the comfort of big basket chairs perched on the lanai (the outdoor balcony porch). The lanai of Room 206 is situated on the second floor of the Hana Kai complex. Being on the second floor not only affords the advantage of higher, airy ceilings inside the condo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it offers much better views outside. I can only assume that the folks who get stuck in first floor condos might try to escape from their lower indoor ceilings by taking refuge out on their lanais, only to be stuck again staring at the wall of the building in front of them. Room 206 can see over the top of that other building, and thus one can directly see the sunrise kiss the sky from behind the horizon without ever leaving the room. Since Room 206 at the Hana Kai is rented privately, separate from the front desk program, there is an additional layer of personal protection and privacy that I like. You can come and go like you owned the place, and no one there is the wiser. No 9 AM harassment from housekeeping. No itinerant front desk staff perusing the personal information in your check-in records. No guest services calls bugging you to see if \"everything is ok.\" Of course everything is OK. Being ensconced in a beautiful bamboo basket of a condo overlooking the black sand beach of Hana Maui... how could it NOT be OK? With no such threat of visitors, Room 206 is the perfectly private place to enjoy a prolonged, intimate, and varietal course of honeymooner's salad... lettuce alone, without the dressing!

The views and experience of staying at the Hana Kai outweighed the negatives , although, would be remiss if did not mention that there certainly are some negatives for Hana Kai. For starters, be prepared for a very rustic feel. Although it does have a full kitchen/bath , no appliances are high end. The microwave did'nt work, the shower hardly worked, no a/c, no tv,no radio. Highly recommend stopping at the general store and buying or bringing your own playing cards/board games. Maybe bring your own ipod/radio too cuz there is no music/tv to play at all. No iron / ironing board, room service,fresh towels. Seems like a lot of negatives but this stay was pretty fun. Hana is a great place - but you can't expect much from the local lodgings.

This is a beautiful location and a different view than you would get elsewhere in Hana (better view than the fancier resort in town). Feels like looking out on a South Pacific island beach. The beach is rocks and great for strolling (when it is not raining). Continue along the beach around toward the point to really explore and eventually meet up with the old kings highway trail (a little hard to find). Swimming is 2 minute drive down the road at the main Hana beach. I wouldn't call it reasonable given that it is >$200 per night after taxes for the 1BRs. But the studios are just as nice (and perhaps better for two people since you wil have a view from your bed while the 1BRs has the bed in a back room with a patio looking o the street). But if no studios are available, this is still worth it. Our only complaint is that although the kitchen is well stocked with cooking appliances, utensils, etc. it does not have any of the main things one needs as a traveler who is cooking -- namely olive oil and salt and pepper. Those would have been nice since the key to this place is cooking in and eating on the deck or using their BBQs down on the beach.

By far, the Hana Kai Maui was the highlight of the trip. We spent our last two days on the island driving the road to Hana, used the travel book Maui Revealed, and stopped at a few of the great hiking spots - that guide book is a must for Hana. Prior to heading up to Hana we spent a couple of days at a good B&B in Lahaina (Penny's Place - good) and a couple days in Kihei (I will never return to Kihei it is one big stucco strip mall with no appeal other than its proximity to Waillea.) Also, got a massage at the Grand Waillea, I will remember their spa for the rest of my life -- spectacular. Check out the Web site. But, back to the hotel -- we arrived at the hotel late in the day after stopping for a smoked pork sandwich at the little collection of shops just before the Wanannappa State Park, delicious, I can't stop thinking about them. The hotel isn't beautiful, or even 3 star, but the location can not be beat, even at the Hotel Hana. We spent hours sitting watching the sky grow dark and listening to the rocks roll as the waves came in and out. One thing I will say about Hana Bay is that it is not swimmable in the area near the hotel. Unlike at the state park about twenty minutes before you arrive in Hana, Hana Bay has a beach made of small black rocks, not sand. You really can't even walk on it without shoes on. That said, listening to the rocks on the beach as the water comes in and out is a unique and lovely experience and the beaches you can swim in are close enough. The room we had was in the building closest to the water and we were in the corner room on the bottom floor, by far the best view in the hotel with an enormous lanai. The room was very big, the kitchen really was fully stocked, and the bed was soft enough. The shower is a bit odd as it has a window that faces the outdoor hallway and someone could look in on you while you shower if you forget to close the slats, a little disconcerting. We had dinner at the Hotel Hana and it was the best meal of the whole trip. I've also eaten at Roy's, Ruth's Chirs, Kobe, and Vino as all the travel guides suggested. The are good, but the Hotel Hana was outstanding. The next morning we drove the opposite way to leave, stopped at the Seven Sacred Pools then over and around to the Tedeshi Winery. This often skipped side of the island is sooooo cool! It looks like you have landed on Mars, or the desserts of Southern Utah. The guide books make it sound as if this road is really rugged but our Chrysler did just fine. The Winery is charming and the wine is good for the price point. I would recommend taking this drive if you have the time to spend on your way back from Hana it is a whole different side to Maui and you could have the road all to yourself for miles at a time. Also, we stopped on the way to O'heo Gulch and ate lunch in the front yard of the guy with the sign that says \"Best Plate Lunch on Hana.\" It seems a bit strange eating in the guys front yard, but he doesn't lie, his chicken was out of this world, and the macaroni salad was the perfect consistency. Give him a try if he is there when you are. Also, make sure you take all the side trips through the small towns on the ride up to Hana. The first time I made the trip to Hana I didn't and missed out on some of the best parts of the journey.

Most people drive the road to Hana and back in one day. My new wife and I (we are in our eary 30s)decided to find a place in Hana, and our 2 nights there were the best part of our 8 day honeymoon. It's nice being pampered at the 4 and 5 star resorts in Kaanapali or Wailea, but Hana was the first place we felt like we were seeing the \"real\" Hawaii. In the morning we could hear roosters and peacocks on one side of the road and the crashing waves from the beach on the other. The beach at sunrise is stunning. There are two small general stores that are a 5 minute drive from the condo. There is also affordable horseback riding through the Hotel Hana - also a 3-5 minute drive from Hana Kai Resort. Hamoa Beach (Bay?) is 5-10 minutes from here - a gorgeous stretch of beach. Yes, it's a good idea to keep all of your food wrapped up in the fridge (we cleaned up every crumb meticulously), because there are obviously critters roaming around - but we never saw a single insect in our room for 2 days. The place is very clean and relaxing. Sitting on our big Lanai (we were in room 203), we felt like we were in a Corona commercial.

The decorative pool is green with algae and the building looks really plain from the outside. But everything else was great. PRICE. The price was pretty reasonable. After paying $300/night for a room at a hotel in Kaanapali, I didn't mind paying half of that for a one bedroom unit with it's own lanai and a newly renovated kitchen. Our unit was on the second floor (in the building closer to the road than the beach). It was nicely furnished (and I'm picky about decor). The kitchen was clean, modern, and well-equipped. Based on the previous reviews, it looks like some units may not be as well-furnished as the one we got. VIEW. Fantastic. The ocean is visible from the lanai and the living room and the kitchen. I didn't mind doing the dishes. LOCATION. It's right on a pebble beach. You may not want to swim, but it's nice for walking or for sitting and contemplating about a move to Hana. There's a great beach nearby called Hamoa beach. It's a great place to swim and relax. (The guests from the Hana Maui use this beach). HANA ITSELF. It was the best part of our 9 day visit to Maui. It truly is special and a world away. A FEW TIPS: Eat dinner at the Hana Maui hotel and go to the Paniolo bar to listen to the band. Buy some food supplies and eat dinner on your own lanai. It's very romantic and easy on the wallet. BUT, make sure to use bug spray specially at night (there were mosquitoes). There are no TVs, no phones (inside the hotel), no internet.

After reading the reviews and various travel guides we decided to stay at the Hana Kai Maui resort. It is a good deal for the area but not that great of a place. We could hear all of our neighbors (including bathrooms) and every conversation in the parking lot. Now, what to expect: no AC , noisy rickety fan (It never cooled our room), old kitchen, a few dishes, and a ton of bugs outside so no open windows. Overall the furnishings were old and in need of replacement. The major items were clean like the toilet and towels but the sheets and pillows were questionable. The premises and patio/lanai are nice. The best part of the Han Kai is that each room has its own guest book and includes great stories from previous patrons, I ony wish they had gone onto trip advisor to share thier wisdom (it was too late for us so read on). People talk about how wonderful Hana is, but my wife and I do not agree. It is pretty but the locals treat you not as a guest but as a nuisance (excluding Hotel Hana Staff which are being paid handsomely to treat you nice). I was really shocked how far it could go as one set of Hotel guests had their car pelted with cans and cursed at when they tried to park next to the softball field. Apparently it was a locals only event(call the Hana Kai and ask). If you like to experience old small towns with small town attitudes set against a beautiful tropical backdrop then Hana and the Hana Kai Maui Resort is the place to stay. Otherwise, I would highly recommend driving in early (bring your own food) and hiking the major sites and driving back to stay somewhere comfortable, clean, and friendly that appreciates your business.", "Date": "November 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cNo Pretense - No Luxury, but perfect\u201d", "Author": "TVTravel", "ReviewID": "UR4053786", "Content": "If you want high-tech gadgets like televisions, telephones, air-conditioning, internet access, dishwashers, and garbage disposals DON'T stay at the Hana Kai. In fact, I had to climb the stairs to the 2nd floor just to get my celphone to work (Verizon, the only cellular service in Hana). If you like to be lulled to sleep by pounding surf and don't need room service and mints on your pillow, this IS the place! I've done the one day, drive-to-Hana,-look-around-and-leave trip many times. This trip, my wife and I decided to stay for a week. What a difference! All morning, the town and the cool things to do are almost lonely. Then, about 11am or noon - depending on where you are - a parade of rental cars invades. It's almost a comical sight. Staying in Hana gives a great head start for your daily activities. The Hana Kai offers a free night if you stay 5 off their already reasonable rates ($120/night for a studio with ocean view). You'll probably spend the saving dining at the ultra-expensive Hana Hotel, which is the only place in town that serves dinner. First night, my wife and I did their fixed price special which came to $200 for two (including wine). OUCH! The second night we did salads, appetizers, and wine: $100 for two. Then we discovered the bar menu, and ate the rest of the week without needing to take out a 2nd mortgage. \"Maui Revealed\" is a book so good many locals would like to lynch the author for tipping off the tourists to their favorite \"secret\" spots. We found it invaluable in planning each day's activity. The book's only serious error is their liking for Tutu's as a decent lunch spot. I had the worst plate lunch I've ever tried to eat there! Much better to patronize whatever guy has a BBQ set up on his front lawn that day (and it varies), or buy banana bread at one of the various stands. Be sure to buy groceries in Kahului before doing the Hana Highway drive. You can get the absolute basics like milk and POG from the 2 stores (Hasegawa's and the Hana Ranch), but the meat in both is extremely limited, expensive, and somewhat suspicious looking. Late in the day, local fishermen congregate at Koki Beach to drink beer and sell whatever they caught, so if you want to combine local color with a gamble that they had a good day, you can find your dinner there and take it back to the condo to cook. They'll even filet your selection if you ask. This is supposed to be a review of the Hana Kai, not the Hana region, so I'll finish by describing the place and its features. They have a website with 360 degree views of the units (which is how we found the Hana Kai) so you can get a good idea of it from there. Our studio unit had a queen size bed, ceiling fan which kept the unit a perfect temperature at night, a small round table, very small kitchen (no dishwasher or garbage disposer) with limited selection of cooking utensils, coffee maker (coffee supplied), and a nice lanai with big table, chairs, and a view of Hana Bay complete with daily sunrise. Daily maid service with fresh towels is included. They ask that you do your own dishes, but the maid will clean up whatever you didn't get to. The office is open from 8 to ?, but a resident takes over night manager duties to give out keys to late arrivals. They provide beach towels and mats upon request, have a couple of lounge chairs on their lawn and a community barbeque area. No swimming in the weird little pool. The beach that the condo fronts is a large rock one, with pounding surf. Enter the water there at your own risk! It's a 5 minute walk to Hana Bay Beach Park, where you'll swimmable water, and the notorious Tutu's snack bar. Hana Kai offers a no-pretense, no-luxury place to hang your hat while exploring Hana.
