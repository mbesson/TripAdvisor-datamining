The stay could not have been better or easier. Very friendly staff, the room was clean and comfortable (I ddint' take a picture but it was one of the pink ones with a large double bed and there are lots of other pics from other people). We had a babysitter who was able to sit in the conservatory area when we were out and our toddler was sleeping with a babyphone which worked perfectly. When I asked for a glass of milk every night for my son it was brought up and we werne't charged for this. Very well placed but not noisy (our window faced onto Ixworth Place on the 2nd floor) for walking to South Ken/Sloane Square. The MAIN BENEFIT for a parent though, bar the friendly, accomodating staff was that 3 minutes down the road is a brilliant playground!!!!!

Fortunately, we found myhotel Chelsea. I'm compelled to write this review--my first for trip advisor--because the hotel was absolutely terrific.I should tell you I am a very picky guest. I need a quiet room because I am a light sleeper. As I have a super-sensitive sniffer, I require a room without any musty or perfumy odors. Also, I can't tolerate stained carpeting, showers that don't regulate, and mattresses that have been around the block a few times too many, You get the picture? I'm very fussy. So here's why I liked this hotel so much: 1. Superb location near Sloane Square, Harrods, V & A Musuem, Brompton Road, Kings Road etc. but on a quiet street 2. Clean, modern f,f&e (furnishings etc) 3. Thick walls 4. Great bedding including suitably thick comforters and firm but not too firm mattresses 5. Ample water pressure and large enough shower head to provide nice flow; it was hand-held but with a mounting for hands-free use; shower curtains included so need to worry about flooding the floor; no wandering temperature syndrome 6. Ample lighting for reading and dimmable for other activities 7. Helpful staff 8. Safe easy to use with your own credit card; no pin to input or remember If there were any nits to pick they would be: 1. Bathroom doors had glass panels so light streams through; if there are insomniacs in your crew who repair to the john in the middle of the night for some reading time....not going to happen 2. Not intuitively obvious but turning on the TV requires pressing and holding down the power button for 5 seconds 3. We only got our Walker's shortbreads the first night....was this an oversight?

It was well furnished, if a little on the small side. Our lights stopped functioning in the bathroom so I complained. After failing to resolve the matter, we were given room 44 which we were told was the best room in the hotel (the website soon showed us that it wasn't - there were two better ones). Room 44 is a large suite at the top of the hotel with big room, seating area with second TV and a large bathroom with bay windows. It was very nice. However, the bathroom lights soon stopped functioning. Staff heroically managed to get them working again but they went off again soon afterwards. Imagine our embarrassment when we came in on Sunday to find a postcard on the floor behind our door. It turned out that the faulty lights that were following us around the hotel were caused by our faulty electric toothbrush. Having identified what the problem was, I was very impressed by the way that the staff went out of their way to, first of all, give us another and better room, and then to let us stay in the better room once the source of the problem had been identified. Not only that, but they also gave us vouchers for Champagne cocktails on the house for our trouble. That was first class service and I was most impressed! Continental breakfast is included in the price and was generally very good. On the last day I had an English breakfast which cost me \u00a34 extra. I thougt that was good value as the food was very well cooked by the kitchen staff. The only downside; on the last day, my partner had to leave for work before breakfast started. We asked the night before if there was any other option available for her. They said \"No!\" and \"Please do not set foot in the breakfast room before 7.00am as it will upset the girl who prepares breakfast\". So, spotting a porridge-type meal in the hotel room, she took this with her to eat on arrival at work. When I went to pay the bill I was aksed for \u00a32.50 for the porridge. I enquired whether this could be offset by the fact that my partner was unable to eat breakfast that day. I also pointed out that I, too, had been unable to eat breakfast on Saturday due to having to leave early in the morning. \"Absolutely not. Two different departments!\", I was told. So, I had to pay \u00a32.50 for the porridge despite saving the hotel two breakfasts.

En route to Ireland, I chose myhotel Chelsea because of its central location but in fact, it's really more of a boutique hotel on the 'edge of the action'. Everything I needed was -- pretty much -- within walking distance and I did feel I was in exactly the right place in London to achieve my ends. First off: I stayed in the Geisha studio which was charmingly decked with everything to supplement a mock-Japanese setting. DVDs of Japanese-themed films, music to set the mood, Saki cups and green tea pots ... this room really set the mood. But it wasn't just a 'room'; despite being described as a 'studio' room, the room was very large with a HUGE bed [choice of pillows supplied] and there was a good-sized bathroom PLUS a dressing room [complete with mirror/make-up lights]. I wasn't mad about the puce/magenta colour scheme but that was a personal thing, because the whole set-up was utterly 'geisha' and designed to relax and restore. I did really appreciate the the communication from the hotel marketing staff: check-in time was 2pm but I informed the hotel I would be early and would like to leave my bags at reception [no problem, they said!] and joy of joys, my room was ready at 11am at no extra charge. That's always something one remembers. The only 'extra' hotel service I enjoyed was the bar area. It DID look like a breakfast bar [despite the nice number of tables available] but I felt it was too 'light' in colour/lighting for a real bar, despite the great service and nice selection of drinks and bar snacks. Nice staff too; I even found a lovely server behind the bar who has spent time in 'my part of the world' -- UAE -- and she was very sweet and warm to talk to to. Check-out -- a breeze [as was check-in] and my sleep was fantastic [just what I needed before starting the next leg of my holiday]. Would not hesitate to recommend myhotel Chelsea for a fantastic central point upon which to base one's trip to London, and I will certainly be staying again on my next trip. Thanks again, everyone! :-) PS. Particularly LOVED the fact that there was a computer in my room AND free wifi access.

The \"King\" bed was wide enough for two people, but not much more. The room itself (room 1) was awful. The decor is a take on Chinese red and black lacquer, which was fine, but the bed was not more than a low-pallet with a thin, hard mattress. The end tables had decorative light boxes, so you couldn't read in bed without the overhead light on. As mentioned in other reviews, there are few TV channels and a majority are sports. The closet had 3 cubby-holes and a half-width rod for hanging things. We left the bulk of our items in suitcases for the week. The toilet took 3 or more flushes to actually work. The free internet was good, but you receive a password that is good for a single device. My partner used it for his iPhone, leaving me unable to connect my iPhone or laptop. When I contacted the front desk, the process for getting an additional password seemed to hassle them. In addition, the new password was only good for 24 hours, so every night, I would have to call again and go through the same routine to get it back. On the final afternoon, I asked for it to be reset then so it wouldn\u2019t go out that night. Also, I wanted 3 passwords, so we could get everything connected and up-to-date before leaving for the airport. The desk clerks response was \u201cThree? That\u2019s a lot.\u201d Then she asked if it had to be right then or if I could come back later. I said later was fine, and they were, in fact, available upon our return, also she did still seem really put out and somewhat confused as to why I needed that many connections. The shade in the bathroom was thin, and at night people on the street could you out in the shower. The shower was an odd affair, a tub that was tear-drop shaped with a glass shower door that only ran half the length of the tub. Even being careful and huddling underneath the sprayer, you still got water on the floor, wall, and the window shade. The staff in general seemed confused about everything. When I asked if there was a launderette in the neighborhood, they had to call me back. They called back to tell me that Google maps didn't show any. On my own investigation, I found one within a few minutes walk. Also mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel is located near little. The South Kensington tube station is a 1/2-mile walk. Taxis are easily caught at the hotel, however, which was good. Being an American, I asked for some ice for the room. The desk clerk led me into the closed-for-the-night bar and asked \"Do you want it in a glass?\" I had been thinking a small bucket, but just said \"yes, please\" to move things along. We went to the bar during the afternoon one day and I ordered a drink off what looked to be the \"smoothie\" portion of the drink menu, only to be told that they didn't have any of the ingredients for any of the fruit / berry drinks. I then ordered a Side Car of the cocktail portion of the menu. A while later, someone came to our table with a snifter of cognac. I said, no, I had ordered a Side Car. She was confused by this, so I pointed to the actual item on the menu. Eventually it arrived, and was tasty, but not worth the wait and effort. Our \"Superior\" room, backed on the kitchen, and was just outside the bin storage. So each morning we enjoyed the smells of breakfast being prepared, along with the associated banging and clanging of the preparation, and on one day we got to enjoy the early-morning trash collection noise. Overall, it was a miserable hotel, with a woefully under-skilled staff. At checkout, I was asked if I'd had anything from the mini-bar. I said, yes, I'd had a diet Coke. The woman told me that it showed that I'd had a bottle of water. I said it had been a diet Coke, but if she wanted to charge me the 1 pound less for the water, that was fine with me. The bill settled, she asked, \"When will you be coming back?\" To which I replied, \"It won't be for a long time.\" I thought it too rude to tell her \"never\" outright.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cA rare bird in London - a hotel that doesn't disappoint\u201d", "Author": "Cosmo_Felani", "ReviewID": "UR67330363", "Content": "Hotels are so expensive in London, and few deliver the quality that the same money would get in a different city or country.

The staff are very friendly and try to be as helpful as they can. If you want to stay in South Kensington ( a Posh area where there are good museums and shopping..) then its a good location and close by the South Kensington Tube station. The hotel has a common area where you can use the internet and make yourself tea and there is a very limited selection of DVD's you can rent during your stay. But overall this area is nice with comfortable couches and books and magazines to browse. And the small dining area is cute with a fireplace and nice size patio for when its warmer. The Classic Rooms are very small and only acceptable for 1 person comfortably but the Superior rooms are a good size with a decent size bathroom, closet and a desk area. I don't know if this is vital to my review, but the hotel smells very nice with candles burning and free cookies or mince pies available in the lobby, which is a nice touch. The negative- This is my third stay at MyHotel Chelsea and I used to stay here b/c it was close to where I used to live but on this last time I was very disappointed. First of all for the price per night (which can be $300 plus USD) it is not that nice. The rooms need to be renovated and the lobby is showing signs of wear (that red carpet on the floor is gross and needs to be replaced). The sheets on the bed were rough and not soft at all. The desperately need to upgrade to higher thread count sheets. Overall the bed was very uncomfortable. The t.v. is fine, size wise, but there is no cable, which I think is ridiculous. For what you pay the hotel should have cable. And most of our channels were unclear and we constantly had to fiddle with the cords or call for assistance. Since there are no movie channels or a channel to buy movies we were forced to use the hotels DVD collection (which has about 20 DVD's to choose from) including a Mary Kate and Ashley Olson movie, 'Glitter' with Mariah Carey (yes that movie) and other horribly bad movies. If you don't offer cable or a Movie Channel, the hotel should really improve their DVD collection. I had pretty bad jet lag so I couldn't sleep that well at night and after reading some it would have been nice to watch a good movie. I think I would prefer to stay in the East End next time b/c everything in the South Kensington area is so expensive and closes early. And although I appreciate the hotels attempts at a 'Green' environment, the shower gel/shampoo products were a mess. They are in these black paper-like packages and when you used them in the shower black wet paper got all over you. I am all about saving Bee's (that what their products 'cause' was) but I don't want wet black paper all over me when I shower. And the towels need to be replaced badly. They had ripped strings of cloth hanging from them and were not soft. Although the robe in the bathroom was nice and much appreciated. The common area was closed for two days during our stay (b/c of a conference, which I thought was strange b/c the hotel seems like the opposite of corporate) which was a bit annoying b/c we couldn't use the hotels computers or get in the common area during these times. Overall this hotel is in a good location (if you want to stay near the Chelsea area and be near to a Tube station) but the hotel needs an upgrade most notably in their linens, towels, and mattress. The hotel is overpriced, in my opinion, for what you get. If you do stay here ask for a higher level room away from the road, which can be quite noisy.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a quiet yet central area\u201d", "Author": "AntwerpTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR50268722", "Content": "At 199 including breakfast, a good rate for that area, for a large room.

However, they dealt with this really quickly when we pointed it out, and didn't charge us for our coffee and dessert as recompense. It was explained that the chef was 'confused'.

But a few things: 1 - the noise! as the room is so close to the street and back of the hotel. there was alot of noise in the morning with deliveries/people chatting etc. so couldnt lay in. 2 - the smell, after brekkie noticed a really bacony smell in the room.not nice 3 - too much light - the blinds/curtains worked well and blocked the light out. but light came streaming in under the main door and through the bathroom door (see below) 4 - bathroom privacy. Firsty the door between the bathroom and main room only has a flimsy net curtain on it. so its possible to see thru. Plus the blind to the outside wasnt too think either! not impressed So thats the room... Now the bar/restuarant! After getting back to the hotel around 1am, it was alot of hassle to get a drink. The night manager let us in and we was told we had to wait 10 mins to get a drink. After careful discussion the night manager did it himself (was a nice chap actually - so thanks), but seemed alot of hassle. The bar is also the main restuarant! so when going down for breakfast it was full up and we had to stand around for 15 mins to wait for a table. Dont expect this in such an expensive hotel. The breakfast was pretty average and alot of hassle getting served. The waitresses where lovely and very friendly, but there wasnt enough of them so the service was overally poor. 2-3 of them had to service breakfast inc making coffees etc and this wasnt enough. Felt sorry for them as they tried hard, but the management team need to address this. The breakfast wasnt anything special and they didnt give me the tommy sauce I asked for! So overall - the hotel was ok, we had an industry discount so only cost around 130 for the night, if I was paying fully I wouldnt have been very happy. It was too small and you wouldnt want to spend much time within the hotel (not outside area apart from a tiny balcony with 4 tables!).

The hotel is ideally situated in a quiet area off Sloane Ave, near to some of Londons best shops and restuarants in the more genteel borough of Chelsea. This is great if you dont want the bustle of the west end. However, the hotel lacks a great deal when it comes to service. Firstly, checking in was a process that involved a 20 minute wait in reception for no apparent reason being greeted by every member of staff which is of course nice but no one actually getting around to giving me the key to the room, not so nice. Secondly, I had been in touch with the 'concierge' via email to arrange a car and driver for the evening which I had been assured in writing was booked but suprise suprise the Hotel had no record of this. I ordered some food from room service also which by my standards (and I have stayed in lots of hotels) was well below average, I have had better tasting Pret a Manger sandwiches. I mistakenly asked the concierge to book me a table at Toms Kitchen for Lunch and when we arrived the they had no record of my booking. Thank god for the very accomadating Maitre d who took pity on us and found us a table in a fully booked restuarant. (Toms Kitchen btw is Marvelous, the food and the service are immaculate and resonable too!) On the morning of check out, well before the 12pm checkout time housekeeping knocked on the door a record 4 times and then an over enthusiastic member of staff wandered in, letting herself in and without knocking. Needless to say, I was NOT amused. The final indignation occured as my Boyfriend struggled with our very heavy bags down the front steps to a taxi without an offer of help from the assembled staff. In conclusion MyHotel Chelsea is OK, it has a great SW3 location, Aveda toiletries and Sky TV and as long you need treat it as you would a travel lodge and pretend the hotel offers nothing more than a bed and a few extra scatter cushions you'll enjoy it just fine, but as far as service is concerned, the Four Seasons it aint!!!", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cGood - could be better\u201d", "Author": "mooshai", "ReviewID": "UR10053634", "Content": "Stayed here the first week of October for 2 nights since I had meetings at an office only a few blocks away.

Generally, the staff seemed eager to impress. However, on arrival the reception desk was deserted, and I had to alert the staff to my presence by sticking my head around the back office door. Bad start. The gentleman who checked me in was helpful enough but seemed unable to smile and wasn't particularly friendly, nor did he apologise even once for his initial absence. The hotel itself is virtually perfect, in size (this is London), decor and facilities. It is just small enough to be boutique, yet not so small it is pokey- a happy medium. Location is brilliant- Chelsea is a lovely area, and the hotel is convenient for South Kensington tube; which is the main thing for both tourists and business travellers to London. The atmosphere in the hotel makes it a wonderful haven in busy London and a brilliant base for one\u2019s travels- perfectly relaxing. On arrival I found some complimentary fruit in my room, which was a nice touch. A disappointment came that evening when I requested an ironing board, and was told \"we have none left\", even after a debate about this, one took a while to come. When it did it was the traditional overused and flimsy rubbish- looked quite out of place in such a nice hotel. Using the (ancient) iron fused the electricity in the room. When I went out for dinner I left the ironing board in the room, with the empty and dirty fruit bowl atop it. When I returned the ironing board had been removed, yet the fruit bowl was carefully placed on the coffee table. It seems a small thing but returning to a dirty fruit bowl on the coffee table was a bit of a disappointment! The beautiful widescreen LCD television unfortunately didn't work throughout my stay, not that I missed it. The turndown service came around at 6pm while we were dressing for dinner, which seemed a bit wrong- we never did get this service in the end. On the whole however, the atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful and provided you don\u2019t expect too much from the staff they were generally polite and helpful enough.

In fact, I checked the bill thoroughly, handed over my card, signed the receipt and then the girl at reception took the customer copy (printed separately), stapled that second receipt to the bill and folded it up and put it in an envelope and sealed the envelope. So, it wasn't until I opened the envelope that I discovered the switch. I consider this a very distasteful end to an otherwise nice stay and will complain to my credit card company about it. One other warning, we tipped everyone as we were told service was not included in the food bills, but when the statement was printed out at the end of the stay, infact there were service charges added subsequently to all food charges.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "Sooky", "ReviewID": "UR4975671", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for two nights and it was fine for location, room size and decor but badly let down by indifferent service. For the rating of the hotel, the staff just weren't up to the job: they watched us struggle with bags into the hotel, appeared bored by the effort of explaining where to find our room and never seemed to care how things were. Details were neglected - there were no glasses, nor a corkscrew in the room and it took several calls to secure a ropey corkscrew and tumblers. We ordered a simple room service lunch that was slow and incorrect - over \u00a35 for a horrid, luke warm hunk of bread with fatty ham and semi-melted cheese. The minibar wasn't refurbished and the cleaning left a lot to be desired. As we checked out, the bill was inaccurate and the staff once again unhelpful. Not at all deserving of its rating and needs a lot of work to warrant a recommendation from us. What a shame when a fantastic location and building is ruined by careless staff.", "Date": "April 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough UK", "Title": "\u201cFeng Shui in Chelsea\u201d", "Author": "Slitsy", "ReviewID": "UR4896698", "Content": "Booked at last minute for myself and my adult daughter so opted for a twin room.

No twin rooms on arrival so we were upgraded to a double suite with a portable divan which was a but small but my daughter said she could sleep anywhere due to tiredness from work so we stuck with it (I wouldn't have been happy on it). Hotel was a delight with a Feng Shui theme - different scents e.g. new mown grass in reception. Decor modern and attractive. Suite had a smallish bedroom and a small lounge but combination was good. Bathroom was decent with robe and slippers available. We opted for continental breakfast with plentiful range of cereals, breads, fruit cold meat, smoked salmon etc. Cooked for those who requested it. The library, accessible with room key has free internet facilities and a small fitness centre attached. 5 minute walk to underground station(sorry those who say 10, you are plainly unfit!)and the same to restaurants. Kings Rd not far away with excellent shopping. Overall quite expensive, despite the deal but lovely for a treat.

I had visited Myhotel Chelsea for a Christmas drinks party, and was impressed with the decor and ambience of the hotel. It is really quite pricey, but I thought I'd give it a go! Our room was so small you could bearly swing a cat - the decoration was lovely - beds nice and comfy, but I would have preferred enough room to get into the room without having to move bags around each time - than the designer accessories! There seemed to be a problem with the heating - on our first night hot air was constantly being pumped into the room - we didn't sleep! The next morning we asked if they could look at the problem, and was told on our return that it had been fixed - it hadn't!! We went to see reception again, to be told there was nothing they could do, and the hotel was fully booked so they couldn't move us to another room. Another sleepless night in a sauna! (that is honestly no joke - that is how hot it was!) When we came to check out there was no apology - no offer of any kind of compensation. It is an extremely expensive hotel - and in my opionion far too over priced - if your looking for real luxury with a first rate service I would highly recommend the Parkes Hotel in Knightsbridge - they can not do enough to make sure that your stay is as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible", "Date": "March 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4328425", "Content": "My boyfriend and I spent a weekend at Myhotel Chelsea.
