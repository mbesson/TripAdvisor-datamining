The website describes it as like a private club and a home away from home. However, the rooms were basic and run-down in every possible way. The twin room I stayed in with my daughter had beds made up with sheets and duvets but no duvet covers. I queried this with the receptionist 1) on the grounds of hygiene 2) mis-representation of photographs on both the hotel and tripadvisor websites. She told me it was management policy not to use duvet covers on any beds in any rooms. The furniture and furnishings were low-quality eg unmatched beds, bedside cabinets, wardrobe and fridge cupboard. Everything was random, seedy and the thin carpet was sticky. This supposedly Superior room, as opposed to Standard, was described as looking into a courtyard, which was actually a dark space next to a store room. The room smelled of poor drainage and damp. I queried this with the receptionist who said it is a problem of this type of inner room which is difficult to ventilate and keep aired. She would ask the cleaners to attend to it the next day. Their solution was to leave on the bathroom wall heater ALL DAY so that the room was unbearably hot when we returned that summer's evening. The painted walls and doors were grubby and chipped. The shower room was very small and run-down eg old, cracked tiles, no drain cover in the basin and fixed wall soap dispensers which reminded me of a public toilet rather than a boutique hotel. I could go on to describe the cockroaches in the second floor seating guest area and my conversation with the receptionist, which was reminiscent of an episode of Fawlty Towers but I will stop there! Overall, nothing was 'boutique' or likely to satisfy a discerning traveller. I agree the room price I paid, AU$135 for Wednesday/Thursday and AU$145 for Friday/ Saturday, was less than many CDB hotels. Also, Double Bay is a delightful location with much to recommend it. However, neither of these excuse seedy, run-down, basic rooms mis-represented as 4**** standard.

So friendly and helpful, I couldn't speak highly enough of him. Secondly, the position was incredible. Right in the heart of gorgeous Double Bay, with cafes, shops, a walk to Edgecliff station and an even easier walk to the Ferry docks. Two options for getting into the city (downtown Sydney) in a matter of minutes. The ferry is by far the more beautiful travel choice! The figs and surrounding houses and building are gorgeous and show off some of the best that Sydney has to offer. The room was small-average sized hotel room, the bedding was clean. We had a child with us and used the fold out couch as abed as well as the queen bed. With the fold-out opened and made-up there was hardly any room to move about - beware! There was a small table and 2 chairs that were able to be used and a small bar fridge, which were nice convieniences. Another great feature was that the fold-out was made up and out when we arrived, which was a great touch. Too often they know you will be using the fold out couch, and when you arrive you have to open it up yourself and deal with all the cushions - or worse, open it up and make it up yourself! The savoy is clearly good at customer service as this was all done in anticipation of our arrival - thank you Savoy. The bathroom had some newer touches - the vanity and sink looked new, but the tile and shower did not. Some mould and mildew, throughout the shower and floors and a build up of dirt and dust in the corners of the bathroom, the bathroom door had cracks in it and was water-warped. One of the days we were there the floor drain had some kind of terrible smell coming from it. It dissipated by the next morning. The bathroom was VERY small and the letdown of the room. Though the room was definitely on the older side, it all seemed very clean and well-looked after. Sadly, the bathroom let the whole room down. If they could renovate this to a cleaner, newer look, I would rave about this hotel. All in all, the hotel provided for our needs, and at a reasonable price (about $130/night I think). We only used parking for one night ($15/night) as there was street parking that was able to be utilized as long as you were prepared to move your car around after your few hours were up. They did have an economical breakfast option also, that we didn't take advantage of. I would visit again if it were just for a night, but if staying a few nights like we did for 3 of us, it was a little small and the bathroom not clean enough.

On arrival late in the day, I was allocated a room which on entry smelled of paint. Despite opening the window, the strong smell persisted and was so overbearing that I was unable to have a decent night's sleep. I think the paint fumes were coming from newly painted tiles in the bathroom. The room was described as Superior which is a gross misrepresentation. The room was extremely small, the decor was dated, walls chipped, TV at least 20 years old and there was a large hole in the blanket on my bed. The next day I asked to be moved and without any apology at all, was given the key to another room. One of the staff members on reception was helpful, the other completely rude. The room I moved to was just as jaded as the previous room though fortunately there was no smell of paint fumes. Judging by the other reviews on this website, it appears that the hotel has gone downhill rapidly in the past couple of years.

The upside - the Savoy is small, cozy and in a great location. Breakfast was good - fresh fruit, cereal, toast, juice - how do they do it so cheaply - it's great. Downside - the hotel is in dire need of TLC and basic maintenance. The door to our room didn't lock (apparently there was a trick to it, we were told when we informed front desk. Suggestion - maybe tell the guests first? Or maybe fix it?) The a/c will freeze you and rattle scarily and when we reported that we were told it should stop after 5 or 10 mins. Again, how about fixing it? It wouldn't be possible to sleep with that noise. Broken window slats, rusty fridges and in one room the smell was so awful I felt sad for previous occupants who put up with it. The thing that got me moving to the checkout 7 days early was the lack of cleanliness and lack of care about it. At dinner in the atrium area, we'd dropped some food and didn't realise until we moved away from the table and saw 6 massive cockies having a feast. The little cockroach in the kitchen was having a good time too, same couldn't be said for the big squashed one right outside our door. After 2 trips to the front desk about it, no action, no care. Glasses unwashed in our room, never enough towels supplied, strangely changed stories about whether we could get a refund upon early checkout or not, just unprofessional and giving Sydney a bad name for service. It's a sad, dark little place which a good pest clean and fresh coat of paint could really fix. We moved across the road into the Sir Stamford for the remainder of our stay - Clean! Light! Friendly! Quiet! Not much to ask for but the Savoy needs to sharpen up.", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highbury S.A. 5089", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ojnab", "ReviewID": "UR5044217", "Content": "We spent three nights at the Savoy Hotel, although only 3.5 star rating it is a charming small hotel, the staff are so friendly and were always obliging to help with any queries we had.

We do feel however that it may be best to book a superior room with window, the normal rooms did not seem to have this luxury and they appeared to be rather dark.

The best thing about the hotel was the staff-- they were so incredibly helpful-- even gave us an unused bus pass that a former guest left behind and answered all our questions, kept our luggage (no charge) while we went to the Hunter Valley, and offered lots of advice about sightseeing and restaurants. Rooms are small but adequate, showers/bath rooms are all newly upgraded with nice fixtures, and you can get breakfast in the hotel. Price is quite reasonalbe, we booked the internet special for $110 for 2 people with twin beds which was a real bargain! Double Bay is just 4 stops on the train from downtown, and the train station is a ten minute walk from the hotel (uphill mind you, dont plan on lugging your luggage up the hill) The buses stop just a block from the hotel and best of all its a short walk to the ferry terminal where you can catch a ferry to Circular Quay.

Located on Double Bay, a suburb of Sydney. It's a 10 minute walk to the train station (up a pretty good hill) and a 5 minute walk to the ferry. We had a deluxe room, which was spotlessly clean, with a high ceiling, although not huge. Our third night there (unplanned) we had a standard room. These face an interior courtyard so have no windows, and are quite small, but again, spotlessly clean and with all the amenities. We found both room sizes perfectly adequate, as all we needed it for was to sleep. Double Bay is a very upscale section of Sydney, and has some beautiful architecture to look at, as well as boutique shopping and some great restaurants. It's about a 15 min train ride from the Circular Quay train station, which we found perfectly convenient. Located in the downstairs of this hotel is a small restaurant. It serves asian food for lunch and dinner, but is the location where the hotel offers their breakfast offerings in the mornings. Our room rate included a continental breakfast, and it was the best we had our entire visit. It was all you could eat cereals, breads, fresh fruits, juices, coffee and tea. For a small price ($5.50 AU) you could have a hot cooked breakfast. What really made this hotel special was the staff. They were wonderful. Very knowledgeable about Sydney and many other areas, even as far away as Cairns and Townsville. They were happy to let you check your e-mail in the evenings no charge (no web surfing though, and we didn't see an internet cafe anywhere nearby). We got advice on car rentals, traveling to the Blue Moutains - everything. I highly recommend this small hotel. It made a wonderful first impression of Sydney.", "Date": "August 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cCosy hotel close to the city\u201d", "Author": "nwhow", "ReviewID": "UR3603928", "Content": "It has been some time since I stayed there and as a fairly frequent traveller not many hotels stick in my mind but this one did.
