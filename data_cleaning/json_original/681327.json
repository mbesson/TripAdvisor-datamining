Stayed this time in a two bed apartment which is very spacious and has four bathroom areas. Same size balcony as one bed apartment. Unfortunately all the two bed units are on the side rather than the front of the hotel and therefore do not really get much sun on the balcony. Ideal if you do not want the facilities of an actual hotel. Breakfast is average but sufficient. The front desk staff are very helpful and the young manager quickly sorted out minor difficulties with the lack of hot water. It is a short walk to the Dubai City Centre metro station and a couple of minutes more to the City Centre Mall. Small supermarket close by for water and snacks.

The rooms are really nicely decorated, clean and come with a well equipped kitchen complete with full-size fridge (great for keeping your beers chilled - NB you will need to buy alcohol in bulk at the airport when you arrive in Dubai as the shops don't sell it).The bathroom is immense - huge by hotel standards, tastefully decorated and with nice quality complimentary toiletries! From the window of the apartment we had a pleasant view of the city. The hotel is very close to the Deira shopping centre, though there is not much else in the area to do, and we found ourselves regularly using taxis to get to places we wanted to see. That said the taxis were very cheap, the slightly poor location of the hotel was not a major issue to us. The front of house staff were friendly and helpful, providing us with tourism advice and arranging taxis for us, as well as printing a few documents we needed due to a change to our return flight. We used the swimming pool most days and there were rarely ever more than a few guests there, which meant it was always easy to get a sunbed. The swimming pool itself is not huge, but more than adequate for relaxing and cooling off in.

I really can't fault it with the price I paid; it has far exceeded my expectation. Spacious living room, quality bed (though a bit small), fully equipped kitchen - freezer, microwave, toaster, dish washer, washing machine & other quality kitchenware...everything is in good condition and well organized in cabinet. The toilet is big & clean with two toilet bowls....this is something unusual to me. They also provide a weighing machine in the toilet! We booked the apartment thru booking.com at AED350, after reading good review from travelers and for its price. Due to tight schedule, we only managed to check in to the hotel at mid night 2am. I was so tired and could hardly open my eyes, until I entered into the apartment. It is really surprised to see the beautiful setting in the apartment! I double checked with my husband if he got us in to the right room as it seems too good for the price we paid! ( & both of us regret for checking in to the apartment too late.) Although there is a construction side right next to us, we didn't hear anything noise (maybe due to the construction was stop for UAE National day). We wake up late the next day and were so excited to see the wonderful scenery - the Burj Dubai & Dubai Creek was in front of us! Never expected it (and didn't notice it at night)! We were not aware of the time till we miss the breakfast (it is only available till 10.30am). It was around 12pm by the time we went down to lobby and were understood by the reception staff that we supposed to check out in 10mins.

The hotel opened in May 2007. The room was very modern and tastefully done. It was a fully equipped studio with very high ceilings and probably the best bathroom I've had in a hotel ever. The kitchenette looked to be superbly equipped, although I didn't stay long enough to use the facilities. Toiletries in the bathroom were again excellent and more wide-ranging (disposable toothbrush etc) than any other hotel I've stayed in - and as we usually stay 4 or 5 star that's saying something.

All hotels will require a taxi to other malls or sites so it\u2019s best to be by a beach or mall. 5 minute walk to Deira city center mall that has all the comforts of home (food, clothing, upscale restaurants, food court, etc.). Definitely feels like you are staying in a commercial park with tall buildings all around, but I think that is the way most of Dubai feels. BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Extremely comfortable bed with high quality linens. Pillows were way too thick, but thinner, down pillows are available on request. LIGHTING: Just a tad too dark in the bedrooms and the hallways are way too dark. Bathroom lighting was excellent. BATHROOM/SHOWER: Absolutely stunning. This will impress even the most seasoned and discriminating traveler. It will be one of the nicest bathroom you\u2019ve ever seen. Very masculine d\u00e9cor and color. Great water pressure and consistent water temperature (be sure to flip the switch on the wall for the water heater). Only complaint is they use a shower curtain. TOILETRIES: Great. Probably the kind you want to take home. CLEANLINESS: The entire room, hotel, and bathroom was spotless. A/C: Just a tad louder than we would have preferred, but very effective in cooling the room quickly. CLOSET SPACE: Tons of space for 2 to unpack everything. STYLE OF ROOM: Stunning. The room is absolutely gorgeous. We were blown away, especially with the one bedroom vs. studio. Both rooms have washer/dryer, burners, microwave, toaster, and larger than normal refrigerator for a hotel room. QUIET/LIGHT: The room was very quiet even though construction is right outside the hotel, like nearly all hotels in Dubai. Lighting in the bedroom and bathroom was great. FOOD: Only had cereal. They have a breakfast buffet with some meats and cereals, but you can pay a la carte. There is also an ice cream cart in the lobby that also has muffins and croissants. A one minute walk away is a convenience store to load up on food to cook in your room or put in the refrigerator. TV/INTERNET: Flat screen TV was of good size but just a little too far from the bed (in the studio, and from the couch in the 1 bedroom). Wired and wireless internet is available in the rooms for US$5 for one hour of continuous use of US$27 for 24 hours of continuous use. You can not log out and save minutes for later consumption. The internet here is way too expensive. We were told they were going to allow guests to log out and save their minutes for later. There is also a computer for guest use in the lobby with the same charges. SERVICE: This is the area that makes this hotel terrible. Some requests would only be made after several calls. Sometimes when calling reception, the phone would ring 10 times before an answer. We were charged for 2 days of breakfast when we only ate their one day. They had a signed bill from someone else, clearly different from mine and it was a very long process to get it removed, as if they didn\u2019t believe me. The staff is very nice but very incompetent and powerless. Even the managers have absolutely no power. Our washing machine broke the morning we left and we left the hotel carrying wet clothes, had an extra charge on our bill on our breakfast, and all the management said is they will take care of us next time. I asked how, and he said he will make us happy. I cancelled our already booked room for 3 days later right in front of the manager and he did nothing. Too much detail here but this is a major issue with this hotel. The concierge here was a former tour guide and is excellent and helping plan your trip, I strongly encourage meeting with him when you arrive. COMMON AREA: The lobby is nice but does not reflect the incredible rooms above. The pool is very clean and is surprising staffed to provide towels and drinks. Hallways to the rooms were way too dark. Hotel has a hip \u201cW\u201d-ish style to it. TIPS: It was great buying popcorn at the convenience store and being able to make it in the room with the microwave and watch movies. If you can live with the incompetent staff, you will be very impressed by the rooms. The one bedroom option here could be in the fanciest hotel in the US and you will still be impressed. If you can afford the upgrade, definitely book it. Please check my other hotels listed in case you are nervous about there only being one review on tripadvisor. If the service was better this would be a 5* review.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Star Boutique Hotel Apartment", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d681327-Reviews-Star_Boutique_Hotel_Apartment-Dubai.html", "Price": "$95 - $261*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">PO BOX 181689</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">15308</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "681327", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/b5/ccb54a525594e4e12c9770b9434975503large.jpg"}}
