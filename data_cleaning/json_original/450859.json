{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent place to stay in SANUR We stayed in this hotel for five nights over New Year\u9225\u6a9a. It was highly recommended to us by friends who stayed there during their visit to Bali. There was no in room safe but reception provided safety deposit boxes. We were just off the pool area, so that we could walk from our patio to the pool for a swim and back. The bathroom was large with a huge tub. Lots of hot water in the sink and shower. Breakfast was held in the outdoor restaurant near the pool area, a couple of seconds from our room. Make sure you try their banana pancakes, they were excellent. We unhesitatingly recommend this hotel. However there was one petty incident during our stay. I had been going to the restaurant before breakfast to get coffee to drink on the patio while my wife was getting ready. For three mornings this was not a problem. On the fourth morning, the head waiter refused to allow this saying that taking any food from the restaurant area is forbidden. When told that we had been allowed previously he said that the staff was wrong in allowing it. Maybe he was having a bad day or he wanted to impress the staff with his power. We were not impressed. We did not allow this incident to colour our appreciation of the rest of the staff and their flexibility.", "Date": "Jan 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR696157894", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Canadian079"}, {"Content": "Small and very nice hotel       Check in at the Sativa Hotel", "Date": "Aug 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR357278908", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Mats_Stockholm"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d450859-r12926391-Sativa_Sanur_Cottages-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "450859", "Price": "$71"}}
