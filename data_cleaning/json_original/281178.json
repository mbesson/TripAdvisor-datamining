Every time the heater turned on, a terrible WHEEEEEE whining sound would screech out and wake the dead. The bed felt like a hard plank, totally uncomfortable and my back/hip hurt the next day. The exterior of the front entrance was a messy soggy carpet because there is a low spot there with a drain and all the snow melt drains into that area (poor design).

Ttipadvisor had informed of the ongoing renovations at that location. Therefore, I did not make an online reservation. The receptionist (telephone) was most amicable and assured us that a newly renovated room would be available. Our trip to Montreal was quicker than anticipated. Upon our early arrival at the hotel, the receptionist was very understanding. She explained that we could immediately occupy a room that was ready on the South side if we wished. She pointed out that the room that had already selected on the North side would give us a better view of Mont-Royal if we could delay our registration till 3pm. She gave us a temporary key so that we could park in the garage. We then enjoyed a stroll along Sainte-Catherine Avenue until the normal registration time. Upon our return, the new receptionist was equally agreeable. Everything in the room was immaculate. The view (17th floor) was outstanding! It was a delightful start to our day and a half escapade in Montreal. The following day started with a superb buffet breakfast (complimentary). The employees in the restaurant were also very attentive. There are many sightseeing opportunities in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. The 20-minute walk the Old Montreal is a pleasant outing by itself. There are countless interesting stops to be made along the way.

Overall they're clean and functional for being retrofits. I like the balcony off of the sitting area. Some of the common areas, doors, and halls appear to require some TLC. That said, they're doing reno's and updates as of my stay dated Dec 18, 2011. The pool was a bit cool, and there's no Hot tub. The change room had a dry sauna which was nice. There are balcony's surrounding the pool area, but it was well below freezing and we didn't venture out. The breakfast buffet (\"continental-plus\" so to speak) was one of the best and most efficiently run I've visited. Great selection of food, fresh and very clean. The staff was excellent and their was ample seating. Parking underground is nerve racking if you have a minivan as the ceilings are very low. Keep that in mind.

The first thing you notice is the property is located on a one-way street. So unloading must be done from the passenger side of vehicle. Signs are prominently posted stated 15 minute maximum to unload. We were driving our SUV (Mercury Mountaineer) and had sufficient luggage for the two week road trip we were on. Also, we had our pet Chihuahua with us and needed a \"pet friendly\" hotel which this hotel is. The check in experience was pleasant and acceptable. We were told that their on site parking would not accommodate our SUV due to the height of the vehicle, but they had a deal with some school worked up. We were told it was very safe and secure and just around the corner. It turns out it was 3 blocks away and was simply a public parking lot which requires exact payment in advance, no change made and no credit cards. The bellman cart for the luggage was typical of the carts you find at many hotels. What wasn't typical was the fact that with the cart in the elevator, there was no room for anyone else to enter the elevator. I proceeded to our sixth floor room (#610), a corner \"suite\" and my wife came up on the next cycle of elevators. I had wanted a king room but only double beds were available. At least it was non-smoking. While the linens on the bed appeared to be clean, the rest of \"suite\" was far from clean. The carpet was extremely worn, with traffic trails, what appeared to be cigarette burns and did not look the least bit clean. The lamp shade was badly stained, which to me indicated that the room was not always, \"non-smoking\". The shower had what appeared to be mold in the corners of the walls where they met at the tub. The A/C unit leaked badly onto the carpeting under the unit. The couch in the studio was tattered and torn and appeared as if it was just picked up at Goodwill. It took pictures of all these shortcomings but don't believe it would be appropriate for me to post them now as this is still an ongoing situation with the hotel. About 10:30pm a terrible noise that sounded like a jack hammer was off and on for about 20 minutes. I have no earthly idea what it was. Earlier at one point, the smell of garlic cooking was so strong in our room it also brought tears to your eyes. Upon checking out the next morning, my wife and I mentioned all the above to the front desk clerk. She was obviously not empowered to do anything. We had made the statement that the $75.00 fee they collect for each pet, should maybe be spend on cleaning the rooms. I don't think she understood the implication of the remark. I wasn't expecting so sort of concession, but nothing other than to comment she would mention it to her manager. Two days later I received a call from a woman who apparently was the manager. She also completely missed the mark and whole conversation but offered to refund 1/2 of the pet fee. I later noticed in checking my on line card account that in fact a refund had posted. At same time I also noticed that another $60+ dollars was added to the bill. There is no reason for that charge as we did not charge anything to the room, etc. I still have that battle to fight. Bottom line is customer satisfaction is all about expectations. If they are met, you are satisfied, if not then, you are dissatisfied.

I decided to change my hotel plans for my Montreal Stopover by canceling my overnight stay at the Best Western Europa and booking at night at the Montreal Marriott Residence Inn (Westmount) Location. I decided to book an overnight there on my way home because I enjoyed my stay at the Residence Inn in Halifax. Check Inn was easy and quick but during the check inn process, I was informed that it costs $1.00 every time a call is made even if its a local or 1-800 number call. I found this very disturbing because im already paying money to occupy the room and if I had to make several local calls, it would of been very costly. This is the first time I have encountered this at a longer stay hotel. My train from Halifax arrived into Montreal at 9:00am and I checked in at 9:30. After and overnight train journey I was very happy to be able to access my room right away. Breakfast was still available and was able to have somthing to eat after I had checked in. After Breakfast I went to my room only to find that the room was very small compared to the room I stayed in at the Halifax location. The room had a small kitchenette which included a fridge, microwave, dishwasher, a stove and cutlery however with the size of the room there was only a desk with only one chair. How could a couple take advantage of the kitchenette if there isn't anywhere to eat????? I was also not impressed with the furniture as it looked like it was from the 80's and the room looked dated and worn. To make things wrose, dirty dishes were left in the hallway. I also found the air conditioner to be very noisey which made it hard to sleep at night. The rooms in this hotel need to be upgraded. Very disapointing for a Marriott!!! On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and I was able to enjoy a nice breakfast upon my arrival and the next morning. The breakfast was plentifull and offered a good variety including, juice, fresh self prepared waffles, scrambled eggs, bacon, cerial, bagles, fruit and toast. I was happy with the breakfast but I was very disapointed with the eggs as they tasted very stale. Coffee and Newspapers were available through out the day. This hotel is located in a quiet residential neibgrourhood close to the Atwater Metro Station. Noise and Street People begging for money were not a problem and I felt very safe at this location. However to get to the Shopping District or Downtwon expect a long walk or a $10 dollar cab ride. For me, it was a 30 minute walk to the Central Train Station. If your comming to Montreal to enjoy the night life or to do some shopping, I would stay at a more central location. Really this hotel is just a place to sleep if you had to spend the night in Montreal if you were on business or traveling through. No frills and nothing special.

With a government rate of $129 per night, we definitely got our money's worth. First of all, the staff is top notch. True professionals. Edison, Brenda, Richard and Kathryn were always ready and willing to provide their expertise for restaurants, attractions, etc. I mean we would literally ask a question and they would pull up the information on the web instantly. In fact, one night I asked for some additional salt and pepper packets at the front desk and Richard took the time and effort to find some in the kitchen and provided me with a cup of salt and pepper. Totally above and beyond what I expected. I don't know where the manager of this hotel found their staff but I hope he/she is doing everything to keep these great staff members. These individuals are part of the reason our stay in Montreal was so wonderful and why we will be back. Now, the hotel is definitely not 5 star (we visit Chicago frequently and stay at the Hilton always); however, the rate was great considering most hotels cost almost $200 per night in Montreal and the neighborhood was ideal...not too far from the action of St. Catherine but quiet enough to enjoy hanging out on your balcony. This area is also very safe. Anytime my husband and I see single females walking their puppies at 2am we pretty much know that we picked a safe spot to reside temporarily. You also have to use your card to get into the hotel after midnight which is another level of security that we liked. The metro is less than 5 minutes away which was perfect for our 10 day stay considering we did not rent a car (which I suggest since the Metro is simple to manuveur just make sure you buy an unlimited pass). Also, the hotel is conveniently located to restaurants (Angelina Guidos is yummy), a shopping center with a pharmacy and grocery store inside (and all within walking distance). However, there was one problem when we first arrived. After pulling back the sheets, I noticed a yellow marker stain on the sheets but when I reported it to the front desk, Edison offered me to upgrade or change sheets. Being that we'd been up for 13 hrs. I chose the upgrade. My husband and I were so glad that we did considering the suite was much roomier and the 17th floor provided an awesome view. Oh yeah, and there was no change in the room rate. The kitchenettes in the suite are ideal. My husband and I being picky breakfast eaters were not feeling the breakfast options offered by the hotel (with the exception of the potatoes and eggs which were tasty) and chose instead to buy our own meats to cook and just brought the fixings up to our room to eat when we were ready. This worked out well for us a few nights when we wanted to eat in as well. Go to Atwater Market and pick up some fresh fixings and enjoy a romantic night in like we did! Ultimately, this is the best hotel that I have stayed in in terms of the level of service, way better than any service I've expererienced in some pretty nice hotels in CA, Hawaii, or even Puerto Rico. My husband, having travelled across the world while in the Navy for 21 years agreed with me...he's never had service like he did at Residence Inn Westmount. Look past the older furnishings but rest assure that the room is going to be clean (thanks Maurene) and choose Residence Inn Westmount as the place to stay when visiting the fabulous city of Montreal.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westfield, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGood night sleep, parking and wireless are a challenge\u201d", "Author": "ggtirevite", "ReviewID": "UR69666738", "Content": "The hotel is in a good (not best) location, about 10 streets from Crescent street and the rest of the action. The room was not bad. We had a two double beds in one room and a pullout in the other, two TVs. The bathroom was just ok, some paint peeled. It was obvious that it had not been updated in a quite a few years. It was difficult to get a good night sleep, caused by two issues: First was the mattresses on the double beds creaked loudly when anyone moves on the beds. They should be replaced. Second, (and somewhat out of the control of the hotel), we had a family with small children across the hall, and the parents left them get in in and out of their hotel room and play in the hall from 6h30 AM on. Second issue is that the wireless access only worked about 30% of the time. When I called the front desk (did it three times over the course of the stay), it waited a minimum of 5 minutes and the record was 17, after being told to hold for 'a moment' . With teenagers, that was a big issue. Third, forget the underground garage if you have a minivan (not bog enough to accommodate larger cars), their option is an outside garage two+ blocks away, which was much less convenient than anticipated. At least, it was cheap ($9 a day). I am a regular in the Marriott chain and usually stay at the residence inn downtown (on Peel street) where I have never had a bad stay. I have also stayed at other residence inns elsewhere, and was always satisfied. My recommendation would be to stay downtown if it is available.

This fitted the bill well. It was actually very convenient for downtown as well as the University, as Atwater station is just around the corner. The Metro is very easy to use, and that line also takes you out to the Olympic park and its sites easily. A short trip also to Old Montreal. The studio suite I had was spacious with a very well equipped kitchen. I am not sure where the moans on this site about the rooms come from. Yes it is an older hotel, but although the corridors are well used, it is clean and the foyer is very modern. The room had a good desk corner with internet and a good sized bathroom and there was also a balcony. I realised afterwards that if you want a view ask for a Mount Royal view room. I had a downtown view. From the Penthouse where the pool is you can see both ways very well. The pool is lovely- small but well looked after. Refreshing after a hot walk! Overall, I think this would be a really good hotel if you had a family as the rooms are spacious and well kept. The desk staff are very helpful and welcoming and can give advice on places to go. They were a bit funny about my credit card booking via Co op travel in England as they said the card didnt work- I explained how big a company the Co op were and that there must be a mistake, but it took almost my whole stay to sort which was not good. It turned out to be a mistyping I think! They were very friendly about it, but the continued saga was wearing. Breakfast is good and there is lots of choice. If I had to moan it would be that there is often a variation in whether the cutlery is plastic or metal. So one morning we had lots of metal knives but only plastic forks! The coffee was great. The service varied from good to less cheerful! The gym is small but enough and well kept. I would recommend this as somewhere to stay in Montreal.

So, keep that in mind. First, the hotel is very clean; rooms, foyer, etc. I never saw any problems whatsoever, and I like rooms clean! My friend stayed there 3 years ago, and I stayed there (with same friend) in July 2006. I'm not too sure about the $175 cdn per night, think it could be more like $120? The lobby is just like in the pictures. As mentioned by others, there are only 2 elevators, so you may have to wait a little bit, but not terrible. The free breakfast wasn't bad. My friend mentioned that is was a continental breakfast, but there was cereal, yogurt, small pancakes, sausage patties, scrambled eggs, bread, bagels, juice, tea and coffee. You could eat here no problem, but the pancakes were a little dry and flat :( They also have free hors-d'oeuvres about 4 nights during the week. One night they had chicken nuggets, salad, mini quiche, bread rolls, juice, and coffee/tea. So, having said that, I will say that if you are used to big name hotels that have the nice buffet set out, looking all pretty, you will not find it at the Residence. It is much more casual fare, something you may throw together for yourself and your kids if your were at home, but still laid out okay. The room in which they serve the food is small, and can be a bit noisy. There are a number of tables out in the lobby area, which are more quiet, and cooler. We had a room on the 14th floor, which was clean and bright. The furniture was clean, did not appear well used at all, and was comfortable. I slept in the king size bed in the bedroom, and my friend slept on the pull out couch. You have to make up the bed in the pull out, so be prepared for that--bed stuff is in the hall closet. I read stuff about the A/C being loud, but you know, that is with a lot of hotels, but not the big name ones. It wasn't extremely loud, but it reminded me of when my family and friends have stayed in motels with window A/C, so it is about that noise level, but it didn't bother us. There was plenty of space to put away clothing, etc. There is large closet in bedroom, along with drawers in chest. Also chest of drawers in living room in front of pull out couch. The kitchen is great, having all utensils, plates, pots, etc for you. Great size fridge, but microwave probably should be replaced. Stove was older, but very clean. There is a balcony for each hotel room, but, it is a standard apartment balcony, with no chairs or anything, and there is some water which is just from the air conditioner unit. Also, people may go out there to smoke, and our balcony had not been cleaned of cigarette butts. I didn't really care, because I would never use the balcony anway, but the \"dirtiness\" of it could turn people off. Now to the comments about the general area. Yes, this area of Montreal is not like being directly downtown. You walk down the end of the street, and you see graffiti, and some people don't take care of their gardens. It almost seems dirty looking sometimes. There are a lot of panhandlers/beggars, whatever you want to call them. I think Montreal needs to do a clean sweep of these people. That was one thing that turned me off, and may turn off a lot of tourists that are not used to that. You will have to walk by them (most of them are sitting) but be prepared for some of them to come right up to you. Again, just make a point of walking away. Most of these people were on the main streets, and also in downtown Montreal. This is a Montreal problem, cause they are everywhere. I will say that I never felt unsafe. I think the area might make you feel that way, just because it doesn't look great, etc, but my friend and I walked at night a few times, but there were also other people out, and we were okay. If you are someone who really likes the large name hotel experience (room service, large foyers, restaurant, lots of elevators, immaculate rooms, etc, etc), then do NOT go to this hotel. Go to one of the hotels in direct downtown Montreal. If you can handle the idea that for your stay, it would be like living in an apartment building, but with free food, and front desk help, then you could probably handle staying here. You have to remember, this is a RESIDENTIAL area, not the pristine streets of a metropolitan city. If you want shops, be really close to old Montreal, etc, then go to the downtown hotels. Have I made you understand what type of hotel this is? Like I said, it would be like living in an apartment in a residential area of Montreal. No fancy shwancy stuff. It is quiet, there are no problems there. Again, I want to prepare you that Montreal is not always clean looking, the graffiti, etc may turn you off as you start walking down to the main street, and which you may see at their Metro (train station), but other than that, Montreal is a busy, interesting place, with MANY places to eat. If you want some interesting nightlife, go to Crescent street. Montrealers love their patios, and this street is full of them, and is THE partying place at night, mostly Friday and Saturday. For a great breakfast, go to Burgers&Benedicts (at the Pepsi Forum, just a couple blocks down). I had the 2 eggs with meat plate for $6.00, and it came on a big plate. Lots of bacon and grilled potatoes, etc. Very good food.

In the suite, our kitchen was fully equipped to make and serve dinner for four - something we have rarely found in places claiming to be 'suites' with kitchens - and the housekeeping services include washing the dishes! There is also a free grocery shopping service. We didn't use it, since we wanted to see what was available in the local grocery for ourselves, but on a long-term stay it would have been nice. We were in Canada during a heat wave - 90 degrees and humid - and our a/c kept up just fine. We thought the place was very clean, our housekeeping staff was great, and we had plenty of room when the sofabed was folded. The rooms and lobby really look just like the photos on the website, so there were no 'surprises.' For families like us, who do loads of laundry even on vacation, the laundry room was sparkling clean and pleasantly decorated, and the clothes were actually fully dry at the end of a cycle!

They had great advice about everything from where to get a pizza on Sunday night to the best viewing place for the Canada Day fireworks. Two things keep this from being an 'excellent' rating: the elevators and the location. There are only two small elevators in the building, which the staff and guests grumble about equally. Since we were on the 16th floor, stairs were not an option, and there was usually a very long wait. The location is not bad for getting around - we could walk or catch the Metro to anywhere we wanted - but it is not in one of the nicer neighborhoods.

There were panhandlers and drunks on the streets in the evening - no trouble, but I wouldn't want to be walking alone.

The pluses are the AMC Forum is nearby so you can see great movies in a colossal theater and the Atwater Metro is right across from the Forum.

All in all not a bad place with a great staff and adequate rooms.", "Date": "January 6, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn Montreal Westmount", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d281178-Reviews-Residence_Inn_Montreal_Westmount-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$185 - $249*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2170 Lincoln Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H3H 2N5</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "281178", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/6a/b4/cc/pool-with-great-view.jpg"}}
