Walking distance from main shopping centres. Reasonable comfortable rooms at reasonable price. Nice buffet breakfast. Ground floor disco which is usually noisy at nights. Personally I found it disturbing. Plus this place tends to be flooded with Russian prostitutes at nights. Strickly speaking, hotel policy does not allow any visitors in the guest rooms, off the record it does happen. Hard to find a taxi in the mornings, until 10AM. Reception staff can be busy at times and you might have to sit there in front of them, waiting to have a word. Overall it's a reasonable hotel in the city centre.
