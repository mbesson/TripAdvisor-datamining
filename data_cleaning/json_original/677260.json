I am giving this hotel a \"very good\" rating. The hotel has a great masculine vibe from the lobby all the way up to the rooms. The property is in a good location within walking distance to the Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, and good restaurants and shops. I found all of the hotel staff to be very friendly and accommodating. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I received free internet, but even if I were paying out of pocket, internet was only $9.95/ day. Also received a $12/ day breakfast allowance which made for a nice breakfast each morning. The hotel bed was also very comfortable. The onsite restaurant, Juno, is not bad, but is also nothing super special. I would say it is standard hotel food; no better, no worse. The front desk staff and the all of the gentlemen at the concierge desk were very helpful. I was super impressed with just how genuine everyone seemed. It was evident to me that this property really stresses customer service with their staff. For anyone concerned about hotel security, this is the place to stay. Anything above the 3rd floor requires a hotel key for entry 24/7. Staff is always present and would immediately recognize anything out of the ordinary. Lastly, as a word of caution, the hotel is on a bit of an incline, so walking to and from in the area is taxing for someone not accustomed to walking much. That is not just true of the hotel, but of basically anything above 2nd Avenue downtown.

Warm service, cozy rooms, and excellent HHonors recognition have made this our new weekend getaway hotel in downtown Seattle. Location: Situated in the south end of downtown Seattle, The Arctic Club is at least 5 blocks away from most Seattle attractions and many of the more centralized downtown hotels - yet downtown Seattle is so small that it's only a 10-15 minute walk to Pike Place Market. Unless you absolutely have to be in the heart of downtown I wouldn't let the hotel's location deter you from staying. Property: The property itself evokes the feel of the old members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club it used to be with a cozy historic ambience. The Polar Bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c located adjacent the lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was the perfect place to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail. The bartender was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a sharp gentleman who knows how to make a good cocktail. Juno Restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c located downstairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has a warm modern Northwest style and features excellent Northwest-themed breakfast entrees (Dungeness Crab eggs benedict, for example). The rest of the property was well kept, despite its age, with a slight enjoyable quirkiness (walrus decor and random old photos of former Arctic Club members). Room: We were upgraded, without asking, from our cheapest available room to a king corner room with balcony and whirlpool tub. The room itself, consistent with most rooms here I imagine, was slightly cramped but nicely decorated in keeping with the rest of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The bathroom was nicely sized and featured the Doubletree-standard Crabtree and Evelyn line of products. The king bed was quite comfortable and featured Doubletree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sweet Dreams mattress. In short, this was probably the nicest non-suite room of any Doubletree property I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever visited. Overall, a great value for the weekend rate we paid. Service: Excellent warm and caring service throughout \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the high points of our stay.

The bed/linens were extremely comfortable and this place must be built for the zombie apocalypse since we heard no noises (other than some street noise.) The in-room amenities included a full set up to make french press coffee and a minibar. The bath had gorgeous tile.

You look out over the beautiful ballroom but the outside ceiling is just ugly and the view of the air conditioning units is just depressing. We were happy to be moved the next day to room 415... this is at least across the hall from the elevators (we weren't disturbed by foot traffic) ... and you have the view of the buildings across the street but it was brighter ... and felt happier.

The 3rd street entrance has no doorman and is very confusing for those who do not know the plan.

If you are parking a car here, TAKE NOTE. There is only valet parking and it cost 39.00 including tax to park the car for one night. Not as high as Manhattan, but it is a big city, so while I knew it would cost us, I guess I just didn't think it would be so much.

This hotel most definitely has more of a boutique feel to it than a chain property. While it is an older, historical building, it is extremely clean and well kept. I just couldn't get over how \"dark\" it felt though. There is a business \"center\" off the lobby, which is really just part of the lobby area, partioned off by panels. The internet in the lobby is free as is the printer. In the room, they do have wi-fi and if you are a Hilton Honors member, it is supposed to be free.

The bathroom was huge with a nice tub and upscale toiletries. Very luxurious room. I found it odd that they hid the coffee pot in the dresser, but it was convenient to have in the morning when we were getting ready to leave. There was a large desk and the room came with a very nice high-def flat screen TV. The cable wasn't working and they had someone in the room within 5 minutes to fix it.

There is a business center and fitness room at this hotel but I did not have time to check out either one. There is also a public parking lot next door to the hotel which might be less expensive than the valet service.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cToo far from downtown.

We arrived at midnight after 24 hours travelling to be greeted by Michael, who was very welcoming and friendly. It was a great indication that this was going to be a good hotel. We also got warm cookies at check in, which is a very nice touch. Bedrooms are spacious and very clean, the bed is very comfortable! It has everything you might need, even a stapler, highlighter and cellotape. There is a minbar located inside a press which was a bit noisy when the chiller kicked in. When you have jet lag this can really become an issue, the fridge is quite noisy itself but then it vibrates the cabinet handles aswell which can grate on you after 10 nights. The bathroom was very spacious and clean. Breakfast at Juno's was nice, smoothie was delicious and french toast was nice. The polar bar was nice, had a pool table which was good. Drinks are a bit expensive but is probably the case with most hotels. 2 dollars for pint in Belltown or 6 dollars in the hotel. The hotel is located at the bottom of downtown, not too far from shopping area, maybe 10 minutes or so. But if you wanted to go to Belltown or Capitol hill it'd be a far enough walk. There are buses available, but most times we prefer walking places so if we were going back to Seattle we would probably choose a hotel closer to the other end of downtown so the other areas are more accessible by foot. Also in the immediate area of the hotel location there seem to be a higher number of homeless people around than other areas. We didn't encounter any issues with anybody but it can be a bit disconcerting. The hotel is right opposite a light rail stop, which gets to the airport for 2.75, definitely use this instead of getting a taxi. As with alot of hotels you have to pay for Wifi in your room, 10 dollars a night. Its free in reception area, and there are 2 computers available for guest use. You can get free WiFi in Starbucks, I think its a bit unreasonable to ask your guests who have already paid alot to stay in your hotel to pay 10 dollars a night. Overall this is an excellent hotel, all of the staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful and certainly made me feel welcome. The bedrooms are excellent and provided everything we expected from a great hotel.

Located close to the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s center, the Arctic Club is within easy walking distance to many restaurants, museums, and Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous Pike Place Market. The elegantly understated interior is designed to evoke the ambiance of early 20th century exploration and is replete with portraits of Arctic explorers, maps of the Northwest Passage, and stately chairs and tables reminiscent of the era. Just past the lobby is the Polar Bar, which perfectly exemplifies the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to provide luxury without taking itself too seriously. The Polar Bar, full of deep, comfortable chairs, cloth napkins and polished silver, has a drunken polar bear as its emblem. Our room, though small, was very well appointed. Many amenities were incorporated into the room, including some that we had never before seen in a hotel room. As well as such common things as a coffee maker, hair dryer and ice bucket, we found tea, a loose tea strainer, and a French press. In addition to the large flat screen television, there was a DVD player and a stereo system complete with CD player. The writing desk was stocked with such office basics as a stapler, scotch tape, scissors, rubber bands and a calculator \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no need to go to the office center. Robes and a safe awaited us in the closet, as well as a large umbrella (this is Seattle, after all). The mini-bar was fully stocked with an array of beverages from champagne to sodas to fruit juices, and there was a basket of snacks that included an impressive array of choices. To their credit, the hotel made it clear that these items were not included in the cost of the room, but did so in an unobtrusive manner (again, their elegant understatement came through). Upon check-in, we were told that we could empty out the mini-bar to make room for anything that we might want to keep refrigerated, a welcome change from the old-style mini-bars that automatically charge you if anything inside is moved. The bathroom was surprisingly roomy, and was designed for comfort and class. The towels were plush and thick, the bathtub jetted. A marble countertop graced the vanity, which had ample storage underneath. The bathroom door was charming, and included a frosted pane in the upper half. This proved to be one of the very few drawbacks, as it allowed light to spill into the main room (only an issue when one of us was in bed before the other). The staff was extremely courteous and knowledgeable about the area. We were given many wonderful recommendations regarding everything from where to dine to modes of transportation to things to see and do. When they discovered that I was on a hunt for one particular item, the front desk staff took it upon themselves to call three different stores that they thought might carry it, and they checked with me upon my return to the hotel that evening to ensure that my quest had been successful. The housekeeping staff, too, was wonderfully warm, courteous and thorough; our room was kept in tip-top shape throughout our stay. Many small details were attended to that really distinguish this hotel as a top-notch place to stay: a hand-written note welcoming us to our room, a variety of teas (not just black, but green and herbal as well), warm cookies upon our arrival.

Immediately upon entering the hotel, we felt as though we could have been entering a gentleman's city club. The architecture, both inside and out, was a joy to view in contrast to today's bland buildings. Just past the reception and front desk area, where mens' starched collars and top hats were displayed in glass cases, was a large lobby containing numerous club chairs, ottomans, and sofas flanking an large wood paneled fireplace. A long, illuminated bar with fixed stools reminiscent of an elegant bygone era, was a centerpiece in the room. Our quiet, corner room didn't offer much of a view, other than the Columbia Tower building and the top of the hotel's glass ballroom dome, however the very comfortable couch and bed more than made up for the lack of scenery. The bathroom was very large for hotel standards, and after 26 days of cruise ship showers, I luxuriated in a tub once again. We found the hotel staff to be friendly and accommodating. The concierge took his time to make sure our interests in the city were pointed out and marked on a map he provided to us. As always, with Hilton hotels, internet is an additional cost, which I find very disappointing.

Location Fine for Most Activities But Be Prepared For Hills\u201d", "Author": "captnk", "ReviewID": "UR110400068", "Content": "Stayed four nights at the Doubletree before a cruise. We came in late 10:30PM and I had requested a room on a higher floor. The front desk was friendly and apologized that they only had a 2nd floor room available but I could move for the remainder of the stay. The 2nd floor is really the main floor and the room was approximately just above head level for outside pedestrians who walked up the steep Cherry St. Thus it was somewhat noisy. The room was large, well appointed, dark, and very clean. The next day we asked to be switched and after some adjustments received a room on the 6th floor on the back of the hotel. It was next to the elevator and had some noise but preferable to the previous room. I would suggest the back of the hotel for quiet but you would forgo a view. We took the light rail into the hotel from the airport. The Doubletree is located less than a 1/2 block from the James Street entrace of the Pioneer Square Station. Quite a savings from a taxi or shuttle from Sea-Tac as long as you don't mind wheeling luggage a ways at the airport. We rented a cart for $4 which eased the burden. The Doubletree is easy walking distance to Pioneer Square and some other locations. The tallest building in Seattle (Columbia Center) is a block up the hill and has a great view but I'm afraid other reviewers have underestimated walks particularly to Pike Street Market. You have to be in good shape for these walks. While it is downhill to many places,coming back requires average shape at least. My wife has trouble with leg pains so we had to be aware of those issues. If somewhat says its 5 or 10 minutes away, be prepared to double that time on the hills. This is not the hotel's fault just a hint. Except in one case, the front desk personnel were extremely helpful in finding transportation and making recommendations. We took the bus from the 3rd Avenue entrace to Space Needle for $0.75 each. We used taxis and we came back from Pike Street by light rail from the Westlake Center. The only problem we had in trransportion was regarding going to the cruise port. I asked the bellman to call a cab for the trip. There was some commotion and discussion regarding prearranged rides as we waited. The bellman soon came back and put us in a black SUV which was surprising since most people got taxis. The driver seemed peeved but loaded us. As I thought about the conversation, it was apparent that someone had made a mistake and loaded a larger group into a taxi just before us. We had a nice ride to the cruise terminal but the cost of $30 was likely double a metered taxi rate from my previous experience. It would have been nice to be informed of that fact before entering. Still, all in all the staff was cordial, knowledgeable and halpful. Fine/waterfront dining is not too close to the Doubletree. There is the hotel restaurant which we did not try. For breakfast, I would recommend either Piroshkis on 3rd which is just two doors down on 3rd Avenue or either the food courts at Columbia Tower where there are several coffee/bake shoppes including Starbucks. McCormicks and Schmidts Fish House is located in the Columbia Tower as well.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, FL", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel...staff is AMAZING!\u201d", "Author": "TheFiveOs", "ReviewID": "UR110276753", "Content": "We stayed at the Doubletree Artic Club when we were in Seattle for a wedding. We had reservations for five nights, but ended up staying only four due to missing a connecting flight. The staff there couldn't have been more wonderful, especially considering that we called late on what was supposed to be our night of arrival to tell them that we weren't going to make it. When we finally arrived the next day, they had a room ready for us around noon, which was three or four hours earlier than check in time, too. The front desk staff were just wonderful, and so friendly! They always had a smile, great attitude, and helpful advice. They were wonderful when we needed a cab due to a downpour, and even took our photo when we were waiting for the cab, in our wedding attire! The front desk always had apples (and cookies!) at the ready, too. The lobby and the rooms at the hotel were lovely. It was built in the early 1900's, and recently went through a historic renovation. The feel is kind of like a men's club, leather, rich fabric, and soft, comfy furniture. The bar is really nice, and serves food as well. There are comfy chairs and couches in the lobby, along with a fireplace. There was also a couple of computers with internet access, which was nice, as I didn't really want to pay for the wifi, since I was on vacation and tried not to go online!! Our room had a lovely, large bathroom with a beautiful marble topped vanity and a tub that was deep enough for a nice bath. The bed was super comfy, with nice, soft sheets and down bedding. We had no isses regulating the temperature, either. One day, we got back to our room in the early evening and realized that we'd accidentally left the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door handle. When I called the front desk to ask for some fresh towels, they insisted it was no problem to send someone to come up and clean the room, which they did quickly and efficiently. One other great perk is the location. The light rail is literally right across the street, so it only cost a few dollars to go to the airport! We planned to do a lot of walking, and didn't want to rent a car. The hotel was 3 blocks from the water, and probably a ten minute walk from Pike's Place. Pioneer Square is about a five minute walk. The Space Needle, and the nicer shopping area (Nordstroms, Macy's, etc.) is probably a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. For us, it was a great location! I would say that our stay ranks with stays we've had at Ritz Carlton's and other luxury hotels, with the cost considerably less, which is great! We were thrilled with the service, location, quality and accessibility.

The bed was comfortable with very fluffy soft pillows, which I like, but there were other pillows in the closet and I am sure housekeeping would be happy to bring up firmer pillows.

My only complaint was minor, and it was because there was another wedding reception the night before and we could *kind of* hear the music from the ballroom in our room. However, it shut down at 11 and then all was well. This minor inconvenience would definitely not stop me from staying here again, as the service and facilities were all top notch.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with lots of History & Character\u201d", "Author": "topgun151", "ReviewID": "UR89791931", "Content": "Character counts.

It has a wonderfully unique old-fashioned explorer-type decor with a huge seating area past the lobby and a cool bar, and you can literally see the Pioneer Square station from the front door down 3rd Ave. We found it very convenient (you can take the Link from SEA airport directly to the Pioneer Square station, about 40 mins., then walk across up the street to the hotel). We also used the Link again to get from the hotel back to the airport. The staff was quick to help us with our bags up and down the stairs outside the lobby, and they were very friendly over the phone before we arrived and also during our stay. We were easily able to walk from here to Pike Street market and the waterfront, and the bus system was very good for getting to spots a little north of downtown since the hotel is inside the \"free ride\" area (e.g., Seattle Center). You definitely don't need to rent a car to get to/from the hotel with your bags, or around town. There is no Hilton Honors lounge, but the breakfast and service in the restaurant downstairs was very good and the vouchers were enough to get a very filling meal each morning. We had a balcony room with a sofa, nice TV, large bathroom w/ whirlpool, and a nice view from the balcony toward the stadium. I especially liked the pull out tray coffee/tea station that we used to make hot tea and French-pressed coffee each morning. The view out of the large windows is somewhat blocked by the surrounding buildings and the building facade, but from our balcony, you could still sneak a view of the Space Needle and see plenty of sky for the sunset, which we thought was really nice. There were also chairs on the balcony. The hotel wasn't crowded at all (we stayed over a long weekend), our floor was very quiet, and the management was kind enough to send us a bottle of wine when I mentioned that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary! We appreciated the gesture, and we'll be staying here again for sure on our next visit to Seattle.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cA Lovely Experience, Exceeded Expectations\u201d", "Author": "Suomessa", "ReviewID": "UR86995284", "Content": "This is just a beautiful hotel, completely different to the normal Hilton chain experience with its unique architecture and interior design.

Service was generally very good, from check in to the ordering of taxis. The room + breakfast deal was a bit stingy but that is typical of the Hilton chain and there were enough good things to offset that small irritation. The room was not huge but it was well appointed. The bathroom was almost as big as the room itself and had a nice, old fashioned feel to it. In terms of location, it is about 10 minutes to Pike Market and a bunch of other stores like Maceys. It seemed like a good position, not too close to the crowds but close enough to walk without a big hassle. There is a really nice, spacious lobby bar as well, which looked like a great place to meet people before going out. Overall, staying here gave me a great first impression of Seattle and the staff made me feel very much at home. If I could have stayed longer, I would have and while the price was not super cheap, I thought it very fair for the quality of the hotel.

When we arrived, we loved the old 30's vintage feel of it. The lobby was cool, the staff was so friendly and helpful. We loved the bar area and and absinthe theme (the bf tried an absinthe drink at one point ;), we LOVEd the fireplace with te red couches right by it. We had a couple drinks and hung out by there. There's also a pool table behind the couches. Our room was cozy. We didn't expect a crazy huge suite. We came to Seattle to explore and sightsee, not to sit inside the hotel room and focus on every corner and crease. I don't get that about the people posting reviews on here about hotels. They come visit a city and spend most of the time complaining about how the paint was chipped in the corner by the door, WHO CARES??!. Anyway, we had a flat screen tv, which we watched a couple times, but like I said, we spent most of the time exploring the city. The room was a little bit too dim, but that didn't bother us much. The bathroom was a good size and we had everything we needed. The room was cleaned everyday and everyone was so helpful and friendly! Th beds were VERY comfortable-we had a good nights rest every night. Our view wasn't awesome, but again, we didn't care! It didnt make our trip bad in any way. The area itself around the hotel was more businessy, not too many on the streets. That was good though, we came back to our hotel when we were ready to relax and go to bed. When we wanted to party and go out and meet people we drove to Capitol Hill or more downtown area. All in all, the hotel was awesome. We would stay there again. We absolutely loved Seattle (we were surprised of how steep the streets were-we didn't know it was San-Fransisco style streets). Helpful Hint: RENT A CAR! We stayed for 5 days and it helped us out so much. Parking was easy (on streets), getting around was very easy (according to my Magellan boyfriend anyway-he drove). People are amazing.

Getting around the downtown area of the city was easy with the free bus service that runs from early morning to the evening. Pike's place is about 8-10 blocks, no problem for those who love the walking. Seaside dining is close too. We stayed during the week so didn't have a problem finding things that were open in this area. Basically, if you are up for walking around this location is fine. If you need to step out your door and be in the middle of tourist town then find something closer to Pike's Place. Also, we took the train from the airport for $1.50. It stops literally across the street from the hotel. I think it's the Pioneer Square stop. SO easy to get back to the airport. The ride is about 20-30 minutes.

I don't know what I missed at the Hilton but this hotel is either riding on its past laurels or other reviewers have been smoking something. First off, the service was INDIFFERENT. We called in the morning of our arrival requesting an early check-in and the answer was \"well, you know we don't guarantee this sort of thing, just show up and see\". We got there around 1pm and there was no one at the door except for wedding photographer taking shots of the groom on the elegant but steep 19th century marble steps at the Cherry Street entrance. No one to help with the luggage nor any signs to suggest the friendlier alternative ground level entrance around the corner on 3rd Avenue. At check-in we did get the customary Doubletree cookies were promptly asked to wait pending a phone call. We chose to camp out in the totally deserted lobby. At least it was dark and cool (on a rare warm sunny Seattle day). At about 3:10 (so much for early check-in, even the \"official\" check in time was 3:00pm) having received no phone call, I stepped up to the desk and was checked in without fuss. Ok, not a big deal but certainly not the service level I expected after the ratings on this site. The hotel room itself was ridiculously small, I'm guess it is no more than 10'x10'. One half of the dresser stayed locked (I suspected it was a minibar and I didn't want to bother running a perpetual argument with our 9 year old, so I didn't bother to ask). The other half had drawers which could not be opened if you had the drop top down for the coffee center on top. I don't think I've stayed in a smaller room in Manhattan. Our room in particular had two large double-hung windows, except unfortunately, the room was located facing a notch in the building footprint so the view was that of a blank wall. The bed linens were outstanding, especially the down pillows. The modern double-paned windows, excellent climate control, and an interior location on a high floor on a weekend downtown meant that sleep quality was outstanding. The bathroom on the other hand was very spacious, tastefully decorated, and was better situated so we had (partial) views of the Seattle public library which is two blocks north. The mosaic tile floor and the marble vanity were nice touches. I understand the need to conserve water and most hotels in this class have adjustable heads that trade off water flow and pressure. However, this shower was one of those \"rain bath\" affairs - about a 8\" wide head with acceptable water volume but not enough pressure and no adjustments. In terms of location it IS very convenient to the transit tunnel but compared to other downtown Seattle hotels, that is about the ONLY advantage. This part of downtown has nothing next to it other than the City Hall and the County Courthouse and a huge empty block - presumably something interesting will eventually fill that space. But most of the shopping and touristy attractions are up further north towards the Westlake center area, or south towards Pioneer Square (which is not far). We did not use the fitness center but there is no swimming pool, which is not uncommon for older hotels of this vintage. On Sunday night there was nothing open close by for dinner so we had to take the bus uptown (which is NOT free after 7pm). On Monday we found a decent Thai place on Second Avenue - great prices after all $25-$30 per person places over the weekend. I would also recommend the Vietnamese sandwich shop whose name escapes me now but is near 2nd and James, NOT the one on Cherry & 3rd which is twice as expensive. Pick up a couple of banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) - we had the grilled pork and the chicken and they were both very good and a steal at $2.75. They did give us a late check out (till 2pm) without fuss and stored our bags till we took the train to the airport in the evening. All in all an unobtrusive hotel, nothing really wrong about it but I am giving it fewer points to balance what I perceive is an overrated rating but other reviewers.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dungarvan", "Title": "\u201cno problems would love to go back\u201d", "Author": "hourigan1", "ReviewID": "UR77249656", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in early august.

We were given a room out the back to try and get a room that wasnt noisy - the room looked over a back parking lot and the airconditioning unit so it was nearly as noisy as being at the front. As we were there for 5 days this was really disappointing in a pretty city like Seattle. The hotel is situated on the border of new downtown and old downtown which is not bad and there are free buses covering the downtown area. The decor is based on the hotel once being an exclusive club for men in the early 1900's. It is dark and dour and victorian and seems to consist mainly of dull photos of men dressed in suites plastering all the walls. The restuaurant has a limited menu and was expensive. The room was small and dull and as I said had NO aspect. We did get a call about the room asking was it ok but no offer was made to move us somewhere better or upgrade us.

It was also somewhat noisy especially early on Saturday morning when the jackhammers started. On the whole we were very happy with the facilities. The people were even better. They went out of their way to help us with directions, suggestions, and whatever else we might need. We felt the location was excellent. We took the light rail from the airport for $2.50, got off at the Pioneer Square stop, went up the escalator and walked out right across the street from the hotel. We walked a lot and some of the uphill stretches were evil. The Pioneer Square and International Districts are very convenient and both have a lot of places to eat. Public transportation is free from 6am-7pm in a large central section of the city. There are buses outside the hotel as well as in the transit tunnel where the light rail stops. Folks at the desk will give you a print out of your route or connections.

As for the hotel itself, we especially enjoyed the historic charm and comfortable beds. Rooms are nicely finished and furnished with nice touches like in room coffee using a French press coffeemaker. We've seen some renovations in which the only thing left of the building was something on the order of a paved-over shell, but the Arctic Club celebrates its history throughout -- from historic photographs of its former members on the keycards to careful refinishing and preservation of its finest attributes. The result is 21st Century comfort with an ambiance that keeps the property's past vibrant and alive. We loved it and we think you will, too. Give the Juno dining room a try and particularly the happy hour food offerings at half price. It's a funky menu the celebrates the Pacific Northwest, but you're sure to find something you like.

The concierge team were also very helpful in ensuring that I had a good time in Seattle by offering me a map and suggestions for things to do in the city in such a short space of time. I had to leave the city early in the morning and the hotel promptly gave me a wake-up call and offered me a car to drive me to the airport at 5am, this was at a cost of $40. The room I was allocated was of an adequate size bearing in mind that I was a solo traveller, if travelling with another person, I would imagine that the room would feel smaller than most hotels. The bathroom had an old world charm about it with wallpaper on the walls and a classic cosy feel. I was on a higher floor, however, it was still possible to hear the street noise which was a little off putting at times but it didn't spoil my stay. I did not use the lobby lounge but it had a warm 'gentleman's club' type feel with classic furniture, soft lighting, which for me, made the hotel feel intimate unlike other hotels I have stayed in.

Nice entry foyer, with desk, living room, tall ceilings, three windows (that actually open!) Comfortable chairs. Huge bathroom, with jacuzzi tub. Great view of Mt. Ranier from the bathroom.

There was a flat-panel TV too (but we never turned it on -- too much to see and do in Seattle, plus we were there for the Rodrigo y Gabriela concert at the Moore Theater.)

The hotel itself is classic men's club that has been converted into a stylish hotel while maintaining (or, more likely, recreating) the ambience of such a club. A lot of effort went into the decorating and it was worth it. The furniture in my room had a vaguely art deco feel to it. The bed was extra comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and very attractive (they had, once again, gone to considerable effort to make it both very modern but esthetically keyed to the period of the club itself). I didn't try the restaurants or the bar, but the latter looked quite inviting. Some huge party was going on when I checked in but my room itself was quiet. One oddity which I am sure was just a bit of bad luck: when I arrived at my room after checking in, the door was propped open. I used my key to confirm that I wasn't going to the wrong room (I wasn't) and then I checked the room and everything was in order. I then locked and bolted the door. Still, it was a bit unsettling. While common, I note that they charged for Internet access, something I consider gratuitous and annoying (especially since more basic hotels almost always offer it for free these days).

Of course, I was also given my warm Doubletree cookie which I had thinking about my entire drive to Seattle from Portland. :o) The expedition/travel themed hotel has been beautifully converted. Designers have paid homage to original Arctic Club members by hanging their portraits throughout the hotel. I love the attention to architectural detail as well, lines are very clean and I felt like I had stepped into the 1920s or another bygone era. The famous walrus facade is complemented with walruses throughout the building--from room numbers to bar napkins. I love how the them is carried throughout. My room was small, but that is to be expected in a historic building. The room was tastefully appointed, with clean lines and very masculine tones like dark wood and muted colors (a common theme throughout the hotel). My room was on the 9th floor, and unlike a previous reviewer, I did not notice a significant enough amount of street noise to prevent a restful stay. I could hear planes departing SeaTac/Boeing field, but it was not annoying. I also do not notice an abundance of street noise. Maybe because it is a Sunday night, or maybe because I live in a city and I am used to it? Not sure, at this moment, all I really hear is the hum of an air conditioning unit. The hotel is within walking distance of the waterfront, Pike Street Market and Pioneer Square. You could even walk to SafeCo and Qwest Fields on a game day. While there are hills on the way back from any of these destinations, the climb is short (only a couple blocks). Very do-able. I did not try the restaurant, Juno, but did eat at the Polar Bar. Food was excellent, atmosphere was delightful and service was superb. The only draw back to the hotel, that I have found so far, is the immediate surroundings. On a Sunday afternoon, everything around the hotel was closed. I walked to the Seattle's Best a block and a half away and even that was closed on Sundays! A coffee shop in Seattle closed?!

Would highly recommend.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "redmond, wa", "Title": "\u201cThe feeling of a private club in a small hotel\u201d", "Author": "feathers1959", "ReviewID": "UR31590569", "Content": "The Arctic Club has successfully captured the feeling of a private club of the Alaska Gold era in Seattle, both from the decor and the service. The rooms are decorated in the gold rush period and have large, soft queen beds, bathrooms are adquate, and the room amenities are great--including the coffee press! The Juno resturant seems to open and close with the seasons, and the menu has gone a bit more mainstream for dinners, recently. Breakfasts are still \"hearty\". The bar scene seemed lively in April of 09.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cWell located, Nice Hotel.

The room (designated a disabled room) was spacious, with a flat floor WC / shower room (no steps). The bed was very comfortable although rather high for a disabled person. Coffee / Tea making available as well as TV / DVD / Radio / CD. Wardrobe contains a safe and ironing board and a low level clothes rail. (oddly no high level rail so long clothes / dresses couldn't be hung up) The Air conditioning fan was extremely noisy - to loud to have on at night. The TV was temperamental in receiving digital channels (which will be all of them after 12 June 2009). When we arrived Wifi internet was available throughout the hotel free of charge, but this stopped half way through the week. (See below) We arrived late on Saturday evening after a flight from London. Staff were helpful & friendly. The next day (Sunday) the area was quiet as it's the Business District. During the week the area is busier. Buses to & from the Retail Core (free until 7pm) run along 3rd Avenue and the are bus stops are right outside the hotel. There is a coffee shop on the opposite corner to the hotel and a Russian bakery next door (both open Mon-Fri only) if you don't fancy the hotel restaurant for breakfast. On the subject of the restaurant, in the course of a week we visited the restaurant 3 times (2 breakfast & 1 dinner). Monday breakfast was OK. Wednesday (note the day) dinner was a disaster. Had to wait an hour for our apetizers then the Entree (main course) arrived about 5 minutes later being placed on the table beside the apetizer plates we were still eating from. Glasses were taken before they had been finished and to top it all 2 of out party found plastic film in their food. Profuse apologies and a free glass of sparking wine followed, but the meal was spoiled. Saturday breakfast service was understaffed and inexperienced. Long waits for food, tables left uncleared and dirty crockery / cutlery provided. Generally the restaurant was hopeless. Half was though our stay (Wednesday) the ownership of the hotel passed to Doubletree, part of the Hilton group. From that moment onward there was a noticable decline in service. Internet connections stopped working (on enquiry I was told that the new owners had decided to charge $10 per day for access - there was no warning of this although it was still free in the lobby); the overnight laundry service took 4 days to return and the restaurant got worse. Not a bad hotel but things did change later in the week.", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Arctic Club Seattle - a DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d677260-Reviews-The_Arctic_Club_Seattle_a_DoubleTree_by_Hilton_Hotel-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$187 - $321*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">700 3rd Ave (corner of Third and Cherry - hotel entrance on Cherry Street)</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98104</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "677260", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/58/cc58500d89693401f45390438e01f3e76large.jpg"}}
