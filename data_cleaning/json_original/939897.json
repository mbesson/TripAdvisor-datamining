Room service is available but no alcohol is served in the hotel, bring your own from duty free.There was a local (inexpensive) restaurant nearby and the hotel also had an adequate restaurant. A supermarket and drug store were close and then there is the rest of Dubai open as anywhere else.

I was a bit annoyed that the receptionist kept asking us to settle the bill even before we went to the room.What if I didn't like the hotel after our first night? Decor was neutral and overall rooms are nicely furnished if not a bit tired . I wasn't overly impressed with their linen or towels as they looked very frailed and hard at touch. Kitchen was nice size and had microwave, kettle, medium size fridge and a wash drier wich was quite handy with young kids.Only problem was that the fuse kept blowing out when I was attempting to iron and run the w/machine at the same time. I was happy with the cleaniness as the room always smelled nice when we came back from our travelling and on a couple of occasions we let the cleaners enter when we were still in the apt and I saw many cleaning products in their trolley . They do not have a swimming poolunlike what I read on previous reviews. They have a small gym on 1st floor but we didn't visit it. The hotel offers free internet access but it isn't wireless and actually proved to be a pain .Every day we had to call reception to get a new log in password and also the speed is so slow..like watching paint dry...very annoying!!!! The location is nowhere near Dubai downtown.You must have a car to reach every turist attraction and unfortunately the traffic is horrible.You have to plan your day starting from 9-10 am.If you hit the road earlier than that you must take into consideration a huge rush hours traffic jam and plenty of queueing.Same in the evening around 5-7 pm. If it wasn't for the value for money I would have stayed somewhere closer to town. It doesn't feel central at all..plenty of sandy empty lots and busy roads is all you will see from the balcony but if you are lucky u might catch sight of the Burj Khalifa at night!!! We were recommended this hotel by our nephew who lives in Sharjia.I guess having family in Dubai makes this hotel value for money cause eventually we visited them a lot but if u come to Dubai on a holiday adventure with young kids I wouldn't mind paying a little extra but be closer to the action!!!", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cNever stay at this hotel\u201d", "Author": "DunesTunes", "ReviewID": "UR90490644", "Content": "We advise if anyone wants value for money,then we suggest not staying at this hotel.Calling for service from this hotel, is never easy.You need to call the front desk for several times before someone can attend to you. Full of craps and sloppy reasons they will give you, each time you call. The location are fine. It is so near and fast to get to the airport. Various restaurants around. The most popular supermarket is Carrefour Express,couple blocks away from the hotel. All of needs for goceries and other daily needs can be found in this supermarket. We heard some locals like going to Al Madina Supermarket and West supermarket.There are two hospitals.One is Zulaika Hospital and the other is NMC Hospital which is next to the hotel. They were good to us when we first arrive.After months of staying with them,they give us such a bad treatment. For the record, the filipinos guys n gals give extra attention and hospitality to the middle east people,especially the men. But if you are from any other nationality beside the Gulf or the Middle East, then look out. There will give you limited attention and hospitality. One good example are us. We get fewer and fewer attention from them,each day for the last 3 months we been there with them.

I have paid less and had better services from many other hotels. A week before arriving at the hotel I emailed them and requested a baby cot. I said i was willing to bring our travel cot if they didnt have any. I was reassured that there would be a cot available and not to worry. I was also told breakfast was complimentary. Well, we arrived at the hotel on the 20th March and noticed that the hotel was somewhat overcrowded and that reception were not particularly welcoming. Our two-bedroom suite was on the 12th floor which we didnt mind, and was really the highlight of our stay. We had every comfort we needed in our suite and the state of furniture/decor was perfect. In fact it was the best suite we ever stayed in. The kitchen had every facility and provision - just as we would have in our own home (minus the food of course ;) HOWEVER, there was no baby cot. In fact no cot arrived even though i kept being assured one was on its way. in fact, a mattress turned up at 1am at night, with my toddler happily bouncing around for most of the night. It was really upsetting. The hotel now admitted there were no cots available, and insisted that i should be happy with the mattress especially as they werent charging me for it. WELL, a baby cot would have been complimentary anyway, so yes it should be free at no extra charge. The next morning we went down to breakfast - and what a disappointement. no plates left, no cutlery, no juice, no tea and barely any food. Many people were left disappointed as there really wasnt anything to eat. After I complained and threatened to take it up with the manager, they started to send in some scraps, but by then we were really put off. The hotel was not at the standard of a 4 star. in terms of service - very poor, probably 1 or 2 maximum. the suite was very nice and yes probably 4 star. You need to decide which is more important. Personally I will not return there again, even though we had the perfect suite. The hotel is on a building site and while we heard no noise, the surroundings arent very pleasant. A very nice restaurant just down the road - Karachi Durbar that sells asian food at good prices. As for the hotel, i would not recommend it.
