The check in was excellent, efficient and the young lady was charming, helpful and accommodating when I asked for a high floor with a view.

The apartment was modern, large, nicely presented, with full kitchenette, king bed, lounge area and table & chairs. Abundant light from many windows, most of which did in fact afford much more than a glimpse of Darling Harbour. The bathroom was quite large and efficient with the inclusion of washing machine & dryer. The bedroom can be closed off from the main area by closing large sliding doors. One minor criticism - a relatively small LCD TV . Very pleasant bar/breakfast restaurant on first floor if you choose it - we made breakfast in our apartment at our leisure. The location is sensational! 1 small block from all the eating,drinking and festivities of Darling Harbour, and similar distance to the Queen Vic Building, central city and Town Hall railway station. Pleasant walking distance from Circular Quay and the Rocks for exploring on foot. Many wonderful pubs & small 7/11 style shops to buy in your breakfast requirements in close proximity.We had no car but there is a parking station next door - you would need to check the rates.

Where the mini bar is missing, it is important to note, that there are many bars, convenience stores and bottleshops open late in and around the immediate area, so this shouldn't cause a problem to most guests. In the rooms I have stayed, there have been a washer and dryer, which at the end of a multi-leg trip can be a real bonus, particularly when inclement weather causes you to use more changes of clothes than you were planning.

We ordered room service on our first night and it was promptly delivered and was fairly tastey. We were disappointed with the room, not only was it quite dirty, we had booked a \"1 bedroom\" apartment, but it wasn't a one bedroom, it was really a studio with a funny sliding door around the bedroom. As we were travelling with our 8 month old, we really need 2 separate areas so she wouldn't be interupted while she slept. This room layout meant we pretty much had to go to sleep when she did. The \"king\" bed was actually 2 single matresses put together and you could feel the bump in the middle which made it quite uncomfortable. The kitchenette was adequate, with everything you needed to cook a meal, including pots, serving dishes, crockery, cuttlery, even a potato masher :) The room had a laundry, but no washing machine. On the first morning I asked if there was somewhere to do some washing, I was told I could use another room when I needed to. However, when I returned from my walk, there was a washing machine in the laundry which was great. The hot water, both in the bathroom and the kitchenette, took at least 10 minutes to start heating up. But once it came through it was fine and it never ran out. On our final night one of our neighbours decided to come home around 3am and start singing and carrying on, I called down to reception and someone was up knocking on their door within 5 minutes - another great customer service experience. We requested a late check out, which was granted for free until midday, but after this we would be charged $20/hour up until 3pm, and thereafter we would be charged a full day's rate.
