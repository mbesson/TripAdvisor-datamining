First off it is a brothel, and filled with meth/crack heads. I have no idea how this place passes any inspections. I was going to a couple of shows at the Congress theater, and this place is the closest place to it, so I thought I'd try it out even though the reviews were bad. When we first walked in we had to talk to a guy behind a window and pay, then we were buzzed though another door where we had to go up stairs battling crack heads on the way up. When I got to my room I looked around and found out that I was sharing a bathroom with the room next door, which had some shady charactars in it. I would have never trusted my belongings in my room with only a plywood door between us. Then I sat on the bed and realized it was covered in plastic sheets under the covers. I looked at the plastic sheets and they were plastic wrap with duct tape. The sheets were also full of awsome yellow stains. Luckily we were given a refund and did not have to stay, otherwise I would probably not have been able to written this because I would have been kidnapped and sold into a lifetime of male erotic sexual slavery.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cDon't take the bad reviews too seriously\u201d", "Author": "berrygudz", "ReviewID": "UR46044883", "Content": "After reading the reviews online about this hotel, anyone would think this is a horrible place to stay. The reality, however, is that it really isn't that bad! My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by our experience here. If you're looking for a poshy place to stay, this is not it. But if you're looking for hostel quality, you'll like it here just as we did.

Cockroaches everywhere, smells nasty, Mrs Roper receptionist, doubles as brothel, dirtiest hotel I have every seen, broken doors, old food that looked like a mix of cigarette butts and corn in the plant in front of our door, fat shirtless white trash guy maintenance man with a knife on his belt, no towel or soap in bathroom, brown bloodstained shower. The guy who showed us our room asked if we were having a \"party\" We checked out quicker than it took for us to check in and they wouldn't give us our money back until the boss showed up the next day so we had to take a special cab ride back to the place. We explained to the local Cab driver that we refused to stay there because we didn't want to wake up to someone with a knife over our bed.

The receptionist is hidden behind a glass wall, the announcements on the walls are written with a pen and she has to buzz you in to get into the hotel lobby. The place smells bad, the elevator is probably the original (1930's?).When we got to the room it took us 5 minutes to open the two locks. When we removed the cover sheet, the linens were yellow and I mean spotted yellow. When I looked in a tray, on the dresser, which had our toilet paper, a couple of cockroaches where running around in circles.. When I opened the blinds, which were dusty, I couldn't see much outside because of the dust and mud that covered the windows. And also the windows are \"beautifully\"arranged with some blue duct tape. Now the bathroom. Full of cockroaches, the shower is dripping and you cannot lock the bathroom window which overlooks a scary backyard. We stayed 5 minutes in the room and we took off checking out but not before noticing the red carpet with an inch of dust and some announcements that were letting you know not to run in the hallways or \"no going in other people's rooms\"!!!
