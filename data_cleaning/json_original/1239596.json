The hotel has a restaurant attached and we had a very pleasant, if quite expensive breakfast here. There are many other restaurants for evening meals. Everything is about the same price as London.

It is a small yet comfortable area where you can relax with a nice view, a good glass of wine and staff that takes care of you. For those who travel as much I do a wonderful treat! The location is great. For those who love the action and huge selection you are in the right area BUT you will find the quite and cosy places along the Singapore river heading the other direction.

I found the Park Hotel Clarke Quay to be a poor choice in comparison. Our room was very small with little space for anything. The overall dimensions of the main room could have been little more than 3m x 2.5m and into that space they'd crammed a double bed, bedside cabinets, a desk and one armchair. In fairness its in very tasteful design and co-ordinates well with the wood panelling. In keeping with this general lack of living space, the wardrobe was only about 75 cm wide and not really up to storing more than a wekend or three day stay's clothing. I don't think it would suffice for a week. We had all our luggage piled around the side of the room, because there was nowhere to store it. In direct contrast to the rest of the room , the bathroom was an extremely generous space, with a good sized shower and sink counter. Our rate included breakfast but I'm afraid to say that the fare was pretty tasteless stuff, so it mattered little that there was plenty of it. Fortunately there's a wide range of restaurants in the immediate vicinity, including excellent restaurants and cheap and cheerful food courts. I found the front desk staff to be quite a dour crowd, making minimal eye contact and showing little interest in guests, although the bell boy staff were evry good and the concierge was an excellent source of suggestion for food and entertainment. There's an excellent free shuttle service into town via the Clarke Quay subway station which seems to run to a very reliable timetable. But those points barely justify the room fee charged.

We were late checking in but because we had a Club Room we had a separate check-in desk and the check-in was seamless. Our room on the 10th floor was virtually opposite the Club Lounge where we could get breakfast from 7.00am to 10.30am and then hot and cold drinks with biscuits throughout the day. Then at 5.30pm to 7.30pm alcoholic beverages were served together with a buffet which was substantial enough for us not to want another meal. After 7.30 we could still get drinks. The staff were all extremely attentive and cheerful. Jessica looked after us most of the time and ensured we got what we wanted. Generally all the staff at the Club Lounge were extremely helpful and gave advice when we asked about what to see and do. The breakfast was a variety of eggs, bacon, toast, croissants and Singapore dishes with tea and coffee flowing. The evening buffet was equally good. The hotel was set 5 minutes walk from Clarke Quay and all the shops around the River. Unfortunately the rooms were quite small and we did a bit of juggling with our suitcases. The Reception desk on the ground floor was busy a lot of the time and the staff didn't seem to cope well when it was busy. I didn't realize until we left that the Club rooms used the reception within the Club Lounge. Finally I think the arrangement to use a room facility to freshen up before you depart needs to change. It is on a first come first served arrangement but a booking system I think is needed. The hotel was fully booked on the day of departure and we had to leave our room by 12.00 noon. I understood we could use a hotel room prior to departure but we couldn't book. When we went to use the room (after my swim) at 5.30 pm we were told there were 2 couples in front of us and we couldn't use the room for an hour (6.30).

Location excellent if you're travelling by yourself as I was: perfect for an early-morning jog along the Singapore River and endless options of good bars & restaurants on your doorstep for people-watching over dinner. Not so good points: no wi-fi in rooms (although free wi-fi in reception and by pool). Restaurant is quite small and gets crowded during breakfast.

Upon arrival, Reception Staff could not find our booking, even though we had booked our stay months in advance and presented them with a voucher from Singapore Airlines. Unfortunately rather than explaining this to us, they asked us to sit down in the very busy reception area where they ignored us and kept us waiting for half an hour while they tried to work out what to do. Whilst waiting we witnessed our suitcases go up in the lift with the concierge and when we asked in Reception where they were going, we were told they were going up to our room, even though we hadn't been checked in yet. Unsurprisingly, the bags came back down again and we had to advise the concierge that they were ours. When we asked for the Wi-fi code to access the internet on our phones while we waited, we had to hand our phones over the desk for the receptionist to put the code in. Wi-fi is only available in the Reception area and it was necessary to give the Receptionist your phone everytime as it locks you out when you leave the Reception area. We were offered no apology for our wait or the confusion and also received no welcome or guide to the hotel. We did not expect much from our room as we knew we would be spending most of our time out exploring Singapore. However, we could not help but be disappointed by it's lack of comfort. We had not been given the option to upgrade to the Crystal Club rooms during check-in and had to phone down to Reception enquire about upgrading. We were given the cost but no description of the package or incentive to move. In the end, we decided to stay put and make the most of our time. The room was very small but had everything that we needed for our short stay and was clean. There was no balcony but the wall to wall window gave a lovely view of the beautiful pool. The bathroom was adequate with a brilliant shower. After a long day of travel and another day exploring the city of Singapore, the most important thing for us was to have a place to lay our weary heads and a good night's sleep. Unfortunately this was not possible as the bed was very hard and uncomfortable. Due to bad weather and our short stay we did not get the opportunity to try out the pool area which looked beautiful and well maintained. The hotel has a fantastic location, very close to the buzz of Clarke Quay and has brilliant transport links. The hotel shuttle bus is very useful and out of everyone at the hotel, we found the concierge staff and also the shuttle bus drivers to be the most welcoming and helpful.

We should of asked to be moved to non a smoking floor but we couldn't be bothered as we were only there for one night.

I made a booking months ahead so the rate is not high at all for a hotel of this standard (<S$200 per night plus tax) at this time of the year. We arrived from Sri Lanka by a very early morning flight. With the previous evening being Dec 30 and NY's eve upcoming, I honestly did not expect an early check-in. To our surprise, the reception staff was very accommodating (perhaps noting that we looked horrible after only 2-3 hours' sleep on the flight) and let us have an early check at 10am! The room is very clean, modern, adequate (though I agree it's a bit small for 2 people) and is quiet albeit we actually stayed on the 2nd floor next to the pool! We did not eat there so I can't comment. I did swim and the experience is delightful. Free shuttle service is available to Clarke Quay MRT and Orchard. Though infrequent (around once in an hour) it's good enough for connection to main business and tourist spots without hussle.

They normally walk up and down the river. The hotel has a brilliant pool which we enjoyed relaxing by in the heat! Didn't reckon much to the food though.

And it turned out to be one of the poorest hotels we stayed in. Check-in was torturous as an unsmiling rude receptionist assigned us a twin room which we hadn't requested. After calling down to let them know, we had to take all our luggage back to reception where we were given another room. This room then turned out to be a smoking room after we had requested a non-smoking room. By this point, I gave up as I didn't want to experience more rudeness from the reception staff. On check-out day, we had a late check-out until 3pm which I had confirmed with the reception staff the day before. This was ignored and we were locked out of our room after the standard check-out time. Was there any apology or even a hint of a smile after going back to reception to tell them, no, don't be daft. Perhaps we had become too pampered by the excellent levels of service experienced in the previous weeks around vietnam, laos, and cambodia. The doormen and the cleaners were very friendly in the hotel but as your main point of customer contact, I was very surprised and disappointed to find the reception staff so surly. Other reviewers have commented on the small size of the rooms. I had given the hotel the benefit of the doubt as I thought perhaps they were being compared to american-size hotel rooms which tend to be very large. However, even compared to British hotel rooms, the size of the room was tiny. There wasn't enough room to properly store two suitcases and hand luggage let alone open them. Facilities-wise, the room was as you should expect for a 4* - safe, fridge, tv. However, the one glaring negative is that there is NO wifi. This is exceptionally poor for a hotel of this grade in this day and age. Decor-wise, the room was spartan with a rather stained, shabby carpet. The bathroom did have a nice shower, however. Location-wise, the hotel is close to Clarke Quay (lots of bars and restaurants) and Chinatown. The open-top buses run close to the hotel which is very handy.

While most of our demands were met, we had a few quibbles.... 1) The room size was disappointingly small. 2) The hotel, though across the street is a long walk from the nightlife at Clarke Quay, you have to take a winding road under the bridge to cross the road, which is a good 15 mins walk. 3) The closest MRT station from the hotel is a good 20 mins walk. Considering that is best way to travel in singapore, it was a bit of disappointment to walk that much just to reach the station. But these issues are specific to people who are looking to travel singapore by the public transport system. The hotel pool was really good and big. Definitely worth taking a dip or two.

We chose the Park Hotel because of its proximity to these eating and drinking places in the knowledge that the hotel had a well-reviewed restaurant and they also operate a complimentary shuttle to other places of interest and utility like Orchard Road and local metro stations, etc., so it is always easy to get where you want without resorting to taxis. We opted to upgrade to a \u201cCrystal Club Class\u201d room on the 10th floor which has its own private check-in and lounge where a complementary breakfast can be taken in the morning followed by afternoon tea and, later, snacks and drinks, all included in the upgrade price which makes it a very good deal indeed. A modest amount of laundry is also part of the package and is a great help to any traveler. This Club floor has lovely high-ceilinged rooms and our room had a very comfortable queen-size bed. A little more space for luggage would have been appreciated but for a city-centre hotel it was well thought out and our 3-night stay was very enjoyable. It is little touches like being able to switch the bathroom light on and off from either side of the bed without waking one\u2019s spouse that show how much thought has gone into the room design. We only took dinner in the hotel on one evening because there was so much else to see and do but we chose two typical dishes to share (a Hainanese Chicken & Rice and a Laksa) which were beautifully flavoured and impeccably served. This was preceded by the hotel\u2019s own version of the Raffles-inspired \u201cSingapore Sling\u201d and I am happy to say it compared very favorably with the \u2018real thing\u2019 which we also tasted in Raffles the following day. Food and drink is not cheap in Singapore but the portions were ample and the cost reasonable in context. The public areas in the hotel are very light and spacious, with an efficiently manned reception desk and concierge service. The bell captain and front door staff were super-smart in both appearance and service \u2013 every need was anticipated with great aplomb. There is also a good sized open-air swimming pool on the second floor with spa facilities and pool-side bar that seemed very popular. No review of the Park Hotel Crystal Club floor would be complete without praising Evelyn, who makes every guest feel special and who makes it her mission to keep everybody happy. She is the perfect hostess and a highly proficient concierge, with masses of ideas for things to do and see in Singapore and environs \u2013 quite simply, Evelyn is the icing on the cake, and a very good cake it is too. I would not hesitate to stay again at the Park Hotel in Clarke Quay.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new zealand", "Title": "\u201ca pleasant place to stay\u201d", "Author": "jackmorrisNewZealand", "ReviewID": "UR117327097", "Content": "this hotel is in a good location and is good value for money .Rooms are small but well equipped .

The hotel is located in an interesting part of Singapore. Its part of an apartment \"jungle\" but also backs onto the Singapore river and many streets that resemble old Singapore but have been thoughtfully refurbished. Its also relatively quiet without a lot of traffic (on weekdays). Its over the road from Roberston Walk which has more bars, restaurants and cafe's than you can count. They are all very stylish but also very relaxed and include a range of local, Asian and Western food. Also over the road is a modern but small Mall that has a couple of sandwich places, Starbucks and a well stocked supermarket and pharmacy. But there isnt any shopping to speak of, outside of the Liang Court which is a casual 10 minute stroll away. This is a nice shopping centre which has a number of local cafes and stalls, but there isnt a lot inside. The hotel is a about a 15/20 minute hot and sticky walk from the MRT, so taxi's are required to get around. But for those who know Singapore also know that taxi's are cheap, clean and plentiful (when its not raining that is). I stayed in deluxe room which had a modern decore, still looked new and was very well presented. But the room was small even for just one person. It also had many frustrations like no draws for clothes, very limited hanging space, no iron/ironing board, very small work space and not even a small table for room service food. Like most Singapore hotels there was also no top sheet. Just a dooner which in this climate is just plain silly. Breakfast in the restaurant was OK, but with no real service on offer. It's designed to get you in and out quickly with everything basically being self service. But still adequate. So for me, I think this is an interesting choice for the tourist who doesnt want to be in the centre of Singapore action, but wants to be a 5/10 minute taxi ride away. It will also suit a tourist who wants lots of eating/drinking options in typical Singapore outdoor style, but is happy not to have shopping at the front door. But for the Business traveller I think this hotel lacks many of the basic facilities that makes the difference between a good stay and a frustrating stay.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, great service\u201d", "Author": "Aassddffgg", "ReviewID": "UR117064225", "Content": "We could not have been happier with the Park Hotel.

If you just go on visit only to the 57 floor it will cost you S$20 anyway to see the view , say you are going up for drink/meal and its complimentary.

Hotel looks very elegant and clean and rooms were comfortable. A few things that were disappointing were, my room (726) did not have a universal adapter in it, whereas a colleague of mine was staying in room 820 and it did have one. When I went to the reception to ask for one, first I was told I would find it in my room when I returned in the evening - that did not happen. It took 2 more conversations and an escalation to the Sales Manager to find out they did not have one and the hotel did not offer to go out and buy one (probably a $5-$10 investment) so that is my only bad note for my visit. Overall the service was great, breakfast was OK and the concierge was always very helpful. Bellhops were also very helpful too. Proximity to Clarke Quay was nice as we had many restaurant choices there. If I were to return to Singapore, I would probably look to stay elsewhere only because I would like to be able to compare, but if I had to stay in this same hotel, I am sure I would enjoy it too. One thing that did strike me as odd was that in my 2 weeks there, I think I saw different staff serving breakfast every day except for 1 or 2 (out of about 5). Not sure why, but being there so long, this did not really allow for any familiarity to build between me and the staff.

While checking in I inquired about breakfast and was curtly told by the same creep that 'your reservation doesn't come with breakfast. If you want breakfast you can buy it in there' as he pointed to the coffee shop which also doubled as a restaurant. I took breakfast in the mall across the street.

On the outward journey we had a standard room and were disappointed with the overall quality. A double bed was positioned tightly into a corner of the room , requiring one person to clamber over the bed to get out in the morning or during the night and the bathroom door catch did not secure properly with the door sliding open all the time . Loosening the catch solved the problem which could permanently be remedied by planting an additional plate on top of the existing one. Seems the catch position in the glass door was wrongly constructed at the build stage. Additionally, a broken lamp was held together with a plastic strap which seemed very poor for a hotel of this quality. On our return journey we had a De Luxe room which was a much better proposition with views over the river and pool. Slightly larger than the standard room it proved to be adequate with space each side of the bed this time, but ....the bathroom door catch did not operate again. The absence of a lounge in the hotel , other than a few seats in the reception area, can be annoying as there is nowhere to sit and relax. Also, if you have a delayed flight and need to spend an hour or two waiting around there are only a few seats available. This is a busy hotel and the reception area can often be crowded with guests checking in and out. Having said that the hotel is well located for access to the river and there are numerous restaurants and Singapore's bustling waterside within reasonable walking distance. Breakfast was very good with a choice of typically English ingredients supplemented with some alternative local cuisine.

Located in Clarke Quay, it is easy walking distance to many new restaurants and shopping venues. The staff was friendly and welcoming. I was fortunate enough to have booked a room on the upper two floors (Club Level). This allowed me access to the 10th floor lounge for morning breakfast and evening cocktails / hors d'oeuvres. The only negative during my stay was the first morning when I tried using the lobby restaurant for breakfast (included in room rate). The atmosphere and clientele were complete chaos. After waiting to be seated by the hostess, I had to be reseated three different times because everytime I got up to get something from the buffet, another \"guest\" took my seat. It was extremely crowded and the staff tried to help keep my table, but I guess that the social norms of other patrons is different than I am used to. After that experience, I used the Club Lounge on the 10th floor and was able to have a leisurely and civil breakfast (also included in room rate). The evening happy hours were also very relaxing and welcome at the end of the day. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore, especially on business.

Also a part of our package was daily laundry service - that was a bonus. The rooms and bathrooms were tiny (no bathtub!) and the bed was uncomfortable. I didn't spend a lot of time in my room - but this was NOT the definition of luxury...and certainly not the luxury price I was paying. There was no electrical outlet in the bathroom so I had to dry my hair with a non-ergonomic hair dryer out at the desk with an extremely short cord. There is no iron/board in the room, so you have to call down for one. There is only broadband internet, so you also have to plug your computer in to connect to the internet. The closet is also tiny and my 15\" laptop would not fit into the room safe. We even had club access but it still didn't make up for some of the shortcomings. All in all, it was not a totally bad experience. I will admit that I am in fact completely biased because last year I had such a fabulous stay at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore.

Near 2 MRT Stations. We were collected from the airport by luxury car, arranged with the hotel. When we arrived after 2pm (normal check-in time), we waited for our room, Our hotel voucher confirmed that we had booked a Superior River facing room with King bed, however when we arrived the hotel only had Superior City facing room available and all the River Facing rooms which were available had two single beds, something you definately dont want on honeymoon. So we opted for the City View to have a King Size bed. Reception informed us that a River Facing King room would be available the following day if we so wished to room swap. This was disappointing since we had pre-booked the room in advance with our specifications requested and not fulfilled as we expected started our experience off to a poor start. We were escorted by Patrick the doorman, friendly staff member and worth recognition. Our Room key flashed red several times, coming from the hotel industry this either means that the key had not been programmed correctly or the key lock would have malfunctioned, the poor doorman had to go back and forth to reception to change the key, after a few minutes of frustration and two employees attending to the problem later the key had finally worked and the green light appearred, hooraaahh. Walking down a little corridor and an immediate glass sliding door *entrance to the small bathroom* we found our double bed (not king as requested) which over-looked the city, grey office buildings and roofs to municipal city buildings was a definate change from a view on a tropical island which was our first leg of our honeymoon. The room was small and cramped, Was this in fact a Superior King Room which we had requested? At this point we headed off to experience the nightlife of Singapore and decided to deal with Reception in the morning and swop rooms. The following morning we headed out for breakfast and requested that our luggage be transfered to the next room. When we arrived back from our bustling day shopping in Singapore, we collected our keys and entered a bigger and brighter room now this was more like it. Our room had a beautiful view of the pool and Riverside Shopping Complex. Much better and closer to that which we had requested in the first place. The room is comfortable, good quality beds and linens, quality amenities. Mini-bar is a bit steep, worth considering when there are 24 hour 7 eleven stores at Clark Quay, Would recommend that a blind be installed to hide-off the lavatory thus making it more convenient when more than one occupies the room. We missed our first wake-up call when requested from a lady at Reception the night before. Thus missing a tour we had scheduled that morning causing us to rearrange our planned activities. After bringing this matter to the attention of Reception, followed after were personalised wake-up calls and delivery of daily newspaper. This added a nice touch to the rest of our stay. We would highly recommend the Room service, good food quality and prompt service. Good selection of evening meals available. The pool area was well maintained, pool bar was under renovations, would have been nice to experience that. The day before our departure we were let down by a hotel tour group, over-took the entire lobby area making it difficult for other guests to access lifts and breakfast area, groups should be allocated a seperate dining venue not to scare off couples and business travellers when wanted to have a quiet breakfast area. We had checked out at an awkward time 2am in the morning to be exact, we had arranged with the hotel to store our luggage and shop until our transfer collected us from the airport, we planned to arrive at the airport at 22h30, originally our transfer was requested for 22h30 so we liaised with front desk to shift our transfer to 22h00 30 minutes earlier, the gentleman at Reception somehow confused 10 & 8 o'clock and booked the transfer for 8pm. We arrived back from Orchard Road at 10pm road to a dissapointed taxi driver and an overcharge to our hotel account for delaying the driver, even despite our efforts to mention that we had booked it for 10 and not 8 reception refused to waiver the fee. We paid it later on and because we had already been late thought we would lay all our complaints and compliments when getting back home. Has potential to be an all rounded hotel with enough rooms to accommodate all kinds of travellers from leisure to corporates to groups, operations needs to be fine tuned here but achievable. Great location again and will recommend the hotel on this merit despite certain unfortunate experiences at the Park Hotel.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cHad a Wonderful Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "Kiwidreamer", "ReviewID": "UR68033131", "Content": "As a stopover option, this hotel suited us just fine.

We were delighted with this and it really sealed for us how good this hotel was. The pool was a godsend as it was very hot and muggy there in May - note there is a spa pool tucked away in a corner of the pool area that we didn't discover until our last day. Our room was rather different with a glass wall separating the bed and bathroom - yes you could watch your beloved on the toilet or in the shower if you so desired. A novelty feature that we were able to live with for 2 nights but not sure how a week of it would have gone down. It did make the room feel more spacious and had a great view over the pool to make up for it. The room we were given for the shower did not have a glass wall so clearly you could request one of these if you wanted to. Highly recommend the Japanese BBQ restaurant across the road where you cook your own meat on an individual BBQ at your table - delicious. Many other dining options in the area at both Robertson Quay just behind the hotel and Clarke Quay just across the bridge from the hotel.

Like China Town that does not get going until the evening. The food from the stalls in Food Street are cheap and if you find the small shopping centre at one end do go upstairs into the food hall which the locals use. Again great food and cheap. Thought we would go to Raffles for lunch got dressed up but when we arrived people were walking round in shorts and flip flops. I guess you would be allowed in some of the restaurants dressed like that. We decide to go to the long bar where you can sit and eat peanuts throwing the shells on the floor. We had a Coke and a Beer which cost around 30 Singapore Dollars ouch. The pool was really lovely and is the same depth in all parts. Plenty of towels and comfortable beds.

The check-in process was smooth and quick. Rooms fresh and clean, not enormous but not what I would call small either.

The hotel was quiet, good housekeeping and toiletries, elevators fast and good cold air-conditioning which is essential in Singapore. We had a flat-screen TV and plenty of power outlets to charge our phones, camera etc. We didn't eat in the hotel because we were basically just sleeping there (our main aim was to be out and about seeing the sights as much as possible) but the restaurant on the ground floor had a very modern fit-out. Didn't use the gym but it had very modern machines. We swam in the pool on a few occasions and the atmosphere around the pool was relaxed and the service for drinks around the pool very prompt. Our favourite part of our room was the shower head which was an enormous \"rain shower\" head that was fantastic after an 8 hour flight to Singapore.

However, looks can be deceiving. The main lobby reeked of perfume/cologne. I thought it was a passing thing (some people like to wear excessive smelly stuff), however, it seems they (hotel) continued to pump this rank and awful odor through the lobby to either mask the smell of its guest or they (hotel) thought it might be a pleasing scent to its clientele. Anyone allergic to perfumes should stay away from this hotel. My sister and I checked into the room which I think was on the 7th floor. It was small. There was no place to put your luggage (except on the floor against the windows) and I was not happy. There were two single beds which pretty much took up the entire room. Clean room, but oh so small. Claustrophobia comes to mind. We then upgraded to a suite on the 10th floor for a surcharge of a 188SGD plus the relevant room service charge of 10% and GST of 7%. The suites were decent with two attached rooms. One queen bed (may have been king) in one room, pull out bed in the other room. However, there was no alarm clock in either of the rooms nor were there electrical outlets in either of the bathrooms. I could not believe it. Basic amenities missing. I had to hook up my electrical razor and hair dryer in my room, not in the bathroom the way it should be. There was no gift shop and the restaurant/bar were small and located right next to the main lobby, with the rank odor of the cologne/perfume permeating the area. The ladies on the 10th floor taking care of the clientele staying in the suites were exceptionally helpful and afternoon \"happy hour\" and breakfast were pleasant. The hotel is in an ideal location but a headache for cab drivers and other transportation. Taxi drvers must pull in, turn around and face the way they come in. There is no through thoroughfare. In summation, the regular rooms are extremely small and the foul smell in the lobby was a total turnoff to me. I would never consider staying at this this hotel again and nor could I recommend this place. I found it to be an odd hotel with a strange layout and I am positive that there are many other hotels in the area that are probably a much better value and provide a more \"guest\" friendly experience.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cWould not recommend this hotel\u201d", "Author": "leeson28", "ReviewID": "UR66843457", "Content": "Have stayed in Singapore many times and this is possibly the worst hotel we have ever stayed in, we booked a room on the club floors, normally these rooms are a bit better than the rest, this is not so, the room was nasty, small, badly furnished, the bathroom you could hardly move in and the bedding looked dirty.

WE did not have a bed and breakfast option but we found a really nice cafe (Venus Cafe) in the mall opposite the hotel where they serve really fresh local dishes for breakfast and lunch (their nasi lemak is great for lunch and breakfast of gaya toast and fried Bee Hoon (noodles) is delicious!) The owners, Venus and her family are really friendly and we alawys look forward to our meals there.

Go for a swim at 9pm and you will probaly have the pool to yourselves. This is where the positives end. Even with all the good features, we would not return to this hotel for the price we paid. The reason is simple. Rooms are very tiny and as a couple, we could hardly find room to store our luggage. In fact, my wife felt so claustrophobic one night that she had to get out of the room for a walk. For the price we paid (Cdn $140 per night -we stayed 10 nights), we probably could find a much better hotel in the city. The room had no Iron or even an alarm clock.

Beds were super comfy, TV has all the right channels for international guests (CNN, NHK, CTV, etc.). The room service was prompt when I called to have the connecting doors unlocked. The hotel location is second to none, 5 min casual walk to Clark Quay. In fact that was the original reason that I booked this hotel in the first place. The logic being that there must be some New Year celebrations and parties around Clarke Quay that night, and that we do not need to worry about transportation back to the hotel after the celebration. In general, both hardware products and software services, in my opinion, were very competent. I am sure there are other areas that can improve, but I did get a sense the staff is putting extra efforts to make guests' stay an enjoyable one.

There is, however, a shuttle bus service to Suntec City Mall, but of which is operated by Suntec, and not from the hotel.

The location of the hotel is good without being great - it is a bit of a walk to the nearest station and the centre of Clarke Quay is still about a 10 to 15 minute walk. In saying this it was not a great problem and it was certainly the best hotel in its price range this close to Clarke Quay.

One thing that probably stood out during our stay was the service. We were initially upgraded to a deluxe on a higher floor. Due to our request to be able to see the river, we were given a pleasant and relaxing pool view - our thanks to Xin Yuan for her help in this. While hotel staff were generally friendly, the breakfast staff appeared to be the only ones that wore frowns on their faces, perhaps due to the high volume of traffic. Location-wise, there's no question that the hotel is ideally placed to Clarke Quay and the Singapore River. It's just minutes from Orchard Road by cab. Nuff said. Regarding the amenities, the hotel is really new. The lobby is cozy flanked with 2 internet terminals at the corner and the restaurant on the other side. The lifts are spanking new and I overheard some guests marvel at its interior. The swimming pool was like the hotel's centrepiece, with a jacuzzi on one side and huge stone slabs on the other for people to cross. One minus is there's no sauna or shower facilities on the pool level. Also, it seems the hotel didn't really put much thought into the parking spaces. There was space for about 25 cars with some lots taken by the restaurants filling some lots with their trays/dishes. Strangely enough, guests can't even enter directly into the lobby. It didn't really give a first good impression but thank goodness the rest of hotel experience made up for this. Room-wise, it was rather small but equipped with the necessary fridge, coffee/tea, LCD TV, desk and table. Having visited a few other hotels of equal or admittedly better calibre in Singapore, I'm surprised that quite a few things are amiss. 1. Bathtub - no explanation needed. 2. Good placement of TV ports - you could only plug to the TV itself. Other hotels provide a dedicated panel of display and audio jacks that is conveniently placed for users to plug in. This is all the more surprising considering it is one of the newest hotels in Singapore. 3. Complimentary water - I would think this is a default. Apparently not. To be fair, it was a nice cozy room with a good view and we spent lots of time looking out and enjoying the relaxing view. And yes, the room amenities are very new. Value-wise, the package for locals is great in that it provides tickets for a River Taxi return trip to One Fullerton, an extended checkout time of 3pm, breakfast and complimentary internet.
