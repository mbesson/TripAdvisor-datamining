My fiance came across the courtyard and it was rather inexpensive in comparison to the other hotels in the area so we went with it. After getting up at 4am to catch our flight to Miami and then driving for 4 hours to Key West we were absolutely exhausted and were in serious need of some sleep. That's when we learned how loud the hotel was. The walls are quite literally paper thin. Kids running up and down the hallway laughing & screaming sounded like a herd of elephants. Guests staying next door to us having a causal conversation sounded as if they were in the room with us. At one point I heard a male's voice ask a question - I assumed it was my Fiance and answered him... turned out to be the guy next door! The bathroom was very small and counter space was something to be desired. An individual on the heavier side may think the bathroom is uncomfortably small. The shower head is set very low so anyone over 5'6 has to bend back in order to wet their hair. My Fiance, with back issues, had an interesting time showering during our stay. The Internet took quite a while to get working. My Fiance is in IT so he eventually figured it out - the average Joe probably would not have gotten the internet to work. The breakfast bar was nice. They serve Starbucks! You get to choose once meal from their menu and it's complementary with your meal ticket they give you at check-in. The food lacks flavor, but with all the fabulous restaurants around with extensive menus we found ourselves eating breakfast at the hotel only once. The pool was really nice & they have a tiki bar for those wanting to drink while sunbathing. The hotel also has a small \"beach\" which seems great for little kids - doesn't get deep. Staff here was fabulous - super friendly! The hotel shuttle runs every 30 minutes to Duval Street and we took full advantage of this amenity during our stay. The shuttle stops picking guests up on Duval Street at 10:30 which was a little early for us bar hoppers, so we ended up with a Taxi. Taxis from the hotel - to Mallory Square/ Duval Street will cost you $20.00. Not bad, but it adds up fast. For those contemplating whether or not to use a rental car throughout the stay I highly advise against it. Parking down by Duval Street is very rare and very expensive! Rental bikes, mopeds and rental golf-carts are the way to go for those unable to walk very far. One more thing - they have a Pizza Hut literally right across the street that closes at 1am. Being able to get pizza hut after a day of drinking was fabulous!", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loma, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "tray0106", "ReviewID": "UR119972855", "Content": "The rooms are very pleasant and comfortable.

We expected the town to be all party and not adaptive to a family style vacation but found otherwise much to our satisfaction. Duval Street is certainly a party capital but there is plenty for families to do. We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Waterfront. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the waterfront fool you. Yes it is on the waterfront (bay side of the Keys) but there is not much to do at this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153waterfront.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is mostly mangrove and turtle grass which, while essential to the ecosystem, is not good for sunbathing and swimming. Of course this is typical in the Keys. The benefits of staying at this location are that it is handy to the shopping centers across the street with a K Mart, Albertsons Groceries and many restaurants. There is an hourly shuttle to Old Town. You could walk to old town but it is quite a hike. It is quieter at this end of the island in comparison to staying in Old Town. The hotel is not up to the usual Courtyard standards (we stay at Courtyards frequently) and from what I understand is a conversion from another brand. The pool is adequate. The room was serviceable. We were on the ground floor of a two story hotel so had easy access to the pool through the sliding door. We asked for a refrigerator early in the week and were promised one as soon as one became available but it never showed up. We were going to stay at the Key West Marriott but they only had king beds and that would not have worked for our party of three. An alternative to the Courtyard may be the Fairfield Inn a couple of blocks away. I viewed the hotel from the outside and it looked good. You usually get a free breakfast at Fairfields. There is no shuttle to Old Town. We would consider staying here again. It is not a resort experience (not too many places are in Key West) but still provided sufficient comforts for our five days on the island. Key West is a charming town. Be sure to visit Mallory Square at sundown for all types of eclectic entertainment. You have to have you photo taken at the Southernmost Point in the U.S. if only to say that you been there and done that. It is a short walk from southern end of Duval Street. I had an interesting tour of Ernest Hemmingway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s House. We beached at Fort Zachary State Park. There is an admission fee and some interesting snorkeling off shore. Be sure to bring water shoes since it is a rocky beach. The highlight was a manatee that surprised us in about eight feet of water. It caused quite a commotion on shore much to the consternation of my wife. I highly recommend the Yankee Freedom ferry trip to the Dry Tortugas National Park. The crew was great. The Dry Tortugas are truly a gem at sea and the snorkeling exceptional. The trip is expensive at $160 a person, but a must see experience. We use Jan and Michael\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stern book, 500 Things to Eat Before It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Too Late as our gastro-entertainment guide when traveling. It has not guided us to indigestion yet. So we ate at Louie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Backyard. The location is postcard perfect on the ocean side of the Key. The food is expensive ($150 for three, food only) but exceptional. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss Blue Heaven Pancakes for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The pancakes are heavenly. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid to ask for Key Lime Pie for breakfast dessert. The meringue crowns out at 4 inches and is like eating clouds. Prices are reasonable (between $40 - $60 for three). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the roosters distract you. We ended up there three times and the taste buds never tired. A&B Lobster House was excellent. It is expensive but the service is impeccable and food well worth the price. The Half Shell Raw Bar was great. Too bad they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep the pigeons out of the eating area. Kermit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Key West Key Lime Shoppe was nifty. The frozen Key Lime Pie on a stick was a tourist magnet but quite tasty. Parking is very limited in Old Town. Duval Street is an impossible drive in the evening. There is a public garage on the corner of Grinnell and Caroline. We parked there for the all day ferry trip. It is four blocks from Duval Street.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alpharetta, GA USA", "Title": "\u201cLush tropical landscape, georgous property!\u201d", "Author": "jonk73", "ReviewID": "UR118567831", "Content": "We stayed here for a weekend getaway and were really surprised to find a truly beautiful landscape, on the inlet water, great staff and clean rooms.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cWill definitely stay here again\u201d", "Author": "chiquicyp", "ReviewID": "UR117911067", "Content": "We did not have reservations since it was a was a last minute getaway but were pleasently surprised for this hotel to have an available room on Labor Day weekend.

Yes...the bites were confirmed to be bed bugs (linear bites). More hellacious than mosquito bites by far! They became pustular and infected that same day.

I found this place to be comfortable and relaxing. The front desk staff were extremely accomodating and made sure that I had a room the minute I checked in at 12pm, where I am rather used to waiting around till 2 or 3 for my room in other hotels. The room was comfortable and had all that I needed in amenities, it was clean and I saw no evidence of bugs that other reviewers have mentioned. The restaurant is good for a hotel breakfast is served inside, lunch is served at the Tiki bar, however they do not serve dinner there so you are pretty much guaranteed a trip to the old town every night to grab dinner. The pool is heated and quite comfortable and the hot tub is actually hot unlike other places. The pool has a Tiki bar located as part of the grounds and it is a great little hangout point for conversation with both guests, the bar staff and locals as that is a favorite watering hole for them as well. The beach out back is pleasant to lay on and sun yourself and they have lots of chairs available for that. Yes the water looks a bit like a pond but I asked about that and they had a VERY good excuse as to why. It is an aquatic nursery back there. Walking along the boardwalk back there I was able to see a baby nurse shark, juvenile barracuda as well as blue and horseshoe crabs. So if you are into or not adverse to a bit of nature around you this is deifnately a place to stay. Even around the pool you can occasionally see an iguana or the small lizards that are common in Florida. Was even able to pick some small bananas from the trees around the pool, and they were edible. The shuttle to the old town is a small shuttle bus and probably seats about 10 to 12. Never had to cram myself in when we used it as we had a rental car for our day trips and used the shuttle for the evening trips when we knew we would be out drinking. It runs every half hour so was very convenient, however it does stop running around 11pm, so if you want a late night out you will cab it home and that costs about $13. My only complaint was that they cranked up the a/c one day during my stay and I came back to a rather frigid room after a day on the beaches.

I asked if they had given my room to another person since my room didn't have a fridge as requested so they called one room close to mine to ask the people if there was an extra bag; totally unprofessional. Did they really think that someone who got an extra bag and didn't return it during the entire day was going to do it now? I was getting very upset and told them to call the people that had worked in the morning and track back what they had done to the bag. They just didn't know what to do or didn't care about solving my problem. As far as they were concerned: lost bag; that's it. Leave us alone.
