By then they had organised the room change and even changed our luggage to the new room! Decent size swimming pool. The highlight has to be the massive breakfast feats! The breakfast is endless and you can sit there eating the variety all day. Not to say its a bit on the higher side (\u00a314.00 per person) but remember to sign up for MAS point card (group hotel points system) so you get the breakfast for half price and also internet for free. Otherwise there is a charge for internet (\u00a320.00 per day). The Canjillas metro station is only 5 minutes walk and you get tickets to GranVia (Madrid central) for 1.50 Euro each way.

The room was a good size with air conditioning. It was facing the busy street so although widows can be opened it's quite noisy. The bathroom has a hair dryer, magnifying mirror, plenty of hot water at any time of day, and nice samples of l'Oreal toiletries. It was all very clean. The bed had an excellent mattress, not too soft at all. The tv had an adequate range of BBC and CNN channels. On the day of check-out they kindly extended our time from 12 to 3pm which was very convenient. I would rate the hotel a real 4 star - possibly at the lower end but higher than 3 stars. The breakfast is truly exceptional - both the presentation and the taste of everything on offer is wonderful. A range of juices, breads, cheeses, meats and croissants, thick creamy yogurt, delicious cakes. And when we went in Aug 2010 this buffet only cost 8\u20ac per person! Really well worth it. The pool is not huge but adequate (with a life guard on duty as well) with free towels and nice sun loungers. I enjoyed topping up my tan there alternating with refreshing dips into the pool. I would recommend this hotel as we had a very relaxing and comfortable stay there but it's far from the city centre and the travelling back and forth can wear you down. The nearest underground station (called Cannillejas) is less than 5 min on foot from the hotel though and the line (no 5) goes straight into the heart of town (stop called Callao) in about 25 min. The trains are frequent and very clean. They felt very safe to me. Each journey cost 1\u20ac and there are deals for a booklet of 10 tickets and 1 or 2 day tickets. Trains run until 1.30am. In the immediate vicinity there's nothing much to look at and only a few facilities like cafes. There was only one real restaurant we found and one small supermarket to buy bottles of water etc. Cannillejas is very well served by buses as well as the underground - if you're coming from the airport you can take the bus 204 from terminal 4 or the 200 (which seemed very frequent) and the 101 (less frequent) from terminals 1, 2 or 3. All these buses go to Cannillejas in about 10min (in this case, much quicker than taking the underground). It only cost 1\u20ac and your day ticket for zone A will take you back there on your return as well. Calle de Alcala is an extremely long road by the way, which goes right into the heart of the city centre.

Nevertheless, the room was very clean, the bed very cosy and comfortable, bathroom impecable. Breakfast with a wide variety of food. Nice pool - we went there every day, from 12h to 17h, as it was so hot (40\u00ba) it was impossible to visit Madrid. Fantastic. In spite of not being central, we got to the centre in approximately 20 minutes by metro. The station (Canillejas) is in a 3 minutes walking distance from the hotel and it runs till 2 a.m. I think it's a great value for money, not a 4-star hotel and not central, but I enjoyed so much that next time I'll be there again. The thing I most appreciated was the friendliness of the staff. They were great, always available to help, very attentive.

We were expecting a 4-star hotel, but what we got instead was a rip off. The hotel is indeed newly renovated, albeit in a location that is far from ideal. It is relatively close to the airport, but there's no decent restaurant either in the hotel itself, or in the immediate environs. Thus, we arrived tired and exhausted at 9:30 p.m., expecting to eat in the hotel restaurant and get to bed. After getting very bad advice from the sole receptionist on duty (who was engrossed in a private phone conversation), we spent the next two hours walking through some very unattractive streets and then taking a bus to the end of nowhere until we gave up and ate chicken wings at an outdoor beer hall. By then, the bus had stopped running, (no warning at all from our dear hotel receptionist whom we tried to consult for advice) and we couldn't even hail a taxi. All this with an 11-year-old in tow! Hot, exhausted and very angry, we returned to the hotel at close to midnight, having walked the whole way back. The only refreshments available at the hotel were from a sole vending machine in the small lobby, although the room had a small refrigerator -- with nothing in it. There's supposed to be a tiny corner bar in the lobby, but it was not staffed and seemed there only for show. The breakfast the next morning was quite good, but by then, we were ready to leave this hotel and never, ever return. Oh, and there's supposed to be a shuttle bus for this 4-star hotel. Turns out it'll pick you up (a half hour after you call) from the airport. But getting back to the airport is another matter. The shuttle runs only for two hours in the morning, and two in the evening. If you happen to have a flight outside of the exact times their shuttle runs, you're outta luck. Overall, this hotel is not to be recommended for either service or location. And the room we stayed in was little more than a cubicle with two twin beds that three people had to share.
