The biggest munus of this hotel is its location. You have spend about an hour to get to city centre (when we were there several underground station were closed and we spent 1.5 hours) The room was ok, but we had some problem with a shower - we couldn`t get warm water, only cold or boiling. And the breakfest was awful. We had to wait for 10-15 in the line and then get only one cup of tee ond 2 biscuites.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cBasic, far, expensive\u201d", "Author": "Eltga", "ReviewID": "UR26286136", "Content": "The hotel is more run-down then a highway motel but the rooms are clean and staff was moderately helpful - aside of the fact that you could barely find one that speaks English. Rooms were clean but that's where the good stuff ends. Room is decent in size however no carpeting, only tiles on the floors, kind of uncomfortable to walk on if you didn't bring slippers -- which they do not provide - , a very hard mattress ( double room means twin beds put together) lousy pillows. The walls look like they've been painted with a broom, the light fixtures have been recently changed i assume however they forgot a wire that was just dangling from the ceiling near to the other light fixture. The location, it's on the outskirts of Rome, minutes walk to the Subway and 14 subway stations to Termini. Did not look like a very safe place to return to at night. Overall, i would not recommend this place to anyone for more than a night's stay if you cannot find anything else. Now the person that chose this hotel for our group got a piece of our minds when we got there and we learned too look up reviews before going somewhere.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cSinking lower as our USD$ falls...\u201d", "Author": "dysphorichousewife", "ReviewID": "UR17626238", "Content": "Buyer Beware! Our tour coordinator for a soccer trip (4 Tors Sports Tours) booked us into this hotel. Clearly it doesn't take much to earn a 3-star rating in Italy. There are only three positive points I can make about this hotel: the cappucino in the coffe bar next door is good; the bathroom in my room was ok (but one of my fellow travelers had only drops of water coming from the shower); the subway station is a short, scary walk away. The negative points are legion so I'll just give you a few: one of our tour members had to take a cab to this hotel and had a hard time finding a driver that would take him there; the carpets in the common areas are filthy and stained; the mattresses on the single beds are ancient (I would guess that they date from the 50's). If I had been by myself instead of with a large group, I would not have felt safe here at all and would have moved to a different hotel immediately.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "norfolk", "Title": "\u201ctake with pinch of salt\u201d", "Author": "waggyNorfolk", "ReviewID": "UR10728088", "Content": "If iou'e going to Hotel Cinecitta don't be put off by the reviews- they are OTT. Yes , the hotel is run down and a little tired and struggles to live up to its three stars, but it does not approach the levels stated in the reviews. It is fairly clean, basic but comfortable, the atmosphere is friendly and the staff are helpful. The Metro station is only five minute's walk away, and although the area is not attractive, neither is it intimidating.

This hotel ruined my trip, b/c I basically went without sleep for 5 days. Of course, a place like Rome gives new meeting to a city that does not sleep, but after 12-hour days in the city, scouring museums, churches and other tourist destinations, the last thing you want to find is a shower that is so small that you can't bend over ( I showed alone) and the obnoxious hotel management does not even turn on AC until the month of July. I was there in May of 2005, and it was increadibly HOT. The coffee tastes like @$$, the beds are too old, the mattresses were also from hell. If you have back problems, stay away from here. Heck, if you have an ounce of common sense, stay away.", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStay Away At All Costs!\u201d", "Author": "silksheen", "ReviewID": "UR6917653", "Content": "Stay well clear of this dreadful hole!
