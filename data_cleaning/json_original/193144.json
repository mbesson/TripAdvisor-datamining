The hotel is situated very close to the Gloucester Road tube station which offers service on the District, Circle, and Piccadilly lines, enabling you to get to the majority of the top sites in the city. For the location, it was reasonably priced. However, we had some difficulty finding the hotel, as the directions provided on the website are somewhat misleading - the website says the hotel is located across from the Sainsbury's supermarket when it is in fact a good bit further down the road. Our room was decent with a clean bathroom, small television, and complimentary shampoos and lotions; however, it appeared that one of the bottles of lotion had previously been opened which was somewhat displeasing. The maid service was somewhat slacking, as our bed was never really made but rather the sheets were thrown up to the pillows. Our room was also located right across the hall from the elevator which was extremely noisy throughout the night. The breakfast that came with the room was good, but be sure to check if your room comes with a continental breakfast or a full English breakfast - the food on the table isn't very clearly defined as to which foods are included in each breakfast. The majority of the staff in the dining area were very pleasant, with the exception of the red-haired woman who \"greets\" you upon entering. She was quite rude and made us feel unwelcome. The staff at the front desk was helpful as they held our bags for the afternoon after we checked out; however, they all seemed extremely disinterested in their jobs. They did provide us with forks and plates one night when we wished to eat in our room. Additionally, our room reservation came with \"30% off bar drinks,\" but there was no working bar to be found in the hotel.

We arrived just after 7pm, having booked this hotel as a way to break up Eurostar travel and then onward train journey home, the reception was unmanned, there was no bell to draw attention. After a few minutes a young man came from what I now know to be the bar / breakfast room, and gave us the key to our room. When we got there the first thing I did was draw the curtains, to block out traffic noise as we were on front of hotel and obscure the view in from the hospital over the road. At first I laughed thinking i'd overpulled the curtains, then it became obvious they were too small for the window, about a 6 inch gap. Having since read the reviews of other people on here, I know this is not uncommon. I went to reception and asked about this, if this could be resolved as the noise from traffic was loud and no way would I sleep. The man stated the room we were in was a \"very nice room\" and the ONLY other free room was a compact room. He gave me the key so I could have a look and yes it only just fit in a queen sized bed, but it was on back of hotel, yes the curtains didn't fit the window but not so overlooked. So compact it was. The next drama was when we wanted to go out to get a meal, we left the room only to find the door wouldn't lock properly, we hadn't been offered a key to the safe, so going out seemed like an improbability. We got it shut and locked in the end, but it seemed flimsy and nipped to sainsburys and back, didn't dare venture further. I tried to contact Easyjet who I'd booked with but couldn't get through, I desperately wanted to be reallocated elsewhere. The shower had a leak on the pipe and the toilet didn't flush first attempt, but we had a bed. And with the chain on the door we about managed a few hours kip. At breakfast I noticed the list that the woman who asked our room number showed more free rooms that just the grotty one we'd been put in, so I almost spoke to the suited man at reception who appeared to be a manager, but figured the best we'd be offered was an upgrade to the full english, or at worst case a complimentary stay, and I certainly wouldn't go back there.

First, the plus points. The location is within seven or eight minutes walk of either Gloucester Road or Earl's Court tube stations. You can be at any Central London location within 20 minutes of leaving the hotel. There is a good selection of restaurants between the hotel and Gloucester Road Station. We had certain grievances with this hotel. When we first entered the room we noticed one of the curtains was coming off its rail. It was impossible to close the curtain in the evening and during the night it fell down and woke us up. We brought this to the attention of the reception the following morning and were told it would be sorted out. When we returned early in the evening we saw that it had been taken away but not replaced. We reminded reception that we were without the curtain and again were told \"No problem blah blah blah\". Needless to say nothing was done for the rest of our stay. Who knows whether or not the curtain has yet been replaced. This window was on ground level looking onto the garden and thus was a major issue. We did not sleep well because of uncomfortable mattresses as we could feel the springs. The corridor outside our room appeared to be the routine home for black binbags possibly full of laundry although we did not examine the contents. On arrival we had to move two of them to get past with the suitcases. The price included a full English breakfast which consisted of sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, mushrooms, baked beans, tomatoes and hash brown triangles. This might sound delicious but it was not cooked to order but sat in heated containers as part of the buffet table.

On the first night roadworks took place directly outside the hotel and because the hotel does not have secondary or double glazing the noise was horrendous and none of us got any sleep. But even worse the mattress on the beds was the worst we have ever experienced. Very lumpy and it felt as if the springs were coming through the material. We reported this to the receptionist the next day who did report it to housekeeping. The chambermaid put a cover over the mattress making them more comfortable for that night's sleep. So we were pleased with that - they acted promptly. Breakfast was the worst we have ever experienced. The continental breakfast consisted of cereal, some meat, toast or croissants. No yoghurt or eggs. An extra charge was made for a cooked breakfast. Not impressed at all. We will not stay there again.

I booked directly with the hotel and informed them that we would arrive in the evening for check-in. I was quite surprised when we arrived to the hotel to check-in, because they immediately informed us that we were not staying at the Derby Hotel, but instead they had reserved us not 1, but 2 rooms across the street at the Quality Crowne Kensington Hotel, a 4-star property where they apparently have a relationship. I wasn't sure if this change of plans and the surprise of being switched to another hotel was a good surprise or not, as I have had quite a few previous experiences with hotels at 3 and 4 star levels in London and in London the star rating doesn't really mean as much as it should, unless you book 5-star then of course the hotel is sure to deliver what it should. Continuing, we crossed the street and proceeded to check in at the Quality Crowne. I was disappointed that our rooms were not connecting rooms, as with 2 young children in a large city, I would have preferred to have had direct access to my kids from my room. Instead we had to exit our rooms and travel between them via the corridor to see one another. The rooms were clean, except for one day, there was a dirty-stained comforter cover placed on my daughter's bed and a stained pillow case on my son's pillow, but Prashant at the front desk was very courteous and had both changed promptly while we were out for dinner. One morning we awakened to NO water in the hotel. This delayed our day, as we had to wait for 1 hour for the boilers to be fixed and another hour to have hot shower water, and during most of the break down time, we had no water at all, meaning unable to flush toilets or even brush our teeth. While waiting for the repairs we went ahead to the breakfast room and had a lengthy breakfast, and crossed paths with other hotel guests looking as rugged as us, like they just rolled out of bed, what could we do, so we just tried to make the most of it and eventually at 10 am were able to have showers and start our day. The hotel staff was very courteous during the boiler breakdown and I almost felt sorry for the young girl working the front desk, as she had been insulted by several guests because of the problem. Other than that we had a nice stay, windows are sound proof so one doesn't hear any of the outside traffic noise, as the hotel is located on very busy cromwell street. The Derby hotel across the street though must be incredibly noisy though, as there is apparently no A/C, because we saw guest windows open all of the time, windows that give right onto the busy street. All in all, I am disappointed that I can't give more feedback about the Derby Hotel itself since they switched us to another hotel, but I would recommend that if you book a room at their hotel to ask them to confirm if you'll be staying at the Derby or at the Quality Crowne across the street. As for restaurants, if you continue down cromwell street, about a 10 minute walk, towards Earl's Court, there is a large selection of small boutique style restaurants offering all types of cuisine from Indian to Thai, traditional, French, pub style and at reasonable prices, our personal favorite for the kids was the Gourmet Burger Kitchen.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cDissapointing Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bitian", "ReviewID": "UR17891636", "Content": "I was looking forward to staying at the Derby Hotel based on reviews but was disappointed after staying there for four nights.

Bathroom was clean and mini fridge was a nice bonus. The TV reception was poor, but we weren't there that long to watch much TV. Breakfast was fine, breads, yogurt canned peaches and some deli meats and cheese. We got a rate of 110 pounds for the double and 140 for the family I think, which is a good deal for London given its location and cleanliness. Desk staff helpful and friendly. They let us check in a few hours early which was good. I would stay here again, just remember its a small basic hotel, so don't expect luxury.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "WARSZAWA", "Title": "\u201cWorth money spent\u201d", "Author": "MichaelBr00ks", "ReviewID": "UR14787260", "Content": "Recently me and my friend spent two nights at Derby Hotel Kensington. The experience was not very bad considering it being a small hotel. The staff at the reception desk seemed to be very enthusiastic and were always busy helping guests. The location of the hotel was good, as was at walking distance from Earls Court and one more tube station, which has excellent connections to all the places in London, including Heathrow airport. Most of the important historic attractions of London are in this region and within easy reach of this hotel. We got a very good deal on the room rates, and they had included breakfast in the rates. The breakfast was well prepared and the variety of food catered to all tastes. We ate a large breakfast both days and didn't need to buy lunch, thus saved some pounds, which we used for shopping on High Street Kensington. The room was mid sized, with king bed, and running hot and hot water in the bathroom. The room was cleaned and linen changed every day, without asking, which was not expected from such a small hotel. The only complaint we had was non availability of air conditioning, which helps in maintaining the room temperature in both summer and winter. The heating arrangement was fine, so no complaint on that side. We will definitely use this hotel on our next visit to London and will also recommend to our friends.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lillehammer", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "mariuskavli", "ReviewID": "UR14640837", "Content": "Arrived around noon to check in, and although the check in-time was 2 pm, we were able to get a room thanks to the very nice man behind the counter. The service we got at the hotel was a bit mixed, as the Indian(?) man made us feel very welcome, but not even a smile from the others. Location is perfect as the hotel is situated within a short walk, both to Earl's Court and Gloucester Road station. (300m and 500m). We got the room but was a little bit disappointed as the bathroom was very cold. Asked the other receptionist if they could turn the heat up, as the tiling felt like cold pavement in the morning, but nothing was done. The 230V plug in the bathroom for shavers was also disfunctional. Unfortunately, the water in the shower had to be running for at least 10 minutes before we could even feel any hot water. To get wifi connection in my room, I had to connect to the Premier Inn hotel nearby, as all the other networks didn't work, and is obviously not suitable for business travellers. The hotel had a computer in the lobby with Internet access available at \u00c2\u00a31 per 10 minutes. The hotel didn't charge us when we left our luggage in the back room when needed either. I can easily recommend this hotel to others, as the standard is much better compared to other hotels in the same price range.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Derby Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d193144-Reviews-Derby_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$87 - $238*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">155-157 Cromwell Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW5 0TQ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "193144", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f7/3f/f73f164123cb3cb8f81c09bfb06ffc222large.jpg"}}
