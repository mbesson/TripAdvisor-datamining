In Venice we stayed at this \"hotel\" called \"LUX\" (?!?) why I can't imagine because from the beginning of our arrival we were asked to live the primary building with the sign \"Hotel Lux\" and we were lead to ANOTHER BUILDING on another street, close but with an incredible smell and next door they were working on a building, you can only imagine the noise and the dust. I will let the images speak for it self, because it was a big disappoitment, the furniture is a mess although you can see it was once a beautiful furniture, the bed was made of twin beds put next to each other, although we had payed for a matrimonial room, the walls were dirty, so as a chair in the room, and the bathroom regarding the sanitary elements they were never changed and rusty. On high lows yes the hotel it's a few steps from Piazza San Marco, but it's not always a must, we could have stayed very well in other places too. they changed our towels daily and swept the room, made our bed properly, the breakfast was ok, only due to the nice lady that served us and asked us every morning what kind of coffee we prefer, from hot chocolate, capucino, caffe latte, dark coffee, hot milk. The hotel also has a free trip to the Murano Island each day from 09.30, but you have to announce a day earlier, we found out from somebody else because in our room the announcement was missing. Be careful it is a one way trip to a murano glass factory... called Gino Mazzuccato where if you are not interested in buying they treat you like a nobody, and here I refer to the gentlemen with dark hair, a front calvition and glasses, not a pleasant experience due to him. We choose this hotel because of the location, but... the photos will tell the story.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful\u201d", "Author": "Duncan M", "ReviewID": "UR126354103", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel Lux for three nights as part of an Italian mini-holiday and we weren't disappointed. We had visited Venice before on a day trip and we realised that we wouldn't be staying in a large modern hotel (they don't do that sort of thing here). The hotel Lux is ideally situated for all of the major tourist spots - we were in the annex which is the next alley over from the Bridge of Sighs. The room was compact, slightly dingy and the air conditioning only blew out warm air (it's not too bad in March but could wind up our North American friends in the summer months-especially when the canal odours start to ripen) but hey, it added to the character and even the couple of flights of stairs doesn't matter unless you've brought as much luggage that'll require a team of Sherpas. The staff were friendly and very helpful, and on the last evening provided us with a carry out breakfast for our early flight on to Rome. The breakfast is typically continental - no fry ups here - although the dining salon is small and you have to catch it at the right time to avoid a wait. There are lots of nearby restaurants but we would recommend the Ristorante La Nuova Grotta which is just around the corner - great food and friendly staff- although a little bit pricey. Tell them that you're staying at the hotel Lux and they waive the service charge.

Room was ok and clean, although not gleaming but no bed bugs in our room which means I'm fairly happy. There was an ice sized bathroom but very thin wardrobe, Extra blankets and pillows were provided. We were on the 2nd floor and no window views but to be fair we were out most of the day anyway.

We managed to and took all out toiletries in the travel sizes although sachets of shower gel and shampoo were provided. Breakfast was a bit basic, cereal, fruit juice, tea/coffee and a sad looking but edible croissant but if you're on a tight budget then more than enough to fill up on. No hot food provided. The breakfast room is small and you may have to wait for a table. Breakfast was 8am-10am. At the moment it is very cold so do wrap up warm but this meant that the hotel was very warm and cosy. The downside is that so was our room and we had no control over the temperature which meant it was sometimes a bit too stuffy to sleep well.

The bathroom shower has an interesting door, in that it didn't really function the way they intended, and a bit of water pools on the bathroom floor. Nonetheless, this is minor point. It was clean and relatively quiet, and warm. My problem is with their terrible breakfast. Even for my Italian friend (many Italians don't eat a breakfast in the manner Americans or the British for example) thought the breakfast was terrible. The coffee (Italiano espresso) was wretched, and the croissants were bland and tasted like cardboard. The provide cheap cornflakes and sugary, bad tasting cheap orange juice. I don't expect much for a breakfast, but this was really a low point of the hotel as I think they are being cheap and buying poor quality food and serving to their guests to save money. Do yourself a favor if you stay here, buy food at a pastry shop or one of the markets (the co-op, or billa) and eat it in your room. Note that the restaurants will charge you an arm and leg for \"traditional\" British/Americano/French breakfast. We stayed for 4 days at this hotel and we stopped going to their terrible breakfast and began going to a bar half-block away on calle Rasse-near the intersection of the alley for the hotel. The location of the hotel is OK if you want to be near San Marco, but at night it is really dead. We walked at night to San Croce and other neighborhoods to get out of the epicenter of tourism (San Marco) and find less expensive bars, osteria, trattorias etc. Don't let people tell you that \"nothing\" goes on at night in Venice.

We were in the main building and didn't even know about the \"annex\" building down the street until we were chatting with another couple at breakfast one morning so can't really comment about that, but everyone takes breakfast at the main building Lobby. There is no elevator so you have to take the narrow and fairly steep stairs to whatever floor you get put on. And don't expect help with your luggage either. Our room itself was OK but our bathroom was a bit run-down with rusted shower fittings and you couldn't shut off the bath tap completely when you turned it to the shower. The room was a bit stuffy I think maybe there was an issue with our air-con but I'm not 100% sure. Rather than bother complaining we just spent more time out and about. No coffee / tea making facilities in the room. There is a safe in the room. I found the service a bit on the flat side but was warned to expect this from the more budget hotels in heavily crowded tourist areas. Internet - There is WiFi available but only in the restaurant/Lobby/waiting area, and this will set you back an extra 10 Euros for 24h. Breakfast was basic but enough to survive on. The waitress serving ours seemed to be constantly grumpy, which although I find this amusing, others may not. The issue with breakfast is getting a table. The seating area is tiny and can seat maybe 6 couples more or less. Also beware if you want a coffee or tea outside breakfast hours you will get stung ~4 Euros.

Firstly I had to literally drag one of our 18 Kg bags up 4 very narrow flights of stairs to room 142. No lift. The attendant who was my junior by about 20 years gave no indication that he will attend to both bags. If you do consider this hotel - avoid rooms 140 to 143 - they are located on the 3rd and 4th floors. The very cramped dining room (about 3 X 5 m) was on the 1st floor of a different building across the street. It had 4 or 5 very small tables squashed in and you could not move back your chair without inconveniencing someone else. The breakfast was the poorest of our tour to Paris, Rome, Florence and Venice. Only one type of cereal (corn flakes) and no ham or meat. The toilet in the dining room was blocked by a chair and out of order for the duration of our stay - so back to the room you go for some relief. The aircon in the room just scraped home at full tilt all the time. There is no bath and the shower head was broken and loose from the shower wall fittings. So you had to hold the shower thingy in one hand while showering. I reported this but nothing was done and I eventually tied the head to the fitting with some rope.

To get to hotel from bus station look for the Vaparetto boat berth- it is alongside and below the bus station- The bus station is the Piazzale Roma stop of the Vaparetto. Get tickets from the ticket booth in the bus station square and decide NOW which pass duration you need. The one hour pass will cost 6 Euros to get to the hotel from here. If staying in Venice for 3 or more days you will probably be walked out and need a restful day on the Vaparettos visiting the other islands or just cruising up and down the Grand Canal, so consider getting a longer pass. Visit the web site before leaving UK. (www.actv.it) Take Vaparetto boat number 1 which goes to S Zaccaria where Hotel Lux is located. Disembark at S Zaccharia and stand on the quay and you can see the Hotel Danieli. Your alley is alongside it- Calle D Rasse and Hotel Lux is number 4541/4542. (Whenever catching the Vaparetto, check which direction and route it is covering. We caught Number 82 which also goes to S Zaccaria but ours went around the lagoon edge- more interesting is the Grand Canal route). Note the boats can get hot and crowded unless you get a seat outside at the front. We rode on a gondola from one of the back street canals rather than from the main front and the prices quoted were 50E early on a damp morning and up to 100E when busy on a sunny day. For our 80E (\u00e2\u20ac\u015330- 40 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) we were taken onto the Grand Canal to the Rialto bridge and then had a good tour of the back canals and were on board for 30 minutes in total and got a little bit of commentary. Price is for the boat- not each -which seat up to 6. Top tip. Take your travel kettle, cups, teabags etc Venice is expensive. Tip 2 The touristic menu can be good but you may have to request it. Soup was good, Pasta al Forno (lasagne) was huge and tasty despite being only 1% meat, Liver Venetian Style excellent, Veal escalope good, mixed fish (nibbles) dire and should be left in the freezer (though some other places offered fish fillet), so ask what it consists of.

If you make a reservation with this hotel, make sure it's the one you want, because you are going to get hosed otherwise!", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warwick, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "sazza60", "ReviewID": "UR4468680", "Content": "Very reasonably priced for Venice!

Prices in venice were a fortune so we found this one and took a chance. Hotel had a great location near the water taxis and was easy to find. The staff was friendly and the room was charming. The one caveat is that the hotel has no elevator so bringing baggage up the steps can be difficult but worth the effort. Room was nice and clean and hotel had small area for breakfast. Price was great. My wife was worried when I booked hotel but loved after we got there.", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cReally friendly\u201d", "Author": "weirdpie", "ReviewID": "UR4002348", "Content": "We booked our stay at the Lux on the basis of reviews we had seen on tripadvisor and we're glad that we did. The hotel, although small, was very smart and clean. The location couldnt have been any better - about 3 minutes from Piazza San Marco - close enough to be able to pop back and forth during the day but far enough to avoid the noise of the crowds at night. The room was small but very comfortable and well equipped and breakfast, although simple, was filling. The best thing about the Lux however was the staff. So friendly and always willing to help with a genuine smile. My girlfriend became quite ill during our stay and the staff insisted on accompanying us both to the hospital in the pouring rain, to make sure we didnt get lost and explain things when we arrived. We wouldnt hesitate in recommending The Lux to anyone, and would definately stay there again in future.", "Date": "October 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot great, but very nice\u201d", "Author": "TallyCrew", "ReviewID": "UR3723210", "Content": "The plusses: location, location, location!
