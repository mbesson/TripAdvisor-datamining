Super Hotel\u201d", "Author": "RobOxted", "ReviewID": "UR128472765", "Content": "What a gem of an hotel the Ai Mori d'Oriente proved to be. We used the Alilaguna ferry [Alilaguna supply the best, most detailed map of Venice] from Marco Polo to travel to the Madonna Dell'Orto Vaporetto stop and walked for approx 5 minutes to the Hotel - thanks to the clear directions received. Having registered and been advised about the various tours we could book via Reception, we were surprised to be taken back outside the Hotel and round the corner to a door which led into corridor and stairs to our room located at the far end of the second floor. Entering our delightful room we found ourselves in a 'lobby' off which was a small corridor with built-in wardrobes housing the safe. Beyond the wardrobe was the door into the well appointed bathroom. Large sink with plenty of space for our own toiletries, mirror, square shaped toilet [not to everyone's taste/comfort], shower over bath with glass shower screen [water leaked onto floor through the join]. Returning along the corridor we opened the door to the bedroom and stepped onto the 'landing' with three steps leading down into the room. Directly ahead was a round table with two very comfortable chairs. The huge bed was comprised of two singles locked together - extremely comfortable though maybe too firm for some. Bedside tables with lamps were more than adequate. Opposite the bed was a dressing table which housed the very quiet bar fridge. There was a rubbish bin underneath and then in the second cupboard we found storage space with hairdryer. We were able to use this space to house our own travel kettle, tea/coffee facilities [none supplied by Hotel]. Alongside the dressing table was the usual luggage rack. The design of the windows of the Hotel are in the old Turkish style and the bed head was shaped to reflect this. The room was decorated in a very colourful yet muted pattern on the walls, bedspread and curtain materials. We did not have a view from our window; where would you in Venice? We looked onto the brick wall of the passageway which was well used so a bit noisy however went quiet around 10.00/11.00 pm so not a problem. Later in the year, the windows can't be opened due to mosquitos [we had one or two] however the room was air-conditioned. For breakfast, we needed to walk back into the main Hotel to enter the large breakfast room. The staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive - during our stay we noted the efforts the staff went to to ensure guests' dietary needs were meet. The breakfast is more than adequate: cheeses, meats, cereals, yoghurts, hard boiled eggs, fruit salad, prunes, dried apricots, fresh fruit, various breads/biscuits, cheese cake, orange/grapefruit/apple juice, water, choices of teas and coffees, butter and jams and various croissant/pan au chocolate. We loved the little rubbish bins on each table. Perhaps due to the time of year, we were able to choose our table. There are double doors leading from the breakfast room onto a delightful paved area with chairs/tables/umbrellas. Opposite the Reception is a cosy bar which we didn't have time to use unfortunately. San Marco Square/Doges Palace is a good 20/25 minute walk from the Hotel. The San Marcuolo Vaporetto stop on the Grand Canal is approx 10 minute walk and very useful if returning late at night from the Dorsodura district for example. We bought 3 day pass for use on the Vaporetto which was fantastic value for the 4 days we were in Venice. Fondamente Nova water Vaporetto stop is the next one round from Madonna Dell'Orto: perfect for travel to Murano, Burano, Torcello. Lots of good bars/restaurants throughout Venice; some excellent ones are very close to the Hotel. Perfectly placed [quiet and away from the hectic tourist area], perfectly priced, welcoming and friendly.

We upgraded to a larger room, and it was very spacious, with typical Venetian fabrics and decor. The bathroom was good, with plenty of hot water. You had to be careful in the shower, as there was only a half screen, no curtain, so water tended to spray everywhere. The bed was a large double, made up of 2 singles, and the mattress was fairly firm, which might not suit everyone. Our window looked out on to a brick wall on one side, and the back gardens of surrounding buildings on the other side, but we didn't need a view - you just have to go outside for canals, palaces etc. The breakfast was good, by Venice standards, with fresh fruit, yoghurt, different types of bread and croissants, cold meat, cheese, boiled eggs, pastries etc. We were made to feel very welcome by the staff, who were all very friendly and helpful. They recommended a restaurant, just along the next canal, which was very good, and full of locals. As it was Easter, the hotel reception was decorated with fluffy chicks and an enormous chocolate egg, larges pieces of which appeared in our room when it was dismantled after the holiday weekend. Delicious! The Alilaguna orange ferry from the airport was very quick, about 20 minutes, and drops you off at the first stop, which is only a 5 minute walk to the hotel. This ferry runs every half hour, but you have to allow at least 5 minutes to walk to the jetty from the airport. The nearest water bus stop on the Grand Canal is less than 10 minutes walk, at the Marcuola stop, and quite easy to find, just beyond the Strada Nova, which has many shops and restaurants.

It is furnished beautifully, the staff are incredibly helpful and due to its relatively small size, it wasn't too busy or crowded (except for one moment at breakfast when we were caught in the last minute rush and had to wait a while for a table!). The location is not in the middle of the tourist attractions, it's a fair walk away, but that's exactly why we chose it. It's quiet and you feel as if you're really in Venice, not just a tourist location, and it was loads of fun wandering through streets that weren't packed with other westerners. It's also probably serviced by the closest vaporetto stop to the airport! Our room was really pretty, although quite small - so small that I did feel as if we'd paid a little more than we should have!

This was our last hotel in Italy and had the largest tub. In fact, my DH who is 6'5\" and has wide shoulders pretty much fit in it. There was even a laundry line you could string across the tub if needed. Strangely there was no shower curtain or door so while the hall wall stopped some of the water getting out the bath mat on the far side got soaked. The decor wasn't really my type. Some of said oriental, but that word doesn't quite fit for me. The bed was 2 beds put together, but that is typical of Italian beds - I'm not sure we had just one bed in all of our 2 weeks stay. Some just came apart more than others. Several mentioned the views outside the room and lack thereof. We had a slight view, but it was fairly close to walls. Just remember that few places in Venice will get you much of a view. Breakfast was good. Not our favorite of the trip, but pretty close to it. Didn't really appreciate being told where to sit. Did really like that for our very early morning departure to the airport on our last day they packed breakfast for us - more than we could eat). I would ask ahead of time as I don't know if they do that ahead of time. You have to pay for wifi. They do have one computer that you can use for 1/2 hour free. After that there is a charge. If you use their computer make sure you log out or it keeps using your internet minutes. While the staff seemed helpful I felt more like I was a potential sale. As soon as we arrived we were told of some tours - one of which we could get for free, except for the cost of transportation home - if you know about it. When I tried to make reservations of my own for a tour I had hoped for they suggested another. There is a vaporetto stop about 5 minutes away. St Marks is probably about 25 minutes away. It's hard to tell because we kept getting lost! But that was kind of our plan for Venice. The nice thing for us was several of the restaurants in the area took VISA. We were at the end of the stay and really didn't want to go to the ATM for more Euros and get too many or few for our needs.

This means I can't really comment on value for money as it was all included in the cost of the holiday so I'm not aware of the individual rate for each hotel. We stayed for two nights. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the train station in a fairly quiet area but still close to restaurants and bars. It is walking distance from Ponte Rialto, and we got a water taxi up to St Mark's Square from there. It is possible to walk, but seeing the Grand Canal from the water is worth doing, and although it's about 13 euro for two people it's a lot cheaper than taking a gondola. The hotel room was fairly large and decorated in a typical Venetian style, fairly old fashioned but clean with everything we needed for our stay. The only downside was the bathroom, which absolutely stank, as if there was a problem with the drains. The smell stayed around for the whole time we were there, not sure if it's a problem with all of the rooms and we didn't bother making a point of it, but some people might find it a bit much. The breakfast was good, typical continental with a good range. The staff were friendly enough, and there was a small bar next to the lobby although we didn't use it.

Venice is a beautiful city and I would have liked to have spent a couple more days there. Although there are plenty of specific attractions, it's such an unusual place that just walking through the tiny streets and following the maze of canals is an experience in itself. We were there at Easter, so it was really crowded, but you could still get away from the hordes by going a street or two back from the main touristy bits. There is so much choice in terms of places to eat and drink, and while a lot of them might be tourist traps, we didn't struggle at all to find excellent meals.

Excellent location, in quiet residential area full of character. 20/30 mins walk to St. Marks, 5-10 mins walk from nearest vaporetto stop- Del Orto. Lots of good places to eat nearby, although we were not impressed by the two nearest restaurants on the same street- which seemed overpriced for what they offered. The parallel streets seemed to offer more success- we used the Rough Guide for recommendations. Local off licence sold wonderful draft prosecco at 2.50 Euros a litre! Small hotel bar- I think provided hot & cold snacks- but we did not sample so unable to comment on quality or price. Area recommendations: Explore Cannaregio- check out the local restaurants, walk around the Ghetto. Visit the fish & fruit markets in Rialto. We really enjoyed just strolling round the city to get a feel of the place and it was very atmospheric in February. Getting around: Walk- its a great way to get a feel for Venice & the water buses are ridiculously expensive. Get the bus back to the airport (Marco Polo) which is 3 euros per person (single) as opposed to 13 euros per person via the waterbus. Dining: The Hotel is really well served by fantastic restaurants & eateries just a few minutes away.

A couple of times we did take the number 1 boat bus along the grand canal and the dock is easily reached within 10 mins walk of the hotel.

Yes, Venice was quite expensive because of the exchange rate but as long as you are prepared not to get bargains galore that's fine.

My partner treated me to a wonderful few days in Venice for my birthday and we had a truly romatic leisurely time in Venice.

We found a small bar/restaurant close to the hotel (the next street in front of the hotel) called Timon!! Perfect place for a great glass of wine and cicchetti (a kind of tapas) sat outside watching the world go by, early evening or on the way back to the hotel. The best way to experience Venice is of course either by the bus boat and to walk around as much as you like and \"get lost\" in all that Venice has to offer... walking over lots of narrow streets, tiny bridges and town squares. We had lots of fun in the casinos, bars, restaurants. A totally wonderful experience was to be had at the restaurant at Hotel Cipriani \"Cips Club\" where you call the skipper from the port and he comes over to collect you - lovely guy who we nicknamed \"Captain Birdseye\" haha!!!

Some reviews say that this hotel is too far away 'from the action'. I don't agree. This is a lovely hotel in a quiet part of Venice. If you have stayed in Venice before you will know that the crowds can be claustrophobic. This is a haven of peace away from the maddening crowd. I thoroughly recommend it. The hotel is easy to reach from Piazza Roma. The 'how to find us' directions on the hotel website are accurate - a five minute walk from the San Marcuola vaporetto stop or a 10 minute stroll. Of course, if you know your way round Venice the walk from Piazza Roma or the the train station (three minutes over the bridge) will take no more than twenty minutes. This is a good little hotel with little to fault it. We booked rooms through lastminute,com and got some really good rates. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Nothing seemed too much trouble for them, Breakfast was excellent and lots of choice. The rooms were not large (not sure if they have large rooms in Venice) but they are beautifully furnished and have fridge and tv. The bathrooms were definitely 4 star with plenty of hot water. We had two rooms - one standard and one superior. My friends had the superior room (110) overlooked the small, peaceful canal outside, It was lovely. The other room (room 2) was furnished to the same high standard but was slightly smaller. It's only drawback (and not much of one at that) is that immediately outside the window was the breakfast room - with tables only about 5 feet from the window. It was a bit of a shock on the first morning when, semi naked, I threw back the curtains to see two happy tourists enjoying their breakfast. However, with so much to see in Venice I didn't spend much time in the room so it didn't matter to me. I am sure that if I had asked to change the room the hotel would have been happy to do it. But if this is important to you either go for a superior room or let the hotel you want a room with an outside view. I didn't try the hotel bar but and didn't check the prices because I know from experience that hotel bar prices in Venice are always ridiculous! Instead when we wandered home past midnight we'd stop at the little bar just to the left of the last but one footbridge you cross before reaching the hotel.

Location This is a lovely hotel in a quieter part of town with a community feel to it. The hotel is in the Cannaregio area away from the tourist trap but within easy walk to the Rialto Bridge (10-15mins walk alone Venice's main shopping street) and to San Marco (20-25mins walk alone Venice's main shopping street). There is a lot to see on the walk to these areas so it doesn't feel that long at all! The hotel is surrounded by local Venetians going about their daily business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you will feel that you are a million miles from the tourist traps. The hotel is 5mins away from the main shopping street, where you can find many wonderful cafes, restaurants, mask shops and cake shops. It is also very close to a local supermarket and the local shopping street. Room The room was a good size and clean. Bathroom was also clean and was of a good size. Our room had a small window. Hotel If you stay in rooms 510- 513 (I think) as we did, you will encounter a peculiarity of the hotel layout. To get to these rooms, you must first walk up a flight of stairs (or take the lift to level 1), then go down a flight of stairs then once again walk up a flight of stairs (the last 2 flights have no elevator options). This was not a problem for us but if you are short of mobility this may be a nuisance. However this was the exception to the rule as most of the rooms are located easily from the same level as the lift. The staff at the hotel where very helpful and always willing to be of service. Breakfast Breakfast was the usual buffet continental fare. Good selection of bread with chesses and ham/salamis, croissants, fruit, cereal, yoghurt, juices, Tea, coffee and Hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is a must try \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its rich using dark chocolate! A hot breakfast option is also available. How to get to the hotel Although it is possible to safely walk (via Venice's main shopping street) to the hotel within 10-15mins of the Bus station (Piazzale Roma) or Train Station (Santa Lucia), it may be an idea to take the Vaporetto (water bus) if you have not been to Venice before. Even if you have, like everywhere else in Venice it is a challenge to get to a specific address the 1st time. This is part of the Venice experience! While it is sometimes stressful trying to find your hotel when you are travelling, in Venice you will get lost/disorientated, so just go with it and you will have a better Venice experience. If you arrive in Venice from the Bus station (Piazzale Roma) or Train Station (Santa Lucia), there are 2 options to get to the hotel via ACTV water buses (vaporetto). 1) Take Line 42 or Line 52 to Orto stop from either Piazzale Roma vaportetto stop or Ferrovia vaportetto stop (right in front of the train station), 250 metres from the hotel. Once at the Orto vaporetto stop, keep going straight on calle Larga Piave until you reach Fondamenta della Madonna del Orto. After which, you will keep going to the right, along the Fondamenta della Madonna del Orto, cross the bridge to continue on calle Loredan. At the end of the calle, turn left and you will find the hotel. 2) Alternatively, you can take the vaportetto along the Grand Canal to San Marcuola stop by taking Line 1 or Line 2 from Piazzale Roma or the Train Station. Once at the San Marcuola stop, it is a 15min walk to the hotel. Head to the right of the church and turn left behind the church. Turn right, and keep going straight (passing an intersection with the main shopping street \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at this intersection you should see a small sign to the hotel), until a wooden bridge. Go over the bridge, turn right, then turn left at the first lane (with a blue sign), at the end of the lane walk over the bridge and turn to find the hotel. If you are arriving from Marco Polo Airport, you can take the ACTV vaporetto Line A direct to Orto stop. Follow the directions above from the Orto Stop. Overall this was a great hotel in a great local area with easy access to restaurants, cafes, shops as well as the tourist sights around the Rialto Bridge and San Marco.

The staff are very nice and friendly, and we recieved very nice service. We were in Venice for just two days, at the end of a two week honeymoon, and were looking forward to packing as much sight seeing in as possible. Unfortunately, the hotel was located in the Jewish Ghetto, which is a long walk from just about anything that you'd be interested in seeing. This significantly cut into the time we were able to spend at the big landmarks. The walking didn't end when we got to our hotel, either. Our room was located up a very narrow staircase only accessible through a long winding walk through the hotel and the next door building. While the bellhop managed our bags on check in and check out, I can imagine that the room would be a problem for older guests or people travelling with young children.

Personally we dont feel it is worth the extra euros and the normal bus from the airport was easier and just as quick, runs more frequently.

However, we found the staff to be overall somewhat aloof...nothing concrete to point at, just a general lack of friendliness or warmth, especially considering this had been my third time in four years to this hotel. The only interest the hotel concierge showed to us and our family was to try to sell a tour to Murano for the day.

We found some really nice restaurants within very close walking distance from the hotel, including one of the few in Venice that's open late. The place had a cool scene and live music on at least one night we were there. Another plus about the location is that just a normal vaporetto ride to the hotel is a chance to sail down the canals and see the city.

The hotel truely is fantastic! I've stayed in some small boutique hotels in Paris/London and this has the charm of a boutique hotel whilst being that much bigger (with bar/large breakfast room) to give it a great 'small hotel feel'. From arrival the reception staff were great and the bell boy helped us to our room. I knew exactly what to expect from reading many reviews and seeing other travellers photo's. The deep red furnishings and all marble bathroom really serve to confuse whether you're in Italy or somewhere slightly more eastern and exotic, a real treat for the senses! We had a superior double with breakfast and didn't miss the canal views to be honest. We had a nice view of a courtyard and this was fine. The breakfast was excellent. I had warm bread rolls with hams/cheeses, tomatoe filled warm pastries, croissants with honey and yoghurt every morning! This was included with the room and although you could order omelette's and the like for 3/4 Euro's, we never felt the need to we were so full. Each night we went out we stopped for a few drinks in the bar. Massimo the bar guy was great. Not overly chatty but I don't like much more than a smile, some acknowledgement and good timely service and that's exactly what we got! Had bellini's and some other cocktails and also an AMAZING if not somewhat expensive bottle of chianti one evening. The hotel recommended a VERY exdensive restaurant the first night (La Fondamenta) and I paid ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EURO'S for a three course meal, albeit a very expensive bottle of wine and lots of fish (lobster/squid/sardines etc). We had two much fairer priced meals the next two nights in lovely trattoria's just a five minute walk from the hotel. The walk to St. Marks Square and the basillica took us 45 minutes on our first day, 35 on our secone and 30 on our third! it really is only a 25 minute walk once you're confident of the way and it really is a lovely stroll past Strada Nova, Rialto etc. I could go on about the break in Venice but I'm sure what people want is some good practical knowledge of the hotel and the surrounding area so, in conclusion here are some good tips: 1) Come out of hotel, turn right, take the first bridge on the left and not more than 100yds down on the left is a supermarket tucked away that you'd never guess was there! Good to stock up on drinks/snacks in your room without paying mini bar prices (which weren't themselves bad to be honest) 2) Same right, then same first bridge, but then turn right at the end of the passage and first bridge on the left again! Easier than it sounds! And then you're pretty much in a great small town with restaurants/shops/cash points etc and all just 5 minutes away 3) Harry's bar just off the square for bellini's....where the bellini was invented! Seriously.....a complete must do when in Venice 4) Florian coffee house in the square for the best, most beautiful coffee experience! If not VERY expensive at 18 odd Euro's for two coffee's. this is where the wealthy Austrian's used to drink in the 1900's when Austria owned Venice and you can feel the history......VERY romantic 5)TAKE A GONDOLA.

The view was not the best (the hotel is located in a quieter part of Venice, which is surrounded by flats and houses), but the room more than made up for it. The room also had a small balcony which was perfect for looking at the surroundings. I paid for rose petals to be spread out in our room, and I certainly got my money's worth. The staff had laid rose petals leading from the elevator to our door, and then to the bed (where they had also laid out some chocolates into heart shapes). They had also decorated the on suite with rose petals and candles...and all for 40 Euro's. Guys...this is definitely worth it. The hotel is located roughly 10 minutes walk from one of many markets (you will find many shops with masks and Venetian merchandise, but we found that the shops closest to the hotel were the cheapest). We looked into a trip on a gondola, but for 80 Euro's for 45 minutes it is just not worth it. The quality of the water is not good, and being that close to it will simply ruin the romance. Also, the amount of water traffic is so great that you will simply be thrown around when any boat comes anywhere near the gondola. The restaurants located around the hotel are not bad, but not great either. We went in search for a nice restaurant that did good fish, but were disappointed. The main thing to remember is that any restaurant or shop that has a guy trying to lure you in is sot worth going into. The food may not be too bad, but the prices will certainly be hard to swallow. We had a 2 course meal for 100 Euro's (not the most expensive, but if you tried the food you will have reacted same as me). Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday and both me and my girlfriend are extremely fussy! I would gladly rate this hotel as a 5 star.", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston, tx", "Title": "\u201cService makes up for location\u201d", "Author": "kriptonian7", "ReviewID": "UR13193239", "Content": "We stayed here due to the many helpful reviews that i read here on trip advisor, so i hope this does the same for someone else. We were on our honeymoon and spent 10 nights here. Ill start with the good since there was pleanty of it. :Getting there: Ai Mori d'Oriente Hotel is located close to the jewish ghetto on the backside of Venice on a considerably quiter canal compared to others in the city. From the airport it it very easy to get to after a 5 minute walk to the dock and taking a 20 min Vaporetto across the lagoon getting off at the Madonna dell'Orto stop. From here it is about a 5 minute walk. :First Impressions: The hotel is charming, and you are welcomed by a friendly multilingual staff. Roberto is very nice and always had a good advice, so was Edmundo. We had no problems checking in, they told us to ask for anything we needed, and we were shown to our room by a concierge that toted all our bags. The hall ways smelled of Espresso and croissants for most of the day. Out side there were people jogging, walking their dogs, and just getting on with their day. :Amenities: Our room was nice, and pretty big compared to some Italian hotels. Small table with char, desk, t.v. , and mini-bar. Lots of space for two people. lots of starage space in the room which allowed us to put our clothes up and hide our bags away. bathroom was pretty Italian standard for a rennovated hotel with the large marble sink, the toilette tucked away in the corner. We had a tub that my wife loved, because it allowed many baths at the end of long days. if you take a shower expect to get everything wet. Small safe in the closet of the room as well. The rooms have some attention to detail that make them nice. the trims inthe bathroom, the towel warmers, the decor. They also have a laundry service that picks up at your door. Breakfast was typical cheese, rolls, croissants, boiled eggs, cereal, cappaccinos, Espressos, are all included. They do serve scrambled eggs and a great plate of bacon, a little pricey but worth it when you start getting that \"amercan breakfast\" itch. They will bring anything to the room for 6 euros. We took advantage of this one time for an early morning start. Breakfast rooms are nice and the service is good. There is a quaint bar that serves its purpose with a good wine list and is fully stocked. It is a little pricey but that is expected for any hotel bar so no surprise there. :In the area: The canal in which the hotel is located has nothing other than greats views of the small canal. For us the most important find in the area was the grocery. There is also a Pharmacy close by as well. You are about a 5 minutes from \"la strada nuovo\" which is a main street that can take you to Rialto (15 min), San Marco (20 min), Vaporetto stop San marcuola (7min), & Train station (7 min). There is shopping, many places to eat , and bancomats everywhere. Things are close, but if you want more action, id suggest staying somewhere closer to the grand canal or close to the City's center. This area is not very touristy, and has more of a neighborhood feel to it TIP >>out the front of the hotel go right, first bridge go left, about 20ft down the alley-way on the left is a grocery. Cheap sodas, water, snacks, meat, and basic toilletry items.>> :Critiques: We stayed in room 307. it was the last room at the end of a hallway next to what i would assume is a service door. We like to sleep late, and a ew nights actually went to bed before 9:00pm. Between the hours of id say 8:00am and 10:00pm there is some one coming in and out of that door every 5 minutes. outside our window is somesort of delivery area or just a back door to the hotel and we got alot of noise coming in and out of that as well. We are hard sleepers, but i can see how this could be a problem for some others. So be wary if this room. im sure they would have moved us if we would have asked. Bed was two twins pushed together (standard again for italy) and a little stiff. Pillows were nice, and the cleaning crew was quick and and they did their job well. Hotel is a little far. The restaurant that was suggested by the front desk was nice. It was a little pricey for what we got. i think our meal came out to be 180.00 american (appetiser, soda, water, meat, bottle of wine) the appetiser alone that was suggested by te owner was 36 euros. It had marinated shrimp and sea bass uncooked. Just a heads up, but i did have the best bottle of wine our entire trip there. It was about 3 mintues from the hotel. they like to suggest it alot. :Wrap Up: I did like the hotel, again the service was excellent. They called a taxi for me at no charge for a very very early flight. If we needed something they were quick to give it and surprisingly they did not charge for their extra little services. Location is great for the relaxing wanderers that we are. It allows you to se a part of Venice that most tourists will never see. That quiet every-day life Venice away from the masses where people help little old women up and over bridges and where neighbors gather and have a glass of wine laugh. Id definatley stay here again for a few days. maybe not for another extended stay. I would reccomend this hotel for older travelers that like the peace and quiet. Younger crowd should probably move closer to the action, but then again you will pay more for it.

We were extremely pleased! Given the location, condition of the hotel, the staff, and the included breakfast, you can't beat the price. Location: A little off the beaten path on the Sensa Canal. A plus is that It's easy to get to from the Madonna Del Orto (Orto) water bus stop (10 minutes walk). You can be on the Rio Terra \"street\" in 10 minutes on which there are lots of Restaurants, shops, and several groceries. This street connects with the Strada Nova (more shops and restaurants) and eventually the San Marco/Rialto zone, these are about 30 minutes walk from the hotel. The Marcuola water bus stop is the closest Grand Canal stop to the hotel, 15 minute walk. *Having a map of the city and the water bus routes is essential. Hotel: A four star hotel, In Venice, for about $100 per night! what a great deal. The rooms and hotel were nicely decorated in a Moorish motif, hence the name and history of the building. NIce sized room and great bath (by European standards). Given the price paid, we were concerned we may be in the basement, but were not (1st floor room 104). There were some rooms involving several halls and flights of stairs. Anyone who has mobility issues should know enough to ask ahead of time. Breakfast: The breakfast included in the hotel rate was substantial, simple, and good. (meats, cheeses, breads, cereals, yogurts, juices, sweets). It was the same everyday, those who are not happy with the selection can order a la carte off a menu for a price. The Staff: Prior to arrival, I emailed the hotel to confirm the booking, they promptly responded with a cheerful confirmation. (The hotel was booked on Expedia which had a slightly cheaper rate than the hotel website). Check in was easy and the staff more than helpful in holding our luggage until the room was available later in the day. The front desk staff and dining room staff were always cheerful and informative. Other helpful points: >Getting to Hotel-The hotel website advises taking the Alilaguna Blue line (via Calonna, Murano) to The Fondamenta Nuove (Nuove) stop and transferring to the Vaporetto boat then to the Orto stop. However, if your flight arrives/departs 10am-5pm aprrox., you can take the Alilaguna Orange (Arancia) line directly to/from the Orto stop (via Calonna, Murano) and skip the boat transfer at Nuove . The orange line times of operation are more limited, so check out the Alilaguna Website for your specific flight time needs. Using the orange line saves time and the hassle of moving yourself and luggage from boat to boat. Getting around-If you have lots of luggage or mobility issues, this hotel is one of the easier to get to from a boat stop, but paying for the expensive water taxi should be considered. Keep in mind, not all hotels are on a canal and water taxi accessible. The vaporetto water bus lines are extensive and easy to use, but walking is inevitable in Venice. Venice is a truly unique and enthralling city, this hotel is a wonderful part of that experience.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach, FL", "Title": "\u201cRomance is in the Air\u201d", "Author": "BOO-CM", "ReviewID": "UR12862748", "Content": "This hotel was abosolutely a great find and our favorite of the three hotels we stayed at during our trip to Italy.

The room was equiped with a mini bar/snacks which was a pleasant surprise since our arrivals at the hotels always seemed to be late at night. The bathroom was nice as well. The hotel faces one of Venice's many canals and is in a private residential area. We enjoyed walking to and from the hotel each day to the main St Marks area where most of the action is. The walk takes approximatley 15-20 minutes. We arrived in Venice at midnight via the train station. It was raining a little and the night was foggy but cool looking. So we opted for a private boat ride which would not have been necessary if it were not raining.

As our room was at the annex and the top, we had slidy roof which is quite unique. I loved the bathroom although for my 6 ft 1 boyfriend, the shower head reaches his neck rather than his head.

We had the option to sit outside the made up conservatory which is heated. There is also an option for breakfast to be delivered to room for an additional price. The bed was comfortable and there's a turn down service as well. The place is probably a bit of a track away but we manage to walk to St Mark's Square in 20 mins or so. We liked the fact that you can take the water bus from airport and stop at Madonna del Orto which is 3-5 mins walk to the hotel and going back as well. You can also head to Murano Island from here. The \"innercity\" water bus stop is also 5 mins away. But generally we enjoyed walking into town and back (much needed exercise following our food consumption!)

I always imagined that when I came to Venice that I would be able to fling the windows open in the morning to a beautiful sunny day and look out over the canals, alas it was not to be and we opened our window to a brick wall on the ground floor! I suppose that is the price you have to pay when you go for a cheaper hotel and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upgrade to an executive room! Anyway, you can't have everything, it was a very pretty room and quite ornate, but very small and dark. So no chance of relaxing here and watching the world go by! On the plus side it was very clean and the sheets were good, towels a bit thin and small for me! The room number was 303. There was a small room for breakfast. A lot of people have said the breakfast was great, I thought it was OK. I can pretty much remember exactly what they had, 3 types of ham, 2 types of cheese, 3 different croissants, some cereal, boiled egg, yoghurt, juices and tea and coffee. What I did like was the small courtyard that you could sit outside and have breakfast though. Bear in mind that you are not allowed to sit outside BEFORE 9.A.M.! so if you are an early riser you will miss out on this treat which is a shame (as we did twice). The waitress was very nice and the reception staff extremely helpful and friendly, so if you need any advice ask them. Venice is a beautiful city and I think if I went back I would probably stay in a different hotel across the other side of the river (purely to save my poor feet!) as there are some lovely quiet canals not that far from St Marks but I would still definitely recommend this hotel (and may be go back to this hotel if we got another good deal) if you are visiting Venice as we managed to get the hotel from an internet site that had 3 nights for one offer plus flight (driveline.co.uk) and there really was nothing I could complain about at all.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aylesbury", "Title": "\u201cLoved it all.\u201d", "Author": "ringside", "ReviewID": "UR10025299", "Content": "it was everything we could have asked for.

We had several heavy pieces of luggage and were looking forward to some assistance with them, but instead we were given curt instructions as to how to find our room, which was located at the top of a 3 story staircase at the end of a maze of hallways and several doorways. What kind of 4-star hotel sends its guests up 3 flights of stairs with their baggage and offers no assistance. The room was quite small and disappointing as well, although the bathroom seemed to have been done over recently and was satisfactory. We enquired about switching rooms to one that was located in a more accessible part of the hotel, and were told to try back in the morning. In the morning, we were told to try back in the afternoon. In the afternoon, we were told we could have a different room for an additional 100 euros per night. The next night, we returned to the hotel after an evening stroll and the front door was locked. It took a few minutes of knocking and ringing the doorbell until the front desk employee came out of the back room and unlocked the door. Strangely, he didn't bother to open the door for us - he just unlocked it and then scurried back behind the desk. The next evening, we required some assistance in our room, and we were told to try back in the morning because the only person working in the hotel said he couldn't leave the front desk to help us. From the reviews below, it seems that there are hotel rooms in the basement of the hotel with no real windows, and there are various wings that have been added on to the hotel so they can make an extra buck. In all likelihood, the rooms in the main part of the hotel are probably nicers and more spacious, but good luck getting them. I would think they shouldn't be charging the same rates for subterranean rooms or rooms in the attic of the back stairwell, but the front desk employee insisted there's no difference between any of their rooms. The ownership/management of this hotel appear to be masters of capitalism, but have no idea of what it means to service their clientele. They've managed to extend their hotel and add rooms in every possible direction at the expense of the service that hotel guests should be receiving. How many more subterranean rooms or rear wings will they add on before hiring some additional help, so that there might be service available other than a the front desk? How many more floors can they add on without providing their guest with an elevator or a bellhop?

Clean, nice location, smart.\u201d", "Author": "Keir", "ReviewID": "UR7584054", "Content": "My girlfriend and I just got back from seven nights at the Ai Mori d'Oriente Hotel. Here's the run down: GENERAL The hotel is tucked away on a canal in the quiet district of Cannaregio on the northwest of the island, a refreshingly (and apparently quite unique) residential corner of the main island. From the outside the hotel looks lovely and has some tables by the water which are good for a quiet night cap before bed after a day's walking exploring. Once inside the place is very nicely decorated, if a little dark (not much day-light finds its way in to the hotel by all accounts). The reception is all marble floors and wood panelling. It's spotlessly clean. The staff are equally well presented in extremely smart uniforms and they obligingly help you with your bags. They were all efficient enough but the real star was the night porter; a short grey haired fellow called Rafael who was a really friendly and charming. LOCATION It's a twenty minute walk to St. Mark's and the claustrophobic throngs of tourists. St. Mark's is so crowded staying there would be like sleeping on the London underground for a weekend and unless you want to purchase a knock off D&G bag at 11pm, the surprisingly native district of Cannaregio is ideal and really relaxing - as long as the weather is good. We had two days of heavy rain and the walk back from the Vaporetti stop seemed a lot longer with wet jeans so be warned. The nearest water bus stop is five minutes away, the next on the Grand Canale is a pleasant seven minute stroll down a touristy street. There is a supermarket just across the canal too. The rail way station is about a ten minute walk. In terms of dining it's in an ideal spot because our experience tells us you'll get the best food around here in the small restaurants frequented by the locals. The parallel canal over the bridge has some really lovely bars which are full of amiable locals. If it's late and you want to chill by the water on a quiet night I implore you to check out a tiny wine bar called Timon: [--] the range of wine is extensive and cheap, and the staff are lovely. We also enjoyed live jazz in another bar on this stretch, it's worth a look. ROOM Our room (a superior double on the second floor) was spacious. The decor reflected Venetian architecture. It was decorated in deep reds and yellows which were a bit much for me, but the furniture was of high quality and there were some nice touches like the Venetian style arch way and the marble bathroom. The bathroom was indeed nice and spacious, more importantly for me the shower was consistently hot and with a turn of the shower head also very powerful. The TV had a multitude of channels, the English speaking ones being BBC (which wasn't working but I didn't bother complaining - because I'm English), CNBC and CNN along with one film channel on which they showed a variety of relatively recent DVDs. The two main bedroom windows opened out onto a brick wall which was about three feet away, but hey, welcome to Venice - not a deal breaker anyway. BREAKFAST The breakfast was nice enough. Essentially the hotel is a posh B&B so you get a continental start to the day including (not always fresh) croissants, apple pastries, ham, oranges, juices and tea or coffee. You can get these delivered to your room for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6 or if you've got a hangover, go down and get the tea/coffee on a tray and bring it back so you can have breakfast in bed without the charge. STAFF The staff were friendly enough. The barman seems to have taken a bit of stick in previous reviews on here, but if it's the same one I met he's a nice eccentric fellow how will give you great service. The staff on the desk were OK. As I said earlier, Rafael the night porter was great. I booked a smoking room which we subsequently didn't get (thankfully in hindsight) so I popped out for late night cigarettes and Rafael was so obliging and charming he really made the stay. If you see him say hello from 'Edmond' and Jessica! :) OTHER THINGS THAT MAYBE USEFUL + Stand on the right and get out the way of the locals as if you were on the tube. + All Venetians have pet dogs. + I found the Lonely Planet guide book superior to the Rough Guide, but beware: if you're looking for a nice place to eat and you pick a restaurant from these books you'll be surrounded by English people that have done exactly the same thing - find a nice place off the beaten track that isn't in the book. + Watch for the swimming rats. + When they put the little stickers on the windows warning you not to open them in the summer season for fear of mosquitoes they were also referring to early May! + Go up the Campanile tower in Piazza San Marco at around 6.15, the massive bells will ring above your head. It's very loud but it serves for a great memory. + I'm not one to evade fairs, but no one ever checks your ticket on the Vaporetti so you may think twice about purchasing the really expensive ticket suggested by the guide books. + Book through Expedia, it's cheaper than the hotel site.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cLong Weekend in Venice\u201d", "Author": "ElleGolightly", "ReviewID": "UR7389445", "Content": "Just back from a 4 night stay at the Ai Mori d'Oriente Hotel.

If you want to get away from the crowded streets around San Marco this is a great place to stay as the area is not touristy and the hotel is on one of the smaller canals lined with houses. Walking really is the best way to see the city as the water taxis are expensive - we got a 3 day water bus pass at 30 Euros each and just hopped on and off the buses when walking became too much. Get on a No 1 at the railway station early in the morning and get a tour down the Grand Canal and round to Saint Mark's Square at a fraction of the cost of a taxi/gondola.

And it's very handy for the vaporetto service (water bus) at San Marcuola so don't believe any of the nonsense about having to get water taxis everywhere.

However, beyond looks this place is a nightmare. The location is horrible as it is located on the far side of the island so you can only get to and from you room via water taxi, which can run you up to $100 per trip. It is in an area that is mainly deserted, albeit some signs of other humans. The staff is an absolute nightmare. We found them to be arrogant, rude and will nickel and dime you for every penny they can get. Because they are located so far from all the activity many of their visitors end up here by accident or for price as they are one of the cheapest 4-star hotels on the island. Don't be fooled by the nice looks. While their rates seems fair you loose the savings by having to pay for water taxis. Unless you are leaving big tips for everyone service is extremely poor. It was hard to get directions, assistance or anything else unless you are willing to pay. I wish I would have followed my instinct when I first arrived as we needed to make a phone call before checking in and was charged the equivalent of $32 US dollars to call an 800 number. From thereon is was all uphill as we paid for any and everything including extra sets of towels. The worse character of them all was the hotel manager. This guy should have been a snake oil salesman. When asked for ice one day he told us \"where do you think you are this is not San Francisco, it cost money to make ice\".

To leave the thronging crowds and minutes later to be walking along the quiet canals of Cannareggio was perfect.

I felt rather too keenly that we were yet another couple on honeymoon here - OK they can't make a fuss over everyone but the masks had slipped rather too much even this early on in the season (June).

I had stayed at this hotel before for a week during Carnival and had a great experience with it (I have previously submitted a review on this site). When our travel agent offered us the choice of pre-cruise hotels (this one 4* or a 3* hotel) we immediately chose this one on previous experience. I must say I was disappointed. We did arrive late but that was due to the timing of the flight and the fact that the buses and vaparettos were on strike. We arrived approx 11.15 pm or so. We were shown to a door (after a journey through I think two buildings) with no number on it even though we were told it was room 500. When we went in the first thing we saw were a pair of boots on the floor beside a coffee table and a plastic bag with some items in it. The coffee table was in front of a sofa. To the left of the sofa there appeared to be a bathroom/shower of some sort (did not investigate). There was also a flight of stairs within this room which led to a door (presumably another room) at the top of the stairs. There was a wooden decorative screen dividing this sofa, table and bathroom from a door on the right - the one we were shown to. This was our bedroom. It was one of the tiniest I had ever seen. I asked where the window was and was shown a skylight over the pillow area of the bed. (about 15/20 ft up) even though the rest of the ceiling was normal height. What would we have done in the event of fire? We could only open our cases by putting them on the bed. We tried to change the room to be told that it was the only one left and the hotel was full and they would move us the following day if we so wished. We did wish and we were moved. I must say I felt most uncomfortable sleeping in this room the first night. We left the skylight open for air but had to close it when it started raining during the night. I kept wondering who owned the boots outside the door, if maybe staff used the room to sleep on the sofa whilst on a break. When we mentioned this we were just given a shrug. Anyhow the boots and plastic bag were still there next morning. After breakfast we went back to the room to pack up to go to the other room. On our way out we noticed the boots were gone and voices were coming from the open bathroom asking us to \"come back later, we are taking a shower and are not yet finished.\" The voices were from an American couple who were showering together and who presumably were the owners of the plastic bag and boots. We could only gather or surmise that they were from the room at the top of the stairs. All I can say is it was the weirdest set up I have seen. We had booked this hotel months previously through our travel agent and I must say I did not like room 500. Everything else about the hotel was up to expectations including their wonderful breakfast.

There was cheese, 3 kinds of sliced meat and rolls, cereal, yogurt, juice and coffee service. We appreciated the hard boiled eggs since they are not always available at hotels that include breakfast. The location of the hotel was toward the back of Canneregio near the Adriatic side. This could be convenient if you use the Aliguna boat from the airport.

We were happy with the location because it was close enough to what we wanted to see, but just enough away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The location was lovely - in the Canareggio region to the noth of the island. It really only took 5 mins to the 2 closest vaporetto stops (Madonna del'Orto if you're heading towards Murano and San Marcuolo for heading down the Grand Canal towards St Marks). As we arrived late on our first day we decided to get a water taxi which cost us 60euros from the airport as we shared with another couple. It really was well worth it - a quick and luxsurious way to transfer to your hotel. It does take a little way to get your bearings adn find your way down the alleys. Having said that, we didn't get lost at all. We used the water buses absolutely loads - buy a tourist pass (1,3 or 7 day) - we paid 25 euros for 3 days. I only have one or 2 very small whinges about the hotel. When we arrived at 11pm we were shown to a room by a porter in jeans and trainers (the rest of the time everyone was immaculately dressed), out room was number 621 which was up quite a lot of winding stairs with no lift ( i think it was on the 2nd or third floor!). We also paid for a superior room - whilst our room was beautifully decorated it was overlooked by the apartments about 3 feet accross the alleyway (no canal view), it had no sofa or table as advertised. We did question this but were told unfortunately nothing could be done as they were fully booked. A few lovely touches though like little easter eggs left for us by the bed each night, turn down service and a note about the following days weather. Ate at a couple of plces recommeded on here too - Antico Mola - lovley, home cooked food but very slow service and pretty chep (50 euros for 3 courses for 2).

We stayed at the Ai Mori d'Oriente Hotel while in Venice on March 4th and 5th. When we first got to the hotel, our room wasn't available because there was an issue with the power. They transferred us to another hotel which was initially disappointing (it was a nice enough hotel, but not as nice as Ai Mori d'Oriente). The next morning they brought us back to the Ai Mori d'Oriente Hotel and gave us the best suite in the hotel! It was a wonderful room and they also provided us with wine and a fruit basket. We hadn't complained at all about being transfered to the other hotel, so when they surprised us with the suite and wine, we felt they had far exceeded our customer service expectations in dealing with the issue. The staff was the friendliest that we encountered in Italy, especially Marco the manager. They had an excellent breakfast. It was a little out of the way of the main area, but that ended up being okay as we got some extra exercise in walking to and from.

Didn't really know what to expect but were happy with what we found. Our room was pretty tiny, fitting a double bed, small desk, and a closet, but most people don't go to Venice to lounge in their room. What was most important was that it was very clean. The bathroom was narrow, and the shower was really small (since only half of the shower is covered by a glass \"door,\" you have to put in a little effort to not get water all over the bathroom floor); however, it was modern and very clean. The breakfast was pleasant - there's a decent selection (cereal, croissants, fruit salad, yogurt, pound cake, etc.) We flew in, took the bus (I think it's #5? Just ask someone at the airport which bus to take to get to Piazzale Roma) from Mestre to the bus station (Piazzale Roma) - this took around 30 minutes. The bus ride costs 2 euro per person. We paid the bus driver, who gave us tickets, which we didn't validate on the bus at the time since we didn't know (if you don't stamp it, you can technically use it again) - however, it was strange because we noticed that every single person just got on the bus without paying or validating their ticket - we assumed that 1) they were taking their chances since it's not really regulated OR 2) they had bus passes. From Piazzale Roma, it's supposedly a 12 minute walk to the hotel - however, we didn't have a good map on us, and got totally lost - it turns out we ended up making a circle (yes, we walked east to the Rialto Bridge then back up again). We ended up buying a detailed map which didn't seem to help all that much, and all in all, it took about 2 hours to get to the hotel. HOWEVER, it really isn't that difficult to get there! It's literally a 10 minute walk or so. I suggest that you first ask directions to go to the Santa Lucia train station - from there it's a piece of cake. You pretty much walk down the main road (if you were facing the train station), go down the main road that right on the right of the train station and parallel to the canal...then it's best to ask for directions from there. We laughed at how short of a distance it really was. The hotel's location is great - it's a nice and quiet residential neighborhood. There's a supermarket called Billa nearby, if you want to pick up some water or snacks. Also, if you want to go to Murano, the hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the dock. Ask the hotel for directions (quite easy since their are vaporetto signs) and take #42. The hotel is about a 20-30 minute walk to Piazzo San Marco, depending on how fast you are! Oh and one last piece of advice, if you are taking any overnight train from Venice to Rome, or any other destination that's quite long...make sure to get a reserved seat! Our cabin filled up quickly, and some people had to stand or sit outside. The other thing is that if you have the extra money, upgrade yourself to a bed or something more comfortable than a regular seat! In 2nd class at least, there are 6 seats per cabin - it's set up so that you are facing and sharing leg room with someone directly in front of you, so it gets really uncomfy on long rides!", "Date": "March 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troy, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel and Staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4690219", "Content": "This hotel was elegant!

We booked this Hotel on the basis of the very positive Trip Advisor reviews, liking what we had read about the Ai Mori, its staff and location. Its a beautiful Hotel in a quiet area and with helpful staff. Its also a bit quirky. As the hotel has expanded into the two adjoining buildings, it can be a bit of a trek to get to the rooms. Labrynthine is the word that springs to mind The Hotel was pretty full when we stayed and we were only able to book standard rooms. They were nice, but not as nice as the rooms pictured on Trip Advisor. Our particular room (513) was very warm - unbearably so on occasion and we had to switch off the central heating. The air conditioning is not available at this time of the year, so that was not a solution. We had to open the velux window all day and all night to keep the temperature down. One solution would be to switch off the fridge - but it does prove handy to store your own drinks and provisions. The cost of the mini bar items was high, as were the bar prices. There was some room noise, but it was not unbearable. It did not prevent sleep. I think it just depends who happens to be occupying next door at any particular time. The bathroom was beautiful. Really attractive marble tiles. The breakfast was adequate. I have certainly had better, but there should be something for evryone on offer and if not eggs, bacon etc are available at a 3 to 6 Euro supplement. We found that if we got down to breakfast by 8:30 am we got a table easily, after that, be prepared to queue/wait. Couple of other points worth making. One website indicated that the Hotel provided bathrobes and slippers. They may do, but not for us or any of our other 4 travellers. Also, the pillows are high and hard. As I have arthritis problems I asked at Reception for a slim and soft pillow and one appeared as if by magic - and they put it on my side of the bed!(How did they know?) People with disabilities certainly need to point out that they need to be either on the ground floor or have access to the (small) lift. Not all rooms do. All the Reception staff were very helpful. They even lined up to say goodbye to us at the end of our stay. As there were 6 of us we travelled to and from the Hotel by water taxi. It cost 90 Euros each way, so worked out well for our party. We also hired a Gondola at Rialto which cost 60 Euros. My advice is to haggle. You will find that you do get reductions. Its then a question of whether you feel that you have managed to achieve value for money. If pushed we could probably have down better. The hotel is within 20 mins of St Marks Square and its an easy find. We walked most of the time and did not get lost once. Besides, almost every building has a sign signalling the direction to the major sights. The Vaparetto is good value too. However, we used it only a few times over two days. In the main we were disappointed with the restaurants we chose. Watch out for those which demand a cover charge 2 -3 Euros per person, plus a 12% service charge on top. We had some nice meals, but not consistently so. The welcome at Diana (see earlier reviews) was warm and genuine. 5 of us had excellent meals, but the sixth member of the party had a fillet steak that was off. The owner was very apologetic. However, I would not let that put you off. It was by far the best Restaurant we visited. In others we were served sole, which tasted more like a shoe than a fish! Again in another Trattitoria dei Peochi, we had \"fillet\" steak which was not a fillet at all. (Welsh Black Beef it most certainly was not. Our conclusion overall was that the Venetians do pasta and pizza well, but that for meat the standard was a bit hit or miss. We may just have chosen badly, but none of the restaurants we chose were cheap. Most of the recommeded Restuarants in the travel guides were booked up so if you want to get into some like \"Le Bistrot de Venice\", book before you go. There are a number of good snack bars, wine shops and mini markets very near the hotel. Use them, they were all good quality and good value. We throughly enjoyed our trip to Venice and would go back to the Ai Mori. However, we would insist on a superior room, probably in the main part of the Hotel. It would be worth you checking the details of the room you could expect in advance, as they are not all of a uniform size. Some are very small. Others very acceptable indeed.

Our room was not apart of the main hotel (#413), but we did not find this to be a problem. We were in a building next to it that was joined by a plastic hallway (sounds bad, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) Although, we did not have a view from our room we loved it, as it was big, clean and quiet. There were no surprises and it was exactly what we expected (we had read reviews and looked at the website). The bathroom was amazing as it is brand new and spotless. We walked from Piazzle Roma in less than 15 mins. There is no need to get the vaporetto (waterbus), unless you have a lot of luggage. The only problems I can think of (which are minor) was that there was no conditioner included in the toiletries and when we first arrived our beds were pushed together, but made as two separate twins, but the staff quickly rectified this. The breakfast is between 7:00 am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10:30 am. They are delicious freshly baked croissants, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, yogurt, the regular assortment of meats and cheese and even p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9! I was delighted to discover the fruit salad, which was made of fresh fruit and not that cheap fruit cocktail. The location is perfect and I loved that it was tucked away from the busy crowds. Even though it was low season, the streets still seemed to be packed. Nothing was too far away and we walked everywhere. There is a little grocery store around the corner, where we bought bottled water (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.35 or 6 for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.00), juice (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.18 pack of three) and cookies/snacks (a lot cheaper than the mini bar). When you leave the hotel lobby, turn right and go over the first bridge on the your left. This leads onto Calle del Forno. The store is on the left hand side. We also discovered the perfect little restaurant about 3 mins walk away, which made our stay all the better. Since the food, service and location were perfect, we ended up going there every night once we discovered it. (There are so many things to try on the menu, which is in English too! I was weary at first because the lonely planet guidebook deters restaurants with menus that have English, but this was not a problem.) After a long day of sight seeing we would head back to the hotel to relax for an hour or two then head out for dinner. The restaurant is called the Ristorante Diana (Address: Fondamenta della Misericordia 2519, Cannaregio (turn left outside of the hotel, take first bridge on the right and turn left once you have crossed. It's a few buildings down). It just opened and was only a week old when we dined there. The food is to die for and they do not charge a service or cover charge (we left a huge tip as the food and service was flawless) like all the other restaurants do. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is quaint. My boyfriend loved the complementary shots with the waiter at the end of our meals. Must try the gnocchi with cheese and a pasta dish with seafood and brandy (Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best Italian dish I have ever tasted!) Beware of sandwich shops by the train station. They look packed with meat, but when we went to eat them all the meat was pushed to one side so more then half of the sandwich didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything in it! I was horrified as it was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.70 for a lot of hard ciabatta bread, two small slices of purshuto and a bit of green. This hotel is wonderful and I would definitely stay there again.

Before our trip, I read reviews about this hotel. Overall there were great reviews, but the negative ones concerned me. After my personal experience, I will have to say that this hotel made my romantic Venice trip something I will remember for the rest of my life. The decor was beautiful and the staff was helpful, professional, and accommodating. We can't say nothing but wonderful things about this hotel, its staff and Venice itself. Our room had a review of a small drainage alley (Room #112) but this did not bother us. The room and bathroom are immaculate, and is completely quiet with no noise from the streets or surrounding rooms. My very most favorite part of the room was the bathroom. Gorgeous! The bathroom has 110v outlet, standard Italian outlet, and outlets for other countries. There is a bidet, standard toilet, towel warmer, tub/shower with hand sprayer. There is also a small vanity chair. There is also an emergency pull cord located in the tub area in case assistance is needed. Toiletries included soap, cotton swabs, cotton balls, shampoo, conditioner, and a shower cap. The hotel has a 12 inch color TV with at least 25 stations (3 or 4 in English) and a small free safe. There is a small refrigerator stocked with beverages for sale by the hotel. However, there is enough room for you to place a few things, or you can temporarily remove their items to place your drinks and food items. Some European hotels usually have separate twin beds. Our room had one queen bed - even if it were two beds pushed together, no one fell through any crack. The sheets and towels had the hotel logo on it, and the bed linens were of high thread count - which made the cotton comfortable and restful to sleep on. The breakfast served in the morning is fantastic. There is fresh fruit, several types of bread, two types of cheese, salami, ham, and bologne, cold cereal with milk, various pasteries, various juices and milk. Cappucino, coffee, and tea is included. One review I read complained that there were no eggs for breakfast. Please note that the breakfast I described above is part of the free meal included with the room. There is a menu on all tables in which supplementary items can be ordered for an extra cost. We felt the breakfast was quite appealing, ample, and satisfying. The dining room was cozy, clean, with friendly and accommodating staff. The hotel does offer laudry services, though there is a self laundry about 10 minutes from the hotel (sorry, I can't describe where it is). The hotel is in the Cannaregio District near the Jewish Ghetto. A canal in in front of and behind the hotel. We arrived at the Marco Polo Airport and took a water taxi to our hotel. However, to get to the island of Venice, one can drive, take the train (Trenalia), fly in, or by boat. There are no cars on Venice other than at the portion in the beginning part of the island. Be sure to have luggage with wheels and pack only what is necessary. It is approxiately 15 - 20 minutes walk to St. Mark's Square (San Marcos Square). If you don't mind being in a quieter area away from the hustle and bustle, this is the place to be. With regard to meals, the majority of restaurants close from about 2 p.m. and re-open at approximately 6:30 p.m. Some bars or pizza places may be open. If you want to buy stamps, there are only a few places to buy them (actual Italian post offices). I had read that Tobacco shops (Tabacchi) shops sold stamps but every time I went into one, they told me they didn't sell them. The cost of sending a post card or letter to the United States is 0.80 Euros (at this time of this writing). I have seen post cards as low as 0.20 Euros each to 0.50 Euros each for the same postcards. As someone said in a previous post, is there is a little grocery store in front of the hotel across the bridge. As last words of wisdom, be sure to get Euros from the ATM instead of a foreign exchange company, as you will get a better exchange rate and you will not be charged a high fee to ge the Euro. There will not be anyone to help you with your bags if you are going to the train station or have to move around so have luggage with wheels and bring minimal luggage. Unfortunately, some parts of Europe is not as friendly for those physically challenged, and Venice is one of them. Be prepared to do a lot of walking.

Just returned from a 3 day trip to Venice staying at the Mori d'Oriente. Read most of the reviews here before travel. Have the folowing points to add. As advised, we bought the 3 day ACTV passes (72 hours from the moment you start using the pass)at 22 euros, and found them to be of good value if you like to hop on and off the Vaporetto often. We didn't use them that much on the first day because we arrived late and we did a lot of walking, but we more than made up for their uses in the next 2 days. The Tourist Information booth from which we bought our passes did not accept credit card. We had to pay by cash. We also followed the advice from here and bought 2 Alilaguna tickets from Marco Polo airport to arrive at Venice by water. It was certainly a different experience, and I would recommend doing it once. However, the service was infrequent with only 1 sailing per hour, so prepare to wait. You should take the BLU line which takes 38 minutes to get you to Fondamente Nove. Get alight there and walk a few yards to the next pier (look for the ACTV sign, and validate your ticket). Take a number 41 Vaporetto and (Maddona del) Orto is the next stop. For the return trip to the airport, we use the bus. We took a Vaporetto from Orto to Piazzale Roma and took a D5 (orange)bus to the airport. Since the orange bus was run by ACTV, the 3-day pass was valid on it. The trip took about 15 minutes and terminated just outside the airport. Apart from saving 10 Euros, we found the bus trip pleasant and fast, provided you do not have a lot of luggage. The hotel was almost as good as was described here. Staff were helpful, spoke perfect English. Room was clean and well equipped apart from lack of tea/coffee making facility. A well-stocked minibar if you're so inclined. However, a snack size pringle will set you back by 2.5 Euros. So you will be better off to get your snacks from a small supermarket just across the canal in Calle del Forno (1 minute's walk). The hotel is served by two vaporetto stops - Orto (3-4 minute's walk) in the north and S. Marcuola (6-7 minute's walk) in the south. In between the two stops and along the length of the island lies the main street. We spent many happy hours walking up and down this main street route from the hotel to Rialto, then onward to Piazza San Marco. The route is lined with numerous shops and eateries, a few churches and a few squares. The closer you get to San Marco, the grander are the shops. There are a lot of road signs around the area, so if you get yourself familiar with a few names such as Rialto, S. Marco, P. Roma, and their relative locations. You should be able to find your way round. Before the trip, I read about how expensive it was to eat in Venice. I am glad to report differently. You can eat quite well and quite cheaply. The key is \"menu turistico\" (tourist menu). You can find a menu turistico in the S Marco area for 16-18 Euros. We found one nearer to the hotel for 11 Euros. For that, you can have a seafood pasta starter, a grill sole main course, and a side salad or french fries. I think this is fantastic value, as I can remember recently spending twice that amount in a similiar setting restuarant in the suburb of Paris. The eatery is Trattoria da Mimo,located on Rio terra San Leonardo, about 5 minute's walk from the hotel. I believe if you pick a tourist menu at any restaurant, the coperato (bread and cover charge) is waived. The hotel offers a complementary boat service to the Island of Murano- famous for its glass-blowing industry. We had a water-taxi specially came and picked us up at the hotel, so we had the enjoyment of riding a water-taxi without the cost, right? But there is no free lunch in this world. At the factory, we were assigned a sale-rep to help us with our purchase. Although he kept saying there was no obligations to buy, the pressure was on. The design and quality of the exhibits were amazingly good with price to match. We ended up buying a glass-mosaic display bowl for 150 euros. Venice is a fascinating place, and November, in my opinion, is a good time to visit it when the place is not so packed with visitors and good hotels such as Mori d'oriente are running special offers.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice little hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4125944", "Content": "This was our first stop in Italy.

I am tired of leaving hotels hungry and having to buy food a short time later. The hotel was spotless and well cared for, the decoration sumptious the staff polite and non-intrusive. My only disappointment was that we were given a standard room when we had paid for a deluxe room through Expedia(-). When we pointed this out we were told that sometimes rooms were sold as deluxe on websites even though the price was for a standard room. (I am afraid I did not believe that one!) We paid approx \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1500 for 7 nights. We were told they had no deluxe rooms that night but that they would investigate the matter and hopefully move us to a deluxe the following day which they did. I must say that the standard room was lovely but we had paid for the bigger room. They sent us a bottle of prosecco to compensate, though I must say we got no refund on the price difference. That being said we did not ask for one but I feel they should they have offered themselves. This review is a tad late but the comments are still valid. We are going on a cruise from Venice next year and the Ai Mori is one of the pre-cruise hotels to choose from and without hesitation we have chosen it for a couple of nights before our journey.

It is about a 15 minute walk to the train station, 20 minutes to the Rialto, 30 minutes to the Accademia, and about 40 minutes to San Marco. Because it was very hot and humid when we were there, we did not use the vaporetto after one ride as it took about an hour to go to San Marco and then we would begin our walks. Also, on a hot humid day the vaporetto ride felt all too much like a subway ride in NYC in rush hour in the summer--not too pleasant and SRO. There are a few reasonably good restaurantsa close by, but for the most part you need to walk at least 15-20 minutes to get to most places to eat. The staff of the hotel was very nice and helpful. The breakfasts were fine. I'm not sure what the writers who dissed the breakfasts were expecting; we found the selection reasonably good, considering the room rates and the high costs in Venice. We attended a performance at a scuola grande of \"Cosi fan tutti\" which was very reasonably priced for Venice and enjoyed the Tiepello museum tour which preceded the performance. The opera is a shortened version with costumed singers but no sets. It is done in a very small room in a 17th century baroque setting that was quite stunning. And while otyhers were dressed as if they were attending a performance at La Scala, I wore shorts knowing that it would be very hot in the room. It was! The singers were very good.

Wow, it exceeded expectations. I had already upgraded us to a \"junior suite\" as it was our honeymoon and couldnt have chosen a more perfect location. On a lovely quiet Fondamenta canal, the hotel is everything it says - very nice plush decor and very clean. Our suite was called a junior because it didnt actually have a seperate lounge room, just a large bedroom with tabel, chairs and chaise longue. But best of all, the shutters opended directly onto the canal - perfect! Waking up in the morning, opening the shutters and dozing to the sounds of the canal waking up was wonderfu. The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful. Best of all were the breakfasts - huge range of filled croissants and bread, juices, yoghurts, hams, cheese, cereals, fruit etc along with your own pot of gorgeous coffee or hot chocolate. Location of the hotel was perfect for us, we liked the quiet canal and the very pleasant walk to the rialto/san marco areas - no more than 15 mins.

Nearest stop (orto) is only 5 minutes walk so handy to catch the waterbus or get to hotel from airport. We cannot wait to return to the hotel and hopefully to the same room if we can afford. Our experience was \"made\" by that canal view room and I'm so glad I did it. Can't really comment on the standard rooms as we didnt see any but they are probably quite small though beautifully decorated. Its probably the best hotel either of us have ever stayed in and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending it - especially Room 102 to honeymooners! It was a very special stay and we loved the slippers and hotel robes and little extras that easily make this a 4 star+ hotel.

It was great to be able to come back from the crowds around the usual tourist haunts of San Marco Piazza, Rialto Bridge etc. and have predominantly peace and tranquility to enjoy. A great location for easily accessing the vaporretta. The Madonna D'Orte stop is approx 5 - 10 min walk from the hotel and you can then catch numerous water buses in either direction around the island. A good tip for those travelling to the island from the airport is to catch the Alilaguna water bus to the Fondamente Nove stop and then get the 41/51 (could be 42/52 -check the direction) to the Madonna D'Orte stop. Its about 30 mins from the airport and one of the cheapest modes of transport to get to the hotel. The journey back to the airport is the reverse of above. Our room (no.3) in the hotel was a deluxe double on the ground floor. The room was designated as a disabled persons room with a shower room type arrangement for the bathroom. Be careful, you need to ensure the shower curtain is completely shut around you otherwise you 'flood' the bathroom floor! The finishes and furniture were were sumptuous and of ancient Turkish style. The bed was comfortable although we could have done with a little more storage space than that on offer. One slight disadvantage of this room is it is located next to the automatic opening door leading to the hotel room blocks to the rear of the property. So you do hear the door opening when you are in the room, which can be a little disturbing at night - but you get used to it. Breakfast is a limited cold continental buffet, with extra hot dishes available at an extra cost from the inclusive breakfast rate. The dining room is pleasant and the staff are attentative and friendly and most of them speak good english and engage with the guests - a nice personal touch that goes a long way for me when assessing quality of service.

If you don't like to walk you either need to hike to the Vaporetto (scenic but slow, you kill an hour) or call for a water taxi (quicker, but expensive). This was the third Italian hotel we stayed at, and all the double beds were truly doubles--two beds pushed together--but this was the only hotel where the beds are made up like two singles. The sheets were tucked into the crack in the middle, and the beds separated easily. At the other hotels the beds were sheeted like doubles and didn't separate. Here, a person could fall in the crack and get hurt. It almost happened to me! Still, I loved our three-night stay here. For myself, I'd go back there tomorrow. My wife doesn't walk so well, and if she is with me, I'd look for someplace more centrally located, maybe between Rialto and San Marco.", "Date": "June 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cQuiet and Comfortable\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3514591", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel. The room decor is atmospheric without being oppressive. The neighborhood was quiet but had several restaurants within walking distance that were reasonably priced and good. Vaporetto stops were about 10 minutes away in both directions. There was a market closeby and a busy throughfare with shops and restaurants about ten minutes away. The breakfast room was lovely and the staff most accomodating. The air conditioning worked great! I admit the shower door was a little tricky--hard to not splash water. The handheld shower seemed to work better with this arrangement. We booked directly through the hotel and got a reasonable rate for prime season in Venice. Took a water taxi to the airport from the front door of the hotel--what a treat. Expensive but what a way to leave Venice. It is a glorious city with many things to occupy you for days!

Just after I booked, I read the bad review that was posted on here ( the only one I found anywhere!!) and it made me worry. I had no reason to worry though. This Hotel was as good as all the other reviews said and well worth the 5 circles rating on here. The street was clean and really peaceful. The bar at the hotel (inside or on the street by the pretty canal) is brilliant and the service there ( as in the whole of the hotel ) was top quality. The bed was 2 single mattresses but they was inside a double frame (very typical of European hotels) They were the same height, comfy, attached together and in no way could come apart or felt different than a double bed really. We can be quite fussy in terms of hotels but this hotel was clean and the staff were great - helpful, polite and professional. The standard double was a good size with really high ceilings. The aircon worked well and was a great relief from the 30c heat outside! The TV has Eurosport, CNBC, BBC News, CNN, and an exclusively English speaking film channel in addition to another film channel (sometimes dubbed) and many other foreign channels The location also did not dissapoint. It is not in the centre of the tourist trap and this is a good thing. It is only a few minutes walk to the nearest Vaporetto stop (which is the best way to get around anyway) and that can take you anywhere you need to be. There are some great restaurants nearby (our favourite was sitting outside in the courtyard at Al Bacco, Fondamenta Capuzine) From the directions on here, and the website, we had no problems finding the hotel although is worth taking a map though just in case (one of the bridges was closed when we arrived and we had to take a slight detour). One final top tip is that there is a small supermarket very near for things like water etc. - Go out the front doors, turn right, over the first bridge (on the left) and straight on down the alley ahead of you, and it is on the left hand side. ( you will only see it when it is open as it draws the shutters when it is not) Sorry for the length of this post but we had such a great time here, I wanted to encourage others to do the same!

It is located at a quite corner. I encountered some difficulties to locate the hotel when I reached there late night. But not too bad after a helpful waiter gave me some directions. About the price - 165Euro/night. I think is average in Venice. Venice hotel prices are always on the high side. About the room - If you are given room 401, REJECT and CHANGE the room! My first night is in this room. This is a room which is \"detached\" from the main hotel building. I got drenched in the rain while walking to my room from the lobby. (It was raining on my first day there). The room door is just next to the a door leading to a alley. It is still very cold in mid April, with the raining, it is worst. This room is SO cold that I could not sleep. I have to turn on the shower, and filled the tub with hot water in order to warm the room. The floor is not even carpeted, no slippers provided. I logged a complaint on the second day and wish to get the room change. The front desk's said that hotel is full, but later the hotel manager called and I got a room change into the \"main hotel building\". However, I had to say the rooms(both rooms I have been to), are very clean and nice, almost flawless. I think this is a very new hotel. About the breakfast - Spread is OK, waiters are nice.

The marble bathroom was spacious and along with the room, spotlessly clean.

The location is excellent: it takes no more than a 15 minutes walk to get to the hotel (with a slow pace) from the railway station: there is no need to take any transportation mean, really, unless you have a lot of very bulky , heavy luggage or feel extremely tired. We booked our room via Expedia and got a very convenient rate, breakfast included. Breakfast itself was nothing to scream about but it was certainly much better than what you would normally get in most 4 star hotels in Italy.

We chose it based on Tripadvisor review comments, and were not disappointed. The front desk staff we dealt with spoke very fluent English, were always courteous, offered maps of the city and information on tours at check-in, and wake up calls and vaporetto transportation information as requested. The location of the hotel proved to be very fortunate for us; it is not only a short walk from the Madonna del Orto vaporetto stop (vaporetto numbers 51/52) but Canareggio as a district was both quiet and full of the kind of retail establishments that made our walks pleasant and interesting. We saw the side canals near the hotel being used in a way that we had not thought of.. specially equipped boats to transport garbage and laundry from the homes and the hotels in the district. Walking was no problem no matter where we went. It had snowed in Venice two days before we arrived and there was plenty of it on the ground; it was somewhat strange to see a big part of Piazza San Marco (in the shade) under a sheet of ice while we walked in bright sunshine. Our room (Room 1) was equipped for service for the disabled, was quite spacious and overlooked a private courtyard. We found the bedcovers always turned down when we returned to our room each evening... a nice touch. The room could best be described as sumptuous, decorated in a Middle Eastern style in warm red and orange colours. According to the history of the hotel, at one time the building housed Turkish traders who were part of the important maritime activity in Venice. The complimentary breakfast was served in a spacious room off the main lobby and was extremely generous: meat, cheese, fruit, crossoint, cereal. fruit juice, and our favourite hot drink, Earl Grey tea. Food in Venice is a bit more expensive than in other big cities in Italy, and the hotel breakfast gave us a good start to our day. With light snacks during the day, we could easily manage till dinner time. We considered the hotel extremely good value for the Euro 85 price we prepaid in US dollars.
