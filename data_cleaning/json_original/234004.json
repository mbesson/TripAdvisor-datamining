The hotel is situated in a busy residential section. While inside the hotel was very quiet, with nearby construction and the traffic outside - it is definitely not a place for peace and relaxation. The staff while very professional, definitely come across as somewhat cold and hardly welcoming. Even the young ladies attending to the buffet in the morning, were somewhat stand-offish. Our first visit, we stayed in a deluxe room that was quite large, with a huge bathroom and plenty of light. It was comfortable and very clean. Between the heat and the noise, it was the first time I wished they was AC. On our way home, we stayed in a smaller comfort room upstairs. Even that room was a generous size with a large bathroom and clawfoot tub. The hotel guests tend to be European business travelers, thus it is fairly quiet. It is not far from the main boulevard with shops and restaurants. Would definitely recommend taking note of where your hotel is when you go out, especially since the street names are somewhat different on the maps. Not too far, is an excellent Gelato shop frequented by the locals.While there was nothing terribly wrong with this hotel, I think next time I would opt for something a little larger, perhaps more welcoming towards tourists such as myself.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR263316257", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "deardiva"}, {"Content": "NICE BOUTIQUE HOTEL We have just returned from a 3 nights stay at the hotel.

We flew across the Atlantic and arrived in Frankfurt at 8:00 am. Even though check in was not until 3:00pm, we went directly to the hotel and arrived at 9:00am. The reception we received couldn\u9225\u6a9b have been warmer or friendlier. They said they would give us the first available room and suggested we enjoy their continental breakfast, which was excellent and far better than most continental breakfasts, while we waited for the room to be made up. We received our room key at 9:45 am. The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. We really liked our room as well as the proximity to downtown. Walking downtown was easy and enjoyable. Our choice of hotels was an excellent one, far better than we hoped.A previous reviewer suggested going to the Exhil Restaurant around the corner. We did this and found the manager both haughty and rude. We wondered if it was because we don\u9225\u6a9b speak German. We left and found an Italian restaurant, the Portofino around another corner of the hotel, and were very pleased.I can\u9225\u6a9b recommend the Villa Orange strongly enough.", "Date": "Dec 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR477576795", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GreatAdvice"}, {"Content": "Thank you Villa Orange!

Very disappointed! I recently stayed at Villa Orange after reading many positive reviews. Photos on the website also made it appear a lovely boutique hotel.On check-in the staff were abrupt, disinterested and rude. There was no attempt at welcoming guests to the hotel and no explanation of facilities.Whilst the bathroom was pleasant, the room itself was tired, shabby and unappealing. The bed had a single duvet and pillow plonked in the middle with greying covers - not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel. In addition, the road outside was very noisy and noise from inside the hotel was also a problem. As a business woman travelling on my own, key criterion for any hotel is that it feels safe and welcoming. Unfortunately Villa Orange did not live up to this.I would not recommend this hotel to other guests, particularly as there are plenty of other options in Frankfurt.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR991437736", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "pleasant stay Villa Orange is a pleasant small hotel hotel, conveniantly located in city centre Frankfurt.
