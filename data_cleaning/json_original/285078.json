Firstly, this place is very convenient. It is located within minutes to the Greyhound terminal and the Metro (subway station). Secondly, it's right in downtown. Now to the criticisms... After checking in, I went to my room and upon entering the room smelt like someone had been smoking in there. When I lifted up the blanket to check the bed sheet, I saw two strands of hair. At that point I wondered if they changed the bed sheets. I went upstairs to ask the receptionist whether it was a non-smoking room. I was told that it's a non-smoking hotel. It definitely smelt like cigarette smoke and they were using some kind of air freshener to mask the stink. The shower door is mouldy. In the morning, I smelt someone burning Indian incense and the whole hallway smelt like incense. At least incense doesn't stink like cigarette but I suspect non-smoking indoors applies to incense as well! The person cleaning the room could do better with better personal hygiene. After he left the room, the b.o. lingered for a while. The ac wasn't turned on at night and the room was getting really stuffy. I could feel the springs in the bed. Needless to say, I couldn't get a good night sleep. After reading about the cheap skate breakfast, I decided to skip breakfast and checked out first thing in the morning. You will be charged an extra day as penalty but make sure you ask that they refund you for the rest of the nights not stayed. I did not experience the loud announcement from the Greyhound as some people mentioned here. However I did hear someone moving the furniture upstairs as described by a few people here. Oh, by the first hour of staying in the room, my throat started to itch - perhaps from the smoke. That itch worsened over the days. Three days later I developed a full blown sore throat - perhaps from the throat irritation. I have always tried to avoid large hotel chains because I strongly believe in supporting the \"small guys\" by staying at boutique hotels. This is certainly a major, major mistake.

On the second night of my stay the room directly above me was occupied and while the residents themselves were fine (no loud music or parties or such), their footsteps while just walking around were very loud and kept me awake even when wearing earplugs. Bottom line - I definitely got my money's worth and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again but only if I could get a room on the top (third) floor.", "Date": "April 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "sg", "Title": "\u201cbudget room\u201d", "Author": "breefree", "ReviewID": "UR3276695", "Content": "this place is okay. i stayed once last year, and am staying again this year. the room i stayed in was an extra large closet. the front desk is very alert, b/c there are some \"less desirables\" who walk up and down this street. i am hoping that the parking lot will be safe for my car, as i might drive up this time. there is a parking lot up the street a little ways. i saw another reviewer say that it was not very expensive, so this is a good thing. *b*", "Date": "March 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cgood value\u201d", "Author": "Ravenscryy", "ReviewID": "UR2862147", "Content": "Went to Montreal in November for a long weekend with my girlfriend.

Its actually just a simple motel- nothing fancy, no elevator, no real amenities other than some free soap and shampoo and a tv with cable. But it was a good price and we found free on-street parking, which was great. Our room, as spartan as it was, was very clean. We did not hang out in the room much anyways. It is about a 15 min walk to the heart of St Catherine St and Crescent St. Not a bad area at all, as long as you don't mind walking.

It usually has rooms available. It's in a street with lots of very cheap hotels (which we haven't dared to explore yet) and the bus terminal is close by. It's fairly new, and the furnishings of the rooms are functional and clean, but it has no charm. On weekends we usually park on the street, but there is also a small parking lot close by which you can book through the hotel. Each room has cable TV. There is no breakfast room, you just pick up your coffee and muffin at the desk and eat in your room. In principle you can walk to the pedestrian zone with all the restaurants (or to the Latin Quarter) , but we usually take the car since it's not that close. During the winter you can often get better deals in one of the fancier hotels, but in the summer this hotel is a good value.", "Date": "March 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuite okay for the price.\u201d", "Author": "Canadian_2004", "ReviewID": "UR1271878", "Content": "a very basic hotel, more like a lodge / motel.
