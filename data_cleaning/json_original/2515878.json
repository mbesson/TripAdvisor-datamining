The resort was excellent for easy access to food and all the parks, which are all just a quick bus ride away. There is also the fun option of taking a riverboat to several places, like Downtown Disney. The room itself is what you would expect from other moderate Disney Resort. It is clean, but the beds are a bit uncomfortable, the comforters and sheets are rough, the shower/toilet room is very tiny, and the provided toiletries only include a shampoo/conditioner and bar soap. The resort does provide free WiFi that is very easy to access, which is an added plus. Each day, house keeping leaves a fun little towel decoration somewhere in the room. When we requested a check out that was 30 minutes later (normal check out is 11am), they would not accommodate our request. Using the Disney Magical Express was excellent, and the resort took care of all of our check-in needs for our airport departure to include checking our bags from the hotel and printing out our boarding passes. All of the hotel staff was very nice; however, there was always a very long wait for the concierge services, no matter what time we stopped by.

My husband is an avid Disney goer, and has been since he was a child (he's been there no less than 25 times). He did hours of research before deciding on this resort. One of the reasons is that it was freshly renovated the summer before our vacation. You could definitely tell things there were new. He said by talking to the lady on the phone, they were really trying to make the trip special for us. They definitely delivered. We loved this place. He reserved on the phone and we got a quiet room on the water, on the end of the building. We even had two windows! It was a little trek from the front, but not bad at all. We got our king bed, and they put a signed \"congratulations!\" picture signed by Mickey and Minnie. We had towel art every day by our housekeepers and the room was clean upon arrival, and clean every single day we were there. We even had to ask housekeeping to come back one morning because we weren't ready yet (to be fair, it was noon). Check in was a breeze, we got there about 5pm, and received buttons that we were just married and our cards. We did not have one single problem with those cards the whole time we were there. It was awesome just scanning them to get into the park or to pay for our meals. The gave us a free dining plan when we reserved and explained the plan well upon check in. One of the very best things about the French Quarter is that it is not overly big compared to the other resorts. It feels more intimate, and it makes things like the food court and the \"streets\" in general less busy. The pool was beautiful. We didn't use it, as we're not pool people, but it looked very well maintained and the kids there were having a blast. We used the buses the entire time we were there. We didn't drive anywhere the entire 2 weeks .... the wait was not long at all (when it was raining it felt long, but it was really only about 15 minutes...) and it was a breeze getting to and from all the parks, and park hopping in between. We didn't even drive to Universal Studios. The concierge set up a bus for us (for a fee) so we didn't have to navigate there either. The staff was friendly, the food court was great (especially when coming in late from the parks to grab a quick bite before heading to your room) and the Port Orleans Riverside was only a short (romantic!) walk from the French Quarter. We ate at the sit down restaurant there twice because we liked it so much the first day. We also loved how you could take a boat to Downtown Disney. Our room was right next to the river, so it took us about 3 minutes to get the to dock. A really nice boat ride later, you're Downtown. The bed was comfy, though, after 12 hours of a theme park, any bed is awesome. We stayed for two weeks there and never had any sort of problem. The only \"bad\" things (not even really bad) were we had a very excited little boy staying in the room next to us and his parents would let him run up and down the hallways in the morning. But, it was about 8:00, it was almost time to get up anyway. And, because we were on the water, you could hear the boats honking as they passed at night. This was only until 11pm or midnight though, and by the time we were 2 days in, I didn't even notice it anymore. We were so pleased with our stay here, and we had an absolutely magical honeymoon. I would stay here again in an instant, but will most likely be trying the other resorts, as I've married into a Disney family. I would highly recommend this resort to a vacationing couple, or like anywhere in Disney, a family.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New London, Connecticut, United States", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Place!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Sarah G", "ReviewID": "UR129204387", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon & we were amazed at the friendly service that we got from the moment we stepped off the bus to when we left.

I found the grounds very quiet and peaceful. The one noise problem are the air-pressure forced toilets which will wake you up in the early morning hours when your neighbors start getting ready for the day. The grounds are very pretty and well kept. Many gardens and courtyards. The rooms were nicely decorated and maintained, but the bathrooms are a bit small. I'm not a big guy and I had to step out of the way of the door in order to close it. Remember to close your drapes or use the privacy curtain in the vanity area, as you have other guests walking right by the windows of your room. I found the transportation very good. Only once did I wait more than 15 minutes for a bus to/from a theme park. Most times it was under 10 minutes and many times under 5 minutes. Commuting times were good. In the morning we had our own dedicated bus service, but in the afternoons/evenings it was shared with the Riverside section of the resort. Staff was very friendly and helpful, but didn't have that \"spark\" associated with many Disney cast members. Food court was fine. Had some different selections - jambalya, po' boys, pot roast - not usually found in other Disney food courts. There is no table service restaurant, but who really dines at their resort? If you want, the Riverside portion has a table service restaurant, Boatwrights, but be warned... it's Southern cooking and I found it a little heavy. I was a little disappointed they don't have what is referred to as a \"quiet pool\" - a place for adults to relax without the noise of kids. You are welcome to use the quiet pools at the Riverside branch of the resort. Overall, I enjoyed this resort and would stay there again (after investing in a sound machine to try to muffle the sound of those roaring toilets.)", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA Perfect Choice\u201d", "Author": "susanwhittaker", "ReviewID": "UR129085620", "Content": "We couldn't have chosen a nicer place to stay :) This was our second trip to Disney but our first stay at a Disney Hotel and we were not disappointed. The hotel and its surroundings were lovely and visiting at Easter I was expecting crowds of people, and whilst it was busy, there was never a feeling of overcrowding or masses of people. Everything was well maintained and the staff were always very helpful and welcoming, a special mention has to go to 'Rich', such a happy chap that brightens your day. The disney transportation from the FQ is very good, we never waited too long for the bus to any of the parks we visited and they were extremely helpful with my dad who has a disability and had to use a mobility scooter. The bus drivers treated my dad with the upmost respect something you don't always see and most guests were very patient whilst the drivers helped him on the buses and then allowed us as a family to board on first. I would like to take this opportunity and thank those guests for their understanding. The food court is typically fast food style choice, which is expected but served us well when we did choose to eat there. One tip would be to purchase the plastic drinks cup, its approx. $15 and you can top up on cold or hot drinks throughout your stay at the hotel and its well worth the money. The pool & pool area is very clean and was always kept spotless. Towels are plentiful and you don't need to take your own. The rooms have hairdryers and irons, so again you don't need to take your own. There are a huge amount of positives about the FQ and staying in a Disney Hotel but there is room for improvement albeit small ones....wardrobes in the double rooms would help as the rail space is very limited when there is a family of you. Also, the cleanliness of the room was a bit hit and miss which surprised me because the main hotel was always kept very clean. Also, the boat to DTD was a bit of a nightmare. It collects people from Riverside first and only leaves a certain amount of places for those staying at FQ which meant we waited approx 50 mins for the experience and then the trip was in the dark! None of these would put me off going back, I would just take less clothes for space and take the bus and not the boat for DTD. Everything is made easy for you when you stay at a Disney Hotel, you can charge purchases to your room card, so you don't have to carry money around. You can organise purchases to be delivered to your room so you don't have to carry stuff around. It's little simple things that make life easier. We paid for the Fantasmic Dinner Package, which was well worth the money. The food was lovely and we were able to walk straight in to sit down for the show as the package offers reserved seating. No standing in the queue for ages. Also paid for evening dinner in Cinderella's Castle. After reading mixed reviews on this, I was wondering if we had wasted our money but we didn't. It was a lovely memorable experience and worth it. The children got the opportunity of meeting the princesses on a one-to-one basis in lovely surroundings. It was very special and one we will always remember. I would recommend this experience and the food was nice, a change from fast food! We went shopping at the largest of the Outlet Stores (near Sea World) and picked up some bargains. The Hotel organised a taxi for us and gave us an idea on cost for journeys outside of Disney (for those who are not intending to drive) so we were able to venture out to Universal and Sea World. Its all made very easy for you and everyone is helpful when you do need advice. We travelled with Virgin on our frist trip to Orlando and then First Choice Holidays for this most recent holiday. Out of the two, I would choose Virgin. The weather was gorgeous, a few cloudy days which you are pleased about when walking around the parks and it was raining/thundering on our last two days but the majority of time it was hot sunshine and definitely short and t-shirts. I didn't want to come back, I wanted to stay in the magical bubble and live in the dream. Its such an amazing place and it takes you away from everyday life and transports you into a happy, magical, special place.

The two Port Orleans resorts are absolutely beautiful. The theming is fantastic, both inside the rooms and out. Service was great. Positive things: 1) Walking around these resorts is great. Nice little workout from one part of the 2 hotels to the other. 2) Riverboat transportation to the Downtown Disney area was nice. 3) The pool area was very nicely themed, and allowed for it to be very full but not feel crowded. Hot tub was not really enclosed, but in a nice secluded area 4) TWO sinks in the pre bathroom area, as well as a curtain you can pull to separate the pre bathroom area from the room. I did have a few gripes though, that prevented me from scoring this 5 stars: 1) Full beds instead of queen beds. \"Doubles\" might be standard in other parts of the country, but almost every hotel in the area has 2 Queen beds when there are two beds in a room, even the cheaper $30 hotels. 2) My bed was super noisy and not comfortable. The other bed in the room was better, but at the point point they should be nicer and newer. The value resorts have nicer beds than this. Granted, this might have been a room that hasn't been upgrade yet, since I know they did a lot of that recently. 3) Fridge has no temperature control, and did not get very cold even after they replaced it once.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Georgia, United States", "Title": "\u201cAmazing vacation!

This is a fantastic resort that is almost perfect. As soon as we arrived we felt totally relaxed, even after a nine and a half hour flight!! The staff are lovely, and can't do enough to help you, we even had a message on our room phone welcoming us!! During the second week of our stay our 5 year old son lost his autograph book that he'd worked hard on filling up and was devasteted. I told the concierge when we got back from the partk in the hope that it had been found, however it had't. The next day when we got back to our room, there was a replacement autograph book, full of character signatures, our son was thrilled, thinking that it was his book and still does not know to this day that this is a replacement!! They had even put his name in the front of it. The rooms are spotless, and kept that way throughout by Mousekeeping, who often leave the children little suprises!! Beds are amazing, we looked at purchasing one when we arrived home, perfect after a long day in the parks. One minor negative could be that there should be DVD players in the room, for those nights you arrive back a little early and would like to relax? Maybe you could hire DVD's to watch during your stay? As there were not any we took advantage of the open air cinema on two occasions, this was a lovely way to wind down at night, the kids loved making their own popcorn in the food hall. Food in the food hall was excellent, everything is cooked fresh and in front of you and there is lots to choose from, we often ate at the Riverside food hall for a change of scenery, and enjoyed the walk along the river to get there. Transportation to the parks was good, and again the drivers were very friendly. When coming home you can catch the French Quarter or Riverside coach if you are prepared for a short 10 minute walk along the river to your room and the boat to Downtown Disney was a lovely change at night. If you are looking for a lovely, quiet, immaculatly presented base to stay during your disneyworld holiday then PO-FQ is deffinately the resort to stay in. We stayed at Riverside last year and found this resort a lot busier, with more people using the trasportation system, therefore there were waits sometimes for coaches.

Unlike PORiverside, FQ is quaint and everything is a very short walk away. We were in building 6 and the pool, food court, and store were only about a 1-2 minute walk. We could also cut through the gardens and be at the bus stop in just as little time. Another nice feature is the river taxi that's available to transport guests to downtown Disney. You get a great view of some of the other resorts and a break from the buses. Speaking of buses, we never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus. Since POFQ is picked up first, often the bus would fill up and we didn't even have to stop at POR. When we did stop at Riverside, it only took around 10 minutes. Also, POFQ is dropped off first, so we never had to go though all the stops at POR. We chose a standard view room, but we had a nice view of some gardens and a fountain. The rooms are nothing special, but they are clean and convenient, which is what you are paying for. Our family always likes that the tub/toilet and sinks are seperate. In addition, the curtain that seperates sleeping quarters is nice early in the morning. When we asked for extra towels, we were accomodated. We were also accomodated when we asked for connecting staterooms, but we did book several months in advance. Almost everyone we encountered on the property was fantastic. We only had a problem with one night shift desk clerk who refused to remove a tip from our room charge. We had paid the tip in cash, but she said without a receipt she would not remove the charge. Even though we were a party of 8 or more, technically tips are still optional, even though they are added to the bill automatically. Even if she did not trust that we paid the tip in cash, which we did, she still should have removed the charge. Overall, POFQ was great. We plan to go back. If your family is like ours, you are in the room very little and when you are, you are sleeping. I say, splurge and go for deluxe dining like we did and go moderate on the room. I'm not a fan of the value resorts and though I love the deluxe resorts, they are not much better when it comes to the room. We found it better to spend the extra money so we could dine in the castle and see dinner shows. It just depends on your preference. Also, for us, we like the PO resorts because they are the closest moderates to Magic Kingdom, the park we spend most of our time in.

The hotel, in my opinion like all Disney resorts, is overpriced for what you get. You pay a premium for being on property, and I understand the concept. For $180 a night, we had a room with two queen beds that had okay mattresses, average linens, and horrible, puny little pillows (and no extras offered in the closet area like many other hotels have) -- the bed quality is what I'd expect at a Hampton Inn (actually, Hampton Inn offers much nicer pillows, but I digress). On par for its price, French Quarter offers a nice vanity area with two sinks separate from the toilet and shower. The shower is a basic motel shower/tub combo with fabric curtain, but ours was clean and had spotless grout. Another \"premium\" item is the mini-fridge. A sub-par offering is the lack of TV stations; while roadside motels boast \"HBO\" on their signs, Disney properties offer only Disney channels and the basic networks. I know, I know, you don't come to Disney to watch TV, but for $180 a night, it would be nice to watch cable TV before falling asleep. The food court is horrible but on par with all the other \"quick service\" Disney dining \"experiences.\" Coffee is Nescafe, and only non-dairy creamer is offered. The food is a cut above what I imagine prison food to be -- everything fried, institutional food service fare. Fortunately we were there only a short time; I can't imagine spending a week and subsisting on that bad food. As I mentioned before, we stayed on Disney property in order to wake up early and hit the parks. At 11:30 pm the night before our big park outing day, we were awoken to the sound of a loud engine that caused our room to vibrate. At first I thought it was some sort of emergency maintenance vehicle, but it went on. My husband dressed and went outside our room, only to see that a construction worker was operating some sort of concrete cutter on a section of the main lobby building that was right next to our room (Building 3). I called the front desk to inquire about the noise, and the polite woman told me that \"they only do the construction at night.\" Thinking I was perhaps just groggy from being awaken, I asked her what exactly she meant. Her reply was, \"So you can hear it?\" Again, she was polite, and she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor. She returned to the line and said she couldn't locate the supervisor but would get back to me ASAP. Did I mention we were planning on getting up early the next day to hit the parks on the one and only day we were visiting Disney? About 10 minutes later, I got a call back from the supervisor. The noise had ceased at that point. The supervisor apologized and told me they told the construction workers to stop. We managed to fall back asleep, and the noise indeed ceased for the night. But the question begs, who in the world thought it would be a good idea to put people in rooms near a noisy construction area with loud noise going on IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? At checkout I mentioned the incident to the \"cast member\" at the front desk. She wanted to know if the situation had been dealt with; I assured her it had ceased, but I wanted to know why it happened in the first place. She was courteous and apologized and said the front desk doesn't always realize when guests can hear construction noise in their rooms. I told her I wouldn't be back and couldn't recommend the property -- I was nice about it, but I still could not fathom why this would have happened at all and how a family resort would think it was OK to run equipment at OSHA-breaking decibel levels in the middle of the night. Upon hearing this, she summoned her manager, who credited me 50% off one night's fare. That seemed fair. Given how the hotel handled the situation, I can't say I won't recommend this hotel. My review stands -- don't expect luxury or even above-average amenities, and don't expect healthy food ... and certainly don't expect a decent cup of coffee, because you won't get one! ;-) I will recommend this: Upon check-in, ask where and when construction will be taking place during your stay.

We have tried several of the Value Resorts as well as the Moderate Resorts and found that the French Quarter is our favorite so far. It is smaller so there is not so much walking to do before getting to the dining room or the bus stop and the riverboat to Downtown Disney was an unexpected surprise. We thought having to ride a bus to our room at the Caribbean Beach Resort after checkin was a real inconvenience and one of the reasons we really liked the French Quarter. I use a mobility scooter so the extra on and off yet another bus at that resort was a pain after getting to the airport, flying and taking the bus to the resort for checkin. Neither of us was ready for that extra bus ride to our room. Our room at the French Quarter was neat and clean. Loved the double sink for dressing in the morning. The dining room was smaller so easier to navigate. The surroundings were beautifully landscaped and maintained - - and it was quiet! We were in building 4 so just a quick trip to the main building and dock area. The bus spot was shaded and we never had to wait for a bus overly long. It seemed the cast member at the stop called in extra buses when needed. This was especially appreciated since the older buses can only take 2 wheelchairs or scooters at a time. The only down side was the invasion of some type of milipede on the last night we stayed. Dreadful things that we were afraid of stepping on in the night. We were on the first floor so will request an upper floor next time with hopes that they could not reach us there.

Breakfast was very hectic and sometimes difficult to find a table - but for the price I thought was reasonable value.

I have lost track of my number of visits in my lifetime & go at least once a year as an adult. I have stayed at every value & moderate property as well as a few of the deluxe resorts. This said, French Quarter may be my new favorite. Keep in mind, Disney moderates are not 4-5 star accommodations. I read some reviews and the complaints seem to me that the people were expecting luxe 5-star city accommodations. This is Disney where it is location, location, location (even though the price you pay may get you luxury somewhere else). The French Quarter has that AND all the necessary accommodations for a comfortable stay. The newly renovated rooms are wonderful. They were clean and very functional -- loved the extra counter space and underneath \"storage\" by the sinks that wasn't there before. We were put in a river view corner king room in building 5 and it was surprisingly quiet considering it was busy \"spring break\" time & I think the resort was at or near capacity. We never heard noise from other rooms other than the toilets (which are quite loud). The resort is definitely much smaller than the other moderates & it never felt over crowded. It really was the best of both worlds though because if you ever felt you needed that large resort feel you could walk on over to Riverside. Our room was only half a mile from the main building at Riverside -- a very easy, scenic walk. The grounds at French Quarter are lovely. I am a runner & many of the other value & moderate resorts leave you running circles in deserted parking lots and along access roads. Port Orleans has a beautiful 2-ish mile path along the river & around both resorts if you enjoy walking or running. If you are debating between the moderates vs. deluxe, the only major differences I found were no table service restaurant (we had a rental car so no big deal) and no gym facility. My last trip was to Saratoga Springs and for twice the price it did NOT have twice the amenities. I would choose French Quarter again!

As far as the location goes, when you pick a Moderate resort, you usually get moderate times to get to the parks. It's great service though! The rooms were nice, although they were a little boring. I would have liked to see a touch of Disney in our room, just to make it extra special. The best thing for our family overall was the Disney wakeup call. Our child loved hearing their favorite Disney character tell them good morning just before we went to the parks.

While we were happy with the hotel, I wasn't really that impressed. The main reason for staying there was because it was one of the smaller Disney hotels which was one of the things we were looking for. We stayed in building 5 and the walk was not bad at all. When we arrived at the airport, we took the bus (Magical Express) to the hotel. It was the first time I've used Magical Express and what a great thing to offer! Loved it!! Our room had 2 queen beds and a decent size bathroom - the sinks were outside of the bathroom which is nice so that you can get ready if someone is in the shower. The beds were terrible. After the first night, all I kept wondering was how I was going to get by another 7 nights on these beds. Someone mentioned asking the front desk and they actually brought up a mattress pad and it was SO much better...so definitely ask for one if you see the beds are not that comfortable. The pool area was really nice and the toddler pool was great too. It was never too crowded either and we were there when the hotel was full to capacity. There is also a little playground near the pool area and our daughters really enjoyed it. The hotel area was nice and clean and well kept. All of the staff that we dealt with were really friendly and always looking to help. For the most part, we didn't eat at our hotel - they don't have a restaurant, just a small food court type of dining. The food was not bad though - my favorite was the quesadilla. They We had the dining plan while we were in Disney, which is great. We used a grocery delivery service and had groceries delivered to the hotel so that they would be there the day we arrived. (We have twin daughters that were 2 and needed milk, diapers, etc - stuff we didn't want to pack from home) so we had the grocery service delivery to the hotel and it was great. The hotel has a place where they store items in the refrigerator, if needed so everything was kept cool. We also purchased snacks and fruit so that we could bring out own with us instead of needing to purchase them. When we checked in to the hotel, they delivered our luggage and groceries within 30 minutes, it was great! The bus service was pretty good. Only once or twice did we have to wait longer than 15 minutes, or wait for another bus since it was full - but being that it was a busy season and the hotel was booked, that was to be expected.

We had a car so I can't comment on the Magic Express or park buses. But overall we loved this hotel. Maybe not the best choice for those looking to be totally immersed in all things Disney - but a nice little retreat after being at the parks all day. Room: 2 queen beds, large bathroom. I didn't find the beds to be uncomfortable but my husband said his back hurt by the last night. The housekeeping left cute towel animals each day, arranged my daughters toys on teh ledge and in her pack n play - which totally made her day. Room was clean, decor was nice. Really appreciated the 2 queen beds - one of the main reasons we chose this hotel in teh first place. We had frieds staying at AKL and I think our room was actually bigger and nicer than theirs (alhtough I'll admit the pool at AKL won by a longshot). We also really likd the big bathroom and the privacy curtain - especially since my husband and I were staying with my mom. Pool: Good size, welll kept. We mainly stayed at the toddler pool - which my daughter loved. No problems getting a table, towels, etc. She also really liked the little playground right next to the pool. Every day they had a couple staff members organizing games and things for the kids - trying to get people to participate. Hotel: We were in building 7 - which was maybe a 3 minute walk from the lobby and pool area. The grounds are beautiful - we walked along the river and watched the boats. The landscaping and little fountains around the grounds were beautiful. Everything seemed clean and well maintained. The staff was friendly whenever I called or asked for something. We espeically liked the size of the grounds - everything was close together. We took a drive through the Riverside area and was amazed at how big it was - totally different atmosphere that the FQ. Food: We ate several meals in the food court and was pleasantly surprised. This was the area I had the lowest expectations for but we actually thought the food was pretty good. It was busy during breakfast rush but at dinner time it was pretty calm. They had a little TV showing cartoons and a coloring area for kids.

None of the rooms are far from the bus stop, and the riverboat down to Down Town Disney is lovely, the sound of the boats going by soothing. Really, its a lovely spot to enjoy a little R&R between trips to the parks. I stayed in a riverview room in building 2, and I would heartily recommend going the riverview route. Waking up and looking out straight onto the river is just lovely, we took our coffee out onto the walkway both mornings to enjoy the peace and quiet and the restful morning river.

The lifeguards were attentive and alert. What I did have an issue with regarding this resort, and is the reason I will be thinking long and hard before I return, was the service given by the staff. Check in was long, rude and unhelpful. We later found out that we had not been checked into the magical express for our return journey, the staff were again rude and unhelpful, just giving me a number to call to rearrange. Of course, that still did not work and we had to spend half an hour with guest services the next morning to get it fixed, missing rope drop at my favourite park and a bad taste in my mouth on my last day at Disney. Bell services however were consistently great - beyond helpful and just lovely. Rude and unhelpful is not something I have come to expect, so this stay with Disney was tinged with disappointment.

This resort, unlike other moderate resorts is spaced close together so you are never far from any other building, including the main building where the restaurant is located. The bus stop is also very close by and the pool is centrally located. The food at Sassagoula is so-so with the beignets being the star attraction. My biggest problem with Sassagoula is that there isn't as much seating availability as in other food courts, but you are able to grab a table outside since the patio is under a lot of shade trees. This means that you also get to experience the view from the river. For food, you're better off hiking to Riverside, which has a lot more options or making reservations at another resort/park restaurant. The rooms at PO-FQ are surprisingly quiet. My husband and I paid for a waterview room which ended up overlooking the pool and even with a lot of people in the pool area, the room was quiet. The only big drawback: the elevators are a mission to find so you end up lugging your stuff up and down the stairs. As for the remainder of the resort, the main building was under construction while we visited, making it a bit inconvenient, but the few extra steps won't kill you. The resort has lots of little paths between the buildings that are ideal for an evening stroll and the river path has a very calming effect. The boat to downtown disney is also a great option, but beware: a stiff breeze will shut them down. While the pool could use a makeover and the food court can stand an expansion, the ability to use all of the amenities (including the pools and AMAZING restaurants) at PO-FQ's sister resort (Port Orleans - Riverside) make up for it. There are a lot of activities that can be enjoyed at both resorts, such as bike riding, carriage rides, fishing, movies, boat rentals, etc. This also means, however, that disney busses stop at both resorts during a trip, making it hard to get a seat or get off quickly.

Very clean, no complaints at all) The reason why we switched over was because on our fifth day, we came back to our room from the parks and discovered an outbreak of unknown bugs/ants in our room. We had never seen these types of ants before- it was absolutely disgusting. They were right by the door/window/surrounding floor area. Within minutes, there were more and more. We stayed in building 2, on the first floor. I called the main front desk right away and told them about the issue and they said they would contact pest control and we'd get a call back from someone asap. However, we didn't receive a call and had to keep calling the front desk. During this waiting period, we packed up our belongings because we surely were not going to spend the rest of our trip in a bug infested room. About 40 minutes later, a bellman arrived and took our luggage and told us that we'd be speaking to the manager who would switch us over to a nice room at the Riverside resort. The bellman informed us that the bugs looked like 'argentine ants'. The bellman and manager 'Boris' were kind and tried to cheer us up. We were given new room keys, everything was sorted out pretty quickly. We were then driven to the Riverside resort and shown where everything was/buses, the restaurant, etc.\u00a0 Prior to this stay, we have only stayed at a deluxe resort but I had read so many great reviews about this resort so I thought what the heck- let's give it a try. The grounds are cute, the sassagoula river boat system to downtown Disney was great, building 2 where we stayed was near the buses and the pool but this ants situation really threw off my mood that night! After seeing how nice and clean our new room at the Acadian house was, we instantly cheered up and tried to forget about the whole ordeal.

I liked the feature of being able to draw the curtain at the sink area so you could get out of the shower and have a private dressing area.

The French Quarter is the smallest of Disney's resort hotels and feels very laid back and relaxed when compared to say the Contemporary, Caribbean Beach or All-Star Movies but it doesn't lack for quality, the grounds are always immaculate and there is a lot of space for kids to let off steam as well as a good sized pool with slide and a small hot tub. Jazz music plays in the background but is never so loud as to be a nuisance and really adds to the Mardi Gras atmosphere that's carried over into the reception and food court. Dining options are typical Disney offerings but with a few New Orleans twists such as muffaletta, po'boys & beignets and quality is okay but it can get a little repetitive if you're only using the food court here, we tend to eat in the parks or at Downtown Disney when we stay in order to to change it up a bit, or if you have a car it's not far to the various family restaurants down the 192. There's a laundromat on site if you need to do any washing, as well as the usual video arcade and gift shop. The shop stocks a small range of toiletries / medicines but its not extensive so stock up beforehand if you don't want to go off site for stuff. Rooms aren't what you'd call large but since we only sleep there it's not a problem and there's plenty of room for two although 4 adults might be pushing it. Beds are always comfy with plenty of pillows (I wish Disney would do away with the blankets though thats just a personal pref) and the AC is easy to adjust. You also get a table, chairs, mini fridge and coffee maker plus the usual Disney toiletries and lots of good quality towels. Internet is available but at almost ten dollars for a day you end up feeling a bit resentful when you only need 30 minutes to check a few emails (so if you have an email equipped cellphone, take it!) Vanity area was spotlessly clean with 2 good-sized sinks, bathroom also clean although a little stained around the corners in places. No complaints though. Transport to all the Disney parks is via bus, there's only one bus stop here but we've never had a problem with not getting on buses and they also start running early enough in the morning for you to be able to get to the park or surrounding hotels for the various character breakfasts. Occasionally the buses go or return to the parks via Port Orleans Riverside resort which is much larger but don't panic if this is the case, they will take you home in the end! One of things we really enjoy about FQ is getting the riverboat from here to Downtown Disney, it's a relaxing 15-20 minute trip and a lovely way to start or round off the day. Coming back along the river at twilight is very atmospheric, especially when you encounter the horse drawn carriages clopping around the lanes. If you fancy a change of eats, you can walk over to the Riverside section and visit the food court there and this is also where you pick up the horse drawn carriages. Staff are always cheerful and polite here and we've never had any problems with poor service, even at those hectic whole coach party checking in times. Cleaning staff / room service are always polite and just as they do in other Disney hotels, will arrange your stuffed toys, towels etc into amusing poses or patterns - something we always looked forward to seeing when we got back at night. It's always Mardi Gras here so if you have kids (or indeed if you're just a kid at heart) don't forget to collect all those strings of beads that turn up around the resort, we found them not only in the gift shop but also in the food court, concierge desk, check in desk and even in the taxi office. At certain times they also have activities for children out on the 'green' by the pool including discos, treasure hunts, various competitions and Disney movies screened outdoors. This is our favourite Disney resort, it never feels crowded even at busy times like Easter and Halloween and we always feel welcome here.

This resort was suggested as it is the smallest one and would be quieter for us. The room was beautiful. We had a corner room on the top floor so we never heard another person our whole week. Fridge was handy for drinks so we didnt have to always go back to the food court. Nice table and chairs and window bench so you arent always hanging out in bed when in the room. I loved that in the evenings there was a different Disney movie shown out in the court yard and there was staff there handing out large towels to sit on the grass. We even saw a bunny one night. Dining options are limited as the resort is small but it was great for breakfast and most of our meals we were away for anyways. We had our towel Mickey when we arrived and the next day there were two swans inside the Mickey. One day we returned from the parks and found a picture of Mickey and Minnie that said congrats in a folder for us to add a picture of ourselves and display together. My husband got sick and the staff were great at helping him get to a clinic and have medication delivered; the clinic had someone come pick him up and bring him back. A couple days later we had to go to the Emergency room and the conseirge gave us a voucher to cover the cab there and back. There was some work being done but it didnt take away from our wonderful experience. We were heading off to the Bahamas for a week afterwards so it was also nice that they have a laundry area easily accessible. Our experience with the bus was great. Each time we were picked up we went straight to the park with no more stops to pick people up. After a show at the polynesian we had to take a bus to downtown disney then from there back to our resort; the bus driver asked where we were going and ended up taking us directly to our resort.

I do not mean to bash the resort but there is a SERIOUS LIMITATION for families w/tweens/teens (more below) or anyone who is expecting to use a pool/hottub (see below). The room itself was lovely and had a brilliant design, def an upgrade from All Star where we stayed last, more space, two Q beds (v. doubles @ AS), flat screen tv, fridge, and a curtained off dressing & bath area that was ingenious (allowing people to dress in privacy, great for families) The curtained off area had a lovely tile floor (main room was plush carpet); double sink was also in this area w/a hairdryer, ironing bd & iron & small in wall safe (only big enough for wallets etc.). The toilet/shower also had its own door behind the curtain. So the dressing and bathroom areas had complete privacy, great for families! Kudos to the design team for this layout! The buildings, grounds, & room design itself were brilliant, altho be warned there are 7 buildings so it can be a wallk from the main bldg to your building, they are kind of spread out over about a mile I think, but on the up side only three floor high and completely charming. Tres New Orleans style and grounds design, walking paths, fountains etc. But we were traveling w/a teen son and I just want to warn others: the pool was a KIDDIE POOL. It was absolutely useless to us. It looks lovely on screen but it about 3-4 feet deep and completely toddler oriented. That would be ideal if you are traveling w/young children, don't get me wrong; if that's you, then do not hesitate to book this resort. But if you are traveling with teens or tweens, or a couple looking forward to a spa pool, pardon my french, teens or adults would not be caught dead in this so called swimming pool! It is really a toddler play pool. Perfect for that, but not for adults wishing to swim or unwind or anyone with kids older than 7 I would say. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! We are from the north so swimming was one of our main reasons for booking this vaca, obviously we don't get to swim up here in the Notheast in the winter so we arrived w/swimsuits in tow looking forward to getting a dip and R&Ring by the pool (from our previous experience at the All Star Movies when our son was younger, we assumed all pools would be large and inviting like their many pools.) The literature you receive upon check in or advice from the front desk about this situation was, \"Well you can use the pools at Riverside \"next door\"- let's be clear: Riverside/\"next door\" is a MILE WALK! Who wants to walk a mile to go swimming or come back sopping wet over a mile? Even if you took the bus over there, who would want to ride a bus in their swimsuit or back sopping wet on the bus? Even so, Port Orleans Riverside \"pools\" are characterized as \"swimming holes\" spread all over their property so not exactly like we'd be walking over to the disney beach club beach...so NOT WORTH IT! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY w/TWEENS/TEENS or couples looking fro a romantic spa/pool! if anyone plans on swimming. Otherwise, the layout was fine, the grounds were lovely, the food court had a decent amt of themed food, beignets highly recc; ribs/dirty rice/chicken, along w/ typical pizza/mac n cheese/chicken fingers for finicky kids plus sweets/bakery. All good/fine but not great and of course, expensive. Burger was typical frozen amusement type park food. My son said his ribs & dirty rice were good. we paid $30 dinner for three no desserts. Our meal at Liberty Tree Tavern (Magic Kingdom) on the other hand was AMAZING, best kept dining secret. Def try to go there for luch, get res. if u can. My husband's bacon burger was out of this world, I get the Patriot's (Turkey dinner) always good, pot roast good. Traditional colonial amercian fare but high quality. We always reserve here and never disappointed. HINT: book for LUNCH as dinner menu is prix fixe turkey dinner only and costs more. Lunch menu is the one w/widest offerings. And amazing desserts! Martha's Choc Cake w/coffee frosting and Some kind of Apple Dessert w/caramel and cranberries served warm, OMG! Best dessert I have ever eaten! Overall, Resort is Lovely; main check in bldg has check in, food court, fountains, live music some nights, sep bar, gift shop w/post office & groceries (milk/cereal etc so handy to keep in room for bfast to save $). (You can also find a WalMart close by etc to purchase lunchmeats breads etc to pack lunches etc so save more.) POOL A PROBLEM for tweens/teens/couples; but if you are here w/toddlers or under 7 crowd ok. Be prepared to walk, can be a distance from main building where the bus stop is. Bus service was excellent tho. We ended up leaving 2 days early due to lack of pool. We had planned time at the parks, did those then had figured we'd R&R by the pool then found out there was none appropriate for our family. Total waste for our/teen family. Should've stayed at AS Music or a some other hotel w better pool access. Not worth the upgrade for us. AS Music similar theme but better pool facilities for teens/tweens. Food not much better/diff. Rooms a little smaller in AS, no sep dressing area and dbl beds vs Q. See my ROOM TIPS to choose a bldg that is appropriate for you. They also have a luggage hold area in the main bldg which I think is for is you arrive early you can stow your luggage till check in time and conversely you can stow on check out day to pick up later. ALSO, do NOT get PARK HOPPER TIX: we spent over 1.5-2 hrs \"hopping\" between parks (this is Disney's official disclaimer time as well); the transporatation system is a joke/way overcrowded. You take a monorail to get to the main monorail hub (where you can also choose the riverboat,supposedly faster to MK) to get between parkss. At each stop, there is a 45-hour queue so you end up waiting for the first trans, then getting in line again for the next trans, then finally getting to your destination/other park like TWO HOURS later!!! miserable waits out in the hot sun as well . We've been to Disney 20 or more times; just get the single day park passes and focus on/stay in one park for the day so as not to waste hrs trsansferring btwn parks, there are enough lines in each park you will have to wait in/waste time anyway thruout the day just as normal part of DW (try to take advantage of fastpass at least, at opening, run to the most popular ride first in the park and get a fast pass at the kiosk u need your admission cards to get them and ride them right away) if u wait, you'll end up w 8 pm ride times) and ride them first, you can bang around the park for shopping & less serious rides later. Take advantage of Magic Hours if u can, espec the morning ones to get there early and get to those pop rides; divide and conquer, get in those pop ride lines fast (Soarin & test track at Epcot; Space Mtn, Buzz, etc at MK) then have one party/parent take your tickets to the fast pass kiosk while ur waiting in line & print u fast passes for later. generally, you get a one to two hour ride again altho if u arrive at the rides late, it can be up to 8 at night.

We flew down and utilized the free bus transportation from the airport and was slightly concerned about our luggage arriving in our rooms but some of it was there before we finished check-in. Check-in was a breeze (though there were only 2 people working and the visitors before us seemed to have a lot of questions so that took a little extra time). There were 11 people in our party so we reserved 3 standard rooms but we were upgraded to \"riverview\" rooms which was very nice. We were on the 3rd floor of bldg 6 and 2 of the rooms were directly across from each other and the 3rd was just a few doors down. We had 2 children in our party ages 3 and 8 they loved the nightly marshmallow roast and the nightly Disney movie shown on the lawn. The pools were great and fairly warm for December. The food court was nice and the food was great, especially the deserts baked fresh in the bakery. The size was great and the resort was so quiet. When you got off the bus people would head in different directions and then seem to disappear and you almost felt like you had the hotel to yourself. The only time our bus went through Riverside was one afternoon when we headed to miniature golf at Blizzard Beach and there were a few people headed to Animal Kingdom but I think the only reason they went through Riverside was because the bus was so empty. One other time we went to one stop but when the bus was full with people standing we headed off to the park. They have transportation people at each hotel and parks that can re-direct buses as needed. We have alreay recommended this hotel to friends planning a trip.

Myself and my husband went to Port Orleans FQ on 10 December 2011 for 1 week. Whilst it was some time ago, my memory of the hotel shall remain with me for my life. We were in Block 3 in a standard room. Check in was seamless and very 'Disney' but in a good way! Our room from the moment we entered became the most comfortable 'at home' experience myself and my husband have ever felt (and we have been to quite a few hotel) not only was the room spotless, it was cosy, well presented and very comfortable. MouseKeeping were brilliant and our room was cleaned to perfection every day. I cannot comment on the swimming pool (bit too chilly even for an English woman!) but the grounds were amazing, the attention to detail (which I appreciate is Disney) was wonderful from the 'old world' street lamps to the cobbled streets. We went whilst all the Christmas Decorations were up, how utterly magical. We found ourselves wandering around in awe at the sheer colour spectrum they used and what a great effect it was. The Disney Shop at the hotel had a great selection of goods including Star Wars Vinylmation which I never thought two 39 year olds could get excited about...But we did! We didn't eat at the hotel, but the bar, whilst quite small was enjoyable and very friendly. The reason it is nearly the end of February and I have only just written the review, is because we are booking to go back to Port Orleans FQ in September this year. I cannot recommend this hotel enough.

We have stayed at Wilderness, Contemporary, Animal Kingdom, Boardwalk, Riverside, and now the French Quarter. Let me say the difference between the \"Deluxe\" and \"Moderate\" resorts is HUGE. We loved the Deluxe Hotels and enjoyed spending time at the resort whether it was swimming, exploring, or just relaxing. The Deluxe Hotels are part of the experience. Now, as my kids have gotten a little older, we go to the parks in the morning and have been coming back late...so, I haven't felt like spending the money on the good hotels. And the French Quarter is a decent place to sleep after a long day at the park. The doors open to the outside like a hotel off the interstate. Our room was clean and decorated well. The rooms are fairly small. The beds are OK but, certainly not great. The TV selection stinks. Disney has about 50 channels and 20 or more are Disney Infomercial type channels. So, when you get back to the room and put the kids to sleep and you want to watch a little TV, the choices (channels) STINK! Now, the grounds are beautiful. The pool is nice although we didn't take the time to swim in it. So, to sum it up. The French Quarter is a decent hotel on Disney's property. If you are going to go to the parks in the morning and not come back until fairly late the French Quarter is an average place to sleep at. It is not going to wow you, but will give you the benefits of staying on Disney property like Disney Transportation and the Disney Dining Plan.

The safe had no key so the first day we had no safe until they took a part out and made a new key for it. Our recent stay at this hotel we were given one very small conditioner/shampoo combo and 2 small soaps. The large wooden furniture is gone. The amenities are the same as you would receive in a motel 6...... We were in room 5135. This is the first floor.This room is next to the grass area. DO NOT stay in this room if you plan on sleeping much. At 1 AM we were awaken by very loud guests laughing and playing on the grass. The staff does nothing to quiet guests down. Finally a man opened his door and yelled at the loud people who played for another 20 minutes before finally being quiet. On Saturday nights they have a very loud movie on the greens. The hotel is big enough that you need not ever be near these rooms so ask. The pool looks nice but when we finally had a free minute we were told it was closed and we could walk to the hotel next store if we wanted to swim. Only a 10 minute walk they kept saying.... This trip we did not try the buses since we know how slow they are . We were told by another guest that it took them from 9AM-10:20 to arrive at magic kingdom on the bus!!!! Disney has combined many resorts on the same bus route. In the past all resorts had their own bus. The reason to stay in a Disney hotel would be: You need the transportation and have lots of time to waste. You want to do the magic hours in the park.

We picked French Quarter as it has good reviews and the same number of buses as riverside but less people guaranteeing less crowded transport. The rooms were good and clean, and in fact the rooms are identical to Coronado except the bathroom separator was a curtain instead of solid wood doors. Free wi-fi works well and the service was reasonable - an AC problem was fixed right away, but it overall it wasn't up to previous trips. Our only request, a ground floor, was ignored, we wound up on the top floor. They forgot my wife's birthday on check-in and Fulton's Crab House forgot it as well along with the cake I ordered. (Note most of the Downtown Disney Restaurants are now on the dining plan but are still working out the kinks). We ordered a river view room and got a bit of a surprise. The \"river\" is a 200ft wide blackish green body of water for the water taxis - not really much of a view. Water taxi's ply it every 20 minutes in each direction, every 10 after 4pm till 11pm. That's an average of a boat every 5 minutes past your door and each boat repeatedly honks an air horn pulling in and out of the dock, so picture a sports fan in a lawn chair with an aerosol can air horn honking and yelling at your room every 5 minutes. Imagine the tone of your wife turning to you 15 minutes after check-in and saying \"REALLY?\" upon hearing the 3rd horn go off. If you get the pool as your view, you should know they set up a DJ booth and speaker system for loud music and kids games at 2 and 3pm so if you afternoon nap your kids this could be an issue. For the $25 a day extra the water view room costs you could get a park hopper or water park/golf add-on for the family instead and not miss a thing. We skipped the Magic Express again (see my Coronado review) and went for the $100 limo including a grocery trip. Tried Payless Transportation this time instead of Tiffany and won't make that mistake ever again. Tiffany picks you up in a town car when you book a town car. Payless - also booked as a town car service - picked us up in a Ford Expedition and returned for us (late) in a dented green panel van we were embarrassed to climb into. So overall, in point form: - Rooms are good and clean and free wi-fi works good. - Don't get water or river view - Service is okay but remind them repeatedly of special occasions - Watch your dining plan credits after using downtown Disney restaurants - House of Blues charged us once at dinner and once again the next morning (between meals so it was hard to detect) and the only way we avoided a truly embarrassing conversation at a character breakfast was by watching the bottom of the receipts, noticing multiple credits disappeared and getting the mistake fixed at the front desk. The people at the restaurants cannot help you. - Hollywood and Vine is the best character breakfast by far and we've done them all. - The Toy Story Mania ride is awesome and always full and the fast pass closes (full) before noon on any day. Book an 8am Hollywood & Vine character breakfast to get into the park an hour early. Send the family to the restaurant and walk immediately to the fast pass machine (back of park) to get fast passes which even by then will be after 9am, then go have breakfast. When you get out of breakfast go ride - and notice that the fast pass times are now near 5pm. - Try not to book meals at other resorts (ie.Boma, Jiko, Narcoosees etc) unless you don't mind the full hour transit time because you have to go to a park then get the resort specific bus back to where your meal is. We found buses took a little longer from this resort since it was off the highway system by a road or two. Note MK water ferries don't operate in the morning in time to get early breakfasts. - Some parks (Hollywood for one) offer transport to other parks directly so they can be used as transport hubs. - Want friends in the area to join you in the pool? Have them park free at DD and take the free boat to the French Quarter that lets off 200 ft from the pool next to the Dragon Slide. - For photos and recreation schedules etc, see www.portorleans.org", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston, GA", "Title": "\u201cMagic is gone from this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Noble_Scribe", "ReviewID": "UR124781120", "Content": "First, let me say that most of our poor impression of this hotel was probably owed more to the guests than the staff. Still, so that people will understand clearly what they\u2019re in store for, I will endeavor to write candidly of the experience. We stayed here in mid-February, what had been described as the \u201clast week of the off season.\u201d But if this was the off season, I\u2019d hate to see the busy times. It was a family trip, with our 3-year-old daughter, my wife, and my wife\u2019s parents. Check-in was smooth. The front-desk staff weren\u2019t terribly welcoming, rehashing the same spiel about meal plans, check-out options, what the room key/park ticket did, etc. like they\u2019d done it a thousand times that day. We arrived on the heels of a Disney Express bus bringing a load of people from the airport, so the lobby was crowded and we had to wait behind the bus people. That was the story of the trip, come to think of it \u2013 fighting through semi-organized crowds. After fighting through the bus people to check in, we found that our connecting rooms were not that at all. They offered to let us stay a night, pack up our stuff again, become nomads from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and then relocate to another pair of rooms elsewhere in the resort to have connecting rooms. We decided instead that we\u2019d deal with the separate rooms, which were at least adjacent, and would just shuttle our 3-year-old back and forth between our room and her grandparents\u2019 as she wanted to visit. Then, we discovered that the buses from the hotel to the parks were incredibly crowded with the most obnoxious class of people. Regardless of how long you\u2019d been at the bus stop, the crowds were eager to push their way past you to board the buses and secure themselves a seat. The buses also pull through a series of about four stops at the adjacent resort \u2013 Port Orleans Riverside \u2013 which creates a special impediment if trying to make time to keep a dinner reservation at one of the parks. One particular group with which we had the most negative impression was a large group of teenage cheerleaders who were staying at the hotel for some type of competition. They all sought breakfast at the same time at the Sassagoula Boatworks and Food Factory at the hotel, which made it impossible for any other guests to dine there before hitting the parks. These girls broke in line, stepped in front of you, spent time socializing in front of soda fountains and bathrooms, bumped into you and your tray of food without apology or regard and generally created a terrible start to the day. While their behavior could not be regulated by the hotel, one wonders why Disney, with its immense resorts, would book a party so large at one of its smallest hotels. The dining facility was simply not able to accommodate so large a crowd and its family guests. More planning or organization on Port Orleans French Quarter\u2019s part, such as having these crowds dine earlier or later than the breakfast rush for other guests, would have been a vast improvement. (Although, honestly, the food wasn\u2019t that great anyway. Which made having to fight for it all the more of an insult.) Though the hotel offers ferries to Port Orleans Riverside and Downtown Disney, these turned out to be a bit of a joke. We promised our 3-year-old a boat ride and had intended to visit the toy store at Downtown Disney, and since the ferries departed from our hotel, it seemed sensible to take one as a convenience and an experience. Of course, we never expected to lose 45 minutes of our vacation to standing on a dock (couldn\u2019t provide benches for people, Port Orleans? Really?) waiting for the ferry to arrive. Once it did arrive, it loaded so many people on it that some, including yours truly, had no seat. Unlike the buses, you\u2019re not permitted to stand for ferry trips, so I had to ask people to please put their children in their laps and move over so that I wouldn\u2019t have to get off the boat and wait another half hour for another ride. THE GOOD The best thing we can say about the resort: the room was immaculate, the \u201cmousekeeping\u201d staff was first-rate and polite and the rooms were comfortable and reasonably well-appointed. The furniture was nice and was not worn, and the carpet was clean and lush, and the bathrooms were very clean and stain-free. THE BAD It goes without saying that Disney is going to have crowds, but the crowds at this place were exceptional in their rudeness, which Port Orleans French Quarter did not try at all to mitigate. The staff wasn\u2019t rude, but wasn\u2019t as exceedingly welcoming as one has come to expect from a Disney resort.

It came from too-powerful CFCs in all the fixtures, and lit up the place like an airport men's room. If you turn all the lights on, it's downright blinding. I guess Disney got a bulk discount or something, but since CFCs can't be dimmed, less powerful bulbs would be a major improvement--and save electricity, too.

Bus service was great - no long waits, transportation time to parks was quick, no overcrowding, only shared bus with Riverside on the return journey from the parks, not to the parks in the morning. Buses were only overcrowded once on return from Magic Kingdom Wishes fireworks at park closing so that's only to be expected. Bus drivers were great and friendly. Boat to downtown disney as relaxing as I remembered it although a little busier as one boat is now shared between two hotels. Since last visit an added value - Movies on the green at 7 pm every night. This is a chance to watch a different disney movie each night sitting outside on the lawn, towels are provided to sit on, a great way to relax after a busy park day with a tired 6 year old. The rooms have been renovated and now have two queen beds (King sized in the UK) Decor was clean and nice with two hidden Mickeys. I like this resort because it is one of the smaller Disney resorts, it doesn't really matter which block you get allocated because none of them are a huge distance from the facilities, you don't have to pay for a preferred room. Food court is great - try the fried chicken and corn bread - my favourite. Only negatives are they no longer provide Kids life jackets for free at the pool but you can rent them and they were doing renovations to the lobby when we stayed but they've got to do it sometime to keep the hotel looking so nice. The gardens of this resort are special, the planting is lovely you can just sit on a bench and relax, the gardens even smell good. The walk to the sister hotel Riverside is a maximum of 10 minutes a way, a gentle stroll down the river if you want to try bigger facilities. The pool at French Quarter was excellent, many life guards constantly patrolling which makes you feel safe. Also note that there's free Wifi access in rooms - this does not seem to be widely advertised.

Well, it was another WONDERFUL stay. The hotel is everything we had hoped it would be and more. Even though there were a few facelifts happening during our stay, the property is just beautiful, very calm and quiet. The ferry that will take you to the Riverside side of the hotel or to Downtown Disney is a great convenience, although I DO recommend doing the walk to Riverside at least once along the waterway. The ferry's comes often and it gives a new perspective when you arrive at Downtown Disney by water. The food court is great, the food is very nice and the only disappointing thing that I experienced was finding out that they have changed their policy on redeeming leftover quick service meals for snacks. We had a bunch left and they would NOT let us take a muffin in place of a Quick Service. This didn't make sense since you could take the muffins as part of the Quick Service meal...The pool is lots of fun for the kids with the slides and games that take place in the afternoon around the hotel.

We requested a room with a king which we got but we also got a room with a view of the \"river,\" which was on the back side of the resort and in our case furtherest from the pool and noise. This meant a further walk to the pool, restaurant and bus stop but we like to walk. The room was clean. It had a 2 sink vanity. A curtain can be drawn to divide the vanity space from the bed area. We liked this because it kept the room open but could be closed to keep light down for anyone still in bed. The shower/tub and toliet were separated with a door. There is no closet. Instead there is a rod along one side of the vanity area. Again not having a walled area with a door created more space to move around in. I thought the room was very spacious, but 2 queens would make it less so. We never waited more than 5 mintues for a bus. We went to Epcot and Animal Kingdom. We also took the Magic Kingdom bus from the airport. We found all the transportation very convenient. I doubt that January is a peak time for Disney so take that into account in considering this review. There is no monrail service at the Port Orleans resorts. One of our bus trips did take us through the Riverside resort and it seems to be much larger than the French Quarter so a lot more walking could be involved there? There is only one restaurant, Sassgoula, at the French Quarter. It had a good cafeteria style breakfast. We didn't eat there otherwise. You can take the bus to the other resorts or Kingdom's or take the boat to Downtown Disney for meals as well. We ate at several restaurants in Epcot and had lunch at one in Animal Kingdom. We also ate at a restaurant at Downtown Disney. They were all good to very good. We opted not to buy a Dining Plan. now that we know how much our meals at Disney cost, we know that the Dining Plan would have actually cost us money. I would look at this carefully before buying a plan. The meals in the Plan in general cover only an Entree, a dessert, and a nonalcohol drink.

We had three rooms and asked to be put in a quiet location. We were assigned to Building 1 on the top floor. To of our rooms were adjoining and the other room was right around the corner. We had rented a car so we found the location to be perfect. It was just a quick walk out to the car, but because the resort is so small it was also a short, but beautiful walk to the pool and main building as well. If you are using the buses exclusively you may want a closer building, but we didn't mind the walk to the bus stop either. We found the bus service to be very convenient and we always used the bus when traveling to the Magic Kingdom. The rooms are lovely and fairly spacious. We were traveling with four children (two of whom slept in my parent's room) but we kept all the clothes in our room and found that we had plenty of storage space. The fridge in the room is convenient if you want to stock it with milk and yogurt for quick and easy breakfasts. We thought the beds were quite comfortable, just a tad on the noisy side. We also had a knocking noise in the bathroom, but we couldn't hear it if we kept the bathroom door closed. The noise from the toilet flusing is quite loud as well. Still, we were pleased with the rooms overall and thought that they were clean and well maintained. The food court is adequate, but we didn't eat anything that really stood out. It's a quick and easy option if you're exhausted from being in the parks. I wished that we'd walked down to Riverside to try their food court for some variety. We loved the pool area. My boys are 8, 6, 3, and 1 and they all enjoyed the pool area. The slide is perfect for younger children since there is not an enclosed area. There's plenty of room for splashing and playing and also a lovely children's wading pool as well. We never had the chance to try out the hot tub, but it looked large. The boat to Downtown Disney is convenient and so relaxing. It's a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the parks. They run every 20 minutes during the day and then come every 10 minutes starting in the evening. We usually only go to Downtown Disney once during a trip, but this trip we went three times because the boat made it so convenient. Magical Express stops at Saratoga Springs and Old Key West before hitting the French Quarter. My husband and dad rented vehicles and made it to the resort before us, but just by about 10 minutes. At Christmas there are four beautiful Christmas trees in the courtyard off the lobby that are all aglow in the evening making it seem very welcoming. There was a short line for airline check-in on our departure day, but it does move slowly so go down to the lobby in plenty of time to get through the process. The French Quarter is a lovely resort and well suited for couples and families. The landscaping is beautiful and the resort is very quiet. We stayed at Pop the previous two years and thought that it was well worth the money to upgrade to the French Quarter. It's a more relaxed and has a much more secluded feel. We've also stayed at the Polynesian, but thought that the French Quarter was just as nice. If you're hesitating just give it a try!

The hotel is set around Jazz and Blues, it is huge and I believe we stayed at the better one suited for a family who likes to swim as the pool is lovely. We had to bribe the kids to get out. They have marshmellow evenings, cinema nights on the green where you grab a towel to sit on (it was quite chilly when we arrived which was a surprise to us, to take a warm light coat or thermal cardi (especially for kids) we hadn't taken anything and had to buy. Though it did warm up a few days later it was still cool on the evenings. The food is self service and the same, it is much like a canteen, my husband hated the plastic plates and cutlery, though you can see it cuts outs washing up, the waste is terrible. We had missed the dinning plans so had to pay, it is on a par with English dining it was cheaper to buy the plastic refillable cups though as you could fill them with hot or cold drinks through the day (only at the hotel), they do leak so dont rely on them for not leaking all over your things. The room was great we were in 6032 and i had a vision that it would be very cramped with the bathroom and toilet area on show. it was huge with 2 king size beds, a TV, room for 4 cases (take hangers never enough), room service was every day and they were lovely. The whole staff there were very pleasant and helpful, infact every where! If you are like we were and totally new to Florida we hadn't a clue and were guided by a couple of friends who had been. We hired a car as we had booked to go to Sea Life (worth a trip if got time) and Kennedy Space Center (which was also good if got time) I have to say fitting these in were a rush and we didn't really need them, the parks are vast for firt time visits. If you are on a schedule and can get around quickly (I have walking difficulties), like to get up very early to catch the shows and early hours (which are open at different times for different parks) you would probably fit extra in. We enjoyed what we did at our pace even fitting 3 Days out of 14 around the pool. It is not a relaxing, by the pool holiday, but it is fun and exhilarating and not just for children.We had a Fabulous Time at the parks. In hindsight we didn't need the 2 extra trips or the car so could have saved the money, we would probably go again in a couple of years time as they are developing again and just do the parks. It is worth having the dining plan if you can get it, and I think you can book direct with the hotel if not offered via the travel agent to pay before you go though a couple of weeks before. SOME NOTES: Themed Restuarants are great, however book in advance to get what you want, we couldn't get in to the castle as we didnt know there was a 3-6 month waiting list, we did get to meet Cinderella, Prince Charming, the ugly sisters and mother dear at the Floridian (wow what a place, not for children too pristine hehe) our resort got us in there and we had to pay, it is on a rotary basis so get you meal whilst waiting for them to come round. Our kids were awe struck as it was a total surprise. 2) Do the Pirate Day at Disney World, it is expensive to have every thing though you can take your own costums, they do your face and take you through a special place, great fun the kids loved it and it took a good hour and half. 3) No food into the parks, they check bags and are rigorous. 4) Take water capes as the flume is well worth going on, so much fun. 5) You dont have to tip the camera people. 6) Read the plans to know what time the star people are about my daughter lover peter pan and he was there.

A wonderful experience!\u201d", "Author": "darcysmile", "ReviewID": "UR123259283", "Content": "Alright, I'm a Disney geek and I've bounced around trying out several different resorts on WDW properties in the \"Value\" and \"Moderate\" categories. This one, though? Hands down the winner. If you're looking to balance the best of everything, I think you'll like French Quarter, too. Here's why it's the best ... * Size ... it's HALF the size of the Riverside resort, so no matter where your room is, it won't be a long walk. * Layout ... it's laid out in little perpendicular \"streets\", which makes it really easy to get around and find everything. * Rooms ... they JUST renovated every room in the resort. They all have brand new QUEEN sized beds, and the new decor is really lovely, classy (I didn't care for the previous decor - it was kind of \"loud\"). * Pool ... this one has a proper waterslide, and awesome themeing throughout the pool area. If you're traveling with kids who plan to swim, be sure to compare the pools. * Value ... although this is in the \"moderate\" resort category, and value resorts will run a little less, there are some drawbacks to the value resorts. They're located out by the main highway, they're HUGE (so walking from your room to transportation can take a while) and typically the transportation seems to be a little further away, more crowded and run less often. At least, that's what I experienced. THIS \"moderate\" resort is a step up, but not a hugely expensive one. Worth the slight increase, in my opinion. * Quiet, and NOT a destination ... by this I mean, if you stay at one of the \"Deluxe\" resorts - such as the Polynesian or the Grand Floridian, etc - you're at a destination that guests of other resorts will be traveling to for dinners, shows, etc. It can make those resorts feel pretty crowded and busy. The nice thing about French Quarter is that it is not a destination for anyone other than the actual hotel guests. There's a dining hall on property, and a steakhouse in P.O. Riverside (you can walk to it), but there's no restaurant on the actual FQ property. This means the only people at FQ are FQ guests. After a busy day in the parks, I like to come \"home\" to a resort that's relaxed. It was nice and quiet ... At least, it was quiet when we were there, and I was told they were nearly full, so that's a good sign. They had jazz Christmas music playing at all times, but the level was just perfect. Just loud enough to be heard, and not so loud that it was disruptive or annoying. You'd see people around, but it never felt \"busy\". * Proximity ... We like Epcot the best, and this resort is in the Epcot area. However, it's also just down the river from Downtown Disney, and has its own dock to a boat ride you can take there and back. Kind of a nice bonus. Speaking of which - ask for a room by the river. It's SO nice and peaceful out there in the morning. * The Doorman ... I have to give credit to the doorman who dressed up in fabulous purples and greens with feathered plumes and passed out beads and coins throughout the day. It was one of those little touches that made a big difference. He was a favorite part of the trip for my daughter, and she looked forward to seeing him every day.

It's location is perfect.. not too far from the major theme parks (save AK) and is very close Downtown Disney which is just a short relaxing boat ride away. One of the major pulls to this resort is it's size.. it truly is quaint and small so no matter where you're room is you aren't more than a 5 minute walk away from anything. Another plus is that given its such a small resort there is only a single bus depot. That's a major draw if you've ever stayed at one of the larger moderate resorts w/ mulitple bus stops or worse.. had to take a place in the cattle line at the value level. The pool is fun themed, if you prefer to just bathe in the sun you can do that while taking in the serenity of the Sassagoula river. Ok, so the food court is amazing.. but it isn't terrible either. If you book thru Disney (we always do) then you can opt to purchase a dining plan and then, eat someplace else. Personally the food court wasn't much of a bother since we rarely ate there.. but it seemed to please the young palets. All in all, the is the BEST resort (of the moderates) on Disney's property. One downside(hardly worth mentioning): remember I said there was only 1 bus depot? Well that's certainly a plus when you're ready to head off into the parks, but sometimes the bus is shared with the other side of the resrot (Riverside) and that can add a few minutes delay in arrival or.. when leaving the parks.. a long line if there's isn't a line specified for FQ.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cConvenient , but don't plan on sleeping\u201d", "Author": "Orange B", "ReviewID": "UR122931676", "Content": "Stayed at Port Orleans French Quarter for the Disney Marathon.

The room was spotless, and had obviously been updated. The cleaning staff were very efficient and pleasant. As a matter of fact, all of the staff at Disney World are pleasant--that is part of why we enjoy going there. French Quarter is a quieter, more romantic Disney resort in its architecture, and layout. Also, if you like to walk, you will enjoy walking along the paved walkway from French Quarter to Riverside, its sister resort in Port Orleans. The walkway borders the river and provides one of the most scenic walking areas (in our opinion) in the Park. For those who like to go to Downtown Disney, it is an easy, relaxing, and enjoyable boat ride to Downtown Disney. Boats run all day and well into the evening. The cafeteria restaurant is fine for quick meals or snacks. One tip: explore the other resorts, such as Old Key West, Polynesian, Animal Kingdom Lodge. It is easy to ride the free Disney transportation to these other Disney resorts, eat in their restaurants, and admire their grounds. Then you can return to your reasonably priced, quiet accommodations at French Quarter for the night. One caveat: if your room faces the river, you will occasionally hear the boat horns--the boat captains are required to blow the horn when approaching and leaving the dock.

Making the decision to say at Port Orleans was based on price, comfort, a friend's recommendation and location. First, I would like to say that the grounds of the Port Orleans Resort is impeccable, bringing to mind Southern charm. Upon reaching our hotel room I was dismayed at the small size of the room. As a family of four we had a double room which was tiny. It really didn't seem up to par with the whole Disney image. Port Orleans is described as a mid-price hotel and is priced accordingly. Frankly, I thought the price was too high for such a teeny room. By the end of the week we were sick of being in each other's way since the room had no space for anything other than sleeping. On the positive side we greatly enjoyed the pool area - it was fun, whimsical and entertaining for the children. The slides in the pool are awesome! With regards to food on the property, I found it reasonably priced and accessible. It is well worth the price of buying the all purpose cup which allows you to have drinks for your entire stay. Meal plans are also available, but we did not choose this option since we wanted to sample restaurants in the Orlando area. The best part of staying at Port Orleans was the proximity to Disney, the buses that took us quickly and frequently to Disney locations and the perks we received for extra park hours due to us staying on Disney property. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with our room (way too small) but I felt that it was overall a decent stay.

I could see older kids maybe feeling that they had outgrown it, but I even went down the slide and it was fun. The room was small but very nice. It was refurbished with new queen beds. For the small size, it was well thought out: hooks for coats on the wall, shelves under the double sinks for storing clothes/shoes, a marble shelf above the sinks to keep the clutter off the counter. There was also a curtain to divide the bedroom from the vanity area. The actual tub/shower area is really small. There is a table and chairs and small refrigerator for breakfast in the room. There is a water shuttle from the back of the hotel that takes you to Downtown Disney, which was great. I did not like that there were no balconies off the room other than going outside.

Out of them all, this one is the best bang for the buck, isn't overly Disney-fied, and is the most centrally located. It's French Quarter charm and small alleys make it just expansive enough to not feel like you're on top of one another but everything is well within a short 5 minute walk. Most of the rooms have been updated to have an even more distinguished look and feel, flat screen TVs with working remotes, small refrigerators in the rooms are now standard equipment, and the heat/air conditioning is now a quiet under window unit with a wall-mounted thermostat as opposed to the old and loud multi-function units that never maintained a steady temperature. Disney buses are frequent and rarely standing room only. The Sassagoula River snakes through the property providing a soundtrack at night while walking along the footpath and also sports a ferry to take you either to Riverside or Downtown Disney. If you have a car, they have ample parking and you're situated in a spot that is easily accessible to Disney Studios, Disney's Boardwalk, EPCOT, Downtown Disney and Magic Kingdom. But even perfection has its flaws: When it first opened it had a wonderful restaurant called Bonfamille's, but that was removed in favor of a counter service offering. The only sit-down restaurant now is at French Quarter's sister resort, Riverside, which only serves dinner. Water pressure in the rooms is practically non-existent and the showerheads usually spray water in every direction other than towards you. If you're in one of the interior buildings along the Sassagoula River, be prepared for a walk to get to/from the parking lot and bus stop. There is only one bus stop for French Quarter, right outside of the main building, whereas other similarly laid out hotels have multiple bus stops. No business center for guests to utilize a computer and a printer or at the very least, an internet-ready kiosk with built-in printer so guests can do online check-ins for their flights. The airline check-in desk in Disney hotels is operated by Orlando Airport staff just to take care of checked luggage. This service does not allow you to check-in and get boarding passes for your flight. Few benches adorn the footpath along the Sassagoula River to allow guests to sit and just enjoy the scenery. The general store, though well-stocked, is small in comparison to other resorts. Why they never moved it to the old Bonfamille's area and expanded it is beyond me. The current location would be better served as a larger gift shop that also housed the gaudy Disney Vacation Club desk which resides adjacent to the registration counter. Smoking areas are located close to regularly traveled walkways and egresses. The one directly outside of Sassagoula Floatworks should be removed completely as it is no more than 12 feet from the outside tables. They no longer offer half and half in the beverage area. Your only option is tiny Coffeemate creamers. This is the only resort that stopped offering half and half and the reason for it? \"We tried it, but it wasn't working out\" is what I was told by a cast member. Yeah, it didn't make sense to us either. Coffee in most hotels is mass produced Nescafe...it's not even their \"Mickey's Coffee\" that's sold in their gift shops. There are only 2 coffeeshops that brew fresh coffee in Disney hotels. One is found at Kona Cafe in the Polynesian...but get there early because they close at 11am and it changes into a sushi bar!

The kids loved getting beads and the coins from the lovely gentleman at the front door to make wishes in the fountain. The bus service was great. We rarely shared a bus with Riverside and when we did we were the first ones on and first ones off. My only complaint would be the food. Even my 4 year old wouldn't eat their hot breakfast and he loves basically any type of breakfast food. There is much room for improvement in that area. We had a lot of oatmeal, cereal and fruit for breakfast, which is fine, but can get old. Overall, if we stayed on Disney property again, this would be my first pick for what it offered. I couldn't justify going Deluxe unless we got a huge discount.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hoboken, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cPort Orleans= Great Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "preciosa919", "ReviewID": "UR122331229", "Content": "We stayed here for a week in early November.

Two other big pros to staying in a Moderate Resort (at least this one), is less crowding at the bus and transportation sights than you get with the Value Resorts (we almost always got a seat), and the special deal sometimes offered where you get a FREE meal plan when you stay at a Moderate (which we took advantage of and highly recommend!!).

We had checked in from home, so all we had to do was pick up our registration package (and our Happy Anniversary buttons).

Our room was 5233, which was a great location - not far from the bus stop and the food court and the hot tub. The room is small, but we didn\u2019t spend much time there. It looked like it had been renovated recently. The grounds around the resort were beautiful and immaculate. This was a great time of year to go - decent weather and not very crowded. One day at the Magic Kingdom, we walked onto every attraction - no lines at all. We only used Fast Pass one time, and that was for Buzz Lightyear\u2019s Space Ranger Spin at Hollywood Studios. Every employee on every bus and at every attraction and restaurant was extremely polite. Disney employees are always the epitome of great customer service. If there was anything negative, it would be that there are too many people on cell phones all the time and also texting (not watching where they are going) and people wearing entirely too much perfume.

VERY HAPPY WITH OUR STAY!!\u201d", "Author": "Momof3kidzz", "ReviewID": "UR122199923", "Content": "We stayed at Disney's Port Orleans French Quarter Resort from December 17 through December 22. We are a family of 5; Dad, Mom, two adult children & one 13 year old. We requested adjoining rooms and our request was honored. We checked in around 11:00 a.m. and much to our surprise our rooms were ready. We were lucky to be assigned in building 3 without paying the upgrade. This building is soooo close to the food court, bus stop, etc. We stayed at the Disney's All Star Music 2 years ago; Disney's Port Orleans Riverside last year. By far this resort exceeded our expectations. The other two resorts were nice; of course, Riverside nicer than All Star (mainly because of the room size) but French Quarter is such a small resort that after a long day at the parks there is not a long walk back to your room. Even the farthest building is not a long walk. Riverside is just such a huge resort; it's beautiful but for us, we prefer a much smaller one. One thing I'm very picky about is how clean the rooms are. These were just renovated and I'm not even sure if our room had been used. There was some dust on the shelf in the dressing area but other than that, everything was extremely clean. Mousekeeping always gave clean towels everyday, made the beds, etc. We only had towel animals one day which was a little disappointing but they are very busy. We were on the second floor and the only sound we heard were the toilets flushing once in a great while from other rooms. We never heard talking, walking, etc. The beds were extremely comfortable and were queen size. Very nice upgrade from the full size we've had in the past. The food in the food court was great; but we aren't picky eaters. The dining plan is an absolute must. Honestly, the quick service for both meals is plenty of food. It just depends on what you prefer. We had one table service per day and honestly, we never had a bad meal. If you have reservations, you just need to make sure you allow plenty of time to get to your destination. It took us a little over an hour to get to Chef Mickey's from our hotel using the bus system. The bus system - the only complaint I ever have and it's a minor one. Sometimes they came quickly sometimes they didn't. Sometimes we picked up Riverside at all 4 of their bus stops and sometimes we didn't. It was hard to figure out how much time to allow to get to our reservations sometimes. On the upside, we were always first on and first off. So, we always had a seat. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone and we will be staying here when we go back. Everyone we encountered was very nice. My daughter actually left her wallet on a bus back from Downtown Disney and the driver actually found it; nothing had been touched in it. Where else would that happen. We ate at the food court once for breakfast - it was great. We ate their for our lunch on our way out - it was great, too. I absolutely recommend the Backlot quick service restaurant at Hollywood Studios if you get the chance. It's always fantastic. We also ate at the 1900 Park Fair for breakfast; never disappoints. The Crystal Palace was okay - not fantastic. Coral Reef was very good at Epcot. Chef Mickey's was awesome. And, as always, Le Chef De France at Epcot was outstanding.

We finally decided to go to Disney World and opted for Port Orleans French Quarters for a 12 night stay - We were not disapointed!! The lovely river that wrapped part of the resort grounds set a peacful atmosphere, as did the multitude of trees and the rabbit that would come to the park area almost every night. Our room was clean and had a nice \"mickey\" on the bed made out of towels when we got to our room. We had a king sized bed with a view of the river...and we have no regrets!! The gorgeous view allowed us to relax after long days at the parks. The double sinks were nice, and we liked that the bathroom/shower area was separate than the sink area, and we also liked that there was a curtain that separated the sinks from the bedroom. We liked that this resort was smaller, making it easy to get around and it did not leave you with a 15 minute walk to your room when you got back from the parks - it was great! The restaurant and pool were very child oriented, but when in Disney, it is expected. We had a ton of fun in the pool (not too crowded compared to other resorts) and as for the restaurant, if we weren't in the mood, we simply picked up our food and brought it to our room where we could enjoy the absolutely delicious food while enjoying our wonderful view. The decor is great and makes you want to stroll around the grounds and appreciate life. The bus system was hit or miss, but for the most part, we found that we didn't have to wait much more than 20 minutes on average, which compared to the other resorts on the Disney grounds, was great. Our resort's buses weren't as crowded as the ones for the other resorts, which was also an added bonus to having chosen a smaller resort. One of the best things was that we could also take a boat to Downtown Disney instead of taking a bus, which was romantic, fun and different. The wait for a boat was not as long as the wait for the bus, but the transit time was a bit longer, but well worth it. Finally, there are 7 buildings on the resort that contain the guest rooms (we were in building 5, on the far side of the pool). You can choose your view as well as your location (far away for isolation and privacy or near the lobby/restaurant/gift shop/pool). You can also enjoy the nice trails and you can also enjoy the neighboring resort, Port Orleans Riverside. Port Orleans French Quarters delivers on it's promises - If you choose this resort, you will not be disapointed!

The hotel was clean and building 3 was in a good location. However, the service is not up to Disney standards. I will give a few examples. When returning to my room one day, the cleaning lady was not done with my room and told me I could not go in. I would have expected her to phrase it a little different but since she could not speak English I assume that is why she was so abrupt. Another example which is what made me write a review was when we stored our bags and my daughters\u2019 balloons. They told me that they store balloons all the time so it would be no problem however when we returned to get the bags and balloons I noticed one of the outer balloons of the Disney ear style balloons was popped.

My 3 year old daughter began to cry when she saw the balloon so I did not have time to deal with him. Once I was able to calm my daughter down I entered the hotel to let the concierge know so that they could update the manager so no other child would be disappointed on their last day at Disney. The concierge did not seem to care about this and I am sure they did not update the manager. I was not requesting anything special but a sincere apology which was never given by any of the Disney staff.

The GOOD: The re-creation of the French Quarter look is great. It's like being in the heart of New Orleans without the drunkeness or the dirty streets. The staff were friendly and helpful as well. The BAD: We checked in to the hotel in the morning to pick up our Keys to the World then headed to the Magic Kingdom. We were told at check-in that we would get a text or call when our room was ready including the room number so we wouldn't have to go back to the desk when we returned from the park. Finally we decided that even though we hadn't been notified our room must surely be ready. When we got back to the hotel we had to wait in line at the check-in desk to find out our room number since they had never called or texted us with the information. Inconvenient but not unbearable. The UGLY: Hollywood Studios was the park with extended hours that night which was the whole reason we chose that night to go to Disney. (The Osbourne Family light show was INCREDIBLE!!!) You'd think that since so many people would be heading to Hollywood Studios there would have been plenty of buses going to that park from the hotel. We got to the bus stop and waited. And waited and waited and waited. After 45 minutes a bus finally came but was full and could only fit 2 people even though there were more than a bus load of people waiting. The bus pulled up behind a Magic Kingdom bus that was letting a traveler in a wheelchar off so 2 people from the back of the line got on instead of the people at the front who had been waiting the longest. By this point a riot was about to break out because there were a number of people who wanted to get to Hollywood Studios in time for a show that they were now in danger of missing. After we were there an hour (some people had been there even longer) people who had been waiting a long time started calling the hotel to complain. Finally an hour and 15 minutes after we got to the bus stop, a bus to Hollywood Studios showed up. Unfortunately by the time we got to the park and got oriented most of the food places were closing so we wasted a lot of the time we had left in the park trying to find a place to eat dinner. The whole reason we stayed at a Disney hotel was to get the Fast Passes and the transportation. We missed rides we wanted to go on because they ran out of Fast Passes (Big Thunder Mountain Railroad at the Magic Kingdom was the biggest disappointment in that regard) and we didn't get to do everything we wanted at Hollywood Studios because of the transportation. Now I realize the holidays are incredibly busy at Disney but you'd think they'd be prepared for the onslaught and at least have enough transportation.

This review might be fairly similar to the review posted in May of 2009. Basic Overview: Port Orleans French Quarter is designed to look like New Orleans....having never been there, I don't know how well they succeeded. It is a nice and unique looking hotel though. All rooms are accessed from outside, which I always thought was the difference between a hotel and motel....oh well. For the most part, the grounds were very nice and well kept. They were doing a bit of construction on the walkways outside of our room though. And they started around 8am, so that was a bit annoying. Everything was very clean. There is a walking path that leads to the Riverside hotel. The Room: We had a king size bed. The mattress was a little hard and creeky, but I've had worse. The pillows however were (still) the worst I've ever had in a hotel/motel....they were hard as rocks and extremely high. I learned my lesson from our first stay and brought my own pillow from home. The shower was pretty standard, with a slightly above average sized tub. The powder room is separated via a curtain and had 2 separate sinks and mirrors which was nice. The room had enough drawer space, medium sized flat screen TV, and a mini fridge. One odd issue with the rooms in this hotel is the toilet. They flush with the power of a jet engine. That was fine, until it was time for sleep and you realized that you can hear a loud WHOOOOSH every time the room next door would flush. If you're lucky, your neighbors won't be peeing and flushing all night....this was only a nuisance the first night this time. Front Desk: Nice as could be and very helpful with anything we needed. We had groceries delivered via Garden Grocer (good money saver in Disney) to the hotel prior to arriving and they held them for us. If you plan on renting a car though, just go to the supermarket on your own. They helped with any reservations we needed and made checking out and baggage for the flight pain free. Pool: The pool at the Port Orleans French Quarter is geared more towards children then it is adults. The slide is too slow for an adult to have a good time (Grand Floridian has a great one though). We went in December, while it reached 80 during the day, it was too chilly at night for swimming. There is also a separate hot tub/jacuzzi area. You are allowed to use Port Orleans Riverside's pools though, and they were much nicer for adults (and warmer for some reason). Food: Just a basic food court here. Pizza, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, hamburgers, sandwiches, etc. Nothing fancy, but it was good enough for a quick snack or meal. It might be my imagination, but the food was better this time. We also got breakfast this time and while the bacon was undercooked, the Mickey Waffles were excellent. Transportation: You can take the boat to Downtown Disney (only do this if you feel like taking your time) or you can use their shuttle bus service. Depending on where you are going, the trip can be a pain, or nice and quick. Magic Kingdom is about a 10-15 minute ride depending on whether you have to make the stops at Riverside too (although, you might be waiting at the bus terminal for up to 20 minutes for any bus). Epcot and MGM are also fairly quick rides at 10-15 minutes. Animal Kingdom is a little longer (and it also stops at Blizzard Beach) at maybe 15-20 minutes. We didn't take the bus to Downtown this time. Last time I raved about the shorter bus lines for Port Orleans. This time it seemed to be the opposite. Going to a park was always nice and quick, but getting home was a different story. Sometimes the lines were so long, you had to wait for a second bus...and even then you'd most likely be standing instead of having a seat. If we ever go back, I think we'll rent a car the entire time, it makes getting around soooo much quicker (especially when you're late for a dining reservation). The 3 days we had a car was great! Speaking of which, the drive times to Busch Gardens was about an hour and change, and Universal was about 30 minutes. Overall, it's a nice place to stay in Disney. Quick transportation to all the them parks (though not so quick to get back) and a moderate price each night. The pillows and the loud toilet flushing are the only big negatives.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mililani, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cconvenient, clean, moderately priced\u201d", "Author": "yoshi808", "ReviewID": "UR121896679", "Content": "Stayed 4 days w/ my girlfriend in 2nd week of December.

It only runs until 11pm, but that's still a fabulous plus, in addition to already being pretty centrally located relative to all of the parks.

There are many things that stand out about this resort, small size makes it quick and easy to get to the pool, market, main lobby or grab a bite to eat... No more than a 2 to 3 minute walk to get to anything that you need. Food options on site were pretty good, nothing fantastic but still ok for cafeteria type food. decent burgers, pizza breakfast items... nothing to write home about though. The bus stop was good not great, it was fantastic to be the first group on the bus as you leave for the parks, and first stop on the way back... In fact about 95% of the time French Quarter buses dont stop at Riverside while heading out to the parks... The only headache would be the buses staying on schedule while heading to the parks.. quite often 2 or 3 of the same buses would line up and would wait for people while folks waiting for magic kindom or epcot would wait 20-30 minutes... this only happened a few times so nothing too major. The room we stayed in was in building 5- room 5318... third floor (less noise) with a water view... There were 4 four of us in the room... and it felt very tight while we were in there... but as always, Disney rooms are not made for people to lay around in all day. Rooms are perfect size for 1 king size bed for a couples vacation. The decor was basic not over the top... The beds were not all that comfortable... rather stiff to me... and pack you pillows from home as there really wasnt much to them. Others have commented about room noise, I did not find this to be a problem at all... Occasionally you could hear a faint sound of a toilet flushing, but not enough to complain about. If you decide to stay here, you really wont be disappointed, nice boat ride to DownTown disney, 10-15 minutes, best moderate resort I have stayed at in Disney...

The beds were very comfortable, extra pillows were available in the room, and there was a mini fridge in the room. The housekeeping did a fantastic job on a daily basis. I say this because we were traveling with our two young children, and there was no shortage of mess from small food items such as goldfish crackers or powdered sugar from the fabulous beignet that was available for purchase in the food court. The room was obviously vacuumed daily. The property includes complementary shuttle service to the Disney parks, and it is also on the boat route to the Port Orleans - Riverside and Downtown Disney. The pool area is very nice, and they offer complementary life vests for kids to use during your stay. They also show a Disney movie outside each evening. We also took advantage of the complementary Magical Express transportation and luggage service to and from the airport. I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderfully easy Disney makes the whole traveling experience, and there is no doubt in my mind that we will return as soon as possible. I was surprised to have our boarding passes for our return flight printed and hanging on our door the morning of our departure as well as instructions on where to drop off our checked baggage at the resort so that we wouldn't have to worry about bringing it to the airport with us.

Stayed there over the Veteran's Day holiday with family. As always, Disney obliged to our special room request near transportation, ground floor. This hotel was recently remodeled and all the rooms are freshly painted and feature new furnishings. The room we stayed in was spotless! It was immaculately clean. If someone had told me that nobody had ever stayed in there before us, I would have believed it! Honestly, I've never seen such a clean hotel room. Outstanding. The rest of the campus was clean as well save the rubbish left behind by piggy people who can't be bothered to dump their empty soda cups in a waste basket less than a foot away from their tables but hey, they're on vacation right? Probably upset no Disney employee popped out of the bushes to throw it out for them when they drank that last drop! The food selection was the only downside. It was pretty grote. The soup was salty and breakfast was extremely greasy. Not a lot of vegetarian options either. I know, I know. Us vegetarians should just stay home and eat grass and let the meat eaters live in peace. But hey I'm sure your cholesterol would appreciate one or two less mickey mouse shaped hamburgers while on vacation. Just a suggestion Mickey. I know you have that space-aged green house over in Epcot and all. Just sayin'. The cast members were all very nice, courteous and helpful. None of those vacant stares some people get when you ask them a question. \"Oh no a customer! Quick! Act like I'm mentally incapable of grasping the point of their inquiry!\" At FQ you can hop on a little ferry boat and it takes you to Downtown Disney, a giant gift shop with restaurants. I enjoyed taking the ferry. You better get ready to wait at least 30-45 minutes to get on one though because the queue is long. No, I'm not British, I just enjoy saying queue. It is much funner than saying line. Also, the fairy boat makes a loud , piercing honking sound so get ready for that! Bus transportation is super convenient, especially to Magic Kingdom because as you know, the Kingdom is on an Island or something and you traditionally have to schlep over from the parking lot on a ferry or the monorail (more hideously long queues that make you want to stab yourself and others). So with a bus, TA-DA! They magically dump you off right at the front gates of the Magic Kingdom. Totally worth the $bazillion a night to stay at a Disney property because I hate to stand in a queue. It's bad enough you have to do that all day to get on rides, right? Why stand in a queue to get to the park? There are kids screaming about how they want to see Mickey Mouse, dad's drinking out of tiny liquor bottles, pining for a weekend golfing with their co-workers in accounting, mom's crying silently into their handbags. Yep. Not a pretty picture. You'll probably experience that on the bus too but you'll be sitting down and moving so you'll be less aggravated. Paying for a \"river view\" room is a waste of money. Don't get had! This is a tiny resort and a great deal of the rooms are away from the Sassagoula (or whatever the river is called...) so I don't even know where exactly the river view rooms are. But at any rate, what, are you staying in your room all day, glued to the chair, watching the ferry boats roar by with their loud honking? Is that what you went to Disney for? Save the money for one of the 25,000 gift shops at each of the parks. You can get a replica of the monorail and make little plastic disney characters stand in queues at home or you can buy a Mulan shaped candy bar. Yeah! Save that cash! There's a gift shop that takes up half the theme park at Magic Kingdom. You don't need a river view room or to save money for medical emergencies. Just slap a Jafar band-aid on that cracked skull. $14.99 for 7. FQ boats a pretty landscape, an arcade, a pool with some serpentine creature jutting out of it. It's a great little place to stay. And if you get bored of your hotel like the entitled, fickle Americans that we all are, you can always wander over to Riverside next door to see if the grass is greener. We didn't wander over there ourselves. If you stay at FQ, you're first to get dropped back home after a long day at the theme parks getting sunburned , screamed at by ungrateful children, taken for every red nickel you have and then told that Magic Kingdom is a DRY PARK. FQ offers great value and cleanliness. Unlike some of the other expansive properties, you don't have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs to help you find your car when you leave. Not like Coronado for instance. Sheesh. Somewhere on the trek between the parking lot and their room, some family ended up like the Donner party. You can also get one of those $14 souvenir cups you can refill your soda endlessly with during your stay at the resort. I think the cups are uh, the same for all the resorts and uh, I'm pretty sure that uh, maybe, they uh, don't change them.

The pool was crowded and was not designed for a swim so much as for playing in the water. Because the hotel is newly renovated we also expected amenities that just did not exist. For example, the \"safe\" in the room was not even large enough for my travel jewelry case, much less even one of the laptops that my husband and I are required to bring with us by our employers. The laptops had to be brought back and forth to the lobby where a cast member assisted us to lock them up. This meant waiting in line each time to be assisted by people who, much of the time, did not know the process for us signing them out. I remember staying at Disney when every cast member went out of his/her way to make guests feel at home and well taken care of, when they at least presented as if they knew everything OR at least would find out and help. We did try to eat at the food court one night, but the food available wasn't very good quality so we opted out.

I emailed before going (as per advised on POFQ unofficial guide) to request being near all amentities as my husband as walking difficulies whether they had it or not I don't know, but we couldn't have been better placed, we were in building 2, on ground floor with small garden area outside just across a small street was the pool, childrens play area, beyond that the hot tub, bar, laundry, just a little further was food court, shop and arcade for children, just at the end of our block was the dock for the boat to Downton Disney or up to Riverside. Our room was lovely and we had a huge bathroom as the vanity unit with the two hand basin were in there, we also had a wardrobe not hanging rail, my son next door had small bathroom with the hand basins outside with curtain but that suited them being four. The food court is quite small and busy as commented on in previous reveiws, but we always managed to get table, we also ate at Riverside which is a lot bigger with a different menu which gives more variety using both resorts. The boat to Downtown Disney is a nice and we also caught it up to Riverside for dinner as well, I can't comment on Riverside sit down restaurant as we didn't use it, but had lovely turkey dinners in the self service twice. I can't comment on bus transport as we only used it once to come back from Downtown but seems very good. There were activities for children by the pool in the day and movies some nights on the lawn and a pit for roasting marshmallows by building 5, although we didn't use them being busy in the parks. We choose POFQ being a moderate resort for the quick service dinning plan which we were very pleased with makes a big saving especailly with children although you do get a bit fed up on times with quick service Disney meals we then ate out at our favourite places. The snacks are also very good and good value, all in all worth the extra to have quick service dining plan. The only complaint myself and hubby have and we heard some Americans saying it as well the pool was cold, and some days colder than others depending on weather of course, but it didn't seem to be heated at all, as one American told us not what is says in brochure, it didn't deter our children at all they loved the pool and the hot tub, the hot tub was very nice after day in park and if you had taken a dip in the cold pool. This is a lovely resort and I would highly recommend it all the grounds were well taken care of as well, only thing being with the all the trees and bushes by our room and being near the river we had quite a lot of mosquito bites and I had left my plugin for room at home, apparently Florida had, had a lot of rain and they were out in force according to news. Riverside looks really nice as well but a lot bigger, for myself I think POFQ is easier to get around, and you can always go to Riverside for food or pools by boat, walking or driving.

However, POFQ housekeeping exceeded our expectations. The only odd thing we found about our room was that the previous occupants (from Canada) had left their passports behind... in the mini-refrigerator's freezer compartment, of all places. One call to the Front Desk had that \"issue\" immediately addressed. POFQ is a little oddly-located, yet it is in the middle of Walt Disney World, making it convenient to the theme parks. Typhoon Lagoon is close to this resort, as well as Downtown Disney/West End. Epcot is the closest theme park, with the Magic Kingdom a short drive away. While the drive is a little further to the Disney Hollywood Studios and the Animal Kingdom, the travel time isn't really so bad. Disney transportation is available to all resort guests, we find it more convenient to have a car. The price for theme park parking is waived for resort guests, providing a daily savings of $14 (2011 pricing). If we find ourselves wishing to stay at a Disney \"moderate\" resort, POFQ will be our pick.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lafayette ga", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort\u201d", "Author": "LafayetteGAmartin", "ReviewID": "UR120794544", "Content": "Our first stay onsite at Disney was at Riverside and we loved it.

Also, early admission into the park on selected days. Check in was quick and I used the on line check option, so the entire package is ready for me at the time of the check. Staff is always pleasant.

Have previously stayed at Pop Century but as just us two we thought we would give a Moderate Resort a try there was the added bonus of the free quick service dining plan. We booked Port Orleans as it appeared to have a more adult theme and not too Disney....silly you may think - why stay at Disney if you didn't want too much Disney?? Well i'll tell you why.... The resort was spotless not just clean, the staff were working around the clock sweeping, washing and just generally everywhere within the resort was SO clean The staff especially Mousekeeping were fantastic The grounds and setting/theme of the resort was beautiful...so relaxing Lovely pool Not too big - we stayed in building 7 the furthest away from the lobby but was not too far Excellent transportation system buses and the lovely boat to Downtown Disney Food at the Sassagoula Food Factory was very good, a little limited with choices but had fast food and healthy options and what can you say in our case it was FREE!! The quick service dining plan was AMAZING this saved us a fortune! The best tip I read before I went was if you have this plan then pay for breakfast and use your 2 meals for lunch and dinner. This is true as breakfast for two cost us $17 and the lunch or dinner would have cost $40 each time (for two). The snacks were great too, however do research this as Disney will advertise a piece of fruit as an example snack but you can have many other options especially ice creams and cakes/pastries from the bakery. Unless you get the refillable mug with your dining plan then buy one - it's such good value and these can be used for soft drinks and hot drinks unlimited within your resort. You do get a drink with each meal on the dining plan so we got bottles of water instead of a fountain soft drink as we could use the water to take to the parks! We like our food and the portions are so filling. The rooms were refurbished and very clean with a TV, Fridge, Double basin's and two beds! Air conditioning great and comfy beds - no complaints whatsoever. We used the Magical Express to and from Orlando International which was faultless! They had pool activities for the kids and also movies under the stars which was such a lovely idea! While we were there (10 nights) it rained for 48hrs solid but nobody cared, everyone was wearing their Disney poncho's and getting on with it The resort had plenty of children and Disney Magic however was not over the top and although the resort was well occupied it never felt overcrowded and was very quiet!

We live in the area, but far enough away to make staying in a hotel a reasonable idea. We got a Florida Resident discount and paid $140 total for the night, which is ridiculously cheap by Disney standards, so I knew going in this wasn't going to be deluxe accommodations. That being said, with it's exterior corridors, it reminded us of a Disney-fied Holiday Inn. The decor was New Orleans inspired of course, but to me it was a little worn out. They use old-school bedspreads, the kind I automatically remove upon getting in the room, for all the reasons you can imagine. The bed was hard as a rock. We both woke up with backaches. The bathroom was pretty nice, obviously recently renovated. Two sinks, which is great for us. The shower needed a little help, as I had to wait a good five minutes for hot water, and the shower head was finicky. Being that it has exterior corridors, we heard noise throughout the whole night and morning. On the positive side, there is Disney service still behind the scenes. We were greeted professionally & warmly at all times. Everyone we ran into was very accommodating, and they provided us with the late check out we requested. All in all, it was not a horrid experience, but just average and served our purpose for one night. I just cannot fathom paying the normal standard rate of around $200/night here.

We go to Orlando a lot (you could even say a rediculous amount, as this was our third trip this year) simply because we love Disney. Over the years, we've stayed a number of places, from Disney's budget resorts, to the Ritz-Carlton, to Marriott timeshare villas, and we've loved them all, but this resort was something special. First, it is a sensory delight. Narrow French Quarter \"streets\" lead you through beautiful gardens of rose bushes and magnolia trees and past peaceful fountains and sitting areas as horse-drawn carriages clip-clop by. And did I mention the river? The resort sits on a river and you can catch a boat to Downtown Disney. We did, and we loved it! The room was very nice and we were fortunate to have a room with a river view. Not a big room, but a very smart use of space. A curtain divides the bath and vanity area from the rest of the room for a private dressing area, and the dresser/TV stand contains a mini fridge that we found very helpful for keeping our snacks and drinks chilled. The housekeeper kept the room beautiful, and she surprised us everyday with a new towel animal! The food court was hectic and noisy, as food courts are, but the staff were helpful and friendly. A couple of pieces of advice-- I suspect that we got a top floor river view room (quiet!) because I booked over the phone and had a great conversation with the booking agent about our family size, and what we were interested in, etc. In the past, I've done everything online and therefore, I didn't have that advocate saying, \"I think you want to stay in the newly renovated building,\" or, \"I can get you a better view for $60 more...\" From now on, I'll always book by phone. Another tip, get a dining plan. We've been making this trip at least once a year for 10 years, and this was the first time we purchased a dining plan. I'm a little embarrassed to admit what a slow learner I am, but I've finally learned that the dining plan is a good thing! It makes your trip completely worry-free.

We decided to try the Disney bus system one day, and I cannot recommend that if you have your own car.

We had a great time; however there were definitely some issues with the hotel. My goal is to give an honest review, both positive and negative. This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel, the first was about seven years ago \u2013 we really liked the hotel at that time and we looked forward to returning. Check in was fast and efficient, we had our room assigned and had keys to it around 11:30 a.m., well before the actual check in time. The person at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. She told us where our room was at and we were disappointed that we were assigned a room on the first floor when we had requested a room on the 3rd floor. They acknowledged the request and changed our rooms without a problem; the person even mentioned that she didn\u2019t understand why we were assigned a 1st floor room when we had requested a higher floor. None the less we were happy to be checked in and head out to the parks. We had an issue with getting our luggage from Magical Express \u2013 due to the room not being the one originally assigned. It took one call and our luggage was in the room by the time we returned for the night. A couple of days into our stay and the toilet in our room stopped flushing. We called for maintenance and were told that someone would be there shortly. We waited for an hour, and no one showed up (we did specifically note the times of the calls) two more times and finally we got someone after waiting for two hours. I was very frustrated with waiting around, I realize that people have access to your room whenever they want, but I did not have access to a shower or toilet so that made getting ready to go out kind of impossible. I called and asked to speak to a manager, they seem to have someone on duty, however they had to radio her and have her call me back. She called just as maintenance arrived, and offered me some fast passes to whatever park I wanted for my troubles. I was annoyed, but accepted this. She indicated that she would call me back with a case number so I could pick them up at guest services at whatever park we wanted. Before she called back the maintenance person indicated they might have to replace the toilet \u2013 when the manager called back I told her about this and she offered me a room change or access to another room so we could use the shower in that room. About that time the maintenance person indicated that they found a toothbrush in the toilet and that the toilet was now flushing. He indicated that we should call housekeeping so they could come clean up the mess he made. I declined the other room because I was under the impression that the issue was resolved. The wait started all over again with housekeeping, they told us someone would be up there right away and nearly an hour went by and we had to call back again they said it would be at least another 15 minutes. At this point I was furious because I still couldn\u2019t use the bathroom, so I went up to the front desk in hopes of talking to this manager and letting her know that there are some serious issues with resolving this problem. She was not at the desk, but I spoke to the front desk manager and he was very friendly and apologetic. The whole point of a hotel room is the bathroom and the bed \u2013 it\u2019s a big deal that the bathroom was unusable and that no one seemed to think it was a priority. I asked that the front desk manager please communicate my dissatisfaction with things and he assured me he would. I assume that the bathroom was cleaned up while we were out for the evening. The very next day we were out of the room early and gone until 6:30 p.m. We returned and the room and was upset to see that the room had not been cleaned at all. I called housekeeping and got the front desk and told them the room wasn\u2019t cleaned. They immediately asked if I left my privacy sign up, which I did not. She apologized and transferred me to housekeeping; the person who answered in housekeeping was not at all friendly and did not apologize. They said they would send someone to clean and asked that they wait an hour so we could get ready to go out to dinner. I called the manager I spoke with the day before and she was apologetic and admitted that they screwed up badly between my issues the day before and the room not being cleaned today. She refunded my nightly rate for that night and asked if we wanted turn down service when they came to clean up \u2013 I accepted and appreciated her admitting the problem and doing something to make up for my lost time. We did get a phone call from a housekeeping manager apologizing for the issues and she also stopped by later in the week to make sure everything was going well and our room was cleaned up to our standards. I appreciated someone making that effort. I\u2019d like to mention that either of these two issues on their own would be irritating, but it was the combination of problems on two consecutive days that made me so mad. I felt like my time was not being respected and that they didn\u2019t view these problems as issues. I fully understand that a room can sometimes be missed while cleaning, and under normal circumstances I wouldn\u2019t have expected anything in return \u2013 but again it was that coupled with my totally wasted evening the night before. After these two nights we had no other issues. I found bus service to be very good at this hotel (better than Wilderness Lodge and Animal Kingdom Lodge); we didn\u2019t wait more than 10 minutes for a bus going to a park from the hotel and not more than 20 from a park to the hotel. It was inconvenient that we had to stop at the four stops at Riverside some times, but that didn\u2019t happen all the time. Boat service to and from downtown Disney was very relaxing and a nice change from the crowded buses. We ate in the food court for breakfast a couple of mornings and for a snack one evening \u2013 the employees were all nice and one particular cashier seemed very sincerely interested in learning about where everyone was from and if they were having a great time. The grounds at this hotel really are beautiful and impeccably clean. While we do not have children the activities that they have for them really seemed nice, I thought the movies in the court yard would be a great way for kids to settle down in the evening. We stopped at the front desk a couple of times to check our room charges and those employees were always friendly and helpful. The rooms do look a lot nicer since the renovations; however they are still a very basic hotel. The bathroom is unbelievably tiny; it\u2019s nice that the sinks and mirrors are separate from the shower area and there is more space to get ready there \u2013 however the bathroom is among the smallest I have ever seen at a hotel. The beds are all queen sized now, but they are still using the head/footboards from the full sized beds so it looks a bit odd. I found the beds to be EXTREMELY uncomfortable and I woke up with a back ache the last four nights. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d stay here again, I think that Disney hotels are overpriced for what you get \u2013 but I realize that you are paying for all of the extras associated with a Disney hotel. I\u2019m not sure I would stay at a Disney hotel again unless I was getting free dining or a substantial room discount.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cSpectacular service and grounds\u201d", "Author": "HMByrd", "ReviewID": "UR120290381", "Content": "Our party consisted of my husband, his parents, my 3 yr old son and me.

If you are addicted to your morning joe like I am, I highly recommend bringing in those filter packs, they're wonderful. You can grab creamer and sugar from the food court. The pool is awesome - a big dragon slide, and playful alligator statues surround the area. The boat service to downtown Disney and PO-Riverside was a nice option as well. What I really, really liked about this resort is the layout. The buildings are fairly close together and compared to other WDW resorts, there is not a crazy amount of walking involved to get to the main building and transportation. As both of my children have gross motor issues and my Dad has nerve damage in his right leg, this was an important feature for us.

This year there were 5 of us including my 3 year old grandson so I wanted to simplify it and use the Disney Magical Express and Disney Transportation. This worked out very well for us and gave us more freedom in general. I choose Port Orleans, because the resort has recently been refurbished and now has 2 queen sized beds in a standard room. This is a well themed, smaller resort that makes it easy to get around and the overall atmosphere of this resort is charming and relaxed with enough little touches to please people of all ages. It was particulary nice in the evening with terrific jazz music at Scat Cats off the main lobby. It drew a crowd including families and older people who just wanted to relax and wind down. I just can't say enough about the atmosphere and precious moments like seeing a dad and his daughter dancing in the lobby... truly magical. The location and ease of gettting around was A+. The DisneyTransportation was very good and there was never much of a wait to go to the parks. The buses were not overly crowded other than park closing time which is understandable, but they come more often at that time and you could wait for the next one. One of the best features of this resort is that you can also take the Sassagoula River boat to Downtown Disney or Port Orleans Riverside. We took the riverboat to Riverside once for lunch at the foodcourt and once for dinner at Boatwright's Cafe. They were two of the best meals we had at Disney. It is not always easy to find nice fresh food when you're on Disney property so this was a real treat. The food court has a salad bar where you can create your own salad and it was fresh, delicious, and huge. Boatwright's Cafe was really good too.......... and ohhhhh the roast beef! French Quarter also has a food court, but doesn't have a sit down restaurant like Riverside. The boat ride to Riverside is worth the adventure and the resort is worth seeing. They had live music at Riverside as well in the lounge area next to the restaurant and everyone was having the best time. The music was great and there were many families with their children on stage having a sing along. I noticed on the boat ride back after dark that there was a large screen movie being shown on the other side of the river. Now this would be enough to please many, but there's more...... they also have horse drawn carriage rides! We saw this a couple of times, but we were unable to get a reservation. The carriage ride goes from Riverside over to French Quarter and back again. We happened to be going into dinner when it crossed in front of us and the sound of the horses hoofs added to the already wonderful atmosphere. There is also a walking path along the river between the resorts and I could see people out for a stroll, sitting and taking it all in or out for a romantic walk. We even saw a marshmellow roast at our resort and the captain got us to say \"We Want Marshmellows\" at the count of 3. Very cute........ they were all waving and holding up there sticks showing off their delicious treats. All and all this is a wonderful resort and you can enjoy it and it's sister property for the price of one... they are both very different and worth the experience. I wouldn't have to be going to the parks to enjoy myself. In fact I'm very anxious to go back with the intention of enjoying all the resorts have to offer just to relax and go to Downtown Disney. It's nice there in the evening and you can take the boat over, have a little \"Happy Hour\" and see La Nouba and not have to worry about driving... just relax. The Earl Of Sandwich is also at Downtown Disney and worth honorable mention. Never let the lines scare you no matter how long they are as they really have their act together. It's a great place for lunch or a light supper with delicious sandwiches, salads, fresh fruit and other desserts. There you have it and now my fond memories just make me want to go back. It's nice to try different resorts, but I haven't had enough of this one yet and need to go back to fully discover and enjoy all the wonderful touches this special resort has to offer... including it's sister resort.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "University Park, PA", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!!\u201d", "Author": "PSUNittanyLion", "ReviewID": "UR120019536", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon after getting married in Disney.

I am however, pleased to say that this is a brilliant hotel. We stayed in builiding 3 which was only a 2 minute from reception, the pool, the shop and the quick service restaurant. The other good thing about this hotel is the ability to park your car opposite your building. This means that nothing is more than a short walk away. TIP: when you first check-in, leave your cases in the car as you will be told to park your car next to your building. This will save you making two trips with your luggage. This hotel is only a pleasant 5 minute walk down the river away from the Port Orleans Riverside resort and the additional amenities it has to offer (different food choices at the quick service restaurant, horse and carriage rides, bike and boat hire). We were on the Disney Quick Service Dining plan and were able to exchange meal credits for any three snack items at French Quarter. This was useful to us as we used more snacks (drinks, ice cream, beignets etc.) than actual meals. Our room was spotless and we were very pleased with the Mousekeeping. We had a few towel animals and our housekeeper left us a birthday card signed by Mickey and Minnie for my son's birthday. All of the staff was very helpful and pleasant and there were lots of acitivites for the children; marshmallow roasting around the fire, games around the pool, an outdoor cinema each evening etc. My only criticism would be the number of motorised buggies the staff used to drive around in. They had loud petrol engines and we saw them everywhere we went. This was quite irritating at 7:00am or while trying to enjoy an evening stroll along the river. This is not something I remember seeing at Animal Kingdom Lodge. On balance though, I would definitely stay at this hotel again, and due to the central location of both the rooms and the hotel itself to the parks and downtown Disney, I think I would go as far as saying that I actually prefer this hotel over Animal Kingdom Lodge.

I beleive that Disney, in general, is vastly over-priced for the quality, and that is across the board. Negatives about the resort: the room decor was too over-the-top for me with dark wood furniture, gold colored walls, and purple and gold bedspreads. I know that the theme is Mardi Gras, but a more relaxing decor would have been appreciated after the constant over-stimulation of the DIsney Parks. The bathroom was very small. Every night we ran out of hot water for the shower. There were very few hangers -definitely bring some of your own if you want to hang more than a few items. Really, very limited drawer space, too. A small, gaudy room for the price that you pay. The decor looks better in my photos than it did to my live eye. Positives: The beds were reasonably comfortable. Not the best that I've slept on, but no one awoke with a backache. The kids loved the swimming pool and the costumed greeters who stood by the lobby door each day, wishing them a magical day and handing out trinkets. The resort grounds, unlike the room, had a calming effect with its wide, cobblestone walkways, a small river meandering through, and the clop-clop-clop of horses hooves as a horse drawn carriage circled the property. The hot tub was actually hot. The cleaning woman/man always arranged the children's stuffed animals into a cute display, which the thrilled the children. In the moderate price range, I'm not sure that you can do better than this resort at Disney. I would, however, try to get a recently updated room.

The gift shop is good for snacks and bits and pieces but i would just nip to downtown disney for gifts. Didnt use the pool but looked lovely and never over crowded. Had no problems with buses, epcot was probably the longest wait on the way back and not many of the buses went to riverside first. I would recommended going to other resort hotels for lunch or dinner too as you can use the dining plan there! We went to Camp Fort Wilderness and did the smores and met chip and dale, well worth a visit!! (8 dollars for marshmallows, graham crackers and 2 chocolate bar) rooms were also very clean and maid left us couple of towel animals.

Staff was friendly and helpful and all was clean and well maintained. Transportation everywhere was fantastic... Boat to Downtown Disney, buses to and from theme parks and airport were very convenient. Poolside activities were fun and well staffed. I imagine the time of year and week (Mid-Oct, Mon-Fri) didn't hurt any but I, my daughter and 5 year old granddaughter enjoyed every minute. Nice restaurant w/ good food choices. Easy walk to Port Orleans Riverside with more leisure activities. We had signed up for (KidCamp-type) Pirate Adventure Thurs AM, but it was cancelled due to lack of participation. Would have appreciated other organized child activities on down days to give us adults time out. We were situated in a room overlooking the river which was quiet, clean and comfortable with every amenity we needed. Minor setbacks included room lighting with two blaring lights over each bed and another ceiling light, any one which by itself illuminated the room to the max. Smaller, directional lights for reading late while the rest of the family sleeps would have been good-- take a small reading light and/or night light if you fit this scenario. Also, TV wasn't the greatest with fitful remote and volumn seeming to blare w/ Disney channels and needing a boost w/ regular TV, and a challenge to use (like the lights) late or early while some of us slept. Also, good toilets w/ good flush, but we could hear toilets flush in rooms adjacent all night/morning. How to stifle the noise of a flushing toilet? No other noise issues.

Our 5th visit to Orlando but 1st time in a Disney hotel. As said before, it's all been refurbished to a high standard and the grounds are beautiful and so well kept. The room was cleaned every day and towels replaced plus new soaps and shampoo/ conditioner left each day of our stay. These were Mickey themed and we took them home for the kids, all 10 sets! We were left both hard and soft pillows so as we could choose. The room had a coffee maker which could also heat water if you wanted tea. You can collect tea bags from the dining room and they leave you plenty of coffee each day. There is a fridge in the room and a washing line over the bath to hang your wet swim wear etc. Air con is also a heater which you can set to be as hot or cold as you like. We had 2 large double beds and a separate bathroom and vanity area. The up dated photos were exactly what we got. We tipped the maid 4 dollars a day and she seemed really pleased and she made us a few towel art designs on our bed. Our room was on the 3rd floor in building 2, facing the gardens with a fountain. It was so quiet and convenient for the pool, shop, reception, dining area, laundry, bus stop and boat launch to Riverside and Downtown Disney. We had no car as we were just doing the Disney parks this time. The buses were usually every 20 mins and sometimes you had to stand. The boats were a lovely way to travel if going to Downtown Disney, such a pretty trip and a nice alternative from always being on a bus. The river really sets this resort apart from some of the others. We visited many of the other Disney hotels and thought the grounds, boat rides, serpent themed pool, friendliness of staff and newly decorated hotel, meant the French Quarter came out on top for us. Because of it's reasonably small size, everything is close enough to get to quickly but including Riverside, the resort is spacious and gives you another feel if you take a nice walk over there along the river...the best of both worlds. We had the free quick service dining plan which worked out great for us. We didn't want to make reservations for dining 6 months before we went on the restaurant dining so we were happy to eat when and where we liked. Be sure to look on the many websites which tell you the best places to use your credits and learn about the snacks you can choose. You can choose the most expensive meals and desserts from anywhere and snack credits can be used on almost any item under 4 dollars, so we used them for breakfasts. There are places which serve salads, pasta, and mashed potato and veg meals if you don't want to live on burger and chips all the time. I spent an hour or so before going to check out all the tips on using the quick service plan to our best advantage and wrote a few things down...it paid off. Our only small complaint was that the breakfast room could get very full at peak times and it was hard to find a table. Sometimes, when you did eventually get one, it would not be cleaned. The staff all worked hard but could not always keep up. One or two of them liked to talk to everyone rather than wipe the tables but that meant that they made you feel very welcome. A refillable resort mug was given to us on our dining plan to use whilst at the hotel and you could fill it as many times as you liked with hot and cold soft drinks. If you are not on the dining plan, you get disposable cups left in your room which you can use to help yourself to the same drinks in the dining room. No one seems to mind this as it's the only way to get a drink unless you buy the bottled ones. They even supply you with the cup tops by the drinks machines. Try the hot chocolate, it's so creamy! If staying in Disney parks, you don't need a car. We had the magical express to and from the airport which was great. There were plenty of Taxis in the car park always but our rep told us they were expensive. The pool was open until 12.00am and in the day time there were 3 lifeguards in attendance. There were always plenty of sun beds and a bar. Laundry room was next to the pool area and a wash cost 2 dollars, so did a tumble dry. At certain times there was entertainment for the kids at the pool and marshmallow and film evenings by building 5. Always playing was the music from the Orleans area. I'm going on a bit now, so will end here. I will answer anyone's questions if I can, if you need further help with anything. Just to say, I would love to go there again and thought that with the free meals, it made a very good value trip.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Myers, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cOctober Stay\u201d", "Author": "Alana F", "ReviewID": "UR119441586", "Content": "We just completed our 3 night stay here & loved it.

When we arrived we were taken aback at how beautiful and quaint the resort was! Our Room was in building one which is a two miniute from reception but so close to the boat dock, that takes you to downtown Disney. We much prefered to take the boat. I was so pleased to see that we had been given a corner room! I would recomend that anyone planning to stay here to request one, it made the room bright and spacious with a table and chairs in the corner. You could tell it had been referbished recently. The two beds were huge and one of the comfyiest beds i have ever slept on. The bathroom and sink area was very good, with a his and hers sink there was no crowding and the shower was just what you needed at a very long day. Mousekeeping was brilliant and cleaned our room very well, she even made a towl animal with mardi gra beads when she saw all my birthday cards. We recommend tipping at least a $1 per person when you get your room cleaned or have fresh towels. A few times it wasn't necessary for our room to be cleaned or have fresh towels so we did choose to put the do not disturb sign in the key slot. The buses are brilliant, they do the job that there to do. A couple of times we were waiting a good while. Coming back from Hollywood Studios late one night we waited about 30 minutes which is long enough especially when humid. We witnessed twice that night people in electric chairs going straight to the front of the que and as there party can get on with them, the people waiting at the front were getting very angry, especially when 9 people got on with their family member. It seemed no buses were coming and children were falling asleep on there parents. Leaving that little bit earlier would shorten the wait and avoid the long ques. After a long day just hope that the bus stops at FQ first because it takes another 10 miniutes to go around the four stops at Riverside which can be very tedious. On our trip we had the quick service dining plan, which was great value for money you could go the parks and not spend any money on drinks and food and with the prices they charge you save an absolute fortune. It took a little getting used to the point system but you pick it up. However the food offered at some of the parks and at POFQ was extremely limiting, this would seem to contradict some of the reveiwes on here, but i only eat fish and the amount of meat on the menu there in my opinion is ridiculous. Even my other half who could eat meat all day was fed up by a couple of days in. At POFQ for breakfast i lived on a bagel and a milkshake. They offered the french toast, (with icing sugar - weird) bacon and/or sausages scrambled eggs with cheese etc. At some of the parks we walked around for ages looking for something that i could eat, for example at Hollywood Studios the only thing was a vegatable sanwhich that wasn't very appetising at all i ended up chucking it away. There was a lovely looking sandwhich and cake shop near Mickeys hat that didnt even have a vegetarian option! All meat. Some days i just ate salad bowls, a few times the lack of food made me so close to tears! When i found a Subway i was so excited to have fresh salad rather than something out a bag. The Parks are amazing great for all ages. The rides and characters are the best and live up to Disneys name. A few tips we have would be for anyone who is from the UK is to plan your first few days very well, and use the jet lag to your advantage we did our early access to Harry Potter (Virgin deal) on our second day becuase you have to be up very early. NB. Harry Potter at Universal is amazing. Choose the frozen butterbeer. Being up early is great for this however depending on how bad you suffer from jet lag, like me you wont be able to make it to any fireworks or late extra magic hours the first couple of nights. Overall Port Orleans Fench Quater was really good, and well worth the value for a moderate resort, givng you something different from the hustle and bustle of the parks, whilst keeping the disney magic. I would definately recomend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stop at a disney hotel.

We have never had an issue finding a spot close to our building since it's never been overcrowded on our visits (and there have been many as Florida residents). Rooms have recently been renovated so that all include two queens instead of two doubles. Also, even though the rooms aren't really intended for parties larger than 4 (unless the 5th party is a baby in a crib), my three kids (8, 6, and 3) have been able to fit comfortably in one bed. As part of the renovations, the bathrooms have been updated so that bath/toilet/sinks are in one room with a door (pre-reno, the sinks were separated from the sleeping area by a curtain with the toilet/tub in a separate room w/door). Not sure I care for that since, with 5 people, I liked having access to the sinks at all times. There is a playground for small children, but it was closed our last visit. The pool is great - kids love the dragon slide (and there is a smaller pool for toddlers). So much nicer than the pool at Port Orleans Riverside!

Also, be sure to get the refillable mug if you love fountain drinks.

There were a lot of great things about the hotel. 1. It is a pretty hotel and very clean. 2. The hotel is efficient (asked for things like a rollaway and extra towels and shampoo and it was there immediately). 3. The food court has a decent amount of choices and the pricing isn't horrible, given that it's Disney. 4. There seemed to be a lot of neat resort activities. We were only there 3 days and they were long days so we didn't participate in the activities but I saw them doing a movie on the lawn where people had blankets and towels and they were showing the movie The Incredibles. Also, one day it rained and I noticed in the food court there were staff playing with kids and they had a box of games labeled \"Rainy Day.\" 5. The rooms were nice and pretty big. We had 2 queens plus there was a rollaway and my dad's electric scooter. So it was tight with all of that in there but not really bad. I was happy with the size. There was also a complimentary fridge and the rollaway was free. What I didn't love about the hotel were more personal preferences, not anything about the hotel itself so that's why I ended up going with the \"very good.\" The hotel was pretty spread out so it required a lot of walking. I was with a disabled parent though so it probably affected me more so than it would others. We forgot to tell the AAA lady to book a handicapped room or one that was closer to the buses/food and when we got there they didn't have any handicapped rooms or any rooms closer to the front so we ended up in building 6. I think buildings 5 and 4 are closer to the buses/food depending on the side of the building you are on. Also, it was still pretty hot in Florida when we were there so I prefer a hotel where everything is inside one central building. At POFQ the rooms open directly to the outside. So in the rain or heat it can be a pain walking to where you want to go. One thing that was annoying is that you could hear the toilet flushing from the room above you. Thankfully it didn't happen often but you'd be trying to sleep at 11:30 and hear a loud \"kkkuuuushhhh\" of the toilet above you. Once I fell asleep it wasn't loud enough to wake me up but it was a little annoying trying to go to sleep. I wouldn't say it was bad enough to keep me from staying here if I wanted to. Overall, if you are going to Disney with a family and for a longer trip I think this would be a great choice given all the activities and the moderate price. However, if I were a couple going for 3-4 days I'd probably pay the extra and stay at a deluxe resort. My husband and I went and stayed at Wilderness Lodge and I believe it's the cheapest of the deluxe options so I'd price compare the two and if it wasn't much more I'd get a deluxe.

At the time of our stay, the basic meal plan was included in several packages offered by Disney, so the resort was full (We do the wine & dine plan. Well worth the $ if you love wine).

Disney has also expanded their snacks to include a breakfast order of 3 beignets, a must-have @ POR's food court! Buses arrived in a timely & efficient manner, never keeping guests waiting longer than 10 minutes for a destination. The water taxi was a 15 minute leisurely, relaxing ride to Downtown Disney & passes the newly-renovated Treehouse Villas!

We were in building 4, room 4112. We used Disney's Magical Express to get from the airport to the resort. We love DME and had a great experience yet again. Prior to arriving, we completed online check in. When we got to POFQ, there was a line of maybe 4 people ahead of us (from our DME bus). We waited maybe 5 minutes before getting our packet and heading to our room. We checked in around 1030am and our room was ready for us. The resort is small, very clean, and very New Orleans. It didn't have a huge \"Disney\" feel to us. Last year we were WOW'ed by Animal Kingdom Lodge, but POFQ didn't really wow us. With that said, there was nothing wrong with this resort... it just wasn't overly Disney or as amazingly themed as AKL. The walkways around the resort are small versions of streets with street names, light posts, and sidewalks. It is very cute. There are courtyards between the buildings, one of which they show movies in the evening on a huge blow up screen. There are several fountains through out the resort, making it very peaceful. The pool was great. There is a nice water slide and lots of kids activities through out the afternoon. We never had any trouble finding chairs and there were always plenty of towels available. Our room was on a corner, close to the stairs and elevator. There was a crack around the door that allowed love bugs to enter our room- every time we walked in, we had to grab some tissues to get all of the bugs. The beds were comfortable but our pillows were really flat (I am sure they would have brought us more if we had asked, but we didn't). The room was very convenient to get to the bus in the morning, and the restaurant/lobby. The pool was not a far walk as the resort is pretty compact. We did not have any issues with noise (although, the toilets flushing are rather loud so we did hear them every once in a while- not a big deal though). There are double sinks with a nice shelf above the sink area for storage. The curtain separating the bathroom area from the bedroom was a nice touch for changing and getting ready. The bath tub also had a shelf for storage which was great for all of our toiletries. Water pressure was decent and we never had issues with water temperature. The safe is small, but great for travel documents, wallets, money, Kindle, etc. We left mousekeeping tips in little envelopes every day, but we did not receive any towel art after the day of our arrival (Mickey on the bed). There is a fridge in the room, great for water or snacks as needed. Bus service was great. We never waited more than 10 minutes at the resort. One morning a bus came full from POR guests but there was a second MK bus right behind it that was empty. One evening when we returned to Epcot from the resort, the bus stopped at all four POR stops after picking us up. Other than that one time, we did not share buses with POR at all. The counter/quick service restaurant had lots of options and HUGE portion sizes available. We enjoyed the freshly made beignets a couple times (Yum!) and refilled our water bottles multiple times a day. We ate lunch/dinner our last day and used up some extra snack credits on the rice crispy treats to bring home. The ice cream portions for a snack credit are huge. It was never overly crowded when we were there. One afternoon I used the laundry facilities- $2 for each wash and $2 for each dry. There are amble machines to use as well as detergent to buy if needed. The wash and dry take 30 minutes each. We took the boat to Downtown Disney one evening. It was nice to have another option other than buses. It took about 15 mins each way and the wait was only a few minutes. I wish we had more time to take the boat to DTD more than once. Overall, we had a really nice stay at POFQ. For a moderate resort, it was a great choice for us. If we had not stayed at AKL last year, we probably would have loved it even more. POFQ is a relatively quiet, small, peaceful resort that is a nice break from the busy parks. For small children, I think I would rather stay at POP (or the new Art of Animation) to get the Disney characters and theme more abundantly.

The four of us were comfortable in our room because of the extras -- shower & WC separate from the double sinks with a curtain that created a private dressing area.

From the moment we checked in, the staff where so friendly and helpful and our room was nice and close to the restaurant which was very handy as we had two small children with us it was not too far to walk down to breakfast each morning and then to the free shuttle bus to travel to the individual parks. We had a lovely room up on the 2nd floor with a beautiful view out through the abundant trees that line the property. The room was a good size with 2 queens size beds and bathroom with Bath/shower and toilet and a separate change room area that could be closed off with a curtain. We would come back to our cleaned room each day to find the towels creatively folded into different animals or Mickey shapes, which the children thought was fantastic. The resort itself has a nice feel walking around it with lots of gardens and trees and a really good sized swimming pool which was open until midnight, which did come in handy after coming back to the hotel after a long hot day out at Disney to be able to go for a swim at 11pm before bed ... The resort also was located on the riverbank which had free shuttle boats that took you to the downtown Disney area too, which was a great trip to take in itself especially at night !! There was also a children's playground (which looked like it was getting an upgrade as we were leaving) and huge coin operated laundry room too, which was also very handy when travelling with children and open 24 hours with your room key. There was also a horse drawn carriage that we saw on our first night roaming the cobble stoned streets around the resort, but were back too late every other night to actually go for a ride ourselves. When we booked this trip we also took up the Quick Service Meal Plan Option of \"2 x Quick Service Meals (which included drinks) and 2 x Snacks\" per person per day. This was the best thing we had done as it meant that each day when we left the resort all we needed to take was our room key card, which was our Disney Parks ticket and our meal plan vouchers all rolled into one. This was so much easier than carrying cash around and when we bought anything from the parks or downtown disney then we just had it sent back to our hotel to save us from carrying it around with us all day and night. Also when buying food/drinks/snacks etc for a family much better not to need any cash, just show them your card and the items would come off your total meals allocation. I think this is an excellent idea from Disney and really just makes your trip that much easier and hassle free, as was the \"Photo Pass\" which is a registered card which you show to the disney photographers every time you get your photo taken by any one of them at any one of the parks and ALL the photos are available in one place to order online prints or downloads or make books or other products you are able to get made up after your trip and sent to you. The restaurant was casual quick service style but was varied and also was open until midnight. Also it had a drink station for self serve soft drinks, tea and coffee etc. This is a great hotel with great service and will really make a stress free Disney holiday complete. Travelling with small children (5yrs and 3 yrs) this was a perfect hotel to ensure we had a perfect stress free 8 day trip to Disney World.

Just returned from a 6 night stay Sept 7-13. Every cast member was so nice and polite (like all of Disney) and were willing to help w/ anything you needed. Resort was not crowded at all first couple of days, but got pretty busy around the 11th and 12th. Resort - We loved this resort! Thanks goodness for this place or our vacation would have been a total wash! It was 'smaller' than other Disney resorts, but not small compared to other places we have stayed. We stayed in buidling 7 which is considered 'North Quarter' and is closest to Port Orleans Riverside. Rooms - They felt a little small, but were the size of a basic hotel room. We got a corner room which was great because we had 2 windows which made the room seem bigger, and we had a view of the river, although we only booked a standard. The little bathroom/vanity area was nice as well. Lots of storage for our stuff. We never found the pack'n'play bed for the little one, but since the beds are Queen size we had plenty of room for all 3 girls in one bed. We only used Mousekeeping a few times, but they were great when we did. Food - We ate at the Quick Service dining room mostly for breakfast and a few times for lunch. Food is ok, not bad, not good. It does get a little old after a while. We were on the dining plan, but if you are not, you can look to spend about $10 per person per meal and about $3 per drink or dessert. Pool - My kids LOVED the pool and pool slide. They also loved the pool activities they put on daily. My 4 year old actually won 2 games! :) She was excited to get to pick a prize from the treasure chest. The pool changes depths throughout so I would suggest a life vest for any kids that are not great swimmers. You can get them free of charge to keep for your entire stay from Jackson store. It was great my 4 year old that is not a swimmer could go down the slide and follow her older sister around the pool the without problems! Pirate Cruise - My older 2 girls did a Pirate Bayou Adverture cruise and had a lot of fun. It is a 2 hour boat ride (leaves from PO Riverside next door) that takes the kids on a treasure hunt. It is about $35 a kid, they get little a snack, trinkets and toys (pirate related of course) along the way! Buses - Bus transportation is very easy to understand and clearly posted. Buses came often, we never waited longer than 15 min for one. Once on them is another story and probably could be another review. Some are fast and crowded trips, some are long and not so crowded, some have lots of stops along the way and some head straight to the destination. Folding and unfolding a loaded stroller is a pain after the 4th or 5th time! Boats - There is a dock at POFQ that goes to POR and to DTD. You could easily walk to POR from POFQ, but is fun to ride the boat as well! The trip to DTD would have to be by bus or by boat, and since there is so much bus riding already to the parks, boat was much more fun! We never waited more than 10 min for a boat to pick us up! I also liked that you didn't have to fold up your stroller on the boat! POR - Although this review is about POFQ, we visited POR a few times so felt like I should mention it in my review as well. My kids loved the POR pool and slide. They thought it was even better than the POFQ pool and slide. Also, the Quick Service dining room had so much more to pick from than the POFQ QS dining room. I would suggest going over there for if you don't mind the walk (about 10 min at most). We also ate at Boatwrights one night, I didn't care for the food much and the service was the slowest of any place we ate on our entire vacation, but of course the staff was very nice! The POR also had a lot more stuff to do it seemed, marina activiities, horse carriage rides, etc. It's very pretty to pull into the marina at night on the boat. Would I stay here again?

But, staying in a room there can mean a very long walk down corridors when you just wanted to get coffee! No, for shear all-points perfection it's French Quarter for us. Here's why: -Size of Resort: I believe this has to be the smallest Disney resort and therefore no matter where your room is located you will not have a long walk to the food court or to transportation! Although, because we faced a parking lot one time, we do pay for a water view. -Size of Room: Moderate in price, but spacious room size due to the fact that it was built a while ago. -Location in \"the World\": Can get to any of the parks rather quickly and boating to Downtown Disney is our check-in day activity (must eat at Earl of Sandwich, Ice Cream at Ghiridelli's). We also hit DD after check-out leaving our car at French Quarter...one last peaceful boat ride to say good-bye! Not Crowded: Unlike it's sister resort, \"Riverside\", the food court will not be noisy and crowded. Also, and this is BIG...you get picked up first at the Bus Depot before heading to Riverside (sometimes you have your own bus and skip Riverside all together). This means you have a seat! Also, coming back from the parks, French Quarter gets dropped off first. Atmosphere: Though you can easily stroll or boat to Riverside's amenities, the French Quarter pool and all facilities, including the food court are great.

The French Quarter is about 1/3 the size of Riverside and makes everything rarely quick to get to....pool, dining, arcade, gift shop, nightly movies and bonfires. The rooms are newly renovated with very comfortable queen sized beds and nice linens. The norm for Disney is full size, so this is a nice perk. There is also flat screen tv, table & chairs, mini frig, coffee maker, iron/ironing board and hairdryer. You can stroll to Riverside in less than 5 minutes on a well lit path along the Sassagoula River. There is also a running path about 1 mile round trip. Boating service is available to Downtown Disney and a couple of the bordering resorts...relaxing, scenic and a nice alternative to taking the bus. Our 10 year old daughter enjoyed the sea monster slide at the pool and the daily pool side activites. (her Dad and I liked the pool side bar!) She also looked forward to seeing the doormen, Arneil and Santos for coins to toss in the lobby's fountain. My tip...don't waste your money purchasing the refillable souvenier cups for $14.95 each.

Pool area was great - they had games there for kids during the day - but we were at the parks so didn't take advantage of the great pool and slide. The quick service restaurant (cafeteria style) had a good variety with a Louisiana flair. We had the Disney Dining Plan (standard), which I strongly recommend. Food prices are not cheap anywhere at WDW, and the Dining Plan saves you about 40% and encourages you to eat well, because its already paid for and you have a sit-down (or buffet) meal every day. Note: Make your reservations well in advance for the popular restaurants. We waited until the weekend before the trip and ended up planning the days around the reservations times that were still available.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - disney style!\u201d", "Author": "jes1969", "ReviewID": "UR117738596", "Content": "We stayed at the Port Orleans French Quarter over Thanksgiving. Check in was timely and we were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded (we didn't even have to ask) to a newly remodeled room in Building #7. We were the first family to stay in this room since the remodel. Biggest plus? the 2 queen size beds as opposed to the double beds found in most hotel rooms. As a family of 4, this was the best! Biggest downfall? after walking ALL day in Disney's amazing parks, walking to building #7 seemed like forever away. I believe all of the rooms have now been refurbished, so pick a building closer to the buses, cafe and especially if you purchase the drink mugs - nothing is worse than walking all that way for a drink that is gone before you even get back to your room. The pool and hot tub were nice - not spectacular - but nice. Besides, it's Disney and we spend most of our time at the parks. We can swim at home! We had fabulous service from the front desk and concierge - we had luggage that arrived from the airlines - completely destroyed - unusable for our trip home. Disney replaced our luggage, gave us fast passes because we had to take the time to solve this issue. One downfall - the 'check out' was an issue for us. We were told to be at the check out at a certain time, we arrived, the line was long, the staff was (new, I think) being trained and we ended up missing out bus to the airport. On Thanksgiving weekend, our concern was the security line being too long & us missing our flight. Again, the concierge to the rescue ... a cab was provided & paid for by Disney. Security was long but we made our flight.

The rest of the Disney transportation was reliable and relatively quick - never waited more than 15-20 minutes for transport anywhere, and it didn't seem to take more than 20ish minutes to get to any park.

A very relaxing ride that runs in good weather, (If it rains the water level in the river gets too high and the boats cannot get under the bridges safely) if not there is a bus that runs every half an hour or so.

The service was excellent and our rooms (we had a newly refurbished one) were beautiful. Extremely clean grounds and it captures the romance of New Orleans. We loved the fact that you could take a boat as transport to Downtown Disney which was so much more convenient and quick than the bus. When we did have to use buses (like for the Magic Kingdom), we never had to wait too long which was a huge plus with a toddler. The food was not anything to write home about but I think it is like that in the cafeteria setting of all the resorts. We loved the Scat Cats loung bar and the fact they had nice live music from Wed-Sat in the evening there. The pool and hot tub facilities were clean and convenient. French Quarter is a much quieter setting than Riverside but a short walk (or boat ride) to the area for walking and enjoying too. One small warning to those who stay there is that there is some construction going on but they really try to be courteous about the times that they are doing it. We were close to the contruction and it never once disturbed us or became too noisy in our room. They were testing the fire alarms 2 days of our stay from 11-2 but they gave us advanced warning the evening before via phone and we were out of our rooms while that was happening.

Also, we found that the woman who helped us book reservations at the concierge was a bit rude- which is VERY un-Disney. We were trying to book a reservation for a restaurant (basically any) for that evening. I know you are supposed to make advanced reservations, but we find that limiting. She acted like we had made the most crazy request and said it would be a \"long shot.\" I know they aren't supossed to give recommendations, but she really took that to a different level by not suggesting anything! When we found a place that had an open spot (it only took 2 tries, so not really a \"long shot\" by any means...), I asked if she knew if it would be a problem to split a meal (we hate getting two large meals that we can't eat and then just throwing it away, so we usually split and get dessert). Instead of just saying \"yes\" or \"I'm sure that would be okay,\" she said, \"What you do is your own business.\" Seriously?

You can get a better quality meal at Downtown Disney (just a short boat ride away) for less. We spent $40 for two chicken sandwiches and a portion of chicken fingers, again not good quality. We brought cereal for breakfast and bought milk in Jackson Square resort store, saved a lot of money as we had breakfast the first day and threw it away and it cost $30 for two adults and one six yr old. The pool is open very late, well after midnight it is clean and well attended. Warm towels are abundant poolside. For the smokers, there are many smoking areas well away from everyone else.

Upon being transferred to the hotel from the airport (via disney's magical express), we were greeted by an employee who walked up to my son and I as we were sitting on a bench in front of main entrance to hotel awaiting my folks to exit the bus. After greeting us, he asked us where we were from and when I told him, he immediately recognized our family names (he asked if we were the_____ and _____ families). He then escorted us to check in...... top notch service! Our rooms (adjoining) were on level one in building two... poolside. My parents had a corner room. Both rooms were perfect.... new interiors and beautifully decorated. There is a lovely curtain that can be pulled out to allow privacy in the sink and bathroom area from the rest of the room.. this came in handy. We were right next to the dock for the river taxi to downtown disney as well. Close to food court.... and obviously the pool. Perfect location! The pool is wonderful... I thought from the pictures, that there were two water slides... but there is actually only one. The other is a bridge that you can walk over the water on. The food court is satisfying and nice. Usual fair... sandwiches, chicken, pizza... great breakfast as well. I recommend that you buy the refillable cup available for purchase in the food court... a money saving tip. I washed the same and frequently refilled, even putting my a.m. coffee in the same. My only complaint was that the bus service to the parks was hit or miss. Some days we would show up and only wait for a minute. Other times we would wait for 30 plus minutes. There were times when we had to stand on the bus due to the crowds as well. But the boat ride down the river to downtown disney is beautiful and makes up for the bus! I couldn't believe how many bus stops are located around Port Orleans Riverside (4 or more?)... when the French Quarter is quaint enough to only need one. I highly recommend this resort. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! After we left the resort, we transferred directly to the Disney Cruise ship (Dream). Impeccable service in transfer from the resort. The cruise is another review.... BUT.... WOW... what an amazing ship.

We did not know that you could leave your luggage down in the storage room and call for them to bring it up until the day off we were leaving. Their food court is basically the same thing as the theme parks. Not much of a variety. The pizza was decent, not what we were expecting though. Their was a lady who worked at the resort and we asked her where were the buses for downtown Disney. and she replied in a attitude way \" you could take the bus but the boat is a lot funnier\" so we said okay where is the boat then and she pointed out the door. We couldn't check into our flight until the day off we were leaving because they close so early. They said my card was denied when their was money on it. We went to pull money out to pay for the baggage and they wouldn't take cash.I never thought someone would reject cash before. Buses be prepaid to make stops. We were n the french side and it said to Epcot. So we got on and expected to go to Epcot. We made stops to the river side along the way and missed our firework show because of it. Some will say heading to your resort name and they will take you to blizzard beach, typhoon lagoon and then your resort. Our cleaning lady cracked a glass in our room, and also cracked open a shampoo and conditioner and just left it in the cracked glass in our room. we were very upset about this because we didnt want to get charged. and why wouldn't she just take it out when she did it. We also kept the windows closed and when we got back she had opened them and didn't close them. we like our privacy we dont like people peeping in.

We had it on the news, radio Disney and that was all the channels that worked. we changed our hotel at the last minute and they never changed the name for it.

Perfect for what we needed it for\u2026Sleeping. There was Internet service available at a cost ($10 for 24 hours I think).

Housekeeping was fantastic came to our room every day with fresh towels, coffee making things and all the essentials. Linen was changed every couple of days. And all staff members were very friendly and helpful. We were seen straight away on arrival at reception and were given our room keys/keys to world which you add a card to it and you can just use your key to the world in all Disney areas for food/shopping. Also we found the system that you can purchase anything in the Disney parks and then collect it from the gift shop at the hotel later that day or next morning fantastic. It meant we didn\u2019t have to carry stuff around all day in the parks. There\u2019s free shuttle/boat service, which goes to any Disney Park and Downtown Disney. Stops at certain times at night though. Gives older children there own freedom. Magic hours was another amazing perk of staying in a Disney Park and was such a god send as its not as busy at night, gives you chance to go on any rides that are to busy through the day or if you missed a show. We only used the pool once, which was ok, decent enough size for a dip especially on the hot days, was also hard to find seats and bit crazy with kids but not a big problem. There\u2019s a big secure car park to leave your hired/own car with security at entrance checking you stay at the hotel.

We knew staying at a Deluxe Resort wouldn\u2019t be possible for this challenge\u2019s parameters so we began researching moderate resorts. My daughter & I had planned a bayou birthday bash for her 4th birthday to be \u201chosted\u201d by Tiana (the story was that Princess Tiana was inviting all of her princess friends to New Orleans to celebrate my daughter\u2019s day this way we could include all of our fave princesses).

Anyhow, we had had New Orleans on our minds from the music to the beignets to the \u201cpardi gras\u201d vibe. It made our resort decision narrow down much quicker for sure. We loved the look of Port Orleans French Quarter Resort in pictures & we especially loved the pool. Room renovations for POFQ occured in 2011 & sometime in 2012 \"Royal Guest Rooms\" will be offered with a new theme. There is even talk Tiana might walk around at some point, an idea we thought would be great when we were there!http://www.land.allears.net/blogs/allearsteam/2011/05/newrenovated_rooms_at_port_orl.html Our kids\u2019 were 2.5 & newly 4 at the time of our trip. The September before when we traveled to WDW with extended family, we were spoiled by having the monorail at Grand Floridian so we could easily get on and off without breaking both strollers down (see my previous review). We were most worried about traveling to the parks. We were scared the busses would make us wait or be extremely crowded or difficult to navigate with two such small children & all of the gear we are required to take for them. But we thought it would be easier to attempt this with just the 4 of us & not the 8 that we would normally be traveling with. This trip we arrived to the resort by 1:00pm via Magical Express from MCO, we decided to dump our bags & head straight to the Magic Kingdom for lunch. We had checked-in on-line so our packet and keys were ready for us & we were actually able to go to our room even though we were early. The cast member told us that because we had two small children we were on the 1st floor. I was extremely grateful as there are no elevators & we had strollers in tow as well. The music was festive & the atmosphere was very reminiscent of the French Quarter; that is if the French Quarter were sanitized Disney style! Our room was a pleasant surprise. We had braced ourselves to be completely disappointed if we compared our accommodations to those we had the previous year at GF but Port Orleans French Quarter held its own. There were two double beds, d\u00e9cor was Southern style, a fridge, a tv, an area that could be curtained off with sinks, an open closet, safe, iron, ironing board & then the bathtub & toilet were enclosed next to it. We had a window & a table & were quite comfortable. If you have 5 guests you will need to stay at Riverside because FQ doesn't have a fold-out couch or bed to accomodate this. There is also a bench which we found handy for our suitcases & to slip our shoes underneath. We bring nightlights with us but we could leave a light on behind the curtain if we had to (little people that are newly potty trained can be scared at night). On our previous trip I had mailed food & baby supplies to us but we were able to carry things like snacks, juices & cereals with us on this trip and it came in handy as we stuck with the free Basic Dining & didn\u2019t upgrade. We had no problems getting our ADRs even though we were less than 30 days out when we booked them (we were only not able to get into Chef Mickey\u2019s out of all of our choices). Plus we no longer had a need for any diapers! Yeah!!! I had been very thorough in what to pack on the trip, to the parks, etc. as the trip back to the resort would not just be a quick monorail ride if something were forgotten. We waited less than 15 minutes for busses on average (the max wait time we ever had at Port Orleans New Orleans was 25 minutes & we only ever made one pick up at Riverside). We were quite relieved that the transportation wasn't drastically worse going from Deluxe to Moderate. There isn't a sit down restaurant on the premises so if you'd like to dine at the resort you will have to take the scenic walk on the Sassagoula River Path over to Riverside for Boatwright's. We found the food at Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory to be as good as Gasparilla Food & Games at Grand Floridian if not a touch better. However the Mardi Gras sized float heads hanging from the ceiling are a tiny disconcerting! Beignets are offered at Sassagoulas! A must-try. One evening we grabbed a hot pizza for the room at Pizza Express. The game room was more than adequate if not a bit expensive as they all tend to be. We had a tragic stroller accident but we were able to replace it at Jackson Square the store on site. We could've waited until we got to the park as they are available there as well but we chose to have it with us. You can buy souvenirs, postcards, stamps, snacks, film, etc at Jackson Square. There are lots of activities on the grounds you can take advantage of including bike rentals, the marina, surrey bikes, cane pole fishing, horse drawn carriage rides, etc. You can also take a quick boatride to Downtown Disney from FQ. Also check out Scat Cat's to enjoy a drink & live music off the lobby next to Sassagoula's. I mentioned Doubloon Lagoon the awesome pool at FQ with the Mardi Gras Dragon slide featuring King Triton & the alligator fountains. There's also a jacuzzi near the pool that stays open until 2:00am. The differences I noticed from Deluxe Resort to Moderate were all those you are likely aware of when booking. The toiletries are a bit different, at the time the decor a bit dated, the sheets & comforter slightly less comfortable, not as many dining choices, etc. The size of the room in the moderate was smaller, there wasn't a couch etc. But there is pizza delivery at the moderate resorts which deluxe resorts don't have. Also moderate resorts have a bigger & nicer laundry facility which I always try to take advantage of while on vacation. FQ's is near the pool so I was able to visit with my family while I did laundry to have clean clothes to take home. At GF my mom stayed behind one morning and finished it up for us & there were only 2 machines in the builiding (but they were in our guest building so not far to carry). I look forward to our trip this year to the Polynesian & checking out some of the Christmas decorations! Of course I will give you a review when I get back. Until then, if you have any questions about this review or resort - just ask!

My family took our first Disney trip in Sept 2010 and were very happy we chose the French Quarter. I was overwhelmed with the choices when planning our first trip and did a lot of research on my own. The main reason I chose the French Quarter was the size of the resort. Of all the moderate choices I believe it is the smallest. I am not a \"big resort\" kind of traveler and preferred the charm and quaint feeling of the French Quarter. Although there are many buildings on the property it never seemed crowded. As we strolled the brick streets, enjoyed the pool, visited the restaurant and lobby if felt a world away from the hustle and bustle of the parks. We also enjoyed being able to take the boat between the property and downtown area. As we traveled around on the Disney transportation system I was surprised how many stops some of the other resorts had and the size of them compared to the French Quarter. The room itself was clean and adequate (there are 3 in my family), typical hotel size and could have used some updates but we didn't go to Disney to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. I understand they are planning some room updates soon. The rooms could be improved but the grounds of the property were beautiful, charming and clean. I also felt secure while walking around which was one concern I had. We had a very nice 1st trip and if we return would definitely stay at the French Quarter again.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kennebunkport, ME", "Title": "\u201cLove love love POFQ\u201d", "Author": "3GirlsandaBoy", "ReviewID": "UR113180282", "Content": "I love POFQ for so many reasons.

The rooms are comfortable and clean, with plenty of space. I was in a standard room, overlooking a parking lot. The noise the first night was pretty bad. I believe this was only because of the room renovations that were still being done. However, on our second night, as I was tucking my son into bed, we heard popping noises outside. I looked out the window to find that we had a perfect view of the fireworks! What a wonderful surprise! Suddenly, that parking lot view wasn't so bad!! The pool at POFQ is great. The slide is a lot of fun for kids, and was never crowded at all. The boat over to Downtown Disney is a relaxing 20 minute ride. The food court is good, (and serves delicious beignets!) but can get VERY crowded in the morning. The only problem we had during our 9 day stay was that our refrigerator stopped working. I had a lot of food in there, and didn't realize that the fridge had stopped working until it was too late (my food had spoiled). I would've thought they would have reimbursed me for at least some of the food, but when I went to the concierge desk, they were actually quite rude.

With the free dining plan promotion, however, upgrading to a moderate level resort also included a dining plan upgrade from all counter service meals to 1 counter service/ 1 table service meal, so we went ahead and took the plunge and won't go back! We loved Port Orleans. All the rooms have been recently renovated to include 2 queen sized beds (doubles are standard at Disney Value and Moderate resorts, except for Coronado Springs. Port Orleans Riverside is in the process of renovating their rooms as well so some of them are queens while some are doubles). For those people used to staying off property, you have to understand that you can probably get nicer rooms for the same price with competitive off property deals, BUT it is hard to beat Disney transport, extra magic hours, and in our case free dining! We felt, however, that these rooms were fine for our needs. For those people in our position--debating whether or not to upgrade from the value resorts, here are the primary differences: queen beds! fridge in room. double sinks. nicer furnishings/carpets/linens/etc. bathrooms pretty much the same. coffee pot with real coffee in the rooms. pool has water slide/fountains. quieter. Port Orleans French Quarter in particular had several additional perks. First, like Riverside, it has access to Downtown Disney via boat, which we loved. I enjoyed how small it felt and because of the small size we never had any problems getting seats on buses and boats. The trade off is that it has less amenities (carriage rides, boat rental, etc.) than Riverside BUT you can take the boat or walk to Riverside to use these if you want. It also had a smaller dining area with less offerings than Riverside--that was the only downside I could see between the two. Otherwise, the pool was about the same size--with a third as many people--and the boats and buses came as often--with as third as many people (and, in the case of the buses, a third as many stops). Soo.... Pros: on property with usual perks, queen beds and fridge, very quiet, pretty, on the river/boat access, bus transportation was great, clean, friendly, fun pool, compact Cons: not as many amenities as Riverside, fewer dining hall offerings If you are thinking about a Disney Moderate Resort, this was a good choice.

It was wonderfully convenient to be able to take the river taxi between the two Riverside resorts and Downtown Disney. We also ate dinner at the full service restaurant at Riverside. Service and the food were both fantastic. Concierge desk was friendly and helpful with tickets, as was the airline check in upon departure. Overall, I would recommend this resort. We would probably stay at Riverside next time, simply because there are more pool choices as well as boat rentals.

We had trouble when we checked in as our park tickets had been issued wrond with Disney through our tour operator but after explaining to the concierge she rang our tour operator for us to confirm our correct tickets and then issued us with the correct ones. Our room was very clean and we had a king room which was a good size although I think if we had travelled with children having two double beds in a room that size would probably be a little tight. A good tip we picked up before we left was to leave a small tip for mousekeeping (housekeeping) each day rather than a larger one at the end of the day. They were very good and respectful if you put your privacy tag in the door.

The dining hall was okay:it is what it is! It can get very loud inside. The food is okay, as are the selections. The refillable mugs ($13.99) are good value, and we used them a lot. The staff at this hotel were wonderful also. We loved the entire atmosphere and experience; the fact that it was very hot and humid, really added to the \"New Orleans\" feel of the entire place.

My sister and I love Disney and have been 10 times/ we have stayed three times at the french quarter and walked around to see what rooms to request next time we come back- If you want a good view of the pool and to be close to the elevators and the boat that goes to downdown disney- request room number 2333 or 2334( 2334 is a corner room These rooms are a little bigger) this is on the top floor which is the 3rd floor and overlooks the pool with the elevator right around the corner- also a very good room is right straight across the pool area in building 5 with an even better pool view request room 5315 o 5316 you cannot go wrong with any of these rooms if your want a good view of the pool/close access to elevators and ice and downtown disney boat. Also if you want a water view and to be close to the elevators/pool request room # 2331 or 2332. The elevators are located on only one end of the building so hence the reference about being close to the elevators-all these room numbers are close to the food court- Disney will try to make your requests come true- so when you book your stay make sure your room number request is on the reservations. Tell them the number of the room plus - building 2 or building 5 facing the pool- so if you do not get the exact room number you want- you will get one close to it. If you do not request anything you might be facing the parking lot or a room a good distance from the main area of the food court, pool and boat. loved it and can't wait to go back next year!!!!", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect Moderate resort in Disney World\u201d", "Author": "klytia", "ReviewID": "UR109843909", "Content": "If you can't quite afford a Deluxe resort (Beach Club is definitely my pick there), have no fear!

We had debated for a while between this resort and other non-Disney resorts, and are SO glad we went with French Quarter. When I booked the room back in February, I requested a renovated building, and a week before departure called to see if they could arrange a river view, as well. I didn't have my hopes up because usually you have to pay for that upgrade, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that our room was in a secluded corner of a beautifully renovated building with a wonderful view of the river. We enjoyed watching the river boat going to and from Downtown Disney (and was also a very convenient and unique way to travel to this area). Other reviewers seem to acknowledge that some of the farther buildings are quite a hike from the main entrance of the resort, but we didn't mind the distance at all. The service was exceptional, and all of the staff at the resort were so friendly and helpful. The decor and atmosphere was perfect for an adults-only vacation; the New Orleans feel was authentic and tasteful, but not overdone, and not overly \"Disney\", which was exactly what we were looking for. The pool was also an enjoyable way to relax after a long day at the parks. The food court selection was adequate, but we didn't eat there aside from breakfast and to sample the beignets (a must!). The live music at night was a great touch, and we loved having the \"mayor\" of New Orleans greet us each morning as we left for the parks- he was so cheerful and really was a great start to our day.

We have stayed at several other Disney resorts in the past (Floridian and Wilderness Lodge to name a couple) but we would rank Port Orleans to be our hands down favorite! We checked-in online before arrival which was smooth and problem free. Pros: We had reserved a King bed room in our original reservation. When we arrived at the resort around 3:30pm, we asked the check-in staff if they had any river view King rooms available. They did and upgraded us without additional charge. We were in Building 1 (the building furthest south on the property) in room 1332. It was a corner room which meant that it also had windows on two sides of the room making it much brighter, and the view was superb. It was quiet and we could watch the sun come up over the trees in the morning. While we were the furthest building south on the complex, it was still only a 2 minute walk to the pool and a 4 minute walk to the main building with the food court and gift shop. It was about a 5-7 minute walk to the bus stop, but easy and picturesque. If you are a couple on honeymoon, anniversary or romantic getaway - building 1 is fabulous. We never heard any other guest, and since we were on the 3rd floor, never heard any of the loud toilets that so many others have commented on. The renovated rooms were lovely, and we found the beds to be extremely comfortable. Our mousekeeper (Juana) created different towel animals for us each day of our stay, and made our room immaculate! The first day we had a towel mickey on the bed waiting to welcome us, the second day 2 swans, the third day to baby elephants, the fourth day two love birds and the final day a cute little clutch purse decorated with confetti stickers. We did tip her $5 a day for mousekeeping (leaving $10 on the day we checked out), which was beyond worth it to come back to an amazing room and a little treat after 12-14 hour days at the parks. We walked over to Riverside several times during our stay. It was probably a 15 minute walk door to door since we always took time to fill our refillable mugs on the way over. The river path between the two resorts is lovely and a nice way to unwind after a day at the parks. We took advantage of the refilling option for drinks at both resort Food Courts, so we made sure that we never got dehydrated during our stay. It was also one of the few places that had Sprite Zero as a non-calorie option in the carbonated drink section. We ate dinner at Boatwrights the first night we were there. Jenny was our waitress and she was just lovely! Helpful, friendly and quick to refill a drink that was running low. We would highly recommend the crawfish appetizer (delicious!), barbeque shrimp appetizer (yum!) the blackened fish main course (nice heat to it), and the bread pudding! The bananas foster angel food cake dessert was good too, but couldn't hold a candle to the bread pudding. The gift shop at French Quarter was decent but nothing special. I didn't get a chance to check out Riverside's gift shop, but we ended up buying most of our souvenirs at the Floridian and in the actual parks. There were a couple of pairs of very cute Mardi Gras themed Mickey ears you could purchase at the gift shop, and a large swath of Princess and the Frog merchandise. We also took advantage of the boats that travelled between Port Orleans and Downtown Disney several times. Each boat can accommodate approximately 32-36 passengers, and that number is split between Riverside and French Quarter guests. So, if you pick the boat up at Riverside to go to Downtown Disney, the captain will only allow up to 24 people at Riverside to board at one time so that they can board at least 12 people from French Quarter on the ride to Downtown Disney. And vice versa. We never waited for more than 15 minutes for a boat, even when it was peak times in the evening when tons of people were waiting to go the Downtown Disney. The boat captains were uniformly friendly, and some of them were extremely knowledgable regarding the flora and fauna along the river as well as the wildlife to be seen. The boats stop running at 11:30pm but as long as you are on the Downtown Disney dock by 11:30 - they will make sure a boat takes every passenger there home. They trip to downtown disney takes about 20 minutes from French Quarter, 25 from Riverside. Downtown Disney has a very nice AMC theatre now, so we got to see some new releases in the evening that my husband wanted to see. Theatre has IMAX and enhanced THX which were great! The pool at French Quarter was lovely, big enough to accommodate all the people there without ever feeling too crowded. The slide was super fun, and there were plenty of sun loungers and towels. Pool bathrooms clean and comfortable. Pool bar had very yummy frozen drinks (if you like that sort of drink). I can highly recommend the Pina CoLAVAs. Pina Colada with Raspberry Coulis (oh my goodness, delicious!). There is also a very cute little playground near the entrance of the French Quarter pool, but is geared toward younger children (under 10) I would say. We didn't eat at the French Quarter food court all that often because we were on the Disney Deluxe Food Plan (it doesn't make sense to use the credits on quick serve meals on that plan). However, we did enjoy the beignets almost every morning before heading out to the parks. Those beignets are amazing! And a half order (3 beignets) are equal to a snack credit on the dining plan. Big enough for two people who prefer a light breakfast. You will not regret ordering those when you stay at French Quarter. Buses came very regularly to French Quarter. We waited (at most) 15 minutes for a bus to arrive. And the only time the buses also went to Riverside before going on the the final destination was when it was before 7:30 in the morning. Otherwise, the buses went immediately to the final destination. Drivers super friendly, but also sticklers to families with strollers (making them collapse all strollers before entering the buses). It never took longer than 35 minutes to reach any park from the French Quarter and the buses were reasonably comfortable. Cons: The only con we could really point to as that our room's shower faucet was very weak. Which we decided didn't matter all that much because everything else was amazing! And I think it is a problem with that specific room's shower faucet, not an issue resort wide. If we had been in the room more often/longer, we would have asked to have it fixed while we were there, but we were too busy for that to bother us. And every other part of that room was a perfect 10, so we shrugged our shoulders and had a fabulous time! The other slight con (and it is slight) is that the concierge service can take some time because they only ever have 1 person at the concierge desk. It just means you might wait 10-15 minutes if you want to talk to the concierge, so it really isn't a huge issue, just make sure you plan the time. The concierge took his time with each guest making sure they had everything they needed before they were finished, so just be patient. Rudolph was very nice and helpful! I would highly recommend French Quarter to couples visiting Disney. I also think it would be fantastic for families whose children were old enough not to need a nap in the middle of the day because it is a distance away from most parks and isn't the most efficient transportation (due to it being on the bus system rather than the monorail). Rooms were lovely, affordable, and larger than I expected. Service was excellent and friendly.

Total peace and quiet the second you step of the bus. A nice peaceful walk to our room to have a nice relaxing nights sleep in the queen size beds or take the kids to the pool for a swim before bed. Our kids liked the resort pool even more than Blizzard Beach. If you don't like waiting for the bus to and from the parks this is also a great quality of the French Quarter, we only had to wait for a 2nd bus once in the 5 days we were there, our longest wait was about 23 minutes which in my opinion was just fine after seeing the enormous lines for the other resorts.

The room had a good sized fridge, useful for keeping milk, fruit etc for breakfast when you want to make a quick break for the parks, and a good coffee maker.

It was also a short bus ride to Epcot, which was the only park we visited on our one-night stay. A big plus was that when the park closed, there was a specific bus that just took guests from the French Quarter back with no other stops (unlike the ride TO the park). The rooms were just ok - it reminded me of a regular Days Inn, but with kitchy Mardi Gras decor. It was clean enough, though, and just right if you don't really need a fancy hotel. We didn't use the pool area, arcade, shop, or either of the restaurants (the main one looked like an overgrown cafeteria), but it seemed like it catered to a wide variety of visitors.

I trip to the front desk and moments later we had new keys with a smile from the desk clerk (guess that's not the first time they heard that story). Any questions we had they had the answer or directed us to who did. There is a nice gift shop and yummy self serve restaurant that's open till 11pm nightly. And let me just say, don't forget to try the beignets that are fresh made while you wait!!!! Prices were reasonable (for Disney that is) and there is plenty of seating. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. There is a really nice pool for the kids as well as a snack bar out by the pool. The river boats run from the French Qtr side to the Riverside as well as to Dwtn Disney every 10 minutes or so, ending with the last boat from downtown back to the resort at 11:30pm. If you want to stay out later then you'll have to catch a bus back. On the Riverside you can book a carriage ride ($45), rent a mini speed boat ($35) and several other fun things, and there are several restaurants on that side as well. You can catch one of many buses that drop off & pick up every 10 mins or so to any of the Disney properties. But be warned it will take you twice as long to get there because they go to all the bus stops on the property and then to more than one destination to drop off. For example to get to the Animal Kingdom we first had to go to one of the water parks and drop off people before heading to our park, same thing when your coming back. And be prepared you might have to stand for the trip, they really pack you in on these buses. After 2 days of that we opted to drive ourselves because your room key gets you '\"free\" (yes free) parking at any park. Our room was very nice and clean with ample room for the 2 of us. It includes a mini frig for keeping cold drinks or whatever you please in. There is high speed but it is $9.99 for 24 hrs. Our room had a king bed which was very comfortable and a river view. Everyday we had new little wash cloth animals holding things like our coffee cups and of course fresh Micky Mouse soap & shampoo!

The resort is extremely well kept and the rooms are in much better condition than other like hotels in the moderate range such as Caribbean Beach or Coronado Springs. Building 3 is currently closed for renovations which made parking a bit of a hassle. Disney has relinquished much of the lots that best serve buildings 3 and 2 to contractors and their endless rows of vehicles, dumpsters and debris piles. We stayed in Building 2 (riverside view and caddy corner to the pool which was fabulous!) so lugging of junk was a pain but the room was worth it. We had a view if the Sassagoula River and could just about see the pool but this was a quieter spot for us given the upheaval in Building 3. The pool was great. Nice and warm and my kids loved the waterslide. There is a hot tub on the back side of the pool bar which was great in the morning before the sun hit the pool. There is a small playground which was also nice. Food at the food court was interesting. With the Mardi Gras - French Quarter theme there were items such as jambalaya (not bad), ribs/chicken (ok), beignets (great!) and I loved the Angus Creole Burger with shrimp. There were plenty of other choices as well. The river taxi was nice. They run small riverboats to Downtown Disney (15 min ride) which was a nice alternative to the buses and they also run to Port Orleans Riverside. Being able to see the Saratoga Springs Treetop Villas from the water brought back memories of when we stayed there a year ago. The DTD water taxi runs right to RainForest Cafe which is a good choice for lunch. The room quality was a pleasant surprise. It was evident that our room had recently been remodeled and everything was clean, fresh and perfect. My only complaint was the thin walls and the gap underneath the connecting doors. Our neighbors were a college-aged couple and there was alot of action going on in the room very late at night. Thankfully my kids were exhausted by bedtime so they didn't notice.

I have to start by saying this is the first time I've stayed at a Disney resort, typically we stay off resort. What a great experience, I'm now hooked. We used the Magical express and at first I was a little nervous leaving my luggage for someone else to get but sure enough it arrived shortly after we did. At check in, I requested a renovated room and they had one left in building 7, over looking the river, they gave it to us at no extra charge! The mattresses are brand new (I found a tag on one of the beds saying it was delivered Nov. 2010) and everything was clean. The beds were a bit on the firm side but I still had a great sleep. I wont spoil the surprise but there are hidden mickey's in the bed spread and shower curtain..... The resort it's self is smaller compared to the other ones and you can easily walk from one end to another. Building 4 has been done and on our last day it looks like people were being checked in and they've started working on building 5. I couldn't believe it, it looks like they were pretty much gutting some of the rooms. Two of the rooms they took down part of the wall and you could see they were taking out the tub. On the second night of being in Disney I started to get a migrain, it was just after 11pm and the Jackson Square had just closed as we arrived from the Magic Kingdom (odd, I couldn't find any asprin in the parks). I knocked on the window hoping they would let me in. Even though they didn't have to, they quickly let me in to grab asprin. What customer service! For 3 out of the 5 mornings we had breakfast at the Sassagoula Food Court. The waffles with berries was so good. We booked in December when the Dining plan was offered for free. What a savings! I don't like fast food and am a bit of a picky eater. Having the dining plan allowed us to eat at some fantastic places with out costing me a fortune (chef mickey's Breakfast with tip for just my daughter and I would have been $70! Because of the dining plan, we just paid the tip......). Even if I had to pay for the dining plan I would certainly get it. We didn't really snack and used the credits towards rice crispy treats and those big lolly pops to bring back as souvenirs. The best advice I got from tripadvisor is ask whats included. Some restaurants had smoothies included (coral reef) and others didn't. The dining plan ended up being a lot of food. My daughter who just turned 10 was considered an adult and ordered off the adult menu. She would have been content ordering off the kids menu but it was a bit of a novalty at first to be considered an adult. We both tried to eat some of the most expensive entrees (lol, a couple of times I was trying to get her to order the steak instead of pasta)when we used the dining plan but by the last day all she wanted was the kids chicken fingers. Only disappointment we had which really is nothing, I've seen pictures on trip advisor of all of these neat towel foldings left behind on the bed from the cleaning staff. We got a mickey on arrival but didn't see anything after(I still left a tip each morning, room was nice and cleaned)....again really not a complaint and didn't change my view or experience. For the buses we didn't have to wait longer then 10 mintues with the exception of the early morning bus taking you to magic Kingdom for the Chef Mickey breakfast. The front desk told me to be at the stop at 6:20 and the bus didn't come until 6:45am....no worries we still got there early. Lastly, Magic Hours in the parks are so worth it. Having the extra time allowed us to just walk onto the most popular rides and in the afternoon when the park was the busiest my daughter and I would go back to the resort and rest. When it slowed down we would go right back.

I was in Orlando for a conference earlier in the week and my husband came to join me from Thursday night - Sunday afternoon. We asked for an updated room and got building 7. We were told that building 6 was also renovated (and slightly closer to the main lobby, buses, etc.) and they were in the process of renovating building 4 - so if you are reading this some months later, building 4 is probably a safe bet as well. We booked through a travel agent online and she was able to get us the Disney Dining plan for free (something the Disney website didn't offer). I loved the decor of this hotel - very colorful on the outside and the rooms were clean, modern, and warm. We ate in the dining hall/food court area several times with no complaints - everyone seems to know about the dining plan and can tell you what you get. Get there early for breakfast or finding a place to sit could be difficult. If you are on the basic plan, I would pay for breakfast and use your quick service meal credit for lunch and your table service meal credit for dinner to make the most of it. If you are planning on nice meals (particularly in EPCOT) make reservations online or through your travel agent far in advance or you will be waiting forever, even in the slow months. The only downside we saw here was that when the buses pick you up for certain parks at the Port Orleans stop, you then have to stop at all the bus stops for the Riverside part of the hotel (4 additional stops) before getting to the parks. In some cases it took over 45 minutes to get to Epcot, so plan on that taking some time. You may even want to grab a cab if you are short on time. Overall we were quite pleased and would choose this hotel again.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cStill a great resort after all these years!!\u201d", "Author": "BBE2", "ReviewID": "UR93738254", "Content": "Stayed at the French Quarter twice when my kids were \"kids\" back in the 90's. Loved it then but after reading all the negative reviews concerning lack of cleanliness, worn out rooms, etc was hesitant to book here again 10 years later. So I booked a 2 bed condo at Saratoga Springs and kept calling back to inquire about openings at the Boardwalk resort (either Villa or Inn). Meanwhile I checked rates at French Quarter and just couldn't justify the expense of the other two resorts when I found out that the French Quarter was so much more reasonably priced. Afterall, I figured we'd spend little time in the room and with the savings would be able to get tickets for Cirque and hop over to Universal for a day and see the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Also wanted to check out some of the pricier places for dining... So the French Quarter it was. We booked two rooms and I was amazed at how wonderful our stay there was...again. Details: Bldg 7 is completely renovated. Stayed in room 7348. King sized bed, overlooking Sassagoula River. Magnificent view not that I ever got to really sit there and look out the window. My kids stayed in 7301, slightly less expensive, two double beds, no real view to speak of but they could care less at 22 and 25; they were just happy Mom and Dad were taking them to Disney again. I had put in a request for bldg 7, and for the king room and the river view. Everything was honored by Disney. Delightfully surprised. Pros: Rooms were spotless, including the bathroom and tubs. Brand new everything. Beds were extremely comfortable. Lighting is excellent. Vanity area with two sinks was very roomy and both husband and myself could store all our toiletries without fighting over the space. Flat panel TV (again, never used it except to check the weather channel) In room fridge Thermostat control for temp Quiet and efficient ceiling fan Plenty of towels provided daily without asking for extras Cons: The WORST pillows I've ever laid my head on. Can't imagine what they were thinking when they ordered these for the new rooms. The good news is that you can request feather pillows, which we did and they were provided almost immediately. BYOBD Bring your own blow dryer. Also bring your own bathroom amenities. Disney provides soap and shampoo/conditioner minnies (no pun intended) only. And a word or two about that soap. Don't know what's up with the packaging but those wrappers are virtually impossible to open without a sharp knife. And to make matters worse, the two bars are replaced every day for reasons unknown, even if they were barely used. This is such a waste in addition to the torture of trying to open the package. Wall Safe is not. In this day and age why Disney would opt to place a keyed safe as opposed to a combination safe is puzzling to me. I would imagine there are many \"extra\" keys floating around so I never felt comfortable using the safe. Other comments about this resort, both good and bad: Bldg 7 is a distance, though not a great distance, from the lobby,Floatworks food factory, pool, and bus stop. Not an issue with older kids but I would imagine that for little ones this would be a hassle. We stayed in Bldg. 5 when the girls were little so we could be closer to the terrific pool they have there, but bldg 5 has yet to be refurbished. Bldge 6 is currently under construction and this is less of a walk to the things mentioned. Bus situation: It seems that the buses from French Quarter to the Parks no longer make those 4 stops at Riverside (AKA Dixie Landings the sister property). This was a delightful surprise. Even when the bus was virtually empty it went directly to the park. The only time we stopped at Riverside was when traveling to Downtown Disney but I would recommend the ferry boat for this anyway if it is available at the time you are traveling back. Buses were very prompt and we hardly waited most times we needed to travel. Staff was very responsive as far as addressing any concerns raised. Pillows were replaced almost immediately as mentioned. Our door handle was falling off when we checked in and this was also addressed almost immediately. One thing that hasn't changed though, is the less than accomodating attitude of the front desk staff. Do they train them to never smile or say a welcoming word? I recall being confounded by this in the past. Afterall, this is the hospitality industry ; why not be hospitable in attitude as well as action? But no matter. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

It could quite possibly be the best food court in Disney (better than the park food) with the beignets (absoultly delicious) and variertyvof lunch and dinner options.

While we did not get a renovated room (I've heard that they should have them all renovated by April or May 2011), we did have a lovely room in Building 2 not too far from the Food Court/main building. We loved the tree lined walking paths and the quaint, romantic ambiance. It truly is the romantic resort we were glad we had picked 11 years ago for part of our honeymoon. The kids loved the alligators playing instruments and all about the pool. It was entirely too cold for us to consider swimming while we were there, but the kids (8 and 6) both said it looked like it would be fun - especially the slide. Our room was clean and fresh smelling. There was a small area chipped on a tile in the bathroom, but I'm not ranking the hotel much lower because I know they are renovating soon :) I like that they give several to-go cups by the coffee maker instead of just 2 like some hotels do. It's convenient if you want both water, coffee, or to have the kids split a juice, etc. We ate at the Food Court and it was very good (review will be separate), though not excellent. I wish that they had just a little more variety as I'm sure if we had been here more than a 2-3 days like most people, we might have gotten bored with the menu. The beignets were wonderful though :) On my rating, I am putting that the hotel has a restaurant and room service, but please keep in mind that it's really a Food Court/Quick service restaurant and that room service is really just pizza delivery ;) We did LOVE Elliott Dyson (the jazz musician that they have some nights for free in the lobby) as he was fabulous. We must have stayed watching him for 2+ hours and it was one of the highlights of our trip. The Scat Cat Bar open to where he played is also nice. Dyson was absolutely wonderful with our kids and all of the kids that stopped by with their families. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and it was really beautiful, especially the lobby. It was one of the best decorated that we saw over the next 10 or so days (and we stayed at the Animal Kingdom, Beach Club, and Carribbean - we switch hotels a lot, lol). We are hoping to go back for one night (as we are DVC ;) ) in the near future so we can try out a newly renovated room and see Dyson again :) I am overall giving this a 5, even though it's more like a 4.5 with the rooms that need renovating.

We have a 2 1/2 year old and a 3 month old and we found the hotel to be very family-friendly, as you'd expect a Disney resort to be. The rooms were clean and nice. They put a pack n play in our room at our request for no extra charge. There is a food court that has a nice variety of food and there was a lady working there who would talk to my older child and make him laugh. She gave him a cookie with some icing and sprinkles to decorate, which made his day. There's also an arcade, which has games for elementary-aged kids through adults. My husband really enjoyed playing there as it has some older games from the 80s. Even though there were lots of kids in the hotel, we never heard a lot of noise. It might be because of where we were situated (building 5 along the back). But they did a good job making the walls thick and designing the walkways to minimize echo and noise. A tip for Disney with more than one very young child: Don't bring a double stroller. Even a tandem double stroller takes up alot of space and is bulky to get on and off the buses. We brought both a side by side double stroller and a single stroller since we drove to the hotel and had cargo space. We found that the single stroller was much better as the 2 year old wants to walk alot of the time. When he was really tired, we'd put him in and one of us would hold the infant. A baby bjorn or similar carrier would have been a good idea, too. There are buses that transport you to the parks, as there are from all Disney resorts.

The one pool at Riverside (with life guards, which is what I prefer) seems to be a bit of a walk from the rooms, the boat ride to Downtown disney is a must do, I've read reviews that some of the resorts are too big, French Quarter is the smallest of the Disney resorts, if you have small children or individuals that are disabled this is the resort for you.

Very impressive. We had three meals at the food court and I was pleased with all of my food. We even got a home cooked Thanksgiving meal on Thanksgiving day. It was awesome. Fifteen dollars for a huge tray of food. Tasted better then my families Thanksgiving cooking. I was very impressed with how professionally Disney runs things. All employees we encountered were friendly and courteous. The little touches mean a lot. The beautiful holiday decorations in the lobby were a great first sight when we got there. First thing when we walked into the food court a woman came up to the boys and offered them a free cookie decorating activity. I was fortunate enough to have a 40% off coupon for our room and I feel that we got our money's worth, and them some.", "Date": "December 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cRenovated Rooms and Nice Quiet Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Traveler2585", "ReviewID": "UR89163103", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here December 1-4th and it was a pleasant stay! We were quickly checked in upon arrival and given a Water View, Double Bed room in Building 7. The lobby area is small but this resort is the smallest in Disney so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Request a room in Building 7! This building is totally renovated (it\u2019s the first one done in their renovation project\u2026 currently they are working on building 6). The room was immaculate. We walked in and it just smelled new\u2026 the carpet was spotless, the beds had new comforters, sheets and pillows. The dressers were brand new and we had a LG flat screen TV and a brand new ceiling fan. The bathroom had a new tub and flooring as well. Overall, I have no complaints about the room because it was all new! I was expecting the worst after reading other reviews about mold and dust but this was such a treat. My husband noticed a tag on the mattress that said \u201cJuly 2010\u201d so we knew the mattress was new as well. The view from the room was lovely, as it overlooked the river. The room was also very quiet. We did hear some construction later in the morning going on at Building 6 but it didn\u2019t bother us as it was about 11am. The food is average, cafeteria style like you find at other Disney resorts. It got a bit crowded in the morning and the seating area would fill up. We ate over in the bar area for breakfast as there was no one sitting in there. From Wednesday to Sunday there is a \u201cScat Man\u201d performing right outside the lobby in the bar area. He\u2019s fun and drew a crowd! The pool area was clean. As it was in the 60s not many people were swimming but we did. It\u2019s a heated pool. The slide was fun! The resort could use an additional hot tub as the one by the playground was consistently full. A lot of families brought their children in the hot tub. The grounds of the hotel were immaculate. The great part about this resort is the boat to Downtown Disney. We utilized it many times throughout the trip and never had to wait more than 5 minutes for it to arrive and depart. It was about a 15 minute trip to Downtown. You can also take it to Riverside if you want to check out that monstrous resort. All of the staff was friendly and helpful. Since the resort is so small, you can walk across it in just minutes. It\u2019s nice that you don\u2019t have to walk 20 minutes to get to your room after a long day at the park! French Quarter is the first stop for the park buses. We didn\u2019t have to wait longer than 10 minutes for a bus. However, the bus does stop 4 times at Riverside so it can get packed and take a bit to get to the parks. Overall, we\u2019d definitely stay here again! We enjoyed the small, laidback atmosphere and the quiet of this hotel. It\u2019s a bit less \u201cDisney themed\u201d than other resorts but we didn\u2019t mind that at all.

This was the first moderate (vs. deluxe or vacation home) resort stay in nearly 7 years. We stayed at POFQ after a conference and chose this one as 1) work colleague had a 40% off pin, as it was her first Disney trip and 2) this is one of the resorts I had not yet stayed at. We were here Oct. 6-8, 2010. We arrived via rental car and I was shocked no one from BELL SERVICE greeted us upon arrival. I found a bellman in the Bell Services office just leaning against the door. This was NOT the type of service I was used to at Disney. They did quickly unload the bags and we left to turn in the rental car. We returned to the resort via the FERRYBOAT from Downtown Disney, which took about 15-20 min. We did Online Resort CHECK-IN, so our folder was ready for us when we returned around 1:30-2pm, at which time our room was ready (Thurs.) Check-in took about 3 minutes. We were in room 2147 - a building directly behind registration/shop, the 2nd room on the ground floor. Although I had stayed at the sister resort, Port Orleans-Riverside (formerly Dixie Landings) a few times, I hadn't realized how small and compact POFQ was! Our room was probably only about 100 ft. from the gift shop! I had requested a roll-away in advance, as we had 3 women in the room. They didn't have this request, but quickly added it at no cost! This saved me $45 ($15/night)! As I feared, the ROOM seemed somewhat dark, even with the blinds open. I was also aware this resort was about to go through an upgrade, and it (by Disney standards) needed it! Our room was a lovely blue, but the bathroom was a darker green and gold - ick! Disney is in the process of getting rid of the traditional \"bedspreads\" and to that we say - thank goodness! We also had a standard 19\"? tube TV. (The fall upgrade will switch this to a flat screen.) The most shocking thing was there was no mini-fridge in the cabinet, even though the cabinet was made for it! This was confusing. The room included the typical iron/ironing board, coffee maker with coffee, insufficient wall-mounted hair dryer, etc. The toilet was quieter than most Disney toilets. The ROLL-AWAY was a clean twin, but it was saggy! I felt like I was sleeping in a squishy ditch every night, even though I got used to it. The regular BEDS seemed nice & firm - just what I'd want. As for CLEANLINESS, I really don't have to mention it - it's Disney. Everything was clean. We were there early enough to hit the POOL the first day. We easily found both sun & shade behind the slide, but shady spots were few. It was noisy, as we were at the ladder & shoot part of the slide. Again, I was amazed how small the resort was, as our room was only about 150-200 ft? from the pool area! Towels were plenty and the water clean. All Disney pools are \"supposed\" to be heated, but it certainly didn't feel like this one was! Try the toe-dip test before jumping in! The GIFT SHOP was adequate. The FOOD COURT was adequate for the size of the resort, but it was too small of a space. You basically ran into other people when you turned around and at peak time the lines from the food stations and the registers ran into each other, leaving virtually no room to maneuver. Because of this one night we walked to Riverside for supper and our last morning, we brought the food back to the room instead of dealing with the crowded food court & noise. (Keep in mind this was not a busy season!) I wish there had been a \"check yourself out\" option! It was my BFF's BIRTHDAY. They noted this and left a Mickey b-day card and Photopass discount card for her. I knew to allocate necessary time for the BUSES to the parks (45min to 1hour for transport), but that wasn't necessary in Oct. Wait times were as expected 5-15 min. We only went to Magic Kingdom & EPCOT, and those took no more than about 35 min. max. I fully expected to share buses with Riverside. However, either per the season/our timings or just luck, we never had to share with Riverside! Yay! At closing of EPCOT (during Food & Wine Fest), we were also lucky to have a bus line of only about 10 people and got a bus within 10 min., which Riverside had 4-5 rows of the switchbacks filled. (I felt sorry for them.) To go home we used MAGICAL EXPRESS. Since we were so close, we took our bags to Bell Service instead of calling them. The bus was right on time. I was surprised how many people from our resort climbed on; we nearly filled the bus. So it was also surprising that we then also stopped at Old Key West and Saratoga Springs. (I know the buses usually make a few stops, but that bus was packed!) We were the 2nd stop at the airport and still arrived very early. I was hoping this stay at a moderate resort would \"reground\" me to staying at that level instead of the higher level resorts in the future. But like all things Disney, it only confirmed we like the best! After staying at deluxe/vacation club resorts and having stayed at all 4 moderate resorts, it will be incredibly hard for me to stay at a moderate again. POFQ was fine for this trip, as it was short and we spent most of the time running to the parks. POFQ would also be perfectly fine for those who have never stayed at Disney or not stayed at a higher level resort. (I remember when we loved the values resorts!) It would be great for those who don't want to walk distances. For me, I want the most from my Disney $ & time. So location is super important (close to more dining options & parks), and if I'm spending a day at the resort, I'd like more amenities/impressive environment. So for our 25th! Disney trip in Dec., I'll be back at a vacation club resort. Again, don't get me wrong, POFQ is perfectly fine; I've just gotten spoiled by the others!

The hotel is lovely the grounds are beautiful and the boat to Downtown Disney a big asset. The Transport system (buses) are great too never waited long to go to any park. the buses are clean , air conditioned and many drivers are great entertainment, Even singing happy birthday to our grandson on his birthday. Once your in Disney World it's hard to escape !! just because they make it s so easy to stay there. We were there a week before we relised that we hadn't been out or visited the Universal Parks!. The only thing I would say is hire a car even if only for a week of your stay as if you want to get 'out to universal or shopping the bus service is hard to find and a bit of a pain, so we got cabs which are around 30 dollars each way. Also the beds are surpising small (only 4 foot I think). Having visited America before was very surprised to find such small beds. We recommand Port Orleans French Quater to anyone especailly with the Disney dining plan which is brilliant and saved so much money , we left still having over 10 meals unused. Also the free refilable cup your given on arrival at the hotel is great , free hot and cold drinks for the entire stay at your hotel.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cReviewing just the hotel, not Walt Disney World or our trip, it's just average...\u201d", "Author": "theepp", "ReviewID": "UR85771877", "Content": "This review is going to try to focus on the property itself, rather than our overall vacation (great) and customer service (top-notch) experience which would have been the case regardless of where we chose to stay. I gave it three stars because at its price point, based on its \"moderate resort\" competition, it is only average. We have stayed at the Port Orleans Resort - French Quarter in the past, so long ago that it was simply called the Port Orleans and Riverside was called Dixie Landings. Because of that, we were confident that for our first family trip, this would be the place to stay. The front desk upgraded us to a river view room for not charge, as it was our annivesary....but that was after I asked, it wasn't volunteered. (for the record, I did not expect it to be, river view was not available when I booked, otherwise I would have reserved it) The first surprise was that it really had not changed much in the past 12 years. The double beds (we knew the size of the beds going into it, but what $175 per night hotel still has double beds?) felt like they had been there the past 12 years. The TV was an old 19\" 4:3 tube model. The decor both in the rooms and around the property, well you get the point. Everything was clean and well kept, but it really had more of a highway Comfort Inn that of a classically themed Disney hotel. On to the food...there are not a lot of dining facilities at French Quarter, as compared to other Disney resort hotels. There is no sit down restaurant, just cafeteria style, and the food there is mediocre, at best. The beignets were flat-out disgusting compared to those at Cafe du Monde in New Orleans and the french toast was consistently cold. Note that if you are on the dining plan and you want a sit down meal (i.e. waitress service), you will have to leave the property. Night life is minimal, which is probably good for families that turn in early. The bar is small, but it does the job if you want a nightcap before turning in. The live music was entertaining for a little while. Strolling around the grounds, they were nice and meticulously kept, as well as quiet. The pool area is nice, but, again, is falling behind the quality of the pools at other similarly priced properties on site. As an Epcot hotel, the location is excellent. Buses were relatively efficient, no more than about a 15 minute wait for the bus to any park. The boat to Downtown Disney is great and just outside your door. Transportation to the Magic Kingdom will take a little bit longer, something to consider if Magic Kingdom is your top priority. Would we stay here again, probably not. In reality, it really is just a place to lay your head, to recharge for the next day in the parks, but the aged decor and minimal services do not justify the price point. We would likely try Riverside (additional services, likely the same rooms & decor) or Coronado Springs (queen sized beds, newer resort & more amenities).", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nova Scotia, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome :)\u201d", "Author": "Kavo55", "ReviewID": "UR85295132", "Content": "We have been to Orlando five times and this was our first time staying on Disney.

The restaurant serves greasy junk food but breakfast is a must for Mickey mouse waffles. The decor is amazing. I visited Port Orleans Riverside.

The magical express service from the airport was very efficient and took about 30 minutes. The check-in was friendly and we found the resort was very pretty and tidy as you would expect from Disney. The room was a good size and overlooking the river as requested. The room appeared to have been decorated recently but the furniture and bathroom were a little worn and old fashioned, but there were lots of towels and toiletries and you just sleep there anyway. We took a kettle (we british need our tea) as you only get a coffee maker in the room, but there were no pottery cups or spoons, you just get paper cups so we would take mugs and spoons in future. The Sassagoula Floatworks was the food hall for this resort but the food hall at Riverside is only a five minute walk and was larger and had a slightly larger choice. We found the breakfasts were not very good value as a counter service on the dining plan so we used our snack allowance to get a muffin or a fruit cup for breakfast. It is better to use the counter service at the parks. We had lunch at Riverside once and it was very good, a pizza and pasta dish cooked to order with whatever ingredients we wanted. The music played at the resort started to get on our nerves a bit as it is the same over and over, in the food hall, outside the food hall and even around the pool. The bus service (every 20 minutes) was erratic and we often waited 30 to 40 minutes, and one time even 55 minutes! It always seemed to be worse when going back to the resport from the parks. Standing on the bus was the norm and we did sometimes worry about how safe this is. Also we don't think it is necessary to have music played on the bus, we just wanted a refuge from noise occasionally. The boat service to downtown disney was a bit slow, the wait was quite long and we actually gave up one day and didn't bother to go down there any more. We bought the resort mugs and we had about three drinks a day, so they were good value at about $28 for two for all our drinks for the whole stay. The maid service was very good and it was fun to see what shape the face flannels (wash cloths) would be each day. All in all it was a very enjoyable stay but we visited a few other resorts while there and we would go to Boardwalk another time as you can walk to Epcot and Hollywood Studios in about 5 to 10 minutes and it would save all the waiting around for buses. Also we ate at the bakery at Boardwalk and they did really nice sandwiches and cakes, and quite big so you could share one counter service meal between two.

Accompanied by a friend on her first visit to WDW, we arrived Sept 30th for a long weekend planning to do the Food & Wine Festival at Epcot. We did the online check-in and used Magical Express as well. Upon arrival, we strolled off the bus and were greeted by the doorman, dressed in a wild suit complete with sequins and complete with a huge feather on his glittery top hat. He gave us Mardi Gras beads and directed us to the concierge desk. Our room was ready even though it was just past noon. We were given our tickets , took a quick peek at the grounds and headed out to the park. We had to wait about 20 minutes for the bus & then stopped at ALL the Riverside stops as well so it took over 40 minutes to get to Epcot.. Buses are rare and wonderful things at this resort, we never seemed to time it right and some people were complaining loudly. I suppose this is what prompted CMs with clipboards and watches to appear in subsequent days. Even so, travel was always hit or miss. When we returned after Illuminations that night, it was a gorgeous peaceful walk to our building (number 1) and we had a view of the courtyard with a tinkling fountain. Our room number was 1343 and it was more than fine. Perfectly clean, towel Mickey on the bed. Bathroom was clean and no signs of mold, mildew, etc that other posters experienced. We had plenty of towels, soaps and shampoos. No dust anywhere and certainly no cobwebs. We breakfasted at the Sassagoula Floatworks Food Court the next morning and the food was hot and the area clean, we chose to eat outside and people-watch. The tables outdoors were clean as well and a CM roamed around periodically wiping tables as people finished. We walked to Riverside one evening to see Yee Haw Bob Jackson perform, what a terrific evening! It's only a few minutes to walk along the river and it is absolutely beautiful at night. When we returned, we had the first of many towel animals waiting, a butterfly on the edge of the sink. Too cute. Also, another comment to do with cleanliness, we had YeeHaw Bob autograph a picture and somehow I dropped it behind the dresser where the TV is located. Well, I tell you, that is some HEAVY furniture, it took 2 of us to scoot it out so we could retrieve Bob. There was no dust or crumbs, anything behind that dresser, I guess we had a supercalifragilistic Mousekeeper! The chairs by the little table had some scuffs but it wasn't like it was beat up or anything. I do agree, the rooms need updated but don't expect it to look like an Interstate Motel, it really is pretty and again, I stress- clean! We also took the boat to Downtown Disney one evening, we left at dusk and watched the lights come on at the resorts along the river, a really nice way to travel and it was the one transportation option that did not haul us around all the stops at Riverside before heading to our destination. Back to concierge, we stopped by on Saturday to pick up our tickets for the Spirit of Aloha Dinner Show and Gerry could not have been more helpful. All the staff here is very kind and seem genuinely concerned that you enjoy your stay. The next day, my friend checked her bank acct and found her credit card had been charged for the dinner tickets which were part of our dining plan. However, Joan, another concierge member remedied that in a jiffy and we were off to the parks again. Joan was really funny, this was a Sunday morning with a lot of people coming and going, some were pretty cranky but she kept her smile and cheery attitude through some rough moments. We commented on that and she laughed, said she understands people have been traveling and it's exhausting. She said concierge is usually the first Disney Cast Member people meet so they go out of their way to make it a good experience and set the tone for the rest of the stay. I thought that was great.

There is a quick service food court which has a good selection on offer and we always found the staff at the resort friendly and helpful at all times. The bus transportation was very good and the longest we waited was about 15 minutes. The theming of French Quarter is very well done and in keeping with the theme throughout except for the bedrooms! Another great aspect of this resort is the boat service to Downtown Disney. We found it such a lovely way to travel to and fro especially on warm nights. All in all I would recommend this resort if you can put up with the accomodation as it has so much going for it.

Rooms are as advertised, not real big but fine for a family of 4. Two double beds, refrigerator, two sinks and a bath. Curtain separates sinks from sleeping area. Rooms are clean and comfortable. As well, appeared very quiet. We never heard any noise at all from any other rooms. We also got a room near the main lobby, which made transportation and going to the pool very convenient.

A bit busy, but always able to find a table and never more than 10 minutes before we were eating. Transportation to and from parks were generally very good. Most mornings the bus went directly to the Theme Park and we were always there in less than 30 minutes including wait time. Only once did we need to also stop at all 3 Riverside stops before going to the park which was a longer trip. Evenings were fine as well except for after big evening shows, and then you needed to waited for 2-3 buses, but that is standard for most resorts. Location seemed pretty good. Very close to Epcot and not too far from any of the Parks. Service was fine ... prompt and friendly. We would go again to this resort and recommend for others. We have no other comparisons, but did enjoy our time at French Quarter. We also really enjoyed the convenience of staying on resort.

Rooms were neatly appointed and I believe that the rooms had been repainted not too long ago. AC was meat locker cold and wasn't noisy at all. Beds were comfortable.

Another nice perk. Bus service was available there too. The bus service to the parks was never longer than a 15 minute wait and a short walk from the room.

I thought that wouldnt be enough and we would need additional meals but we actually had over 40 snacks left at the end of the week (there were 6 of us) and used these to buy lots of sweets at the hotel shop to take home. Including all the free drinks it probably saved us about $250+ each day.

We were very close to the water taxi for downtown disney and just a walk between buildings for the pool. The food court seemed really expensive until you see the prices at other places and not so bad, lunch seemed the most expensive, dinner you got more for your money. Unless you drink alot of fluids, stay clear of the 14.00 refillable cup, this will add up if you have a decent size family, just go to the gift shop and buy a 2 litre of pop for 3.50 and use the mickey cups they supply you with and we had thermos that we kept the water in, refrigerators keep everything really cool. There is a small arcade enough to keep kids busy for a good hour, pool is decent, hot tub always busy but nice. Never wallked over to the other hotel, saw it enough from the shuttles. Shuttles usually always on regular schedule, except once when leaving Animal Kingdom the line was way back and when they finally did show up 2 came because of the size of the line. There are 2 bars, one inside and one by the pool very expensive can buy small bottles of liquor at gift shop for 18.00 but still cheaper than the bar. We packed 2 bottle of liquor in our suitcase and they went through fine. Make sure you get the locks approved by airports (they have pass keys that will open your locks without having them to cut your locks. We got ours at Walmart. You have the feel on New Orleans very pretty landscaping, all employees seem pretty nice, food court employees look tired and on their last nerve, but everyone else super nice. We always got our food to go, just ask for lids when you get your food and you are allowed to take the trays back to your room. Our room was very nice and quiet, we had the view of the back parking lot but still there was plenty of landscaping in front of it so you really didn't notice it that much. If you want scenery the fountain was right out by our front building with benches around it. We had room 1108 if interested. And finally if you are a stickler for not wanting noise or a lot of kids running around then you should choose french quarter instead of the riverside side.

Overall a great experience. As stated by most reviewers, some aspects of the resort are well liked by all (pool, river, boat to downtown Disney, service, etc.). Instead, I will comment on a few aspects of the resort that people seemed to disagree on. Room: Definitely a bit tired and a bit worn. Portorleans.org has info about a big renovation this fall, with themed rooms (princes and frog, and haunted mansion), with all new decor and flat screens. Very cool (here is a link, scroll down to see the pic's,http://www.portorleans.org/news.php). But the room was adequate as it was. We had no bed-bug-bites, and were not really concerned about not having a flat screen TV. If you intend to spend a lot of time on a TV, stay home. This is Disney! Go enjoy! Yes you can hear when the toilet above you flushes, but I didn't find it too loud, and it never woke me up. I found the rooms to be clean. Buses: Some have complained about the bus service, and I don't get that at all. We found the buses to be frequent, and never waited more than a few minutes. Most of the buses in the morning didn't go to the Riverside area, but the afternoon bus occasionally did. This added about 10 minutes to the ride. Even still, the total time on the bus to Animal Kingdom was about 25 minutes. Maybe less. I loved the bus service, and would stay onsite again just to access the transportation service. Food and Dining Plan: We loved the food for adults, especially for my wife who has Celiac disease. The food (really in all of Disney) was great, especially for the gluten-free crowd. The exception was the kids menu. It was always nuggets, hot dog, mac'n'cheese, and pizza. Not great. The best aspect of POFQ was the size. It is by far the smallest onsite property. This means less people at the pool and restaurant, less distance for short legs to walk, and less people waiting for the bus (we've been home two days and 5 bet there are still people standing in the line for the Pop Century!).

Well, when we arrived in the room, it looked OK. FIRST' THE BAD NEWS !!!! The kids wanted to watch TV and we search all over the room and did not find the remote so my husband went to front desk to get one and he was told to call so someone could come and bring us one. 10 minutes later someone came. We asked for bell service because we had so much luggage, anyway, we waited more than an hour and my husband had to call back after 45 minutes to know what was going on ??? 2 days later, while walking in the room, i saw something underneath the bed cover on the floor... a TV remote !!! So, we finally found it !!! For our entire stay, we had 2 TV remote but that's not all... We found also an empty water bottle and an empty bottle of Advil under one of the bed along with some used chewy bars foil paper... And under the second bed, we found a black tank top and some more chewy bars foil paper meaning that the cleaning staff dont clean under the beds !!!! I know they are not paid much but they should check the cleanliness of the rooms randomly. Clean Glasses were only given 3 times during our 7 nights stay. Also, you hear the toilet flush of other rooms nearby. We have tried to rest in the afternoon and we always hear the toilet of someone around flushing !!! 2 days before we left, I had like 3-4 bites on my right leg (mosquitoes ???). It was itching and a bit painful ??? I read a previous comment and the person mention BEDBUGS !!!! Was there really bed bugs in the bed ???? THE GOOD NEWS !!!! We were in building 7, third floor and we really appreciate it, it was more quiet. The friendly Disney's concierge when we arrived was very pleasant (Laurent of Toulon, France). Food court was never crowded and meals were affordable (at dinner) and tasty. THE POOL !!!! Kids really enjoyed the pool very much with the dragon's slide !!! Perfect after a day at the parks !!!! To be a REALLY moderate resort, DISNEY should consider this : UPDATING THE ROOMS by adding queen size beds, new bedding and LCD TV. Also, I found cheap that no wi-fi was provided free. It should be a nice addition to those rooms. For everything else, staff is helpful, pool is great, food court is OK, bus transportation is good but could be better because a bus every 20-30 minutes, if you missed it, the ait is a bit long and even if they see someone coming by, they wont stop so you have to wait for the other one 20-30 minutes later !!!!

The bathtub grout was also poorly applied and was also mildewed. The sinks were also poorly cleaned as there was gunk around the faucet and handles. The TV also had issues. Not what I would expect from a 3.5 star hotel. On our way to Orlando, we stayed at three hotels all of which would be considered 2 start hotels. All of those hotels had flat screen tvs and duvets of varying qualities. All except the last had new furniture and clean bathrooms. The furniture at the French Quarter had definitely seen better days. I don't have any complaints about the service which was excellent, although our housekeeper was a little sloppy. The pool is also excellent. My gripe is mainly that I paid extra for a moderate resort which should have had better quality bedding and bath than what we had.

Disney Magical Express: After landing at Orlando airport the Disney check in queue was very short mainly due to the time of night. Everything went very smoothly and within an hour of landing was at the reception desk checking in. The driver\u2019s English was very poor and it was difficult to understand the useful information he was telling us. When it was time to leave the bus returned me to the airport in plenty of time to catch the flight home. Check In: I had booked through the UK Disney web site. When I presented the various vouchers for the accommodation and park pass I was sent I had to provide my personal details again as the Disney web site is not compatible with the UK site. As I had booked through the UK site I was unable to book in on-line and my requests hadn\u2019t been passed on. Thankfully the very helpful cast member managed to sort everything out expect I was in building 6 rather than building 5 as requested and handed me my room card and information pack. The room card is also you park pass and you can charge everything you buy to it at the parks and have it delivered to your room. Room: I was in building 6 on the top floor overlooking the court yard which was only 2 minutes from the food hall, concierge desk, gift-shop and 3 minutes from the bus stop. The room was very comfortable with 2 double beds, fridge, coffee maker, in-room safe and plenty of storage space. The toilet flush is rather loud as is the a/c unit but you get used to it. I was never disturbed by any noise expect for the a/c unit the whole time. It was cleaned every day and was left several towel bunnies etc which I appreciated. Food Hall: The food was freshly prepared when you ordered it and was fine but the options are limited and never change. The refillable mug was handy as I had the Disney Quick (Counter) Service Dining Plan which was great but again limited your choices at the resort and parks. The queues at the register were reasonably quick even at the busiest times but you struggled to find a table at peak times. Frequently people never cleared the table or left dropped food so you had to clear their mess before you could sit down. Disney Transportation: I never waited more than 10 minutes for buses to any of the parks or downtown Disney. As mentioned before the buses expect for downtown Disney stop here first before going onto Riverside which has 4 stops unlike FQ which only has one so you always found a seat. The buses were clean and comfortable and the drivers informed you where to catch the return bus at each park and other information about the park. Sometimes the noise of understandably excited children and people talking made these announcements impossible to hear. After the firework shows at each park there were plenty of buses waiting so you never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes. You can also catch a ferry to downtown Disney and to the Riverside resort which are worth well catching. Concierge Desk: If you want to go to Sea World and Universal Studios the staff who are very helpful and friendly advised me to book a Mears shuttle which costs $20 return and you can specify the pick up and return times to suit your day. They were very happy to do this for me and it\u2019s best to arrange this the day before you want to go. I was also able to exchange my traveller\u2019s cheques here and book tickets for the amazing Cirque du Soleil at downtown Disney. Resort: The grounds are very beautiful and well maintained. I never used the pool which seemed popular going by the noise coming from it whenever I walked pass. The hot tub looked inviting but again I never used it. All the staff are friendly and approachable and seem to go that bit extra to make your stay enjoyable. The Riverside resort is only a 10 minute walk away along the river bank and you can catch the ferry to return. Unless you have a lap top you have to go to Disney Quest in downtown Disney to access the internet where it\u2019s free as there is no Wi-Fi access at all.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGross service, grosser rooms, worst hotel on Disney property!\u201d", "Author": "Avp415", "ReviewID": "UR74125465", "Content": "We stayed hear in April.

By the time we got it, the piece had significant damage to the matting and in general was mishandled. I called the front desk of the hotel to see what they could do to help and the lady was a bit rude and did not want to deal with this situation. Other than that, the stay was great.

The pool slide down the lizard tongue is gentle enough for 5-7 year olds to enjoy, and mine did thoroughly! I read somewhere that among Disney's mid-level resorts, this one has the best pool. Things to do at the resort: Swim in the fabulous pool, eat the fabulous food, take the boat to Downtown Disney or the P.O. Riverside Resort. They apparently have a horse and carriage ride too but it was rarely seen when we were there. Things to do nearby: Walk to the Port Orleans Riverside Resort and get your child's hair braided, go fishing there, or eat at their sit-down restaurant. Drive for literally ten minutes and you're at Typhoon Lagoon water park. Don't forget, you can take the Disney buses from the resort to any Disney theme park. No driving required. The 15 minute boat ride from the resort to Downtown Disney was nice, and the boat drivers really try to hype the other resorts you pass along the way. The river water is dark brown and murky, as expected in a Florida wetland. The boat drivers feel the need or were instructed to calm the fears of anyone from out of state who may feel uneasy about the dark brown color of the river water. Anyone who takes the boat to Downtown will remember the captains saying \"The dark brown water color you see is a natural result of tannins from leaves and tree roots, etc..etc... the same thing that colors your tea\" Ha Ha Overall it was a great resort. We stayed at Disney's Polynesian Resort for the last three years, and this was a totally different and much calmer, quiter atmosphere. Highly recommended all around.

We stayed there for three nights after spending one night at Coronado Springs. After carrying all of our bags from Coronado to French Quarter that first morning, we came to find out that our room wasn't ready yet. Not a problem, We stored our bags with front desk and left to go enjoy the parks during the day. When we came back tired from walking all day, our room was finally ready but they gave us 2 queen beds when we paid for a king bed. I had to drag our bags back to front desk and ask for a different room. After waiting, they sent us to a new room only to find out that it wasn't a water view room which I also paid for. I didn't feel like settling so I went back and demanded a water view room. After some fuss, we were finally given a room with our accomodations. The room didn't look as nice as our room at Coronado. The bedding seemed a littly tacky, there was no sliding door for the bathroom, and we didn't have a flat screen tv like at Coronado. All in all, we didn't plan to spend much time in the room anyway so we got over it pretty quickly. We checked out the pool and again, it was smaller and not as impressive as the Aztec pool at Coronado. Also the hot tub was small and always packed so we never had a chance to ride it. I did enjoy the decor and landscaping of French Quarter though. I loved waking up by the lake and then walking down cobble stone brick lanes through the resort. My girlfriend and I regretted not going on a carriage ride. It looked pretty fun and relaxing. I also appreciated that the resort was fairly small so it was never a long walk to get to where we wanted to go. The magical express buses were pretty convenient too and we never waited longer than 10 mins for a bus. The boat to downtown disney was pretty relaxing too. Mousekeeping was good. They kept our room nice and clean and left us a nice gift for our anniversary. I think I would have really enjoyed the hotel more if I didn't stay at Coronodo Springs the first night. I think that it's a much better moderate resort. However, French Quarter is a lot smaller which is better for getting to the pool, lobby, or bus services.

The luxury resorts were way too expensive and this seemed like the best moderate resort out there. The grounds were beautiful, loved the theme of the hotel. Very easy check in - took 2 minutes. Our room was not ready yet, but they texted us as soon as it was done and we already had our keys, so it was easy to go right to the room. We had asked for third floor, building 6, corner room and received all of our requests - room 6340. It was fantastic with a beautiful view of the river and windows on 2 sides. You do have to close them some times as people walk by with the external entrance, but the view was great. The pool was very nice as was the food court. We were also just a 5 minute walk from Riverside which had a sit down restaurant and a bigger food court as well. We were able to rent a pontoon to travel on the river as well. Being at the French Quarter provided us with relatively easy bus transportation to the parks (longest wait was 30 minutes for Downtown Disney one time). Most times wait was about 7 minutes. There is also boat transportation to Downtown Disney. Big advantage of French Quarter over Riverside is that the buses stop at French Quarter first before Riverside (if they stop there - sometimes they are direct to the parks and back). Staying at a Disney property allowed us to purchase items in Disney and have them shipped to our hotel which was a great service as well. We used the food court a lot and found it reasonably priced - I usually bought the child meal for myself and used the refillable soda mug often. It was annoying seeing other people use the soda fountains without a refillable mug (or old ones) as the fountain soda rule was not enforced. The hotel does need a little facelift in the rooms and especially the elevators (they were scary), but overall it was a very nice hotel and location and I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guadalajara, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cTotally happy\u201d", "Author": "nnimon", "ReviewID": "UR70332082", "Content": "I stayed at Port Orleans French quarter for 7 days and it was great.

This resort is still better than any of the value priced resorts. The faux French Quarter music got on my nerves after awhile at the cafeteria. It was the same two songs on a never ending loop. Rooms were clean. Mousekeeping made animal arrangements for our daughter each day to surprise us when we came back to the room. Very nice touch like only Disney can do. Important considerations: No full service restaurant. If you have the Dining Plan, this means you're hunting other places to use your full service meals. When you come here you will get hot and you will get tired and you will just want to sit down and have a decent meal with real coffee(not nescafe) without requiring a bus ride to a distant park and a walk in the heat for a 1/4 mile before you can sit down and eat. The Quick service diner was good, however occasionally you want a full dinner or breakfast instead of mickey shaped waffles. No Balcony = little privacy. Don't bother requesting water view for extra money, it isn't anything special. You just get a view of the narrow river from your small window which you'll keep closed most of the time anyway because of guests walking by the sidewalk outside your room.

Had no problems at all with the room. We asked for extra pillows, washcloths and towels and got them quickly. We got a towel Mickey only 1 day of our stay which was disappointing, but no big deal. The pool is WONDERFUL. There is a huge dragon slide where you actually slide down the dragon's tongue. My son loved it!

You can borrow a life jacket from the gift shop for the length of your stay for free. There is a poolside bar. The drinks were good but extremely overpriced. My husband and I each got a frozen drink and the total was $24.00. The Mardi Gras theme on the grounds is so nice. The plants and trees are beautiful and well maintained.

This resort felt like a friendly little community and was very restful after a long day at the parks you really felt like you were coming home. We had several meals in the food court, a great selection, reasonably priced and huge portions. I recommend buying the travel mugs with free refill. There is so much to say about the beauty and the setting. We had a surprise letter advising a bear (not Winnie the Pooh) had been seen in the area and for everyone to use caution. This did not dampen the holiday, just added to the excitement. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a Disney shuttle to the partk.

We used Disney's Magical Express to get from the airport to the resort, and the whole process was seamless right through check-in. Our room was small and basic, but since we were out of the room most of the time, this wasn't a concern. If you're looking for more luxurious room accommodations, this probably isn't the resort for you, but if you're not spending a lot of time in your room, and all you need are rooms that are clean and have basic amenities like television and a refrigerator, then this will work nicely. The resort itself evokes the feel of New Orleans' French Quarter, with the buildings having balconies, wrought iron fencing, and various gradens and reflecting pools around the property. As I understand it, this is the smallest Disney property. The food court had a decent selection of food, and service was reasonably fast. When we visited, the resort was fairly quiet, as it was the off-season and most kids were in school. We did not use the pool itself, but did spend quite a bit of time at the pool bar, where we found the staff to be very friendly. This resort is located very close to Downtown Disney, and was only a short water taxi ride down the Sassagoula River. The ride was only about 10 minutes long, and offers a nice change of pace from the more traditional shuttle bus system. Other Disney parks have a longer ride, but overall, I find Disney Transport to be very well run and convenient. The staff were mostly helpful, and was dissatisfield only in one minor instance. On the last day we took a short walk over to Port Orleans Riverside, and would like to stay there in the future. I would stay at French Quarter again, but I would like to try other Disney resorts before doing so.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warwick, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cA great time!\u201d", "Author": "Pinkgirl1977", "ReviewID": "UR66147453", "Content": "I decided to surprise my son with a trip to Disney.

We had a ball! This resort was located on the water and a has a boat that will pick you up and take you to Downtown Disney, which we really enjoyed. The benefits of staying on Disney is the shuttle service to and from the airport and how easy it was to get on a bus and go to whichever park you want to go. I have to mention that the Disney express shuttle from the airport, the line inside the airport is very, very long and my son and I made the mistake of walking the whole length of this line only to discover it was the line for the shuttle! So if you see a long line down the center of the airport just ask people what their standing there for to save yourself some time! Port Orleans hotel is very nice, the grounds are gorgeous and we enjoyed the pool. The pool was open till midnight which is great for when you get back from the parks to relax and have a drink.

The rooms are older and with out central A/C but the wall unit was in perfect working order, no bad smells and very efficient. The bathroom area had two vanity sinks and lots of space. The beds were comfy. There were hidden mickeys all through out the room and the french quarter theme was spot on from the curtain dividing the bedroom and bathroom area to the fleur-de-lis carved in the furniture. My only complaint of the room was the bathtub. It was really in need of refurbishment. We were in building 4 with a courtyard view. Each building area had it's own small courtyard with gardens and benches, some with fountains or ponds. We were never bored or looking for things to do at this resort. There was a large grassy courtyard area near the pool where our two year old met other children and played while the adults relaxed on the surrounding benches. The pool are was clean and baby pool was a very nice feature for families with little ones. We took a walk along the river and saw rabbits, squirrels, and lizards all along the way. The playground area was easy to access, safe, and clean. Dining was terrific! The food court had so many options and seating was ample. We never spent more than $20 a meal to feed the 3 of us (after using our refills mugs!). They provided a small table in the dining area where children could color or build legos while their parents finished eating. The lines were never very long and clean tables were always available. We took the bus several times. I was worried about this because of previous reviews but we never had a problem. Both our bus to MK and bus to Epcot were direct, no stops at Riverside. Coming back from MK we had just missed the bus and ended up with a 15 minute wait. Staff was good. Not as friendly as I have seen at other Disney properties but nothing to complain about.

This hotel is located close to Downtown Disney, Epcot, and easy to get to and from. Only had one bus stop, unlike the Riverside which had 4. Never had to wait very long for the bus or boat service.

Yes, you can hear the \"rocket\" toilets flushing on occasion, but it lasts for 2 seconds. Did not hear the people upstairs, next door, nor outside. I will say I have stayed in a Value resort, and that was my biggest complaint, was the walls were paper thin, and I could hear everything. The flowers and grounds were lovely, the river soothing. The pool was always crowded, but we were able to find lounge chairs in the middle of late afternoon no problem. The dining choices were limited as there were only 4 stations to choose meals from, where some of the other moderate hotels had quite a nice spread and lots of choices to pick from. Never had a problem finding a table to eat it, outside or in, and always managed to find something to eat. Service was excellent, except the outside pool bar probably could have used an extra set of hands as it was always busy and only one bartender. Check in was a breeze, bags were in our room in a timely manner, and room was refreshed every day including cute little towel animals.

I loved this resort and would be more than happy to stay here again. I read some of the past reviews and prepaired for certain things such as the toilets being loud. We stayed in building 4 on the 3rd floor. It was rare that we heard other toilets flush and when we did it was a faint sound and we had people on both sides of us and people below us I believe. If you weren't listening specifically for it you would not hear it. But again we were on the top floor. The room was clean and comfortable. The mousekeeping staff was great. Our daughter who is 5 truning 6 while on our trip had an accident while taking a nap. Mousekeeping had no problem at all coming in and doing a complete bedding change even though they litterally just changed it only a couple hours before hand. My husband went back to the room one afternoon and found our door ajar. It startled him a bit, when he went inside head of mousekeeping was in there inspecting mousekeepings work. One of my complaints would be that the beds are a full size beds. My husband is a tal stocky man and I am not small but not large either and we barely fit in the full size bed. There was even one night I slept with my 5 year old so that I was a bit more comfortable. Often we had towels made into ittle characters. When they made my daughters bed they always made her stuffed animals comfy. My other complaint would be the eggs in the dining hall. They were VERY under cooked. However one morning I got a ham and cheese omlet and they were just fine. A problem my husband had was that we shared a bus with Port Orleans Riverside which is a mush larger resort and had 4 stops. They drop off Riverside people first. Which we kind of had a bit of a problem with because FQ only has 1 stop, and when you have a VERY sleepy child you want to get back ASAP.

Of them all (Polynesian to the All-Stars) this is by far the best one for the money. The grounds are lovely and tranquil and the rooms are comfortable. Also, there are subtle differences in the basic rooms that make a big difference: 1) A curtain that divides the bathroom area from the sleeping area 2) Dual sinks 3) A coffee pot 4) A mini fridge (included in the room rate). Those things made a huge difference for us after having stayed at the All-Star resort for one night prior to checking into the French Quarter. Also, the All-Star resorts tend to attract a younger, rowdier crowd which makes the cafeteria and pool areas a bit unbearable at times. Another feature I loved about this resort is the ferry that runs from the resort to Downtown Disney - what a nice feeling to know that we wouldn't have to compete for a parking space on Friday night! Also, there is a great pool that the family will love. My only regret is that we didn't get to stay longer. Just a tip - if you are there more than a couple of days and you are a fountain drink fanatic as I am, get the refillable souvenir mug. It's kind of pricey at around $13, but worth it when you consider that small fountain drinks are around $3 at the resort and the parks. Also, if you are thinking of staying off-site to save money you should reconsider. With the fridge to keep a good supply of food at-hand and the fact that you don't have to pay for parking at the parks when you are a guest at a Disney resort, being at an on-site property is so much more convenient.

Large curtain to separate sinks from bedroom view - we used it to change. We were in Building 4 and our room looked out over the courtyard with a fountain. The whole area is wonderfully landscaped and each city \"square\" was different from one another. I loved walking around and feeling like I was walking in Mary Poppin's neighborhood! The kids loved seeing how it was similar to the movie The Princess and the Frog. On our 2nd day we stayed around the resort and took the boat over to Downtown Disney. The pool was a huge hit for the kids and us. There is a dragon slide - but not scary and easy for most kids to slide down - life jackets are provided to swimmers and you can use one on the slide also. Lots of life guards around. A nice hot tub was in a semi-private area away from the pool and was great after a day of walking at Epcot. We walked over to Riverside - about a 10 minute walk - very relaxing as you are following the Sassagoula River. We rented a 4 rider bike and love it. We then took a horse drawn carriage ride around. We ate at the food plaza at the Riverside - both the French Quarter and Riverside offer slightly different menus. For breakfast we would pick up beignets (think Princess and the Frog!) coffee, mickey waffles and bring it back to eat in our room. Very convenient.

The jazz music piped throughout the resort was fun and made the theme even more charming. Unfortunately, we were there during an uncharacteristic cold snap (about 29 degrees each night), so we didn't do much strolling. My only problem with the room was the heater; it didn't shut off automatically so you could really leave it running during the night. Usually this wouldn't be much of a problem, but it was very cold for us! The service was great, as you would expect at any Disney hotel. The food court was also decent, although one might run out of options after about a week of meals. The Disney buses arrive promptly and we never had any trouble finding a seat. In the mornings French Quarter has its own bus, so travel time to the parks was pretty short.

The hotel is extremely handy with young kids given how close it is to Downtown Disney and the fact you get to take water taxi to get there! The water taxi is fun 10 to 15 minute ride that our kids (along with most kids on the boat) loved. The lobby is very festive, colorful and has several great photo ops. The grounds are truly well maintained with colorful flowers, manicured shrubs, iron work and fountains in the french quarter look and feel. In addition the walking path along the \"river\" is quite nice. The rooms are adequate in that they are clean, colorful and well priced. We were in room 1131 and it was fine. The decor is a little dated and I think they have the last 19 inch thick bodied televisions left on the planet. Only true downside is that the toilet flushing sounds/feels like a rocket ship launch (i would think disney could work on that) Restaurant for breakfast is fun: Beignets are the draw for the kids all of the other items are standard. Colorful staff throwing bead necklaces and plastic coins for the little ones. Pool is very nice, it is heated and comfortable. Water slide is ok but my two loved it so what else do I care. Towels available and clean, plenty of deck space and chairs along with a nice view of the river from one of the sun decks. Bathrooms are right there and are quite clean and convenient for people using the pool Downtown disney was great. Nice restaurants (portabello's and fultons crab house were hits). Street entertainment was priceless as the girls got involved with a dance lesson, hula hoop contest along with 75 to 100 other people, great video to show them when they are both 18 and too cool for dad.

The room decor is an attempt to recreate a New Orleans \"feel,\" with its rather ornate headboards and colorful wallpaper and paint. We were satisfied with the room, but really didn't get the \"New Orleans feel.\" We did like the double pedestal sinks though--wish more hotels had double sinks. The mini-fridge was useful also.

My husband got the refillable drink mug, which can be used at the hotels but not in the parks. For a coffee or soda drinker, I guess this is a good value if you are staying at least a week. There was no milk at the beverage station and the hot chocolate was tasteless colored water.

One of best features is the free boat ride to/from Downtown Disney (runs every minutes at night and the ride is beautiful).", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Traveler0317", "ReviewID": "UR57672068", "Content": "Great hotel.

It is small, very quiet and there isn't much for kids to do so it is much better suited to a couple. It's very close to all the parks as well as to Downtown Disney. It is smaller than most of the other resorts that we visted. There were a handful, if that many, of children staying at the resort (it was also low season) so it was amazingly quiet, especially after a day in the parks. We had a room by the river which was great for the 15 minute boat ride into Downtown Disney. We had a room with a king-sized bed. The room was about 350 square feet and was, again, perfect for a couple. Unlike many other resorts, French Quarter has its own dedicated bus service to the Parks so no stopping at other resorts on the way out in the morning. On the way back, it does share the bus with Riverside, but French Quarter is always the first stop. The longest we spent on a bus was maybe fifteen minutes. Disney's bus system, by the way, is top-notch - we never waited longer than ten minutes on any bus anywhere in the World. Two cons about the hotel: one was that you could hear the toilet flushing plumbing noise a few times in the early evening (three times was the most I heard) but if you're out at the Parks or out at Downtown Disney, it wouldn't bother you. Two is the only food is a limited selection at the food court. However the Parks either close late or it's a ten minute boat ride to Downtown Disney. Alternatively, there's an actual restaurant at Riverside. We never ate at French Quarter, and we never had to. Honestly there's nothing but good things that I can say about this hotel. Service was excellent and the people who worked there were friendly and helpful. We visited the Swan, the Dolphin, Boardwalk, a bunch of other resorts while we were there, and we'd pick French Quarter again in a heartbeat. We absolutely loved it, and whole-heartedly recommend it for your trip to Walt Disney World. A few tips: (1) If you're a couple, definitely do the Disney gift card package rather than the meal plan package. We had so much more fun because we had all this money to spend on the gift card and we weren't restricted to certain menus or restaurants because we were on the meal plan. On the other hand, since Disney food is so expensive, I wouldn't recommend the gift card over the meal plan for, say, a family of 4. (2) If you have a coupon for minigolf and want to figure out how to get there using Disney transportation, no one at the hotel knows the easiest way; we eventually had to figure it out on our own. Essentially, either take the bus from either Downtown Disney or one of the Parks to Blizzard Beach for Winter Summerland, or to Disney Swan for Fantasia Mini Golf. You'll see directions for both courses once you get to your destination. (3) Eat at any or all the restaurants at Animal Kingdom lodge - it's an absolutely fantastic experience. We had lunch at Sanaa (the other restaurants aren't open for lunch) and the service and the food were both outstanding. (4) Get to Epcot and Magic Kingdom as early as possible. However for DHS and Animal Kingdom, we got there around 11 and still made it to every single attraction by 5pm. It definitely helped that it was the end of February.

We live in Florida and travel to Disney often due to the great rates for FL Residents. We deicded to make another quick trip up and booked Port Orlean's FQ for our stay. Partly because of the hotels that were available it was the \"fairest\" price and because of the positive things we had heard. I was a bit nervous due to the reviews and I will admit that in some ways, the reviews are right and the hotel does fall short in some areas, but more often than not, the experience exceeded our expectations. We are a family who spends little time in our hotel rooms, so perhaps we have a different perspective, but here was our experience in a nut shell. The resort is adorable and quaint and if you ask me - so easy to get to! We have our car and actually prefer to drive everywhere and this hotel is so accessible from every area of Disney. The theme is not overdone - it's tasteful and really quite enjoyable. My daughter was thrilled when we went to check in! There are cast members in costume handing our coins and beads to the kids and they really get a kick out of that! My daughter loved the little playground at the hotel and also the arcade! She didn't spend much time at either, but appreciated the time she did spend and it was just nice knowing it was there. Everything in the hotel is easy to get to. Unlike Coronado - you can walk to everything! We were in building 5. Nice because it's set back a little, but parking was weird. There was no great parking close to the building - a trade off to being in a nice, quiet location! The staff is friendly, warm and professional. If you do have a problem (which we did - more below) be sure to ask for the manager Mario. He is as wonderful as any manager I have ever come acorss. Genuinely concerned and apologetic for any difficulty and will go out of his way to ensure your stay is a good one. The food is Disney Hotel food - it's mass produced theme park food! It's as good as any other \"cafe\" type restaurant at other resorts. Not sure what some people truly expect. We got a quick bite there in the morning and my daughter loved the mickey waffles! the food is good - big portions for the price. good selections. If you want fine dining - go elsewhere! Even the \"five star\" type restuarants on property are mass produced food establishments - it's fine. If you are a picky eater - bring your own snacks, etc. OK, so now for the bad and ugly.... The resort itself is nice, but once you walk through the door of your hotel room you do at times feel that you have stepped out of a disney property and into a motel 6. THe rooms for the most part are clean. Not to \"ritz carlton\" standards, but we had no issues with that. Yes, as poeple have said, the rooms are outdated. hey only have double beds which is not ideal. I dont so much care that the tv wasn't flat screen. It worked and it did it's job. Aside from the beds being small, be preparred to feel the \"age\" of these beds the next morning if you are sensitive to those things. The toilet flushing was louder than any toilet i have ever heard - and of course that means not only does the sound of your own bother you, so will the sound of everyone else's! We could hear them all night. The walls are thin. Had a baby screaming next to us, but the front desk was more than happy to let us change rooms and they went out of their way to find one that had no occupied rooms to either side. should you have to do that at a moderate disney resort...no. But, i apprecaited that they were apologetic and helped fix the problem! The bathroom amentities are ok. Nothing fancy. If you are particular about products - bring your own! Our frige didn't work great. We didnt have anything spoil - but even when I told Mario the manager that it wasn't working as well as it should, he offered to reimburse me for any food/beverages that wen bad. Mario did tell us that they are due to get room overhauls before the end of the year! I will say that once that is done, i would go back and visit this resort any time! We stayed at Coronado in December. Yes, the rooms were fantastic. But the customer service was not nearly as good as Port Orleans FQ. Give this hotel a fair chance. Go knowing that while it might not be the grand floridian, it's certainly worthy of being a moderate hotel considering its amenities and amazing cast members! If you are headed to Disney and you are not likely to spend much time in the room and you can understand what you are getting at this hotel, you will enjoy and appreciate it.

A family of four can eat breakfast at this resort for about $30USD and dinner for about $40USD. It is cafeteria style so there\u2019s no tipping.

The grounds, pool area, foodcourt and other public areas were extremely well maintained. The maintenance of our room was unfortunately not up to quite the same standard. It seemed that the daily service was rushed and not overly thorough. This may have been due to lack of staff or just a particular staff member. It seemed better at the beginning, then dropped off. The room could use a little cosmetic work, and queen sized beds are a must. There is plenty of room for them and the doubles are really undersized for two adults.

I had hoped to stay someplace a little fancier, say, the Contemporary Resort, but do to budgetary reasons, I had to scale back to the POFQ. It ended up not being too big of a lost as we had a very comfortable week here (it might have been a lot colder then we were hoping for, but I can't very well fault Disney for that). Although normal check-in time was 3pm, our room was ready at 12:30pm when we arrived, which was nice. Check-in went reasonably smooth, and the people at the front desk were polite. The grounds were very beautiful and wonderfully maintained. A stroll along the paths at night can be very romantic. The buildings are still in good shape, however some signs of wear in the paint is starting to become evident. This would be an ideal time to repaint; that way the resort will never look anything but wonderful We had a room with a king bed on the second floor with a very nice view overlooking the river. The room itself was very functional and comfortable. It was kept clean. Mousekeeping did a fine job. The room has two separate sinks outside of the bathroom, allowing my wife and I to have our own space, which was really nice. That way one of us could be getting ready while the other was in the shower. The bathroom is small consisting of just the toilet and a shower. The toilet worked fine, although its flush is rather loud. The shower was great. The water heated up fast and the pressure was excellent. Some people have taken issue with the room that houses the toilet and the shower, but I have never understood that complaint. They could alter the bathroom to include the vanity area as most hotels do, but then the room would lose a lot of its functionality, especially for families. The bathroom does what it needs to do. If there is an area that the room could use some work, it is with the TV. It is an older TV and the channel selection was weak. A few movies channels would be much appreciated, and perhaps and upgrade to a flat screen TV would be in order. I did hear that Disney is in the process of adding flat screens to their moderate resorts, of which POFQ is one. I hope this is true. The bed linens and bedspread could also use some updating, however I found the mattress to be very comfortable. The temperature dial on the mini-fridge was broken so it kept freezing our water. Annoying, but no not a big deal. I didn't even mention it till I checked out. Overall, though, I was very happy with the room. I enjoyed the food court although a few healthier selections couldn't hurt. The food is rather greasy. The outdoor pool is heated and really nice, and although I didn't use the spa as my wife is pregnant, it looked fine. Maybe next time. The general store at the resort had some basic toiletries and snack foods and was a nice place to browse through. Port Orleans Riverside (another moderate resort) was a nice stroll down the path and guests at POFQ have full access to the amenities of that resort as well. We walked down there for a private carriage ride one night, which was very relaxing and romantic. We utilized the Disney Bus transportation system to get to the parks, and I had no issues with them. They run every twenty minutes, which means that sometimes the bus will be waiting when you arrive at the bus stop and other times, you will have to wait the twenty minutes. If waiting is a problem for you, then a rental car might be in order. If you are like me however, and like to be waited on while you are on vacation, a short wait is a small price to pay for not having to worry about a car. The same goes for Disney's Magical Express (their complimentary transportation to the airport). It might take a bit longer, but it is free and comfortable. It is just one less thing to worry about. They will even take car of your bags for you. POFQ also has ferryboat service to Downtown Disney. It is a relaxing and scenic alternative to taking a bus, and one we utilized. The only downside to Disney's transportation is that it can be difficult to go from one resort to another as you first have to take a bus to one of the parks and then grab another bus to the resort you are trying to get to. It can make getting to dinner reservations at another resort a bit of a hassle. Providing a shuttle service from resort to resort is something they should look into. Overall, this is a fine place to stay when you are at Disney. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Port Orleans French Quarter to someone else. It isn't the most luxurious resort at Disney, but it is clean, comfortable, convenient and the grounds are beautiful.

This recent trip we chose the Port Orleans French Quarter. We signed up for on-line check in and expected no problems. When we arrived there was only one person in line and 4 representatives at the counter. No one acknowledged us or offered to help. Finally a young woman from concierge came over and inquired if we used the \"on-line\" check in since that was the line we were in. We stated yes and she took us over to concierge. Check in was than less than 5 minutes. We were booked for 8 nights/9days. The room was nice and more importantly ready for us. Our biggest complaint was during our stay we were never given enough towels or toiletries. We have 2 adults and 3 young children and were always given 4 towels, 1 bottle of shampoo and 1 soap. Since 2 of our children are under 6 believe me they are always spilling something on themselves:) and get at least 2 baths per day. We never saw any Disney magic at this hotel. Most times at Disney the housekeeping staff will make towel animals when they know there are young children in the room. All we saw was a mass exodus of housekeeping staff daily at 3:30pm running for their shuttle. Believe me don't be in their way. This was our FIRST time ever seeing this at any of the resorts. We frequently passed staff and our children were raised to say good morning,afternoon , etc. , half the time we weren't even acknowledged. On the day before our check out the East Coast was hit by a big snowstorm. We called the front desk to inquire about extending by 1 day. The young man on the phone said they were not booked and he could extend our stay at the rate we booked our package,$149/nt. My husband went immediately down to the desk to pay for our extra night and was told then that they would only extend at $209/nt. He explained he just called and they went and got the manager who basically said too bad. As I said earlier we visit Disney 2-3 times a year and this manager was the worst of Disney customer service. I called WDW reservations and spoke with their manager. She stated she could not override the price but the manager should honor his employees guarantee. She then called the hotel for us and the manager still refused. WDW reservations then transferred our reservation to the Pop Century resort and they gave us a room at $89/nt which was below the current rate. Overall we know that each resort is operated as a single stand alone hotel and in the future will not re-book the Port Orleans French Quarter.

We visited Florida for our daughters 1st birthday- we were a little reluctant at first whether she would enjoy it or not- but to our suprise, she loved it! We went for 2 weeks at the end of November. The hotel was absoloutley amazing! In the past, we have stayed at Disney's Pop Century Resort, Disney's All Star Movies Resort, Disney's Yacht and Beach Resort and Disney's Animal Kingdom Resort, however this hotel was awarded our favourite so far with the Animal Kingdom Resort following shortly after. We stayed in a room the centre of the resort. Everything was close to our room (food court, pool, launderette and the car park) and nothing was a long walk at the French Quarter! However, a few times when we woke up before the food court opened at 6am, we would have an early morning walk down to the Riverside and we found that everything was much more spread out there and it was a much bigger resort. We preferred the FQ's food court to the Riverside as it was more fun for kids (it was very colourful and had a basket of megablocks for the children to play with). I would say, if you have children, the French Quarter is the one for you. The rooms are plenty big enough with 2 double beds, a fridge, iron, safe, plenty of drawers for clothes etc... The pool at the French Quarter was amazing and the waterslide was a lot of fun! Also, definatley take advantage of the hot tub, it is so relaxing and we wished that we had used it more than we did. We had the Quick Service Dining Plan, and my partner thought that the restaurants would be dissapointing compared to the table service meals but he was pleasantly suprised by the menu's and service we received, and as we did the table service plan the previous year, we wasn't sure what to expect but we actually preffered this plan. It saved a lot of time! On the Quick Service Plan you get 2 meals a day per person, 2 snacks (most things of a single serving under $4) a day per person and a free refillable mug per person which you can use at the hotel throughout your holiday.

So crowded!!!) We stayed at the Port Orleans - French Quarter resort on Disney. The resort is one of the moderate level resorts. We didn't want to stay in the economy, but we didn't want to dish out the dollars for the deluxe, so we chose Port Orleans. The hotel is lovely and tries to replicate the beautiful french quarter/garden district style with wraught-iron railings and courtyards. The hotel is very quiet. I don't think we ever heard our neighbors. We had a water-front view, which really was not all that spectacular. For the amount of time that you actually spend in your room, don't waste money on upgrades and views. The room does have a small fridge, which came in handy and double sinks. The resort also has a heated pool. We did not use the pool as I was afraid that once my kids got in and found that the water was warm, they would never leave. We spent too much money on the parks for the kids to prefer the pool at the hotel! The only downside to the room was that the beds our double beds, which I didn't think would be an issue. We have two kids, so we figured that we would sleep better and have more room if my husband and I each slept with a child. That might not have been the best idea. Had we gone with the deluxe resorts, we would have had bigger beds and a bunk bed option. However, that is my only con for the room. The resort offers a food court with a wide variety and has a New Orleans theme to it. It does not offer a sit down fancy dining, but with kids, that was not a priority. The resort offers around the clock transportation by bus to the parks and monorail system, which was great. It also offers boat transportation to downtown Disney. Parking was available and easy to find a spot. The only time we drove was when we left the resort to go home. For the price, I highly recommend the hotel. I enjoyed it. It was not a hotspot as it did not have a monorail that ran through it.

The service is slow at times, but the service is always friendly. There's a pool, which most kids will enjoy, and a waterslide, which is a bit mild for my tastes. I'm a big fan of wild water rides! The hot tub is separate from the pool area. Compared to the one at the Caribbean Resort, this one is quite large. There are a lot of friendly people in the hot tub each evening. The French Quarter does not have a sit down restaurant, but you can either take a short walk or boat ride to Riverside next door. This resort is very charming as well and it;s like you're staying in two resorts for the price of one! The buses run regularly and you can talk a boat to Downtown Disney.

Our receptionist at check in was very nice and gave us a map to the nearest car park and our room, which was conveniently located near to the bus stop, car park and lobby area (building 4, sneaky shortcut to bus stop). We were also able to purchase park tickets in reception to add to our room keys (one less thing to lose), which was also easy and that cast member was also helpful and didn't try to sell us anything extra, just gave us what we asked for. The room was clean, tidy and not painfully Disneyfied. The bathroom was probably the most dated aspect but was clean with good shower pressure and a huge supply of towels. The airconditioning unit was very effective and quiet, compared to the last I-drive hotel I was in. We had towel animals every day and housekeeping were more than diligent in keeping the room clean during our stay. I would only fault them for their keenness to get in and clean the room on the day we left but they waited, I just felt slightly rushed and surprised as that hadn't happened on any of our other days. The park buses were frequent when leaving the hotel, the waiting area has benches and fans, important in the muggy summer months, not really an issue in November! It can be a wait for the buses at park closing times and I noticed that this was when the buses were shared with Riverside. We probably waited about 10mins or so for a bus either way so you're not spending valuable park time at a bus stop! The food court is convenient and has a good selection of family safe options and was open quite late. Can only vouch for the burgers but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The obligatory gift store also had a few sundries in case you needed water, snacks or the odd band aid. Overall, I really liked the complete ease of the entire stay, having the room key to charge meals anywhere in the park to, send our souvenirs back to the resort and our park tickets on, plus the novelty of extra magic hours to try rides in the dark! Also, not having to track the hotel bus down, they were really easy to find compared to the Mears buses for outside hotels. If I had kids, this would be the only way to do Disney but I'd probably cough up the extra for the Monorail resorts, after robbing the bank, which we didn't have to do for POFQ. The boat to Downtown Disney was just as efficient as the buses, with a little sightseeing tour included. I'll just say if Dixieland jazz doesn't appeal to you, I'd suggest another resort, it's piped in around the grounds, on the buses and boats. The pool looks really cool but never had time for it!

The pool at French Quarter is a nice large affair, and it has a wonderful slide and lots of fun bells-and-whistles, such as a fountain that splashes into the pool from four \"alligators\" standing beside it. Fun! Although I don't know if this would've been handled differently at any other Disney property, I think it is worth mentioning that the Port Orleans staff were beyond helpful to me during my trip in one key instance. It was about midnight, and my 2-year old was coming down with a fever. I ran to the gift shop which I hoped might stay open until midnight, but I learned it actually closes at 11. When I approached the front desk, they immediately opened the shop for me without hesitation, and got children's Tylenol for me. Again, probably any Disney property would've done it, but they put me so at ease when I was a bit nervous, so the Port Orleans staff deserve credit for that. The travel time to the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT and Hollywood Studios by the bus service was about 10 minutes - very convenient. Animal Kingdom was quite a ride. This is one of the main pluses of this resort - it's really quite close to nearly everything with just the one exception of Animal Kingdom. Also, there are taxis that wait in the front holding lot of this resort which can be called by the Bellman. We had to get to a lunch at EPCOT quickly on the day of our arrival, and the cab was efficient, clean and about $10. All in all, a lovely place, especially for anyone looking for a quieter resort at Disney.", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontefract, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic \"Small\" Resort\u201d", "Author": "wanito", "ReviewID": "UR48486564", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 weeks and had a great time.

I had read some reports on here about cleanliness so was a bit aprehensive but we had excellent housekeeping throughout our stay with lots of nice towels arrangements for the girls to find on our return to the room each day. The resort is perfect for smaller children as after a hard day walking around the parks the last thing you want is a trek around the resort. Everything is so close together a few minutes walk will get you anywhere. The staff we encountered were really helpful and sorted out any queries we had. When we needed to seek minor medical attention for our daughter they even called us cab and told us they would charge it to the hotel. Transportation was excellent with very little waiting around before a bus arrived. On the rare occassion we shared with Riverside we were picked up first so got seats and then returning we were dropped off first so a win win situation. Elliott Dyson in the Scats Lounge was great and made such a fuss of the girls that one night they turned down the eveing parade to go back a see Elliott perform! We visited lots of the other resorts and although they were all great we did notice they all had more than 1 bus \"depot\" due to their size so having several stops within the resort before even leaving for the parks would get a bit wearing when staying for 2 weeks. Also the thought of needing to catch a bus just to get to the pool or dining would not appeal either.

Staff, particularly in food halls, ( by the way that's what they are, so don't be confused with the claim of multi dining opportunities, it is the same principle as your average shopping center food court) were someway short of the 'Disney' standards of friendliness. Would recommend taking the ten minute stroll down to Riverside if eating in the hotel, as, particularly at peak eating times like breakfast, the FQ capacity is woefully short. Without the benefit of having Downtown a 15 min boat ride away, evening dining would have been limited and would have involved additional cab fares to get away for somrthing bette than fast food, which itself waas not particularly tasty, and didn't vary in 14 days. Breakfast, a big feature of previous US hols was particularly disappointing, and we ended up eating plain cereal as the best deal. So in summary, if you want to have convenient accommodation for the Disney parks, and are not looking for anything special in your hotel facilities it is fine especially if you have younger kids, but don't expect any level of sophistication.

We used the Disney Dining Plan which was super easy. Because the resort is smaller you don't have the benefits of a sit-down restaurant or a large variety menu in the dining hall, but that was OK for us. Walked down to Riverside one morning for a change of pace and were overwhelmed with the crowds and lines. The intimacy of POFQ spoiled us for sure! If you stay here, take advantage of the water taxi to Downtown Disney. Most of the restaurants there also accept the dining plan and the trip over is a vaction in itself! Our only complaint of the hotel was the dingy paint job on the guest room doors of the buildings. I knew this was a motel style hotel, but I didn't expect it to LOOK like a motel. However, during our last two days there, we noticed the maintenance staff systematically sanding and painting all the doors. We didn't even have time to complain before the issue was resolved. As for mousekeeping, I can't complain about much. We prefer to be a bit more eco friendly when traveling and requested our towels and sheets only be changed once while we were there. However, they left us a bag of fresh towels and such even if we left out the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. We had to actually call and tell them NOT to bring us fresh things and they complied.

POFQ is small friendly and accessible from each of the buildings. We will be back without a doubt Magical Express This is a great free transfer provided by Disney; if you travel from within the USA they collect your luggage and deliver them to you room at the Disney resort. if you travel from UK you need to collect your own bags and take them to the Disney magical express desk. Transfer takes around 30-40 minuets. Check in This was easy we used the on line check in and our room and information was ready when we arrived. Check in was very easy and the desk staff helpful. The room The rooms are well presented the same size as most Disney rooms (they tend to stick to the same format) moderate resorts have two sinks (value resorts have 1) which is very useful when getting ready in the morning. The room has two double beds sleeping 4 people, this may be a little cramped if you travel with teenagers (but again this is the same with nearly all Disney resorts- all star resorts have some suites). Some reviews on her show photos of dust and dirty rooms; our room was always clean and made up every day, fresh towels and toiletry\u2019s every day. I believe that if you look at almost any hotel review you will find some unclean rooms as not all staff have the same standards. Food court The food court was ok some of the staff don\u2019t speak very good English but you manage. Good choice of food snacks throughout the day. If you are on the Disney dinning plan there is plenty of options (dinning plan is a great deal in my opinion, we have bought it on our previous trips to Disney and always found it to be good value, this time we got it free as part of the Disney package). The refill cup for around $13 is a must you can get this refilled as often as you want with soda (pop) coffee, hot chocolate or water, (I have been told you need to use this three times to benefit) You can use the nearby food court at riverside 10 min walk or you can take the water taxi or bus. The riverside food court is much better with the option to create your own salad or pasta, fresh sandwiches. The evening meals are nice over there and they have a restaurant. Shop The store at POFQ is small with some essentials on offer and a small choice of Disney gifts on offer, again the riverside store has more choice (this is a supply and demand issue, as POFQ is a small resort and riverside is very large) You can buy soda (Pop), juice, wine, beer, bread, donuts, pastries, milk to name just a few, a bottle of Bud is around $6. The pool The kids will love the pool with a slide, children\u2019s float/ life vests available to use for free, free towels to use around the pool, plenty of sun loungers and chairs around. It was September when we visited this is a very quiet time at Disney. Getting a sun bed was not a problem any time of day. The hot tub is very nice to use after a long day in the parks it holds around 10 people at a time. It\u2019s supposed to close at midnight but people continue to use it after that. Oddly children can use this hot tub if supervised by adult. The temperature is around 104 degrees ( *advise children can not control thee body temperature and could have problems in the hot tub- drink plenty of water and don\u2019t let them in for very long if you let them in at all) Transport The bus to any Disney park arrived around every 10-15 min great for getting to the parks; some times you have to stand up. The trip to and from the parks can be educational talking to other guests. The trip to and from the parks take around 10 to 20 minuets depending on what park you are going to. Please note there is no transport to and from resort to resort. So if you are dinning at a hotel/resort you need to travel to a park then to the resort. The return journey from the park can be very busy especially after the fireworks at MK. The boat/ water taxi to down town Disney and to the riverside is very nice and makes a relaxing shopping trip/ visit to downtown. Transport to other non Disney parks - taxi cabs are available all day outside reception cost around $30 to seaworld $35 to universal (if you go in you car it is $13 to park for the day) buses are available from the ticket and transportation centre but it takes a long time. Tips / gratuities Usually $1 a bag/ case to bus driver, for taxi $3 for a $30 trip (this is what I was told from a USA resident) you pay 15% to 20% at restraints. Photopass This is good especially if you travel with family so you all get on the photo, you can buy a CD with all your photos on for around $150 ( a lot of money may be but you can have hundreds of photos with Disney boarders and characters signatures\u2019 on them) Hope this is of some use to you, feel free to ask questions.", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWe preferred Coronado Springs.\u201d", "Author": "VickieMH", "ReviewID": "UR46497771", "Content": "Port Orleans is a Moderate Disney Hotel.

Cleaners came in everyday but they did not clean as well as they could have, Dust on TV, down the headboards and dirt on sink pedestal on day of arrival until we left. Bathroom was small and needs an upgrade but it was clean enough and the free shampoo and soap were a nice touch. The restaurant was ok for a snack but the meals were bland. I had a Vegetarian burger for $ 6.99 and thats what I got no lettuce, relish or cheese. Room service consisted of Pizza Delivery. The French Quarter is next to Riverside and very often one bus would need to collect from both locations and would be full. I would recommend staying at the Coronado, it has one bus service, better restaurants and a business centre if you require internet access. PS recommendations for food, if you are on the Disney Dining Plan check out Ohanas at the Polynesian Hotel, The Yachtmen Steakhouse at the Yacht Club, The Brown Derby at Hollywood Studios, Crystal Palace in Magic Kingdom and Sunshine Seasons is an excellent Counter Service restaurant. I am Veggie and my Husband is Meat eater and we were all pleased with the choices in these restaurants. I would recommend you steer well away from restaurants not owned by Disney but doing the plan i.e Planet Hollywood and Raglan Road Irish pub, we were made to feel like second class citizens here for using the plan, they freely admit they take off with your card prior to the meal to check on it to ensure you can cover the bill. They also like to mention regularly that they require a good tip, they seemed to change their tune when presented with the generous Gratutity afterwards. Not sure if they think the british are tight on tips?

Several years ago, I had stayed in one of the Disney Value Resorts, and wasn't impressed, not with the quality, the location (FAR from everything, which meant it took forever to get anywhere), crowd, service, etc. On this visit, I wanted to try staying on Disney property again, but was looking to avoid those problems. The Port Orleans was a perfect choice! First, location. The Port Orleans is very close to Downtown Disney, which serves two benefits: a) close to restaurants and shops and activities; and b) close to a transportation \"hub.\" This is important. If you are relying on Disney transportation, you cannot get between the hotels directly, usually (the exception being the monorail hotels). Thus, if you are staying at one hotel and want to get to another (to use spa services, or visit a restaurant, or other activities at the resorts) you have to go to a hub (Downtown Disney or one of the theme parks) and switch to another bus. Being close to Downtown Disney made this a breeze from the Port Orleans. Also, Port Orleans is close to EPCOT and not too far from the Magic Kingdom. Really the only park that's far is Animal Kingdom, and since we weren't planning to visit there on this trip it wasn't an issue. Second, price. We got a great deal on this hotel (~40% off the rack rates, but responding to a promotional email), which made it an even better deal than normal, but I still think it's well worth the price point. Port Orleans is a step about the Value Resorts, and a step below the Deluxe Resorts (such as the Yacht Club or the Wilderness Lodge, for example), which makes it the best value for the price. The Value Resorts, while cheap, *feel* cheap. The beds aren't comfortable, the service is nonexistent, and everything looks and feels flimsy. The Deluxe Resorts, while very nice, are often prohibitively expensive for the average person, and I question whether the vastly increased price matches an increase in quality. The Port Orleans, on the other hand, has a price that fits well with its level of comfort. Third, room/setting: The Port Orleans is adorable. The pathways are pretty and well-groomed and styled to look like the French Quarter in New Orleans (obviously). The buildings are not particularly special, but an attempt is made to make them look like more than just a motel building. The room is fine -- comfortable beds, clean, furniture that is made out of actual wood and not particle board. Everything is well kept. Fourth, service: I was very pleased with the service. We didn't have anything particularly special, but everyone was nice and took the time to answer questions are greet us. With the Value Resorts, I ended up feeling like I was a hassle to all the employees -- just another in the herd of cattle moving through the hotel -- but at the Port Orleans it felt more personal. The concierge was able to book us dinner reservations on our second day with no trouble, and the gift shop ladies were a lot of help when I was looking for something specific.

We arrived many hours prior to the official check in time and were told that as soon as our rooms were cleaned we could get into them. Within a hour of arriving all three rooms were ready to be occupied. The rooms were clean and each day when we returned from the parks the rooms were made up and towels and toiletries were replenished. The resort offered a cafeteria type area where quick service meals were available until midnight. Choices included, but were not limited to, taco salads, grilled chicken sandwiches, burgers, pizza, spaghetti and meatballs. Next to the eating area there was also a bar and very small lounge area. Next to the pool was also an outdoor bar area. The pool was very large. They had a separate wading pool for the little ones and a separate hot tub area. The resort also offers horse drawn carriage rides (for a fee) and numerous quiet garden and fountain areas. While at the resort we utilized Disney's free buses for transportation around the various parks. Buses came at regular intervals and were always clean and air conditioned. Most parks were a 10-15 minute bus ride away. Sometimes the buses would go straight to the parks and sometimes they would stop at the 4 bus stops at Port Orleans Riverside. When this happened the buses were extremely packed and the trips to the parks took some time. The return trips to the hotel seemed to be just as packed as most buses accomodated both resorts; however, the French Quarter is the first stop on the way back so it's not too bad. We also utilized the boat transportation to Downtown Disney from our resort. It is about a 12-15 minute ride down the \"Sassagoula River\" from the resort to Downtown and is a lovely, relaxing way to get to your destination. The only negative experience we had was with checking into our flight the last day and utilizing Disney's Magical Express. The counter in the lobby only accomodates two staff members at a time to check in people for their flights. We waited on line for 40 minutes only to be told that I'd have to wait in line again at the airport to check in since the Magical Express Bus was leaving. The young man that was attending to our party was very rude and actually laughed at me when he told me I'd have to check in at the airport. Hmmm, not so \"magical\" to me. In all fairness, that was the only rude Disney employee we encountered the entire time we were at Disney. Port Orleans French Quarter is one of the smaller resorts on Disney property and as such is quiet and not as crowded as other resorts.

Our room had 2 double pedestal sinks with a tall curtain separating the sink area from the room - it was very nice an convenient. My friend's was all enclosed with a door, I didn't like that as much as I did ours. I read a lot of reviews about the maid service making towel animals and leaving them on the bed - neither of our parties found any towel animals on our beds, but maybe it was because we didn't leave a daily tip for the maid - we left her a Christmas card with cash in it on our last day. The layout was a little confusing at first, but then again we arrived at nighttime. It seemed like we had to haul our luggage a long ways to get to our room, what I did not realize is there are \"turn ins\" where you can pull out of the traffic lanes, park, and unload your luggage, and they are located much closer to the rooms. The food court was really good and had a good variety, something for everyone. I was especially thrilled to see they offered Coke Zero in the fountain machines. Ribs, mashed potatoes, chicken, freshly cooked burgers, pizza, beignets, ice cream, and other treats galore. The food court is open late for those arriving back from the parks late. Plenty of room to sit, never had a problem finding a seat. The hotel is smaller footprint-wise, meaning not as many rooms which helped simplify things. One central bus station was a bit of a downer since the bus did fill up at times and we had to wait for another or stand. The help at the front desk was great. I had left my return driving directions at home, and they had pre-made driving directions on an index card they gave me so I was able to get home without a problem.

I called a week before to request the room and was told that it was an upgrade but they would request we be close building 5. When we checked in, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were in building 5, a free upgrade. It was a great location, considering we swam in the pool every day and would drag our double stroller and young kids back from the bus when the parks closed. The staff was beyond friendly. They were accommodating, sweet and very helpful. The rooms are a little worn, but for a place to sleep, it gets the job done. Bathrooms are tiny. We had groceries delivered from Garden Grocer the day we arrived. What a great deal. The rooms have a mini fridge and was great for the kids milk, water, gatorade, etc. If you want to save a mint on drinks in the park, this was a great alternative.

This resort is showing its age but does possess a certain charm. The room size is adequate with two double (not queen) beds. The beds were very comfortable. There are double sinks and a great marble shelf above both sinks on which to place all your toiletry items. The closest is exposed to the sink area with lots of hangers and another shelf. The tub and toilet were in a separate, very small room. The room is supplied with a small coffee maker and housekeeping did leave lots of coffee packs each day. There is also a small refrigerator that worked well. The air conditioning worked very well and kept us cool during a very humid September. My biggest complaint about the room was the towels and linens. I was very disappointed to see threadbare towels with holes in them at the Disney Moderate resort. The bed sheets were fine but the bedspread is in dire need of replacement. We found all of the staff at the resort very nice with the exception of the concierges. It has always been my experience that concierges were there to help their guests with any of their needs or to give information. Thanks to Trip Advisors previous posts I was able to get the information and directions as to how to use the public transportation to go The Florida Mall for one morning. I thought I would just check with the resort\u2019s concierges to see what their suggestions would be in case they knew of a method that was easier. I was aghast that she knew of no way of getting to The Florida Mall by public transportation. She advised me that it would be a huge hassle with many, many transfers. Basically inferring that it couldn\u2019t be done. She did manage to recall (but was unsure) that Mears Transportation did a trip once a week for $18.00 and gave me a phone number to call. I used the Trip Advisor information and boated to Downtown Disney and easily walked across the street to catch the Lynx bus for $2.00 each way direct to the mall and back. The boat to Downtown Disney and the bus system was wonderful to have. Be aware if you close down any of the parks that it is mayhem getting onto the bus to go back to POR. It\u2019s like trying to put on a pair of size 4 jeans when you are really a size 12. The congestion is unreal as people line up for the various bus stops blocking others from moving past them to their own bus stop.

All in all, this was an awesome Disney resort. Firstly, once we arrived we were checked in promptly and given our \"Keys to the World\". We went to checkout our room (Building 2, Room 2222) and found the room to be just like the pictures with a nice towel animal greeting us. It appeared as though the room had just been painted and everything seemed to be nice and clean. An added bonus was a nice overview of a courtyard with a very pretty fountain. Building 2 is an awesome building to stay in because you are directly across from the pool and laundry and also extremely close to the main building where the food court, gift shop and etc. are. Although the rooms aren't humungous, they were fine for our family of four. So here's a breakdown of POFQ. Positives: Small resort, with minimal walking and only one bus stop. Awesome location. Friendly and accomodating staff. Quiet and not in your face Disney. Very cute fairly large pool! It was me and all of the four year olds going down the dragon water slide, I'm fifteen :) Landscaping. I could tell that the resort was always trying to keep up on maitnence and every morning as we left the hotel we would see many cast members watering plants, painting, etc. Price. Escpecially with the free dining plan. Negatives: Housekeeping not giving us enough towels and shampoo for four, as well as not doing simple things like dumping out the water from the ice bucket. The boat to Downtown Disney, since you have to share it with POR, it is a horror getting on on a Friday night. The bus system generally, even though we drove most of the time. Double beds. No flat screen TVs. Lastly, if you are considering staying either here or POR. Chose POFQ 100% especially if you are going to take the bus. Everyone we encountered from POR had a tired, frazzled and mean look to them. I try to say this kindly, but they were a tad grumpy. Also, POR has four bus stops instead of just the one POFQ has.

It was the childrens first time at Disney and they soon got into the \"Disney\" spirit. Even the 15 year old got sprinkled with the Disney magic dust and had his photo taken with Mickey Mouse etc! We found it to be a nice size - not too big - some of the other resorts had 4 or more bus stops to service the Disney transport, French Quarter only had one. There is also the added advantage that the water taxi to and from Downtown Disney can be used. This was actually quite a nice little river trip and depending on the \"Captain\" could be informative as well. The food court was canteen style (got the free quick service dining plan so not complaining) but if you look around, and ask questions on here, quite reasonable alternatives can be found. Put it this way, I didn't have any burgers during our stay. I loved the food at Morocco in the World Showcase at Epcot, and the Seasons food court at the Land Pavillion was pretty good too. Okay, none them were fine dining experiences, but my 2 wanted to be in and out and back to the action. We found the rooms to be of adequate size, although after 17 nights of 4 of us in the room I think we all had enough of being on top of each other.

We personally liked the fact it was smaller than the average Disney hotel, other people we spoke to thought the same. The Disney theme (small rodent with big ears) is not as prominent in the hotels, which is a bit of a relief, you can tend to get \"Disney'd out\" after 17 days! We booked the flight and hotel seperately, flight with US Airways, maybe not the most luxurious of airlines but it got us there and back at a very reasonable cost for the school holidays, and the hotel through Walt Disney UK.

The resort grounds are beautiful, peaceful and relaxing. The last time we were here was 13 years ago for our honeymoon and had a wonderful time then too. This time we were able to do online check-in before leaving home which was very easy and quick. We took advantage of the Magic Express transportation from the airport and we were very surprised that we were the only family besides one other on the bus so our wait was very minimal and arriving at the resort fairly quickly. Upon our arrival after a red eye flight, the check in process was very quick; however, our room was not ready yet being that it was only 7 am. The desk clerk was trying to get us a room that was open but apparently was an upgrade as far as the view goes but the manager was very stern and flatly said, \"No!\" The desk clerk gave us the hotel number to call later in the morning or early afternoon to check. We ended up going to the parks to kill some time. Our room was ready just after lunch. When we got to our rooms, our luggage was there already and when we called bell services for our carry-on, they delivered them within 15 minutes time which was very impressive to us. Our room was just right for the four of us, kids are 10 and 7 so the doubles were not to crammed for us. It was on the smallest side but we were mainly out and about so not an issue for us. We had enough room for our luggage and things. The room we ended getting was only steps from a river view but we had a wonderful view of the courtyard. We were in building 6 on the 3rd floor. It was clean so we felt very fortunate given the reviews in whihc other families encountered dirty bathrooms and leftover food. Our mousekeeper was very good. We requested room cleaning every other day and on the days we didn't have cleaning, she left a bag of fresh towels and toiletries on the door for us. On cleaning days, she left towel animals to greet us after a long day out. Very nice touch! We felt the walk to the bus transportation was not too far at all even after a long day. We only had to wait a couple of times beyond 15 minutes during our whole trip. Otherwise, we felt the wait was very efficient. Only once did the bus go to PORiverside which has 4 stops so that was a good thing too. We thought the river taxi to downtown Disney was the best. It was a leisurely ride down the river that took about 20 to 30 minutes. We did this many times during our stay to eat at Downtown Disney. The kids loved the pool which was clean and had plenty of towels available. The work staff was very friendly and courteous without being too overbearing. The cafeteria actually had pretty good offerings - mexican, italian and american. Better than we expected. Decent prices for the amount of food we got. We really enjoyed the beignets! Yummy! Check out was easy as well. We were able to check in our luggage for the airport at the lobby. They were very friendly and helpful. We did have to wait over 15 minutes our scheduled pick up time for the Magic Express bus which made us a bit nervous. The bus appeared to be near capacity but we were able to find seats for us and got to the airport with time to spare.

The double beds are high and we found them too firm and uncomfortable. There was a separate curtained vanity area with two pedestal sinks at a nice height for kids and a shelf with bar for hanging clothes outfitted with iron and board. The toilet/tub room was small and nothing special. Our little girls found the Mickey-shaped configuration of towels on the bed fun. Our kids loved the pool area, which includes a sea-serpent waterslide. Our only complaint was that the lifeguards didn't arrive until 10 am on a hot August Saturday morning, so the slide wasn't opened until then. The nice thing about staying here is that you can take the ferry boat to Downtown Disney and to the larger companion property Port Orleans Riverside. And you're free to use the pool area at Riverside's Ol' Man Island, too; it has a bigger waterslide than FQ's. Both hotels have a playground on the property. There's a lot more to do at Riverside, but it's also much bigger and more spread out and more crowded than FQ, so we were glad we picked the smaller one.

The room was fine and I do like the two sinks outside the tub/toilet area. We had plenty of room for two, but I would nto want 4 people in that size of a room. Really enjoyed the hottub and our greeter Beau who was there every day with maps of the parks and tips for us. I can understand people not enjoying the food court as it was loud first thing in the morning - but the food was good and filling. Do yourself a favour and get the dining plan. We booked 3 months out and were able to get great restaurants. We did figure out the cost of purchasing the meals versus the plan and we came out way ahead. The truth is that we would have spent as much and ended up eating junk for 7 days without the plan. With the plan we have wonderful dinners each night. If you want a quiet place to relax after the parks - this is it.

It's a little spread out but it's not as bad as some other Disney hotels are. So you might have a short walk to the pool or parking lot but nothing too bad. The rooms are nothing special - your basic hotel room setup. It was a place to sleep after being at the park all day. If we had stayed longer we would have explored the grounds more and maybe had a meal or two, but we mostly just collapsed there each night. I paid extra for a river view, which was nice, but with all the walks back and forth from the car I would rather have had something closer to the parking lot (which is on the opposite side from the river).

I have seen others write that it is a nice, quiet respite after a hectic day at the parks, and they are absolutely right! It was truly refreshing to come \"home\" to POFQ and be able to unwind in general peace and quiet. We chose POFQ because it is considerably smaller than the other moderates, and that is the key to it's charm. My only complaint was with the mousekeeping. I was so looking forward to the towel animals for my daughters to enjoy, but there were none for us in the 10 days we spent there. As disappointing as that was, we were doubly discouraged by the quality of their overall service. Used glasses left on the table and not replaced without a phone call, sinks not cleaned/rinsed out, and vacuuming done at the absolute minimum, if at all. Thankfully, we are not a messy lot, and my wife typically straightens up prior to the maids arrival anyway, so it was not as big an issue as it could have been. But still, a little disheartening considering it is Disney and you expect top notch service. Thankfully, the rest of the staff at the hotel provided typical Disney service. I have seen some reviews mention the level of noise you are able to hear while in your room, and I can honestly say that was not the case for us. We even had 2 or 3 rather large teenage tour groups there at the same time, and noise was never an issue. The pool is great and a lot of fun for everyone.

Debris on sidewalks was cleaned up after a couple days with a gas powered blower at 8:00 am, nice job but awful loud. Elevator in bldg 3 has broken buttons, paint stains of flooring, chips on walls where bell carts have run into them. I could go on and on and get picky but I won't, just overall not what I expected from Disney. Luggage finally made it to our room after 5 hours. Travel agent (AAA) did not give us the proper tags for our bags or travel vouchers so I guess this is not entirely a Disney problem but the attitude of the bell services staff was as if I was bothering them by asking questions The biggest disappointment of all was the conceirge service. The dinner reservation that was made by the hotel at TRex had to be changed due to a schedule conflict. While near the restaurant at DD the day before I decided to change it myself. The reservation made a day earlier by the con. did not exist. So I made a phone call and took care of it myself. I would recommend following up reservations or make them yourself. The one experience I did have with the con. that I have never had anyplace else was when they told me NO, they did not have a pair of scissors I could borrow for a couple of days. I absolutely found this to be amazing, I was told to go to gift shop to see if they had one (I had already checked there and many other stores). While my experiences with concierge service is not numerous, the ones I have had were always pleasant and my request was always met. (Hard Rock/Universal in 2007 comes to mind) The best value was the dining plan and the best service provided was by the Housekeeping staff. As I said, my stay at CBR in 2006 was much better and the service was far superior. Maybe its the economy or maybe complacency but once inside this property at WDW, I failed to see any difference between it and the place that leaves a light on for you", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "dayton", "Title": "\u201cGet Two Hotels in One!\u201d", "Author": "alluna", "ReviewID": "UR32601298", "Content": "Our first trip ever to Disney World was one that I budgeted carefully. We are not a rich family, but we could afford to save some scratch all year to take the kids to Disney World. This is usually the story of the families who stay at hotels like Port Orleans French Quarter, which is priced in Disney's 'Moderate' range. One of the best features of Port Orleans is that you are really getting the services of two hotels for one low price. The Port Orleans Riverside is just down the river and has a whole other pool and amenities to explore. You can take a brief walk or bike ride to Riverside, or take the boat ferry, which offers beautiful views of the New Orleans themed river and vegetation. When booking, we chose French Quarter because it seemed like the more 'fun' out of the two. With Mardi Gras clowns, musical crocodiles and crowned heads decorating the outside and eatery, we decided our kids would get the most out of this atmosphere. The pool at French Quarter also features a long serpentine dragon slide with Triton riding upon his head. Again, we were going for the fantasy on our vacation, so this was a feature we loved. The pool has plenty of seating and the hot tub is set off on a secluded path covered in foliage and away from the splashes of the pool, (but not too far from the bar!). Take the ferry and you get a whole new pool at Riverside. It has less theme to it, but offers a great slide that weaves through the plants and a hot tub that is closer to the pool if you'd rather keep one eye on the kids while you relax. The double hotel factor makes Port Orleans more of a luxurious resort than Disney gives it credit for. Which is great for us, because that means a lower room price. Avoid the over-abundance of loud families at the Value hotels while avoiding the skyrocketing prices of the Deluxe resorts. Port Orleans was anything but moderate in service, cleanliness and activities. The quality was outstanding in all of these areas. The desk managers had french accents and spoke French to some of the overseas guests, so the New Orleans theme was flawless. Our Mousekeeper (housekeeper) always left towel animals for us and rearranged our stuffed animal souvenirs all over the room. The room was spotless and our bags, grocery service and pizza delivery were always delivered on time. I think that some of the negative reviews for cleanliness for French Quarter are from some VERY picky clean freaks. The only 'moderate' aspect may be the room size. Who spends their vacation in the room, anyway? To avoid a smallish room, simply ask for a corner room at the front desk. Also, ask for buildings 3, 4, 5 or 2 if you are adverse to walking far to get to the front desk, pool and eatery.

Needless to say it is standard for them to change the bedding your 4th night there and it did eventually get changed (didn't fret too much cause I brought a pillow to use from home).

It is a nice and unique looking hotel though. All rooms are accessed from outside, which I always thought was the difference between a hotel and motel....oh well. The grounds were very nice and well kept. Everything was very clean. There is a walking path that leads to the Riverside hotel The Room: We had a king size bed. The matress was a little hard, but I've had worse. The pillows however were the worst I've ever had in a hotel/motel....they were hard as rocks and extremely high. After the first sleepless night, I ended up cutting open the pillow and took out half the stuffing....after that, things were much nicer. The shower was pretty standard, with a slightly above average sized tub. The powder room is separated via a curtain and had 2 separate sinks and mirrors which was nice. The room had enought drawer space, an average tv, and a mini fridge. One odd issue with the rooms in this hotel is the toilet. They flush with the power of a jet engine. That was fine, until it was time for sleep and you realized that you can hear a loud WHOOOOSH every time the room next door would flush. If you're lucky, your neighbors won't be peeing and flushing all night....we weren't so lucky a few nights. Front Desk: Nice as could be and very helpful with anything we needed. We had groceries delivered (good money saver in disney) to the hotel prior to arriving and they held them for us. They helped with any reservations we needed and made checking out and baggage for the flight pain free. Pool: The pool at the Port Orleans French Quarter is geared more towards children then it is adults. The slide is too slow for an adult to have a good time (Grand Floridian has a great one though). Also, we went in May, where the nights are still chilly, so it would have been nice if the pool had been heated. There is also a separate hot tub/jacuzzi area. You are allowed to use Port Orleans Riverside's pools though, and they were much nicer for adults (and warmer for some reason). Food: Just a basic food court here. Pizza, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, hamburgers, sandwiches, etc. Nothing fancy, but it was good enough for a quick snack or meal. They also serve breakfast, but we never got any. Transportation: You can take the boat to Downtown Disney (only do this if you feel like taking your time) or you can use their shuttle bus service. Depending on where you are going, the trip can be a pain, or nice and quick. Magic Kingdom is about a 10 minute ride (although, you might be waiting at the bus terminal for up to 20 minutes for any bus). Epcot and MGM are also fairly quick rides at 10-15 minutes. Animail Kingdom is a little longer (and it also stops at Blizzard Beach) at maybe 15-20 minutes. And Downtown Disney seemed to be the longest (it took about a half hour to get home one night). One advantage that Port Orleans French Quarter has over Port Orleans Riverside is that the buses are FAR LESS packed. The lines for Riverside were always 2-4 times longer than the French Quarter Bus lines (although, sometimes, you are forced to share a bus with the sister hotel....but usually not). Overall, it's a nice place to stay in Disney. Quick transportation to all the them parks and a moderate price each night.

I choose the French Quarters because it's a lot smaller than the other hotels and I didn't want to have to walk half way around the world to get to the food court and the bus stop. I was pleased with my choice. French Quarters was a clean, quiet, and comfortable resort. We stayed in the further end of building 4, which is only about a block away from everything. My 10 year old loved the pool. We arrived at 12pm and our room was ready and check-in only took 5 minutes. The only draw back about the rooms were the smallness of the bathroom and you can hear the toilets flush in other rooms. But after a long day at the park we were just ready to go to sleep and sometimes passed out in our clothes. Our flight didn't leave until 7pm that night and check-out is at 11am. I called the front desk that morning to ask for more time but was told all the late check-outs were already taken. That was kind of a bummer but I'll know next time. Also the water taxi to Downtown Disney is a nice ride. It's a lot nicer than taking the bus everywhere and it seems to run just as often. Other than that it was a good experience and I would stay her again. ***TIP***If your catching the magical express to the airport make sure to check your bags in early because the line becomes extremely long around check-out time and also if you have an early flight you may have to take your bags with you to the airport because the resort doesn't have enough time to get them there in time. One more tip. Purchase the mug in the food court for $12.95 and get unlimited refills. I only purchased 1 for me and my daughter and that was plenty. The food court was so close to our room that if we needed more we could just go get a refill.

We are always pleased with the intimate size of this moderate Disney resort, as compared with the others that have so many more rooms.

Pros: Bus service - never had to wait longer than 5 miinutes at the resort or from parks. My parents were able to get to and from many different activities that did not include the actual parks, and the staff were always available and willing to direct them on how to get to where they were heading. Food court - We were on the Disney Dining Plan, and the quick-service meals here were fantastic - rotisserie chicken, bbq ribs, etc. Come to find out, whenever there is a new employee for any resort kitchen, they train at POFQ for up to six months before being assigned to another resort. They pride themselves on having the best food in all WDW because of this training program. Laundry facilities - very convenient - as we found out with the 2-year-old. We were able to put the laundry in and enjoy the pool while the clothes were washed and dried. Cons: Room cleaning - the rooms were not kept up to the standards we have come to expect from WDW resorts. Upon check-in, one room had dust so thick on the shelf above the \"closet\" that my mom wrote her name in it. Another room had so much toothpaste and hairspray on the mirrors that you couldn't even chip it off with your fingernail and there was hair on the floor behind the bathroom door - yuck! My husband ended up having to work a couple of mornings from the room on his computer, so he was able to direct the maid staff (and tipping went a long way), and the issues were resolved. Boat - the boat to Downtown Disney that left from POFQ was out of commission the entire 10 days we were there, so if you wanted to take that mode of transportation you had to walk to Riverside. Overall, POFQ is still our favorite moderate resort at WDW, and upon check-in, when they said, \"Welcome Home\", it really did feel like coming home.

I had medication that must be refrigerated. One day when we came back to the room early, it had not yet been cleaned (that was about 3:00) and when she came to clean we just left and took a walk.

That day the bus was full and even though the bus driver asked if someone would give up their seats to us, no one did and my husband had to stand. Other days we always got a seat. The boat to downtown was a nice experience so we did that twice. The ice cream in the food court was a huge snack so we learned to share that and not get two of them.

Check in was quick and our room was ready before noon, which was a nice surprise but once inside the room, we were taken aback by the state of it. The furniture was banged up and there was so much dust in the corners of the headboard, our son was scraping it out with his fingernails. UGH! There was a large blob of old dried toothpaste on the curtain separating the dressing area from the sleeping quarters and there was a large hole in the shower curtain which was never replaced. My son actually wrote \"Clean Me\" in the dust on top of the TV! Even still, we chalked it up to an unmotivated housekeeper and decided to leave a tip for her/him in the hopes of getting better service. I left that tip in a clearly labled envelope on top of the tray on the dresser. It was still there the next day (didn't see it?), after our room was cleaned, as was the toothpast blob and the headboard dust. I then went directly to the concierge and explained the situation. He advised me that they would provide a VIP cleaning that evening while we were at dinner and apologized, explaining that they no longer had enough staff to provide the daily spot checks they once conducted. (Housekeeping spot checks are now done weekly) Upon our return from dinner we found the room cleaned and turn down service completed, but the housekeeper had taken the towels and didn't replace them so we had to send our son to the pool for more! We checked in on a Sunday and by Wednesday, I had decided to stop tipping since the torn shower curtain was still there, clothing tags were under the bed from the previous guests, there was an open water in the refrigerator (also from a previous guest), toiletries weren't replaced and we had received no towel art. The boat ride to downtown Disney is really scenic and relaxing and very convenient.

The New Orleans theme and the landscaping of the French Quarter really appealed to me. It definitely met my expectations and then some! When we initially arrived, we found we had a FedEx that required a signature that would need to be brought to our room, and also a delivery of water and other items, and my husband wanted extra hangers, and we were having trouble adjusting the temperature of our refrigerator and needed assistance with that as well. We were anxious to get out and about and were concerned that we'd be waiting around for deliveries, etc in our room for a long time. But everyone arrived very quickly -- we were so impressed! The staff was absolutely wonderful at this resort. The room was very clean and charming. As we departed for a park early every morning, I loved opening the door to dazzling sunshine and the beautiful, tranquil landscape of trees and cobblestone streets and horsehead \"hitching posts\". And there would be a cheerful doorman who would hand out a Mardi Gras coin to our five year old -- what a great way to start off the day! We later took her to the pretty fountain on the grounds so she could put her coin in and make a wish. She participated in the Pirate Cruise leaving from Port Orleans Riverside. We enjoyed a lovely walk on a sunny morning along the river to get there. My daughter absolutely loved the pirate cruise! When I arrived to pick her up, she just walked by and said \"It's not over yet.\" And it wasn't. The children had one more treasure chest to find, which was located in the Riverside Lobby. All of the children were having so much fun! This was a really wonderful experience for my daughter. She also loved the dragon slide at the pool. She had a lot of fun at the Wilderness Lodge pool as well, but this was her favorite. We all enjoyed the boat ride to and from Downtown Disney -- what a unique way to get to and from a shopping/restaurant area! The bus transportation from this resort was excellent as well. We never had to wait long for a bus to any of the parks. I can't say anything about the food court here because the only thing we bought here to eat were beignets. We were on the regular dining plan and would have a light breakfast in our room and lunch and dinner either at the parks or at other resorts or at Downtown Disney. The one thing that began to wear on us towards the end of our four night stay here was the double beds. We are accustomed to king-sized beds at home. And my daughter, being in a strange place, insisted that I sleep with her -- so my mother, daughter and myself wound up together in one double bed, if you can imagine that! But I knew about the double beds going in, which is why I scheduled the second half of our stay at the Wilderness Lodge Villas. I think if we were to do an entire stay at the French Quarter I would reserve two rooms for the four of us, just to ensure we all got a good nights sleep. Anyway, I just loved the tranquility and beauty of this resort, with jazz music quietly playing -- such a relaxing place to return to after a busy day in the parks.

Room was clean and everything worked which was most important. We missed having a balcony/patio as we normally do on European hols.The hotel foodcourt wasnt really a place we could enjoy a proper meal-paper plates and plastic cutlery. It was OK for a croissant /pastry or a quick snack. Get the souvenir mugs-theyre good value 12.99$ and you can refill at the hotel with hot+cold drinks. The pool area was nice. But it did get crowded in the afternoon (as it was school holidays). We used the Disney buses and even though it was Easter break and busy we always got on our bus. We made use of the Magic Hours and were up early most days but it was worth it. Used the riverboat loads for Downtown Disney-every 20mins fm 10-4 then every 10mins till 11.30pm.(Got a bit tired of the commentary on the new Disney Vacation Club Tree Houses!!!!). We were really near to Epcot and Downtown Disney fm this hotel. One thing we found though was that the Disney people werent very helpful when it came to asking how we get OFF the site to I-Drive without a car. 'Take a taxi' they said. They werent up to speed on the bus services-we found out ourselves from our 'Brits Guide' that the Lynx 50 from outside Downtown gets you to Seaworld and there you connect with the Lynx 8 to I -Drive and also the outlets malls in the opposite direction. Ask for transfers when you board the 50 and it costs you 2$ each way AD and 1$ KIDS.Downtown Disney was a bit too noisy and overpriced for us to enjoy a meal so we ate off site most nights. We walked to Riverside a few times. Its a nice walk or you take the riverboat. You can hire racer boats etc there and also eat in the foodhall if you wish to.

I had stayed at the Dolphin on another trip and thought that was the Disney way of doing things (I believe it was owned by Disney at the time) hotel-wise so I was expecting something just as fun.

I looked at little details like the lamp posts that were absolutely dirty, the paint on the doors was chipped and needed repainting. The walk areas by the rooms (on the different levels) were dirty and stained. The paint job in general is extremely drab and boring. I tried to like the resort and succumb to its supposed charm but I was truly underwhelmed. This was supposed to be a \"moderate level\" resort.

I would recommend people stay in building 2,3 or 4 in the future if you want to be closer to the pool and main building where the dining area is. Luckily we really didn't spend a lot of time here except to sleep and eat---but we woke up every morning with sore backs because of the beds. You can always tell the quality of a hotel by its towels, I believe and these towels were scratchy. Enough said. The positive things about this resort: It is small (some people think this is a plus) The waterway takes you on a free river cruise to Disney Downtown The pool is nice, life jackets are provided for younger children) There is a playground for the children (if you have time to spend at the resort) We saw a horse-drawn carriage taking people around, we didn't know how to use it, but we saw it Door men friendly Negatives: DIRTY exterior areas including light posts TIRED, WORN paint jobs nicked up furniture double-sized, uncomfortable beds drab painting parking not so fab...quite a distance to our rooms (we stayed in building 6)", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Adams, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWould love to stay here again\u201d", "Author": "myersj125", "ReviewID": "UR27000264", "Content": "Back from 5 nights at French Quarter.

Here is my take in short: For what you pay for the room $200-$250 a night, the hotel room (by itself) is woefully inadequate. When you add on the convenience and extras, it probably breaks even. Therefore, i'm stunned by the 5 star reviews and the 1 Star reviews. I stayed at this resort probably 15 years ago when it was called Dixie Landings. The room interior looks like very little has changed. The lighting is old, the furniture is beaten up, the sheets are very cheap, the TV is the old box version. This is all forgivable if the cost was cheaper. I am not suggesting that the rooms are inhabitable in anyway. It's just that they don't reflect what you'd expect for a similar hotel anywhere else in the world for $200-250 a night. What was not forgivable is that in this reluctance to update the hotel, there is a mold problem.My wife is highly allergic and had trouble sleeping. If we stayed for 7 days for a full vacation, i'd have been very annoyed. Especially since the next level up for a Deluxe hotel is only another $200 -$300 in the package cost. Therefore, it seems even more over priced in my mind. We were only there for 3 nights, so we just got benedryl and sucked it up without complaint. In the end, I thought about it in these terms. If I stayed at a similar hotel off the Disney resort and paid$89-$115 a night (the price i think a room like that should be priced), what would the cost of a car, the gas, the parking, the extra time traveling about, the lack of early admission and extra hours, etc have tacked on? I think in a dollar sense, it'd be close, but aggrevation of traveling etc, i would have been very upset. Additionally, one reason i wasn't too mad, was the value hotels aren't much cheaper. It's not like i booked a much more expensive room to stay in the moderate instead of value. Conclusion If i went back to disney, i would tell friends about the issues i had with the mold at Port Orleans, but i wouldn't tell people to avoid the place. If it fits your budget and you just want to be at Disney to avoid other headaches and don't envision spending a lot of time in your room, this hotel will be good. Pros: 1. Hotel staff - very good. The doormen have a lot of good advice if you want it. They are always smiling. 2. Hotel cleaning staff was really good. We tipped them and got some really exotic towel art and the room was as clean as it could be. Cons: 1. The mold 2. The safe is actually very very narrow. and it's actually a key as opposed to a keypad. Therefore, you have to schlep the key with you. And in the event you lose the key, they'll charge you. i didn't lose the key, so i don't know how much that is. but it's annoying to have that bulky key with you.", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cReview of Disney's Port Orleans Resort - French Quarter\u201d", "Author": "EarleNc", "ReviewID": "UR26332425", "Content": "We fully enjoyed out stay .

The double sinks was a huge plus with a teenager. They do need to upgrade the TV but only we were not in the room that much to care. We requested a Water view and that is what we got. We wanted a view of the river but got the pool view. So if you want a specific water view state that when booking. The Resort is quiet and breath-taking. The pool is great for kids. Even though we only visted it twice, we had a ball. Husband and I enjoyed a few nights at the Scat Cats bar. The jazz player was great. The food court is a standard food court. The staff was always helpful espically the conceirce service. The check-in line was quick and check-out was even faster. Disney Trans was great as well. I never waited very long for a bus. The only time we waited long was leaving Hollywood Studios after Fanstamic.. And at that it was only 15 minutes and Disney had 2 buses for our resort and Riverside. We had very early breakfasts and the buses got us there in great time. If you are going to Downtown Disney, I would take the Boat every time. It is a little longer but it is so worth it. We only waiting about 10 mins for a boat to come. Had no complaints about Mousekeeping. Only was disappointed that we only got 2 animals towels in our stay.

The people in the lobby were so polite and quick. The grounds, absolutely beautiful. We did have to wait until 3:00 to check in, but that was the time stated, so we just took a drive around to get situated.

We love the small setting, compared to the larger resorts. We were a group of seven, so we required two rooms. I asked for connecting (BTW, must ask for connecting rooms, adjoining is next to) and had them. Check in was a breeze. One of the rooms was ready, so we went to that room to drop off carry-on stuff. Not even an hour later, the second room was ready and all of our luggage was in the room. So far, this was more than we could ask for. We had a great couple of days, returning every day around 1pm from the parks for naps and rest. We were there for 6 nights and with four kids (Ages 7, 4 and 18 month twins), housekeeping of rooms is a necessity. The second day they arrived during nap times. We told them that this would be our time in the room each day. We collected trash and received new towels and they were on their way. The third day, they arrived at 7:45am, we were just about ready, and so we left for the morning. We returned to Mickey shaped and animal shaped towels. My older children were thrilled and loved them. The fourth day, they came at naptime again, after we had asked them for mid morning. The fifth day, they arrived at naptime again. With this, my wife called to complain and said that we would be leaving for the parks around 3:30pm and needed service, they never came. The sixth morning, my wife called again, she was assured that they would come in the morning ansd was told to \"have a magical day\". We arrived back from the parks and they had not come. I called this time and demanded that they come as soon as we left for the parks this day. We arrived back that night and they had not come. Rather than spoil our last night, we decided to let it go, but have since written letters to the General Manager of the hotel, Director of Operations for the Resorts, and the Director of Guest Relations. I believe that this problem is due to the incompetence of one or two employees out of the hundreds who were wonderful. I almost did not want to include this problem, but wanted to be fair to any other guests. The pool is really fun for kids, it has a great slide. The pool bar is great for adults and the bartenders are wonderful. Do not ever take the bus to Downtown Disney; there is a boat dock behind the pool. It is about a fifteen-minute ride and is awesome. If you end up at Downtown Disney, take the boat back. Buses to everywhere else came within ten minutes of getting to the bus stop. Some of the buses do stop at the Riverside resort on the way there if the bus is not full. On the way back, the bus from Disney Studios and Animal Kingdom stop at Riverside first. There is no restaurant at the resort, but the counter service is good. It does not have a great selection, but the friendliness of the staff was great.

This was a good base for touring the various Disney parks. The grounds are very nicely landscaped. Given the quality of the room, prices are definitely higher than you would expect to pay for the same quality of room outside of Disney. For the additional price you are getting the following benefits: * Use of the Disney bus and boat transportation systems, so you don\u2019t have to drive and pay for parking. * Purchases made in the park can be delivered to the motel\u2019s gift store. However, you must be staying for at least two nights from your time of purchase to make use of this. * Magic Hours - Early entry/late use of a specific park which is only available to Disney resort guests. However, some guides suggest not going to parks on the days which have the Magic Hours, so you might want to think about the value of what you\u2019re getting. * Ability to purchase a meal plan, which will get you some discounts on food. The word \u201cresort\u201d in the name is probably stretching the definition a bit. Large motel would probably be more accurate. There is a cafeteria-style dining, but no sit-down full service restaurant. The serving area is small and congested, and you will need to keep a sharp eye out for an available table during busy times. There is a small bar area, a video game arcade, and a gift shop. Food at the cafeteria was limited, and quite expensive. We were also disappointed at the amount of packaging used (everything is served on paper plates, which have a plastic lid put on top, plastic silverware, and everything is then thrown in the garbage). There was one recycling container for bottles, near the exit, but you had to hunt for it. Decorations consist of oversized plastic mardi gras style masks. The motel room was fairly clean, though I did find some debris from previous guests. The front doors of some the rooms were scraped and looked like they needed a coat of paint. Motel type amenities (small in-room refrigerator, coffee maker, hair drier) are provided. Soap and shampoo are provided, but not hand lotion. There is a nice design feature, which is a curtain which separates the sinks/changing area from the rest of the bedroom. This is nice to allow for a private changing area, and to allow one person to sleep in a bit while the other showers or changes. Staff were helpful, and knowledgeable about park activity times. The room was generally quiet, which was appreciated after some long days of touring the parks. However, we did hear the sound of toilets flushing from the rooms around us. Also, we were there during a colder spell, so didn\u2019t have to deal with people lingering on the porch/walkway which runs in front of the rooms, which has been a complaint of other reviewers. Like all of the Disney hotels/motels, this one is large (but smaller than some of the other properties), so try to get a room relatively close to the bus stop and cafeteria to minimize long walks at the beginning and end of each day. The pool is quite large and fun for kids. Lifeguards were on hand, and appeared to be vigilant. There is also a hot tub. A pleasant trail winds alongside the river, which is nice if you\u2019re looking for a quiet place to get away from things for a bit. We didn\u2019t spend much time at the motel, and only used it as a place to sleep and have breakfast. For us, it was nice not having to rent a car, and just using the Disney transport system and having our purchases delivered. We also fully used the meal plan we had purchased. We also planned to eat dinners at various restaurants in different hotels and parks, so were not concerned about the lack of a full service restaurant.

We really liked that the whole Disney thing wasn't shoved in your face at this resort, as it really seemed like a hotel instead of part of Disneyworld. Downsides were the poor beds, which really belonged at a sleezy motel rather than a resort with aspirations of grandeur. The just-about-bearable beds were complimented by the worst pillows too, also befitting a sleezy motel. At least they very quickly replaced them with feather pillows when asked, which improved our sleep. This hotel is very quiet at night, but the bar and jacuzzi areas were quite lively. The other big negative here is that the restaurant is cafeteria style, which is fine for breakfast maybe.

From beginning to end service and amenities were all great. There are many negative comments here so as I write my review I will comment on these other viewpoints. CHECK-IN: Yes, when we arrived at 2 pm there was a line but it moved swiftly and the check in person who helped us was friendly, full of info taking time to prepare us for all we needed to know. Most inportant, they upgraded us to a RIVER VIEW room free of charge when we didn't even ask for it. THE ROOM: The room was well decorated and the set up was lovely. The seperation from the bath and sleeping area was much appreciated. The beds were ultra soft and the decor was fresh and not at all dated. MOUSEKEEPING: There have been many complaints about the housekeeping at this resort. Our first full day there we left early - around 8 am and returned around 3 pm. Our room had not been cleaned yet and I was not pleased. There is a card in the room saying housekeeping will come any time between 8 and 4:30. I called housekeeping and discussed my displeasure. The maid was there within 5 minutes and I explained to her our schedule and what time of day we would like our room cleaned. She was very agreeable and for the rest of the stay our room was cleaned late morning while we were out. Bathroom was always spotless, animals left, soft sheets and soaps etc. always plentiful. THE GROUNDS: This resort is truly like being away from Disney. It is all cobblestoned streests, very quiet and peaceful. What a wonderful retreat after tiring days. We often felt as if we were the only ones there. We have stayed at the economy resorts before and this was a 100% improvement. THE FOOD COURT: I really liked the food court. many are upset there is no sit down restaurant here. We ventured over to the Boatwright Dining Hall a couple of times and it was always crowded, crazy, loud and cumbersome. Even wih a reservation we were not seated. The food court even at its busiest time was friendly, fast and the food was not like a cafeteria. it was all fresh and made before your eyes. Burgers were great and highly recommend the huge chicken ceasar salad. Definitely a bonus when wanting to stay on the grounds for a meal. You could eat there or bring it back to your room. BOTTOM LINE: I highly recommend this resort. Seems many people are desiring ultra deluxe. if that is what you want, stay at a deluxe resort.

The staff was great, esp the 2 men standing at the doors of the lobby every day handing out coins for the fountain. Sometimes the buses would go straight to the parks after picking us up, other times we would make several stops. We never had to wait too long for a bus. The boat will take you to downtown disney or riverside only, not the parks. Everyone says you won't be in the rooms much, but my daughter was sick one day and I was glad we had a nice room.

Stayed 7 nights here; daughter and son-in-law joined us the last 5 nights. As a late book, we had a choice of this Disney resort or Carribbean Beach as everything else was booked. We usually stay @ a deluxe level Disney (usually go every 4-5 years) so were pleasantly surprised with French Quarter. We do have an issue with double beds as hubby is pretty good sized but needed the 2 beds and really prefer to stay ON Disney for the convenience. It was very easy for hubby to catch a cab each AM ($12-15 one way). I have to say the beds were really our only issue and, since we knew that going in, I'm still giving this resort a 5. Everything was clean, comfortable, and convenient. The pool area is a delight with all the frolicking alligators, slides, and fountains. We were there during a particularly cold time - below 30 3 nights - and the staff covered flower beds and moved planters up close to the buildings to try to save them. I think they were successful as I didn't see any black leaves. Hubby still hit the heated pool and hot tub every day though. There were just a few northerners braving it. The pictures show the decor as garish I think but it's really not, just fun. We were in building 5, on the back side from the pool, over the courtyard and with an angled view of the river, #5339. Highly recommend the bottomless coffee cup that you can fill for free during your visit at the cafe. It's $12.50 plus tax but, if you'll be there for a few days and don't mind sharing, well worth it. The cafe has some healthy choices but @ Disney prices. They sell pizza, a couple of dinner salads, sandwiches, beer by the bottle, ice cream, cookies, single serve cereals, milk, ready-to-eat packs of grapes, carrots, etc. We packed instant oatmeal, bowls, and spoons so we could heat water in the room coffeepot (it's just a 4 cupper) for breakfast. There is also a mini-fridge, no microwave in the room but one in the cafe. There is a separate potty/tub room off the sink area; the sink area has a curtain that can be pulled to make a separate changing area. It was handy while hubby was getting ready in the AM before the rest of us were up. The boat to the Marketplace is a very pleasant ride and picks up every 20-30 minutes. Our daughter is a distance runner and used the stone path along the river each day. It's a mile out and back @ French Quarter and connects to a .7mi loop @ Riverside. She needed a few of those to get her mileage in but, heh, whatever works. I walked it one day and had an employee in a golf cart stop and ask if I wanted a ride. It's very quiet and beautiful along the river but still in sight of the buildings so feels quite safe. We made Disney dining reservations before we left home as I'd read that they can fill up. The whole resort isn't overly large and is all centered around the cafe/reservations/gift shop building. You can catch buses to all the resorts and water parks right out front of that. They're usually pretty regular, about a 20 minute wait if you've just missed one for your destination. We did see 2 MK buses back-to-back one morning and waited maybe 30 minutes that day for a Hollywood Studios bus (or did it just seem that long because it was so darn cold?). We did notice that all the parks seem to have the FQ buses at the other end of their pavilions, so a bit longer walk there. Disney Express also picks up out front on the other side of the building. We arrived just after midnight at the end of the work week so were beat that day and thankful we didn't have to drive. The Disney employees working at the airport to load those buses were very friendly and nice. It's always interesting to hear where those folks originated and their story of landing at Disney so ask! We did have a bit of trouble finding the Express bus area - we knew it was @ ground transportation but turned the wrong way off the escalator and didn't see any signs to direct. It's a long walk to the other end at 12:30AM! Registration was fairly smooth but just one employee on duty. Had to stop the next day to get our late-ordered park tickets as concierge was, of course, closed. The 3 people @ the concierge desk that day told me I had to go to On Call @ the park to pick up the tickets and they couldn't retrieve them and add them to our room key, even with the confirmation number. When our daughter and son-in-law arrived 2 days later, I mentioned it while they were checking in and was told that, yes, they certainly could do that. We weren't starting @ the parks until the next day so retrieved hubby's key card and added everything onto both our keys. Much handier than having to keep 2 cards apiece. Not sure why none of the first 3 knew of that capability. The outside entry is so much more convenient than waiting for elevators in the deluxe resorts. We were on the top floor (3rd) and just used the elevator when we had our suitcases with us. That could be an issue of you have trouble with stairs We liked this resort so much that we're hoping Disney will either upgrade to queen beds or the kids will be able to afford their own room in a few years so we can upgrade to a king room.", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alabama", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "TravelLover429", "ReviewID": "UR24103491", "Content": "This was our first stay at Disneyworld.

We can remember the last time we saw a hotel rooms so clean and spacious before (for the money we pay) as we have travel around the world.

Bus service to the parks and Downtown Disney were very accurate, less than 20 minutes wait for any bus to take you anywhere. The boat ride to Riverside and Downtown Disney was quick and fun.

I've been and stayed at Disney World on 23 different occasions since 1985 and this was the absolute worst experience I've ever had. We checked in to POFQ 12/23/2008 and were very excited because we've read so many nice things about it online in different places. When we got to the hotel around 10 am and our room wasn't ready and the front desk told us we'd have to wait until 3 pm. That's very normal for Disney hotels, so we were fine. We went to the parks at 11 pm, got our hotel room number, and went up to our room. The room was absolutely filthy. There was hair all over the floor of the sink area, in the bathtub/toilet area, and in the bathtub itself. The floor was all smudged and had dirt marks on it too. Plus, on the carpeted area by the beds, there were six fingernails in different locations on the floor... it was clear the floor of the room had NOT been cleaned. The worst part was when we pulled down the sheets and there was a lot of hair in the sheets in BOTH of the beds. Plus there were some other nasty things in the sheets I'd prefer not to even mention. My husband complained to the front desk and they gave us a new room in a new building still at POFQ. In that room, the floor and bathroom were clean, but both of the beds had hair under the pillowcases and some in between the sheets. We decided to leave POFQ and stay at a different Disney resort. By this time it was 12:30. The manager was not helpful and wanted us to A. take her to the rooms and show her the hairs and nails, and B. keep checking different rooms until we found a clean one we would stay in. After an hour and a half (literally) of discussion/arguments with the manager, we finally were able to have the money we paid for that night transferred to the new hotel as a credit, which the manager did NOT want to do.

I had called the week before our arrival to make a couple requests such as the building we wanted and the floor which I based on some of the reviews I had read. When we arrived for check-in, the building and floor that was assigned to us was no where near what I had requested. I thought to myself this was the beginning of all the bad reviews I had read!! I told the castmember these accomadations were nothing like I had requested and were not acceptable.

We went to our room, and again, after reading some of the bad reviews, I was not expecting anything great. July in Florida was extremely hot and humid, but as soon as my husband opened our door, we were greeted by a wonderfully cool room!! We had a king-sized bed which was exceptionally comfortable.

They did however, leave a bag with clean towels, soap, coffee, etc. on our door 3 of the 5 days we were there. The boat ride to Downtown Disney is very nice and relaxing!! The bus service does leave alot to be desired. That is just about the only complaint I can think of. Sharing the bus with the neighboring resort, Riverside, is not a very good idea!!

Check-In: We arrived at the hotel around 1:30 on a Friday and the check-in line was a few people deep. The line moved pretty quickly and the actual check-in process was a breeze. Room: We were on the 3rd floor of building 5. When I booked our room, I booked a standard view room using the rationale that I wouldn't be in the room except to sleep, so why pay more for the view. I was surprised to find our room was a corner room with two windows facing the river that runs along the property. The room location was ideal. It was quiet and peaceful. Additionally, Building 5 was still close enough to the common areas of the resort that it was a brief walk to the pool, food court, bus stop, etc. Hotel Grounds: The grounds were very nice with manicured lawns and fountains throughout the property. It was a pleasant environment to walk around and was lit very nicely at night. Pool: We used the pool/hot tub one day and it was a fun design with the dragon slide and alligator fountains. The pool was pretty empty during the day, since it was December. I imagine it might get cramped during business seasons. Food: We ate breakfast in the food court twice and a late lunch there one day. The food was pretty standard for Disney. Nothing was outstanding, but nothing was bad. The food court seemed small to me, but it was never particularly crowded which was a plus. Transportation: The bus stop was a close walk to our room and we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a bus leaving the resort. A few times there were long waits coming back from the parks, but I feel that it is to be expected. We also took the boat to Downtown Disney from the resort. It was a very pleasant ride through a part of WDW I had never seen before. On the ride back from Downtown Disney we had a boat captain who had been with the company since 1972. He told the best stories about the early years of WDW and was a real pleasure. Overall, it was a fantastic four days at the Port Orleans French Quarter.

We stayed in building 4, very convenient to the bus stop, and while technically it overlooked a parking lot on our side, it was buffered by bushes and grass. The other side of the building would have been prettier as it overlooked the grassy square and fountain. The pool was nice sized and interesting, many areas were 3 foot 6 inches deep so my kids could touch down. Fun dragon slide, well life guarded. There was a nice hot tub tucked behind a boxwood hedge with a lions head shower. The theming was great. Laundry room right near the pool open 24 hours. A nice arcade, lounge area with live music some nights. You can book a horse and carriage ride, catch a boat launch to Downtown Disney (very commercial, I hated Planet Hollywood) or a boat to Riverside the adjoining resort. Kids get Mardi Gras style beads and wishing coins on arrival. Food court was nice, good breakfasts, and late night bites, no complaints (except the Nescafe, make coffee in your room!). My kids did not like the huge fiberglass heads hanging for decoration, I guess they were a bit scary. We had dinner at Boatwrights at Riverside which was walking distance. Nice service, food was variable (I think that might have been Minute Rice and margarine on the table!) The room was also nicely themed, newly decorated. Mousekeeping was sufficient. We tipped a bit each night. Last day our mousekeeper checked in with us as we were leaving, but not prior to this. Buses were quick and reliable, we never waited more than 10 minutes the whole trip.

The Disney Magical Express was very convenient, yes it can take up to 3 hours for your bags to arrive, but Disney makes this VERY clear in the documentation that you receive, it sure beats standing at the baggage claim! FOOD: Disney does tend to nickel-and-dime you. There is no continental breakfast. I think the restaurant gets a bad rap from some of the other reviewers. The local restaurant offers a variety of food options and it does tend to be slightly over-priced but the food is the same quality as most any other park restaurant that doesn't offer table service. The staff here was really quite friendly even in the face of some demanding guests that I observed. There is a restaurant with table service at Port Orleans Riverside; we found the food there to be somewhat mediocre. ROOM: Our room was on the third (top) floor and we paid $20.00 extra for a water view. We found it to be clean and well maintained and, above all else, it was quiet! Internet service was available for about $9.00 for 24hours use. The room has a strong box/safe, refrigerator, double-sinks. The room was rather spacious but the beds were on the smaller side. POOL: The pool was cute and the kids seemed to like it. It was designed to look like a Mardi Gras float. There was a charge for a locker. It was a little too cold for us to use the pool. STAFF: All around we found the staff to be very friendly. TRANSPORTATION: The free boat that runs between Downtown Disney, Port Orleans Riverside, and Port Orleans French Quarter was timely and convenient. We never had to wait long for the boat and it ran fairly late into the evening. The park buses could be a little crowded at times. Sometimes we had to wait up to 20 minutes for the bus we wanted. The day that Epcot opened early we saw the bus for the Magic Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, and two Animal Kingdom buses before the Epcot bus arrived. MAGIC EXPRESS: Having the Express deal with the bags to and from the airport was very convenient. We also were able to get our boarding passes at the hotel (we chose an airline specifically so that we could take advantage of this) This was stress free! At the hotel, the Magic Express bus stop is in front of Bell Services near the main entrance. When we first arrived at the Orlando Airport (at the start of our trip) we found the Disney Express Welcome center to be somewhat difficult to find (there is a lack of signage) having the directions that Disney had mailed to us prior to our trip was helpful in pointing us in the right direction. OTHER ADVANTAGES: Staying on the Disney property allows you to enter certain parks early, or you can stay late at certain parks (the concierge can help you determine which parks will open early/late while you are there). You will need your room key to take advantage. Purchases made throughout the parks can be sent back to your hotel's gift shop (as long as you are not leaving the next day), this is also convenient. PARK TIPS: Magic Kingdom: If you want to try to eat at Cinderella's Table (in the castle), make reservations early! We were there in November and their next table was in January! Monster Inc's comedy show is impressive. Animal Kingdom: A bug's Life, the Safari, and Expedition Everest are all very cool! Epcot: The World Showcase is awesome; the restaurants with table service have above average food for the park! Disney's Hollywood Studios: Tower of Terror, Aerosmith's Rockin' Rollercoaster, and Toy Story are great! Skip Drew Carey, it was boring and a waste of time (too bad since Drew can be very funny), it did not live up to the Disney brand.

We requested a standard room with 2 beds. Overall, our trip was not as fun as it could have been, but that's for another board. At first we were put in Building 1, room 1235, which had a sort of river view. Our luggage took 3 hours to get to our room, so I would recommend not letting Magical Express get it at the airport to deliver later. Upon arrival, we noticed that the room as not particularly clean. There was mold in the bathroom along with long hair from a previous occupant in the tub and, uck, on towels. The sheets had holes in them. While I thought maybe this was the old time New Orleans experience, DW was not impressed. There are no 2 queen rooms, so we were in a double bed, and we like our space at night so this was also a drawback. That night the ceiling fan rattled like it was going to come out of the ceiling, and our upstairs neighbor flushed their very loud (all are loud) toilet what seemed every 15 minutes, keeping DW awake. So, in the morning I requested that we be moved to a 3rd floor room somewhere else that didn't have the problems we noticed. The front desk staff readily accommodated the request, but more or less said we had to move our own stuff unless we wanted to wait until Bell Services could get around to it. We packed our things and moved over to building 3, room 3347 which was closer to the main building, but our room now had a view of a parking lot. However, it was clean and other than a neighbor prone to coughing fits was quiet for the rest of the trip. The room was identical to the other one. The air system worked fine, we had good water pressure and it appeared that they have done something to lessen the swampy smell and taste of their water from our last trip. The TV only has a few non-Disney stations, but does have front inputs if you bring a portable DVD. We were usually exhausted by the end of the day so it didn't matter much other than checking the weather. Check out was really easy, as we did the express option. Magical Express required our bags by 11 am for our 3pm flight, so we had to get packed early to use the resort airline check-in. Also ME leaves 3 hours before your flight so we had 2 hours to kill after we passed security so if we have a later flight next time we may send the bags but take a cab. We didn't have to stand in line at the airport except for security, which was convenient. Resort Amenities Pool - looked nice, we had record cold so didn't use it. Food Court - Small, but food was decent. Soda still tastes funny, I think it's the water - all Coke products throughout the property (including the parks). We got the mugs, but didn't use them enough to justify the cost - convenient though. If not on the meal plan, prices are just a hair above reasonable. Lunch for 3 would run around $45.00 or less. Gift Shop - Disney is a shopping mall with rides, so we only used the gift shop for necessities, which it had what we needed. Lounge - Intimate, but expensive. $8.75 for a hurricane, $6.50 for a draft Abita. Entertainment from Wednesday - Saturday. Water Taxi - This was a nice touch, we had several excursions to Downtown Disney so we used the boat a couple of times - a pleasant 15 minute trip, unless it's 40 degrees... Bus Service - there is only one bus stop at POFQ compared to four at POR. Depending on where you're going, you may have to sit through the other resort stops. We were really lucky, and never waited long for a bus, and most we took didn't go through POR, but when they did it adds 10 minutes to your trip at least. Staff Friendliness - mixed. I believe we have had better overall service previously, but still above non-Disney hotels. So, overall it was an okay resort, but we probably wouldn't stay there again. I have stayed at all the Moderates now, and have to say that Coronado Springs was probably the best experience I have had - but it's a huge resort and that presents it's own issues.

The atmosphere there is very laid back and it is just beautiful!!! We got our room keys and went up to our room which was surprisingly close the the main entrance so we were very happy. The room was adorable. It was very cozy and clean. It also had a small refrigerator which was very nice to have. There were two sinks so we each had our own which was nice. It was just a really nice room for the price. After the first day, we made our way down to the food court area and the we were very impressed. You could get pretty much whatever you wanted and the food was very good. The staff was very friendly throughout the hotel and everyone was very accomodating. The front desk gave us Just Married pins and every castmember that we saw congratulated us. It was such a magical experience!!!! The pool was amazing with a huge dragon slide draping over the whole pool. We didn't go in during the day because we were in the parks but we went over a couple nights and it wasn't crowded at all. Very relaxing!!! And just behind the pool area the riverboats that go over to Downtown Disney and Riverside. It was so nice to be able to take a nice boat ride over to Downtown Disney instead of one of the buses. We had an amazing honeymoon that we will remember for the rest of our lives!!!!

This stay at Port Orleans French Quarter was our fourth stay at this resort. Check-in was a breeze! We arrived so early that our room wasn't ready yet, but we were given our keys/tickets and a phone number to call after 3:00 p.m., at which time we'd be given our room number. We simply left our luggage in the car, headed for the Magic Kingdom, and came back late that evening after being assigned our room. We stayed in Building 5, room 5108. This is a prime location, as it is literally a 30-second stroll from the pool, the hot tub, the food court, the store, the laundry facilities, and guest services. That being said, French Quarter is one of Disney's smaller resorts--no room is very far from the facilities. This is one of the main reasons we choose this particular resort. The room was big enough to accomodate a family of four comfortably. We had two queen beds, a compact refrigerator, a table, a dresser, and additional shelving/hangers in the bathroom area. The bathroom area has a privacy curtain you can use which separates it from the rest of the room. This was a great advantage in a hotel room with two teenaged girls! The decor in the rooms is cute, if a little kitschy. The bedspreads are designed with Mardi Gras masks, balloons, streamers, beads, etc. There are even \"hidden Mickeys\" on them, if you look closely. The food court, called \"Sassagoula Floatworks,\" is very nice, with an extensive choice of foods. One can get anything from hot dogs and pizza to barbeque ribs and pot roast. There is a good selection of dessert items, too, and we highly recommend the beignets! The Castmembers at the food court were always cheerful and helpful, and the eating area was always neat and clean. There is no \"sit-down\" restaurant at Port Orleans French Quarter. The pool is enormous! There is a huge water slide for the kids, a waterfall, a bridge,and plenty of room to spread out! The deepest part of the pool is a little over four feet. There lots of lounge chairs, beach towels are available at poolside, and the bar is nearby for more mature tourists. There is also a kiddie-pool and a hot tub. The store is part gift shop, part convenience store. One can buy anything from tee-shirts and snow globes to a bottle of Pepto-Bismol. We found the Castmembers there to be as helpful and friendly as those in the food court. The ambiance of this resort is also a huge selling point for us. It is landscaped to closely resemble the French Quarter in New Orleans: cobblestone streets/walkways, black wrought iron fences, fountains, lush flower beds, and pastel paint on the buildings. Dixieland jazz music is always playing in the food court, the pool area, and guest services. The resort is situated on the \"Sassagoula River,\" and there are boat rides available to Downtown Disney. It's a pleasant, 20-minute ride--the gentlemen driving the boats were entertaining and genuinely nice! Bus service to and from the parks was excellent! Port Orleans French Quarter is small enough that it has only one bus stop. It sometimes shares buses with Port Orleans Riverside, but this wasn't the case during our trip. I think the longest we waited on a bus was about 15 minutes when leaving the Magic Kingdom. Check-out at this resort (and any Disney resort) can be easily done if you are paying by credit card. Guest services simply hangs a copy of the bill on your door early on the morning you're due to check out. You don't have to go through the hassle of returning to guest services; it's all done ahead of time. I had only two VERY minor complaints about this resort: when we checked in, there was some sort of sticky white goo on the table, the refrigerator, and the bedside table. I think someone had spilled milk. Anyway, I cleaned it up myself and left a note for the \"mousekeeper\" the next morning. She wrote another kind note, and left four candy bars by way of apology. We had no other \"mousekeeping\" issues while there. My other complaint was our building itself: the outside paint looked a little worn-out. The paint was chipped off our door in spots, and you could see this was true of other buildings, too. They could have used a little sprucing-up. However, neither of these SMALL problems detracted from our vacation one bit. Yes, this is a long review, but it's due to my enthusiasm for Port Orleans French Quarter!

That way you can take the bus from the PARK to the HOTEL (very fast) and then take the BUS to whichever park has late hours. Take advantage of late hours (or not) and catch the bus back to FQ.

We went to get some coffee from the shop but unfortunatly, it was closed. At 4.30 am they were supposed to open but they wernt. The pool was great but a bit sandy and dirty but was big with a slide for younger children, it was a great swimming pool but unreliable lifeguards who are hardly there most of time so we had to look after the kids.

The food court there is fairly basic and the food a bit naff but ok.

Rooms were clean but a bit shabby if honest. However it was good enough for \"moderate\" accommodation. I can't understand why movies are not offered on the TV as a pay per view as Disney is missing a trick in getting money here as I think it would be a nice extra to have had. The TV channel is updated with park times etc which was useful. The plus point about this hotel is the river and the boats. If you can get a river view room and use the boats to get to Downtown Disney as that was such a lovely relaxing way to travel.

We arrived on the 7th September and checked-in to the resort at around 6.30pm. Check-in was quiet and we were quickly and efficiently given our 'Key to the World' cards. We were allocated room 6321 in building 6 on the 3rd floor (top floor). Initial impressions were very good, there was a beautiful grass courtyard directly outside the room, with a view of the water to the left. The room was comfortable and clean, the beds were very comfortable although the bathroom was a little small. The room had double sinks and a privacy curtain which was very useful and made the bathroom area much larger. The room had a small refrigerator which we filled with bottled water from Walmart, a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, in-room safe and a great air-conditioning system. The resort itself was absolutely beauiful and very peaceful. The swimming pool was great with plenty of pool towels to use. The pool never got overly busy which was really nice for a Disney hotel, (we stayed at Pop Century last year and never used the pool as it was so busy all the time). The walk over to the Riverside section of the resort is lovely, and you are allowed to use all the facilities of Riverside also. The food court was good and kept clean and tidy during the course of the day. The food was not spectacular but edible!!!. The boat service to Downtown Disney was also very nice although quite often the boats were very busy as they would load passengers from Riverside first, the head down to French Quarter. My only issues with the resort were: 1. Housekeeping: We left a $4 tip everyday but the housekeeping service was very hit and miss. Some days we were never left any coffee, other days the beds were made very poorly indeed. We resorted to leaving housekeeping a note every morning with instructions like: 'Please could you leave us with cups for the coffee maker' and 'Please do not place used bath towels back on the rail when they have been placed in the bath'. I felt for the amount we were paying for the room per night, the standard was very low. 2. Bus service. The bus service was generally very good, my only issue was with the service back to the hotel from Downtown Disney. We went to DD one afternoon and getting back to the resort took 45 minutes!. The bus stopped at Pleasure Island, Typhoon Lagoon, all 4 stops at Riverside before ending the journey at French Quarter. The service is exactly the same in the evening (missing out Typhoon Lagoon which is closed in the evening ). My recommendation is to always get the boat back to POFQ from DD, the boats run until 11pm and is much quicker.

The pool looks much bigger in the photo on the website and we thought the view from our room was going to be a bit more spectacular.

It's a beautiful property to walk around, especially at night!! However, when we got to our room, we were disappointed. First of all- someone else's luggage was in our room, and the poor bellhop was trying to sort it out. The rooms are motel-style, and every review I've read about dirty rooms at this resort was spot-on!! The bathtub did not drain (had to stand in dirty water), the grout in the sink area was disgusting/bathroom floor was dirty, and housekeeping was horrible at replenishing soap/coffee/you-name-it! We didn't have soap, shampoo, coffee or coffee cups at all on the first day. They only change the sheets EVERY 4 DAYS unless you specifically request otherwise...I thought that was surprising. The pool was very beautiful, and we loved Scat Cats (the lounge). We saw a fantastic jazz musician there one night, and hung out with a great couple from Scotland all night. That was the highlight of our trip! Food court was nothing special at all, and the masks hanging from the ceiling were very creepy/tacky....we walked down to Riverside to their food court- which had more options, and a very pleasant atmosphere.

Sometimes, we would be picked up at the one bus stop at Port Orleans and go directly to the particular park, stopping at Blizzard Beach. Other times, the bus would pick up the guests at the French Quarter bus stop, then drive all the way through the much larger Riverside resort. This added significant time to our bus ride.

We stayed in building 1, Rooms 1245 and 1246 (interconnecting). Our first morning, on leaving the room, we left a friendly note for the \"Mousekeeper\" and a $2 tip, as past expericen has shown that to do this means you get a good service. We have two kids, one of 10 and one of 7, and they love coming back to the rooms to see what has been done in terms of arranging their toys, towels in animal shapes etc. On arriving back, however, the tip was gone, but nothing special had been done. We then had to find a missing shoe, so looked under the bed \"curtains\", and found old Cheerios and Popcorn, and loads of dust! In the bathroom area, the floor was also grotty, and a piece of strawberry from the previous nights fruit which missed the bin was still there! Yuk! Also, the coffee machine had not been cleaned or the coffee replenished. I mentioned this to a concierge, who promised to look into it, and the next day, the room smelt of bleach when we returned...but the Cheerios and popcorn were still there! So we left another note specifically asking for this to be removed (which it was the next day). The rest of our stay (we stayed for 19nights) was a bit hit and miss with the cleaning, but we gave up nagging. The final straw came when we were packing to go home and found that my daughter's pink \"milly\" cat which she has had for 7 years was missing-it was always kept on her bed...we believe it got caught up with the bedding on a bedding change day. My daughter was distraught, but we had a plane to catch! On our return, I called the hotel who put me thru to \"Lost & Found\"...I left a voicemail (they never answer the phone), pleading for some help, but got no repsonse. I also contacted our Virgin rep out there, who also had to leave a message, but nothing.

The best meal we had though was at Cinderella's Royal Table. Hands down the best dessert we had in WDW. We did make use of the riverboat 2x. Once from DTD to our hotel and the 2nd time from Riverside to the FQ. The one thing that really grated on us for the resort was the awful wait times for the front desk. We experienced on several ocassions where we had to wait over 20 min or so to be helped. We were the 2nd or next in line even. We did have great maid service. The gal servicing our rooms was very pleasant and accommodating. She left us several towel animals which she told us we were welcome to take any/all of them home with us! The AC in the room worked beyond super well...and the ceiling fan kept us super chilly! We loved how comfy the beds were! We also loved having two sinks and the curtain to make a little dressing area. We used a grocery delivery company to deliver water and other things the day we arrived so that we could eat bagels/bananas in our rooms in the morning along w/ taking cold water with us every morning.

We also noticed there were a lot of rude and impolite service employees and cast members in FL compared to what we were used to in CA-Disneyland. We took two tours while we were there as well.

We loved being able to take a nice boat ride to Downtown Disney. One night, we didn't make it onto one of the larger boats back to the hotel from Downtown Disney, so this other guy told us he had room for us on a smaller pontoon that was quieter and had cushy seats. That was a bonus! The buses to the parks were usually on time, and there was always room for us to get on. It is a bonus that the buses stop at French Quarter before stopping at Riverside.

The food court at Riverside is much, much larger and only a short walk or boat ride away. Nice bars at the pool and inside by the food court with live entertainment Wed-Sat. Be sure to take the boat over to Downtown Disney. We really enjoyed the smaller size of this resort. The only negative thing I have to report is one night about 11:30 p.m. I was sitting near the pool area and saw a rather large rat scurry across the patio area from one bush to another. There weren't many people in the pool and I suspect he came out of the \"river\" to look for food. Still, not what you want to see when you're on vacation!

The pool is amazing and loved by the little one , hours of fun going round and round the slide, the only downside at times was after a long day walking round and round the parks you want to relax and swim and getting a seat around the pool can be very hard, it fills up very quick, the good use of hotel towels supplied at the pool side ment that sometimes people left these on the beds and you never knew if they were taken or not, and if you left your towels whilst you went for a dip and left no bags or shoes etc there you may come back to no bed as the life guards remove them, but overall a lovely place and good security for kids as there is a constant life guard till about 10 pm.

This was my first time staying at a Disney on-site hotel and my expectations were high.

The walk to the room was very nice as the grounds are well maintained and the pool area is beautiful. Once we got to the room, I was a disappointed in its condition. There were obvious dirt marks on the furniture and the carpet was dingy. I knew we had gotten in early and clean rooms were hard to get into at that time of the morning so, with my kids anxious to get to EPCOT, we headed out without complaint. I had hoped the Housekeeper would remedy the issues with the next cleaning. Day two and after 14 hours at the Magic Kingdom we returned to find the room in the same condition with the exception of the beds being made and the linens refreshed. Usually I would file a complaint, but at midnight, I knew it was useless so I waited until morning. The next morning I registered my complaint with the Front Desk Supervisor who told me my room would be perfect for the rest of my stay. She quickly offered an adjustment on my bill, which I was not looking for, but graciously accepted. After a third day of enjoying the park #3, we returned to the room to find it had not gotten the deep cleaning I requested. I promptly called and asked to speak to the Housekeeping Manager and asked him to come up to the room so he could see what condition the Housekeeper was leaving the room in on a daily basis. He was in the middle of another situation at the Riverside and promised he would be to my room as quickly as possible. He was there promptly and agreed that there was no way the room met the standards of the hotel and he comped my night on the spot as a result. He offered to have someone clean my room, but since it was after 9pm and we had already been there for two nights, it would have been pointless, since we were checking out at the end of the third night. In addition to the comped night, he did arrange for a late check-out for us. Aside from the hotel room, the remainder of the hotel is wonderful. We took advantage of the Disney food plan and ate breakfast at the local restaurant every morning. The meals were tasty and filling. The service was excellent and the atmosphere festive, with a Mardi Gras theme. The grounds are wonderfully maintained and very shady with lots of trees to shade the area. The pool is large, clean and was enjoyed by all. The resort is not on the monorail system though so getting to and from the parks requires a wait for a shuttle bus to take guests back and forth. If they ran a little more frequently, that would be a bonus, but other than that, it was fine. The resort also has a direct link to Downtown Disney via a water taxi. The 15 minute ride is relaxing and enjoyable, with Downtown Disney offering many options for dining and shopping. Aside from the room debacle, I would say we enjoyed our stay at the Port Orleans French Quarter.

Would recommend buying the Disney cup $12.95 but then you refill this with hot or cold beverages throughout your stay (usually $1.99 a time) - very worthwhile if you are staying for a week or more and a great souvenir. The pizza delivery to your room is excellent - fast friendly service and the pizza is amazing! The transportation to the parks was very good (buses every 20 minutes though so time it) and the buses stopped at French Quarter first before going on to the larger resort at Riverside. There was a great little boat service to Downtown Disney (took about 20 minutes) and this was delightful and very relaxing. The boats ran from early morning until 11.30pm. This resort is close to EPCOT. The resort has the New Orleans jazz/blues theme and the onsite bar 'Scatcats' was a welcome sight after a long day in the parks. The bar was immaculate and offered a good selection of drinks including a cocktail menu (which I worked my way through during the two weeks - recommend Captain's Mai Tai, Pina Colava, Raspberry Mojito and Sunken Treasure, mmmmmmm!). Nice ambience and entertainment provided most nights of the week which was a bonus. My son had arranged this accommodation for us and it did not disappoint - excellent service, excellent accommodation, good food and excellent environment/surrounding.

Twenty years ago, i stayed at the Carribean Beach resort, which at the time I loved, and still have fond memories of. This trip i booked Port Orleans due to some bad reviews about the poor aging of the CBR. Because I love the shore, CBR was a better fit for me, since they have a beach on site. However, I have few disappointments with Port Orleans. The Mardi Gras scenery definitely lives up to its name. The rooms were average for a hotel of its kind, nothing special, nothing bad. The pool was nice (not quite as spectacular as some lead you to believe), but for all the people who stay at the resort, it wasn't too crowded. The river boat to downtown disney was nice....on one trip, my girls were given special co-captain badges for good behavior. My only complaint was the chaotic food court. Meal times were EXTREMELY busy, with no assemblance of order behind the counter. The food was good, especially the beignets( a must for any fried dough lover). The best part was the small walking distance between everything. We were in building 7, the furthest one, and still did not have far to get to anything. Buses were good because French Quarter is the first pick up location on most trips. One day, our family took a stroll to riverside, the sister resort. It was definitely busier and more crowded. However, there was much more activities to enjoy. The buildings were much more spread out, but seemed very nice as well.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doylestown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBest Moderate Resort at Disney!\u201d", "Author": "agscott", "ReviewID": "UR17248534", "Content": "This is the best Disney Moderate Resort.

Our room was in Building 4, on the top storey, and was immaculate. It was cleaned thoroughly every day and fresh toiletries and flannel animals left daily too. The pool area was great and there is a seperate hot tub area. Towels were supplied free of charge and the lifeguards were very attentive. There was a great laundrette near the pool so for a few dollars you could do your laundry whilst swimming or relaxing by the pool. I even brought my cases back full of clean clothes! A real bonus to any Mum. The shop sold plenty of Disney items but also all essentials - medications, sun cream, basic foods, etc. Again the staff in there were really friendly and helpful. The food hall was good too. The menu was not enormous but enough choice for snacks and to have the odd meal there. The kids loved the Mickey waffles for breakfast. We purchased the Disney thermal cups on our first day - $12.95 each and you can refill them for your whole stay for free. Really worth it - you will save a fortune. We didn't use the bus service as we had a hire car but they seemed to be very regular from what we saw. We did travel by boat in the evenings to Downtown Disney and this was a great way to travel and relax - free too! To sum up - we loved the French Quarter and had no complaints whatsoever - not even tiny ones. From Mousekeeping to Lobby staff they were all very friendly and helpful.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The grounds are also very beautiful. However, there is a lot of walking involved. My daugher, who turned 5 while we were there, loved the pool. In our opinion the pool here was nicer than at the Riverside. As for the rest of the resort....the floor in our room in the bathroom and in front of the sinks was dirty. My youngest who is still crawling always had to have her feet and knees wiped off because they were always black which either was from the tile at the sinks/bathroom or the carpet was just that dirty! The tub also was dirty. When my 5 year old got in to take a bath on the first night she said Mom, we need to call the people that clean the tubs because look at the black on the bottom of the tub. (Out of the mouths of babes! However she was right so we cleaned it up.) Probably one of the most disappointments was the Food Court. The food at breakfast was okay but the rest of the day it was terrible. We even tried several different food options. Also, don't go here if you are in a hurry. This has got to have the SLOWEST staff I have ever seen! Even when there was a long line (which there was most of the time) they did not move any faster...NOTHING got them moving. They would literally make one order at a time...even in the morning when several people ordered pancakes they would only put enough pancakes for one order on at a time! This was so frustrating especially when you have kids who are hungry and ready to eat!!! Another couple we were with ate at the food court at Riverside and they said it was much better so this is an option. We did also eat at the Boatwrights for breakfast two mornings, they have awesome sweet potato pancakes and we loved the other things we got to. So, if you can do the walk up to Riverside (about 15 minutes) then it is worth it for better food. Ahhh...the buses...yet another problem for us. One morning we went out to the bus pickup to go to Downtown Disney...we waited 25 minutes and no bus ever came. We gave up at this point and went back to the room. Also, some of the buses also stop at Riverside which has 4 stops so it takes some time. At all of the parks except Magic Kingdom (Riverside and French Qtr have separate bus pick ups at MK) the lines to get the bus was long for this resort. Again another frustrating thing about this resort especially when you have young children who are tired, impatient, hungry, etc. We will never return to this resort again. My suggestion would be if you can afford it to go to the Beach Club.

We are a family of 4 with 2 kids, girls, ages 7 and 11. This was our first time to WDW so I was a bit nervous about picking the right hotel and familiarizing myself with all that Disney had to offer. I had read ALL the reviews I could find on this particular hotel so I knew what to expect-both good and bad(only from reading prior reviews). I had read the hotel was dingey.....NOT TRUE!!! This hotel is quite lovely with the beautiful plants and decor outside to the 1800's themed rooms inside. Magical Express bus dropped us off at the hotel and the front desk explained everything in detail...even with others waiting behind us. Our room was in Building 5 and was perfect!!!! It was the best building to have since it was across from the pool and a very short walk to the food court, general store and busses. I was pleased to have the room on the backside of Bldg. 5 so as not to hear pool goers late at night. The room was very quiet. The only noise I did hear was maybe tourists coming home late from the parks out on the balcony(short time only) and the flush of the power jet toilets on occasion. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows fluffy and supportive. I had read there was little storage area in the room si I was prepared with my toiletries. When I arrived, I did find there is a nice mantle over the two sink area so there was PLENTY of room to sit your make-up, sprays and other items. The dresser was an ample size that held my family of four's clothing. We kept alot in our suitcases and pulled things out tha we were planning on wearing. As everyone knows, a person packs way to much that they don't wear! The room flooring from the carpet to the tiled vanity and bath areas were very clean. there were NO strange odorsin the room and I am quite sensitive to odors. We had plenty of soap and towels each and every day.The hotel staff would arrange my daugher's stuffed animals in different positions and when we returned from the parks, the girls would laugh. We didn't get any orgami animal towel cratures as others have mentioned, but I don't think my children minded. Also, the beds were very comfortable. I have an achey back and these beds were quite comfortable. The food court was beter than expected. We opted to pay as we go insteadof the Food Plan. I didn't want to be bound with reservations at a particular restaurant since one never knows how they will feel that day or if they are in the mood for a big meal etc. I am so glad we did it this way. We frequently ate at the hotel since as it gets hot in the parks afternooon, we'd return for a lunch at the hotel. An entree with 2 sides cost us approx. $8.50 with tax. This was a very good sized meal. Using the dining plan for this I would think would rip off one's dollars. The dining plan costs about $124.00 for a family of 4. We did not ever spend that on food even with ice-cream and buying pop and water in the parks. I did not want to feel trapped at having to take a bus far from where we were only to get to that preplanned reservation....too much stress for me. I DO NOT rcommend the Ding Plan. The hotel has a smaller scale General Store where you can find everything you might need. There was beer, disny items and tanning items and a whole lot more. I bought a \"necklace\" style holder for the park cards which ws very convenient. I put the family's cards in the plastic sealed case conected to the necklace and could easily whip the cards out at the parks for entrance admission and getting Fast Passes. The pool was fantastic. My kids, ages 7 and 11, loved the pool and slide. The dragon slide was a special bonus. I partcularly booked a moderate resort due to the fact the value resors do not offer a slide. I figured since the kids love swimming and we would be doing that in our off-time, it was worthe the extra $400.00 price difference from value to moderate resort pricing. The life guards were attentive,too. We did visit the Port Orleans Riverside for a day to swim at their pool and the kids thought this pool wasn't as bright and fun...they thought it was \"boring.\" It did look older and in need of an update. While there, I noticed how widely spaced the buildings were at Riverside and was SO happy we weren't there considering the obvious long walks they had to get to everything at that resort. I thanked myself again, that I had booked at the French Quarter with everything close and the property so much smaller. We took the river taxi to downtown disney from the French Quarter and loved the beautiful and picturesque ride, especially at night. The taxi gives an added change to riding busses all day. I loved this amenity from our hotel. The buses came every 10 minutes while we were there for pick-ups, much better timing than I had read or expected. We did get first seatingon busses before Riverside pick-ups and first to get off at night...another bonus insteadof having to stop at all those stops at the Riverside. This hotel is smaller than the other hotels at Disney property and the most relaxing. Who wants to walk to everything at your hotel when your feet are about to fall off after the parks? Oh yes, the hot tub was wonderful to soak in for my tired feet! The staff were always cheerful and helpful. I did not see any rudeness. We did check out the \"upper\" echelon hotels by visiting the Polynesion, Contemporary, Boardwalk and flamingo. While the grounds are more lush and attractive, the inside offers a bigger space with more shops and walking. If one needs this, that is fine. We were happy with our litte store, pretty grounds, and smaller scale property all at a price of $1500.00 less! Don't worry, book this hotel. Ignore the negative comments on previous blogs. I don't know where and what these people expect, but this was very good for me! I am the type that enjoys the finer things and yet do not want to pay for them so this was definitely plenty for me.

The gardens around the buildings were beautiful and the added plus of the wildlife was wonderful. I saw many anole lizards around the pool, flashing their red throats at me as I sunbathed. I had a jack rabbit run over my feet, on the way to see our room when we first arrived, there are many rabbits running between the small gardens. I also saw many frogs (golden coloured), this was all an added bonus for me as i love animal and was studying animal science at the time. Although i never went on the horse-driven carts, i was allowed to pet the horses (but you must always ask before). I found the pool could get very busy in the afternoons, so I had taken up swimming in the early morning, as the sun was rising; I was always the first person in the pool. I never went on the slide in the pool due to it being a children's slide and was very small, also it isn't open until the lifeguards turn up at the pool around 10am. Transport to the parks was excellent, my mother had a wheelchair for the holiday due to medical conditions and the driver was always friendly and talkative (typical for Disney), this also gave us an added bonus of getting on the buses first and always getting a seat (brilliant). There were no buses to other hotels though, which was often a problem if we had a restaurant reservation to get to, so if we were running late we had to get a taxi. The neighbouring resort, Riverside, used the same buses and our stop was before their stops and gave us chances to get seats before them and on the return journey we were let off first, which meant we didn't have to go around the numerous Riverside stops. There was a boat service to Downtown Disney and Riverside, which was a great change from the air conditioned buses. The only problem was that it would stop running when it rained (when it rains, IT RAINS HARD!), if you were in Riverside this meant you either had to walk back or wait for the mini bus service to come pick you up (one time we had to wait well over an hour, not impressed!). The maids were very friendly and would leave us aa new towel animal everyday (i kept them all), the room was always spotless. I learnt from previous experiences in hotel, that if you leave a couple dollars a day for them, then they will bend over backwards for you! I must stress that you leave ANY and ALL valuables in the safe in room, I left my white gold earrings on the chest of draws next to the television, when we went off to typhoon lagoon, when I returned, I found my earrings missing from the box. I called the lobby straight away and the manager of security came up 5 minutes later. The manager said that I would be refunded the \u00a3100 that the earrings cost (i only bought them a day before going to Florida), I bought new earrings when I returned home. I know what exact maid had taken them and told the manager her name, I was asked if I wanted the police to be involved, I turned this down because I'd been given money for the earrings and I just wanted to relax and have fun on holiday. I was extremely pleased with the service that was offered me, as they didn\u2019t have to give me anything as I had no evidence that I had these earrings. The food court was brilliant, with such a range of food all day long, my family had the dining plan (very worth getting), so we always used our snack points to get our breakfast (cereal packs, milk, doughnuts, one of these would be a single snack point), as we didn\u2019t want a large meal for breakfast, but we got breakfast there on the last day and it was so lovely, with Mickey shaped pancakes or waffles, with any type of syrup on the planet, or sausage, egg, bacon and biscuits (my favourite). On our first evening we were very tired from travelling so we ate there, I had a rib platter, it was the best ribs I\u2019d ever had in my life, the meat just fell off (yum), this came with mash and gravy (also lovely). During lunch time they had sub sandwiches, burgers/chicken and fries (average Disney food), pizzas or spaghetti Bolognese with garlic bread, also a desert counter, with ice-cream, cakes and these pastries in balls covered in icing sugar (very nice).

The worst thing about this hotel is the food court. It is convenient for breakfast, but the cooked food is very institutional and just not good. We ate yogurt and large containers of fresh fruit for breakfast, although my son liked the kid-sized mickey waffles. I was so excited to try the beignets and they were terrible. Tough, greasy and chewy fried dough covered in sugar. We ate all other meals in the parks or at the better Disney hotels. Bus transportation was surprisingly good. We never picked up or dropped off at Riverside and went straight to and from each park. Always plenty of seats and never waited more than 5 or 6 minutes for a bus. Boat transportation to Downtown Disney was fun and relaxing in the evening. All in all it was a good stay.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westerly,RI", "Title": "\u201cOne of Disney's best moderates\u201d", "Author": "PetefromRI", "ReviewID": "UR16369135", "Content": "We just got back from the POFQ on the 23rd of May and we're really happy with this resort.We have been to quite a few Disney resorts and this is one of our new favorites.The service was good and the size of the resort being alot smaller than other Disney resorts made this trip very relaxing.We always liked the bigger resorts but as we're getting older we enjoy the shorter walks to get about.I've read some negative things as of late about the cleanliness of the rooms so we were alittle concerned about going here but luckily it was all for nothing.We found our rooms to be as nice as any Disney resort and for people who think that the rooms need updating,the theme is late 1800's New Orleans,it's supposed to look old but believe me the bedding to the drapes were beautiful and they looked relatively new.The food court was very good,it's a food court,not a steak house,so excpect what you would from a food court.The pool area was really well done and the hot tub was away from the pool so there didn't seem to be tons of kids jumping in it.The grounds are beautiful and the boat ride to Down Town Disney was an added perk.The bus service was excellent going to and comming from the theme parks.We will be back without a doubt.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "clynnog fawr", "Title": "\u201cvery enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "stanlow31", "ReviewID": "UR16268661", "Content": "We travelled out to Florida from Manchester on the 1st of May on XL airways flight 1132, our flight was delayed 6 hours in Manchester and our plane was replaced with an Iberworld a330.

We stayed for 6 nights at Disney's Port Orleans French Quarter. We chose to stay at this resort because we had already stayed at all of the other moderate resorts at least once, and had also stayed at Pop Century and All Star Sports. We wanted to try something new. The best way to summarize our stay is to say that I have to give it a mixed review. I'll begin with the positive aspects of our stay: The grounds of the resort are beautiful and scenic. The pool was very nice, and the lifeguards were very professional and attentive. My daughter (age 4) loved the water slide. My 8 year old son loved the pool, but thought that the slide was \"for babies\". The atmosphere of the resort is very peaceful. It never felt crowded. It was a nice break after a busy day at the parks to return to the resort. We were lucky to have a room in building 4, which is close to both the bus stop and the food court. Our room was very well sound proofed. We never heard a sound from our neighbors. On the negitive side, our hotel room was very much in need of updating. The bathroom, especially looked very worn. There was mildew around the soap holder. The air circulation in the bathroom was so poor that none of our bathing suits or towels would dry in there, even with the exhaust fan on. During past stays at WDW reosrt, we often returned to our room to find our children's stuffed animals peering out the window at us, and our towels made into animals. Housekeeping during this visit did the minimal amount of cleaning, but nothing more. I know that this sounds like knit picking, but our children really got a kickout of these things. The dresser in our room was looking very worn, and whenever we closed one drawer, another would pop open, all the way. This was annoying because the room was not that large, and we were always stepping around an open drawer. The food court and gift shop were smaller than those at the other moderat resorts where we have stayed. The staff was not overly friendly, especially the staff at the food court. We had purchased the dining plan for the first time this year, and at fist we were a bit confused as to which foods were on the plan. The staff appeared to be annoyed when we asked multiple questions. Summary: Port Orleans French Quarter has both good and bad characteristics. I probably would not stay there again, because in my opinion, both Port Orleans Riverside and Caribbean Beach (also WDW moderate resorts) both have a more fun and upbeat atmosphere.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, NY", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Moderate\u201d", "Author": "Jovigirl87", "ReviewID": "UR16072976", "Content": "Our stay at the Port Orleans -French Quater was really nice. It was our first real family vacation. Our party consisted of myself, my husband and our two children ages 8 and 12. We were there 04/16-04/23 for our childrens first trip to Walt Disney World. Check in was ok. I thought that the lady that checked us in rushed through everything and we were first timers and needed the extra time to understand things. The rooms were clean and well kept. My kids thought that the towel animals were made special just for them and looked forward to seeing what was left for them at the end of every day. The rooms could use a little updating but overall nice and in keeping with the New Orleans theme. My husband and I are not small people and wished the bed was a little bigger but we sucked it up. The food court was really great and we didn't find it as overpriced as I had thought it would be but to be honest we did have the meal plan. It had something for everyone. I really had a hard time understanding the meal plan (as did others as I found out talking with them while standing in line). I thought most of the staff there was pretty good explaining it. The pool area was always well maintained and beautiful. The lifeguards were very watchful. I couldn't keep my 8 year old off the slide!! And the hot tub was a welcome relief for sore feet. The bus system was ok (it beats driving yourself). It needs some work though. I understand with gas being what it is but we waited after the show at Epcot for 7 buses to come and go before we could start heading back to our hotel. Other than that we waited approx. 20-30 minutes for the bus for any of the parks. If we had it to do over again we would probably request to be closer to the pool/lobby. We were far back in #7. After a long day of walking this was painful. We really had a great time and our children will have the memories for the rest of their lives.

When we arrived our son had contracted the symptoms of a minor stomach virus. The room maid (Lilia...she was great... bldg. 4) left us extra bed linens just in case of an accident throughout the night. We were the first picked up and in most cases were the first dropped off for our trips to the parks. The only complaint I have is a small one. The breakfast eggs on the breakfast sandwiches were not real. HAHA I know.......but I dont like fake eggs. All other food we ordered in the food court area was cooked to order. It was fresh and hot. I suggest buying the refillable cups for $12 and change if you are staying for awhile. It will save you a little money. They are good at anytime through out your stay inside the resort breakfast to dinner...all beverages except alcoholic. The pool was clean and refreshing. Our son loved he kiddie slide once he was brave enough to do it. The pool side bar was wonderful for the occasional adult beverage. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful.

Rooms. We had one of the best rooms on the resort. It was a corner room overlooking the river and part of the pool area, very convenient for pool / food court and other hotel facilities. Room was adequate for family of 4. Beds were very comfortable. The bathroom consists of a bath, shower and toilet then there is a bathroom area to the back of the room that separates the bedroom area with a curtain that pulls all the way across. It consists of 2 sinks, an hairdryer, an iron board and iron and a little safe. Room was a little dusty though but a minor complaint it didnt bother us.

IMO The hotel is probably one of the best Disney properties to stay in for location. It is very convenient to DTD and all the parks are 5-10 mins away. The hotel is very easily close to the Highways and I Drive to get to the premium outlets or Walmart if you fancy escaping from the parks for a bit and doing a bit of shopping. There is also a Golden Coral close by that do big value for money buffets which include carveries and vegetables instead of the fast food. We ate in their a few times and the kids loved it. Healthy food for a change!!! The pool area is one of the best features about the hotel. It is brilliant our kids loved the dragon slide and considering we went at a busy time it was never crowded with people. Towels are provided and they also provide lifejackets for smaller children.

The longest we waited for a bus was 30 minutes after just missing one, and there seemed to be much fewer Port Orleans buses to take us back to the resort in the evening than there were for the other resorts, but maybe we were just being paranoid because we were so tired. Also, there wasn't much routine in that sometiomes they would call at the Riverside section on the way to the parks, sometimes not, and in the evening sometimes we'd get dropped off first, other times the Riverside people were.

While there were folks at check-in and when calling the front desk that were willing to go out of their way, our experiences with housekeeping, food service, and the gift shop left a lot to be desired. They tended to be unfriendly and I felt as if I was inconvienencing them with the simplest of questions (for example, \"what's the total for my meal?\" The grounds were beautiful and well cared for. Bus service was much quicker at this resort than the Riverside, likely due to the smaller size of the park. The restaurant is OK for breakfast and snacks, but we often walked to Riverside or opted to eat in the parks or at other resorts. Our room was passable in terms of cleanliness at best. We left a note for housekeeping that the sheets had holes in them and our comforter left evidence of past guests (I'll leave out the ugly details of that), and nothing was done about it. While you'll find some of these situations in other hotels, Disney tends to pride itself on excellent customer experiences, and based on our stay, I'd say that that quality has diminished significantly in past years.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayne, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLoved the French Quarter!\u201d", "Author": "h0neym00ner3", "ReviewID": "UR14967814", "Content": "We just got back from a 5 day stay at Disney's French Quarter and loved it!

To summarise:- The rooms are a decent size, and clean. The bathroom is pretty small but has a good shower. Maid service is very good and no problems there. One day we stayed in our room as our daughter was a little unwell, we put our sign outside the room for no housekeeping, and we had a message on our phone to confirm they wouldnt disturb us but we were to call if we needed anything. Fridge in the room was handy, and ironing board, iron & safe provided free. Please bear in mind this is a 3 star hotel, 3 and a half at best, so you get what you pay for - it is past basic but not luxurious - howerver it is a lot cheaper than most disney resorts, and if you want to be close to all of the parks then its a great choice. We like the security of being on disney property and not to have to drive much on holiday so it was excellent - in fact you probably dont need a hire car to stay there. Food - you can only order pizza for room service, but with it you could order 2L bottles of coke, water or sprite which was a handy way of getting water into the fridge without carrying it! Food in the food court was very good but limited choice. We ate quite often at the Riverside which is a 10 min stroll or 5 minutes on the excellent water taxi which also want to downtown Disney which has various restaurants - we actually enjoyed the trip to Riverside on the water taxi as the captains were a good laugh. At Riverside the food court is a bit bigger as it is double the size resort, they have a nice salad bar and more choice. You can purchase a souvenir mug for $12 which gives you free hot & cold drinks for your entire stay, great value. We picked the French resort as it is much smaller than Riverside and were glad of our choice. about 90% of the buses picked up from our resort and went straight to the parks, whereas riverside had 4 bus stops so journey times were about 10 mins longer. Any buses returning to the hotel stopped at French first so this was great when you were tired from a day at the park. If you are leaving a park when it closes and are not tight I would suggest howerver jumping in a taxi for about $10 you will be home in 5 mins instead of queuing for 20 mins for a bus then taking 15 mins to get home - not for everyone though but we liked our bed! The pool is excellent with a nice slide which would suit kids probably 3 - 9 years. The lifeguards were excellent, always at least 2 on and constantly walking round the pool checking all areas, unlike some who seem to be dozing behind their sunglasses! There is a nice hot tub which is open to children too provided they are with their parents, which we liked. A good sized games arcade but no fitness centre or any characters (bar easter sunday when Donald & Daisy turned up) at the hotel so you might want to book a character meal - we enjoyed the disney princess meal at epcot. Staff were all friendly, not at reception bar check in which was smooth, your check out bill was on your door the morning of departure so you dont need to check out at reception unless you are disputing your bill.

These three restaurants alone paid for our 5 days worth of meal plan. Snacks - roasted almonds are the best deal for your snack plan. French Quarter and Harbour House are also great places to go for quick meals. Riverside was VERY busy!! We still found a table, but it was crazy.

The hotel gardens and public areas are up to the usual Disney standard. I booked this as I wanted a moderate-priced Disney hotel and it looked good. It's not as animated as others and has a quaint feel to it. Our rooms were adjoining rooms located on the corner of the building (4 I think) right next to the on-site restaurant which I thought might be busy or noisy but it was a great location. It was less than a minute to the pool and about two minutes to the bus stop. No problem getting a bus. Bit busy if you go to fireworks at Epcot when park is closing. The rooms had two queen size beds, 2 sinks, bathroom, tv and table and two chairs. There is not much hanging space for clothes though. The cleaning was ok - did think they could have been more fussy with the hoover though - but I am being fussy - the bathrooms and beds were spotless. There is a shop on site with a fair selection of gifts and also crisps, biscuits, toiletries etc. If you shop at Disney, just give them your room number and they will deliver it to the French Quarter shop for you to pick up later. On the way to the pool from the main building there is a laundry room located beside the hot tub. There is also a games room with arcade games, air hockey etc and an outdoor slide. Our girls (11 and 6) loved the pool and the slide - you can see the Sassagoula river and the boat for Downtown Disney from the pool. I thought of booking a pool view room in order to keep an eye on the kids but there is a fence and bushes almost entirely around the pool area so I'm glad I didn't. French Quarter is much smaller than the Riverside resort. Some rooms look miles from the Riverside public areas. The pool is better at the French Quarter. It looks the same size as the Riverside (if not bigger) and has much fewer guests - although you can use both hotel's facilities. There are more dining options at Riverside but that didn't bother us. Most nights we got a taxi to the Golden Corral for an all-you-can-eat buffet. It's about 5-10 min in a taxi but the prices are so reasonable it works out much cheaper. The Mickey waffles on site are great for kids and the pancakes cooked to order. We had them most mornings. Fruit and cereal are also in plentiful supply. The parks were very busy when we were there - most other tourists were American - I was told this was the time of year most Americans visit Disneyland whether that's true I don't know.

My overall experience during Easter week 3/17 \u2013 3/25 was great. We were on the first floor building 5 that had a courtyard view. A short distance to parking but still a good walk. - Room: Average size for a Disney moderate. We were in a room with two full size beds for a family of four. Another review mentioned Queen size but I only noticed rooms with either two full or 1 king. Solid walls. Never heard neighbors nor outside noises. Clean with no surprises. Limited storage space though. My car rental had more storage space. The room only contained one main dresser with six storage drawers. A small refrigerator, 2 cup coffee maker, average size TV with limited channel selection. Other than several Disney channels. There is no HBO or other premium cable networks. One word of caution. We requested and received bed rails for our four year old. The beds are set high off the ground. The rails were limited in a sense that they could not hold their grip to the bed. Thus on multiple occasions, our son was able to push the rail away from the bed while a sleep and fall through. An f/y/i was submitted to management to review these rails for safety. No injury occurred. A curtain divided the back end of the room near the bathroom for privacy space. Within this area there was an open rack for hanging clothing, a seat bench and two pedestals sinks. There was no draw space for bathroom materials or other items like used clothing or purchases. You have to utilize shelf space that was above the sinks. Bathroom is standard size with toilet and full bath. We noticed mold on our shower curtain upon arrival as well as our coffee maker was not functioning. Simple call to House Services remediate both problems instantly. The environmentally friendly \u201cgreen\u201d toilet made a memorable sound every time it was used. - Grounds: Major plus. Overall fantastic looking grounds. Always in very clean condition. Large pool with very kid friendly, (and sometime adult friendly) slide. Very quiet grounds compared to other resorts. - Dining: We only used the single restaurant on the property for counter service breakfast. For eight days the choices never really changed. There were several selections of eggs and pancakes, French toast as well as pastries and other selection cereals. The quality was average at best for breakfast. A short distance (15 minute walk) upstream at the sister resort Riverside, there are additional selections for meal services. - Transportation: Unlike other reviews, we thought having the transportation was a major perk. For the record, we did not return from the parks after normal closing hours. We utilized the magic hours afterwards and returned much later. Waits to go anywhere out of the resort took less than 10 minutes. Return waits were a little bit longer but we always got on the first bus that came for our resort. Rides to and from the resort was about 15 minutes. We had direct service to and from the resort to the parks with no other stops. There was also ferry service that took you on a relaxing 15 minute ride downstream to Downtown Disney Marketplace. Again, when we utilized the service, it was never over taxed even during the busy Easter week. The service appears to have been running on a every 15 to 20 minute basis. Again, very enjoyable. Overall my experience with this Disney Resort was excellent. If they could only add the much needed additional storage space as well as maybe create better sleeping options, (optional Queen / Full combos), would make the French Quarter and 10 rating must stay.

We were there March 15-20, 2008. We were in a water view room with a view of the river, and we were close to the pool. The resort was nice, clean and the grounds well kept. The room was average size with 2 queen size beds. The beds were comfortable. Housekeeping did an excellent job. I had read reviews about dirty rooms, mold in the tub, etc, and NONE of this was the case with our visit. Our room was very clean, and the tub was VERY clean! We had 2 towel animals in our room upon arrival. Housekeeping did a great job keeping our little girls fascinated with how they arranged their stuffed animals each day when they cleaned our rooms. One day my daughters stuffed monkey was hanging from the ceiling fan when we arrived back from a day at the parks, and she thought that was hillarious!!!! The only complaint I have (and would be the only reason that keeps me from ever staying here again), is the bus service. It may have been because this was such an incredibly busy week in Disney, but the bus service to French Quarter was horrible. Every night that we would get ready to leave the parks (exhausted), we would wait 20 minutes or more on a bus. All the other resort bus waiting areas were never as cram-packed as Port Orleans was. There would be 2 buses to arrive at every other resort's stop in the time one bus would arrive to Port Orleans. When we stayed at Carribean Beach Resort last year we NEVER had this problem. We waited longer for a bus at French Quarter (a smaller resort) than we did at one of the largest resorts on Disney property (Carribbean Beach Resort)!!!!!! My theory is that since French Quarter is a smaller resort, maybe they have less buses servicing this resort. Who knows! We usually stood on the bus on the way home also. At least leaving from the resort, we did get a seat on the way to the parks since French Quarter is picked up before Riverside. The only other tip I have is NOT to get a river view room. We payed extra for a river view room, and wished we had not. The problem is that the river view rooms are the rooms furtherest away on the property. We drove to Disney, and therefore, we unloaded our luggage and brought it to our room ourselves. The parking lot is a long distance from a river view room!!! It seemed like we hiked forever with our luggage to get to our room. We would have much rather had a garden or parking lot view because we would not have had such a walk from the car. It was really bad the day we checked out because it was raining, and we had to walk IN THE RAIN with all our luggage all the way to the parking lot. Overall, we had a pleasant experience at French Quarter. The kids LOVED the pool with the serpant slide. The food court was never that crowded.

Check in: Arrived two hours early to a line-free registration and my room was ready. It's not a huge resort - but large enough where probably staying closer to the main building is a good bet. I stayed in Bldg. 4 - convenient, with a view of the internal courtyard which was lovely. Maybe it was a quiet weekend, but some buildings, by nature of the direction they faced, seemed a little too quiet. I liked being close to the lobby and bus service. Room: I loved the way these are decorated! Perhaps a tight squeeze for 4 - but more than fine for 2. Very cute - a large area where a curtain can be used to separate the bed area from the two sinks - and then a VERY small room for shower and toilet (too small maybe). Being moderate - you notice the sheets are not lux, towels are thin and room amenities are sparse. But it was clean and the decor really is cool, very ornate yet tasteful. Fun. Grounds: Very nice - wrought iron, charming. Fun pool - although the bigger pool is at the Riverside and there were more dining options there - I felt from my brief walkthrough that the FQ is just nicer in my humble opinion. I should note that the kids and adults I saw were always having a blast in the FQ pool - they have a very cool slide. The boat ride from the hotel to Downtown Disney was picturesque and fun - as mentioned in previous posts - the 'Capatains' on the boats are terrific - kind and funny. Always waving to people they pass - great touch! Bus service was consistent and it was nice to be picked up before Riverside, which has several bus stops compared to FQ's one - practically guaranteed you a seat. Amenities: The only room service is pizza, which I didn't have but it seemed popular. No fancy restaurant on site - just one large fast food place (but large and nicely themed) where you could get a sandwich, junk food, pizza, fruit - a beer, etc. A more upscale food option would have been appreciated. One night I came back after a full day at the Parks and 'Scat Cats' - the bar off the lobby (opens at 4pm I believe) - had a fantastic singer, and the bar patrons were having an absolute blast - I was very sorry I was too tired to go in and enjoy it. Summary: You pay more for the 'luxury' resorts - where you get full service and more options - the best of the best with a lot of little extras. Where at the FQ the elevator was a little run down looking, the hotel had cheapish sheets (not bad, just thin), and no conditioner for your hair (not a big deal, just the stupid little things you notice) - and all around less to offer. BUT, of course the deal is - this resort costs considerably less than those that do give you those extras and is a fine choice - clean and very nice. I wasn't there with children but the one's I saw were well occupied and having a blast (there is a little arcade on site too). For adults with no kids it may not be the perfect choice - but I enjoyed it anyway - the rates, the pretty grounds and kind employees (they really were great). I would recommend this hotel - it's not what you'd get at the Grand Floridian, but for half the price - it is well laid out with lovely rooms and you'll get the Disney experience which is what it's all about.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pilar", "Title": "\u201cVery good overall choice for WDW\u201d", "Author": "Gabeto", "ReviewID": "UR14144166", "Content": "Port Orleans FQ seems like an excellent choice for a moderately priced resort in the WDW area.

I was a little leary because of reviews I read about the resort, but it was for nothing because the resort was great. \"Mousekeeping\" was fine for us and our room was cleaned every day. No, our sheets were not changed every day, but I didn't expect them to be. Our housekeeper even straightened out our shoes every day for us! We enjoyed the colourful restaurant and theh food was good. The ferry ride to Riverside was a nice change as well. The grounds were beautifully kept and there were even bunny rabbits hopping around.

It's kind of a hard place to review, since it has things that are good, bad, and neutral about it. In actuality, I would probably rate it a 3.5. Good: On the outside, the grounds are beautiful. Right on the river, with lots of walking paths, beautiful greenery, and a very quiet, pleasant atmosphere. The buildings are painted in different colors, with lots of wrought iron railings. All the corridors are exterior, with a combination of stairways and elevators. Also, plenty of convenient parking if you have a car. All the grounds are spotless. There are small riverboats running almost constantly between this resort and the Riverside next door (about 7 minutes by boat), as well as to Downtown Disney (about 15 minutes by boat). The boats are free, and besides being conveninet transportation they are a wonderful way to just relax on the river. We took one down to Downtown Disney a couple of times, just to wander around and have an ice cream. The room we had (1331), was clean and comfortable. Two double beds, with good firm mattresses. There are two pedistal sinks with a convenient shelf above it for toiletries, and plenty of space for clothes and suitcases. There is a ceiling fan that kept the room comfortable (February - in the 70s), as well as a wall air conditioner that worked fine and wasn't overly noisy. Despite the exterior corridors, the room was quiet. Neutral: Part of the review on the room also falls into the neutral category. There was a fairly old TV with limited channels (five of which were Disney promo), and the furniture has an older, slightly worn look to it. Two of the dresser drawers would not stay closed if you put too much in them. The clock worked, but the alarm and radio didn't. The towels were plentiful and clean, but thin and somewhat worn out. Tub/shower was clean, but lots of caulking in the corners. Not much in the way of amenities in the room, other than the usual soap and shampoo. There are shuttle buses running about every 15 - 20 minutes, which are great for getting to the park and saving on the expensive parking. However, they only service Disney - not attractions like SeaWorld or Discovery Cove. I honestly think they should offer that service, even for a small fee. The food service is okay, but certainly not great. The selection was limited, and tends to fall into the fast food or cheap coffee shop genre. It's self-service, with plastic trays, paper plates, plastic silverware, etc. There is no room service except for pizza delivery, which was expensive but actually pretty good. Prices were fairly reasonable for anything connected to Disney, where everything seems to be priced between the merely exorbitant and the utterly ridiculous. You'll get sick of eating there in a real hurry, and there is no other alternative on the property. You can walk or ride to the adjacent Riverside, which shares facilities with the French Quarter. They have an expanded self-serve restaurant as well as a table-service restaurant. We were unable to eat at the table-service place because reservations were required and they were already full - remember this is February - but their menu items looked good and their prices were high. There are lots of other restaurants in the immediate area, but you need a car to get there. Bad: Surprisingly for a Disney resort, the worst part of the stay were the people who work there. With the exception of the man who helped us when we checked in, virtually everyone we came into contact with was either disinterested and bored or downright rude. Many had only limited English skills, and some were very difficult to understand. We were going to take a drive one day (got to escape the mouse at some point!), and asked a woman at a desk in the lobby for some basic information. She informed us in broken English that she was only there to sell Disney time-shares, and we should ask at the concierge desk. We stood in line for 15 minutes (again, remember this is February - can't imagine what summer is like), and when we asked for some simple driving instructions and suggestions for local things to see, the woman told us that was \"personal information\", and that she could only help us with Disney-related matters. Instead of \"Concierge\" over the counter, it should say \"Disney Hussle-You Sales\". Conclusion: All in all, a good place to stay, depending on what you're looking for. If you want a convenient, quiet place to stay while hitting all the theme parks, this is a great choice. If you want some choices in food and things to do other than Disney, you might look elsewhere.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "rhode island", "Title": "\u201cokay, but could improve\u201d", "Author": "dcmsox2004", "ReviewID": "UR13792808", "Content": "we arrived on 2/16, and without a doubt, having aaa book our hotel was a bonus. with aaa, we had the magical express deliver our baggage directly to our room, and after a 15000 mile flight, and all that goes with travel, was a great option.

The only complaint I had was that the pool was closed! It was a little cool to go swimming while we were there, but my complaint hedges on the fact that Disney did not communicate to us at any point in time that the pool would be closed for renovations during our stay.

The rooms were a little smaller than Carribean Beach, where we stayed in May, but we really didn't miss it and prefer this resort hands down. The boat to Downtown Disney was a nice way to travel, with beautiful views approaching the area. Maid service was good although we missed getting the towel animals we got last time at CBR. I guess it all depends on the individual cleaning the room. I would recommend that you ask for a corner room, we got one without asking but in the future will ask as they have two windows instead of one. The bus service was very good and we prefered it to CBR as we had only one bus stop for the entire resort. Some of the service was shared with Riverside but on the whole we had fewer stops.

They closed the pool area on January 28th and it will remain closed through March. There are buses that can take you to next door Riverside to use their pool. I honestly would recommend that if you are traveling during this period, you book either Port Orleans Riverside or the newer Coronado as an alternative. Without the pool area, the french quarter is a little lacking in amenities. Just my opinion. If staying in the French Quarter, it is helpful to know that the even number buildings were previously smoking (all have been non-smoking since June). Buildings 1 and 7 are furthest from the main areas and bus stops, they are also the quietest. I feel the preferred rooms are worth the extra money, for the river views.

OK amenities (as other reviews state)...awful Front Desk/Concierge help. I have been a Disney fanatic all my life. I am an Annual Passholder at the Disneyland Resort and in California since we live so close, my family has never stayed at a Disney property. But it's always been a dream of mine and on this trip, we decided to go for it and splurge. Because it was a busy weekend - the only availabilty was at the Port Orleans - French Quarter. Looking online, it looked like a good bet. There was only room available for one of our two nights and through a website wholesaler we found a room at the other property (Riverside). Luckily, after a lot of hassle we were able to stay at one place for both nights. Little did we know what we'd encounter. You would expect some cheeriness in a Disney employee, no? At the Port Orleans French Quarter - the Front Desk agent hardly spoke to me - she barely asked me: \"Name?!\" to which I gave her mine and the next and last thing she communicated to me was where our room was on the map. When I went to the car, I noticed that she only checked us in for one night. When I went back into the lobby, I asked several of the employees standing around if there was someone I could speak to since I had a screaming 1 year old in the car and did not want to stand in line for 15 minutes again. Finally after being passed around - I landed at the Concierge desk. The employee told me he'll go in back to check on something. After waiting another 10 minutes, I had to ask another employee to check on his status. The second employee came back out and said that the 1st employee told her to tell me (!!!!) that I'd have to come back in the morning. Upset that I'd probably have to stand in line again the next day, we went to our room since we were all tired after a red eye flight from California. Luckily throughout that day and the next we did encounter Disney cheeriness...in other people. At checkout, the Front Desk agent again barely spoke. This time this agent asked \"room #?\" and when I asked can I change credit cards? She didn't answer but merely gave me my receipt - I asked the question again and she said - no not possible and was already looking to the next in line. Lastly when I went to our car, I noticed that we were missing our son's security blanket. And this thing is extremely important - son can't sleep in a strange place without it. I ran back in and again got tossed around here and there and begrudgingly walked over to the concierge desk. I asked if there was anyway someone could help me contact housekeeping to find if they have it. They told me to go back to the floor and ask the housekeepers there. I asked for a specific name, the Concierge employees said - no there are a couple - you'd have to ask each one - good luck! I am so disappointed that this was my first Disney stay - I would not recommend this property. Check the Riverside out first and anywhere else. I'm just glad my son isn't old enough to really be disappointed too.", "Date": "January 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful stay in the World of Disney!\u201d", "Author": "lilacbirman", "ReviewID": "UR12587361", "Content": "We picked this hotel because it's the smallest of all the resorts on Disney property and it worked out great for our family of three. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient, our room was kept clean but the restaurant service could have used improvement. We initially got a lovely river view room but found that it was a smoking room so we changed it immediately and received a pool and partial river view room on the second floor. The room had two full size beds which I found a bit small for two adults but our 9 year old son had a whole bed to himself and loved it! This resort has a New Orleans theme and we loved the charm of it. There is only a casual walk up counter service restaurant which was sufficient for our early breakfast needs. We were also able to take a 10 minute stroll to it's sister resort Port Orleans Riverside for a sit down breakfast. There is also a bar/lounge which features jazz music but we did not go there during this trip. There is a smallish game room for the kids and a very nice gift shop near the lobby which sells items that you would see in New Orleans as well as the usual Disney souvenirs. The busses are efficient and the nice thing was that although the two PO resorts share busses, French Quarter guests get picked up and dropped off first! One of the best features is the boat ride to Downtown Disney! It's very a calm 15 minute ride which passes some other resorts on the Sassagoula River. The resort also has a really cool pool with a sea-serpent slide which our son enjoyed. We only used the pool once and had no problems getting lounge chairs just after lunch. The laundry room has lots of washers and dryers (maybe 15 of each) and was not crowded during the mid-day hour I did our laundry. It takes two cycles to actually get your clothes dry though. They do have a coin-operated vending machine for detergent and softener if you forget to bring your own. We noticed that most of the rooms are very close to the lobby, and all the amenities so this is very convenient for those who don't want to have to walk very far. The pool was open until midnight during our stay and we could hear the noise in the evenings. Since I am a very light sleeper, we made sure to keep our room fan on which did the trick for me! I could barely hear anything outside and our room stayed at a comfortable level of coolness (we found the room got too cold with the a/c on).

I told them, no way and they came up with a third floor room in the same building as the first floor room. It was much better for noise but the furnishing left alot to be desired. Let's say, they were lovely in their \"hay day\" but in dire need of replacement. The rooms are all non smoking but the reminders of the smoking days are evident in the cigarette burns on the furniture and burns in the sheets and top blankets. Our room had two double beds. Both beds had newer matresses on them but they were of different thicknesses. The dust ruffles on the bed frame also looked like bargain store pieces. One ruffle touched the floor and the other was 4 inches from the floor. We only had one chair at the table in the room. If we wanted to watch t.v. we had to sit on the end of the bed or on the bed. Housekeeping left allot to be desired and the fridge was just cool not cold. The fridge did not have a knob to adjust the coolness. The air conditioner was very loud and we could not turn it off. One night it rattled itself into heat mode and roasted us.To do it all over again, we would stay at a hotel on the perimeter of Disney. Most offer a free shuttle service to the parks and they are a lot less money per night. Also they have less expensive eateries around them. On a plus side, the parks were great and we enjoyed them. We weren't right in the Christmas rush but still found them very congested. We also found the food prices very high in the parks.

From the moment we arrived at Disney\u2019s Port Orleans ~ French Quarter, it was everything we hoped it would be. The check-in was quick and painless and everyone was friendly and courteous. It was just my 7 year old son and I. It was his first time at Disney and my third, although it was the first time for me staying at a Disney Resort. The both of us loved the French Quarter, the lobby was very nice and so was our room with the Mardi Gras d\u00e9cor. Our room was spotless when we arrived and well maintained on a daily basis.

We never waited long for the bus and the bus rides were quicker than I thought they would be to get to the different parks, I was pleasantly surprised. When booking our trip, I purchased the dining plan so I had booked all of our dining prior to the trip, but on most nights during our stay, we would stop at the Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory Food Court once we arrived back to our resort from being at the parks all day. We would pick up a snack and bring it back to our room. Only once did we stop to have breakfast there, but in all honesty, we enjoyed everything we had to eat from the food court. They also have a cute little shop with lots of resort memorabilia and Disney souvenirs. They have pretty much anything you would need there. I could go on and on but the fact is we had a great time and truly enjoyed our stay. I would recommend it to anyone with children and my son often asks if we can stay there again on our next Disney trip. I have no doubt we will stay there again.

Not during the holidays. But, first, let me be fair. The hotel grounds are pretty, and the room is decorated in a way comparable to new orleans. But the walls were painted this sick pale blue and the wall paper border is really old and dated. But, I could over look that, whatever, it's paint. What I think everyone should know about the room is that on the wall next to the table in the room, was the dead remains of a bug that had been smashed there. After not cleaning it up for a few days, I finally took a wash rag and wiped the dead bug off the wall. And for a few days, the maids didn't even bother to wipe off the walls of the shower--they left a glob of paper or something on the wall. I didn't want to touch it. So, be warned, if you aren't tipping them every day (we usually tip on the last day of our stay), they won't take care of you. No new shampoo everyday, and apparently to save water (LOL--the environmental hyposcrisy--while running diesel buses very ineffectively) they don't change your sheets for 4 nights. Wow. And the beds are true double beds--even though there's definitely room for queens, if they would just buy narrower night stands. No one in this century sleeps in double beds anymore--almost all upscale hotels offer queen beds now in their double rooms. We had to add a roll away (another $15 a night) just to accomodate our two teenagers and us in the room. And with the rollaway, there was barely room in the room for us to walk around. It's a tiny room from the 60's or 70's and I've had more space in a Motel 6. Now let's talk about the food court at both French Quarter and Riverside. The servers are rude and the food service is slow. The prices were jacked up during the holidays ( Merry Christmas!) and the worst part of the experience, was the music track. They are playing a 'cajun' version of Christmas songs over and over and over. The worst part is it's the same 5 songs. Literally. Seriously--Disney can't afford to do better than that? And let's talk about the time of full breakfast. Get this--the Morning Magic Hours begin at 7:00 am, and the buses start running at 7:00 am (no way to get there when the park opens at 7, but I'll talk about that in the next paragraph). So, if you want to eat breakfast before you take the bus, you're out of luck because the hot breakfast doesn't start serving until --- you got it-- 7:00 am. Oh, sure you can get a bowl of cereal, or a sugar-laden muffin or danish. But if you want any protein to hold you for more than a few hours...too bad. Bus service. This is the most frustrating part of the entire 'resort' experience. You are completely dependent upon this ridiculous bus transit system. If you want to go to the park early for Magic Morning Hours, you can't even possibly get there when the park opens, because the buses don't start running until the same time the parks are opening. And so many of the buses run at erratic times. You can't plan for anything. There's no sense to it at all. Sometimes, two Animal Kingdom buses will come by to pick up when there's no one waiting, but the Epcot bus never shows up for 40 minutes. It's completely feasible that with the slow breakfast and delayed buses, you (a resort guest) could actually get into the park later than people staying off site. All for $245 a night during peak holiday season. And the best part is that when you wait and wait for a bus, you finally get on and it stops at several other stops before going to the park. And on the way, you see buses sitting around in parking lots, just waiting to be sent out by some dispatcher who's obviously not in touch with each of the stops or how many people are waiting at each stop. A couple of times we'd take walks on the grounds and there'd be lots of resort golf-cart and electric vehicles riding on the same walking paths for the pedestrians--this would be the employees. One time we were almost run down by one going so fast around a corner she barely had time to slow down before she saw us. I swore when I got home I would do whatever I could to stop people from going to Disney during the holidays. It truly was shoulder to shoulder in the park, the patrons were miserable, the kids were crying, the ride lines were sometimes 2 hours long, the fast passes would all be gone by noon for the day, the food prices were jacked up 20% during the holidays, the shows were just okay, and the rides were short, and mostly a waste of time. If I could tell anyone any piece of advice, I would tell them to get their kids out of school and take them to a 'funeral' any other week but the week after Christmas. Here's the good stuff. The hotel grounds are beautiful and we got a river view, which was nice. The best time of day was when we were back at the resort when most of the crowds were at the parks. There was a horse and carriage going around the two hotels. It was charming, but cost $35. We hung around the pool or just crashed in the room. We went over to Fort Wilderness and rode on the Sea Raycers...which was fun. If you're really hungry, go over there and eat at the buffet restaurant. It's all you can eat. It's pricey, but at least you can get your fill and maybe skip a meal later in the day at the park. Just ride the ferry over from Magic Kingdom or take any of the buses over there. All this 'magic' is created by the Disney machine that is just so money hungry they can't even figure out how to close the gates when the parks reach capacity. Or how about this idea--during the week of December 26-January 1, shut the park to anyone who's not staying on a resort property. Then you can increase your resort attendance, but keep the parks attendance down to a manageable level for those of us staying at the resorts. As it is, the Disney greed to allow outside patrons into a park that's already over filled is ruining the experience for virtually everyone.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Mountain, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "cjajsmom", "ReviewID": "UR12292823", "Content": "After 30+ years of marriage, my husband and I finally went to Walt Disney World. Since this was our first time, I consulted with a travel agent and took her advice as to where to stay. Her suggestions of Port Orleans French Quarter was absolutely 100% perfect for us. We arrived a day earlier than planned and the resort was able to provide us a room for the night and then switched us to our reserved room the next afternoon. The staff at the front desk were just wonderful every time we talked with them and everything we did with them was done quickly and correctly. Our reserved room was on the second floor, which we thought could be a problem, but the steps were easy. The room itself was very pleasantly decorated and clean (except for a little bit of dust in some obscure places). We did have to request toiletries several times during our stay. I'm not sure why we kept being overlooked on this. We did have a problem with the AC unit running extremely loudly (it literally shook the room). We requested repairs several times, but it wasn't until our fifth night when we directly contacted maintenance that a repair was made -- they got rid of one noise (a real sleep interrupter) and replaced it with another noise (which was constant, so it didn't wake us up). That was probably our worst problem while we there -- and it really wasn't a major issue. One day we forgot to lock our safe in our room (it is a small safe, we fit my husband's meds and an envelope of cash in there) and returned to the room later in the day to find that nothing had been disturbed. Someone (housekeeping, maintanance) could have taken $500.00 that day if they had wanted. The safe was obviously open, so we know that those who were in our room that day were honest people. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. We did bring our own bottom sheet as the Disney resorts do not use fitted sheets. The fan over the bed (not found in most Disney resorts) was quite a plus. We are used to sleeping with a fan, we just like the movement of air at night. We've heard complaints about the noise of the toilets from adjacent rooms. While we did notice this, it really was no different than hearing toilets at home. We did not find this to be disturbing. I particularly liked the bathtub / shower. The floor of the tub was not slippery at all -- getting in and out was very easy and safe. The shower head was one of the best I've used in a motel. Towels were amply supplied and replaced daily (even though we followed the guideliness for reusing towels in order to save energy). The restaurant on the premises was sufficient. It had a nice selection of counter-service food (from pizza to subs to salads). Breakfast was very good. The staff here were great for the most part. (As with all of WDW, we found that the people from other countries were much more courteous and friendly as a whole than the people from the states.) The pool was very well-maintained. We never saw a crowd at the pool even though the entire resort was booked. The staff at the pool were intent on their jobs and were alert. We did note that some guests seemed to feel that the pool staff's job was to clean up after them. Even though a return bin for used towels was available, they left towels all over the place. In particular, the hot tub area (frequented by adults, not children) was a mess every morning. I don't fault the POFQ staff for this, I fault the irresponsible guests. The grounds of the resort are beautiful. From the minute you pull through the gate, you feel relaxed. The plants and grasses and walkways were all maintained impeccably. I loved the way each double set of rooms had their own unique garden or \"front yard\" look. Strolling through the resort was a pleasant way to start each morning.

The bathroom was small (just a toilet and a bathtub), but we appreciated the double sinks located just outside the lavoratory and the curtain which could be drawn for privacy.

The service was slow at times, but the staff was always courteous. Our daughter enjoyed the pool, but noted that the slide was a \"bit slow.\" She's a big fan of wild rides. The hot tub was separate from the pool area. Compared to the one that we used at the Caribbean Resort during our last visit, this jacuzzi was quite large. We met a lot of friendly people in the hot tub every evening. The French Quarter does not have a sit-down restaurant, but you can either take a short walk or a boat ride to the Riverside Resort next door.

We had previously stayed at All Star Music, but wanted something a little quieter for a 3 week stay. Our flight was delayed so we didn't arrive at the hotel until around 7pm. There was only a few people checking in at that time, so we were checked in quickly and efficiently. Only slight issue was that she could have pointed us in the direction of our room, as we literally had no idea which direction to go in. The room was nice, noticebly bigger than the all star resort, with two double beds, 2 sinks outside the bathroom, all nicely themed. The bathroom was tiny but I believe that's the same at all disney resorts. The good thing about this resort is it's so compact, we were in building 6 and we were literally a 2 minute walk to the food court and buses. Food - we were on the disney dining plan, so had a few meals at the foodcourt. Breakfasts there were good with a reasonable selection, it could get very busy at peak breakfast time. We had a couple of lunches there which consisted of veggie burgers, pizzas etc which are reasonable as the burgers are cooked fresh when you order them. The bakery was popular and the Beignets are definetely worth a try. We often went to the foodcourt at Riverside as it was larger with a better selection incuding a carvery and a make your own salad station. Even if you don't go to eat there, it's worth a visit as it's a very beautiful resort (it was may be a 5-10 minute walk from our building). Resort - French quarter is a very quiet, beautiful resort. It's full of beautifully kept courtyards and gardens, and felt quite peaceful after a day in the park. The swimming pool was popular but we only used it once. The laundry facilities are plentiful for the size of the resort. The lounge is also good, with a good selection of drinks which you can take back to your room if you prefer. Buses - Disney transportation was really great from this resort. In 3 weeks I think our maximum wait was in the 10 minute region and often a bus would appear almost as soon as we got to the bus stop. I also liked the fact we were the first resort to be picked up, as it could often get busy by the time we'd been round the riverside stops. Overall I would definetely stay at this resort again. In the same trip we also spent a couple of nights at the Hard Rock Hotel, which was much more luxurious but also a lot more expensive!

This is the 2nd time that I've stayed in this on-property hotel and highly recommend it overall. The value for the money, especially when booked through Disney as part of a package is very good. This is definitely true when you consider that the price includes free use of all Disney transportation onsite (buses, monorail, water taxis, etc.) and the Disney Magical Express that shuttles you from the airport and back again (without having to deal with your luggage which arrives at your hotel room later). We requested a corner room when we booked which are slightly larger and have 2 sets of windows overlooking the grounds instead of the standard one set. This gives a very open and airy feeling to the room. I would recommend staying in Bldg 3 or 4 for close proximity to the buses, lobby and food court. Request Bldg 2 or 5 to be close to the pool. The room itself was clean and had all of the amenities you would expect in a moderate hotel including a refrigerator and wall safe. The bathroom area is nicely laid out with 2 separate pedestal sinks which is also separate from the tub/toilet area. So, this allows multiple people to get ready very easily in the morning. We had very quick check-in and the staff were always friendly, even helping us late one-night recover our lost key card (which doubles as your charge card) in a very professional and efficient manner. We only had really one snafu in that one day housekeeping failed to clean our room. We alerted the front desk and they were very thankful we had called it to their attention. The grounds are beautifully maintained and the hotel is very quiet and relaxing, especially after long days at the parks. There is a water taxi behind the pool area that takes you to Downtown Disney and you can also rent bikes onsite to travel the vast trails around this hotel and it's sister, Port Orleans-Riverside. The bus service is quick and since it arrives before going to Riverside you are always guaranteed a seat. This time of year by the way is ideal for visiting because the crowds are very manageable and the weather is ideal (past the rainy season, mild days and cool evenings). There is no onsite sit-down restaurant any longer but there is a very adequate food court which is perfectly fine for breakfast.

There was only one bathroom in the entire Main Lobby building which was in the back far corner of the eating area. A pain to get to if your not eating. The pool area also was themed poorly. Some of the \"icons\" just didn't click together to the New Orleans theme and didn't make sense. If your staying on site and looking at the moderates, you'll do better staying at one of the others.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIt's Fine...\u201d", "Author": "MemphisWinelover", "ReviewID": "UR10457963", "Content": "I've now stayed at all of the moderate priced resorts at Disney and this one is fine.

As part of the package, we booked 6 nights at the Port Orleans French Quarter hotel on Disney property. It was a great choice. Our group consisted of 15 people and we took 5 rooms. All of our rooms were together on the first floor since my father was in a motorized wheel chair. We were in Building #6 with a great view of the river. The hotel is beautiful with nice walkways. It was quiet and we never had noise issues. The one bad part is that the parking lot is pretty far away and carrying our bags that far and also walking that far each time became tiresome. The rooms are very nice. Plenty of space in both closet and drawers and plenty of space to move around in. The beds were comfortable. The room was clean and the maids did a great job during the week includling putting the wash clothes in the shape of animals around the sink spicuts and on vanity. Having two sinks outside of the toilet/tub room is very helpful at getting ready in the morning and having a curtain to pull to seperate the sink area from the sleeping area also allowed us to get ready while our daughter slept. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that the closet area was basically \"open.\" The tub was a full size with a seat area. Very nice since many hotels now have smaller tubs. Nice tile and again, all kept clean. The hotel has a food court which had plenty of selections for all meals. We were on the dining plan and so that helped but if we weren't, their food is somewhat expesive. TIP: purchase a souvenier mug the first day. You can take it back anytime and get free refills during your stay. Excellent value. Very nice gift shop and game room. Their lobby is very nice and I found the desk staff to be friendly and helpful. (there was an errant charge on our final bill from another Disney hotel that we had dined at and the Port Orleans desk staff did a great job of getting it fixed!) The pool is fantastic! It is the best pool on Disney property. Great slide and lifeguards. My daughter loved it. Very large and never seemed crowded. Your stay includes free parking at all of the Disney Parks and the other hotels so you can drive where you want. You can also take the free Disney bus service, which had a pick-up point in front of the hotel lobby, to the parks, Downtown Disney and the other hotels. The Port Orleans also offers a free boat trip to either Downtown Disney or Port Orleans-Riverside. Activities are limited at the French Quarter, but you could walk, drive or the take the boat the short distance to the Riverside section which offered bike and boat rentals as well as carriage rides.

The rooms were immaculate, cleaned every day, The facilities at POFQ were excellent although not impressed with the restaurant, we classed it more as a canteen rather than an actual restaurant. We only ate there once, which was quite early in the morning. The second time we went it was packed and there was a long wait for food so we didn't bother and went out for breakfast to Ponderosa or Sizzlers. The pool was excellent and there were free towels available. Lots of sunbeds. We chose this hotel because we thought it would be quieter and it was. On reflection we would have preferred staying at POR as it was larger and had more facilities or the Caribbean. In fact POR or Caribbean would have been a better choice for our teenage kids. Would highly recommend this hotel as a Disney moderate hotel although if we went to Disney again and stayed on site, we would probably pick the budget hotels.

Called front desk and they were very gracious and asked if we could wait until the morning and they would take care of things. It did mean we had to pack and have the bell captain store our bags until we got back from the parks that day...so it cost us a few bucks in tips to get this right! It was worth it, though! We got rooms right near the pool...and a hop away from the food court! Very nice! In the smaller moderate hotel rooms, we have found that having adjoining rooms makes it feel more like a suite! French Quarters is our favorite moderate. The food court is small...but the entertainment (this great sax player!!!) at night in the bar is great! You can always walk over to Riverside for a larger food court. The food is really the same, but you don't feel so claustrophobic at the Riverside. The gift shop and lobby are nicely done ~ and you have the feel of Mardi Gras! I like the pool and the pool bar! By the afternoon, it can get crowded with kids because of the slide ~ but early morning and late night, it is great!!! French Quarter seems to have less kids than Riverside ~ probably because you can sleep 5 in Riverside with a trundle bed. The only issue this year was the bus service. They seemed to be verrrry slow ~ and infrequent. (When there are a lot of wheelchairs and scooters, the wait is even longer) Waited our first full day for over 50 minutes (still no bus - and the bus area was loaded with people - so you knew they needed more that one bus to get us all to the park) SO ended up taking the bus to Downtown (marketplace) and spent the better part of the day shopping, instead of at the Magic Kingdon, like we planned. If you are relying on the buses to get you somewhere for dinner (like a resort hotel), you are better off taking a taxi. Our concierge gave us bad information. Told us we could get to the Yacht Club (where we had dinner reservations) by taking a bus to MGM and then another bus to the Yacht Club!!! NOT!! There is NO bus that goes from the MGM Studios to the Yacht and Beach Club. There is a boat. BUT by the time we got to the boat mooring, they were leaving and the next one wouldn't be there for 20 minutes. Had to call the restaurant (thank goodness for cell phones). Ended up walking the pathway ~ which took 20 minutes and it was lightning ... getting ready for a good thunderstorm. Made it to the restaurant just before the down pour - thankfully!!!!

I must say the property exceeded my expectations. Both my husband and I agreed that the pictures online did not do this hotel justice. Let's start at the beginning. Magical Express was seamless both there and on the way home. Disney welcomed us well with that! Although we arrived an hour and half or so before check-in, we walked right up and were able to check-in to our room.Our room was a standard room, and we got a courtyard view just as I had requested. There was no need to spend extra money on a riverview! Our room was in building 7. We faced out to a courtyard, and we could see the river as soon as turned left out of our room. Building 7 is the farthest building (I believe) from the main building, but we loved it! We found the walk to the bus and lobby to be just a few blocks. We loved the quietness of our building. My only complaints about our room are minor - the paint could be touched up in a few spots as there were some scuff marks and the wooden coffee tray could be replaced as it had some pretty bad rings. The beds were comfy though and the room was always clean. Cast members were all very friendly. Some of the things we enjoyed at the FQ were: the boat rides to Downtown Disney, swimming in FQ's great pool, live saxophone music in the lobby at night, getting freshly made beignets from the food court, and renting bikes from neighboring Riverside on a gorgeous FL morning. The buses were pretty packed, and the lines for Port Orleans hotels seemed to be the longest at the end of the day. However, when we checked in, the cast member did say that they were 100% booked during our stay. The sister hotels could probably use separate buses though as Riverside is a huge resort. I have now stayed at a Disney value resort, moderate, and deluxe hotel as well as off-property. I stayed at All Star Music with my high school choir, and French Quarter is definitely a step above. The all star resorts have a kid/youth feel throughout...and talk about distances from the lobby to the room! The deluxe hotel I have stayed at was Wilderness Lodge. I absolutely loved it there. While the WL was majestic and awe-inspiring, the French Quarter was absolutely charming. It (the FQ) was a wonderful and relaxing getaway (as well as romantic) after a long day at the busy parks.

We were there for five nights (9/7/07-9/12/07), and I'll try to break it down a bit into sections: We used the Disney Magical Express on our arrival. We didn't have too much trouble finding our bus, as this was our second time to use it and it seemed slightly familiar. Just don't be afraid to ask people where to go, as there really aren't a lot of signs for it. When we boarded the bus, there were only about five empty seats toward the back. (We arrived on a Saturday). I don't know how long some of the people already on board had been waiting, but by the looks of them and the antsy-ness of the kids, it could have been awhile. We then proceeded to wait another 20 minutes ourselves, while another two or three couples/families boarded and the bus was filled. We finally left the airport, stopping first at Old Key West, then the Coronado Springs resorts, then finally the Port Orleans French Quarter. I made sure I was one of the first ones off the bus here (!). Of course, we had no luggage since they handle all of that for you. Check-in: This was our second time here, so we knew right where to go. The man at check-in was very polite and helpful. I had sent a fax seven days prior to our arrival asking for room 5317, the same room we had before. It's a waterview room, in bldg. 5. It overlooks the river, and is a corner room close to the elevator and the pool. We liked the location on our prior trip. We were happily pleased to find we were allocated the same room again. Room: The room was clean, no problems with it at all other than the light that is on the hair-dryer (serves as kind of a night-light when all the other lights are out) would flicker at night. It didn't bother us enough to call maintenance. The fridge was cold, the TV was fine the few times we turned it on. The beds (two doubles) were comfy, plenty of storage, etc. We did bring up some extra towels from the pool area to have in our room because we do tend to take more showers than the average family and we like to have clean towels. Pool: As mentioned in prior reviews, there were always three lifeguards, very attentive and great with the kids. One of them even got in the water after his shift and played some catch with the kids! The pool here is great, and the slide is fun. I had a couple of margaritas at the pool bar ($8 each), and my son had a slushy drink ($5). Plenty of towels, also. They shut the slide and fountains off at 8pm, but you can still swim, just no lifeguards. Food court: We didn't use it a whole lot. My husband would use a counter service credit for his breakfast, my son would get yogurt and I would get coffee, using snack credits for those. We stopped and got ice cream there once, also. We didn't get the refillable cups, I liked to take my coffee with me on the bus in the morning, and didn't want to be carrying the cup around with me the rest of the day. Bus service at POFQ: The buses stop here pretty regularly. It's the first stop for all the buses other than the Downtown Disney/Typhoon Lagoon bus. And, most of the Magic Kingdom buses aren't shared with Riverside. To go to any of the other resorts, however, you need to head to one of the parks or Downtown Disney and transfer to the other resort's bus. For being a slower time, the buses were quite crowded, we thought. Bus service picking up at the parks was quite a wait sometimes. We ended up standing quite a few times. Boat service: Boat service can be very slow at peak times. We waited a LONG time to get on a boat in the early evening (6-7pm). Then, on the way back around 10pm, there was such a long line that we would have waited over an hour to board the boat again, so we decided to take a bus back. Parks, weather, lines, restaurants & such: For table service, we ate at the Coral Reef restaurant, it was the best meal of our trip. We had the evening buffet at Chef Mickeys (not always offered), it was just okay. We had to wait a long, long time to get pictures with all of the characters. A pet peeve: If you have a table with more than four people at it, try not to monopolize the characters' time. Some people would have the character pose individually with each person, and then again with the kids, then with the parents, then with all of them and snag a waiter to take a picture....they did this with each character as they went by. Then, they got both Mickey & Minnie in on the act....meanwhile, everyone else is waiting, and waiting, and waiting.... How rude! Anyway, we also ate at the Polynesian, at the O'Hana thing that they do on the big skewers...not so good. On our final night we wasted two table service credits on the California Grill restaurant. The food was just slightly above average, we all had steak. The service was good, and we did manage to score a window-side seat with a good view of the fireworks over Cinderella's castle. But I just expected the food to be better. Our food was better at the Coral Reef! The parks weren't overly busy. We did score a Dream Fast Pass when we were coming off of the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride, but it was hardly worth it as most of the lines were under 10 minutes long that day. We also got a lanyard with two collectible pins on it (three of us, so six pins total), which my son quickly traded with cast members for some of his favorite characters. They called it a \"Double Dream Day\" or some such thing. That was nice. This was our first time to do a Disney waterpark. We went to Typhoon Lagoon. Our 6yo son enjoyed it so much that we went back the next day! His counter-service lunch came in a sand bucket with a shovel, and he spent a lot of time playing in the sand there. The place gets really busy, good luck finding a shady area if you get there after 11am. We figured it out the first day, you have to coral yourself an area with chairs, putting stuff on them, leaving an empty spot in the middle for the kids to play, and not leave an area for people to walk thru, or else you're constantly in the flow of traffic. It's wall-to-wall beach chairs here. The wave pool is fun, but the waves build up pretty high. There are a lot of fun rides for kids in the 6yo range. We were disappointed with MGM this year. We showed up at 4:30pm, thinking we would ride a few rides before the Fantasmic show at 8pm...well, we went on one ride, then at 6pm all the rides closed down! What the heck! I had no idea that was going to happen! Even the kid's play area, \"Honey I Shunk The Kids\", closed down. So, we just left there and headed back to our hotel to swim, we weren't going to wait around for two hours doing nothing. Weather was hot, in the low 90's every day. We had rain a couple of afternoons, but only once did it pour enough that it disrupted our plans. We tried to wait it out, but had dinner reservations so we finally bought ponchos. ($7 adult, $6 child). About 10 minutes after we bought them, it stopped raining. Go figure. The other times it rained it didn't inconvenience us as we were riding the bus, or at the waterpark (already wet!), or doing something else. It's very humid there this time of year. Magical Express going home: We were using AirTran, so we were able to check in at the POFQ. We checked our bags there, and they gave us boarding passes, or so we thought. However, you still have to wait in line at the airport, just like you normally would, when you get there, and get a different boarding pass. Hmmm. The only thing you don't have to do is schlep your own luggage around. We like the Port Orleans French Quarter, and it will always be our resort of choice when we go to DisneyWorld, unless we decide we want to upgrade to one of the deluxe resorts. For the money, it can't be beat.

We particularly enjoyed our walks along the Sassagoula River. We had absolutely no complaints regarding the bus or boat transporation. It was a pleasure taking the boat over to Downtown Disney which we loved, and the buses to the parks were fine - no complaints! The food court food was okay, nothing special. You do get kind of tired of it after a while, so adding some other restaurants to your itinerary is a good idea.

It was his first time staying on property, while I have stayed at the Poly, BW, and POR. We booked the trip to take advantage of the free dining offer, and chose POFQ due to the compact size of the resort. We had a very good experience with the resort. Check in went smoothly - had no wait at the reservation desk, and the cast member helping us was happy to answer all of our questions. We quickly hopped a bus to Epcot where the driver asked everyone to repeat back to him which bus stop belonged to POFQ. We had a late dinner that evening, and left Epcot around 9:40 and then encountered a huge line for the bus. We were convinced it would take at least an hour to get back to the resort, but Disney quickly started sending additional buses to the stop with 2 buses loading at a time - our overall wait was 25 minutes and 8 buses. Bus service during the week was generally good. Most were crowded, but as the POFT stop is before POR we never had trouble getting a seat. With the exception of our first night, we never waited more than 15 minutes for transportation. We also found the drivers to be very friendly, and we never walked off a bus without the driver making an announcement as to which stop to return to. The lines for the bus service to POFQ/POR always seemed to have the most people in them, but our buses also seemed to be amongst the more frequently appearing ones at the parks. The resort itself was wonderfully themed - we loved how compact it was and the grounds were maintained beautifully. The Mardi Gras characters are a little over the top, but they were quite popular with the under 7 set. Food court was always clean, and we never had problems getting a table in the morning. The line for the beignets could be slow-moving, but we'd rather have them freshly made and wait the extra 10 minutes. Our room was a 2 minute walk from the main building and bus stop, and a 4 minute walk from the main pool. We found our room to be exactly what we expected. The linens, while certainly not 5 star quality, were clean and always changed daily as were the towels. We had no problems with dust or dirty carpets. My DH actually had to pull back the dresser after a phone charger dropped behind it and that area was also remarkably clean. All in all, we very much enjoyed the resort and have no real complaints. I would return there without any hesitation and have no concerns recommending it. It's not a 5 star resort, nor does it try to be - if that is what you are looking for, this is not the right place. Disney does not offer a business center in their moderate hotels. The corridors are exterior rather than interior. At the end of the trip, we were happy with the resort and feel that we received a good value for the money spent.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Valley NJ", "Title": "\u201cA Very Nice Stay\u201d", "Author": "chrisfigz", "ReviewID": "UR10007321", "Content": "Wife, 3 1/2 year old daughter and myself stayed in the French Quarter last week and were very pleased with this hotel.

Close enough to the pool, lobby & food court, but far enough away to be quiet. We found the rooms to be very quiet at night - no issues with noise. FOOD COURT - we ate most breakfasts and an occasional lunch here. what we ate was good. Even though it is a \"food court\" almost everything is made to order. POOL - pool was awesome. My daughter loved the slide (so did I). NOTE - when ligeguards are off duty the slide is closed. So that night swim will not include the slde. SERVICE - from check in to check out everyone greeted us with a smile and was a pleasure to deal with. We requested a bed rail when we checked in and one was brought immediately. TRANSPORTATION - this is the reason my review is not 5 stars. While it is easy to use and gets you where you want to be, it could be slow at times. If going to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot, the bus is direct from the FQ. If going to Animal Kingdom, MGM, Downtown or the water parks - you stop in Riverside also (4 stops). Overall a very good stay.

We chose French Quarter based on price and looks. The atmoshpere there was very relaxed and fun loving. We liked the decor and the room, although the love bug were a bit of an annoyence. Anyway about the hotel, it is very nicely decorated with a look toward the french quater from the decor around the room etc. We loved the fact you could catch a nice boat trip to downtown disney, we took it one night to go see Cirque. The show was awesome. Some of the things we did not like is the buses, they were always packed and seemed like it took forever to get to the parks because after they pick up at the french quarter they go to all the stops at riverside to pick up too. That makes the trip alot longer then it should be considering you are within a couple miles of every park. Another thing was we came back to the room after a day at one of the parks to find out that our door was not fully closed after room service had been by. Thankfully nothing had been taken. We did inform the desk clerk about this and then proceeded to leave the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door the rest of the trip. We did get new towels and sheets and such during the week but did not feel comfortable letting them in again. The other thing both my wife and I commented on was the feel of the \"Resort\", the way the hotel was set up felt more like a HIGH prices motel as opposed to a resort.

We also stayed here in Sept. 2005. I previously gave it a 4 star rating. I now give it an overall 3.5 star. Those who go will most likely experience the following: Magical Express Check-in- At the airport, apparently Disney was not expecting these crowds. We waited over an hour and half for the bus to take us to the hotel. Had we arranged our own transportation, we could have saved a large amount of time versus saving a few bucks. They do handle your luggage but one must weigh the pros and cons. The first time we used the service it went smooth. Not this time. Check-in at the hotel- Well, this is where I encountered a not so friendly impression. I requested building 5 when I made the reservation. We stayed in building 5 the first time and enjoyed it for our anniversary. I know nothing is guaranteed as they are eager and happily to tell you. I also reiterated building 5 the week of our arrival and the day before our arrival. At check-in, the notes weren't read nor was the request honored. Lesson learned: hmmm you decide. The hotel is still nice. There are tree lined, cobblestoned streets and the quiet ambiance with an occasional horse and carriage still outweigh the check-in experience. The hotel room is basic and the provided toiletries are very minimal. They give you a one small bottle of shampoo. They use to give you lotions, mending kits, etc. Not anymore......but the price of the hotel increased substantially since 2005. The pool- Very nice with an ample amount of chairs and space. As mentioned in other reviews, they have a strict code of safety. Lots of lifeguards. When thunder is heard the pool area is closed but pool bar which is still located in the pool area was still open. Hmmm$$ Restaurant food- All around the Disney complex, we were very pleased. The food was plentiful, reasonable and actually tasted better than theme park food. One complaint though. We were on the dining plan which I recommend to everyone. It was offered for free in the months of August and September. Ironically, some menus changed in August and some semi-expensive items (steaks) were taken off the menus. Les Chefs France (Epcot) and Wolf Gangs Cafe (Downtown Disney) no longer have steaks available. I made a call to the Disney Dining plan as we were waiting to be seated at Les Chefs France. The representative even mentioned that the restaurants have steaks. Lesson learned: Don't plan to eat specific items. Disney restaurants don't even know what they are going to have. THIS IS NOT A PORT ORLEANS COMPLAINT. Bus Service to and from the parks- Excellent Riverboat sevice- Excellent Rainy day ponchos- $7.00 ......extortion Check out- Airline check-in for magical express- Rather than going into it, the 2 employees were not very friendly and borderline argumentative with people. Conclusion- Overall Disney experience was still good. Hotel has a few more isolated problems than before. As price keeps going up, we will consider another resort or destination.

Check-in went smoothly and our room was ready at 9:00am, but when I asked questions at the check-in desk, I really do not want to see the Cast Member rolling his eyes at another associate because he feels that I am asking too many questions. All I asked was if he could check if there were any corner rooms available. As he was explaining my package I asked \"How do I get there?\" or \"where can I redeem this voucher?\" Very simple questions to answer, but for someone who is unfamiliar with the property, I don't feel these were out of line. Unfortunately, this poor attitude seemed to keep popping up, throughout the parks. Questions like... Am I on the right bus to EPCOT or Where do I catch the bus for POFQ and most of the time my questions were answered with \u201cI don't know\" with no further response. Our room (6202) was clean and in good condition. It was nicely decorated, quiet and everything was in working order. BUT this is Disney and we expected something a little more special... Don\u2019t expect any extras. We received 1 shampoo and 1 soap, per day and we were encouraged to use our towels and let them air dry, to use again. The beds were comfortable, but sheets and mattress pads would not stay in place on the bed & the fridge was not cold enough. (no control to adjust). I called maintenance & housekeeping, but only the fridge was fixed. There is only one elevator and one ice vending area per building. The 25\u201d TV has a clear picture but too many Disney channels. The Theme Parks were not crowded and we never waited more than 10 minutes for any attraction including Expedition Everest & Tower of Terror, until we visited The Magic Kingdom where most of the wait times were 30 minutes or more. Considering this, there is no reason to expect a ten minute ride, back to our hotel would take 1-1/2 hours. This happened 4 times and not at a busy time of day. Disney\u2019s internal bus system is inadequate, to say the least. Our last night, several irate patrons had words, because one thought the other was cutting in line. It was a very uncomfortable situation, the driver did nothing and there was no security around. If you have a car and are staying in a Disney hotel you will get free parking at the theme parks. We used this option, to avoid the long crowded bus rides, on several occasions. The pool is great fun, spotless and large enough not to feel overcrowded. Lifeguards (3) were attentive and constantly walking around the pool. Towels were plentiful. We had reservations at Cap\u2019n Jacks, Kona Caf\u00e9 at the Polynesian, Olivia\u2019s at Old Key West, Mama Melrose\u2019s at MGM and the Concourse Steakhouse in the Contemporary. The service and food was great at all except The Concourse Steakhouse. Even with reservations, a long wait and poor manners seem to be the norm here and the food was only mediocre. Make your dining reservations as soon as you can. I spoke with a woman who had been at Disney for two days, on the Dining plan and had used only counter service credits, because she could not get reservations for table service. Try the resorts for your table service but be prepared if using Disney transportation. From other Resorts, you can only transfer to Downtown Disney then to your hotel by bus or boat. Counter service meals that deserve honorable mention are Columbia Harbor House in Liberty Sq. at Magic Kingdom and Sunshine Seasons at The Land in Epcot.

This is a wonderful hotel which we didn't want to leave. We arrived at about 7.30p.m. very tired having been travelling for 12 hours. We went to check in got seen to straight away everything was in order ready for us got our room cards the man on the desk gave my 15 year old his card and told him to sign it so he could use it to charge things to the room with my permissions, my son loved this it made him feel very grown up. Next the man asked my youngest if this was his first visit when he said yes the man gave him a special badge saying first visit and a load of stickers, he was thrilled. We then went to the room it was very close to the shop, pool, restaurant, ect but facing a lovely courtyard which had a fountain in the middle. The room was on the third level there was a lift up. Opened the door the room was lovely air conditioned. There were 2 king sized beds which were extremely comfortable. Every where was very clean there was a low bath with shower over , with a small shelf where there was 2 bars of mickey soap also 2 bottles of shampoo . There was a toilet which was very clean. In the main room there was 2 sinks with a shelf over a hairdryer, iron and ironing board 12 wooden coat hangers. There was a large shelf which I put the cases on to keep them out of the way. A large chest of draws with 4 large draws and 2 small draws plenty of space for all our stuff . on top of this was a large TV. In the middle of the room there was a ceiling fan. The room was cleaned every day beds changed every 3 days. I did phone room service 1 day to ask if they could change the sheets that day as my son had spilt his drink on it they did this no problem. The hotel itself seemed very quite, even around the pool there was never much noise. The pool was quite large with a serpent slide which the boys loved. there was always clean towels by the pool and plenty of them . There is a bar by the pool but didn't use it so cant really comment on it. Loads of sun loungers there was always some to use. Pool was very clean and it had at least 4 lifeguards . We found the restaurant excellent it was only counter service but plenty of choice we ate here most nights always freshly made food lovely friendly staff a couple of nights my son would go to the restaurant and fetch us some tea and bring it to the room the staff would put covers over the plates for him. We brought refillable cups at the start of our holiday for $11.99 each we definitely had our moneys worth you can refill them with different fizzy pops , juice , coffee iced tea hot chocolate water. There is a bar inside also but never used it although did listen to the jazz band for a while very good. There was a shop which sold lots of Disney stuff ,drink,snacks tablets a bit of every thing really. The staff in the shop were excellent helpful and friendly even gave me free batteries when my sons ran out in his pal mickey. The buses for all the parks picked you up just outside the lobby never waited more than 10 Min's for a bus and only had to stand once.

I found our stay faultless. The rooms were very clean and well kept. Sheets were changed every 3 nights so you were always sleeping in a fresh bed. Our tv remote was missing and within 10 minutes of reporting it - a porter arrived with a brand new one. All rooms are now non-smoking and were supplied with a safe, refrigerator (which was very quiet) and tv with disney channels. The maid surprised our children with novelties made from face cloths i.e Dog, Rabbit, Teddy dressed in a skirt and other items with the towels etc. Our kids couldn't wait to see what was there! BIG TIP - buy the refillable mugs $11.99 you could have free refills for the duration of your stay - these included sodas, coffee, water, hot chocolate and tea. Pool was great with a slide for the kids (or bigger kids)- open until midnight every day. Endless supply of towels were available at the pool (you just help yourself) - watch out if you want to go swimming when a storm is iminent - the pool is closed for safety reasons. Food - great value for money. Breakfast was our favourite! You could choose various items from the food court. From full breakfast, waffles and pancakes - to fresh yoghurt, cereals and pastries. Lunch and dinner ranged from salads, pot roasts, burgers/chicken strips and pasta with meatballs. Good childrens choice, which came with a free drink as well for $3.99 We were pleasantly surprised that the meal prices were reasonable. Nice pool bar with tasty cocktails - try them! Our room was situated in block 4, we found this quieter but easy to get to the restuarant and reception desk. I would say that all the rooms are well situated as this is a smaller resort - unless you dont like a bit of a walk opt for building 5 or 2 but beware of overlooking the pool as there are a lot of people that use the pool up to closing at 12am! River boat to Downtown and Riverside resort is excellent, the views are great and would recommend it. We also hired a boat which I have to say - is a must everyone enjoyed it! Buses are excellent - they pick up at French Quarter first before going on to Riverside and normally drop you off first unless you go to/from Downtown Disney- this was invaluable when you are tired. TIP: pick the bus up from Marketplace and not Pleasure Island in Downtown as if the bus is full they will bypass Pleasure Island (although the drivers deny it) - we waited 45 mins before one even appeared during a rainstorm so beware! Disney magic hours were great, use them!! If you allow your credit card to be charged to your room at time of registration, you will be able to express check out. If you need for room past the 11.00am check out they will allow you to keep the room for free until 1.00pm if you ask provided you registered your card at the beginning of your holiday. (They dont tell you that though - you have to request it.) You can also keep your room longer if you pay a portion of the room rate - just ask reception.

Our housekeeper Irene did a great job with clean towels and our room cleaned every day. We even had 5 different animal towels made for us during our stay. The food court was fine and the staff at the French Quarter were pleasant. We used the Disney bus and didn't have to wait too long (although it does get busy, people at FQ are the 1st to be picked up and 1st to dropped off later).

Unlike some of the other mega hotels this hotel was small in overall size making it a short walk to the restaurant or to the buses to the park.

As with all hotels you do wonder what you will be arriving at and hoping that the accommodation lives up to expectations. The French Quarter is the smaller of the two parts to Port Orleans approximately 1/3 the size of Riverside with only one bus stop and one pool (Riverside has more pools and 3 bus stops). This gives the resort a small and friendly feel to it. **Reception Polite staff who were always cheers and helped me deal with our holiday insurance company when I had to fax details to them. The concierge is worth a visit as they hold small half-A5 size cards containing brief and accurate directions to many of the local parks and shops. **Room Our room was located in building 3, two minutes walk from the reception, busses, swimming pool and boat to Disney Village. Our room was spacious enough for two adults and two children and appeared to be newly decorated and well presented. The carpets had been cleaned that day ready for our arrival. The room consisted of two \u00be sized double beds, TV, air conditioning, fan, two sinks, safe and bathroom with toilet. Larger framed people may struggle with two adults to a bed but this wasnt a problem for us and the beds were very comfy. The usual towel animals awaited our arrival and the room was cleaned each day by the housekeepers. **Restaurant There is only one restaurant and shop on the French Quarter but it serves a suffucient variety of foods for most purposes from pancakes and waffles to fruit and cereals. One thing worth purchasing is the souvenir cup for $11 each which entitles you to free refills for the duration of the holiday. The on-site shop sells souvenirs, some snacks and drinks and newspapers (including the UK Daily Mail) **Pool The pool is open 24hrs albeit lifeguards head off duty about 10pm. The water is warm and there are plenty of sunbeds to be had in the evening. Cant comment on the daytime as we didnt hang around the hotel. There is a small bar serving beers and cocktails. **Transport Being in a Disney hotel, there are buses to all the disney theme parks every twenty minutes and a river boat which can take you to Disney Village. It is worth noting that French Quarter guests are the first to be picked up and also have their own boat service which misses out having to travel via riverside.", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "birmingham", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT\u201d", "Author": "yay018", "ReviewID": "UR8219610", "Content": "everyone of my family enjoeyed every second of it, it was truly fantastic. the atmosphere created there was great.. by the look on peoples faces there its obvious they liked it...i would recommend this hotel to all ages..parents children you name it thy'll love it!", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Pool but Prefer Other Resorts\u201d", "Author": "JoanK", "ReviewID": "UR8208978", "Content": "Over the years we have stayed at just about every Disney resort but this was our first visit to the Port Orleans.

Each time we waited for a bus, we waited a maximum of 15 minutes, which isn't bad. While at this hotel we ate at the restaurant they have for breakfast and although the prices are a bit steep for the quality of food, its expected at Disney. For 2 adult platters and drinks we paid $18.00. This included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and a biscuit. Honestly for that amount of money you can go to Denny's and spend the same or less, however the service is very quick and its mostly for convenience purposes. Check out was very easy as they leave an invoice hanging from your door so you know how much you've spent, therefore, if everything looks Kosher, you can just walk out and go to your car! No hassles!

While the grounds are totally beautiful, this trip was not as flawless as last year. All the rooms at Disney are now non-smoking. However, our room clearly was a smoking room inthe past.

We did not pay for a river view room, but in building 1, some of the rooms on the corners are great. We saw water out our window, and still we were steps from the parking lot. ( at no extra charge.) Be sure to request a first floor room as the elevators in this resort are not centrally located. We have a 7 year old and she loved the pool. The slide is just fast enough for her to have a good time. The jr high crowd would be bored. There were enough life jackets to go around and the life guards were firm, fair and fun. The shower house/ bathrooms were spotless and I bathed the older daughter there twice when the little one was crabby. The pack-n-play crib was not so spotless. While the crib sheets provided were fresh and clean, the p-n-p was not. It had dirty spots and holes in the sides. I wiped it out with several anti-bacterial wipes before I put the baby down. The mini-fridge was housed in a end table-type cabinet. It did not close properly and was really scraped and banged up. I expect better from Disney. However, it really got very cold and even froze some of the watermelon we had brought for breakfast. The beds are small (double, full... whatever) As a restless sleeper, the bed is just too small for me. I requested extra blankets and pillows, and the 7 year old slept on the floor. For the price and beauty of the resort.... I can live with this!!! The double sinks and privacy curtain are terrific. My husband can dress in privacy and not hide in the too small bathroom. Mousekeeping was just fine. My only gripe was that they did not refresh the coffee packets. (a ploy to send us to the expensive food court?) When we asked, the front desk gave us plenty. Rooms were cool and tidy when we returned. We ate only one meal at the food court. It was regular Disney fair. Tasty and pricey, but not smashing.

On the plus side, these resorts have a little more to them than the \"budget\" resorts (All-Star Resorts). Having stayed at the other moderate resorts, my first choice would be FQ. Most of the moderate resorts are extremely large and spaced out. Sometimes the bus service needs to make several stops at the resort. The FQ, while still big, is smaller than the other moderate resorts. Also, FQ is part of the general Port Orleans complex which includes New Orleans Riverside. Riverside is divided by Magnolia Bend (Southern Mansion theme) and Alligator Bayou (Bayou Theme). Magnolia Bend and Alligator Bayou share pools, food courts, etc. The FQ is smaller and does not share its amenities with the others. The FQ is based on, you guessed it, the French Quarter. The New Orleans French Quarter theme is not overly done is and is quite nice. Actually, the \"real\" French Quarter bares no resemblance to this resort and that can be a good thing! While the real French Quarter is more of an adult drinking party, this place is very family oriented. Think more southern charm and iron work surrounding gardens than Mardi Gras. It is usually the first bus stop back at the Port Orleans complex from the parks and that can be very important after a long day. Also, if you take the river boat to Downtown Disney it is closer than Magnolia Bend or Alligator Bayou and you don't need to wait for other stops. As a result it is the last to pick you up and first to drop you off and that is a good thing. The size also makes the resort manageable. If you have kids they will love the pool with a dragon themed slide. My kids really enjoyed the pool complex. The grounds were very nice and the gardens added a special touch. On those hot Florida days, the shade is definitely welcome. For us, we think the FQ is nicer than the other moderate resorts and more akin to the other Deluxe resorts. The main difference with this resort and the Deluxe resorts, besides price, is the outside entry to the rooms and no enclosed hallways. Also, as with all moderate resorts, you need to take a bus if you are relying on Disney Transportation and that can sometimes be a little frustrating and time consuming. The rooms were nicely decorated and comfortable for 2 adults and 2 children. Our main complaint here was the bedding. Although our room had two beds, they were barely capable of sleeping two average size adults. They were just a step over a single twin bed. I don't know why Disney could not improve the bedding size with these rooms. Our other complaint is that we were placed in a room that was recently reclassified from a smoking room to a non-smoking room and it reeked horribly. The Disney hotels have gone to all Non-Smoking rooms as of June 1, 2007. As a result some of the old smoking rooms are now non-smoking and still smell like old, musty cigarette smoke. Although they informed us that they had cleaned the rooms of old smells, they certainly were not successful with this room. We needed to change our rooms and it wasn't fun. When you do check in make sure you do not receive one of the recently reclassified rooms. As far as the food it is unremarkable. It does have a food court which is similar to the other moderate and budget resorts. Not too much to count on here. We ate most of our meals in other locations. Other than those items noted above, It is a good place for couples or families. It is a quiet property and a nice escape from the theme parks. As for our family we would go back again -- just not stay in a recently classified non-smoking room.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridgnorth, Shropshire, UK.", "Title": "\u201cJust Fantastic.

The housekeeping was excellant it was lovely to come back after a long day at the parks and have the beds made and the room cleaned. The location of this resort is the best of all the resorts I think as it is right next to downtown disney and takes only a few minutes by car, the resort offers a lovely boat trip which takes around 20 minuates along a river which runs at the back of the resort, you can either get on a boat to downtown disney or on one to riverside. the busses also run very regular, also there are busses to all the parks. horse and carriages ride all around the resort for 35 dollars too. you do get a little extra when staying in a disney hotel,free parking in all disney parks, extra magic hours 1 hr in a morning and 3 hrs at night, plus you can arrange for all your shopping to be delivered to your hotel when shopping in any disney store in walt disney world, I took advantage of this and it was a great help.

I was there with my husband, my parents, and my sister and her husband. It was my parents' 30th anniversary. Overall the property was pretty, and the grounds were lovely, and very well maintained. The ambience as you walked around was quite nice, especially if you walked along the \"river\" that ran along the back of the hotel. We all had king-bed rooms that were in building 7, and faced the river. It was very quiet back there, which we liked. I thought the rooms were beautifully decorated, and quite spacious for a \"moderate\" resort. We didn't have any problem with the housekeeping service. In my room, we recieved a cute towel-animal the first night, and then cute little baskets for our toiletries every other night. We used the Disney Magical Express service, and it went a lot better than expected. We had our baggage within 1 hour of our arrival at the hotel. We also found the Disney transportation to be adequate to get around to all of the parks. There's a wait sometimes, and it can get crowded, but being we're from NYC, we're used to having to deal with public transportation issues. If you're looking to go from resort to resort, I would suggest renting a car. Our only complaints have to do with the overall service with the resort. When we checked in at noon, only two of the three rooms were available, and even though they had checked in first, it was my parents who had to wait for their room! Now we understand that check-in is late afternoon (I think 2 or 3) but my parents were told they wouldn't have a room until after 5:00 that night! WIth an 11:00 a.m. check-out there is no excuse why a room shouldn't be ready by 3:00 p.m., the latest. The absolute worst experience was on our last day there. We decided to use the \"convenient\" airline check-in located in the lobby. Needless to say, this was a HUGE mistake, and ruined our last day. Please save yourself a lot of heartache, and just check-in at the airport, where the workers have a much better grasp of the English language than the two women who work at this counter. Since they are not technically Disney employees, the hotel was unwilling (and unable) to do anything but get us to the airport 4 hours earlier so that we could resolve the issue with the airline directly.

And with a little help from our travel agent, boy did we strike it rich! Our vacation could NOT have been more PERFECT! The Port Orleans French Quarter was perfect for me, my wife, and our 2 girls. The resort was fabulous and our room was great. Our vacation consisted of Blizzard Beach on Sunday, Magic Kingdom on Monday, Epcot on Tuesday, Sea World & MGM on Wednesday, Animal Kingdom on Thursday, and then back to the Magic Kingdom on Friday. We purchased the Magic Your Way passes, NOT the park-hopper passes. And we feel THAT is the way to go. Pick ONE park per day and spend the entire day at that park. There's really no need to \"park hop\" unless you're not going to be at Disney long enough to visit each park. My recommendation is to stay long enough to visit each park. Another thing we did (and we are SO glad we did) was purchase the meal plan. WHAT A BARGAIN! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE MEAL PLAN TO EVERYONE; IT'S WELL WORTH THE MONEY! In the beginning I thought, \"we wont need the meal plan\" BUT the more people I talked to and the more research I did; I decided to go ahead a get the meal plan. IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION WITHOUT A DOUBT! Our kids loved the character meals! If staying at the Port Orleans, you have to eat at Boatwright's, which is located at the Port Orleans - Riverside, which is a short boat ride down the river. The food there is fabulous! Make your dinner reservations for your entire stay, the minute you arrive at the resort. I also recommend using the Fast Pass when available! This will save A LOT of time!

We enjoyed the hotel and services that much we are going again in 2008. The bus service to all parks was good about every 10 to 15 minutes sometimes crowded at certain times but your on holiday so what's the rush. Ideal for downtown disney, just jump on a boat if you want to be back for midnight take the boat, if not wait until 02.00 am and take the bus it really is that simple. Anyway don't take my word for it go try it, oh and if your thinking it is a bit more than say a budget hotel such as movies or sports , it is BUT you get a whole lot more for your money, you can see the fireworks from Epcot each night, take a quiet walk with the sound of crickets and bull frogs around the grounds, or simply sit in the moonlight with the sound of the fountain in the background. If that does not appeal then go down to the scat club for a drink and a listen to your friend Elliott Dyson who is an exceptional jazz playing muscian and a great personality. Take a horse drawn carriage ride up to riverside and back or hire a bike and cycle around the miles of pathways between the two hotels. We priced the budget hotels and read some of the reports BUT having been here once there really was no hard decision to make it just had to be Port Orleans.It gives you the balance you are looking for after a hard days walk around the parks in the Disney area, the resteraunt area is huge but as with all Disney hotels the food choice can be limited, but you can vary your choice of food with Downtown only a 10 minute boat ride away with the famous rainbow forest cafe of Fultons crab house and many more excellant dining facilities.

Our room had a great view so it is probably worth the extra few bucks for a waterview room. The bathroom was slightly under par - there was some soap residue in the shower which was obviously just dried on. And we also joked that they are definitely keeping with a 'French Quarter' look because the bathroom was a bit dingy and dark.

I also appreciated the non-hassle of self-parking as I find valet is expensive and time consuming. Anyway, Disney's transportation was, as usual, fantastic. Yes, the French Quarter is picked up first and dropped off first by the busses - that is an awesome little bonus. There is a boat launch inside of the French Quarter that takes you up the stream to the Riverside (the other property in Port Orleans) but that property pretty much identical to the French Quarter - just something to do to kill some time. There is also a paved path that connects the two resorts which we strolled on and it was very nice - well manicured, etc. The boat will also take you to Downtown Disney and they run very late, midnight I believe, so you can have a good time without driving. The last bus pickup from Downtown Disney is 2 a.m. I believe. At any rate, we orderd a veggie pizza one night (they will deliver it to your room from the food court!) and it was very tasty.

They have a large sit down dining hall which you could get all you want to eat or drink. Dont forget to purchase the refillable mugs at $11.99 each. These can also be taken to all parks for free drinks all day long so well worth the price. We purchased the dining plan before we left the UK and the ultimate park ticket. We made our dining reservations well in advance - a total must!! The food in all the restaurants in the parks were absolutely gorgeous. The portions are huge - be warned!! The dining plan is well worth the cost. The French Quarter has one large launderette - plenty of washers and driers - $2 to wash and $2 to dry. Both take approx 30 mins. I took my own washing powder as this saves money if you have kids!!! Otherwise powder can be bought as well. The river runs alongside the resort from Riverside to downtown Disney so you can either take the bus there or a lovely boatride. There is a hot tub to relax in at the end of a tiring day at the parks, a bar room to enjoy some jazz music with friends and family and of course a gift shop to buy those last minute souvenirs.

The bathroom was not as clean as I would have liked but certainly not filthy. The food was very average at the resort. I would strongly suggest the dining plan. It made things alot easier and much more affordable. Make sure and make reservations in advance for all your \"sit down\" table serve meals. Riverfront was much bigger and seemed nicer as far as the looks of it. The resturant at Riverfront was very good. We also ate at the California Grill which was quite possibly the best steak I have ever ate! It is semi- kid friendly and the food is different if you are used to Southern food(I'm from VA.)Lots of sushi! We also ate at the italian rest. in MGM. I wasn't that impressed with the food but the service was great. We had breakfast at the Polynesian Rest. which was awesome. The food was good(family style)and the characters were fun.

We enjoyed the drip filter coffee and tea in the room and the extra dressing area in the rooms--great to get luggage out of the way. The rooms were spacious and clean and the only 1 thing which wasn;t up to spped was the transfer from Orlando airport (Disney's magical express bus) We had booked in Australia directly online with Disney, however they never sent us the yellow luggage tags for our bags which meant, although we could use the bus transfer we had to collect our bags and drag them half way through Orlando airport and up a level to the Magical Express check in area-not good when your child has been ill all day The laundry facilities were also of great use and were clean and convenient to the pool area-so while my son and husband swam, I did the laundry and enjoyed a relaxing drink. The food court at the hotel served a selection of food but was a little on the pricey side. The boat transfer to Downtown Disney was lovely and the kids enjoyed it.

We were a party of 6 adults and 5 children aged 4, 5, 8, 8 and 11. French Quarter is relatively cheap and I got the impression it was an \u2018older\u2019 hotel (no idea when it was built though). It is unashamedly aimed towards young families. Nothing wrong with that, it is Disney afterall. A problem at check-in was not appreciated after booking 10 months previous and a long flight. This was quickly resolved and we were placed in block 7 for 2 nights before moving to more suitable accommodation in block 4 opposite the canteen. It was more noisy though so bear that in mind if that bothers you. FQ does lack choice on the menu in what is best described as a canteen. Two weeks of fast food and plastic forks is more than most can bear. Riverside is a better choice for (largely similar) food but is only a 10 minute stroll or boat ride away. Children love that type of thing. Riverside though, appears much more \u2018grown up\u2019 -- however picturesque it is. Quayside prettiness may be just plain un-nerving for parents of children 5 years old and younger. On the plus side, the frequent buses and free drinks refills were a bonus.

Great food hall- buy a Port Orleans mug on your first day for $11 and you can fill it for free throughout your whole stay!! Thats value for money. Disney shop on site that also stocks all your necessities and swim nappies for use in the pool. Buses run to all other Disney parks although we mostly used our car.

From there, we spent an additional week at St. Pete beach. Like most of us, I spent tons of time researching resorts at Disney including many visits to this site. We did not want to spend the $$$ for top of the line nor did we want to go value especially in April at holiday time. The French Quarter best fit what we wanted and more than met our needs during our stay. We flew into Orlando International Airport at about 12:30 PM and rented our vehicles. It is a short drive from the airport to French Quarter probably no more than 15 minutes. If you are renting a car, the roads are well marked as are the Disney resorts....we had no problem finding the French Quarter. Our Check in around 2:00 was very smooth as there were about 5 people working at the check in area. Our room key acted as our meal plan, park tickets and general charge card throughout the duration of our stay at FQ. There is a concierge desk located in the lobby where you can pick up theme park maps, make restaurant reservations, etc. I would recommend making your reservations in advance of your stay as most are already booked prior to arrivals. My mother and I stayed in a room with my 4 year old daughter and my cousins stayed in another with their combined three children in building two right across from the pool, facing the pool on the third floor. In spite of the location, we never found it to be too loud at night. If I had it to do over again, I would keep the same location but ask for a room on the first or second floor.......even though there is an elevator, it was located way down at the other end of our building making it a distant walk. We had requested a room close to the food court and the pool and found our location to be prime especially with kids My mother ( who is picky ) loved our room as did I. They are tastefully decorated and contain a table, two chairs and in our case, two double beds. There certainly was enough space for the three of us! My cousins even felt that with five in their room, they had plenty of 'elbow room'. The bathrooms are not large however the sinks and vanity area are located just outside the bathroom itself therefore we were not tripping over one another getting ready in the morning or in the evening. I believe there are a total of 7 buildings and from what I could see, none were a great distance from either the pool or restaurant though probably did take a bit more of a walk to get to the busses to go to the parks. Some of the buildings have water view room whcih face the river. From what I understand, the FQ is one of the smaller of all of the Disney resorts making it easier to manueaver around. During our stay, the FQ was at 100% capacity however it never felt that way. There were always tables available in the food quart, chairs and lounges around the pool and plenty of space in the pool. The food in the Sassagaloula restarant is what you would expect at any cafeteria/fast food sort of establishment....it is not 5 dtar however everything I had I found to be very good. It does offer what I feel is an ample selection for adults including chicken, ribs, burgers, pizza and a variety of salads for lunch/dinner as well as full breakfasts in the mornings including eggs, hash browns, bacon sausage, oat meal, a variety of cereals and fresh fruit, pancakes, french toast, etc. For children there are special kids meals including things such as chicken nuggets, fries, pizza, etc. In addition, they have prepared fruit cups, yogurts, juices, milk, bottled water available. We had also purchased the Disney meal plan for each person giving us breakfast, a larger meal ( dinner or lunch ) and a snack each day as well as a beverage at each meal and found this to be very worthwhile. I believe there are different types of meal plans that can be purchased though this is the one our travel agent recommended. It can be used at most any restaurant in Disney including the Theme Parks. I would check ahead of time to be sure that they take your particular meal plan. One afternoon we went to Downtwon Disney to go to the RainForest Cafe and discovered they did not take our particular meal plan and we did have to pay. There was no actual dollar limit on our particular plan which came in handy when we went to special meals at the Crystal Palace to do the Character Breakfast with Pooh and Friends as well as Breakfast with the Princesses. Our bill for two adults and one child would have been around $100 and of course more for my cousins. The French Quarter does not have an actual sit down restaurant however Port Orleans Riverside does and we ate there one evening. Again, our bill would have been high for three people but the meal plan took care of it. It is worth looking into before you travel. We did notice other guests at the resort had the Port Orleans cups giving free refills on beverages such as soda, coffee, tea, etc. I think they were $11.99 If you are planning to stay any length of time, it makes the initial cost worthwhile. It can also be used at both Port Orleans French Quarter and Riverside. The pool area was wonderful and was a nice mid afternoon reprieve after wandering around the parks. It has a great water slide that can be used by both adults and children and is actually like three pools in one with depths varying from 3 ft to just under 5 ft. There is also a separate kiddy pool as well. Just down the walkway is a hot tub. One feature that we really enjoyed was that we could walk to the back of the resor and catch a boat to Downtown Disney. It is a nice leaisurely ride taking about 15 minutes. The boats also run between FQ and Riverside making connection between the two resorts easy if you wnated to go to dinner at Riverside or partake of other activities there ( they have horse and buggy rides, rent bikes and boats, etc ). In the lounge on Wednesday through Sundays evenings, Elliot plays his variety of saxophones as well as other instruments. We found him very entertaining and freindly with everyone. He played all genres of music with a variety appleaing to both children and adults. His shows were a nice way to come home from the theme park later in the evening The busses to the theme parks run frequently and stop at FQ prior to Riverside. The first bus runs of the day were generally crowded and were standing room only though we always managed ot find seats provided we held the younger kids on our laps. I found most all other guests to be pleasant despite the crowded busses and parks. If you are willing to wait a bit, later busses tended to be less crowded that trying to catch the 6:15 AM bus the day Magic Kingdom is opening at 7 AM. The staff were all very helpful and friendly despite having large demands placed on them. I did not once during our entire stay find a person who could not answer our questions. I was sorry to leave when it was time however we plan to return to Disney in the next 2-3 years. Hands down we will stay at the FQ again. It is one of the nicest stays we have had out of all of the vacations we have taken.

Being a first timer at Disney, I wanted to make sure I gave my family the best experience I could afford to. I read literarily hundreds of reviews and they were right on the money. I picked the Port Orleans French Quarter because it was a much smaller resort than all the rest and it fit into my budget of moderately priced resorts. From the moment of our arrival to the minute we departed, the cast members (all Disney employees) could not have been nicer. The grounds were immaculate as was our room and the pool was gorgeous. From reading the reviews, I requested a specific corner room with a river view. I listed 4 or 5 rooms in order of preference and was granted my first choice; room 5317; building 5, third floor. When I do go back to Disney again, I won't need to spend the time researching resorts because I will definetely return here, except I would move down 5 rooms to 5323. Its a little farther away from the pool and has a nicer view of the river. Our room had a great view and close access to the stairs & elevators but I liked 5323 a touch better. Whichever building you ask for or are put in, you are not more than five minutes from anything, but request a corner room because the two windows make the room feel larger. Speaking of the room, it was very clean, up to date and always made-up upon our return. I never once saw the housekeeping staff in my room or at my door. We walked over to the sister resort, Port Orleans Riverside, and although there are a few more ammenities such as a sit down restaurant, marina, bike rentals, more pools and a better selection of food at the food court, we liked the tranquillity of the French Quarter. Riverside is beautiful with 2 story mansions on the opposite side of the river but it is much, much larger. I'm not sure how many units there are but its got to be 3-4K. French Quarter has 1004 units but it didn't feel like there were near that many. And besides, all of those ammenities I mentioned are less than a ten minute walk from any part of the French Quarter. All said and done, with two boys ages 8 & 10, having the option to take a boat to Downtown Disney instead of the bus and being able to get around easily without getting lost, I'm extremely happy with my choice. I would highly recommend French Quarter to anyone of any age and family size. One last thought, get the Disney Dining Option. Its a great value and you will eat like kings and queens.

To my surprise it turned out to be a disaster for my baby. We were checked into a wrong room by the front desk. The room was opened and our luggage checked in the room by the bellman, which i thought was good and I thanked him. But as the room was already open, we never used the room key initially. Now we left the room to look around and after an hour or so came back to the room (as baby was hungry) to realize that the room won't open with our card. Our baby was crying at this time as he was hungry. I ran up to the front desk and told them the situation while my wife was trying to calm the baby. At front desk there was an utter chaos. I eventually found someone who was able to understand the problem. She made several phone calls in front of me. Meanwhile I was getting nervous that my baby must be still crying as he was hungry and all his food and bottles were locked in the room. The lady at the front desk told me she will be sending someone to open the door. I went back towards the room and saw my wife crying as the baby wont stop crying. I calmed her by telling that someone is coming to open the door. We waited for more than 15 min and no one showed up. I became furious, but I kept my calm and went back to the front desk and demanded the manager. I never saw the manager at that time but a bellman showed up and I rushed him to the room. He opened the room and my wife was able to get the babies bottle. She was about the start feeding the baby...but the bellman told her that this room is reserved for someone else and it has to be emptied. I called the front desk and asked them why can't they let us stay in the same room as our luggage is already there. They told me that a group of people had requested rooms together and we have to go the other part of the building. All this time my baby was crying. So I asked for keys to the other room and asked the bellman to start moving luggage there. I took my baby and wife to the other room and FINALLY my baby was able to eat. Now I went to front desk and talked with front desk manager LAUREN. She is a young dark haired girl. She said she was one of the ladies who talked to me on the phone. I asked her why couldnt I stay in the same room. She looked in the computer and told me that the bathroom in that room is broke. I could'nt believe my ears. I was told that the room was reserved for someone else by other lady at the front desk. I told her how some other lady told me a different story. To this she told me \" Sir, but this is the room you were supposed to be in\". I never heard the word \"sorry\" or \"I apologize\". I told her that it was poor coustomer service that they checked me in a wrong room. She says\" Sir, that was a mistake in writing room number, you are in the room which you belonged in the first place. The other room is not ready for you\" Remind you, me and my wife have been taking upto 3 vacations a year around the world. I have never ever heard that kind of talking from the front desk. I decided not to ruin it for my family and never mentioned anything to my wife.

The pool was nice also. My best advice is to buy the refillable mugs on your first visit to the dining hall. They are $11.99 each but once you buy them all drinks from the self service area are free...water, soda, Hi-C. hot chocolate, coffee, tea and ice tea, this is a great deal and will save you in the long run, they are only good at your dining hall, not in the parks. We bought the hopper passes and usually did 2 parks a day, we also had the pass for the water parks and Wide World of Sports complex so were able to catch a game during spring training. We saw the Braves and Dodgers play, great seats for only $19 each. We were there from Tuesday to Tuesday and really made the most of our time. Try not to hit the Magic Kingdom on Saturday or Sunday..too busy. We used the Magical express from the Orlando airport and it was great, no waiting for your bags, they do it all. Not having a vehicle to go to the store, I shipped myself a box of goodies, bagels, cereal, lots of snacks and we saved a lot by doing this.

I had stayed at Riverside twice previously but decided to give French Quarter a try. Pros: The grounds are beautiful as others have already said. I loved that it connected to Riverside (and their scenic paths) so that I had a great route for my morning runs. (I would highly recommend this resort to runners over the other moderates or budget hotels.) The view from our room (in building 6) was spectacular. Definitely request a river view! We did not pay extra for it because it was not THAT important to us, but upon check-in I requested it and received it. The boat ride to downtown Disney was relaxing and fun. The staff I dealt with were all outstanding from the front desk to the workers in the food court and store. I liked the smaller size of the French Quarter over Riverside. Things were definitely not as long of a walk after a long day in the sun! Cons: I really do not have many complaints. The only reason I gave this hotel a 4 instead of a 5 was the fact that our jack for the high-speed internet was broken. They did come and fix it for us on day 3 but wired it from the opposite side of the table so we had a LONG wire across our room. The food court was also very crowded due to the food court at Riverside being closed, but I think this will only be a few more weeks.

We decided on this middle range hotel because we knew the cheaper ones would be over run with hundreds of people, therefore longer queues for buses etc and unfortunately we couldn't afford the more expensive ones (which we did notice, also had longer queues for buses!). This hotel was quaint, very quiet (especially the rooms which we found were incredibly sound proofed as I never heard anyone in any other rooms). I was amazed every morning when I stepped outside the door and heard........nothing, just bird song. We were literally steps away from the river. The rooms were exactly as pictured in the brochure and were spotless. We were also very pleased to see towel animals, shapes etc nearly every day when we came back from the parks. They even positioned some of my son's soft toys into little scenes on the bed. The first week of our holiday the food court was fairly quiet and the added convenience of the flasks that you top up as you need drinks was great. I must admit it did get busier the second week, but as I understand it, not only was it the week the children have off in England, but also it was leading up to Presidents week, hence the weekend was really busy. We did, however, always manage to get a table. The food was good and there was quiet a variety of dishes and there was even grapes, celery and carrot sticks which are my son's favourite. The hotel grounds and hotel were always spotless and the staff went out of their way to be chatty, friendly and helpful. They couldn't do enough for you. The availability of transport was also great. We were the first pick up and drop off from Port Orleans. If the bus was full, it skipped Riverside entirely. I only had to stand up once in the my whole 2 week stay. I can also recommend the boat trip to Down Town Disney. My son was made second in command on one trip and was given a badge to prove it. He loved all the attention he got from all members of staff whenever we went out. It was really magical for him. He also loved the swimming pool. We had a job stopping him going on the slide as he loved it so much. He is only 3 1/2 but they provide floatation equipment so he was able to swim and play as much as he liked. The lifeguards were so vigilant. There were several and 2 were on high seats overlooking the pool and at least another 2 constantly walked around looking in the pool, just in case. We felt very secure. My son even got a toy and certificate from one of them for being the first to use the pool slide that day. I cannot praise this hotel enough, even the bell boys were helpful and funny when they kept my son amused while we were waiting for our transportation to the airport. We will definitely, money permitting, be back again and would definitely choose this hotel as they really made us feel at home. I know there have been just a couple of bad reports from some people about this hotel, but feel that they must have just been unlucky and feel sorry that their experience was ruined.

It's especially relaxing if you have been running around Downtown Disney with the kids.

We had asked for a room near the lobby and got one in the building closest to the lobby. Although the French Quarter is the smallest of the moderate Disney hotels, it is still huge and is spread out over a large area. I would hate to be in one of the farthest away building. There are 7 buildings, each with 3 floors and elevators. I still can't get over how quiet the room was. In one week, I never heard one footstep, heard a toilet flush, water running ,overheard anything from our neighbours. And I know the rooms were occupied as I saw children coming and going from the neighbouring rooms. The bed was among the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel (and I have stayed at a lot of hotels). The only thing that would make the beds better is if they were queen sized beds. The room was large, so I don't know why Disney insists on double beds in the rooms when queen beds would be better. I really loved the double sinks in the curtained off area. In a tour book, I had read that each room had a fridge. I phoned the hotel directly to see if this was correct. I was told that there were no fridges in the rooms but I could order one and pay 12 dollars a night. There was a minibar fridge in our room. I checked with several other people who were staying at the hotel and they all had fridges, so I have no idea why I was told that there were no fridges in the rooms. All I can think of is that I asked about a fridge and not a minibar fridge. But surely they would have known what it was I wanted. Whatever, we made good use of the fridge. The first night I bought some half pint cartons of milk in the food court for 1.29 each. Then the second day I discovered that in the giftshop they sold some food and drinks. A quart of milk was only 1.75. And if you happened to be in the Riverside hotel for a meal (the sister property) , you could buy a half gallon of milk for 2.25. We used the bus transportation system each day. No need for a car at all. We never waited longer than 5 minutes for a bus to take us to any of the parks. And when coming home, the longest wait was 10 minutes. It seems as if they have the timing of buses down pat. They know exactly when people will be wanting to go to the parks and home again and they send multiple buses to the locations. I had read that buses went to French Quarter first then to Riverside, but we only did that once and that was in the middle of the day. Other times we went directly to the parks from our lot. Going home the buses went to both places, but we always got off first, so who cared. We got a seat on the bus about half the time. But we could easily have waited the 5 mintues or so til the next bus if we hadn't wanted to stand. And it was never more than a 12 minute ride on the bus. I did find the food court to be crowded in the evenings. Lots of seats to sit at, but waits to get your food at each of the stalls. And not enough cashiers. Good thing they had a microwave to reheat the food as it was sometimes cold by the time we got to the table. The only thing not up to Disney's standards was the housekeeping. Yes, we did get fresh towels each day, but the dusting and vacuuming was not as good as many hotels. But who cares, I certainly don't dust and vacuum at home each day!!! I absolutely loved the hotel and the location and when I go back to WDW, I will absolutely stay at this hotel again. I confess to liking the atmosphere and decor at the Riverside better than at the French Quarter, but that hotel is just SO spread out. I can see it taking 20 minutes to get to the lobby/dining rooms if you aren't lucky with your room assignment. We did take the ferry to the Riverside and also to Downtown Disney and I would recommend that to everyone. It was scenic and a nice experience.

The food court staff goes out of their way to hand out beads to the kids (and adults) and the cook came out and did some magic coin stuff with my 4 year old. He loved it! I highly recommend getting at least 1 refillable mug. We got our money's worth out of this mug. The food is pretty good and there is a good selection. The bakery has delicious treats. I really didn't think the prices were bad at all. My family of 3 ate for around $20-25 each meal. Kids meals are $3.99 and include 2 sides and a drink. It has one bus stop and is the first to pick you up and drop you off. You are guaranteed a seat - we never had to stand. You can purchase theme park tickets at the concierge, and they really need more workers to jump in and help, especially when one family takes 20 minutes selecting dining plan meals with the only worker. Lots of people got frustrated by this and left. The boat ride to Downtown Disney makes for a great, free thing to do in the afternoon or evening. We really enjoyed this and did it several times. The hotel offers a carriage ride around the resort at nighttime for about $35. The only bad thing is that you have to go to Riverside to board. The rooms are pretty quiet. We were on the 1st floor (which i recommend you request since they don't have elevators to carry up your luggage), and we were the room closest to the food court. We didn't hear anything. It's a nice quiet hotel. Housekeeping did a good job - though we were hoping for some of those animals that they make out of towels and washcloths. Though we didn't swim, the pool looked awesome. Great theme and slides for the kids. We'll have to go back where it's warmer. I would definitely stay here again.

We picked the FQ because of its reviews on TripAdvisor as being one of the better hotels on the Disney property as well as being small and relatively adult-oriented. We were both impressed by the property. The resort was well laid out, with small courtyards and paths. We were in building 7 which is one of the farthest from the main building but was about a five minute walk. The resort was generally quiet, however we did notice people smoking on the exterior corridors in the evening and their conversations carried quite a distance mainly due to the quietness overall. The inter-room noise insulation was very good. As reported on here the rooms were nice for a mid-level resort, two sinks, mini-fridge and a table to sit at, everything was clean and tidy. My single complaint would be the housekeeping which seemed hit or miss. One day everything was great, next day the sheets on the bed were not tucked in and the bed was barely \"made\", but then next day everything was great again. The check-in service was a bit on the slow-side but that was mainly due, I think, to getting people familiarized with their many options (dining plan, theme park tickets, location of restaurants etc). As noted on TA before - there is no table service restaurant at the FQ which didn't bother us as we had made advance reservations to eat at the various parks, however if you would like one you could walk to the Port Orleans Riverside which is probably a 10 minute walk away from most of the buildings in the FQ. The Disney transportation was good. Do not underestimate the benefit of only having one bus stop for the FQ. I can see this saving considerable time over a situation where there are multiple stops in a resort. It appears that sometimes the bus that picks up the FQ people goes to Riverside but only in the slower periods (i.e. middle of the day). First thing in the morning our bus to the Magic Kingdom and the Animal Kingdom went directly to the parks after just the FQ stop. Our bus to MGM went there after stopping at one Riverside stop but not the others, so it seems a bit random. In the evening, being the first stop to be dropped off is worth its weight in gold as tired feet and cranky kids don't want to spend an extra 10 minutes on the bus. The location of FQ was a big attraction as well. In the evening after eating dinner at EPCOT the actual ride from EPCOT to the FQ was about 7 minutes long. In the morning it took about 10-15 minutes to reach the Magic Kingdom and about 20 to reach the Animal Kingdom. The FQ's central location coupled with it being first in the \"Port Orleans\" pick-up/drop-off rotation would be enough for me to suggest to anyone to pick the FQ over the Riverside. The conceierge service was good with a couple of helpful staffers getting us reservations for lunch and helping us check in for our flight home (for free - including printing out our boarding passes, I have stayed at many 5-star business hotels which charge for that). I gave the FQ 4-stars, but I would have given it a 4.5 if I could. It was better than I expected for a Disney resort and I would absolutely recommend it to others. The resons why I didn't give it 5-stars would be the hit and miss housekeeping, lack of table service restaurant and the sometimes sharing of a bus with Riverside.

We saw a large water spill on the floor the length of five tables at the food court that took thrity minutes until a staff member cleaned it up. Unfortunately, the parks weren't much better -- three instances where cast members were not wearing their own name tags; a food spill at Epcot that was never cleaned up; dirty trays and plates stacked high by servers on wastebaskets at Wolfgang Puck's at Downtown Disney that ended up toppling over -- fortunately, not onto anyone; food service at Pinocchio's Village Haus at Fantasyland that should have taken three minutes, but took ten to receive part of the order and twenty-five minutes to receive the remainder, with the manager's simple apology that they were trying to shut down one of the kitchens, and having one in our party have diarrhea from her meal at that restaurant (as a result, she was not permitted to board the Disney cruise the next day -- the representative would not accept our claim about trip interruption insurance, but only offered park visit or a credit toward another cruise -- the Disney bus driver broke one of our bags in full view of other Disney representatives, but Disney will not pay for the damage; and Disney lost one of our bags, finding it after nine days despite handling our bags for all transfers.) Our family is comprised of true Disney fans, and it is difficult for us to write this kind of review, even in a summary format. We are still amazed that all of this happened to us, but it did. At this point, we cannot recommend Disney World for a vacation to anyone.", "Date": "February 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFrench Quarter - The way we see it\u201d", "Author": "65bus", "ReviewID": "UR6725442", "Content": "We were staying at the French Quarter hotel with the majority of our guests as we were getting married at WDW. Our initial reaction to the hotel was ok, that is until we got to our room and we were blown away! Room: King bed room We loved the room, it was large, had 2 sinks and was very distinctivly decorated. The bed was comfortable and there were about 5 pillows to pick from, it seemed as though they were of a different consistency so we could each find one that suited us, though I may be wrong about that. Showers were always hot and had consistent pressure. The toilets work with a pressurized tank so they are pretty loud and can be a bit of a disturbance when you go for a late night tinkle. But with the pressurized tank there is never anything left in the bowl, so thats good. Staff: The front house staff were friendly, though at times seemed a bit confused. The Maids were awesome, our room was always cleaned well and because we were getting married there and the dress was hanging in the room our maid surprised us every day with a different towel creation. These creations ranged from swans to hearts to a basket of flowers and even a bride. I will try to attach photos of some of these later. Restaurant: Cafeteria style and we usually only had breakfast there, we went to Downtown disney or off the grounds for dinner. Food was good and as pointed out in other reviews, purchasing the refillable cup is a good deal and we used it quite often. Staff were very friendly and even sang songs to people. Pool: I enjoyed the hot tub which though I like my hot tubs a bit hotter was pretty nice. The pool is newly renovated is absolutly a site to see. I can see kids absolutly loving it. Transportation: There is a river boats you can take to either Downtown disney or the riverside resort. These are free and nice way to get around rather than bussing it. The only problem we ran into was at peak hours the boats would arrive from Riverside and they would be too full to carry the waiting passengers. When we travelled as a group of 8 it took about 3 boats before we had one with space. But overall, this service was unique and is pretty much exclusive for the New Orleans resorts. Some of the boat operators talk and tell you abit about the place, while others are more focussed on the river ahead. Most of our guests took the busses to the parks and the service was pretty good. Overall this resort is nice for families and is probably one of the best for adults due to its accessability to Downtown Disney.

I thought I was crazy after I booked a Disney Vacation with a 3 year old, but I would do it again in a second. Besides my child being an exceptional kid (atleast to me) this was a flawless vacation thanks to the Disney touch. We even managed to relax a bit. In the past we have stayed at the all-star resorts but those were my lean years, so I thought I would upgrade to a moderate resort. I honestly didn't see much of a difference. The only negative I would share about the Port Orleans French Quarter was that the food was awful and the food service was slow and not helpful, although I did over hear them making special arrangements for a guest with special dietary needs, which impressed me. But I found the service slow, disorganized and the quality of the food to be poor. But its Disney you aren't there for the food. Staff (other than cafeteria staff) was friendly and helpful. Property is nice, but the all-star properties are nice too. This one has a river and a river boat which was always full since it stopped at the Riverside resort first and the one time we took the boat we had to wait 25 min. for one that wasn't too full, although they come by every 10 min. after 4pm. The theme parks were all great, even though they were very crowded due to the three day weekend, we managed to do everything we wanted to do. Soarin' was hyped up and was a bit of a disappointment, but Test Track and Tower of Terror (at MGM) were amazing. My son (3) was mostly interested in the character meet and greets and the character were all very accomodating and went the extra mile ( I know they often get a bad rap, especially tigger) my heart was warmed when I saw characters and staff members go out of their way for a make a wish child who was waiting in line to see Woody from Toy Story, they didn't have to do anything special except be themselves but you can tell that they really took pleasure in making this kids and his family feel very special it was a wonderful thing to witness.

We were there from 1/2/07 - 1/9/07. My wife and I stayed POFQ and our family were at Saratoga Springs. We all had an excellent time and the weather was unseasonably warm which was great. We have vacationed at WDW approximately 15 times over the past 30 years and have stayed at ; Fort Wilderness Trailers/Cabins,Caribbean Beach, PO Riverside (when it was Dixie Landings , and the All Star Resorts. We have only stayed off property once and that was our initial visit. The hospitality at POFQ is what keeps them a notch above the other \"moderate resorts\" at WDW. Any questions we had and any needs we had were satisfied by the staff. Check-in and check-out were quick and painless. Another aspect , about the POFQ, we like very much is; accessability; it is very easy to get around. My guess is you can be to the lobby area in no more than seven minutes from any point on the resort. The resort overall and the rooms are very quiet. We never heard a neighbor the entire time. Obviously the rooms are well insulated and sound proofed. The food at the food court is good. We were on the meal plan and it worked out for the two of us. We did dine at various table service restaurants and our favourite was Le Cellier with Capt. Jack's a close second. Our least favourite table service was Hollywood and Vine with Mexico,Boatwright's falling in between. The parks were crowded due to the Disney Marathon Weekend and as a result the transportation was average at best. We waited at MK , mid-day, for 35 minutes for a bus back to POFQ. Leaving the parks mid-day or early evening were the worst times for making bus connections. Of course, at closing there were plenty of buses. My sense is; Disney has a lot of part-time drivers with more shifts at the beginning and end of each day. I would have to say the transportation was the low point of our stay. The longest lines to get into the park was definitely Epcot. They will have to get their act together and hire more security screeners. The best entry was MGM. We did stay on extended hours at the MK Monday evening and it was not worth it because many attractions were closed but MANY stores were open. HMMMM!! Would we return to WDW ? Yes .

We really loved it! My husband and I are 36, and34, and our children are 9 and 6. We are both pharmacists, and typically stay in Hilton level resorts. We have been to the Disney area every year for the last 6 years with friends without the kids, or some combination of the kids, but, we have never before stayed on Disney property. We thought we'd try this year for that whole Disney experience. We stayed on property, bought the meal plan, we were all in. We were a little leary, as we stayed in condos, and went to Universal as well the other years. We were afraid we the benefits of staying on property in a regular hotel room wouldn't outweigh the benefits of the extra space, freedom, etc. of staying in a condo. Because we couldn't give that all up entirely we rented a car. We were glad to have the extra added freedom, but, we really, truly didn't need it. We won't rent a car if we go again if we plan to stay only at Disney. Port Orleans: This resort had come highly recommended by friends, and was recommended over the Riverside because there are some real benefits. The French Quarter is much smaller (we were told it only has ~1000 rooms), therefore very quaint and homey feeling, and even though we were fairly far away from the lobby it was only a 5 min. walk. Because it's smaller, there always seemed to be room on the buses. In addition, the entire time we were there the French Quarter had a bus all to itself to and from the Magic Kingdom, which almost made it worth it on its own. When you think of parking, tramming to the transportation center, then taking a ferry or monorail and finally getting there, whew! It was great! Also, the Riverside bus stop was right next to the FQ at MK and there were always tons of people waiting there and maybe a dozen or two at ours. We only ended up standing a few times, and even then the kids stood and it wasn't a big deal. It's only a few minutes and FQ always drops off first from all the parks that do make the Port Orleans share a bus. The hotel rooms were very nice, clean, with a ceiling fan, and nice vanity area outside the very tiny bathroom. The housekeeping was nice and left the animals, etc. as read about in other reviews. After all you see, it sounds ridiculous, but, the kids loved coming back to the room to see what was left. They also loved the pool, and there was plenty of room, chairs, etc. The gift shop was very nice. We used the service at the parks of having souvenirs sent directly to the resort, what a great perk, not having to lug things around the park. Food plan: If you're like us and looking for the catch, there really isn't any. There is, however, more food than you will ever be able to eat. Know ahead of time that you can share meals. Once you realize that the lunches come with a large drink (where offered) and a dessert, they are even more easily split among 4 people, and then you have breakfast everyday as you can share that as well. We ate like kings, at the Crystal Palace, Liberty Tree Tavern, Wolfgang Pucks at Downtown Disney, Planet Hollywood, Coral Reef, really amazing. We didn't have a dinner that would have cost less than $100. So, we figured we easily made it worthwile on dinner alone. You could also save a couple dinners and combine them to go to a show, such as Hoop Dee Doo, or Cinderella's royal table. Now, for the snacks. Because we didn't realize we could share right away, or what that could do for us, we made a trip to the grocery store the first night for breakfast fare for the room. However, in the gift shop, there are bags of bagels and full size bags of chips, etc. that count as 1 snack credit. Be creative with your snacks! We still left at the end of the 8 days with snacks and counter service meals left. GET IT, you won't be disappointed. Make all your dinner reservations early. months early if possible. Try to coordinate with the early/late magic hours. I tried 8 weeks ahead this year and still couldn't get into Cinderellas table, and couldn't get into the sci fi drive in at MGM on late night there, which by the way was absolutely fantastic as well. The early/late hours, of course, are the best of all. There aren't even words. There was not a moment of regret, and the FQ was great, don't hesitate!", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, NC", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "charlottehokie00", "ReviewID": "UR6122050", "Content": "I have been to Disney World on three times over twenty years and have always stayed outside the parks. I was hesitant to pay the extra money to stay on site, but my wife talked me into it. We decided to pay for a moderate hotel over the value ones, in hopes of avoiding the noise of children. We also read multiple reviews on various sites and they all stated that the smaller size of this resort made the stay here so much better. We were given a room on the third floor of building seven and I can honestly say this is one of the quietest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. A huge selling point and not what I have come to expect as of late. I was thrilled by just how quiet and undisturbed we were. We were in building seven which was far from the lobby, but not worth complaining about. Its probably one reason it was so quiet. The room was clean and larger than I was guessing. I liked the curtain that you could pull to seperate the sink area from the bedroom. This was nice when I woke first and didn't want to disturb my wife. Everything was spotless and we had no complaints. The resort is beautiful and nice and we were amazed just how safe you felt no matter what the time of night. That's something you can't say if you stay off the Disney grounds. The transportation was great and we only used the car to drive to other resorts for dinner or to see SeaWorld or Universal. The cafe on site is good for breakfast, but pretty bad for lunch/dinner. We did enjoy milkshakes and fresh fruit which were nice changes, but avoid the pizza. We ate all our lunches and dinners at parks and other resorts, but one because we were on the dining plan. We would certainly stay here again. The only reason we would stay somewhere else is to experience a different theme.

My husband, self and 2 year old had a good time. Our room was in building 4-which was great as it was close to the pool, foodcourt and bus stop! Excellent didn't have to walk far for anyone. Our room had 2 double beds-which worked well for my 2 year old and they even gave us a bed rail which was awesome as neither myself or husband had to sleep with her so she wouldn't roll out of bed, but my husband and I found that the bed was tight for the 2 of us. The room was comfy-nothing special. Housekeeping did come everday and supplied us with clean towels and made our beds-but other than that nothing much else was done. The tub wall tiles needed a bit of scrubbing-as mildew was starting to appear and our floor could have used some vaccumming as our 2 year old had spilled some goldfish on the floor and had crushed it into the carpet. This occured at the start of our trip and it was still there the day we left! Housekeeping was very friendly and did leave our 2 year old a towel doll and duck on our 2 last nights! Food: overall ok nothing gourmet. Typical fast food, quick lines. RECOMMEND the resort mugs for $11 free refills that was great! Pool: GREAT- We were only in the kiddie pool but the large pool looked just as good and alot of people seemed to enjoy it. Also there is a great playground next to the pool for kids. My 2 year old had a blast! And for us older adults a Hot Tub-it was great!! Transportation: Buses are GREAT!! Never had to wait longer than 5 mins. Only Complaint is that some drivers don't know which buses come and go from different resorts. They should be a bit more knowledgable in that aspect. Also a + French Quarter is always picked up first for the parks and dropped off first as well GREAT when u have kids! Ohh and also if u are coming back to the hotel at night from a park with small kids pack a coat. The Buses are very COLD!! The have the Air Conditioner Pumping and it gets very cold Also note, during the night the resort does most of its maintance so u will hear blowers and trucks coming and going and backing up.

The bus system was great. We had no long waits coming or going to the parks. It was nice to not have to drive for the week. The food was mediocre, but always very fresh, large portions and served by happy cast members. The food court was never too busy or loud, and it was never messy or dirty in our experience. The pools were wonderful for our kids (3 and 5). They loved the slide, but older kids might be looking for something more thrilling. The most activity we saw in the pool was late at night, and it could be quite loud. I wouldn't stay near the pool. The laundry facility was clean and the machines were in good working order. It was $2 to wash, $2 to dry. There is a retractable clothes line in the bathroom, but I found it took a really long time for things to air dry. Overall, POFQ was an excellent place for us to stay.

I chose the hotel based on previous reviews on the hotel and I was not disappointed. It was much smaller than other disney resorts which made queues and services much better. We arrived earlier than recommended and they checked us in straight away and organised transport back to the airport for our return journey at no cost. Staff were really friendly and extremely helpful. The rooms were very clean and were serviced every day. They were a great size and had a fridge, 2 double beds, TV and air conditioning. The bus stops to the parks are a very short walk from any part of the resort and it was also the first pick-up. We never had to wait for any bus for more than 5 minutes. The bus only made one more stop to the hotel's sister resort - Port Orleans Riverside. On returning from the parks we were also the first to be dropped off. There is also a great boat that takes you staight to downtown disney (the staff that run these are great - they give you loads of info - and even told us that there is going to be a NEW PARK especially suited to teenagers/adults!!) The pool at the hotel was great and had a towel service. The hotel seemed to be slightly more grown up than other resorts. It was also incredibly clean and the grounds were very well maintained with lots of wildlife. The restaurant was a bit like a canteen but was extremely reasonable - around $5 each for breakfast and about $10 each for lunch/dinner. There was much more variety than the parks and downtown disney restaurants (and in some cases much better food - we paid $70 in Planet Hollywood and the food was BAD and the bill was on the table before we finished our main course). Top Tips: 1. Buy a refill mug - $11 and refill as much as you like at the resort. 2. If you want to eat in downtown disney, try to book! (the resort staff give you a booklet with all numbers in it and to ring is free). If you want to eat in the Rainforest Cafe - BOOK!! There is a 2 hour wait time even in October (the Rainforest Cafe at Animal Kingdom is much better however). 3. If you want a character breakfast, book a couple of weeks in advance. 4. Try House of Blues and Bongos in Downtown Disney - the best meals we had - and the only places that we got vegetables on our plates and didn't sell just burgers and fries. 5. Try booking it through Disney's website - I am from the UK and booked it through their UK website and found this was the cheapest by far Definitely give this hotel a go - I would truly recommend it!!", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cQuality resort for the price\u201d", "Author": "bri11164", "ReviewID": "UR6032946", "Content": "Stayed at Disney at this resort October 7 - October 11, 2006. Was a family trip with my sister, her husband and 2 kids as well as our parents. Hotel is listed by Disney as Moderate resort and cost was approximately $140/night. I last stayed on Disney in 1995 at the Wilderness Lodge which is a Deluxe resort. It's sister hotel is Port Orleans - Riverside which is a 10minute walk away along a canal. Riverside is much bigger in terms of occupancy than French Quarter and has a buffet rest. and an a la carte rest. as well as a good size bar that serves appetizers/snack type fare. Staying at either resort gives you priveleges at both. ROOMS - We had a room with a king bed that was in building 5 directly opposite the Laundromat and just steps from the pool. Room was a decent size with 2 sinks/vanities outside the bathroom. Bathroom itself was small but clean. Bed was comfortable and room came with a min-fridge which was a bonus. PROPERTY - Grounds have French Quarter /Mardi-gras them as does the pool which has it's own waterslide for the kids. There is also a playground for the kids just outside the pool area. Pool area clean with plenty of chairs and 3 lifeguards on duty at all times. There are bathrooms with showers and changing area at the pool for those who can't get a late check out but want to enjoy the pool on get-a-way day. There is also a pool bar that serves just about everything and has 2 TV's for viewing. It did not serve food. They also have a gift/convenience store which in addition to souvenirs sold beer/wine/alcohol various snacks and sundries. FOOD - There is only 1 restaurant which is a buffet and appeared to be open 24 hours. Food was average. Geared mostly toward families with kids so there were many different types of food to choose from. Service a little slow but given their are over 1000 rooms most with families in them it is understandable. The have small bar next to restaurant which has all your favorite drinks, 2 TV's and entertainment on certain nights...open until about 1am. You can also eat at sister hotel Port Orleans - Riverside. They have a much bigger buffet area restaurant as well as an a la carte restaurant. Also, they have over 2000 rooms so plan accordingly. SERVICE - except for the restaurant service was prompt and with a smile. TRANSPORTATION - Buses pick you up right outside front of hotel for all parks. Behind the pool is a water shuttle that takes you to the Riverside hotel or to Downtown Disney (approx 15 min ride). Never had to wait more than 10 min for a bus and on one occasion where there were more people waiting for a particular bus than could be accomodated the driver called in for a second bus which arrived within minutes of the first bus.

The French Quarter was beautifully themed with spacious open areas, and a river running along the length of it. We did our homework before we went and requested a room in building 5 (no smoking block next to the pool) facing either the river or the gardens (I pointed out that I wanted a quiet room and did not want to face the pool area, but wanted to be near it for the children). We were allocated exactly what I asked for! We were even placed an equal distance between stairways and escalaters and so there was minimal foot traffic in front of the room. I was delighted with the room location and the cleanliness on arrival. The hotel was small and quiet and everywhere was easily accessible. This hotel is the smallest moderate resort. Unlike an earlier review, we found the pool area to be quiet when we were there and the children loved an afternoon swim before returning to the parks. When we returned in the evening the pool area was a little more busy and noisy (not overly so), and I was pleased to walk around block 5 to the tranquility of the garden area. We used the foodcourt for breakfast every morning and we easily found a table and never had to wait long for a good breakfast. I found the food prices to be very reasonable - childrens breakfast with a drink only cost ~\u00a32.50. The maid service was good and we received 3 towel animals during our 2 week stay, which the children were excited about. Beds were changed every three or four days, and there were always plenty of fresh towels. We had cause to contact maintenance twice during our stay: One morning the toilet wouldn't flush, and when we arrived back from the park it had been repaired; and one evening we couldn't find our remote for the TV (I think the maid had collected it up when stripping the beds) and someone arrived with a new one in ~15 minutes - Excellent! The buses to and from the parks were excellent, we never waited long for one in either direction. I adore Disney and this hotel was perfect for our needs, I hope that we will return! Hotels that we have stayed at previously: Disney's All star movies - very good for the money, but a little hectic and so we decided to spend a little more the following years. Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort - Beautiful, but too spread out for us. We were in a building a long way from the amenities.

Once home I can say I defiantly made the right decision staying here for 11 nights. The other resorts seemed spaced over a wide area compared to the compact POR-FQ. Disney Magical Express \u2013 After landing at Orlando airport the Disney check in was difficult to find despite the location information on the booklet. Once found everything went very smoothly and within an hour of landing was at the reception desk checking in. My baggage however took over 3 hours to appear but I was informed this was due to 3 vans of baggage arriving at the same time when I phoned the concierge desk to enquire. When it was time to leave the bus returned me to the airport in plenty of time to catch my flight home. Check In \u2013 I had booked through the UK Disney web site. When I presented the various vouchers for the accommodation and park pass I was sent the cast member (Doc) informed me there was a problem as the UK Disney site is not compatible to the main Disney system. Why? He went away returning from time to time to keep me informed and after 20 minutes managed to get everything sorted and handed me my room card and information pack. The room card is also you park pass and you can charge everything you buy to it at the parks and have it delivered to your room. Room \u2013 I was in building 5 on the top floor in a non-smoking room as requested which was only 60 seconds from the food hall, concierge desk, gift-shop and 90 seconds from the bus stop. The room was very comfortable with 2 double beds, fridge, coffee maker, in-room safe and plenty of storage space. The toilet flush is rather loud as is the a/c unit but you get used to it. I was never disturbed by any noise expect for the a/c unit the whole time. It was cleaned every day but I noticed that the top shelves had a thick layer of dust which I removed with some damp tissues when I arrived. One day I was left a towel bunny which I appreciated. Food Hall \u2013 The food was freshly prepared when you ordered it and was fine but the options are limited and never change. I bought the refillable mug which re-paid itself several times over as advised. The queues at the register were always short even at the busiest times. Disney Transportation \u2013 I never waited more than 5-10 minutes for buses to any of the parks or downtown Disney. As mentioned before the buses expect for downtown Disney stop here first before going onto Riverside which has 4 stops unlike FQ which only has one so you always found a seat. The buses were clean and comfortable and the drivers informed you where to catch the return bus at each park and other information about the park. Sometimes the noise of understandably excited children and people talking made these announcements impossible to hear. After the firework shows at each park there were plenty of buses waiting so you never had to wait more than 5 minutes. You can also catch a ferry to downtown Disney which starts after 11:00am and to the Riverside resort which are worth well catching. Concierge Desk \u2013 I wanted to go to Sea World and Universal Studios and thought I be thrown out for asking but I was wrong. The staff were again very helpful and friendly and advised me to book a shuttle which costs $15 return and you can specify the pick up and return times to suit your day. They were very happy to do this for me and it\u2019s best to arrange this the day before you want to go. I was also able to ex-changed my travellers cheques here. Resort \u2013 The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. I never used the pool which seemed popular going by the noise coming from it when I walked pass. The hot tub looked inviting but again I never used it. All the staff are friendly and approachable and seem to go that bit extra to make your stay enjoyable. The Riverside resort is only a 10 minute walk away along the river bank and you can catch the ferry to return.

It was my husband\u2019s 1st trip to DW and my 2nd. It was our first experience at a Disney resort and we are very glad that the Coronado was full and we ended up in Disney\u2019s version of New Orleans. This hotel has a cozy and laid back feel to it (I dare say romantic with its cobblestone roads and old-style streetlights and fountains!) and the sound of the horse drawn carriage making its way around the resort is a nice touch. Check-in was quick and easy: we were able to get our room early and received the king room we had requested. Housekeeping was great in our experience with lots of towels, toiletries, and even towel sculptures. Tips on room location: It is important to mention that this resort is tiny compared to the other moderates so no matter what building you are given, you will be able to get to and from all locations in minutes. Buildings 2 and 5 are closest to the pool, but we were glad to be in #4, which was a bit further from the noise (nice when you need a mid-day nap!). Our king room (which are corner rooms with more windows) was quite big for just the 2 of us. We left our curtains open most of the time since we were on the 2nd floor (very private). There is an elevator in each building as well as a vending and ice machine on every floor. Highlights of the resort: 1- taking the ferryboat to Downtown Disney for dinner (a few times!). The captains are usually funny and informative. 2- using the hot tub every night to soak our sore muscles made for good conversations with other adults. This area is separate from the pool and is very private. 3- staff at Front Desk was always friendly and helpful in arranging dinner reservations, water park tickets, etc. 4 Great pool with many chairs and available towels: do order a Mardi Grog at the pool bar! Drawbacks: 1- no table service restaurant. We only ate breakfasts at the counter service restaurant, which tend to get boring after a week but you must try the beignets (my favorite!). 2- the store is a little small with less choice than Riverside\u2019s. I didn\u2019t find a FQ souvenir that I liked enough to bring home :( One last note: the bus transportation is a great way to get around DW hassle-free but even if FQ boards and debarks before its sister report Riverside, the busses do get crowded.

I had brought a pack and play for my son for his naps and forgot to bring a blanket and sheet for it, but the hotel provided us a fitted sheet and we got it immedialtey after calling to request one. On the last day of our stay we were wanting to go swimming before we left so that the kids could use up some energy before we started our drive back to Texas, I called the front desk and requested a late check out of 1:00, which they gave us so we were able to enjoy the pool for a couple of hours before we left. We had a great room, view and experience at this hotel and with 2 little ones, I am all about ease of travel. We really had a great experience at this hotel and I highly recommend this hotel and this room especially for people travelling with little ones.", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cWho's going to stop going to Disney?\u201d", "Author": "nfsrocks", "ReviewID": "UR5778929", "Content": "We are Floridians local to the area and went to experience my birthday and a small family weekend getaway. Needless to say, we chose Disney, knowing there wouldn't be a disappointment. Well, I was partly right. Booking the reservation was fine over the phone directly contacting DIsney, we got the best rate. The best time to go to Orlando is September, so the rates you can't beat, especially at Disney. Anyway, we arrived on my birthday and checked in. The landscaping and outside was everything you can imagine from Disney- picturesque. Upon check-in we were given 2 rooms that I had booked adjoining each other. We were not offered bell service so we lugged our luggage and our infant to our rooms. When we went inside, the room was filled with smoke, my infant picked up a sharp pin off the floor and was holding it in her hand. It smelled so bad, I called to have our rooms switched. By the way, they don't guarantee that you will get a non-smoking room. The beds were so small that only one person can fit on them. At least most other hotels have double queen beds in them. These were full-size --- SMALL! I finally was able to get another room, on the other side of the hotel and the 2nd room was not adjoining b/c they didn't have it available. I figured I would look.... Lugged our stuff all the way to the other end of the property and the rooms were not close. I peeked into the room adjoining our room and it was EMPTY! So, again I called the front desk to see if I could get the adjoining room instead of the one around the corner and got a rude operator who told me \"obviously it's booked otherwise we would have given it to you\". Went on to talk with the front desk and after 10 minutes, she was able to tell me that the room WAS available and we can go back to the desk to get some keys. Well, they don't go above and beyond for you, that's for sure. Talked with the manager at the front desk and he basically told us \"we don't guarantee anything\". I guess if you don't promise anything, you cannot disappoint. Service throughout the hotel was the same---Nothing very special at all. Looked like we were at Disney, but didn't feel it. From the bartenders, to servers, to front desk, management, etc. NOTHING. The boat trips they provide to downtown disney is nice and a convenient item. They also allow access to the Riverside property, which seemed much nicer. Except for the pools are old and run-down and have green algae in them. Not very well kept up. Breakfast at the Riverside was great and so was the service. But that is about the only place. There is so much to choose from at Disney and anywhere else, I would take my business elsewhere. But, in all honesty, who is going to stop going to Disney? Overall, not the impression we were looking for, especially since Disney prides themselves on service.

We had read reviews of loud noises, and toilets flushing...we never experienced any of that. We were in Building #3. We were just a short walk from the food court, pool, and bus stop. The room was very clean, and was attended to everyday by the housekeeping staff. We did leave a few dollars for the maid everyday, and she did get us extra pillows when we left a note for her. The beds were very comfortable as well. The food court at the resort was very nice. We enjoyed breakfast everyday there, and one lunch meal there. There is plenty to pick from, and you would not go hungry! We really enjoyed visiting with ''Etta'' as she prepared our breakfast nearly everyday! What a treat to see someone smile and thank you, and wish you a good day!! We did take the river taxi to Downtown Disney one evening, and really enjoyed a nice meal at Wolf Gang Puck's Cafe. It was relaxing to cruise up and down the river in the evening. The bus service was excellent. We never waited more that 20-25 min for a bus, and always had a seat, as we were the first pick up.

What a great time! We loved Port Orleans French Quarter. we would highly recommend this resort. POFQ is smaller than the other Disney resorts, which was one of the reasons we liked it. We stayed in building #5. We had a wonderful corner room, on the first floor, facing the pool area. Although we were close to the pool and hot tub, we never heard any noise while in our room. The room was terrific! We found the room to be bigger than we expected. It had 2 double beds, which we all found to be very comfortable. (There were 2 adults, one teenager, and one 9 year old.) The bathroom area is separated from the actual sleeping area by a privacy curtain. Our teenage daughter loved having the curtain. It really gave her the privacy she wanted to change, do her hair, etc. The toilet and shower are separate from the double sink area. This allowed someone to shower, and someone else to get ready at the same time. There was a hair dryer, iron and ironing board, refrigerator and safe in the room. They all came in handy! Everything worked great. No problems. The only thing we weren't thrilled with, were the pillows. They were definitely smaller than a standard size pillow. We phoned housekeeping, and within 10 minutes, they brought us 4 extra pillows! We utilized Disney's Magic Express service. We would highly recommend this. We arrived at the airport and went directly to a shuttle (bus) to our hotel. We didn't have to worry about our luggage at all. We arrived at 11AM and our room wasn't ready, so we decided to eat lunch at the food court. The food court offered burgers, fries, mac & cheese, salads, wraps, chicken fingers, hot dogs, pizza, chicken parm, spaghetti and meatballs, desserts, etc. It isn't a gourmet restaurant, but we all enjoyed it. Breakfast at the food court includes Mickey waffles, bacon, sausage, breakfast sandwiches, bagels, scrambled eggs, homefries, pancakes, cereal, fruit, etc. We HIGHLY recommend spending the $11.99 for the refillable mugs. They are well worth the money. And, you have a souvenir when you get home! After lunch, we decided to go swimming in the pool. (Great pool! It has a sea serpent shaped water slide. (Yes, adults use it too!!) We went to the concierge to see if we could check in our carry on luggage so we could use the pool. Without us asking, they phoned the front desk, and then let us know that our room was ready. We were thrilled since they said it would probably be a couple of hours before it would be ready. We went to our room, and our luggage was already there! Great service! We were very happy with the lifeguards in the pool area. There are many of them, and they are constantly walking around, watching everyone in the pool. We definitely felt our youngest daughter was \"Safe\" in the pool. One afternoon, a lifeguard decided to get a group together to play \"Marco Polo\". The children really enjoyed it. We were impressed. The bus service to all of the parks and Downtown Disney was very good. Buses run every few minutes to each of the parks and Downtown Disney from the hotel. We had one negative experience going back to the resort from Downtown Disney. We found the driver to be rude, and generally not in a good mood. (Very rare in Disney, but it does happen.) He didn't drop off at POFQ 1st either. He went to Riverside (POFQ's sister hotel.) 1st. From everything we read, the buses always stop at POFQ 1st. This isn't true. A few times, the buses stopped at Riverside 1st. This is a pain since there are a few different stops at the Riverside resort. The way to go to Downtown Disney is by riverboat. This was relaxing and fun. We highly recommend taking the riverboat. There is a nice boat landing right at POFQ. You can also take the boat over to Riverside. (Or you can walk. Either way is pretty quick, and nice.) You can rent boats at Riverside, and the sea racers. They were a lot of fun. You can also take a horse and carriage ride and rent bicycles. Our daughter got her hair \"wrapped\" at Riverside too. She loved it! (They charge by the inch.) We would HIGHLY recommend utilizing the Disney Dining Plan. It was terrific! There are so many restaurants to choose from and you never have to worry about paying your bill everytime you have a meal. We loved the convenience of it! (Not to mention the food was great!) Our daughter enjoyed collecting all of the Disney pins too. You can start your collection off with a complimentary pin from the resort. Then, you need to purchase a strap to put your pins on. You can buy pins and keep them, or you can trade pins with any Dinsey Castmember. It's fun! The gift shop at POFQ was good too. It had everything from snacks, to personal items, T-shirts, and lots of Disney stuff. It was great. We were able to purchase some last minute Disney souvenirs that we couldn't find in other areas of Disney. We would highly recommend Port Orleans French Quarter Resort!

No long hikes to anywhere. Great pool with a slide. Quiet shaded walkways and courtyards. Just a really pleasant and relaxing place. I stayed here with my 17 year old daughter and 7 year old son for two nights (7/21/06 and 7/22/06) before moving to a studio room at the Boardwalk Villas for five nights as a guest of a Disney Vacation Club member (I bought their timeshare on Ebay-I also posted a review about our BWV stay). My son and I stayed three nights at the Pop Century last August and I found the POFQ to a wonderful relaxing change from the frentic hustle and bustle of the Pop. The rooms at the POFQ are a nice size. Not as cramped as Pop. I brought along a folding cot for my son to sleep on and it fit right next to the bed by the door. At the Pop, you open the door and practically walk into the bed. The room size difference is quite noticeable. A fridge and coffeemaker are standard in the room (unlike the Pop). I really liked the tiled sink area and the two sinks. I also liked the marble shelf behind the tub. The tub at the BWV studio room did not have this feature and I missed it. We could have rented two rooms at POFQ for about the same price that Disney charges for one night at a BWV studio. (POFQ at $155.00 a night and BWV studio at $305.00 a night). Our room and bath were spotlessly clean and our \"mousekeeper\" even put a bag of clean towels and soaps and shampoos in a bag on our door for us the second day because I left the do not disturb sign on the door because we were only there two nights and I didn't feel that we really needed any housekeeping. I have to give kudos to the POFQ Bell Services. I called and requested that are luggage be transfered to the BWV and they promptly sent a nice young man to pick up our luggage. Our luggage arrived at the BWV pronto with no problems. It was a really really nice service. After staying at the Pop and the BWV and the POFQ, I honestly think that the POFQ is one of the best deals for the money at WDW. I think the fact that it is a smaller resort eliminates alot of the negatives that I've read about in reviews of other resorts. Our room was on one end of the resort and we were able to park close to it and to walk to the bus stop and to the pool and the lobby with ease. The bus stop is covered and has seats and a fan (at the Pop you stand in the sun in a really long long line most of the time). I honestly think that the POFQ is one of the coolest (tempature wise in summer) resorts because it has so many shaded areas. The theming is lovely and the brightly painted railings and trim and lovely landscaping really disguise the fact that the resort is just a set of boxy motel buildings. The interior design is also really pleasing in color and decor with nice \"antique\" -looking furniture and attractive framed prints on the walls. I would definitely stay at POFQ again and I would recommend it to anyone staying on Disney property. I would also recommend that anyone thinking about staying at a Disney \"value\" resort rethink their choice and go for a moderate. It is well worth it in my opinion because you have more room, improved transporataion facilities, and more amenities (Pop Century nickles and dimes you to death by charging extra for a room closer to the food court and bus stop and for fridge rental and by not providing a coffee maker, which forces you to bring your own or pay for their coffee).", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cHad a good time at the French Quarter\u201d", "Author": "parkhoppermax", "ReviewID": "UR5616883", "Content": "Stayed at the French quarter from Aug1-8th 2006.

I was expecting the king, non-smoking room I'd requested, and instead received a very obviously smoked-in room with two full beds. Too tired at this point to change, we stuck it out for the remainder of our trip. This was in building two, and we faced the water. I'm not sure if this is a smoking building or not, but it was an ajoining room, so we had to deal with someone else's smoke pouring in through the doorjamb. Like someone else mentioned, the toilets are a bit scary. They flush so hard my hair practically blew in the breeze they created. I had to plug my ears every time I flushed. Aside from this, the towels were in poor shape, indeed; completely fringed with loose threads and un-soft. Towels we used at a La Quinta later in the trip were of higher standards. Be aware that there is no closet--just a few hangers on a bar outside the bathroom. But the most heinous thing to occur was the maid turning off our alarm the third day. I'd left it set for the first two mornings (I'm extremely careful about these things) and I foolishly didn't check it, and we ended up oversleeping two hours and missing the magic hours at Magical Kingdom.

The experience we had at POFQ was really great. We arrived late (around 11:00 PM) but the girl working the check in counter was still very friendly and helpful (as were at least 90% of the other Disney \"cast members\" we interacted with). Upon arriving at our room (in Building 6, 3rd floor) we started unpacking, only to discover that the lock on our daughter's suitcase wouldn't unlock (it looked like a small piece of metal was jammed into it). We called the front desk and they had a maintenance man up to the room in about 10 minutes with a bolt cutter to cut the lock off. Great service! We only visited the pool one night and didn't get to try the water slide as it was closed due to no lifeguard being on duty after ~7:00 PM or so. It was pleasant though; the water was cool even after a ~90* day of Florida sun, and as others have said there were lots of chaise lounges and chairs. Don't bother bringing your room towel, there is a large towel hut by the pool where you can get as many as you need. We didn't use the food court during our stay, except for one late night dessert \"binge\" which was very tasty (have the dessert guy make you an ice cream cookie sandwich...yum!). I can't comment on the other food, but the desserts were very tasty! We brought breakfast bars and ate lunch and dinner in the park...definitely get the Disney Dining Plan when you go! You won't go hungry.... Just be sure to make your reservations in advance. I would highly recommend both the Japanese Teppanyaki restaurant and the 9 Dragons Chinese (both at Epcot World Showcase) sit-down dinners. Other reviewers mentioned the waits for the bus; it can get a bit long sometimes. It is also frustrating when you're trying to get to Epcot and 2 Typhoon Lagoon or Animal Kingdom busses come by first (note: whatever it says on the bus's side display is where it is going, generally no other stops, though some of them do stop in Downtown Disney after dropping off at PO). A word of warning; the beds are double beds (though there are some single king bed rooms available). We ended up trading nights sleeping with our 4 year old daughter so we could have enough room (my wife and I are both over 6'3\"). We didn't get much of the \"towel animal\" cute displays from the housekeeping staff (probably because we were there in \"prime season\" the first week of July), but they did make a little Mickey head out of a towel, a couple washcloths, and coasters. Disney does support an effort to reduce water and detergent waste, so you can hang your towels up on the shower rod if you would like to reuse them. I also left a note requesting more regular coffee (instead of decaf) which was respected (they actually left 3 or 4 regular coffee packets). One final suggestion; bring your own drinks and snacks for eating in your room. I paid $2.50 for a 20oz Coke from the vending machine (even worse than the prices in the parks, though only by 50 cents!) and the chips/candy bars were similarly over-priced.

You could tell they would try extra hard to make things nice. - Front desk/concierge: Read other reviews about disappointing service, but this was definitely NOT the case with our trip. People were GREAT to deal with. I had questions about some phone charges and the girl offered to go through our entire bill and call me back. Was impressed because not only did she get the problem solved, but she definitely went above and beyond my expectations. Everyone was very friendly. - Food: Food court is typical here. They had burgers, hot dogs, pizza, etc. Breakfast was good, lunch and dinner was okay. Don't expect gourmet meals here, remember that it's a food court! One recommendation is to definitely get a souvenir mug. You get free refills at the resort for the duration of your trip. We bought one mug to share, and it was definitely a savings. - Pool: Was definitely popular. Lots of people staying at Riverside seemed to come over in the day to swim in the 'better' pool. Seemed busy, but never super crowded. -Transportation: Buses were great. Always the first to be picked up AND dropped off (double bonus!). Buses came every 5-10 minutes. Never had to wait long, always got a seat on the way there. As for the magical express from the airport, well all I can say is that it was AWESOME!! We were concerned about our luggage making it okay, being as how we were traveling from Canada, but we had absolutely no problems. We put the disney luggage stickers on and then when we got to Orlando, we just hopped on the bus. We checked in at the resort and then went to downtown disney. When we got back to our room later that night, our luggage was waiting in the room for us. Definitely a plus that we didn't have to waste time at the airport waiting for it. - Other comments: Gift shop at the resort was stocked with lots of things you would find at the parks/downtown disney. Good idea is to buy from here, then you don't need to lug packages around all day. Other suggestion is to use the package delivery. You will get your souvenirs within a day or two. Overall, it was an awesome trip and I would definitely recommend this hotel.

No complaints. Our main concern was the noise level of this resort. We stayed at the Pop Century in a room facing the main pool and the noise was unbearable. So when we checked in they had told us we were in building 2 facing the pool. I was a little upset about that and told them that I had requested a room away from the pool. The Cast Member was great and imediately looked for us another room and found a room in building 6 which was very quiet and close to parking, bus stops and the food court. They were very accomedating. The rooms are worn but in good condition. Also the size of the rooms were big enough for a family of four. My family really enjoyed the pool and the slide. We had so much fun. My only complaint is that the food court was smaller the the others and that they didn't have a grab n go but this really isn't too important to our family.

We chose the POFQ after considering not only all the other hotels at Disney but those outside the World as well. We were very happy with our choice. This hotel is small by Disney World standards (only 1,000 rooms) so even when full it never seems too crowded. The theming works so well because not only are the buildings made to look like 19th century New Orleans, they are surrounded by lush landscaping and added details like lamposts,hitching posts,brick walkways and street signs that really provide genuine atmosphere. The rooms are small but contain quality furnishings,excellent beds and extras like refrigerators, coffee makers etc that raise them from glorified motel rooms to something in the Hyatt or Marriott category. I was concerned about the exterior corridiors but it wasn't a problem during our stay. We never heard a peep from any of our neighbors (although the flushing of toilets took some getting used to). If you're concerned about quiet,request a room in Blgs 1 or 7, at either end of the property,to minimize foot traffic. The level of service here is as good as any 4-star hotel I've stayed at,maybe better. Room was clean at check-in and it was kept that way throughout our 6-night stay. The location of this hotel was perfect for us,since we concentrated our efforts on Epcot and MGM, and POFQ is right next to both. Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are only a 5 minute drive. Another plus is if you're driving you can choose a room close to the parking lot and every morning you can be out of your room and in your car in less than 60 seconds. I doubt if that's possible at any other hotel in the World. We bought a package with a 7-day park hopper and the dining plan, which is an outstanding deal if you're planning on eating most of your meals inside the parks. The room alone cost about $900 for 6 nights,or $150 a night. Not cheap, but a decent value considering the top hotels (Polynesian,Grand Floridian,etc) cost more than twice as much. If you've got the money then by all means stay at one of those. Otherwise,I think the Port Orleans French Quarter is the best choice.

We came in 2004 and stayed in All Star Movies and didn't really enjoy that experience. However we do like the advantages of staying on Disney property ie; transportation, extra magic hours etc. So we thought we would try a moderate resort this time and chose French Quarter. We noticed a difference between the two resorts straight away. All Stars is a glorified \"Butlins\" whereas French Quarter is beautiful. Lovely landscaping, pool and river plus a bar that was great for a quiet drink in the evenings, as my kids just wanted to rlelax in the room watching TV at the end of a busy, hot day in the parks. After our 8 hour flight we arrived at the resort at around 5pm and all the kids wanted to do was get into their swimming costumes and hit the pool. Unfortunately we were informed at check in that the pool was closed for a chlorine \"shock\". We later found out that someone had pooed in the pool! Ok, thats horrible but accidents happen. However it also happened the next day and a few more times during our two week stay. There are signs asking for toddlers to wear training pants in the pool but people must totally disregard this for it to happen so many times. The pool guards have to fish it out with a net and i actually saw one of them heaving!!! The room, we thought was good. A nice size. I think Americans must be used to massive rooms if they think these are small, we found them more than adequate. There was dust and the kids found something plastic under the bed so i don't think they are cleaned to a high standard. I was disapointed that many of the sheets had small holes in them and feel that this is not really acceptable. However the beds were very comfortable but again i was disapointed that after being there for a week our sheets had still not been changed. Despite leaving housekeeping a daily tip we did not enjoy the delights of towel animals etc. More was done for us in this way at the All Stars. I wonder if you get more if you don't leave a tip and the maid is trying harder in anticipation of a good one when you leave. The Food Court! As with All Stars the food is not particularly good but i think it is generally hard to get decent food in Orlando. After two weeks you just want to get home and have a good old roast dinner!!! Fries, fries, fries. Vegetarian like me? Forget it. Hardly catered for at all. Ventured out to the Ponderosa on I Drive. Ordered steak for husband and daughter and kids meal for my son and the buffet for me (as enjoyed on our previous trip) was informed i would have to order a main meal as they do not sell just the buffet. I asked for the vegetarian alternative and they didn't have one! Would make no concessions so i had to order a steak i didn't want just to get the buffet. I would have gone elsewhere but it was late on a Saturday and everywhere was busy. My husband and i enjoyed the food offered in the Scat Cat Bar at the resort. The nachos (i ordered them without the chillibeef) are gorgeous and my husband really liked the chicken wings. The bread and dips just ok. On our last day we had lunch at the House of Blues in Downtown Disney and had a lovely pasta dish followed by Key Lime Pie. This was easily the best meal i had in Orlando. Also ate at Planet Hollywood (below average) Rainforest Cafe (dreadfully expensive) Hard Rock Cafe at Universal (good) Golden Coral (good Value). The parks are wonderful and i love everthing about Disney. Magic Kingdom is Disney personified and i love the parades. Mgm is interesting if you like all the film information. Enjoyed the stunt show and backlot tour. My son loved Rock n roller coaster. Animal Kingdom was my kids least favourite park and we only spent half a day there. In comparison they love Epcot especially Test Track. I loved Soarin. Water parks are great but be careful in Typhoon Lagoon when the big wave comes as the floor is quite rough and my kids suffered nasty grazes whenthey were knocked over. This time we went to Universal and enjoyed both parks. They don't seem as busy and hectic as Disney but also don't quite have the magic either. Spiderman was good but Men In Black was rubbish. Shreck and JImmy Neutron were also great. To sum up we enoyed our stay and would definately stay at the French quarter again. However i would not go in May again as it was way too hot and resulted in us only being able to cope with the parks for a few hours at a time. This holiday is punishing physically at the best of times, but that heat can really finish you off. We travelled with Virgin Holidays and booked their trip to the Everglades and Miami.

Being a family party of 11, we wanted 4 rooms together. We rang the hotel from the U.K. 5 days before leaving, requested block 5 but that was fully booked so were given rooms 2301,2302,2303,2304 in block 2 (top floor). We had read that block 2 was for smokers, but only part of the building was smoking - our rooms were definitely non-smoking and in a super position. We often gathered in the evening outside our rooms and even ate take-away pizza there. Our rooms were a good size (by english standards) and were certainly on a par with a lot of our 4 star hotels. The air conditioning was the worst thing, it was so noisy, there was no way you could sleep with it on, so we used it permanently through the day to keep the room cool and turned it off at night and used the ceiling fan. The hotel itself is immaculate, the gardens beautifully kept - even to the extent that the horses pulling the carriages round \"Riverside\" and \"French Quarter\" in the evenings wear nappy bags!! It was a lovely walk in the evenings beside the river to \"Riverside\", but we seemed to be the only ones doing that. The boat to Downtown was a bonus and made a nice change from using the bus. At busy times though we did have to wait another 10-15 minutes for the next ferry as it picked up at \"Riverside\" first. On the plus side the buses to all the parks pick up here first before going to \"Riverside\" so we were guaranteed a seat. May was a perfect time to go-it was hot 80 -95 deg everyday, only one day of rain and we had booked Gatorland, but it didn't matter - we donned our Mickey Mouse ponchos (all the shops bring them out when it rains) and had a great time. The pool was super - not cold (hotel pools on Mediterranean holidays are much colder) and we usually managed to get sun loungers whatever time we turned up. Unlimited pool towels were another bonus(never a shortage) as were the childrens life jackets although these sometimes did run out. The food court was fine, enough choice for everyone and you can use the food court at \"Riverside\" for a change which has some slightly different choices. The food court was unsophisticated as was the fayre, but the food was all freshly prepared and cooked to order - try the beignets and cookies with mickey mouse sprinkles. On an average don't expect to pay more than $5 (\u00a33) per person for breakfast and $7-$10 (\u00a34-\u00a36) for evening meal(one course). The souvenir mugs at $11.99 saved us a lot of money- we took them with us if we went to the Riverside foodcourt and used them there. Free drinks using the mugs are - tea, coffee, hot chocolate(nice at bedtime), water milk, coke, 7 up, root beer and others.

This time we stayed for 5 nights (June 5-June 9) All in all its a great place, although our first stay 2 yrs. ago (April 2004) went much better. As stated in the review before mine, we will not be going back during a peak season again. The hotel was crowded, as were the parks and buses. Dont plan a summer trip to Disney unless you like high heat and long lines! The hotel is very clean, the rooms are a bit smaller than some but still comfortable. Having a refridgerator in the room was handy. For the most part, the staff is friendly and very helpful with tickets etc... The only complaint I have with the staff was when we checked in. We got a rude, know-it-all named Scott and although I tried to explain our requests, he blew me off and ignored me. After he assigned our rooms, I told him that he was going to have to change them and asked if he would like to listen to what I wanted. He was ticked off, but did what I asked anyway. The last time we stayed there the housekeepers would leave little animals made out of wash cloths and towels on the beds everyday and my daughter who is 6, was really looking forward to them. It was a nice touch... I am assuming that since they were so much busier this time, they didnt have time to do that. The restaraunt is a bit over priced, but so is everything else in Disney. The food selections are pretty standard, although we did get a nice pot roast dinner that was delicious for under $10 one night. The helpings are large and its open late, so when you get back from the parks at night, you can get a snack. Watch them closely when they ring you up...alot of the cashiers are \"in training\" and dont have a clue what they are charging you. We were over charged 3 times. One of the main reasons we like the French Quarter is because you can take a boat ride to and from Downtown Disney right from the hotel. Its really convenient and the boats run about every 15 minutes. Also....the pool is great! Wonderful for the little ones. Alot of fountains and a big sea serpent water slide. It has a kiddie pool as well. There are alot of lounge chairs, although they did fill up quick! We didnt have any problems with the buses to and from the parks, but they were crowded.

For a family with two kids 9 and 5, it was the perfect place to stay. We had a room with a view of the river in building six. The view was lovely, but I will choose a view of the pool next time. If you are planning on swimming, request building number 5 or 4. The grounds were beautifully landscaped with many little rabbits and squirrels running around. The room was clean and beds were comfortable. It was a bit cramped. Overall, the room is very functional. We felt that the room could have used an additional trash can. As you can imagine, we purchased a lot of items that needed to be opened, and we also brought back food to the room which needed to be discarded. The rooms were nice and quiet to our side by side neighbors and outside noise. However, we could hear feet from above. The toilets in these rooms have a tremendous amount of flushing power so we could hear flushing from all directions. Apparantly the pool at our lodge is better than our neighbor's at the Riverside. I met three different guest that were using our pool instead of their own because they felt it was better. The theme is alligators and sea serpents. The pool uses a huge sea serpent as the main piece were his tongue is the slide that drops into water that is 1 meter in depth. There are life guards and towel service at the pool with a pool side bar. The food court is perfect for a childs appetite. Most of the servings choices are carb heavy. The portions are very, very generous. We purchased the meal plan with our package that had a table service, counter service, and snack each day for each person. WE felt like we were full the whole time. There is a small refrigerator in the room so you can take the leftovers back to the room. Plus you can substitute two table service meals for a themed or more formal breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I highly recommend doing some research prior to your trip and taking advantage of some of the better dinning at Disney World. The Disney Transportation is not good, but what can you do. I look at it as air travel with lay-overs. They promote buses every 15-20 minutes, which means you get there and might wait two or 25 minutes. I would allow 1 hour for time to and from the parks. More if you are having dinner at a different resort. Transportation doesn't take you from the Port Orleans to the Contemporary, Floridian, or Animal Kingdom Lodge. We had dinners and breakfast at each of those and you have to take a bus to a theme park and then board another bus going to your specific resort. The French Quarter has one bus stop and our neighbor resort has four. The good news is that the French Quarter is the first stop, but that means you are boarding a bus that is rarely empty. Before you get to your park, the bus must stop at the remaining bus stops at the Riverside Resort. People get off and get on, so you can plan on standing as much as you will have a seat. The cost of laundry is $2 to wash and dry. This was my third trip to Disney World, the first of which when I stayed on property. On property is the way to go with a meal plan. The extra hours in the morning and evening offer some nice flexibilities in your plans. Not to mention the fast pass option that compliments your on property status. This was the first trip in which we planned during summer time and it will be the last. Next time we are pulling kids from school and going when no one is there.

Oh and for those reading this from the UK the fridge is a normal size kitchen fridge so plenty of room for beer and other provisions.

The Foodcourt was good, although the children got a little fed up with Macaroni cheese or chicken nuggets but for adults we could always find something we fancied and did not try everything. We enjoyed on a few occasions walking up to Riverside in the evening to eat at the Foodcourt, where there is a different and larger selection although alot busier. The walk to Riverside was lovely, we were surprised how few people walked along by the river. There was a good selection at breakfast, we especially liked the Beignets and the Mickey Waffles. You could buy milk and cerial in the shop and therefore eat in your room is you wished. Oh and as for the resort mugs they saved us a lot of money. Although the initial cost seems steep, when you work out how much soft and hot drinks would cost over a two week holiday its certainly worth it. The pool was lovely, the children especially enjoyed the waterslide. The hotel supplies towels and life jackets for the children to wear, although on a few occasions if you returned to the hotel later in the day for a swim there were no jackets left and occasionally no sun loungers. The children loved the little animals (rabbits and squirrels) that ran around the grounds even the pool area during the day. The disney bus service worked great, as others have said the French Quarter is the first pick up before the bus goes on to Riverside (sometimes is didn't?) you could always get a seat going to the parks, coming back was another matter. At least it dropped off first but at 11.30 at night after standing holding two children asleep that was little consilation.

Our bus came really quick and we didn't have to worry about picking up our luggage b/c it's automatically delivered to our room. After arriving at the resort, we had a smooth check-in experience and the hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful in the whole process. Our room was just as described, cozy and clean. The bathroom is rather small but I love how they place the sinks outside and with two of them, we can get ready at the same time in the morning. There was only one small inconvenience which I thought they could improve-we didn't have the \"do not disturb\" sign that usually can be put outside of your room. The housekeeping lady often comes around 9am since they assume most people are already heading to the parks. We liked to sleep in so it was sort of a nusiance. The bus taking you to the parks comes very frequent. The average wait time is around 10-15 minutes. sometimes sooner. French Quarter is the first stop for pick-up so we always had seats. The best thing about the bus is when we return from the parks at night, French Quarter is the first stop for drop-off. The ferry ride to downtown disney was only about 10 minutes and you can enjoy the scenary while in transit. We stayed in Building 6, which was kind of far from the food court and the bus stop, but it's only a 5 minutes walk. The food court offers same food everyday but you do have serveral options. We didn't use the pool b/c it was too \"kiddy\", but the hot-tub was very nice, albeit a little small. Overall I enjoyed my stay Port Orleand-French Quarter very much.

It provides about a 10 minute trip to Downtown Disney. The resort is relatively close to all theme parks. The best part is that French Quarter is the first pick-up and first drop-off to and from the parks!

After a long day at the parks, the last thing I would want is to have to stand for the ride back! If I had to discuss one area of improvement, it would be the food choices. But in reality, this wasn't a real problem. The resort offers a \"food court\" with somewhat of a variety. It is important to remember that the food is not gourmet quality and is priced according to Disney standards.

So, we finally got to go on our honeymoon after 2.5 years of marriage. We stayed at Port Orleans French Quarter from March 18-24 and had a wonderful time. The resort is beautiful and very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Check-in lasted 10 minutes, if that and we were given a handicapped room with no bathtub so we thought we were going to have to go through a long ordeal of arguing since the whole resort was booked but, I simply asked nicely if they could figure something out since it was our honeymoon and the situation was very quickly resolved with a nice king bedroom right across from the pool with a bathtub. No problems there. Mousekeeping was flawless and our room was spotless the whole time we were there. We were left fresh towels EVERYDAY even when we had hung our towels to show that we would reuse them. Our shampoo and soap was replinished everyday and we had enough to take home some mickey soaps/shampoos for our family. We had nice little bows made out of towels and they even tied a bow out of the toilet paper. The resort is a very nice layout and it is hard to be far from anything. There is no more than a 5 min. walk to anything on property. The boat launch was very near our room and a great relaxing ride to Downtown Disney area. We did not take the buses because we had our car and prefered to drive and that worked out great because you get free parking at all the theme parks when you stay on property. The foodcourt was very close to our room and had okay food. They have pretty good hotdogs and a nice variety of food. The giftshop carries any of the little things you might forget to pack and many nice gift items. The only complaint I have about the entire stay was that, despite the 80 degree temps most of our trip, the nice sparkling pool very close to our room was FREEZING and we could not really swim in it. We took a couple quick dunks and ran back to the room to put on a sweatshirt. It states in all the brochures etc that Disney Resort pools are \"heated.\" This is listed as an amenity but we do not feel we had use of this amenity at all and it should not be listed as such. We also stayed at All-star Movies for one night on the 25th and though it was clean and adequate it did not have nearly the ambience and romantic atmosphere of Port Orleans French Quarter. We felt it was more appropriate for people traveling with small children. Whereas, Port Orleans had a more mature feel to it.

However, early in the morning this didn't work so well. We took in Magic Kingdom and headed back to our room at about 2pm. Our assigned room was ready upon our arrival. The rooms are fine but certainly not outstanding and hardly a great value. They are nicely adorned but dated. The food was truly awful (and pricey). They had some fresh fruit but most of the fare consisted of the fried variety. It really wouldn't be that hard to institute a more creative and varied menu but I guess they are simpy giving the guests what they want. The food really turned me off ever staying here again. I tried a vegetarian sandwich which was almost the worst thing I've ever tasted. My son, 7 1/2, ordered a hot dog which turned out to be almost a footlong and was accompanied by a bun which split and wouldn't even hold the monster dog...perhaps a kid's menu? The access to the theme parks, whether by bus or boat, was nice. The pool area was too busy to even think of trying to find a spot. Overall, I would not stay here again.

I decided not to pay extra for a river view and have no regrets, the courtyard is lovely and the parking lot wasn't visible so no eyesores. The decor was nice too and it didn't seem over the top like some of the other moderate or value resorts. Upon arrival the room was clean and someone was already getting us extra towels. We did leave a tip daily for the person cleaning our room and it seemed appreciated. We would come home after a long day to a clean room and a little \"surprise\" of toys arranged in a funny scene or a towel made into an animal. We also stocked the minifridge to full capacity with breakfast and snack foods so it was a money and time saver. We used the boat to go to Downtown Disney twice even though we had our car. It's a relaxing ride and it made the journey just as much fun as the destination. Our 5 and 2 year old loved any mode of transporation other than the car. My oldest said her favorite part of the day we went to MGM was the bus ride there (it was the only day we took the shuttle bus). I agree with other reviewers to allow extra bus time due to the Riverside stops but since the kids were having fun I didn't mind.

Our 3 night land resort was the Animal Kingdom Lodge (AKL), which we liked MUCH better. The Port Orleans French Quarter (POFQ) is a lower level of resort compared to AKL, so we already had lower expectations. Even still, this was just not as nice as we had hoped and did not meet our expectations. This resort is grouped with the Port Orleans Riverside (POR), so there are LOTS more people here in general. If you are planning to visit any of the parks using the Disney Transport system, keep in mind that the buses serve both POFQ and POR together. The 1st stop is POFQ. Once you board, you spend another 15-20 minutes riding through POR to pick up all other guests before the ride over to any of the parks. When returning from the parks, the bus system can get totally overloaded, and it's not unusual to have to wait for 3 or more buses to come and go before you get your turn to ride back home. Unfortunately, some guests even broke in line, making the transport experience quite frustrating.

The rooms are clean and the place looks generally well cared for. Rooms have a small fridge in them. The pool is nice, but can get very crowded.

First of all if you are staying at a Disney resort and flying into Orlanda look into the Magical Express. This is one of the best ways to start off your vacation. When you land all you do is go to the counter and get on the bus. You don't have to get your luggage or anything. They show you a little video telling you about some of the new attractions and shows. Seriously GREATEST THING EVER! Oh and it's free until October or something, but I would have paid for this service. There are only two things I didn't like the first was check in. It TOOK FOREVER. Be prepared because like you everyone will have a million questions about their rooms, tickets, parks, etc. etc. Don't get me wrong, the girl checking us in was nice, polite, and took her time explaining everything. It's just that when you first get there you just want to go see Mickey! We were in Building 7 with three waterview rooms. (This was a bonus since only 1 was supposed to be a waterview room). If you are looking for a quieter place and don't mind being further away from the food court this is a great place to be. We didn't hear anything in the mornings or at night and the walk to the food court was like 2 minutes. We got the refill mugs and they were great, so long as you had them with you when you wanted something. The food was pretty good. My mom and sister really like the beignets (sp?). We didn't really eat there much as we were in the parks pretty much every day. The only other thing I didn't like was the concierge staff.

One thing to keep in mind, if you are planning on going to other resorts to eat (we went to JIKO at Animal Kingdom Lodge) be prepared it takes a while and you have to transfer buses.

The room was very spacious for 2 adults and I loved the fact that the sinks were separate from the shower/tub area. This made getting ready in the morning quick and easy. Housekeeping was wonderful and we never had a problem. The grounds are amazing and quite romantic. I purposely picked this resort since other reviewers mentioned that the resort is much smaller than other Disney resorts. The cobblestone streets and gardens were breathtaking. It is a about a 10 minute walk along the river to Port Orlean's Riverside which I would suggest doing. The food at POFQ was decent. I read so many reviews that the food was horrible but I really didn't think that was true, however, the majority of our dining experience consisted of breakfast. We also had breakfast at the BoatRight's Dining Hall in Riverside and that was great for a sitdown restaurant...try the sweet potato pancakes or banana stuffed french toast. The transportation to the parks was very efficient. We never waited more than 10-15 minutes for a ride. And the parks didn't seem that crowded the week we were there.

Sometimes the drivers change up their routes, which meant being dropped off at POFQ last.

The French Quarter setting is wonderful, impeccably maintained, quite and serene. The rooms are a different story. Upon check in, there were cobwebs in our room over the valance, light fixture over the table and over the bed. We had to ask for the sheets to be changed (and for the correct size sheets to be used). The coffee pots were never cleaned and we had to request more coffee every other day (until they finally brought each of our rooms, three of them, and garbage bag full of coffee). The bathrooms were not thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis and we again had to ask for more towels, soap and kleenex. Before we checked in, I had faxed the front desk a request for a building close to the bus stop for my 75 year old grandmother and for our rooms to be as close together as possible. My parents and Grandmother had rooms next door to each other in building 3, along the river at the back of the property. My wife and I ended up in the far corner of the building (1326) overlooking the water and the golf course. This was I think as far away as the could put us. We tipped mousekeeping daily and nothing special was done and the rooms were not cleaned adequetly. The one nice thing was that we did tell the Front Desk that we were celebrating our 5th anniversary, my grandmother's 75th birhtday, and my father's 56th birthday, and all of us got a signed card and picture from various Disney characters. NOTHING is close and everything requires a 10-20 minute bus ride. The boat to Pleasure Island was great (15 min) and a great diversion from the buses. We never had to wait more than about 10 minutes for a bus to any of the parks and were always the first to be picked up and the first to be let off. Overall, I would probably try one of the Luxury hotels next time in hopes of better mousekeeping. On a side note, we ate dinner at Raglan Road Pub in Pleasure Island!

You can then refill the mug as much as you'd like without having to spend more money each time you want to get a drink. The pool was really nice. It was not as crowded as we thought it would be for a summer stay in the pool. The bus service was good though the bus drivers left alot ot be desired with their driving skills.

The pool, one of the best aspects of the hotel, was clean, nicely themed and had a fun slide and water fall area. I think the FQ is one of the smaller resorts when not considered in conjunction with the adjacent PO Riverside. This is nice because it doesn't seem to get overcrowded or congested, although we were there during value season. The size and layout also make it easy to get around. We comfortably strolled the whole resort one day so if your not right at the pool or main lobby area it's easy to get to. As opposed to large buildings with elevators they have several 2 and 3 story walk-up buildings which you enter from the outside, either street level for first floor or from the balcony and upper floors. Therefore you do not have a private balcony or patio. We were on the first floor and since the large but only window in the room faced the street/walkway it made the room feel a little exposed when the curtains were drawn. The rooms were fairly clean but not immaculate. The carpet could have used a better vacuuming especially in the corners and the ledge of the window where the air-conditioning unit was needed to be wiped down. The bathroom was okay; I didn't notice any mildew or mold problems. Our air-conditioner cooled the room off well and though slightly loud not disturbing. The laundry facility had a good number of washers and dryers. The transportation service was great and since the resort area is small it's easy to get to the bus station from any room at the resort. It is also the first stop going to the parks so you're more likely to get a seat and it's the first stop on the return so you'll get back sooner. The biggest drawback to this resort was the inadequate dining and poor food. There is NO full-service restaurant in the FQ only a food court which I found to have really POOR quality food and I don't have gourmet tastes. At breakfast I tried a Mickey shaped waffle that wasn't fully cooked, it tasted like there was some raw batter in the middle. I would have been much happier toasting a frozen Eggo waffle. The eggs were also bad. They do have assorted fruits and cold cereals that we would eat at breakfast. The pre-made sandwiches at lunch were fine. At dinner the mashed potatoes tasted terrible, I think they were instant. The macaroni and cheese was bad too. Again I would have been happier microwaving some Kraft Easy Mac. The pizza wasn't very good either; I've had frozen brands I liked better. The prices at the food court aren't cheap either. I don't mind paying if I get decent food. There is a full-service restaurant on the Riverside section of the resort which would be a fair walk from the FQ but not excessive. As I understand it several of the other moderate resorts have rooms that are far from the resort's own dining facilities. You can also take the bus or boat to Downtown Disney for more dining options. The staff were neither exceptionally courteous nor rude. There is a small gift shop that also sells some snack items and drinks if you need something later at night. There is also an arcade. If staying at another moderate resort I would still consider the FQ. I found the small size and lack of congestion to be a nice break from the busy parks and rooms are convenient to the pool and transportation. Knowing what to expect from the food service makes it easier to plan accordingly. I would like to try one of the Deluxe resorts that have private balconies and possibly bettter cleaned rooms.

They were so excited when we finally made it all the way from Kentucky. Our whole experience at POFQ was one to remember. We had an excellent housekeeper who left the cutest creatures out of towels on two of our days there. Our children loved it! We stayed in building 5 and our room had a view of the Sassagoula River and the beautiful courtyard. It was a great location, close to the river, pool, food court, store, etc. Our room was very pleasant and I loved the curtain between the room and the sink area. That is a plus when my husband and boy's are still sleeping. The Sassagoula Floatworks & Food Factory (food court) was great. Our family was able to find something that each of use wanted everytime we went there. I will have to admit we liked the food better at POFQ & PORiverside better than the food at the Wilderness Lodge. And Wilderness Lodge is a deluxe resort versus POFQ being a moderate resort. The pool-all the reviews on the pool were right, it's a child's dream pool. The huge Sea Serpent was \"so awesome\" in my kids words. The slide was great. The only negative thing about the slide, when the lifeguards go home they close the slide down. So, if you go out for a late night swim w/ the kids - they may not be able to use the slide. That is the only thing the boy's didn't like much. But the pool stays open until midnight, which is good if you are coming back from the parks late. We took the river cruise down to Riverside and it was nice. Very relaxing. Fulton's General Store at Riverside is huge. We enjoyed just walking around looking at everything. We were going to eat at Boatwright's Dining Hall (in riverside) but we checked the menu out and we really didn't find anything we liked. So we decided to just eat at Riverside Mill (food court) and we were very pleased with the food there. So, in ending my review about POFQ-we had a wonderful time there.

On our first trip to Disney, we stayed at the Carribean Beach Resort, and then tried the Animal Kingdom Lodge for our second trip...both of which were magical. Having made a conscious decision to try a new Disney property each time, we opted for the POFQ this time around. A few selling points were the intimacy, the close proximity to the pool, common area and the buses, and the lovely grounds. We headed for Florida right as Hurricane Dennis was hitting the panhandle, and so we feared that this would negatively impact our long awaited return to Disney. We contacted the POFQ, and were gently reassured that all was well, and that we should go forth with our plans. From that point on, the \"Disney Magic\" took over, and we were on our way to a wonderful experience. As we arrived on the grounds of POFQ, a deluge of rain had gripped the area, and so everything was dark, dreary, and soaked. Nevertheless, as we headed into the Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory Food Court, we noticed that everyone was cheerful, relaxed, and enjoying themselves. Perhaps it was the jazz musician playing in the bar, or the boldly cheerful Mardis Gras decor, or the calming fountain in the foyer...whatever it was, it certainly made us feel instantly welcome. We made our way to the reservation desk and were greeted by a sweet older man who handled our information carefully and sincerely. By nature, he was genuinely interested in who we were, and wanted to ensure that we were taken care of in the \"Disney Way\". I can't remember his name, but he was representative of almost all the workers we had the pleasure to meet during our stay. We had no troubles at all finding our building (#6), as everything is within a very short walking distance. We were also pleased to find the bus station just a few short \"blocks\" away. We were on the third floor, and it wasn't until our fifth and final trip of lugging our bags up and down the stairs that we realized there was indeed an elevator. We should have known that Disney would have been accommodating. Without a doubt, we made sure to use the elevator at the end of our trip. Our room was delightful, with very comfortable beds, a picturesque view of the gardens, and a privacy curtain to boot. Disney always thinks of every last detail!!! With the exception of our housekeeping service, we were quite pleased. Although the room appeared to be clean, there was a flattened bug on the ceiling, and a piece of a barbecue chip under our unused bedsheets. We are still baffled by that, as we had yet to sleep in our beds. Perhaps a hungry housekeeper? We prefer not to think that the sheets had been left unwashed from the previous guest. We will assume that this is an aberration and know without a doubt that it is not up to Disney standards. It is simply unfair to expect perfection. Furthermore, after reading several trip advisor reviews, I had been alerted to the possibility that our housekeeper would not leave behind special surprises of folded hand towels or toys in the window. Keeping that in mind, I prepped my child for this potential, and reminded her that she had already had the priviledge of returning \"home\" from the parks with special surprises when we stayed at the Carribean Beach Resort, so she should consider herself lucky with just that experience alone. And, just as I had predicted, our housekeeper did not outdo him/herself, and seemed to have trouble just making our beds. Each day, our comforters were merely lifted up over the sheets, and slopped back down on the mattress. This service remained consistent until we left. Again, not a case of Disney failing at their duties, just merely a worker who hasn't quite figured it all out yet. We ate at the food court several times, and were always entertained by the colorful surroundings. There was an exceptional variety of food, and we enjoyed every morsel. A good and tasty bargain for a family is the large pizza. We were able to eat for just $22.00, with left overs to boot. Thanks to the complimentary refrigerator in our room, we were able to nibble on it for late night snacks for a couple nights thereafter. My husband and I both agreed that the prices were not outrageous, and are comparable to any food chain or nice restaurant. The pool was a kid's dream come true, and it was so imaginatively decorated. Our daughter has made us promise to come back just so that she can swim in that pool! The hot tub was behind the laundry room, in a secluded, intimate area. At first, I was perplexed by its location, but keeping in mind that you typically use the spa for relaxation and meditation, it seemed to be the perfect placement. It was shrouded by shrubbery and trees, and it certainly afforded me the rest and relaxation I needed after a day in the parks. We enjoyed walking the \"streets\" of The French Quarter, and were amused by their names. So often, Disney guests are in such a rush, that they fail to notice the subtle, yet well orchestrated intricacies and hidden beauties that Disney has so carefully planned out. The first time we were at Disney, we were all about the parks and the mad rush from one attraction to the next, that we didn't stop and think how lucky we were to be in such a spectacular place. So, I made certain to enjoy this time around, and I do believe I will break our pact, and return to POFQ the next time we head back down for our Disney fix.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joplin MO", "Title": "\u201cWould return again in a heart beat\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3693034", "Content": "We visited WDW for the first time in July 2005 and decided to stay at the French Quarter.

We had an excellent time. Check in was not fast but efficient. If you want baggage or bellboy help you have to ask for it otherwise front desk will not offer it unles requested. We requested our building location 3 days before we got there and our request was fullfilled. Our room was in prime location to everything. We were in building 5 pool(water) view which was a short walk to all amenities. This room had a great view of the pool(right in center). It was a short walk to the food court, pool area, laundry room, ferry to downtown disney, gift shop, lobby area, bike rentals, you name it. Our room had 2 double beds with mini refrigerator, hairdryer, and wall safe. Our safe did not have a key so a quick call down to the front desk and they quickly replaced the lock. It's a key so no remembering combinations which is a plus on my book. It was really clean. If you need extra towels housekeeping is so nice and quick too. They even made our face towel into a duck one day. The room was quiet even by the pool. It was also the perfect size for a family with small children. You may need a little extra room with teenagers. My 2 children enjoyed the pool with it's awesome dragon slide. Especially my 7 year old. The only downside to the dragon slide was if you had a younger child like my 3 year old who wanted to go on the slide but not alone you can not go with them. Adults are allowed but you can not slide down 2 at a time. So she only got on it twice by herself which was not a great thing. Lifeguards are there when it is open so they keep a pretty watchful eye on any pool rule breakers. The ferry to Downtown Disney was a very short walk from our hotel room. We catched one that stopped by Riverside first. It was a nice ride. Although it was a long ride down the Sassalouga River towards the end my kids were asking are we there yet. On the way back it rained so they closed down the Ferry Ride which was not good. So we took the bus back and of all places Disney has NO line system at Downtown Disney so it was a push and shove kinda deal in the rain. Not very good if you have small children. My suggestion is drive to Downtown Disney. It is a short drive with your car. A lot less time waiting for the bus and a lot less pushing and shoving. Some People were thoughtless. My husband had to stand up with my daughter in his arms for half the bus ride. The food court was o.k. to. They served Mickey breakfast waffles for a reasonable price. We ate there Dinner as well and it was o.k. it was like eating in a cafeteria. The only downfall, Milk was overpriced 25cent milk cartons were over $1.00. It was better to buy at the gift shop. There is no full service restaurant at this resort. You would have to go to Riverside. The laundry facilities were soso. It cost me $6.00 to do 1 load. $2.00 for wash. $2.00 for each dry. I had to double up on the dryer cause it did not dry the first time. We used the concierge service to purchase our tickets and they were quite friendly and helpful. There is a live band playing in the lobby from Wed-Saturday. My kids enjoyed it. We did take the bus to Magic Kingdon from the hotel and it took a while but was well worth it. Each Hotel has its own bus to and from the parks. we did not have to share a bus with Riverside. So overall this was a very convenient hotel to stay with your family if you have small children.

My wife and I stayed for 2 weeks in May 2005. Firstly although we arrived before our check in time, the room was ready and the reception staff were very freindly and helpful, booking in was very simple and the young lady gave a simple but useful explaination of the resort and its' facilities. We were in our room within ten minutes of arriving on site. The room was in block 3, which was perfectly located for all amenaties. The room was lovely with a real 'homestyle' feeling to it. We felt really comfortable with the whole resort from the moment we arrived. The foodhall (The sasagoulla floatworks & dining hall) offered a wide range of food for all tastes. The value for money was very good and the standards were above food court average. My wife & I are both vegetarian and it was a welcome change to have more than a cheese pizza as your dinner option. The staff in the foodcourt were always helpful and very friendly. The swimming pool is capped by a colourful sea serpent adorned with king neptune and accompanied by some jazz styled 'gators. Scat cats bar is great if your legs are tired at the end of the day, the resident musician is fantastic and can play so many instruments it beggars belief. (Sharp eyed guests will recognise him as the sax player from the Blues Brothers show at Universal studios!) He is great to listen to and is a natural entertainer. The hotel is an easy journey to all of the Disney parks by disney bus service and the boat service to downtown disney was a joy in itself. The 20 minute ferry service passed by some areas you don't normally see such as the old tree house style accomodation that was part of the disney institute. These were damaged by the hurricanes last year and are now closed. The Riverside resort is only 10 minutes walk up the river and is well worth a visit for Boatwrights dining hall (and also the bar is very comfortable). As other reviewers have said, The French Quarter feels like a deluxe resort for a moderate price and I agree fully with this. The staff, rooms, service, food and value for money is VERY good. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the above!

The kids loved the playground, serpent-themed pool, and kiddie pool. We loved how accessible the bus, food court, gift shop, and pool were to our room. Unfortunately, we never got around to taking a carriage ride, but the kids did like watching the horses go by in the evenings. We took advantage of the boat to Downtown Disney, as well as the Riverside hotel. At Riverside, we rented a surrey bike which was also a nice relaxing opportunity when most of the week we were rushing around the theme parks and water parks. We opted for a Disney hotel so that we wouldn't need to rent a car, and for the most part we were glad we did. The buses do tend to get crowded in the late evenings, so if you stay out too late with little kids and have a stroller to drag along it can be difficult when you have to hold your children and a stroller when no seats are available. Also, we were a little disappointed since we had read that the buses always drop off at Port Orleans before Riverside. This is not always true. It depends on whether you are coming from a theme park or from Downtown Disney. The other advantage of the Disney hotel was that we could easily leave to take an afternoon nap, then return to the parks at dinner time. Speaking of food, in the food court, breakfast is the best meal of the day. The other meals are just ok. Other items we liked in the food court were the fruit and cheese plate and fruit bowl, which were an excellent healthy snack option. The rooms are not luxurious, but on a family vacation we aren't expecting luxury. They were comfortable and adequate for a family of 4 with a portable crib in the room. The grounds, though, were much more luxurious than other hotels with similar room types. The landscaping is lush, beautiful.

I wanted to return the favor and have added my own collection of experiences, in no particular order... I stayed at Port Orleans French Quarter with my wife and 7 1/2 year old son from May 6th through May 13th. It was a great time of year to choose. You beat the summer crowds (read: extremely long lines), summer heat, and will even save on the not-so-peak costs of airfare. And of course, my son was thrilled to miss a week of school. At check-in you have the option to tie-in your room key to your credit card. Do it. Using your room key makes it so easy to purchase everything from gifts to food, and there will be no need to checkout at the end of your trip. There is a $1,000.00 credit line put on the card key, but you can increase it if you need to. Anything you purchase in any of the parks can be sent to your resort's gift shop for you by the next day, and there is no addition charge for this. Who wants to carry around nick-knacks all day? We took advantage of this big time. The \"Disney Magical Express\" is a new service being offered by Disney as of 5/6/05. We were told by our travel agent, as well as by Disney's web site that we would receive \"special\" Disney tags for our luggage (21 days before we left), that, once we land at Orlando, we would not have to concern ourselves with finding our luggage. Just walk from the plane to the resort bus and our luggage would \"Magically\" appear in our hotel rooms when we arrived. Well, after numerous calls to our travel agent (who called Disney directly even while in my presence) to find out where the hell our tags were, as well as calls placed to Disney by me, the tags never showed (so much for Magical). We were starting to become disillusioned at Disney's ability to pull off such a feat. We landed at 9:30 a.m. and by 10:00 a.m. (after 15 minutes of standing in line... so much for Express) we were trying to identify what our luggage looked like from a huge chart of luggage photos. If you have ever lost luggage with a carrier before, you'll know what I mean. I got on my bus, worrying \"Now what?\" I made calls every 45 minutes, and no one even knew where our luggage was. Cutting to the chase, our luggage arrived between 3:00 and 3:30 that day. Not horrible, but not happy either. Our bathing suits were packed in our luggage, so we had to buy swim suits at the gift shop so we could at least swim. Going home it\u2019s all up to you. Drag your luggage to the bus, to your airline's check in counter and then to TSA security. The Hotel was nice, and in much better shape that I expected. Bedding, curtains and carpeting were in excellent shape, (except for 2 pronounced marble sized lumps under the carpeting) and the bathroom was neat and clean, with enough towels for 3 of us. We stayed in room 2146, midway between the pool and the restaurant. I highly recommend a ground floor room. My only complaints about the room are a VERY small safe, and not many extra receptacles. In this age of technology I need 2 outlets for our cell phones, 2 for digital camera equipment, and one for a laptop charger. The double beds are a little small for adults to share, but you\u2019ll be so exhausted you\u2019ll be willing to sleep on a bed of nails. We never saw any of those cutesy animal shaped towels we heard so much about, even though there was obvious evidence of a child in our room. I thought I remembered jazz music playing throughout the place the day we arrived (Fri.). Sunday night, at midnight, music started playing from a speaker in the tiny playground across from our room. I'm not sure if it played anywhere else in the park. By 1:45 am, I called the front desk to complain about it. They said they would look into it. I had to turn the ac up to high to drown out to music. By 6 a.m. the music was off. Midnight Monday, the same thing happened again, but it was off by 3 a.m. I complained to the front desk and the next night all was fine. I guess Disney couldn't figure out how to reset the music time clock, so they just shut it off. We never heard music again, anywhere in the resort, day or night. The food court is just mediocre. My suggestions would be to stick with the grilled chicken sandwich (you have to ask for the lettuce and tomato or else you won't get them), but stay away from their pizza (GAK!). The breakfast buffet is very good. I liked the King Creole and the Croissant Sandwich. We ate dinner at the Boatwrights restaurant in Riverside and I thought the meat was great, my wife wasn't thrilled by it. Also, while at Riverside's food court, stay away from anything even resembling a McNugget. Riverside's dining area was MUCH more charming and inviting than in the French Quarter, as is their hotel's lobby. Their waterside dining area is very nice and has much more ambience. It's is a shame the French Quarter didn't take advantage of it's beautiful waterside setting and use it for something. I feared being gouged by Disney for all of my food purchases, but was pleasantly surprised to find that they were very much in line with what I am used to (New York City prices), along with some decent deals thrown in. BBQ'd ribs with plenty of mashed potato and a vegetable was under $10.00. Not bad at all, and the breakfast menu was equally acceptable. Alcohol may get a little expensive. Plastic beer bottles (at the poolside bar or the food court) and mixed drinks from the poolside bar will cost you between $4.25 and $6.50 (or more), but you can buy cold Corona in glass bottles (and more) in the gift shop for only $2.25. I had a room fridge, and the gift shop was my best friend. The food court can only sell you 1 beer (state law) even if you are buying 6 meals at one shot. However, you can buy all you want at once in the gift shop. Riverside also has bicycle and boat rentals. An hour for a little two-seater boat is only $35.00. The boats aren't fast by any means, but they are meant to be relaxing. You can motor to Downtown Disney in 20 minutes and buzz around the bay a few times before heading back. Travel to the parks is a 15-minute ride at most and we never waited more than 15 minutes for any bus. Staying at the French Quarter had the added benefit of being picked up first and dropped off first (before traveling off to 4 stops in Riverside)...very nice indeed. Buses were clean and the drivers were chatty if you wanted them to be. Buses to Magic Kingdom were direct runs home to the French Quarter. The staff, everywhere, is amazing! I don't know how these people (A.K.A. underpaid cast members) can smile all day in the hot sun. They were able to give instant answers to all of questions, give directions, and make suggestions. Wanna' stay for the fireworks? Supposedly the best fireworks show is at Magic Kingdom. (Not surprised). It was the only show we saw. People were lining up curbside on Main Street 2 1/2 hours before the show started. They're nuts. Just make your way to Main Street 10 minutes before the show and stand anywhere on the sidewalk 60 seconds before the show starts, then, like everyone does, walk into the street to watch the 20 minute show. We stood halfway up Main Street and saw an awesome show. Also, as a side benefit, we were that much closer to the main entrance/exit and made the second bus to our resort. The fireworks start at closing time, so it might be better to see the fireworks on a night when the park is open late for Disney guests. Then the \"mad rush\" for the exit probably wouldn't be so bad. It might be a little better to stand towards the left side of the street (while facing the castle) as Tinkerbell would be a bit more visible during the show. She flies from the castle down that loooooong, black cable that is so visible during the daytime. We are early risers, so eating breakfast at 7:00 and being at the bus shelter by 7:45 is not a problem. You'll be through the bag inspection and at the ticket machine by 8:30. It's worth the 30-minute wait there \u2018til the park opens. They'll be a ton of people behind you when you go through and you'd probably have to wait 30 minutes to get through the gate at that point anyway. In that 30-minute span we had been on premium rides at least twice. There is nothing worse than standing on line with kids. RIDES: Go to the library and get 2 or 3 books on WDW and spend a lot of time on the Internet reading peoples reviews of the rides. We made a list of primary and secondary rides to hit, and that saved us a lot of time just wandering aimlessly around the entire map. It's a bit of a hustle, but armed with this knowledge, we could complete the park in a day (by 4 p.m.) Our son is 7 1/2 so we were able to skip stuff like character breakfasts (he would die!!) and the teacup ride (he would kill us!!) We were able to get a ton of character photos and autographs all over the parks. Note: The Extra Terrorestrial Alien Encounter attraction, that we so much wanted to experience was replaced by Lilo and Stitch... so it was scary, big deal. Leave something cool for the older kids and parents to truly enjoy. Damn you, Disney execs! Our list of must-see, DO NOT MISS attractions: MGM: Indiana Jones (kick-ass live show) Tower of Terror Rock-n Roller Coaster (I thought a bit bumpy for a new-ish coaster) Lights, Motors, Action (New for 2005) Skip Star Tours. My son is a Star Wars fanatic and was really let down by this stinker. Lunch in Commissary Lane was very good. Try the Tuna steak in Mama Melrose\u2019s for a late lunch. The place is all but empty by 2:00. EPCOT: Mission: SPACE Test Track Soarin' (new for 2005) \"fly\" in front of 360 degree screen...smell the oranges.... yummmm Skip Universe of Energy unless you're a BIG Ellen Degeneress fan. Skip It Sounds Dangerous even if you're a BIG Drew Carey fan. The butterfly house was a let down. Lunch in Germany was a delicious buffet. $16.for adults, $8 for kids. Cute show. Dinner in Italy is highly recommended. MAGIC KINGDOM: Splash Mountain Big Thunder Mountain Mickey's Philharmagic (sounds lame but it was really quite good) Buzz Lightyear (cool if you have any kid under 9) Space Mountain (We missed The Timekeeper but it's supposed to be good) Classic rides (lame by today\u2019s standards) I remember from MY childhood that I couldn't miss... Peter Pan's Flight Pirates of the Caribbean Swiss Family Tree house Haunted Mansion Tomorrowland Indy Speedway Snow White's Scary Adventures Tomorrowland Transit Authority WDW Railroad (a REAL steam driven train) ANIMAL KINGDOM: It's Tough to be a Bug (great 3-d!) Kilimanjaro Safari (too bouncy for photo's, just enjoy the ride/animals) Festival of the Lion King (live show well done) The Kali River Rapids was closed when we were there. It was the one thing we wanted to do there. My son loved Dinoland. It has a traveling carnival atmosphere. Lunch in Rainforest Cafe'. The Tree of Life is pretty cool. There are a ton of animals \"carved\" into its trunk. We probably could have skipped Animal Kingdom altogether. It's not that it was done poorly, it's just that once you've been to the Bronx Zoo, everything else sort of pales in comparison. We are big on rides and this park had VERY little to offer. We tried to make a reservation at The Rain Forest Caf\u00e9 via our concierge at 7:30 one morning. They pulled up the reservations menu for that restaurant, and showed us all the available seating times. Then we were told we could not make reservations for the same day. I went to the park (A.K.) and made them there at 8:30 a.m. This is a senseless inconvenience. The pool pretty small by resort standards, but is just nice enough, and has a small slide that the kids just loved. A bigger pool might mean you\u2019d prefer to stay poolside all day and not spend money in one of the parks. It\u2019s heated between 82 and 85 degrees. The lifeguards are constantly patrolling around the pool. We thought that was a bit over cautious, until we found out why. They are on poop patrol! They announced that we must leave the pool for an unscheduled cleaning. The mad exodus reminded me of the Baby Ruth scene from Caddy Shack. Pretty funny. All in all our experience was a very good, albeit an expensive one. We expected the cost to be pretty high so it wasn't a total shock when we tallied up our expenses at the end of our trip. Controlling yourself in the gift shops is key. Do you really need a Captain Hook costume, or a Mickey Mouse beer stein? Probably not, and don't buy large items that you won't get into your luggage. Don't buy stuff you can get at home for a much cheaper price. (I.e. all the Star Wars toys sold at Star Tours). There is a resort mug you can buy for 12 or so dollars that lets you get free refills. We avoided this since we didn\u2019t want our son loading up on soda all day long, as well as having to schlep cups around all day. I wouldn\u2019t have my child drink $12.00 worth of soda in a month at home. For $2300.00 (travel agent) for airfare, hotel 7 nights, and park hopper tickets for 3 people, FQ is an awesome deal.

The also loved the masks in the dining hall. My only \"small complaint\" would be that they should carry some of the lushness inside the dining hall, with plants and flowers. It would feel less like a cafeteria. The food was quite good in our opinion and we liked that you could also buy a la carte for our two-year-old (fruit and yogurt, cereal, etc.) We never had to wait for more than one bus and always got seats since they pick up FQ before Riverside and drop off first too. When the park closed FQ had its own bus and was the shortest line since it is the smallest resort. I think we waited for the second bus because we were busy folding the stroller.

It was our 5th Disney property over the past 10 years we've stayed at, and now consider it to be the best. Simple reason was size. Each and every resort we've been at has been all we could ask for, but the French Quarter is a smaller property and you don't get the crowds/hassles that the larger resorts simply can't avoid. FOOD: just one restaurant, cafeteria type set up, nothing fancy (pasta, hamburgers, pizza, etc), but perfect for breakfast before hitting the parks. GROUNDS: well manicured with scaled down walkways that look like roads. Each of the buildings (we were number 3 of I believe 6 in total) are less than a 2 minute walk from the restaurant, pool, boat lauch, bus stops. Unlike other resorts which can be 10-15 minute walks from room to restaurant, no worries at French Quarter if you need to run back for something. ROOMS: does the job, 2 double beds (one king available as well), sitting area, 2 sinks and seperate bath. Came with iron, coffee maker, hairdryer, safe, minifridge. We rented cot for my son ($15/day). Nice if it was included, but better than getting a terrible nights sleep trying to share a double bed with a child. POOL: fantastic pool, water slide and never overly crowded due to it's large size and less guests to use it. TRANSPORTATION: Disney buses are the best, come every 5 minutes to any and all parks. Port Orleans Riverside is the French Quarter's sister resort and is quite large, sits next door. It has 5 seperate bus stops, the French Quarter has only one. Nice advantage is the bus stop at French Quarter first, so you always get onto an empty bus. By the time it makes it's rounds through Riverside, the bus is packed, people standing. And equally as nice, on the way back from the parks, French Quarter is the first stop. Another nice touch is the water launch that runs to and from Downtown Disney. It's a quiet 10 minute lazy ride that our son loved. Bit cool at night, but much more relaxing than the bus. SERVICE: smiles all around, check in not a problem. While we have enjoyed each of the other resorts, the French Quarter will be our preferred Disney resort simply for the relaxed laid back and quiet atmosphere the others simply can't provide.", "Date": "April 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful spot, we loved it\u201d", "Author": "tk1991", "ReviewID": "UR3400024", "Content": "We stayed at the Port Orleans French Quarter from April 12 to 16th 2005, I don't usually do this type of thing but after using trip advisor so much before we went I thought I would like to give someone our views. There was myself, husband and 6 1/2 yr old. From the moment we landed at the Port Orleans things went smoothly for us, there was no lineup at check in and we arrived around 2:30 and our room was ready, we stayed in building 6, away from the noise of the pool yet close enough. We had a nice river view, and it has an amazing walking/running trail that runs to the PO Riverside, (10 min walk). All the rooms in the PO FQ now come with coffee maker, fridge, hair dryer and iron and ironing board. The rooms are quite spacious and the beds are very comfy. The pool is very nice, very big and very warm. My only complaint about the pool is that you do have to get there early in order to get a spot where you can see your kids in the pool from all angles. My son can swim and the pool is not over his head, however, I like to be able to see him at when he's in the water, there are only about 25 chairs in the section where you can see the entire pool so get there early if you want to see you kids. The lifeguards are constantly walking around and are very good, sometimes a little too strict, but you can't be too careful I guess. The only drawback to the FQ is that it only has the one pool, you can use the ones at Riverside but that is a good 10 15 min walk. The hot tub was nice we did not use it, we have one at home and its not my thing in the hot weather anymore. Very busy all the time as well. The pool bar is nicer and they have tables and chairs to sit but no food service there. The food, basically the food is how do I say it, institutional, everything comes out of bags, or packages, already prepared. Almost everything tastes the same, I am not very picky about what I eat and neither is my husband but after the first night we said that was it and ate off the resorts. Some people may find it ok, and it is, but its just that ok, and its mildly expensive, 5.69 for a hotdog and fries. Some other items were quite reasonable, chicken caesar salad, 7-8 dollars, anyway don't expect great quality food. That is also another drawback about the FQ it only has the food court and a bar which serves appetizers, no sit down restaurant, again you have to go to Riverside for that. The bus service was great, really convenient, never had to wait more than 10 min and if you had to take your car to the parks its alot longer than that , having done it before I know. The buses are air conditioned and the drivers friendly, enjoy this part of your trip as a time to get to know others around you, we met many people and had lots of good conversations on the bus. We took the boat to downtown disney one night and that was great really relaxing and enjoyable, its great no one has to worry about parking or driving. As I read this over it sounds like I am being negative, but we really enjoyed our time at the FQ and went to Riverside on several occasions. The main things to remember are about the pool, if you have young children make sure they stay in one spot or get there early enough to get the spot in the centre. Also don't expect too much food wise. After we left the FQ, we stayed at Pop Century with friends for 5 nights and there is no comparison in the two hotels, anyway that is another story for the Pop Century review.

This was my 5th time visitng WDW, but it was our first staying onsite, and having been spoiled by the FQ, I will never again stay off site. First, we arrived at FQ about noon, and were delighted to know we could check in immediately, which was awesome, since we got unpacked and settled in less than an hour and headed off to start our magical vacation. The rooms are beautifully decorated, very New Orleans feel to them, we loved that the fridge has its own little wooden cabinet and is hidden until you use it. We enjoyed the double sinks, since as a woman I have more cosmetics, etc. than my b/f. The hotel grounds well make up for shelling out extra $$, it's absolutely beautiful, the flowers, water fountains, and streets make it feel like a little village. There is also a river and walking trail behind the hotel. We took the boat to Downtown Diz once and it was very relaxing. The hotel is small and everything is easy to get to, having seen Riverside from the buses, I'm glad we chose FQ, walking at the parks during the day is enough. We ate at the food court several times, once for breakfast, I was glad to see a few vegetarian options (having been an lacto-ovo veg for 10 years). The quality of food was good and the prices weren't too outrageous, but they selection was the same pretty much everyday, they need to offer a few more different items. The refillable mugs are a great idea, I usually drink water, but my b/f drinks a lot of soda so this saved his $$. The pool is a lot of fun and pretty large. We also enjoyed the dragon slide, even though we waited in line with the kids, lol. Perhaps one of our fave features was the Disney transporation, the buses are great!! It's nice not worrying about taking the wrong exit or getting lost. They came about every 15-20 min and were never super crowded, a few times we had to stand but no biggie. We usually came back to our room in the afternoon and swam, napped and ate dinner then went back out to the parks. This was so nice to be able to do, it usually took about 15 minutes to get to the parks, so coming back to the FQ was definitely a refresher after a day of walking through the parks. The staff was also super friendly and we befriended the food manager, Mike, who is a really nice guy, he's usually around the food court so say hi if you see him. All in all, this was the less stressfull disney vacation I've been on, and I can't wait to return to the FQ, I think it's gonna be our permanent Diz headquarters.

Riverside looks huge, and from speaking with people on the bus, you could stay at the Riverside and walk 15 minutes and still not make it to the Riverside restaurants. In the French Quarter, all the rooms are 5 minutes or less from the restauants. Also, the French Quarter is the first of the two resorts to be picked up by the bus (so you get seats) and the first to be dropped off (so you get back to your room sooner).

We ended up in building 7 at the French Quarter, so it was only a 5-10 minute walk to the Riverside restaurants and pool (probably still shorter walk than some rooms within the Riverside).

Since the Wilderness is multiple floors with long hallways, you can hear whenever someone walks by.

It is nicer, smaller, and quieter. The pool and slides surely looked fun. It was too cold for us to actually try them out. There is a path next to the river and is very nice place to get away. Buses come about every 15 minutes, and a boat OR a bus will take you to DownTown Disney which takes about 20 minutes by boat. All the staff is extremely nice.

One of the benefits of this resort, is that all of the rooms are within walking distance of each other and the food court/lobby/pools, etc. As with all of our stays at WDW the rooms were kept immaculately clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The transportation service was also excellent. Buses came frequently, and they have a water taxi that goes to Downtown Disney (a nice ride as well as a form of transportation). Our room was on the second floor, and overlooked the waterway behind the hotel. Don't get me wrong, all of the moderate resorts are pretty nice, but I found this one to be the most convenient and with the best layout.

The pool was a decent size and there was also a small hot tub. The Shuttle service was very good. It came every 20 mins and there was always enough room for us. I also liked the fact that since we stayed in a disney resort we get an extra hr in the morning for each park before it's open for the public. We also went to downtown Disney, which you can either take a bus or a boat from Port Orleans. The last boat leaves Downtown at 11:30pm. One night we had dinner at Ohana resturant in the Polynesian resort..it was very good... 25 bucks for all you can eat... meat and other types of hawaiian food. In addition, you can see fireworks from the resturant at 915pm every nite. If your flight leaves later than your check out time.

Still, I felt very comfortable and secluded from the Disney pace - yet close to the action. Not being too large, everything there is within a short walk. Although I was lucky to score a king bed corner room against the river and promenade, it wasn't far from the boat launch, bus stops, pool and pool bar, lounge, and food service. Downtown Disney and Pleasure Island are just a 15 minute boat ride from this resort - no busses or taxis to get to and from the clubs. The king bed room was spacious, clean, and well kept.

The next room we were given had a fridge in it, which was very useful and saved a lot of money on food. The pool was nice and my 3-year-old daughter loved the water slide. One complaint I have is the pool slide closed at 8:00 pm, and the playgrounds closed at dusk. We went to the parks in the evening and by the time we were back at the hotel the playgrounds and water slide were closed. Even though the hotel was not very crowded we did hear noise from the adjacent rooms and outside. This wasn\u2019t a real problem for us, but this could be a problem if the hotel was busier. The bus to Magic Kingdom was nice, but we found it quicker and easier for us to drive to all the other parks, since we had our on car.

We booked our tip several weeks ahead and requested a non smoking room, fridge for someone with walking disablities. When we arrived we did not get the room requested and checked in at 4:00pm. We got a smoking room far away and in the inside of unit 2 on the 3rd floor! We called and asked for the room we requested and was told none where availible until the next day and that we needed to call in the morning to confirm we still wanted to move. We did and asked and requested again a room non smoking, and close to pool, bus etc for disability person. Was told they could not give us the room number but it was close to the pool. We packed up and had to have our luggage stored for the day until we returned from the park later in the day. We again went through check in and got our room key. This room was non smoking but was again quite a walk around the inside of the unit #5 not within easy waking from the lobby, bus stop, pool etc. Didnt want to mess with the move again! The next day after our return from the day at the park found our room not vaccumed, no clean glasses in fact was left in the same place as we had used them!, no coffee, table not cleaned and no soap, shampoo etc. All the maid did was make our beds and give us clean towels! I did call and cups, coffee and soap was brought to our room. Next day we pretty much had the same thing no cups but had clean glasses, and one bar of soap and one shampoo for 5 people!. Never say the cute towel animals in our room as this was one of the huge reasons we chose the french quarter for our stay with our kids. Very disappointed! The pool with the slide was a big hit with the kids and was open late but you could not find a towel! sometimes even in the afternoon. The food court closes at 10:00pm so if you happen to catch to stay late at the park by the time you catch your bus back you may only have one option for food. Bus service from the french quarter was excellent! Was always enough room due to being picked up first before riverside. Very friendly. Expect at least a 1/2 ride anywhere you need to go or return.
