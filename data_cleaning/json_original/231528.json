The receptionist really couldn't give a toss but booked us a taxi for hospital. My mother was clearly unwell and distressed & we had to work out which taxi was ours, get to A & E and get sorted. I really couldn't get over how uncaring and disinterested the receptionist was, I was disgusted by her attitude.

The hotel is rated 4*, but I have stayed at better 2* hotels in Paris (Ibis Gare de Lyon, for example). Even we have booked the room as husband and wife, we were offered a separated beds room. The beds had wheels with no locking mechanism. As a consequence, you could drive your bed while sleeping! The beds were moving on the laminated floor, separating all the time from each other. One night we were woke up by a very loud noise above: I think somebody took the chance on really sleeping in such bads and fell on the floor. The room was very small. In the marble bathroom we could find molds on corners and pubic hair from previous guests in the bathtube and the bidet. No shoes polishing sponges (we were given after specifically asking for at the reception). We had to call the management and they replaced the beds with no-wheels beds, but still moving on the slippery laminated floor. They put silicone on the corners growing molds, picked up the pubic hair and even provided us with tooth brushes. Unfortunately, when we come back in the room in the evening we discover the window was not closing. Solving the problem: incredible, the night manager came with a heavy copier paper box and leaned it against the window to help keeping it closed. She said it is all she can do until morning and blamed us for asking too much for a hotel in Barcelona. Anyway we were given a double bed room next day and the stay was acceptable. The breakfast is not so various for a 4* hotel and expensive for what is offering. Very bad coffee. The internet in the lobby is good, but the keyboards are adapted to Spanish and uncomfortable for users of standard English boards. If you make the mistake to stay at this hotel, at least do not make the mistake of asking the reception to call you a cab. They work with the drivers who will drive you around the city for some extra 5 euros and the receptionist gets payed a commission from the taxi company (I overheard them on the walkie-talkie). The location is good. If you leave the hotel, take the metro from downhill (Sagrada Familia); when you come to the hotel get off the up hill station Alfons X. Excellent sushi restaurants in the area. They also serve a variety of Sangria in which they add some sake and the result is extraordinary, the best Sangria you can drink in Barcelona. If you like Toledo swords, you can find a lot on Rambla, at prices 100-200 Euros. Watch out for fake. Best Toledo swords for this money are from manufacturer Marto and bear the mark on the blade. If you pay cash, you will get a 20-30% discount, depending on your negotiating skills. Gorgeous old Gothic Cathedral with the place for the gathering of the noblemen and the garden.

On the other hand however, the majority of rooms appear to be designated as smoking, which obviously results in non-smokers experiencing a rather unpleasant smell. Additionally, a curtain in our room came complete with a hole which looked as though a previous occupier had either inadvertently left it draped over the nearby lamp or burnt it with a cigarette - regardless of which, it badly needed to be replaced. Finally, although the location is fine, to visit Las Ramblas and the waterfront there really is no option other than to make use of public transport unless you wish to spent several hours each day on your feet: the metro is excellent but changing lines can result in a trek of more than half a mile through underground corridors.

Free internet is only in the lobby, and you can use one of 3 computers for free but you have to pay for wi-fi in the rooms.

The lady on reception was friendly and helpfull, the only fault I can really make is the lovely stylish resturant is only for breakfast, you cannot have lunch or an evening meal here. As it was a last minute deal, i booked room only, thinking we could add on food if we wanted to, but you can't, so dont stay here if you want a meal without going out for it. The breakfast was a bit of a rip off, 14 euros each! and to our surprise amongst the usual continental offerings of bread based products, juices and various slices of sausage/meat, we found sweets, like fizzy cola bottles etc, which we thought was most odd, but ate nonetheless. We only gave in to paying the said 14 euros after a fruitless couple of hours scouring the already roasting Barcelona streets in search of some sophisticated breakfast which we couldnt find because most of the cafe's dont open til 10. However, as it was quite late when we went to breakfast , and there was not much food left, we only had to pay for one which was a relief on a budget.

The nearest metro station was 5 mins walk up the road, and i must say it is a great way to get around. its cheap and very clean and easy to navigate. The hotel is a little bit out of the city centre, and so on our return we would chose a different hotel, but really because of the location, and the fact that it doesn't have a pool.

There's no business centre on site, no fitness facilities or pool, and in the rooms there were only a handful of terrestrial channels with very poor reception, all of which were in Spanish. The room was clean, but very small. Especially as there were 3 of us, the extra bed took up so much space that it was very difficult getting from one part of the room to the other! Service at reception was generally very friendly and the staff were helpful, though it felt they were under pressure due to there being not many of them. This was particularly noticeable at breakfast, where there was only waitress trying to clear the tables, replenish breakfast items and various other things. On a positive note, the breakfast was pretty good, and we were happy with the cleanliness of the room, particularly the bathroom. Also, the hotel offered free WiFi access and this worked fine from the lobby. All in all, not a bad stay, but perhaps a little overpriced.

On arrival we were given rooms on the second floor. They stlll had ashtrays in them despite our request for non smoking and smelt strongly of deoderiser - we complained and were moved to ground floor rooms which were basic but clean, but still smelt of deoderiser. I suspect they allow guests to smoke in all the rooms. The staff were pleasant enough but the cleaning staff are determined to use strong cleaning products. One evening we heard them scrubbing the hall carpets outside our rooms with amonia - we had to go out to escape the fumes. They also like things strong in the hotel bar. We requested 2 white coffees which we couldn't drink - they were so strong! I feel this hotel would equate to a 2 or 3 star rating in the UK. All the rooms at the back face a buildings about 10 feet away which are also on a small alleyway down which motorcycles speed long into the night.

The hotel itself is excellent. The rooms are a good size as are the bathrooms. The only problem we had was that you dont have tea and coffee facilities in your room and the bar in reception is only open from 6pm to 11pm. The breakfasts in the morning as lovely, they offer anything from fruit and cereal to cook breakfast all in buffett style. the breakfast is availble from around 8am to 11am. The hotel itself is a bit far out from the main area of barcelona, but there are several restaurants within a ten minute walk to the diagonal area. The \"alfons\" metro is a 5min walk to the top of the street and about 3/4 stops later you are in the \"Gracia\" area which is excellent for shopping. The Las Ramblas area is again about 5mins walk from the Gracia area and is well worth a visit, although watch your wallets and handbags when you are watching the street entertainers. The port olympic is the area I loved the most, a taxi from the hotel to here is about 6euros and the reception staff are more than helpful is ordering and aggreeing a price, although our taxi driver on the first night decided to radio ahead and booked us a table in a very expensive restaurant so be careful of that. He didnt speak mushc english so we werent aware until he pulled up at the hotel as to what he was at. The meal was ovely but very costly. taxis are availble anywhere and everywhere, but you are not allowed to flag them down. The have to be stationary at traffic lights b4 they will allow you to get into them. They are not allowed to stop in taxi/bus lanes or they receive penalty points, but taxi ranks are everywhere. All in all I loved Barcelona and I would stay in the hotel again no problem.

Overall this is a very good choice for the price (we paid around 40 euro each per night for a double room via [--], for three nights - expedia's price was 100 euros more in total). We did not have breakfast. We were not exactly greeted with enthusiasm when we arrived late afternoon; that may be due to a very large group of youngsters arriving at the same time. In any case we were given our room card and assigned a first-floor room looking out onto the street. The bar two doors down unfortunately operates a long-hours policy at weekends and a group of young people sat out on the street until 4 am which was extremely loud. As my fellow traveller insisted on keeping the window open this was a real nuisance, having said that the central a/c worked perfectly and we could have closed the window. Next morning we requested a room looking out the other way and that was no problem at all, despite the hotel being fairly full. This room was very quiet. The hotel is very clean and pleasant to look at, and the rooms were absolutely adequate with a modern and recently refurbished feel to them. The location is also brilliant - rather than the crowded and loud Barri Gotic this is about 15 minutes away from the centre by bus or metro (nearest metro is Alfonso XX, about 200 yards up the hill, and the bus down to town or to the beachfront leaves from directly outside). Sagrada Familia is about 10 mins walk away and there are plenty of small bars to have breakfast in. No complaints, apart from a minor gripe: the staff's English is not great, and they do tend to sound rather abrupt, not to mention rude, because of this. However, they were helpful about our room change and also phoned two restaurants for us to make bookings.", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradford, England", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "CatiePie", "ReviewID": "UR4966964", "Content": "Just arrived back from Barcelona where we stayed at the Bel Art Hotel. Like a previous reviewer we came here by way of one of their other hotels that had problems with the lift. Whilst it is out of town, just up from the Sagredia Familia, the public transport is extremely good. Catch the number 10 bus from just across the road and this will take you straight down to the sea front. Catch the 92 bus it will also take you down to the sea but on a much longer journey. All the bus stops have a name and a map of all the stops on the route. A short walk away is the Alfons (yellow Line) metro stop. My advice is don't take a taxi into the city unless you have to. It cost us 15 euros one night when its only 1.40 euros on public transport. Definately recommend the T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys for 6.35 euros. As long as your journey takes no more than 1.15 hours you can change onto different metro lines; tram; bus and train and it will still be classed as one journey. Fantastic. We felt extremely safe in this area. Recommend the bar next door to the hotel. There is a tapas bar a bit further down called Bar Teatre. (closed Sunday and Monday evenings) Lovely food - got a sandwich for lunch one day with a tortilla filling. Sounds strange but it's very good. Taxi from the airport cost 31 euros a bit steep but it was our first time in Barcelona and when we return we will be using the T10 tickets to get across on the airport bus and then the metro. Though difficult negotiating steps with all your baggage. Not every station has an escalator. The taxi drivers always have the meter running when they are pre-booked be warned. The hotel does a menu of the day at a very good price of 12 euros for three courses including bread and a glass of wine. Food was lovely. Plenty of choice. NB: Restaurant is closed on Saturday and Sunday evenings. Also breakfasts were excellent - a mixture of sweet and savoury which would suit all tastes Watch out for pick pockets but don't let it put you off. Be particularly careful on busy trains/metro I would be happy to recommend this hotel. The staff all speak English and they are very helpful and friendly.

We were advised before arrival to get a taxi from the airport but if you know the location of your hotel get the airport bus which is very cheap, very frequent and goes right into the centre of Barcelona to the square at Catalunya - you can get a bus or Metro from there if necessary. The Bel Art hotel is situated in a quiet, clean district where I felt very safe, and is just a few minutes from Alfons X metro station on the yellow line. The hotel was extremely clean, despite the fact that redecoration was in progress during our stay. No view from the window, but we didn't go to Barcelona to sit on a hotel balcony. Our room was thoroughly cleaned every day, including clean sheets on the comfortable bed and clean towels in the bathroom. Downside was the room safe did not work, more coat hangers would have been useful and TV was not satellite but Spanish channels, a couple of German channels plus CNN and BBC World with very bad reception. Single film on offer was pay per view as were more adult offerings. The breakfast was a veritable feast with something for every one with savoury and sweet, hot and cold, frequently and discreetly replenished by staff. All staff were very helpful and interacted very well in English. Reception staff always willing to help with everything from directions to the loan of a mobile phone recharger. Overall impression was clean and comfortable and I would recommend to anyone not bothered about being a little out of town.
