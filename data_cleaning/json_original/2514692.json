It was a late evening when I arrived to JFK . I had called the hotel the day before just to advise my very late arrival . I took a cab to hotel and was very tired because of a long flight. There was nobody in the reception .I waited a while then a lady came . I gave my passport and reservation documents to have my room key . She then made her words which had shocking effect on me . she said that no rooms were available at that time. I showed her my booking which had done via booking.com. She could not find any word to say , just told me that they did a mistake because their system were blocked or something. They sent me another hotel close to that region. It was an awful night experience . I spent that night in a very small room like a bird nest then found another hotel (crowne plaza)and moved to there the day after.

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted with a warm friendly welcome from the reception staff. They explained the facilities and sent us on our way. The room was great, really different from the norm which was refreshing. The bed sat under the window on a sort of plinth that you had to step up on to and walk around to get to the far side. It was cool. The modern wash facilities were in the room under a large mirror. The toilet was behind a sliding door and beyond that the large shower space and rain drop shower. The branded toiletries were nice and we had bathrobes too. I used the pool and steam room. The pool is a great place to chill with mood lighting. It had a log fire projected on to the wall above the pool. The staff were really good at check out too.

I love the unique boutique hotels the city offers so I did a lot of research before settling on a Bunk Bed room at the Room Mate Grace. I was very happy with my choice! We are both in our 20's, which I'm pretty sure is the main demographic for this hotel. The hotel itself is in a really great location, about one block off of Times Square. There really isn't a standard lobby area, it's more like a concession stand but that didn't bother me because I know everything in NYC is always crammed into very little space. While walking to the elevators you get a glimpse of the indoor pool which is really cute and chic! There's a bar on the other side of the pool, with a glass window that you can order drinks from inside the water. There's also a steam room and sauna located next to the pool. The pool bar closed at 2 (or 3 - I forget), but the pool was open 24 hours a day. Each floor has some really colorful funky wallpaper which gives the place a fun feel. When we entered the room it was definitely small, but I expected that. There was a big counter with a sink and fridge. Then a large stand up shower and separate toilet area to the right. To the left was the king size bed with a twin size bunk over top of it. Everything looked very modern and new. The hotel offered free WiFi to guests, which was simple to hook up to and worked well for me the entire trip. We had a large window in the room which looked out to the side of a brick building - again, typical NYC. My only complaint was that the neighboring building was having extensive renovations done while we were there and we were woke up at 6 am to the sound of machinery and jack hammers. Overall the price of the hotel was very reasonable, which I was happy about. The hotel itself does not have parking but they have an arrangement with a local garage to give discounted parking. I would definitely consider the Room Mate Grace again for an overnight trip to NYC.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "OhioGhh", "ReviewID": "UR126695578", "Content": "Spent a couple of nights in this hotel with my 2 daughters (both in their 20s).

They have a swim up bar and a small lounge. It gets ridiculously busy on weekends. (Pool parties) Cons: The size. It is small. Think European Chic.

The rooms are small yes, but they are nice and we were not there to hang out in the room. The best part of our room was the shower which was very big and hot. Our room was clean and the bed was very nice. Just my wife and I were up in NYC for the weekend so we didn't need a lot of space. Our rate was okay but 2 days before leaving the rate dropped on another site hotels.com would not match the price due to a policy with Room Mate Grace they claimed. We arrived a little before check in time but the folks at the front desk were able to get us a room that had just been serviced. This was a nice little perk considering we were a little tired and just wanted to rest for a few then get on to enjoying NYC. I would love to stay here again, I just hope to get the room for a price around $200, this time I paid $234 - $260.

Lots of places to eat in the area too. We really didn't do much in the area we just really wanted to stay in a central location near the subway that we could drop stuff off easily.

And I guess the bottom line is that the managment of this hotel knows how ridiculous the noise level is but choose to keep the club opened despite the impact on the hotel guests. My brother and his wife stayed on the 10th floor and were not affected at all by noise.

Nonetheless, I really did not feel comfortable in this hotel, despite the fact there was nothing that was done \"wrong\" in particular. We stayed at Room Mate Grace during our anniversary. We chose this hotel in particular due to several reasons: 1. it was our anniversary and the hotel looked really chic and trendy on the concierge's web site (one we often used to use, but no longer will, therefore no point in sharing the name); 2. Location; 3. Good reviews else where; 4. Gym We were upgraded by the hotel staff when we told them that it was our anniversaries. What did go wrong then? The following: 1. The room that we were upgraded into was still very small. So, I do not want to think about the look of the standard room. 2. No duvet cover! In fact, there is only a white sheet that has been folded over the duvet itself. I tried not to ruin our holiday by complaining over or thinking too much about it; but God knows who else used that duvet before... 3. There is a club downstairs next to the lobby... And, on one Saturday night, I'm afraid the bodyguards almost asked for our IDs as we tried to make it to the elevators to go to sleep. 4. Gym: Two broken bicycles in a sqm box. Some dumbless and a flabby swiss ball. Nothing else. Not even a treadmill. 5. Pool: is used for DJ parties, so I wouldn't want to swim in that same pool later on. I guess the problem might be with me as well, but I do not like the so-called \"trendy\" hotels. All they do is color the elevators, use funky wall-papers and carpeting to look trendy. to me with a disco downstairs, the hotel no longer feels that safe and I really do not enjoy the fact that cleanliness is forsaken for the sake of trendiness...", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBring ear plugs if you actually want to sleep!\u201d", "Author": "DebbieEF60713", "ReviewID": "UR122324432", "Content": "Horrible place to stay unless you're more interested in a party than a quiet room!

I tried hard. Unfortunately, the only thing this place had going for it is location - 1/2 block from Time Square. Customer Service: very disorganized. Appalling. The left hand doesnt seem to know what the right hand is up to. We had 4 adults and 4 children with us. We reserved 2 quad bunk rooms about 4 months in advance. We stored our luggage at about 10:30 and were assured our rooms would be ready promptly at 3 PM. After touring the city we had some very tired, small children. And adults! We arrived at the hotel at 3:30 finding that only one room was ready. The other would be ready in \"20 minutes\". Well repeat this scenario for another 2 hours. We repeatedly called checking on the status of the other room. Each time we talked to someone different and were given a different story. It was ready and the key was being sent up. 30 minutes later oh it's not ready it's still being cleaned. 20 minutes later it's being checked by housekeeping and we're bringing the key to you now. At 5:30 I stormed downstairs ready to check out completely. The two at the front desk acted as though this was all brand new information, they argued about what room we were to have, and then assured us the key was being sent up. I demanded a key in my hand before I left that desk or I was checking out completely. Needless to say I received the key and we went up to our room, after demanding a lower rate as well. Also, everyone had very thick accents. Which is fine, I have no issue with that...but not one single American is employed by this hotel in any regard...? Seems a bit strange an makes me wonder about their business practices. Rooms: clean but in need of repair. The wallpaper is gashed and peeling. The carpet is worn. The TVs are mismatched and broken. Lights broken. Requested that a broken light and tv be repaired - neither were. Asked again and were told it takes several days to put in a \"work order\"...? Stayed 2 days and never addressed further. The shower is all tile and while clean, the grout is stained. Also, beware that only a thin shower curtain Seperates the shower from the rest of the room. Kinda weird. The beds are comfy. But know this room is functional and that's all. Noise: be aware this hotel has a club scene and plays bass laden music until about 3 am 5 days a week. Problematic for lower floors. Overall: if you plan on just sleeping in your hotel while NYC the RMG will probably suffice. It's not a luxury hotel. It's not even a fun boutique. Another reviewer said its more like a hostel and I agree. But the location is excellent and for the price you probably won't find better in that regard. I think the RMG may have been neat and fun at one time but it is in swrious need of an overhaul in both appearance and customer service. So if you can live with a lipsticked pig, the RMG is probably for you.

From the check-in counter (where they sell drinks behind the cashier) to the area next to the lifts (where you enter into the bar area at night) before you go up to your room, we felt like we were in a scaled down version of a bar, although a chic one because you can see an indoor pool by bar area from where you are waiting for the lift. The room itself (wife and I had a deluxe room) was pretty decent and comfortable. Mattress a little soft and bouncy but ok. Right next door, they are building something from the ground up so in the mornings until evenings, there is quite a bit of noise especially of construction people shouting to each other. No noise from heavy type equipment but enough to wake you from 7 am. From look of things, construction is likely to go on for at least another 6 to 9 months. I think on lower floors, you can hear clubbing type music (quite faint though) whilst you are lying in bed, until like 3 am. You can only watch TV from the bed (not seating area). Free wireless was a bonus. We got the room for 4 nights from a room broker after researching for several weeks. Had a good deal on the deluxe room.

I called a few days early and requested an early check-in and my room was ready as requested at 10 am. The check-in was smooth and easy. The room was \"porn-like\"....in my opinion very modern and chic...perfect for a single urban-traveler. However, it was VERY small and contained VERY little storage. I couldn't imagine having my spouse or a fellow traveler to share the room with. The beds were like a fluffy cloud...very comfy...and I mean one of the best hotel beds I have EVER slept in. The was a problem with the cable. It seemed (told to me via an employee) that the hotel had forgotten to pay the cable bill and numerous channels in the hotel tv lineup were disconnected. This was never resolved during my stay. The breakfast each morning was very good. A bit pricey at $13 per morning...but a great selection of food and served until 10. The pool, sauna & steam room were wonderful. The pool was a bit cool...but very nice. The only BIG problem that I had was the in-room internet. I was in NYC on business and needed to access my offices via internet remote access. After four - five calls to the internet service tech....the internet issues were left unresolved. The techs' responses were...\"it seems to be a signal issue and we can't fix that\". The problem with this was ....when the signal was actually being broadcast....it was registering on my laptop at 4/5 bars....so there was adequate signal. I angerily left an entire week's worth of emails and problems to my assistant to tackle without much oversight. Location was wonderful. 5 Irish Pubs within a 30-second walk, Great vendor food carts, 1 block from Times Square, 1 block from 6th Ave, and very short walk to Rock. Center. Would I stay here again?

All through our trip, the steam room was out of service and had been even days Before we actually arrived but the 'lovely' receptionists could not be bothered to give the hotel guests any notice of this! Furthermore, the 'double bed' that was offered in our room was as tiny as they come! Pretty shocking, considering how expensive the room was.

The staff, yet again, were totally useless in providing any information as to why that happened or to even apologise for the hideous and unecessary noise. Basically, if you want good customer service, well sized rooms for a bargain And a fully-functioning spa, DO NOT STAY AT Room Mate Grace!

It mentioned that it is better to get a room on a higher floor because noise from the bar/pool area can be a problem late at night. Our original room was lower. We asked and we were put on the 14th floor. It was quiet. The review was true because when we came home from the theatre the bar area was hopping and one could hear the noise on the 2nd floor. I assume the 3rd floor might have had the same problem. By and large it is a younger crowd who stays at the hotel but there were other age groups. For NYC we found the prices reasonable and the room very comfy and fun. The location can't be beat. The front desk staff will also arrange a private car with tip included to the airport (in our case, LaGuardia) for $50.00. It was worth it. It is a little more than a taxi but a good deal.

Other than the location being convenient, I don't have any other good things to say of this hotel. Management here seems to be more focused on running a club rather than a hotel. While staying less than two days, I encountered three incidents which left me very dissatisfied. First, when we were in need of a towel, we called the lobby requesting some. A card states to leave your old towels by the door to receive new ones. Within minutes the old towels were gone but never received any new ones. After some time, we called again asking for the towels which we were told \"they're on the way\". After about 45 minutes, we ran out of patience and were forced to dry ourselves with a hand towel. Finally after coming home hours later we see that our room was cleaned and towels replaced. Then we requested for a dress to be dry cleaned. We were told we couldn't leave it with the concierge and had to return to our room to fill out a form instead. We were already running late and they still wouldn't hold the dress for us. In addition, there was never any form at our room to begin with! We skipped that process and proceeded with our night. Finally, after returning later that evening we asked for a form to request the dry cleaning service again. We did not ask for overnight service, and were told the regular time would have the dress back by 7pm which was fine. The fee, as stated on the form, was to be $23. We had the dress returned to us at about noon and were actually impressed with the service.. so we thought. Upon checkout, we were in need of catching a train and needed to check out quickly. We were told we had to wait because the \"computers were down\". After making us late and causing us to wait longer, they finally had the nerve to charge us $45 or the dry cleaning. Since I didn't have time to waste, I showed how disgusted I was with the charge yet paid just to be on my way. Which then came to $49 after tax. So altogether, $50 to simply dry clean a dress.

Outside of the Mandarin Oriental, the Peninsula and the like -- hotel rooms are smallish compared to many other major city - and certainly US cities. The 5 Start hotels are gonna break your budget and are only for those with lavish expense accounts or considerable means. Myself, I always seek out the quirky, boutique hotels - I generally appreciate the decor, ambiance and experience more. In this regard, I don't think the Grace disappoints. Taxes included (which are substantial in NYC) was $290/night for 4 nights. If your hotel is under the $250-300 range in NYC your experience is likely to be crappy and disappointing. The Grace's rooms are \"smallish\" - -but larger than rooms I've had at the Hudson (tiny!!!!), Paramount, Time, Night, Tribeca Grand, Thompson and SoHo Grand hotels -- and for the price, I think a real value. They are well designed and thought-out. Plenty of space for storage. I stayed in a corner room and the bed was raised on a platform with generous storage beneath for luggage. The linens, pillows and comforter were plush and comfy. Framed by windows on the head and side of the bed, the room actually had a light and airy feel. Decor is otherwise minimalist, but functional. Everything was clean and in working order. Bathroom is exceptionally roomy -- although I stayed alone on this trip, the bathroom had a double sink with an expansive 8 foot counter -- plenty of room to spread out your necessities, even with a traveling companion. No bath, but the shower was enormous, an open plan design separated only by a curtain from the rest of the bathroom. Bit of a problem with the heavy shower spray not draining fast enough and water pooling and inching out of the shower inclosure - but not really a big deal. As noted, the lobby/bar of the hotel also has an indoor pool floating at \"eye-level\", and at night it's a small club of sorts -- DJ, loud music, etc. -- very youngish crowd. It's a lively scene -- I didn't hear a peep of noise in my room on the 8th floor, but maybe it's an issue if you're on a lower floor. I'm not sure who the hotel's base clientele is -- looked a bit fashion and a lot of younger, European tourists. I tried it because of my familiarity with the Roommate hotels in Madrid, Spain (and a friend has decorated them all - so disclosure there). Staff completely professional and friendly, absolutely no issues -- didn't give it a 5 star because it's simply not a 5-star hotel, but I thought given the location and comfort, it's an excellent value for what it is and you'll not likely be disappointed. A particularly good location for first timers to NYC who will do all the traditional touristy things.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazing location in a great hotel at a great price!e\u201d", "Author": "missejb", "ReviewID": "UR113971655", "Content": "I stayed at hotel grace for 4 nights in may 2011 for my birthday.

The flights was with British Airways and were comfortable and onece at the other end we paid 12 dollas each to get on the bus which takes you to your nearest point near your hotel, ours was about a ten minute walk away from the hotel which was fine. We managed to find Room mate Grace down a side turning which was a ten minute walk from time square which was amazing. Such a fantastic city alot like London and easy to find places due to the block system. Arrived at the hotel and as soon as you walk in the staff are friendly and welcoming and were so helpful. The hotel was very clean and looked very smart considering it was a threee star i have stayed in five stars that were not up to this standards. once in our room i was surprised that i could not hear that much noise as we were facing the front of the road. the bed was so comfortable one of the best i have ever slept in and lovely fluffy pillow which is what you want when you do a walking tour. The bedroom was small but there was enough space for me and my husband and it was cosy and very clean. the shower was always hot and very smart. We had a petite room which over looked the main road at the front and even though we were next to a pub we herd the music once but nothing that ear plugs didnt keep out. we had booked to have breakfast in the hotel and it was a continental breakfast which was all fresh and plenty of food , the seating area was comfortable and clean and again the staff in the restaurant were so friendly and helpful, never had to wait to get a seat and it over looked the pool area which was amazing and a plus for a NYC hotel. I really cant recommend this hotel enough it was for me an amazing holiday in NYC and enjoyed and loved every part of it. The room had an ipod dock which was also an alarm which came in handy in your room, the hotel also had internet acess in the lobby. I visited many attractions while here and managed to do a list of things while in the Big Apple. i would highly recommend would be NYC tours it was one of the most amazing trips i had ever done on any holiday i have been on. This included a private tour guide who was amazing and had fantastic knowledge on the city i managed to take the sub way the bus and go to Harlem and see the real New York, we walked to many parts of NYC and foun this amazing and made it easy for us to find our way around the city throughout our holiday. We had dumplings in china town and got a real insight of how New yorker live!, this was amazing this tour was about \u00a3350.00 but was truly worth the whole experience our tour guide was Lawrence who lived in Queens and we literally walked from 10 am till 6.30 pm that night it was amazing we saw the whole of the city and was more than we could have ever have dreamed of. WE also went on the staten island ferry didnt go up to the statue of liberty but was not really fussed about doing so, u can see it really close on the ferry and go quiet near it to. We also went to the Rockerfella centre and done top of the rock and went up to the empire state building the views were amazing. i can not wait to revist the city as its a place where i could visit time and time again, i was quiet disapointed with the shopping especially woodbury common i did manange to get some DKNY jeans for six pound each which was amazing but the clothing was very american . Also found that the designer shoes were cheaper in london than here even though the uggs were alot cheaper here than in london. I would highly recommend this hotel and the tours this was an amazing experience, we ate in an italian called Bella Vita which was just off of times square it was cheap huge portions friendly staff and always got you a table was something out of good fellas the best pizza and italian i have had ate here every day pratically for dinner it was so lovely.

I stayed in a deluxe room in a corner of the building (but unfortunately the room was not that bright). The bed was raised and comfortable, allowing you to store your luggage underneath it. The only difference between this and a standard room appears to be the fact that some Deluxe rooms have a king size bed and may be a bit bigger. The other furniture in the room consisted of a small round table (which was moveable) and a chair, and wardrobe space was included behind a curtained area. The bathrooms are a bit different to other hotels, with the sink accompanied by a large counter top, and is not closed off from the rest of the room. There was a waterfall shower in a spacious booth (there are no bathtubs in the hotel) and a toilet which share a sliding door (separated from the sink). The bathroom amenities were: bath gel, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, soap, shower cap, shoe shine, bath robes and hair dryer. Other amenities include an empty fridge, an iPod dock and a safe large enough to store a laptop. Additionally, you can control the temperature with an electronic thermostat. NB, there is no room service or tea/coffee making facilities, although the room guide does have some suggested restaurants nearby.

I did use the sauna, but the controls weren't very clear so I couldn't adjust the heat level and there were no instructions on how to initiate the steam room. Beware that the \"free breakfast\" is not included with all rates, which is confusing as when you visit their website, it suggests that it is free, but maybe you only get it if you book directly through their website rather than via an online travel website.

The toilet stall is in a separate room besides the shower and that was the only place that contained 2 wall hooks. A few more hooks would've been great. One negative we did experience was how the heating system worked. The vent is situated right above the bunks. The 2 beds beside the window were always cold as it appeared to be coming from the windows. So we cranked up the heat, but it took so long to activate that by the time the heat came around, the kids were super hot (as they were sleeping in the bunks) and the ladder railing was burning hot!

The breakfast items is always very fresh and very nicely presented. We travelled with a total of 21 people (5 families) in which there were 11 kids (ages 6 to 13).

But, overall everyone else was helpful and nice. They are a little understaffed at check in, etc. and rooms are not typically available early. Be patient, it is still a deal for NYC. - Noise: there is a rollicking disco/night club scene that happens here on Weekends and select weeknights. Some of the stuff that goes on is a bit nuts. If you are a prude, go elsewhere. It does get noisy though, so a room higher up is much better. - Overall: very funky find in mid-town NYC. I am a local and have stayed all over NYC in many different hotels. I thought this was a great deal if you are looking for funk and style on a budget.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel\u201d", "Author": "oasis1180", "ReviewID": "UR101745907", "Content": "The hotel is new, clean, modern and beautiful.

The hotel may look small on outward appearance, but the hotel is anything but! Upon entrance, one is met with a neuvo-mod style reminiscent of the European Spanish culture. The wallpaper and decor are busy, but it works! It certainly appeals to the stylish culture of NYC. We stayed on the 11th floor, and this was probably the worst feature of the hotel...the decor or that particular level. Each floor has it's own unique style...all very London 50's-esque...like walking into an Austin Powers movie, yet all are very tastefully done...except for the 11th floor it seems. Just a warning, if anyone is extremely drunk and dizzy, stepping out onto the 11th will definitely cause one to upchuck from the sheer and unbelievably bright, obnoxious and busy print of the walls. But once past that, the entrance into the premium rooms (the largest of all accommodations) are well worth it. Studio layout, the rooms are spacious, stylish and very clean. Again, as the lobby is, the rooms are very fitting for that modern city lifestyle, and if one truly wants to feel immersed in the NYC flavor, this hotel does convict one accordingly. Check out the brand \"Custo Barcelona\" because the rooms seem as if they are a spin-off of this clothing style. Some of the downfalls were the parking...parking is very affordable...$25 per night (great rate in the city), but the parking facilities are located one block over from the restaurant. Also, don't rely on the bellhop to bring your suitcases to your room. This particular position is short staffed, so it's more efficient to bring your bags to the room. Since most reservations come with the complimentary breakfast, don't take that as a complement. The breakfast was limited, as it was just complimentary, but the cold cuts and cheeses are comparable to those found in the cheese section of your local food market where the individually wrapped cheeses are a staple here.

Our stay overall was great. The location is great, right in the heart of Times Square and the Theatre District! We arrived before check in and they agreed to store our bags and upgraded our room for free! The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms were small, which is very typical for NYC, but were nice. The bathrooms were very odd. The shower head comes off the ceiling and there is a drain in the center of the bathroom, but there is no actual enclosed shower. There is no shower curtain or door, you just stand in the middle of the bathroom to take a shower....which took the first few showers to get used to! It was a problems b/c everything gets wet and no one can really be in the bathroom to get ready or use the bathroom while someone else is showering! The only 2 complaints we had were 1) the lighting, which was not great in the actual hotel room and getting ready and putting on make up in the bathroom was not an option until everyone was done showering and 2) the noise from the pool/club at night. The pool turns into a club at night and we were on the 4th floor and could hear the music and bass in the room every night. It went until 1-2 am every night, and on the nights we were exhausted from being on the go all day, it was slightly irritating! And the best part of our stay.....we found no evidence of bed bugs which was a HUGE relief!!!

I'll keep the review nice and simple: Pros - central location, very clean throughout entire hotel, nice small size (compared to huge inpersonal Hilton types), brilliant to have pool/sauna/steam room, very comfortable beds and bedding, interesting shop in reception to stock up mini fridge, helpful/knowledgable staff, good sized bathroom and shower (wet room) Cons - appalling wireless internet connection in certain rooms (we stayed in two different rooms - 906 had a poor connection and 1204 was excellent), rooms on smallish size for the US, bar was always closed during the day and only open one of the evenings Summary: a good quality hotel situated in an excellent location from which to explore the main attractions of NY. Fantastic facilities include a small spa; however, be careful if wifi is important to you - it may be worth swapping rooms if needed. PS. Make sure you pop around the corner to visit Jimmy's Corner on W 44th - a really good value bar with nice vibe and friendly staff.

It was a busy route as it takes you through times square, so if you have a lot of luggage get a cab. The best best best thing about this hotel is the location.

Breakfast was included- continental buffet (breads, bagels, croissants, cereal, fruit, tea, coffee, juice). If its included in your stay its great, if not it is not worth $10 dollars. Go to cranberry cafe (left out of hotel). Great little deli with amazingly fresh food and cheap prices.

The photos on the website make the hotel look very chic, but the reality is rather more prosaic. First the good points. It's a very good location, and the staff are pleasant and helpful. The room was very clean and fairly well insulated from the noise of the city, so you can get a good night's sleep. They serve breakfast till late (11am weekdays, noon weekends) so if you like a lie-in after a strenuous night on the town that's good (though it's only a cold buffet, no hot breakfasts as far as I could see). The crticisms aren't serious, more in the nature of mild disappointment. For example, one factor that influenced me to book was the swimming pool - except it isn't!. It looks great on the pix, but in fact it's pretty small and a uniform depth of 3' 9\", which is really more like a large paddling pool. Don't get me wrong, it's pleasant enough to splash around in but a proper swimming pool it is not. There's also nowhere to get changed to swim, so you either have to change in your room and travel up and down the elevator in your swimwear, or use the loo near the bar and hope nobody pinches your clothes while you're swimming. The pool is also very much overlooked. The fact that it's next to the bar may be good if you want a drink, but it also means that you are subject to the scrutiny of New York's finest, and in such an image-conscious city you may feel that you're not quite as perfectly-honed as they would want - you'ill certainly be breathing in when you exit the pool, that's for sure! Another slightly annoying aspect is that the room lighting is quite dim, even on max. Whoever took the website pix certainly used extra lighting. The room facilities are quite basic - there's a fridge, but no minibar (though as I never use them anyway this didn't bother me). And there's no plug for the washbasin, though if you put the water glass over the plughole and fill it with water it works quite well. The shampoo etc comes in little square, rigid containers that seem to be unique to Grace. This is a PITA, as you can't squeeze it out, you have to smack its bottom till it reluctantly emerges! And I couldn't get the wi-fi to work, though this may be because I was trying to use it with an iPhone. I could get connected to the service provider (Roomlinx?) but although it said `You are connected to the internet\" as soon as I tried to access the internet it cut off. As I said, this could be just an issue with an iPhone, but the help number on the Roomlinx link was out of service, and the front desk staff didn't have clue. In any event, why does it have to be so complicated? Everywhere else just has a straightforward wi-fi zone, so why not here? I ended up having to pay to use the internet access in the lobby, which entirely defeats the purpose. NOT impressed with this aspect of the deal. And finally the price. As usual with US hotels, the headline rate is just the start, and after all the taxes etc were added the bill came out at just over $250 a night. Whilst this may not of itself be very expensive for the location I felt it was quite a lot for a pleasant, but not fantastic hotel.

While chatting about our stay, two Hotel Grace employees surprised me a great deal. The woman behind the lobby desk and the gentleman who stowed our luggage for us (for the day) both were quite unprofessional regarding the previous evening. The two employees gossiped about the clientele from the night before in a very uncomplimentary manner. Among other comments, the female attendant told us that \"half the guests complained about last night.\" I asked, quite genuinely, why. The male attendant snarked, \"WHY? You'd have to be blind to not know what was going on last night.\" He then went on to express his personal disgust in the appearance of the bar guests (or in his words, the \"polar bears\"). Confiding one's personal views to a coworker is one thing, but bashing the bar guests in front of hotel guests was distasteful. I was unimpressed by their lack of tact and unprofessionalism. A third employee, a woman behind the desk, was also present but did not participate in the discussion. Besides the gay bashing, the hotel was adequate, but did not impress me in any way. Customer service was lacking. After we checked in, we notified the front desk about a broken light bulb, and the front desk attendant was curt in her response. Maybe I'm being unfair.

Reception staff were very welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. We were grateful for the unexpected upgrade on our room. A nice touch! I chose RMG initially for the pool but in fact didn't use it: it's too small for my usual morning swim but suits the purpose of a bar area, I suppose! We didn't brave the sauna or steam room either. I'm sure they're ok but it was pretty cold outside so we were glad to be warm and keep our clothes on when indoors. I wonder if the pool is really necessary: rarely anyone in there and perhaps a huge management expense for such little use? Everything else about RMG was excellent. I was impressed with the cleanliness: the excellent quality towels and bed linen were changed every day if you wished. The rooms were thoroughly cleaned daily. The cleaning staff were unobtrusive and very pleasant. The beds were very comfortable, if a little awkward to negotiate in the middle of the night. Whilst I would subscribe to the cosy, romantic, plush decor of a traditional home, I like a hotel room to be chic and minimal: it's not so easy to hide the dust and dirt in a modern interior. I hate the idea of having to leave the hotel to have breakfast: a common feature of NY hotels so RMG suited us fine. My day doesn't start until I've had my morning fix. The breakfast was fantastic. We loved the informality and really appreciated the variety of healthy choices and so much of it. We never had a problem with seating (you could take your breakfast to your room if you wished, there were trays available). I would be unhappy if the hotel management sacrificed the quality and quantity of the food available for the sake of a few extra chairs and tables! Lots of blueberries and raspberries on my cereal....what a luxury that was. And my first (not my last) cinnamon and raisin bagel! Wow! My husband is coeliac and as soon as I mentioned this to the lovely lady 'in charge' of the breakfast area, she dispatched a colleague to the nearest shop for gluten free cerals! That's never happened before and we were SO impressed. There were other special touches which we didn't really take advantage of: the tea/coffee machine was available all the time in the breakfast/eating area AND you were invited to order take-aways from the menus of various restaurants included in the hotel's information file in the room and eat them either in your room or in the breakfast area, using the hotels' cutlery etc.. How accommodating is that?!? The location was excellent for our needs and, because I took the advice from other 'trip advisor' reviewers, I contacted the hotel staff inadvance and requested quiet rooms. No problem!

We took the elevator up to the 10th floor, and our first impression was that the hotel looked a bit \"motel-like\" with neon orange lighting, but do not be deceived. Our room was compact but very well designed with little storage areas under the bed, had plasma tv, dvd player, ipod docking station, telephone, aircon, iron, hairdryer, self-stockable mini bar, and wetroom with separate toilet. The room was well maintained and we had clean towels daily. The bed was just the most comfortable bed ever and was suspended higher than the windows so we looked down on crazy NYC from the comfort of our duvet! The hotel offered us continental breakfast (we thought we were room only basis), and it was yummy...pastries both sweet and savory, fresh fruit, cereals, eggs, tea, coffee, toast, juices etc. And this was served from 06.00-12.00! The pool was a really lovely touch to soothe the aching feet after sightseeing...our only complaint would be that the temperature needed bringing up a few degrees! There was a sauna and steam room too! The pool are was clean, had music playing, a swim-up bar, and twinkly lights...we honestly felt this was a part of the hotel that many guests missed the enjoyment of, but couldn't understand why??!!

As I was staying at the Grace, I joked w/ my friends that it feels like a \"V Hotel\"; it's trying to be like the W but it comes up just short in style, comfort and overall vibe. However, for the price and location, Grace is an incredible value. You are literally in the middle of the Theater District in Times Square and only 15 blocks from Central Park, which is about a 15 minute walk. So you save that much more money by avoiding cabs and the subway b/c everything is pretty much in walking distance. To a degree, you are getting what you pay for: location, location, location. The rooms however, are tiny and construction is going on next door. If you are a light sleeper like me, then make sure you bring earplugs and sleeping pills. I was on the 12th floor by request, and I needed to buy those creature comforts to get a good night's sleep. I do regret not taking advantage of the swimming pool bar. Guys, if you're traveling alone, this is a killer place to stay. Lots of gorgeous women running around in the pool for private parties and DJ theme nights. It was very tempting to cancel my plans and stay at the hotel bar for Brazilian Night, trust me. For you biz travelers, the internet connection is spotty at best. Don't think you'll get a ton of work done in your room...there's hardly any space to do so and the internet connection runs hot and cold. Overall, if you're single, in your 20s and early 30s and want a W-like experience but don't want to pay $400 a night for it, stay here. Especially if you like a European-style atmosphere that almost feels like a very high-end youth hostel. If you're traveling with someone and seeking a romantic quiet weekend at a nice hotel, go someplace else. This is a hip, young establishment and you'll be annoyed at the loudness and hub-bub. All in all, I'm glad I stayed at Room Mate Grace. But, all things being equal, as a single 35-year-old w/ disposable income...in the future I'll pay the extra money for the added comfort and quiet of a nicer hotel experience. I prefer class to grit at this point in my life.

The continental breakfast was very nice; a buffet of bagels, sandwich fixings, croissants, fresh fruit, muffins and doughnuts. OJ and excellent coffee. A room with a king size bed and twin upper bunk was perfect for the 3 of us. The only drawback for us would've been the see-through shower curtain for the shower, since there is no door to close b/w the shower area and the rest of the room. I'd advise you bring a few clothespins and pin a bed sheet to the see-through curtain. We simply only used it after swimming, with our bathing suits still on. Very conveniently located in theater district/Times Square area. Also, there are cafe-type restaurants--very casual, right near the hotel.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "MINNEAPOLIS, MN", "Title": "\u201cInteresting hotel\u201d", "Author": "TRAVELINGMINNEAPOLIS", "ReviewID": "UR46392341", "Content": "I really liked the location of this hotel.

We had few drinks at the lounge bar on Sunday. The bartender was very friendly and polite. By the way, most of the other quests seemed to be Spanish speaking. Also the staff spoke Spanish. There were some little thing that could have been better: One of the two elevators was broken twice during our week's stay. Our keys didn't work our last whole day there. Mistakes happen, but the thing that bothered me was that when asking to fix them, the staff member didn't apologized. It also took a while to get our bags from the luggage room, since there was only one staff member doing that and there were few other quests leaving at the same time.

Great location as you are in the thick of the hive of activity that is Times Square and Broadway. Firstly I've got to say, forget about the pictures on their website as the rooms in reality are perhaps not as 'plush' as the impression you are given when you see those pictures. We initially had booked a standard room, we were given an upgrade! but the upgraded room was 'cosy', i.e. small, so I would have loved to see the size of the 'standard' we had originally booked. Double bed, sort of up on a height, you''vve got to climb up to it. Open bathroom, i.e. no door. Large good shower and toilet, clean towels. all fine. No baths. Open closet for hanging clothes. A TV. That's basically it. An Iron and a hairdryer. No tea/coffee, no minibar (drinks at reception, expensive!!) Room was clean, it was fine for us as we were out and about all day every day. Noisy air conditioning and noisy if you open the window. Hotel is 70's retro style. Pool/bar area is lively, they hold parties every wed night. If you want some quite make sure you ask for a room up high, we stayed on the 9th floor and couldn't hear a thing, it was perfect. Brekkie included in the price (which is rare) - croissants, pastries, cereals, bagels, toast, fruit, yoghurt, hard boiled egg and juices. It was fine for starting the day. Internet access available for $5 for 30 mins. Just to let you know - at least 5 amounts of tax added to our bill, occupancy tax, unit tax, state tax......... its standard. and the drinks are expensive!

I have no complaints. I paid $1460 for RT flight from San Francisco (SFO) to JFK plus seven nights at RMG. Great location -- very near Times Square/theatre district. Great free breakfast buffet -- yogurt, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, bagels, mini-croissants, raspberries, blueberries, apples, oranges, coffee and a great lattes from the self-serve latte machine. I took a bagel and fruit with me for lunch, making it a free breakfast and lunch. The hosts/hotel employees were nice and accommodating. The only service I received directly was getting help with my bags to my room on the 10th floor, where I gave my only tip, $2.00. The pool and sauna were wonderful, when it wasn't party night. The pool is open to non-guests after 5pm and organized parties (of non-guests) for a fee. This was not a big problem except for when they wanted to close the sauna one night. I arrived before the party, which started at 10pm, and was able to swim. The steam room has a slippery floor so I would exercise caution if you use it. Music at the pool area is much louder during parties, but lower otherwise, which I prefer. The decor was strange. The hotel's wallpaper is a striking bright orange with a floral pattern. The lighting throughout RMG is dim/low. It's hard to see the buttons in the elevator due to the low lighting. My room was also designed in a trendy way. The wallpaper is similarly strange and there's this hilarious double-teardrop light fixture that you'll have to see to believe. Another strange thing is the 'bench board' surrounding the bed, which I didn't like, but got used to. The thing about trendy design is that you should do a makeover every two years. RMG is due. One irritation I\u2019d like to mention is the television. This small non-HD flat screen, attached to the wall at the foot of the bed was attached to the wall too low. You have to put a bunch pillows behind your back to view it as you lay in bed. The tv needs to be higher on the wall to make it comfortable for you to lay in bed and view. Also, it should have a swivel hinge for when you are out of bed, not to mention the ridiculous remote/channel finding system on-screen. The room had two sets of double-paned windows, which actually opened about 5\" on each side. The fresh air was nice. Otherwise, the AC works well, though the fan is a bit noisy. I did not use the WiFi so I cannot comment on it. The small lobby has an ATM and computer/internet rental, but I went to the main library to check my email -- for free -- once during the week. Do get an unlimited Metro pass. Mine was $25 for one week. It's extremely convenient and a great deal. I did not take one cab while in town. The metro -- subway and bus lines -- was fabulous!

My hat is off to the creative team who came up with design ideas that just kept me mesmorized as I walked around the hotel. Lobby: Cool and lots of orange. Giant aerial photograph of Manhatten on wall, view into the pool area and neat little check-in, which I was told also doubles as \"your room's mini-bar\". Magazines, drinks and snacks were all available for purchase at the desk. I arrived early, room was not ready yet, but Christian stored my bag for the day. When I returned around 6:00 p.m. I was quickly given my room key. As soon as I got off the elevator I realized I had been given a smoking room, but a call to the desk quickly fixed this. Do hotels no longer ask at check in if guests prefer smoking or non? My room was 1201, which I paid $120 for on Hotwire.com. I immediately dropped my bag and took the next 30 minutes just exploring the various features of the room. It is truly a unique design with some really good ideas, although from a building perspective some ideas just seemed impractical. The shower (there is no tub as other reviewer's have stated) had no light. Even with the light over the vanity and light in the toilet area on it was still quite dark. The shower drain worked slowly and, due to the design of the bathroom, the water flowed into the vanity area and the toilet area. This meant that for the remainder of the evening to use the toilet one had to cross the wet floor of the shower. The wood trim around the base of the toilet room and on the pocket door also seemed to suffer water damage due to the design of the shower area. The toiletries were, again, unique. However, when I tried to use any of the products, the liquid inside just does not flow out. The bottles are impossible to squeeze due to the design and shape of the bottles. I really liked the idea of the dimmer on the bathroom light. This doubled as a night light in the evening. As another reviewer has stated, there is very little water pressure in the shower. The shower head looks great, but again, the design stops short of actually being pratical. The sliding glass door was also a nice touch. Too bad a security device stops the door after it only opens an inch. This renders the balcony outside unusable, which I guess was the idea in the first place. There is a fridge and safe in the room. The air conditioning, although good, is very loud. Not loud in a mechanical way, but loud in a massive wind turbine way. The a/c is powerful, but maybe the fan is just a little too powerful. The complimentary apples in the room were a nice touch, as was the daily and forcasted weather card on the bed. Nice clock radio/ iPod docking station. The platform bed was cool and practical. What a great way to enlarge a typically small NYC hotel room. Loads of luggage storage under the bed, and this is where the room's built in DVD player is also built in. The bed was very soft and comfortable. Many reviewers have complained about the breakfast. Since this is a European hotel, I found the breakfast in keeping with exactly what one would find when traveling in Europe. Great espresso machine, juice, yogurt and fruit to make muslii, bread for toast and bagels. There was also cold cuts and cheese. I thought it was quite a nice touch and free, which in NYC is always welcome. The breakfast crew did a great job stocking things up, cleaning, and generally keeping things moving. Again, the design of the breakfast room is amazing, overlooking the pool and skylights letting in natural light. Some of the seating makes it difficult to eat without making a mess. The pool area is the center piece of this hotel. Located 1/2 way between the first and second floor, it is visible from the lobby (even street), breakfast room, bar, and steam rooms. It doubles as a bar, lounge, sports bar (with a big screen projection on the wall above the pool showing sporting events). The stadium seating area in the pool area is comfortably equipped with cushions and other lounge chairs.

Once I got into the room (before their guaranteed check in time), I was shocked - I thought they must have upgraded my petite room. (I checked at check out and it was indeed a petit room - just on a corner so it was a little larger.) I had a small dessert table with two chairs, as well as a huge bathroom. Yes, it was just one room with a toilet, large counter with sink, and two rainfall shower heads. Lots and lots of hot water and I encountered no problems with water pressure. The room had a thermostat so I could control my room temp (which I took advantage of!). The info book was helpful - local places (with menus) that they recommend (and that deliver to the hotel), hotel info, as well as TV info. The free wifi (get a code from the front desk) was fast and I had no problems with it. The in-room safe and small fridge was awesome and used with no problems. The small closet offered the safe and fridge, a small ironing board and iron, extra linens, a hair dryer, and a small set of plastic drawers for storage). The bed was...beyond words. I could have stayed in it all day. The under-the-bed storage was smart and easily used. The room was quiet (5th floor, room 501) and I was not bothered. Location is ideal if you want to be near the action, but away from the craziness of Times Square. Breakfast was awesome. Not the typical eggs/hashbrowns - instead they offered cereal and milk, bagels, bread, pastries, deli meat and cheese, orange juice, a huge coffee machine (I'm not a coffee drinker, but it looked impressive), fresh fruit (raspberries, blueberries, pears, oranges, bananas), and yogurt. I went later (between 9 and 10) and it wasn't too crowded. Monday night, the DJ was in the pool/bar area. While you could hear it when you walked in, I heard nothing once I was in the elevator. They do check for your room key when you're going upstairs, which I liked. Checking out was a breeze - they asked if I need my bags stored (yes, please!) and either a shuttle/car/cab to the airport. Everyone I encountered was polite, some more helpful than others, but no different than any other hotel. Only drawback that I found - the door/window to my \"balcony\" was drafty.

Had read about the \"bunk beds\" in the Amtrak travel magazine and figured (since the price $300 was reasonable for NYC) it would make for a fun story. The hotel surpassed our expectations! The hotel public spaces have a dark (yet safe) clubby vibe. It's like stepping through the looking glass and into a swanky, yet comfortable club. Case in point, the first 3 floors of the hotel are built around a central, indoor swimming pool and a mix of brightly colored furnishings and steam-room style, millwork wooden ceilings. Our room was clean and functional. It was laid out as a corridor. With a toilet and shower area (two separate spaces - super convenient) down one end of the hall; a sink, glass wine fridge, and counter area in the center; and then the bedroom at the other end. Our room even had a little dining area. Our room had bunk bed, which were less novelty and more functional. The bottom bunk was a queen size bed - very comfortable. The top bunk was a twin - also comfortable. Very secure. The linens were decent quality. This was far from the hostel or college bunk environment that I feared ;) At night on the weekends, the hotel turns sort of night clubby - with 20-somethings frequenting the hotel bar and swimming pool - which has a swim-up bar. It was definitely for the early to mid-20's set. The bar prices were very high, but that's NYC! The free breakfast was your standard continental fare. Our only snag was upon check-in, the registration desk staff could have been friendlier (they seemed inauthentic in an overly scripted, detached manner). The rest of the hotel staff (bartenders, housekeeping, and the morning breakfast staff) could not have been friendlier and more accomodating. Case in point, at one point, a housekeeper was retrieving supplies from a closet and the door partially blocked the hallway that we were trying to pass through. Instead of stepping out of the wall, closing the closet and waiting for us to pass - she literally closed herself in the closet to ensure that she didn't cause us a delay!

I travel to the city every couple months or so to escape the scenic countryside of home (Bucks County, PA) and, as a result, it has become an exciting and (mostly) rewarding pursuit to try a different hotel on each excursion. With so many to pick from, the challenge is to find the best room at the best price in the right location for the weekends activities. I booked my stay at RM Grace when it popped up on my favorite travel site advertising a deluxe room at a reasonable rate for Valentine's weekend. Tucked into a side street just blocks from Times Square, with breakfast included (available until noon) and an indoor pool and steam room, as well as a DJ in the lounge most nights, I thought this could be just what cupid ordered to set the right mood. I was a little unsure if this really was the right choice for a romantic getaway as the reviews I read here (and elsewhere) were sending mixed signals and the description of the hotel let me know this place was different from the norm. Boy was it! The RM Grace is a hot little number that offers up just the right amount of unconventional wisdom and unusual amenities to make it the perfect choice for a sexy weekend rendezvous! For purient interests, I'll skip the particulars of my weekend and share just the highlights, and the few shortcomings, of what I consider to be an exciting \"hidden gem\" hotel. Pros: - I read reviews that complained about room size (not surprising in NYC) but our room (#1402) was spacious and well laid out. I particularly loved the bathroom configuration - a large area w/ extra long vanity countertop and seperate shower and toilet \"rooms\" (I made a prior request for a toilet with a door since I read some rooms omit that feature). - A balcony! I didn't know our room had one until I discovered it during my entry inspection. I pulled open the blackout curtains and there it was, as well as a horseshoe panarama of skyscrapers that we could view from our bed! Very romantic. - Yes, the bed! Fluffy pillows (four of them), a great mattress and even greater linens! - The steam room! In my book - a welcome feature anytime, anywhere. But to cap off the evening after a nightcap or two with a steam and a shower before bed - heavenly! - The hotel location is convenient and comfortable for walking, wandering, shopping, eating and sight-seeing in the heart of Manhatten. P.S. We had dinner at the Irish pub right next door. It was busy but there was no wait and the Irish beef stew was to die for. - The staff at the hotel were beyond efficient. The ones I had contact with were bright and personable and eager to be of assistance. That always makes the stay more relaxing. Cons: - The hotel facade is almost unidentifiable from the street. If not for the suspended orange clock that caught our attention we may have continued on right past the hotel. - The lobby / front desk is also a bit elusive. Upon entering the hotel the floor plan suggests you continue forward down a corridor into an unseen area but, in fact, a quick left once inside the entrance puts you at the front desk kiosk, which also serves as a convenient, if expensive, refreshment and sundries stand. - The pool area is situated just behind the lobby. This fishbowl is sufficient for wading, standing, sipping a cocktail, perhaps floating but not swimming. And actually since it is walled in glass and open to the bar, hallways and elevators it's not really suitable for my swimsuit comfort level anyway. Neat idea though and I imagine with the cool lighting, big screen tv above the pool, dj spinning grooves and alcohol flowing it makes for a great private party venue. - The room was well appointed but for a few curious details. The small table and only one chair (when there is room for two) is peculiar. The in-room tv is mounted on the wall behind the drapes and at an odd angle to the bed. There was no cd player to be found (so much for my chosen mood music ). The shower stall is adequite except that in order to turn on the water you must reach the handle fixtures located directly underneath the showerhead (no matter how quickly you try to move out from under the rain-showerhead while prepping your water temperature you're sure to wet any sleeves you may still have on. But have no fear, the faint water pressure only causes minor sleeve dampness) And last but not least, the uber-comfy platform bed is surrounded by a raised, two foot wide, leather covered ledge. While I found this unusually appealing, it could also become quite cumbersome for an extended (or drunken) stay and, possibly, dangerous under the wrong circumstances (It does prove to be an awkward balancing act, even stone-cold-soberly, to access the balcony. You must climb onto the leather ledge, tip-toe between the draped windows and the edge of the bed and ... well, it's really too strange and difficult to describe how this works and definitley not for the clumsy, obese or lazy to attemp to navigate). - Oh, I mustn't forget the breakfast buffet (a compelling inclusion at any hotel)! Well, actually the only word that comes to mind is... meh. It was typical. Bland breads, hard-boiled eggs and a few rolls of cheese and deli meats. Enough to hold you over until you go for a real meal. Now that I have pointed out a few of the quikier aspects of life at the RM Grace, I must admit it really was very easy to acclimate to the European-esqe enviroment. And although you can find plusher, more opulent accomodations in the city, there are also many mundane, plain-jane rooms for rent that don't leave the kind of impression thRM Grace does. Overall, I found this hotel to be charming and romantic, hip and vibrant, all at once.

Plus, if you want to take a shower there is no place to put a towel other than across the bathroom where the towel bar is. I think the \"designer\" of the hotel was going for some type of minimalist cool design but instead it is completely impractical if you are traveling with a friend, or child. Now, believe it or not, I liked this hotel. The staff was INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful. The breakfast was FANTASTIC - espresso, cappucino, eggs, fresh fruit, croissants, breads, meat and cheeses just to name a few things. And the staff there was nice too. As a matter of fact, the entire staff from Maintenance to Housekeeping was incredibly polite and friendly always saying hello, good morning etc... The lobby pool is wild -- it is like you are swimming in a fish bowl. At night (I was there on a Saturday) the bar area was PACKED with people and also people swimming and drinking. If you are in your 20's this is the place to be. The sauna and gym are nice too. I like to try different hotels and this was an intersting one. If you want something more like a traditional hotel room this is not the place for you. If you want to try something different and really are just going to sleep and that's it this is the place to be.

I didn't remember being given an option when booking for smoking or non-smoking, but we were immediately given an alternative room. - Swimming pool and sauna.

We left Philadelphia by Boltbus at 10:30 am ($10 one way, a comfortable two hour ride from Philadelphia: both the cheapest and the fastest route) and arrived at 12:30 on Saturday afternoon. Check in wasn't till three, but we took a taxi from 34th and 8th to 125 W 45th St (15 minutes; $7 with tip) and were at the hotel. We had intended to drop our luggage and proceed to lower Manhattan, but happily, they had a room open and gave us the key. The room was small and spare, but the memory foam bed was large and made up in luxurious sheets & comforter.Widescreen TV, ipod dock, phone, plenty of closet space. Separate rooms for toilet and bath. The bathroom contained a large walk in shower, a sink, safe and refrigerator, which you can stock at the newstand, which does triple duty as a convenience store and as the front desk. They had explained that the pool (yes, an indoor pool in Midtown Manhattan) was open 24/7, as were the steamroom, sauna and lounge, where you could get complimentary espresso, capuccino and teas all night long. We wandered down to the second floor to check out the pool, and though it's small and shallow (about 4 ft deep) it's a lovely facility. The steamroom and sauna are close beside, and one side of the pool has a window to the bar, so you can get your drinks served in the pool. The lounge is above the bar. we got a cup of reviving (and surprisingly good) free coffee from a machine in the lounge, and went off to face Soho and Tribeca. Before we left, we asked the desk to send robes and slippers up to the room. When we got back to the hotel we were tired and bone sore. Our robes were ready, and we changed and went down to the pool. There was one other couple, a man and his bikini clad companion. The sauna, steam and swim combination brought us back to life, we went back out on the town for some more fun. When we got back from dinner and drinks, the lobby was chock full of people, paying a $10 cover to attend the Saturday night pool party. Dance music pounded from the DJs speakers, and now the pool was filled with young folks having a great time. We went to bed. I should mention that the hotel sits by a row of Irish bars, one of which, The Perfect Pint, has a very hight Trip Advisor rating and a very long list of tap beers. It's also right off Times Square, so you're close to theatres and always have a cab handy. It's also close to all the trains. The next morning we took advantage of the free breakfast: hardcooked eggs, ham and cheese; cereals and yougurt, toast, croissants or bagels, fresh fruit, juice and coffee: this is a continental breakfast you can actually make a meal of. Other comments: staff was uniformly pleasant, wifi access was free, check in and out was simple, and the hotel was quiet: our floor had only 8 rooms, and we were bothered by neither street noise or guest noise, although from the crowd at breakfast early Sunday morning, the hotel was far from empty. And the best part was that the cost per night was $179 ($209 when we include the vast tax lein NY puts on hotel rooms). We booked through Travelzoo, but I ubderstand this is an ongoing promotion through the winter months. Rack rate in most NY hotels is over $300, and the average per rm price in this hotel is $370.

I should point out at that at reception they gave us a map and pointed out where we were. They do have a shop there behind reception but it is pricy (as you would expect, but $4 for a 500ml bottle of water is a bit too much) We got our drinks for the room elsewhere, much cheaper. Stay in this hotel and you are literally 2 mins walk from centre of times square and broadway. 10 minute walk to the Rockefeller Centre and about a 15 - 20 minute walk to the Empire State Building. We walked everywhere (and we were tired!!), Well except to Ground Zero, got half way then jumped in a cab.

A total deal says I. I've stayed in NYC before and I think all rooms there are small, so this one was smallish, but the decor is modern and minimalist and all of the space was used very cleverly, the only thing missing was a closet (!) but I just made due with putting our coats on the platform at the foot of the bed. Speaking of the bed - it was a truly great sleep, and our room (807) was on a corner, looking in one direction across the street and the other down to times square - fabulous! The free breakfast at this hotel is really good, bagels, pastry, cheese, meat, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, tea, juice, and a fancy Italian coffee machine that produces cappuccinos and espressos to order. The dining room was very modern as was the swimming pool area which we went down to one evening to have a soak (it's only 3.5 ft deep) and drinks, which you can order from the pool at the swim-up bar. This plus the poolside DJ was pretty fabulous. At night the pool turns into some crazy bar-disco full of 20-somethings partying in bikinis. Like a whole other world. My beau also loved the sauna. Pretty foxy for a little hotel. The bathroom and shower are a bit atypical, more of a wet room with a half-wall separating the toilet from the shower. There was a pull-across door for the entire bath area, with sink and vanity in the bedroom area, it was a little unconventional but not a problem. Location is great, just a half-block off Times Square and convenient to 1,2,3, V,Q,R,F, B, D, N S, W trains. No problem getting around, save following directions from the staff. There was one woman at the front desk who was helpful (very thin, white, long dark hair) but everyone else at this hotel didn't really seem to care.

We got an excellent rate through Hotwire and were very pleased with our selection. I suppose the atmosphere of the hotel is intended to be chic European. It comes out as an unusual mix of high style and Spartan. The hotel decor emphasizes a trendy look and feel that includes very high end touches combined with tiny, minimally furnished and minimally lit rooms. The Location: Unbeatable. It is literally less than \u00bd block to Times Square. We had a day and a half of snow and ice, but had no trouble walking to Broadway shows and to Fifth Avenue stores. I was concerned that the rooms would be noisy because of the location, but there was no problem at all The Rooms: Small but clean. We had a room that was furnished with a king size bed, over which was a small bunk bed. The king bed was set across the width of the room, and completely filled it. A king size bed is 80 inches long, and there could not have been more than a few inches to spare, so the room was probably 7.5 feet wide. A second person in the bed would have had to climb over it to get to the other side. The bunk bed was smaller than a normal twin. There was no furniture at all, other than the washstand counter. No dresser, no table, no chair, no TV stand; the flat-screen TV is wall-mounted, because that is the only place it could go. The only place to sit was on the side of the bed. On the other hand, the room was clean, although there was a cigarette butt in the toilet. The management apologized profusely about that and offered to re-clean the room, but it really wasn\u2019t necessary, and that was the only lapse. The bed had leather trim and very comfortable pillowtop mattresses on a platform base, which made a nearly perfect match of softness and support. The alarm clock includes an iPod port for your iPod, and each room comes with a DVD player. There is a DVD library available, although we didn\u2019t investigate that. The bathroom is one of the Grace\u2019s real quirks, and could be a deal-killer for some people. The commode and the shower are separate. There is a door on the commode, but the only divider between the shower and the main part of the room is a plastic curtain. You step right out of the shower into full view of the room. This would be no problem for a couple, but since I was with my college-student daughter, we had to make some logistical adjustments. (We learned to put our clothes just outside the curtain, then push the curtain forward just enough to reach them when we were ready to come out.) Oh. Did I mention that the rooms were small? Staff: Invariably friendly and helpful. I read some comments about the front desk being indifferent or worse, but it simply wasn\u2019t so. It is true that they are very busy. There were never more than two people there, and often only one, so that person had a lot on his or her hands. But we got fine service; a little patience was all we needed, and they made a great restaurant recommendation one evening. The rest of the staff, in housekeeping and at breakfast, were also friendly, although there were a number of Asian people working there whose English was limited. Breakfast: The Room Mate Grace seems to understand how much good meal can improve the overall experience at a hotel. This was THE best free breakfast I ever had. It had the usual elements\u2014breads, coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt, fruit\u2014but improved on almost every one. Along with coffee, espresso and cappuccino were available (both regular and decaf). The breads include real bakery croissants and excellent bagels, plus whole grain bread. The orange juice was (or at least tasted) fresh squeezed. There were simple cold cuts (ham and turkey). And the fruit selection included fresh blueberries and fresh raspberries. In January!! The Scene: There is a pool in the lobby. Yes, IN the lobby, next to the bar. On weekend evenings, the pool and bar attract a large crowd of 20-somethings. This means bikinis in the bar and couples making out in the pool. Whether this makes for a plus or a minus for the hotel depends on who you are. But it appeared to be weekend nights only. The hotel has a small (of course!) exercise room, with a couple of stationary bikes and weights. Bottom line: I would gladly stay here again at the discounted rate I got on Hotwire. A quiet, clean, inexpensive hotel right at Times Square is a treasure. But if I were paying full price, there might be other options to consider. Certainly Room Mate Grace is not for everyone. It is certainly not a hotel where you can just hang out in your room, because there is not enough space to do that. You could think of the Room Mate Grace as a college dorm designed by wealthy and hip people. But if you just want a convenient, clean place to sleep and an excellent breakfast when you get up, it will serve you nicely.

This is what I expected when booking the hotel on hotwire. The service was amazing. Everyone was very helpful and polite. The exercise room was small with free weights, 2 bikes and not much else. Everything was working however. The pool and bar area was the best part. When you walk in you pass by the steam room, the sauna and go down several steps to the pool. They have fresh fruit and the pool is 80'+. Great music is playing (on the weekend they even had a DJ) and their is a window where you can swim up and order drinks!

Booked through Hotwire for $249/night, when everything else was well over $300/night, so definitely a savings. Location, right off of Times Square on W 45th Street was great. Lobby is super-small and not impressive at all. We got there at 11 am and our room wasn't ready (check-in isn't until 3 pm), but they graciously held our bags so that we could explore the city. At the front desk they offer, for purchase, all sorts of things you can stock the mini-fridge in your room with - beer, soda, wine, snacks, etc...nice convenience. Our room was ready at 1 pm and sure, it was small, but very well designed for its size. We were in Room 509 and faced W 45th Street, but noise was not an issue at all - double insulated windows - so we thankfully didn't hear a thing as we slept. Bed was very comfortable, linens are of fairly high quality. There is a small plasma TV right in front of the bed which was perfectly adequate. The bathroom is a bit odd, with a sliding door between the shower and toilet area, so you can't have the shower door and the door to the toilet closed at the same time, because there's only one door, but it was clean and functional (and hey, this was only for one night.) Shower pressure was decent and liked the rain-forest shower head. Mini-fridge, iron and ironing board, as well as a hair dryer are all provided. The only thing I didn't like was a cheap set of plastic drawers for your clothes next to the sink/fridge set-up. I think they could do better than that, looks like something for about $10 from Wal-mart. There is no room service, but they do provide menus for ordering in from local restaurants. Breakfast in the am, which is included in the room price, was very decent, continental style, on the 2nd floor. Muffins, toast, crossiants, bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, juice and coffee were offered. Great coffee, by the way. The staff was constantly replenshing, which was great. The indoor pool is something else. Located right in the lobby, and accessible by the 2nd floor, it is small, with a swim-up bar that opens at 5 pm. This is not a pool for small kids. There are a couple of steam rooms and a gym as well within close proximity of the pool. It turns into a club at night with young (think under 30's) splashing in their suits, drinking martinis and grooving to the DJ. Only in NYC! It seemed to be quite the scene. When we got back from our wedding at 1:30 am, it was still going strong. We were tired, but thankfully, we could not hear the downstairs noise at that time.

The bed itself was amazing; it was so comfortable and had great linens. The bathroom was spacious; the vanity opened into the bedroom but the shower and the toilet were self-contained. Everything was very modern in design. Breakfast was included with our room and served in the 2nd floor lounge. Cereals, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, eggs, croissants and muffins were offered daily along with juice, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. A small pool is located off the lobby and has a swim-up bar. The hotel staff are amazing. We always found everyone to be extremely helpful. We arrived in New York at 8:30 a.m. and were immediately given a room. Had a room not been available, they would have happily stored our luggage as they did the day we left but before we caught our flight out. The front desk staff upgraded our room as well!

Both having traveled to NYC previously and stayed in various hotels spanning different price points (The Royalton, Doubletree Lexington and Hotel Solita) we are both very happy with Hotel Grace in virtually every aspect. Hotel location is prime - midtown location, steps from Times Square, Broadway, Park Ave, Madison Ave and subway stops. Rooms - if this is your first stay in NYC you may be shocked to find the rooms small in size but comparing to the other rooms we've stayed in the room size was pretty status quo. Comfortable beds, super clean (I am picky about cleanliness, let's just say obsessive compulsive) bed linens, floors, mirrors, sinks, all of it - SPOTLESS. Decor - modern, minimalist. Perfect for room size. Flat screen tv, IPOD dock/alarm radio; fridge where you can actually store your personal food and bevvies. Closet space sufficient with enough hangers and even a mini drawer for storing socks, belts and accessories. Staff - helpful, knowledgeable of the area. Some of the check-in staff could be a tad more friendly but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and chocking it up to the person having a bad day. The hotel caters, in my opinion, to a young adult crowd. In the evenings the hotel lobby bar and pool area are busy with patrons (aged 21-30), Top 40 music. Having said this there are plenty of restaurants, pubs and venues in the area so guests are not without options. Cab fare to most major boroughs approx $12. Continental breakfast - consists of variety of cereals, breads, fruits, coffee/tea, juices. Quality products. Value - as mentioned previously, having stayed at various hotels at different price points, this hotel is definitely the best value NYC hotel. ** The smell that people have mentioned in other reviews - quite simply, the hotel has a pool, sauna and steam room, clearly there will be a chemical smell associated with these ammenities. Hardly disgusting and definitely does not permeate throughout the hotel. Moot point. Hope this review helps!

For the price, coupled with the location and quality of the hotel this hotel was the best of the three hotels we stayed in while on vacation in NYC. 8. We liked the idea of staying at a hotel with a pool. Late at night the pool turns into a bit of a pick up place by the looks of it.

We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay steps from many NY attractions, with all the comforts of home.

They helped get us taxis when we were in a hurry & reserved a table for us at the Russian Tea Rooms (if you want to go to the Plaza, book in advance - we couldn't get in unfortunately!)

Lovely continental breakfast - croissants, muffins, bagels, yogurts, fruit, cereals, juice, tea & coffee.

They really try. But the Hotel QT's insistence on being hip gets in its way. The good: Great location. Tiny room, but that's why they call it a \"boutique\" hotel. Clean. I hear that breakfast is included, but since it's served starting at 7am, I had to miss it to make an 8am train. The young woman at the front desk was friendly and helpful, although she sent me to a non-existent restaurant. Oh well. It happens. Nevertheless, these are true strong points. But, when the designers had to choose between being functional or hip, they went for hip every time. For example, the shower head in my room was stylish. About a foot across, it hung directly above me. Very pretty. But, a foot-wide shower head disperses whatever water pressure it gets. As a result, you can't really shampoo your hair in it (especially if you have more hair than I do, which let's hope you do). And because it's fixed above you, you can't rinse the downward-facing parts of your body. Ahem. Not to mention that the shower area (an open part of the open bathroom -- very hip, unless you're rooming with someone you don't want to strip in front of) has an outside window as one wall. The window is frosted ... but only halfway up. Why oh why do the QT's designers think we all want to show off our nakedness to the building across the street? Likewise, the bed is on a platform with a lip jutting out. Since the rooms are not all that well lei, and because I am a klutz (all part of not being hip), I kept barking my shins on it. Just another example of a design decision made with hipness rather than functionality in mind. if stark, clean lines matter to you more than being able to take a good shower in a private room, then you will genuinely enjoy this hotel.

All extra friendly, good looking people. We were astonished that we could get a room with a King Size Bed and a single bed loft for under $300.00. We were checked in within 15 mins. On our way upstairs we passed the pool which was immaculate and noticed there was a bar there. Elevator was quick and clean and our room was beautiful! Clean, comfy and modern. After washing up we left and went to Little Italy and shopping and then returned. The Hotel was a party! People swimmng and laughing in the pool, music playing...it was alive! We loved it.

To me, the best thing about QT was the ease at which I could book it online and the friendliness of the emails that I recieved before arrival. The problems started on arrival. The staff I found (with the exception of one) extremely stand-offish (moreso than your average NYer who invariably warms up after thick-skinned persistent efforts to engage in friendly banter!) and entirely unhelpful. The attitude started when I arrived early and they kept (to the second) to a 2pm check-in. Tick: unflexible. The \"lobby\" reminded me of your local YMCA complete with chlorine stench that permeated throughout the bottom floors of the hotel. The concept of a pool is great, the practicalities less so. Tick: stinky and remniscent of embarrassing days pulling at your flowery swimsuit in front of class mates aged 5. Also on the ground floor lobby, the \"check-in desk\" was more like a small newsagent kiosk (which it basically was): concept, you do everything yourself (buy magazines, water, remote control batteries (more of that in a minute) there). Requests to recommend/book a restauraunt or indeed any other general asistance you may ask for were met with a look bordering on (in quick succession): shock, horror and resentment. The lift was an experience in itself. When the lift doors did open the dark corridor was bathed in a hazy red light, a sort of montage of such movie comforters as Psycho and Dressed to Kill (but set in a brothel). Scary stuff. The room was, I will say, great fun. Bunk beds! Freezing lower bed by window (issue with seals I think) and the top bed was like a night in the fiery pits of hell. It was so hot up there (she points fearfully) that the metal ladder getting up was scorching. Also, the remote didn't work (even after I went to the \"kiosk\" to collect batteries. Twice). Room service? What room service: you get a pile of take-out menus and order yourself. This means that you have a warm glow inside, safe in the knowledge that unchecked psychopaths from the local takeaway (or whereever) are traipsing about the corridors looking like extras in said Psycho or Dressed to Kill. So lock your doors. For drinks (including alcoholic): you head to your trusty kiosk and for a mere 10 dollars and a face that looks like a bulldog chewing a wasp, you get a tin of luke warm diet coke. I won't mention how much the fizz cost. Finally, the in-room \"loo\". Oh, the loo. And the shower. Our room had no separate loo: like a UK studio flat (except without the separate room for the loo). The actual loo is situated behind a wall to preserve the visual (but not audio) modesty. The shower is covered only by a curtain (not the area leading to it), so if you didn't live \"in a naked house\" and you are sharing with someone who does not regularly see you naked, you must dart (watching not to slip and crack head on the cute mosiac titles - what a way to go) furtively behind the shower curtain while your cohabitee is bashing the remote control on the table, ordering take out. Always one to accentuate the positive: it meant that we got the most of my favourite city and rarely spent more than 20 minutes a day there! Devasting review, but I hated the place.

Our taxi driver from JFK found our hotel very easily (the ride took about 40 mins ($53 inc. tip and toll)). We entered the hotel and approached the front desk/kiosk and were greeted by a kind lady who swiftly wished us a happy anniversary (my boyfriend and I also celebrating our 3rd year together). As we completed our check-in, I requested to buy a bottle of water and it was given to me for free(I love free stuff!) The receptionist also upgraded our room and stuck to all of the guidelines we provided on our booking (i.e. room on high floor to avoid street noise). When we went out for a few hours, on our return we found that the hotel staff were kind enough to leave in our a room an anniverary card, chocolate, and some alcohol to celebrate. We were pleasantly surprised by the design of our room (it was minimalist and cleverly desined). Becasue the QT does not have its own restaurant, in the room portfolio (provided in each room), we found menus for local restaurants which deliver (from Mexican to Italian to Chinese to Sushi). The tv had about 40 channels (although we were out most of the time), and the room was equipped with a dvd player, minifridge and ice box to stock up using the ice machine in each hallway. The breakfast was divine(!): Fresh bagels, eggs, muffins, yogurt orange juice, and array of teas, coffee etc. etc. Re location: couldnt be more perfect! We were literally steps from Times Square (exact location W 5th and Broadway)! Within 10 mins walk from the hotel is MTV Studios, all Broadway shows, 42nd Street Subway (one stop/4mins from 34th Street where you can find Macy's!), 5th Ave. (remember that Broadway is actually 7th Ave and so all the major shops are just two Avenues down), Port Authority Bus Station (where you can get a bus directly to Woodbury Common Factory Shopping Outlet), and Restaurants such as Junior's for their legendary cheescake! Overall, this was a fantastic hotel. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to any of our friends visiting the city in the future. The only thing that has stopped me from giving this hotel a full 5/5 is the fact that the indoor pool & pool bar (which looked so inviting) was unavailable to hotel guests for most of our visit due to parties being held by external business. This is the only thing that has stopped me from giving Hotel QT a full score of 5/5. Tips: To save money, buy a 7-day metro card which allow you anywhere on the Metro system.

Closet space is a little limited but there is plenty of space on the platform surrounding the bed. We were on the 11th floor at the back of the building and it was extremely quiet.

We asked to be given a room on a higher floor because some of the reviews we'd seen on Tripadvisor had mentioned street noise and/or noise coming from the bar during the night. The reception area as you walk into the hotel is the brightest and coolest I have ever seen. You can stock up your mini bar from here with lots of different snacks and drinks (at a cost of course!). Upon check-in we were upgraded,which was a nice surprise. Our room was on the 13th floor (which we appreciated because we'd asked for a room higher up). The room was very generous and was probably the equivalent of a 'B' room on the hotel website. The decor and room was minimalistic but it had all the basics you need. The king sized bed was very comfy (probably the best we've slept in!) and helped us get a good nights sleep after all the walking and shopping we did during the day. There was a wardrobe, which consisted of a pully curtain, rail (with hangers), a plastic set of drawers, an iron and an ironing board attached to the wall. There was also a flat screen TV, safe, fridge, ipod alarm clock, table with chair and a window seat. The room was cleaned everyday, fresh towels were always left and the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner was always restocked. Breakfast was really nice, a good selection of cereal, bagels, muffins and croissants and a choice of coffee, teas and fresh juice. The cutlery and plates were plastic but we thought this was a quirky touch! The bar was great at night with a nice atmosphere. The drinks were a little expensive but we were on holiday, so didn't really mind. Try the apple martinis! On Valentines Day we were left a little note from the hotel and 2 boxes of love heart sweets, which we thought was a nice touch! All the staff at the hotel were all really nice and helped us out with directions to shops and attractions when we needed it. The location is brilliant for doing the tourist thing. Times Square is just to the right out of the front door and 6th Ave is literally a minute to the left. The nearest subway station is on 42nd at Times Square and is probably the best way to get down to the Statue of Liberty, Battery Park and for hopping off at Greenwich Village. We loved the decor and layout of the hotel, it wasn't on a big scale but had everything you needed in the space it had. If you are used to going to chain hotels, or like standard things such as wooden wardrobes and metal cutlery then this hotel probably isn't for you. But if you do want to try something different and be in the centre of midtown manhattan then this is the place for you!

Who these people are jumping in the pool at 2am, though, I have no idea. The lobby bar is cute and a great place to arrange to meet friends. Just a half-block from Times Square, the location is almost too central, and the area is very touristy, thus it's a bit tough to find a cheap breakfast or whatever. But, that's New York.

The size was great and we stayed for 6 days - the lack of room dressing helps maximise the space. And they were spotlessly clean.

The front desk provided some good tips on trendy bars/restaurants and gave us some complimentary passes to certain clubs. The pool and sauna looked cool although we never found time to use them! The negatives: The front desk seemed to have an issue with taking a holding deposit on a UK chip and pin debit or credit card - between me and my partner we tried several cards unsuccessfully. In the end they kept locking us out of our room each day, which was a little rude when we kept trying to pay them!

The shower in our room could have done with a little more water pressure! The gym is tiny to say the least, but hey there is enough equipment to work up a sweat.

I don't generally believe in conspiracy theories, but this place has got me thinking. Firstly, the good bits. The location is excellent. That's it. Having read all the previous reviews I don't know whether I'm missing something, but I just don't get this. I would liken the experience to staying in a stupifyingly overpriced youth hostel. View any of the promotional material, website, magazine articles, and you will see an idyllic shot of a swimming pool with a cocktail bar, effecively in it. This is the hotel's only good feature, and resultantly the whole place smells of swimming pools, whether you're in the reception, the lift, your room. We did try this pool out as I quite liked the idea of having a cocktail during swimming. Only problem was that there was never anyone serving. Talking of the reception, this is basically a sweet shop with someone serving, and miserably at that. On arrival, we were grunted at by a bloke who I assumed was in charge, but I got the distinct feeling I was interrupting his daydream. We were early, but the prospect of early check-in seemed to him preposterous, and our luggage was therefore stored by his colleague. The room to be fair was ok, but no better than ok. Again, it had a gimic feature, this time an elevated bed, but the room itself was poorly lit, depressingly decorated in grey, and had that \"open prison\" feel about it, which for an opening night tariff of $360 you don't really expect.

So, I stayed at Hotel QT for just over two weeks in June '06 with my boyfriend... There were a few things that didn't go as smoothly as hoped, such as the hotel not having our reservation when we arrived (this problem was quickly sorted by the lovely receptionist who upgraded our room and gave us some nicely chilled beers to take up with us!), and also the fact that there were so many chemicals in the pool (which, I have to admit, seemed to be closed almost every three or four days... only for an hour or two though!) that my boyfriends trunks changed from navy blue to a strange greeny colour! So, if you're going swimming wear old trunks/bikinis, and take off any jewellery too! However, despite these slight hitches we had an amazing stay! The pool/bar area is just too cool for words... there are pool parties every tuesday and thursday... and as for the weekend... all I'll say is simply, don't even think about staying here if you aren't up for a good party! (Oh, and if you are in the bar look out for Jeremy, he's the absolutely gorgeous one with the long-ish dark hair... tell him that his favourite Scottish customers are asking for him!) Lol! I really can't express in words just how cool the pool/bar is... whatever you do, don't forget your swimming gear... and it would be a crime to visit this hotel and not have a cosmo while lazing in the pool! The rooms are great... I've never stayed in a hotel in NY before, but I wouldn't say they are overly small... enough room in the handy storage space under the bed for our two large suitcases, and plenty of rail space for the clothes we wanted to hang up! The shower/toilet set-up may be a bit open plan for people that aren't that \"close\"... but for us it was fine! As people have said before the bed is amazingly comfy... and the actual lay-out of the room is very well planned with regards to space available! As it has been said in almost every review, the hotel's location is excellent... literally a 2 minute walk from Times Square (yet surprisingly quiet at the actual hotel despite this), and right next to a great Irish pub (there seemed to be lots of them close to the hotel!) called O'Lunneys (ask for Keith! and if you're looking for a 1am snack after a good night out drinking have a cheeseburger - they certainly do the trick!).... there is also a Starbucks close to the hotel which was handy for popping out for sandwiches in the morning (the hotels breakfast is great... just that we were never up in time to catch it!)!

I have also stayed in the Standard in LA which is designed by the same guy & my advice would be; if you have stayed in the Standard do not stay at QT as you will be dissapointed!

All we had to go was the reviews on Tripadvisor and the Hotel QT website. We were VERY impressed. 1 - it's VERY cool. All the rooms are different, but very trendy and yes, the beds are the most comfortable hotel bed ever. The shower/bathroom/toilet all in the same room didn't bother us, but it might if you're not intimate with the person you're sharing with. We stayed in 2 rooms over 6 nights as we had to change after the first night - we were on the 8th floor right over the street and the noise from the Garbage trucks drove me mad (my wife says she didnt' hear them but they drilled into my head). The great news was that when I went downstairs to tell reception at 3am, they were really nice about it and moved us to a (larger) room at the back of the building the very next morning. This new room, on the 10th floor, was so quiet we overslept everyday!!! The room was cleaned everyday, regardless of what time we left the hotel, and the staff were always friendly. BTW - we booked the Class B room, so I don't know what the cheaper ones are like. 2 - it's 15 seconds to Times Square. There are also some great bars next door, and a deli 3 doors up. You have to buy your own mini bar supplies which you can do from reception. This is great if you feel like a beer at 3am, but it's very expensive. Go 3 doors up and grab a 6 pack for the same price as 2 beers at reception. 3 - Breakfast is great and you can eat enough to keep you going. Cereal, Bagels, Fruit, Juice, Coffee, Croissants, Yoghurt etc. You can eat it there, or the guy serving was kind enough to give us a tray to take it back to our room. There's heaps of seating too, just don't get there too late or there's no good pastries left! Remember to tip the nice man!! 4 - The pool and bar look great, but with so much to do and see in Manhattan, we never got the chance to use it.

I was hoping to maybe get to use the steam room or sauna before bed but the whole pool area was like a scene out of a Roman bathhouse. Guys making out, girls swinging drinks around. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for having a good time but I was not expecting this type of scene at all when we arrived. It was very noisy but once we got to the room you couldn't hear anything. But when we did make it to the room we were a little dissapointed to say the least. My first impression of the room was that it was 1. quite small 2. there was no platform bed like in the pictures 3. the tv was not centered over the bed and did not move so it was hard to see 4. there was a HUGE stain on the carpet that was a bit gross 5. and the view from our hotel window was of a back alley and air conditioning vent. We called downstairs and the girl was very nice but there were no rooms to switch to that night so we had to wait to switch rooms the next day. The process of changing rooms was easy and they did it while we were out enjoying the sites the next day. Our second room was MUCH better but the noise from the street was a bit loud but it was worth it to have some sort of view. The shower was a great, rainfall fixture. The bed was super comfortable and the sheets were nice, not scratchy. When we came back the third night there was another big party going on or maybe it was just crowded with people from the public because the bar is open to the public. The bar tender wasn't too friendly and the drinks were way over-priced even for New York. My boyfriend had a crown on the rocks for $10!!!! He had had one earlier at Tavern on the Green for the same price and it was double the size! The whole scene was a bit over the top with people either all decked out in crazy trendy clothes or virtually naked running around the indoor pool area. I was a bit dissapointed that we couldn't enjoy these ammenities without all the chaos but if you like that sort of scene then this place is for you. It is very trendy and a bit overpriced for what it is but hey it is New York afterall. I wouldn't stay here again but I would recommend it to my single friends who are looking for a little nightlife (and over-priced cocktails) to go with their hotel stay.On a scale of one to ten I'd give it a five maybe a six at the most.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saintfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant unique hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Gemsm", "ReviewID": "UR5358224", "Content": "Was in New York for the first time, took my boyfriend as a surprise for his 30th birthday, as he always wanted to go to NYC.

None of the staff wear any type of identification which can be a problem if somone knocks on your door saying they are with the hotel. The hallways are very dark and as a woman, I was not comfortable walking alone at night to my room. The elevators take forever so we often chose to use the stairs - at least we got our exercise. The front desk staff can be quite rude if questioned in any way, however, the manager was very professional when addressing our problems.

What a cool place. Having stayed in many boutique hotels I found most of them to be a disappointment. However, the QT was better than I expected. I had read a couple of negative reviews before I left so wasn't sure what I was going to get. I requested a room high up in the hotel and that's what I got. We were on the 12th floor in room 1205. Nicely layed out room. Bigger than I thought. Huge shower head which made you want to stay in there for hours. Big comfy bed, flatscreen TV, cool magazines and a nice little cushioned seating area by the window. Ok it could have done with a few little extra's such as somewhere to hang your towels, a proper wardrobe door rather than a curtain and some drawers but they aren't essentials. You can get by easily enough without them. The only thing I found slightly odd was the shower and the toilet being in the same little area. They were quite far apart but if you are in the shower and your partner needs the loo it could be a bit tricky. We did however have a sliding divider to close off the shower / toilet room but it might have been better to have the toilet separate. But then to be honest we actually never needed the shower and toilet at the same time so it was fine. Our shower / toilet area also had 2 massive windows which were frosted halfway up. My boyfriend was concerned that people from the neigbouring office blocks would see you showering etc. but I am pretty sure they would have to be at a very strange angle in their office to see you. Plus once the shower is going the glass would steam up anyway and when you were sat down on the loo there's no way anyone could see. And in the whole time I was there I never actually saw any people moving around in the offices anyway. So if I couldn't see them ! Personally I found it really cool to have a shower and be looking out the window with the sun shining through and the sounds of the streets of Manhattan outside. Some friends of ours were in the room opposite us 1206 and their room wasn't as well designed as ours / seemed slightly smaller (even though it was also an E sized room). So I think maybe some people strike more lucky with their room than others. They also seemed to have much more of a ledge around the bed than us as our bed ran width wise along the window and theirs was lengthwise with the headboard backing against the window. So it made it quite difficult to navigate getting out of bed. Lots of young media / fashion types stay here so the bar / pool / sauna area are all very cool in their design. The staff were all wonderful and helped you with anything you needed - restaurant recommendations / directions etc. None of the snobbery or attitude I've experienced with more expensive hotels. In fact on the day we arrived they were having some cake in the bar area for employee of the month and offered us all a slice which was a nice touch. Breakfast could be better given there's so much fantastic food in New York but it's fine for what you pay. And if you don't like breakfast at the hotel then there's always a couple of nice deli's just to the left of the hotel - Cranberries and Dunhills. You couldn't fault the hotel for location either. Literally a minutes walk from Times Square in one direction and a couple of minutes walk in the other direction to lots of the big stores on 5th Avenue. At the end of the day if you are worried about the size of your room when you are in a city like New York then all I can say is get a life! Ah - one final thing I would point out is that when checking out they take the money and then give you the itemised bill. So make sure you ask for a print out before you pay or at least make sure you double check because the room rate we had been quoted / booked wasn't what they charged us. They charged us 50 dollars per night more. Thankfully my boyfriend remembered I had mentioned it was 230 dollars per night not 280 and I had a print out of the reservation confirmation with me. You should remember to do this too. I spoke to them they refunded the difference immediately including the percentage of tax. Thing is when checking in they asked me to sign a slip agreeing the rate of 280. At the time I said it was wrong so I had it amended.

The small ledge that runs around the bed (So the person on the window side can walk off the bed without having to step on or over the other person) was truly annoying as it is quite possible to slip on it while getting out of bed in the dark. The fact there were no drawers to put clothes in and only 6 hangers in the closet were a problem as well.

Hotel QT is a designer budget boutique hotel just off Times Square. If youre wondering what the hell that means then basically a trendy, independent (as oppose to chain) hotel into which a great deal of thought about design and suitability for market (20 to 30 somethings) has gone. The budget part is not that theyve particularly cut corners with the final product, more that they have condensed a simple, no frills design into a more compact, profitable space. First the good bits. Location is SUPERB, about 100m from the centre of Times Square. So as well as the local excitement, most places youll go on Manhattan will be no more than about $15 in a cab, probably much less. (For all its glitz, and with only a few exceptions, Times Square area is actually devoid of any notable restaurants, bars or clubs). We waited no longer than about 30secs for a taxi at any time of the day, although the drive through the Square can be frustrating, so walk to the corner of 6th & 45th if youre in a hurry. Some rooms are quoted as having views of Times Square, but I doubt you can really see more than a small sliver. Reached from the 2nd floor, but visible through glass viewing panels in the lobby, is a DJ booth overlooking a small swimming pool, steam room & sauna (all free to guests & bar users), and the place comes to life at the weekend with pool parties & music going on into the night. Room although small, has been well designed with plasma screen TVs and CD/DVD players. Bed was the comfiest weve ever slept in, and an empty fridge meant you could stock up with your own drinks (dont buy from hotel reception $$$, see below). Bathroom was clean and spacious (compared to the tiny bedroom area), in a wet room style, with the shower being a modern chrome dinner plate design (could have been more powerful though). As for the few gripes we had, the room was tiny. Many reviewers complain unnecessarily about small hotel rooms in New York, but this place was like a veal crate. At a guess, I would say the bed took up 75% of the room, leaving barely enough room to squeeze past each other. Only a small wardrobe for clothes (no drawers), meant the suitcases were tucked under the bed full for our stay. The reception doubles as a small news kiosk, selling magazines through to alcoholic drinks, although we only used it once. The bill for 3 drinks came to $35. Our room was at the front, and if we hadnt been so tired from jetlag / walking / drinking etc the noise would have kept us awake most of the night. Ask for a high room as the road works and binmen started at about 6am, I suppose the only time the streets around Times Sq are relatively empty. Overall, youve got to be MTV generation or young at heart to enjoy a stay at Hotel QT. If youre sharing a room, make sure you know the other person well cos youll be on top of each other, although for a room and hotel of this quality in the centre of New York its probably a sacrifice worth making. Book early though as the place is justifiably popular. Price is excellent for location, quality and features. We paid about $190 a night which included a breakfast we never ate.

On arriving, I found I had a 4th floor room (this is a TALL hotel), and immediately asked if it could be changed; I was told to return the next morning and ask again, but when I did, I was told, eye-rollingly, that I should have asked the previous evening, but drop by again later, which I did, only to be told I should have asked someone different, but let me check... etc, etc. I was eventually moved to a fabulously peaceful 16th floor room on my final night, and was offered a bottle of wine to make up for the bags under my eyes, but beware: street side rooms are VERY noisy, especially if you're staying on the weekend! When I checked out, I was also charged at a different room rate to the one I'd booked over the internet; it worked out slightly in my favour, but did give me a moment's panic. That said, the QT's charm made up for any shortcomings - the funky rooms have free wifi, the beds are super-comfy, the complimentary breakfast is particularly good, and there is a (smaller than it looks on the website!) poolside bar. It's very good value, and the midtown location makes it convenient for getting around.

I wouldn't recommend stocking up at the kiosk - $6 for a small beer, $6 for a bottle of water - but go a couple of doors down to the Deli and stock your fridge up there. Price (our double was $200 a night) was fantastic for the location. You're yards from Times Square and a brisk 15 minute walk to Central Park.

We got kicked out of the steam room and sauna by a particularly curt maintenance guy - the only rudeness we encountered on our whole trip - he could have taken charm lessons from the guy in the lobby who helped us stash our cases when we checked out and organised a company car to take us to the airport (only a few dollars more than a cab, and more comfortable).

My boyfriend and I have stayed everywhere from Super 8s to the Bellagio, and you simply cannot beat this hotel's mix of style, design, comfort, friendliness, intimacy, and value. We loved our stay and found the hotel perfect for our needs. We are artists/professionals in our early 30s -- probably the demographic that Andre Balazs has targeted. We value good design, attention to detail, comfort, style, impeccable cleanliness, friendly service, and good value, so this hotel was perfect for us. Frankly, the QT is a brilliant concept. We checked in at around 6pm by a friendly agent. She invited us to the movie night at the pool the next night -- they were showing JAWS. At first we were a little taken aback at how small the room was, but once we organized ourselves, the room became very cozy. Remember to bring an alarm clock; we forgot ours. For $160 per night, we got the smallest room, the \"F,\" (one housekeeper told us that all rooms that end in \"12\", i.e., 612, are the tiniest). It was a great rate for a tiny room that burst with amenities. The room was a queen on a platform pushed up against a large window (that opened), flatscreen TV, DVD player, immaculate fridge, small closet, room to hang clothes/coats, and wetroom bathroom (with towel racks) with a sliding door that ensured privacy (I know some rooms open right into the bathroom -- not ours). Towels were fluffy, huge, and Egyptian cotton. The room was perfect for a couple. The room also included a hairdryer, iron and board, and -- a plus -- a safe that fit my 15\" laptop (it will fit a 17\"). We used the DVD player as well. You also get FREE wireless internet for your entire stay (most hotels charge up to $10-20 a day!). I loved the convenience of looking up maps, restaurants, theater, etc. on my laptop. There's a full range of cable channels. We were able to take home our leftovers and store water and sodas in the fridge. Granted, we had to climb over each other to get out of bed, and there was little room for anything but our bed, but we used the underbed storage well and just got used to the cozy space. For the price we paid, it was a great room. And about that wonderful bed...I have to agree with other posters -- the bed is DELICIOUS. Down comforters and pillows, Egyptian cotton sheets, pillowtop mattress. Overall, the room and bed were extremely clean. Certainly no bedbug infestation in our room. I looked forward to the breakfast every morning. It is substantial and full of choices -- delicious flaky croissants, real NY bagels, pastries and muffins, hard boiled eggs, almond and coconut studded granola and yogurts, cereals, a make-your-own-latte machine (the staff helped me make one), fresh fruits, juice. It was served in their clean, nicely designed mezzanine space. It was the best complimentary breakfast I've ever seen (some hotels give you a gummy danish and coffee and call it free breakfast). The pool/bar scene was relatively dead through the week and then erupted into a huge pool party worthy of a hip hop video on Friday night. We didn't indulge, but thought it would be a fun option if you're into that sort of thing. We didn't hear it at all from our room on the 6th flr. Also, a friend who works at the channel told us that this is the hotel where MTV puts up their visiting bands because it's inexpensive yet hip -- so if this matters to you, this is the hip spot to be, at least in midtown. Lastly, I have to commend the staff on their great service. On returning from dinner our first night, we casually notified the front desk that the DVD player didn't work. The repair person came so quickly that he must have followed us directly from the front desk! He then immediately replaced the DVD player. (Though the DVD player location was ridiculous -- I would suggest a shelf above the flatscreen because its location UNDER the platform is laughable). Breakfast staff was friendly and helpful, and front desk agents were smiley and friendly. I hate snotty, painfully hip customer service, so thankfully, there is none of this at QT. Lastly, location was excellent. We went everywhere -- almost every subway line seemed less than 2 blocks away. We had a fantastic vacation -- so much fun -- and the QT was a huge part of it. We can't stop raving about it and are bragging to all of our friends about this great hotel. We did not have to sacrifice style and comfort for a room under $200 a night.

The DVD player is underneath the bench seating. The closet has nice thick steel hangars, no drawers in the room but plenty of space to store stuff under the bed. The layout of the bathroom for the king w/bunk is spacious enough to move around easily. The bathroom has a long counter, more spacious than a many expensive hotels with an additional outlet.

There are no mini-bars, but there is a fridge and the front desk sells everything you need to stock your own mini-bar that includes items such as Champagne, hard liquor, beer, and snacky food items as well. The best feature of this hotel is the bar and pool area. It fills up with uninhibited 20 somethings that end up in the pool. This was amazing to see, it quite literally started out as a flock of poeple that started out at the bar and then after a few drinks they bought bathing suits from the Front Desk area and were off to the pool. It was a real party and not at all rowdy as it may sound. Also apparently there were local celebrities there, actors from the local broadway shows. Keegan at the bar (one of the hotels greatest assests, by the way) told me that the bar itself every once in a while confirms that people have their birthday parties here, and what was going on in and around the bar/pool area.

As others have mentioned, the mid-town location is just half a block from Times Square, and is ideal for most tourist activities. It is very convenient to Broadway, Rockefeller Center & Radio City, Fifth Ave, and St. Patrick's, and is a short cab or subway ride to downtown and uptown locations. The property itself does try to present itself as trendy in a minimalist sort of way. The bar is located beyond the lobby and half a floor below the adjacent swimming pool, which is seperated by large windows. While visually this makes for an interesting space, a strong chlorine odor was quite noticeable in both the lobby and the bar. The rooms are small as is typical for value oriented hotels in the city, but are very efficiently designed. We stayed in a corner room on the 8th floor with twin platform beds positioned perpendicular to each other along outer walls of the room, with a small flat screen TV that swiveled to kinda allow both occupants to view it. The only other furnishings were a small pedestal table, and a dorm style refrigerator. At the opposite end of the room was a large tiled shower with a great \"rain shower\" fixture, but modest travelers should be aware it is completely open to the room with no curtain or door. The toilet is in a separate enclosed space next to the shower with a closable door. There was also a good sized vanity/mirror and closet bar for hanging clothes that could be concealed behind a sliding curtain. The condition of the room was above average and clean. We found the beds to be very comfortable, but most surprising were how quiet the room was given the proximity to the hustle and bustle of Times Square. We seldom heard disruptive street noise, and never heard anything from adjacent rooms. Another big plus is free wireless Internet access from all the rooms. The design proved to be very comfortable despite the small footprint, although as others have noted expect to live out of your suitcase since the only storage space is for hanging clothes.

For a budget hotel (it was just under $200 a night), without many of the bells and whistles of other more luxurious hotels, this was an excellent choice for our stay in NYC and really enhanced our time in the city. Here, in point form, are some of the things you should know: 1. We asked for a room on a high floor, and got it without any problems. Ask for it early, and you will get it. 2. We stayed in Room 1301, which despite the unlucky number 13, was a great choice. We had a corner room, which apparently is not as large as other rooms, but found the room perfectly adequate for our needs - a large king bed, a lot of space behind a large curtain for our luggage, bar fridge and ironing board, a separate bathroom and plasma TV. 3. The room felt new to us. No sign of wear and tear. The bathroom was separated by a door (in the traditional sense), with a vanity, toilet and shower (which was in turn separated by a shower curtain. We did have towel racks. 4. The reception staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. Apart from a few forgotten requests, we were happy. 5. The breakfast is FANTASTIC. So convenient, well set out, and very tasty - bagels, muffins, croissants, cream cheese, jams, butter, hard-boiled eggs, juice, coffee, milk and cereal, with a toaster. Take advantage of this - it will save you time and money. And get there early before the breakfast room (on level 2) fills up with other guests. 6. Location, location, location. Literally around the corner from Times Square, but on West 45th Street which is not too noisy. Broadway shows are just a few steps away. Going the other way towards Sixth Avenue, a left turn and up two short blocks and you were on the F-Train subway, one of the most convenient subway lines, with easy access to other lines downtown and uptown. 7. We needed to stay an extra day and found the reception staff very accommodating. 8. It was the most comfortable sleep I have EVER had in all of my travels. That bed was amazing - extremely comfortable - and the room was so quiet! Stay here. Ask for a high room.

Our reservation was made 8 months prior - in March 2005. 3 days before arrival, we called the hotel to confirm our reservation and room type: king bed with bunk for 2 adults and one teenager. All was well, or so we were told. Upon arrival (after a long day traveling from the west coast) we were told we had a room with 2 twin beds. When we expressed our surprise and dismay, we were told we had \"only made the reservation for 2 people.\" That statement in and of inself annoyed us no end, and we were then told there was nothing they could do, they had no other room for us. End of discussion (take it or leave it) as far as the clerk was concerned. Miraculously, after presenting a copy of our emailed room reservation confirmation, a different clerk helped us, and while we were crammed into a king room with cot for the first night (which they really should have given us a partial refund for), we were moved to a larger room (1207) king bed with twin bunk the following day. Luckily, the attitude we encountered that first evening did not extend to the rest of our stay. We found the staff to be satifactory, and the hotel manager (Tiffany) was more than helpful when my husband had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital one morning. Breakfast was provided, which made mornings easy to manage. The room was adequate, though already showing signs of wear, including an ample amount of mold on the tile grout in the shower (UGH). We loved the layout, though there easily could have been some drawers added to the room without compromising the design. No, there is not one single drawer in the room. It was a pain to pull our suitcases out from under the bed whenever we wanted any of our folded clothing. Bathroom has a long counter (probably 7' or more long) which could have been a great feature. Unfortunately there is only one little light right over the sink, so that renders about 5' of the counter space completely and utterly useless. I am very grateful we had a room on an upper floor. I cannot imagine staying on the 3rd or 4th floors with the loud music from the lounge area. Even though we always went to bed later than 1, the bar was still loud most evenings after that. Location was terrific for us, as we has show tickets all but one night of our stay. So easy to walk back to the hotel late at night. Subway is just a couple of short blocks away. As is shopping on 5th Ave. Easy to walk to Central Park and other sights. All in all a good stay.

This was not a big deal to us - but I did say more than once that my 80-something parents would have hated this room. As others have noted, there was nowhere to hang a towel. If this will bug you then go to the dollar store and buy a suction cup hook to stick in your suitcase. There is also no clock or radio. The staff was very friendly and courteous, the bed was divine, and the whole atmosphere was so pleasant and positive. Another plus is that we figured we saved at least $30 on breakfast every day we were there, as we each had 2 espressos, bagels, an egg, the most incredible granola and a huge glass of FRESH juice every morning. The pool was 93 fabulous degrees, the sauna was wonderful....I am still on a high from that trip, can you tell?? Of course, U2 at Madison Square Garden and Spamalot might have contributed to that!", "Date": "October 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again!\u201d", "Author": "CFF", "ReviewID": "UR4020822", "Content": "My husband and I are in our 50's and stayed at Hotel QT for 2 nights.

I had read all the reviews before going out and all seemed to be quite positive, but you are always wary until you get there incase it turns out completely different. Hotel QT surpassed all my expectations and I will definitely be going back there when we go back to New York. Location wise for starters cant be beaten. 50 mtrs from the heart of Time Square, right next door to two excellent irish bars, and close by to metro stations, bus stop,etc. The Hotel itself is quite inconspicous from the outside, and probably just looks like a magazine shop to someone looking inside the front window, however you only get too appreciate how cool it is once you actually go inside. The check in desk was also where they sell magazines, drinks etc, however on arrival at about 1:30pm, we were given rooms straight away and found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful, something that we experienced all throughout our stay. From the front door staff to the porters, even the maids cleaning the rooms, everyone always took time to say hello or good morning. On arriving in our room, we were given one in the front of the hotel on the corner of the building(1210). All the rooms appear to be different sizes and ours was on the small size, however, perfectly adequate for the 6 day stay (including getting dressed on our wedding day). My parents room was (1008) and this was a lot bigger in size, however there wasnt as much natural light in their room and the toilet/shower faced right onto the room. We had a separate bathroom with a window. The only thing suggestion I would make is that they frost up the whole window as the top half isnt frosted and I had to wait til the windows steamed up before I had a shower, just incase someone had binoculars in one of the taller buildings opposite!! In addition to a smart flatscreen TV on the wall, the room also had a DVD player which we used to play CD's through the TV. All rooms have fridge, which although arent that big, they are enough to hold a couple of bottles or 6 or 7 cans of juice/lager,etc which you can buy at the front desk. There is also a cupboard with hangars, and so there was plenty of room to store clothes, despite there being no drawers. There is also a small safe in the room, which is free of charge and a phone. The beds deserve a separate mention, as they are without doubt THE most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. So much so that I even took a note of the make of mattress, as I want to buy one for myself. The pillows and quilt are a mix of down and feathers and you practically melt into the bed every night. They probably arent the easiest beds to get into if you arent too mobile, as they have a padded shelf round the side, but this isnt even a gripe, just something worth noting. I cant remember having a better nights sleep in my life. The hotel also has a steam room, sauna, small fitness room (two bikes, a rowing machine - both with TV's on the front and some free weights- barbells). The steam room was particularly good, and really helped relax you after a hard days shopping/walking. The pool is down a few steps, and on weekends a DJ plays in the pool area and there are comfy pillows on the steps looking onto the pool. The pool is very small, not for swimming, although you could get a few strokes of breast stroke in. Its also pretty cold. There is a window at one side of the pool so you can get drinks put on your tab, although as some people have commented, the prices are a bit more that the nearby irish bars, but hey, if you are only getting one or two!! The hotel also serves a continental breakfast every morning which is brilliant and you can eat as much as you like. If the breakfast rooms too crowded then you can just take it back up to your room. The staff we encountered, as mentioned before, were very helpful. On our wedding day they organised private hire limos, and couldnt have been more helpful. They do use google searches if you need to find somewhere, but they try there best to help you as much as possible. All in all we had a fantastic time and will definitely use this hotel again and again. My only concern is that it will get more popular and the prices will go up and it will be more difficult to get a room. However with this being New York, thats very unlikely. We'll definitely be back.", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Young", "Title": "\u201cHotel QT\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3987503", "Content": "First let me preface this by saying that i am extremely, extremely neat!

This hotel only takes credit cards checking in, cash is not good enough. I had a fraud problem with my credit card the day before I left and my bank put a block on my credit card. I took cash for the room thinking it would be good enough, after all who wouldn't rather have cash? When I checked in they informed me that they didn't accept cash checking in, however I could pay cash checking out. So what's the difference?? I probably wouldn't have had a problem if I would have been informed of this when I called for my reservation. I sat in the lobby for 2 hours, they wouldn't even let me check into my room at 3:00 in the afternoon and then work it out. It was my daughters birthday and she was suppose to be on TRL on MTV, but because of the delay, she missed it. They let me use a third party credit card after a huge hassle and faxing authorization forms back and forth, but didn't get checked in until after 5pm. They also approve the credit card for alot more than just the price of the room. They add an authorization of $50 per night for extras. So for 3 nights they had to authorize $900. I offered to give them $1000 cash checking in and they wouldn't accept it. After the hassel of getting checked in, we got up to our room. I had asked for a room with a view, but got a room with a view of a brick wall and a very small window. The window did open which I liked. I asked about moving to the type of room I requested (which they showed in their computer) but they said they were over booked and unable to accomodate me. The room itself is just as descibed in other reviews and yes, the beds are great. The staff was nice, but just not accomodating. The wireless internet access was so slow I was unable to do anything on the internet and the code changes daily so you have to keep calling every day to get the new codes. Location is also great as described in other reviews. Starbucks across the street and an Irish Pub right next door. Times Square is a block away. Overall, wasn't bad, but won't stay there again.

I booked through the Avant Guide website and paid $135. Staff says that all the rooms are different, so its hard to tell if mine was representative - but the king bed was on a platform that seemed a little high (18 inches) with the mattress on top - so you couldn't walk around the bed... you kind of had to climb up and crawl over to the far side if you we 2 in the room... not a real problem for most... but if you have access concerns, something to consider - I tried walking on top of the 'wrap-around' platform but banged my head on a beam, so I went back to 'the crawl'... seems like a trimput of design over function... don't know if the designer has actually ever slept in one of the rooms.... Other than that, its minimal but comfortable - great mattress, linens, pillows and the flat-panel TV... so if you're out enjoying NYC and just use your room to sleep - its great.... There is a 'dog bone' shaped light fixture over the bed that you have to squeeze your hand up inside to turn on or off - but the main purpose of this seems to be as a passive sound reflector which is pretty cool... No space for a computer except on the platform edge... There were several people being moved to larger rooms.... it looks like some of the rooms in the corners may be smaller.... one was a business type that needed to work, another a honeymoon couple - but the staff was very nice and accommodated them with no problems.... But plan in advance, once the hotel is finished it may be hard to upgrade if you find the room small. My room was in the center 803 and long with the entrance in the closet/bathroom area which was very well designed except for the lights which were too bright if you turned them on while someone was sleeping... Towels and 'Kiss my Face' amenities were nice - and the shower/toilet sliding door is unique. They need to add a hook by the shower to hang your towel while you're in the shower... now, you have to put it on the floor outside the shower... or walk across the bathroom to retrieve it from the shelf while you're dripping... Again - high design by a designer who ovbiously never slept/showered in their own rooms... The staff said that they were getting lots of complaint about this - so they were thinking about adding a hook somewhere... Staff is all very helpful but still learning...

The reviews of this hotel and the website had me intrigued and for the most part my overall impression is on the favorable side, with the exception of customer service - one place you shouldn't skimp even when offering \"budget\" accomodations. It began upon my arrival: The front desk was woefully understaffed, and my check in took 40 minutes, as reception also serves as a kind of newstand and snack shop for guests. Guests can purchase items there to fill the minibar, and with only one person there to help everybody I was in for a wait even though I was the only guest checking in at the time. The second major inconvenience came when they put a hold on my credit card for double 3 nights, plus $50 per day in incedentals. I wasn't aware of this until the next day and a phone call to the manager fixed the problem yet another day later, but the attitude I encountered when asking for $1200 to be take off my card until I checked out was frosty. I've never encountered anything like this in the past and I travel frequently. One other funky thing you may encounter is with the rooms themselves, which has been mentioned before, but you don't really believe it until you see it. I was travelling alone, so it wasn't an issue, but my room had two twin beds and an open shower which faced the rest of the room directly. If you're travelling with someone you don't know intimately, *ahem, it could be very akward. However, the hotel is decorated interestingly, in a great location, the bedding is VERY comfortable (really one of the best things about my stay was the comfy bed) and the complementary continental breakfast is quite nice.
