No one else had access but hotel personnel. The hotel took absolutely no responsibility for the theft. We declared the theft to the police,and later that night got an alarming phone call trying to get one of us to leave the room and go to the reception to deal with \"a problem with our credit card\". The reception had not called- the call was external- and it was clearly someone who had card key access to the room and wanted to get us out. All of us ended up feeling extremely unsafe and I heaved a sight of relief upon leaving.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cTypical budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "IanAberdeen", "ReviewID": "UR23243944", "Content": "Comfortable rooms - a double bed in every single room; two in a double.

It was relatively convenient for us as a place to stay while visiting our daughter, who attends and lives near UNAM. Being on Insurgentes, it's easily accessible by the MetroBus and there are lots of restaurants nearby. The decor is pretty sterile with no connection to Mexico. The room was generally clean but the housekeeping was inconsistent. One day the maid simply skipped us and we were amazed to find the room untouched when we returned in the early evening. They did make up the room when we asked. The biggest issue at this hotel was the front desk, which never had more than 1 person working, which simply isn't enough. That one person had to handle all check outs, check ins, phone calls, inquiries, etc. The people working the desk tried but simply couldn't do an adequate job and the management of the hotel should provide more staffing. Breakfast was adequate, but again staffing was an issue as the kitchen staff couldn't keep up with the need to keep the continental buffet stocked with food and, more important (to us), coffee. It was ridiculous to be given instant coffee in Mexico City, in my opinion.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cityexpress Insurgentes Sur", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d758174-Reviews-Cityexpress_Insurgentes_Sur-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$93 - $95*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av.
