However, there isn't any taxi ramp here, so it'll take a bit more effort to flag down a cab. 2) Decent room - we were assigned a room on the 1st floor (the one above ground), in a neighbouring building. The room is clean (we did find one roach - but I'll bet you've found roach in your own place before too), and it had most of the amenities we feel to be necessary. 3) Having stayed at the Novotel recently (much more expensive), this hotel actually provides more toiletteries compared to Novotel (there's comb & dental kit provided). 4) Check in and Check out were hassle free, and we didn't find any problems at all with the front desk service. 5) Clean, functioning bath. Cons: 1) Some of the electrical appliances don't quite work as advertised - the hair dryer, for example, refused to work beyond a few minutes at a time,. 2) We did find a roach (a small one) in the room - no major dramas there, but perhaps a sign that housekeeping can be improved. 3) The breakfast isn't a very varied spread - there's rice, soup, bread, some sausage, eggs (not an egg station, just egg cooked in whatever way they fanct for the day), some vegetable, and fruit. You do get coffee or tea and a juice as well. 4) You just get 2 bath towels - there isn't even any hand towel. 5) If you're looking for privacy, look elsewhere. I can hear every word spoken in the corridor outside my room, and there isn't any peephole at the rooms to see who's outside as well!

Why they could not just confirm with the company I do not understand, but we had to go throught he process of forwarding on our confirmation to the hotel for their records. Whilst a small point, this is really not what you want when you have booked in advance and arrived from the airport. The hotel rooms are small, but very clean - very much reminded me of a business hotel, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The rooftop pool is TINY, with two/three deckchairs and no space for anyone else. The breakfast included was a little odd - buffet style with the usual selection of baked beans and fried noodles. What I found strange was the sign that stated you would be charged $0.50 per gram of food wasted. I didn't see anyone actually weighing the wasted food, and whilst I think the right intentions are there, the sign left a bad taste in my mouth. The hotel is 10 mins from the Bugis metro station which is a great location, providing quick access to a lot of the Singapore sights.

The hotel was approximately 1.5 kms from Little India so we decided to walk whenever we went to Little India. The best part that I realised after reaching is that this hotel is around 1 kms away from bugis junction, which is another shopping point for many Indians. The hotel was a small one with small restaurant attached. The package included breakfast, which was decent and had good spread. I believe, in Singapore the real estate price is expensive, so as it was a budget hotel, the room size was quite small, may be 12 feet by 10 feet, which had cupboard, king size bed, LCD TV, a table, two chairs and two side tables beside the bed. Although, the room was small but the it was fully clean, the bed had a great quality mattress, the batroom was fansactic and centralised AC. The staffs were quite helpful and offered promot service when needed. At the reception, there is a small lobby with a sofa where you can wait for your vehicle to come for local site seeing. I found something which is both good and bad is the punctuality. The rooms will be offered to you exaclty at 2 PM and for check out, you need to definitely leave before 12 Noon.

While I was there, hotel guests seemed to be about 90-95% Asian tourists/travellers on business. Breakfast is fine - but if you need Western fare, your choice is limited.

The breakfast was not fantastic and totally unlike 4-5 star hotels but it was tasty enough for me to take double servings. The staff were not very attentive and did not seem very concerned about giving you the best service with a smile. However, checking in and out have been relatively breezy and quick. There was once when they could not find the PayPal documents for a room I booked. That delayed my check-in. But it was no big deal. The receptionist took my credit card for deposit and returned it when the necessary documents were printed and found.

I stayed at this hotel twice in a short time as stopovers as part of a big overseas trip and both times I checked out I was made to wait while the front desk staff radioed to a housekeeping staff member to check my room to make sure nothing was stolen or damaged.

Along the way, you will pass Raffles Hospital which has a food court at ground floor. Walking further 10 minutes from Bugis Station will reach Sim Lim Square. Coming back from Orchid or Chinatown on bus will stop at the bus stop right in front of the hotel, across the road. All staff we have encountered are friendly and helpful. The lobby is small and always packed with hotel guests, however not a problem at all. The cafe in the hotel offer reasonable food and breakfast. They always keep the cafe clean and neat.
