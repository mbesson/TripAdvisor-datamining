After emailing the hotel manager about my concerns I was assured that the hotel was clean. I found my room to be very clean and cozy, even the bathroom. The bed was comfortable. There was a little noise outside the room from other guests. The price was great, but did not include a free breakfast. Luckily the hotel's locale is perfect and there are tons of restaurants on the same street(I went to Fresh twice). There are also tons of stores and coffee shops on Bloor Street. Bloor street felt safe and I walked after dark. The parking was around $20 for the underground parking garage, and the car was fine. The staff was sooo friendly from check in to check out and in between. One staff member gave directions gallore during a very goofy conversation, and others were just smiley and nice. I forgot my sunglasses in my room, after check out, but a hotel employee gladly called up to housekeeping and had them retrieve the glasses for me in record time. The location was excellent and I can't stress that enough. This is a good spot for a two day vacation, and you could certainly stay right in the bloor street area and have a great time and plenty to do especially if you enjoy restaurants and shopping.

On a main road, just opposite the Bata Shoe Museum, the hotel was very comfortable and the staff could not have been more helpful. One of our cases was damaged during the flight, and an enquiry at Reception saw a roll of Gaffa Tape appear by magic to enable me to make a temporary repair. Reception even sorted out a reservation on the Hop-on, Hop-off Sightseeing Bus service for us, arranging for the bus to stop outside the hotel to pick us up. Top Marks for that. Eating is a minor hiccup at the hotel as the only place to eat was the adjacent Fox and Fiddle pub, ideally located for an evening pint and meal, but not ideal for breakfast with a lingering odour of last night's antics and carpet cleaning activities going on whilst we were eating. As UK silver surfers on limited funds we also found prices everywhere fairly daunting. Probably reasonable for the locals (my son's wife as a window dresser in an upmarket store chain earns twice as much as he does in England, and he is a High School Teacher!), but at first we were worried about stretching our budget to survive. Bargains such as Happy Hour pitchers of delicious Canadian Lager for just over \u00c2\u00a38 helped ease the pain and after the first day we just stopped worrying and put everything on the credit card to sort out later. After all, we shall only be passing this way once and life is too short to worry! I did enjoy the steak and eggs breakfast one morning and all the food we ate there was excellent and served in generous portions. One thing which constantly upset our budgetting was the habit of adding sales tax and a service charge of 15 percent on every bill without any indication on the menu, adding about 25 percent to the prices shown. The hotel room was excellent. Two large, comfortable double beds, adjustable air conditioning, power shower and a 26 inch flat screen TV made the place feel like home from home. The first time I turned on the TV I got Coronation Street from about 12 months ago followed by promotional breaks pushing X Factor every half hour or so - welcome to Canada! May I recomend the sightseeing bus service to everyone - one ticket lasts for a week and includes a boat trip around the islands in the bay on the Lake with a spectacuar view of the Toronto skyline on the return. There is a commentary on the sights as the tour progresses and you can hop on or off at 24 points en route, with buses running every 40 minutes. Well worth the cost for a week long \"taxi\" service. On the day we checked out we were pleasantly surprised to get an envelope pushed under the door which listed the items we had charged to the room so we could check them at leisure prior to settling up when we left. All in all, a very happy stay at a reasonable quality hotel which I would recomend to anyone.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood central location for exploring..........\u201d", "Author": "TonyJudge", "ReviewID": "UR120658840", "Content": "We stayed here for only 1 night and used primarily as a base for Niagara Falls but also to explore Toronto.

As a woman in my 60's travelling on my own I felt perfectly safe in the area at night - I even took the subway back to the hotel after attending an evening play in the entertainment district. This location is quieter than the more central location, and in my view, more interesting with its easy access to the Bata and Royal Ontario museums, the University and Chinatown. There are lots of restaurants within easy walking distance and, for the budget conscious, there is a Tim Horten's just a block away for a quick bite, and a Metro grocery store a block in the other direction if you want to buy your own meal fixings. There is no pool in the hotel, but guests have access to the facilities at the community centre up the street. Local calls are free for Priority Club members. The only real drawback is that the hotel is not on the hotel bus route from the airport, necessitating either a pricey cab ride ($55+) or a lenghty ride on public transit if you're travelling from the airport.

To be fair to the cleaners it was tucked in at the back of the phone. Towels and bedding were newer. The pillows were labeled as soft or firm. The carpet looked like it needed to be replaced. I was nervous about sitting in the office chair so I put a towel over it. Nothing was super dirty but it wasn't clean either.

It was great that we didn't opt to park their during our stay because the lot closes after 12 am (something that the rather curt front desk woman completely left out). Ok. lets get to the point of this review. Our hotel stay was pretty dismal. The showers made a noise whenever you attempted to use the hot water. It reminds me of the noise that pipes make after they have been frozen. The bathtub wouldnt drain properly and left you in about 5 inches of standing water after taking the obscenely noisy shower. We decided to ask the attendant if we could change rooms (after they sent the hotel maintenance to \"fix\" the shower issue which they couldnt). In our new room on the same floor the shower issue was still there although not as bad, and we found a new plumbing issue- the bathroom sink also leaked! This seems to be a hotel that is often frequented by large groups of younger people on trips, etc. So, if you are traveling with a family steer clear at all costs. We were awakened at 230 am one night by drunken shouting and the slamming of doors by a large party of hooligans who invaded our entire floor during the second day of our stay. Also, none of the hotel rooms come equipped with refrigerators. It will cost you an additional $10/day to rent them, which is absurd.

Yes, it is limited in terms of service and currently undergoing renovations but this is all mentionned upon making reservations (at the time of writing this review, renovations should have been completed). We stayed at the Quality (just changed it's name to Holiday Inn Midtown) and for the price we paid in downtown Toronto, it was perfectly fine. You just can't expect a glamorous 5-star hotel when paying 150$CAN per night in T. O. Still, that being said, I found our accomodation of good quality, especially for a Quality Hotel. Carpets and flooring are brand-new through the hotel, most furniture in the room was too, but small things such as bedside tables and curtains haven't been changed yet (reception staff told us that the furniture was arriving progressively week by week to avoid closing down a whole floor in the summer season, which makes sense). A/C was central and very cold, something I haven't seen often in Quality Hotels and it's great! Room and bathroom were clean and modern. They are no fitness facilities, pool or saunas on-site but you do have access to one If you ask. We did use the free wireless high-speed internet in the room (8th floor) and the connection worked like a charm (and fast). The Fox and Fiddle restaurant on-site didn't really impress me nor my friends. Orange juice was made out of powder and expensive (2.75$!) and wait staff was uninterested. The small caf\u00c3\u00a9 by the lobby is the opposite, friendly and affordable with great offerings. There is a 24-hour grocery store directly in front of the hotel, very convenient. The location is not bad, it's in a quieter area of downtown Toronto, near fashionable Yorkville and Avenue Road (a 2-3 min. walk) but you are not close to the Eaton centre. It all depends on what you're planning to do. Subway is a 2 min walk and will get you there quickly. Our room faced Bloor St. and we slept well, but the back rooms are surely more quiet. Cons: Maid service only provided us with 1 face cloth and 2 towels the first day, none the 2nd day and we had to call for extras both nights. It took ages for them to send some. Plan on waiting a good 30-45 minutes If it happens to you. That's how long it took us both times. Half of the front desk clerks were unhelpful and bordering on the rude side. The other ones were fine but with limited knowledge. If you are used to some nice advice by the concierge at The Hilton or Marriott, then, you will be deceived. In the end, If you've booked, don't cancel, it's a perfectly FINE hotel and I personally don't believe it's a dump at all.

Apparently, they have never heard of the term, \"Service Elevator\", so you wait and wait, and wait some more for the workers to get where they're going. The management should have done the responsable thing: either give everybody a price reduction or hang a sign on the front door, \"Closed for renovations.\" It must be noted that the hotel did inform us ahead of time that there were renovations taking place. They assured us over the phone that we would be given a room high enough so as not to be bothered; sadly, that was not the case. Sure, renovations end; however, they do so a lot quicker than attitudes. And it's the latter that are the real problem with the Quality Midtown. We looked at other hotels in the same area. There's a bed and breakfast on Madison St. (a few blocks away) that looked charming (unfortunately, it was booked). That would be my first choice if I returned.

All booked through Expedia. I'm 23 by the way. I try to go somewhere on my own once a year, so this time I visited Toronto from 15th March - 21st March 2005, and what a wonderful time I had. Everyone is so friendly and laid-back, it's such a beautifal and clean city, albeit it will look better in the summertime. Very easy to get around using the top-notch TTC (Public Transport) system. I recommend picking up the lonely planet guide about \u00c2\u00a39 from amazon. It's excellent with city and subway maps. I stayed in at the Quality Hotel Midtown, with a free upgrade to a business room. Nice large ensuite room, TV, Broadband Internet,Cofee maker etc. Also excellent bar/restaurant downstairs in the hotel, with pool table and arcades. Bar was teaming on ST Patrick's day. Places to go - CN Tower, excellent view, Niagra Falls- Magnificient (better in the summer years), Skydome, Harbourfront, Bata Shoe Museum, Royal Ontario Museum, Chinatown + plus much more. Also the pound is at a great rate so for all you shoppers I recommend the Eaton Centre, Yorkdale Mall, P.A.T.H (Underground Walkway +Shops). Also visited a friend who lives in Etobicoke, nice place down there. I highly recommend Toronto, its still cold in March (similar to English weather) but not freezing. Unfortunately don't have any photos to hand. I know some people have reservations about travelling solo, but there is so much freedom in it, and its very difficult to not make friends. I met quite a few people on the plane, in the airport, in my hotel, also on my tour to Niagra. Still keep in contact with them. Hope this review helps.

The carpet in some of the main areas is getting shabby and should be replaced as it could be a hazard. We had to change rooms after seeing the one given to us at check-in because of stains on the sofa. The hairdryer in the bathroom only worked on one setting.
