We stayed for a weekend getaway with friends and felt like we had gone to a luxury hotel. The staff was very attentive and always had a smile. Although we didn't bring our dog, many people did and it is a very pet friendly hotel. With that said, there was no evidence of dogs other than seeing them in the lobby and at the bar. The rooms are well insulated as we never heard a dog or anything other than city sounds when our window was open. There is a nice rooftop bar with firepits and a view of Petco Park. There is a reflection pool (that some dogs would enjoy) and a grassy area just for your pet's needs. The room was spacious and if we needed anything the staff was there to fulfill our needs. The coffee maker in the room was nice but it would be better if there was more than one regular coffee pod and more condiments to accompany the coffee. There was however a choice of teas and decaf coffee. I am sure if we called the front desk they would have sent some up but we were eager to try the restaurant in the lobby. The food was attractively presented and very tasty. It was a wonderful stay and we would definitely stay there again. I must add that we felt very welcome which is not always the case with nicer hotels. Chris at the rooftop bar was very gracious and mixes a great drink and Matt at Table 509 was on top of his game with quick and friendly service. Even the valet staff was helpful with entertainment suggestions in town.

We chose to stay there because we were making a quick weekend getaway to San Diego and wanted a hotel that would accommodate our two senior Golden Retrievers. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the valet staff and the front desk. The hotel has been modernized and is nicely decorated with sea themed colors and a water feature in the lobby. We noticed patrons with dogs in the lobby and at the bar. We were told that the rule about dogs is that there are no rules and referred to the 9th floor observation deck and bar where dogs can join their owners in an evening cocktail, use the grassy potty area well supplied with doggy poop bags, or romp in a little fountain/dog reflecting pool. I am a dog lover, and make sure that I am a responsible dog owner. But I was not sure what to expect. To my delight the facilities are well maintained, modern, and very clean. The observation deck/bar had comfortable seating, heaters and a couple of fire pits. Dogs and their owners enjoyed the space harmoniously and those who had not brought their dogs enjoyed socializing with the visiting canines. I would have given the Hotel Indigo 5 stars, but there were a couple of draw backs. Though the room looked great with durable dark wood laminate floors, modern furniture with simple lines, and a well-appointed, spacious bathroom, the bed was a big disappointment. The mattress was on the hard side which is tough on me because I have a bad neck, but the worst were the small hard lumpy pillows which guaranteed that I woke up many times during the night in pain. The other smaller disappointment was the tv channel selection. There are no rental movies available. If I had been traveling alone, I would have whipped out my computer and watched movies on Netflix, but my husband and I were tired and wanted to watch a movie on the tv rather than have to huddle around a computer screen. If this hotel invested some money on decent pillows and upgraded their mattresses, it would be a straight up 5. As it is, I will most definitely visit again, this time packing my own pillows.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sebastopol, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service, worth every dime\u201d", "Author": "TrueBlueGin", "ReviewID": "UR126550077", "Content": "We stayed with a group of friends March 10, 2012 for one night before departing on a cruise. From the time we arrived to the time we departed and even when we returned to stow our bags for the day before our return flight home, the service, hospitality and gracious welcome were outstanding. Sergio, the concierge/Service-Person-Extraordinaire arranged to have two cars take our group to dinner, and the next day when most of our group went to board the ship, my husband and I had to do some last minute shopping. Sergio arranged for a car to take us to the nearest mall, give us his number so when we were ready to go he would return to the hotel, grab our bags, come back to the mall, pick us up and take us directly to the cruise ship terminal. Amazing! We looked at many reviews on TA before booking this hotel, but in the end we chose it because several of the couples we were travelling with had already booked it. We are so glad we did! It was truly a lesson in getting what you paid for. Oh, and by the way, the bed was very comfortable, the view we had of the stadium was unreal, the temperature, sounds in the hotel (or the lack thereof), and toiletries were all above par. We briefly enjoyed the rooftop bar/lounge with great fireplace table and apparently a little strip of grass. I think it is even dog-friendly! (Check to be sure. I saw dogs, but not sure of the policy.)The location was ideal, within walking distance of several great looking restaurants; I could go on and on.

The bathroom was large, as was the walk-in shower...no tub, but not a problem for me. The ammenities were nice, and the room was clean. The overall layout was also nice, and different with a curved wall, from other hotel rooms. I didn't realize this was part of the ICH chain (ie. Holiday Inn, Crowne plaza). The bed quality seemed to be OK. For whatever reason, I just didn't sleep very well, with the room being too hot or too cold depending on when the HVAC system kicked in. The front desk staff was very friendly, and showed a lot of energy. They seem to know other guests by name, so I think they pay attention to those people staying longer. The WiFi worked nicely. The login was easy, and you could connect both laptops and Blackberries at the same time....other hotels may only allow you to log in using one piece of electronics per room. The distance to the convention centre was about a 10 minute walk. It's also a 10 minute walk to Horton Plaza, and just five three streets away from the gas lamp district. So overall, I would say this is very convenient if you are attending a conference.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "planet earth", "Title": "\u201cA great stay\u201d", "Author": "BlanchePlanetEarth", "ReviewID": "UR124281581", "Content": "We loved San Diego and Hotel Indigo.

It's not luxurious, but it has some panache and doesn't disappoint relative to pictures on the website. The rooms have wood floors, a nice touch. Ours had a curved wall at the closet, breaking up the usual rectangular hotel room monotony. Colors and wall patterns are warm and agreeable. The same goes for the hallways, which gives a welcoming and comforting feel to arriving at one's room. Views can be good. The bathroom is spacious, functional and attractive. Beds are OK, nothing special, which, unfortunately, is the norm in lots of, but not all, hotels. There's no refrigerator or microwave. I think it's $10 a night for the frig; I don't know about a microwave. That's too much for such a simple convenience and was probably the thing I felt least positive about during our stay. To be able to store a few snacks that require refrigeration isn't much to ask. At least internet usage is free. You have a choice of either wifi or ethernet. The lobby is welcoming and bright, casual with character. A couple of iPads and iMacs (running Windows, oddly) are available for use. There's an adequate 24 hour exercise room and a pleasant 9th floor terrace overlooking Petco Park. There's not a pool, which was fine on pleasant, but not hot December days. But I could see where some would find this to be a shortcoming. The staff is helpful, pleasant and professional. I'm fine with saving energy and expenses by not providing new towels, toiletries and such every day, but I'd say that room cleaning could have been a bit more thorough. A couple times, we'd been to the beach and tracked a bit of sand into the room, nothing at all extreme, but it was there. It would have been nice had it been swept or vacuumed more carefully. Not to overstate it, though. The room was sufficiently clean. The Gaslamp District is touristy to the point where we didn't bother with it, but even for those taking advantage, I'd think being just outside it, as this hotel is, is a big plus for avoiding excess street noise. It's not exactly quiet, but for an urban location, it's not bad. I like the East Village location, surrounded by condos. It feels a little like living there because of that. The nearby and underrated ballpark gives great ambience as it dominates the neighborhood with a sort of mythic presence and easy views into the stadium. It's minutes away from Balboa Park by car and a walk to the harbor. Some nice SD neighborhoods (South Park, North Park, Hillcrest) surround Balboa Park and having them so close is great for restaurants, cafes and walking around. Other in town beach areas aren't that far, either. The light rail is just a couple blocks away. Valet parking is expensive (though the valets are great), but there are some good alternatives. On some nights, street parking is easy. A couple of nearby lots are $5 for 10 hours on weekdays/nights, $10 on weekends. There are other lots, too. Careful, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201d on the street, the police will ticket you if you give them the chance. All in all, we had a very nice stay here. It's a fine, if not extraordinary hotel and I'd stay there again if I were looking to be in the downtown San Diego area.

They put me in room 202 which was a handicap-accessible room on the second floor (202), possibly because I prepaid using a discount rewards program. It was fine for what I paid (about $100 a night), but if I had booked directly with the hotel I would have requested a room change. The room was very large and in wonderful condition. Three minor points: there was a pipe that made a clicking noise in the heating vent in the bathroom which was annoying, but by closing the bathroom door I was not disturbed by it. The hot water turned lukewarm on 3 of the 5 mornings I used the shower at around 8 a.m. Third, room 202 is above then kitchen so I could smell breakfast cooking in the morning and steak and burgers at night. If this is a turn-off, make sure you are not assigned room 202. The bed was extremely comfortable. Free wifi. Window in the room opens for fresh air which is also nice. Large closet for all my stuff. I ate in the hotel dining room one morning for breakfast and it was ok. The scrambled eggs with spinach were good but the potatoes were cold. With coffee and tip it was nearly $20. The rest of my stay I ate around the corner at Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys which I recommend for the best bagels in San Diego. They make a variety of sandwiches and with coffee it was usually around $8. Service was very fast and friendly. There are a couple of other bars and restaurants within 1-2 blocks of the hotel; a Thai place, a bar/restaurant/bowling alley, Basic pizza (very good!), Smash Burger, a 7-eleven one block toward the baseball stadium, and a CVS on Market ST and 6th? There is a Starbucks two blocks away too if you require one. The neighborhood is called East Village and it is about 3 blocks from the Gaslamp District. I liked being far away from the madness of Gaslamp but close enough to walk there anytime, even evening. The closest trolly stop is on Market and Park, another 3 block walk. The further east you walk (toward the trolley stop) the sketchier the neighborhood becomes, but I had no problems. I probably would not walk off Market street alone a late at night in that area by the trolley. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego; and many are in this area too. However I was never bothered by anyone; no one even asked for a handout. There is always police presence at the Market and Park trolley stop. I did not have a car and used public transportation to get to the zoo, La Jolla, Old Town, Harbor Island for a whale watch trip. You can buy an all-day pass (includes trolley and local bus service) for $5. A great buy as the taxis are a bit high. I did take one early in the morning to go from the hotel to the Sheraton on Harbor Island Drive (3 miles) and it was $16 and a 10 minute ride. Took the bus back for $2.25. Seaport Village is within walking distance, 10 blocks directly east toward the harbor. You can literally see the Petco Stadium from the hotel. It's 2 blocks away. I pre-booked with SuperShuttle online and had airport to hotel (and return) shuttle service for $16 round trip. A great bargain and painless. Shuttle was waiting for me at the airport after I got my luggage.

Upon arriving, we were upgraded to a nicer room for joining the rewards program. The front desk staff was very accommodating. The room was very nice with modern furnishings, comfortable beds, spacious bathroom, and a nice westward view. The flat screen HDTV was also a nice bonus. We only had a few problems, which were very minor but added up to annoyances. For example, one night one of us had a craving for a chocolate chip cookie and we were elated to see in the hotel info card in our room that room service was available 24hr AND they had CC cookies!! Imagine our disappointment when we called and were curtly told that room service was not available until 6AM :( Another very picky point, was the complimentary coffee, which was awesome that we had our very own Keurig coffeemaker in the room, but there was only one caffeinated coffee packet (in addition to 2 teas and a decaff coffee packet). The staff was happy to bring up a couple extra caf. coffee packets when we called though, however the next day we had the same situation. Yes, I know, this is EXTREMELY minor, it's free coffee! Lastly, we looked forward to enjoying a drink at the hotel terrace bar before we left for the airport, but it was closed (as it was one night earlier) even though it was an hour after the advertised opening time. So instead we grabbed a drink at the first floor hotel bar which was nice (decent happy hour) but not the same as enjoying the San Diego skyline while sitting around a roof-top fire. Also the location is great, just blocks from 5th street, which is filled with great bars and restaurants. Also close to public transit stops if that's your thing.

By 3pm (check-in time), the same rep still didn't grab us and continued to check in other people. (We were very close to the front desk, by their computer area). So we went to check in again, and of course the room was ready. No big deal - everyone has an off day and it gets busy! We sprung for their suite, which was very spacious. The rooms are indeed very nice, and I had very high expectations for this hotel considering it's high rating on several websites. Unfortunately, they have charged us a $300 \"smoking\" fee, claiming there was evidence of smoking in the room. We booked this hotel SPECIFICALLY because it was an entirely non-smoking hotel and I have allergies. I left a voicemail with management and am wondering what sort of \"evidence\" they could have found.

It was more artistically laid out and finished than most hotels and it really made it feel like home not a stock hotel. The bathroom was beautiful and the shower was big enough to film a porno. The terrace on the top of the hotel was beautiful and had a nice bar, again with a wonderfully helpful barmaid. We ate at the restuarant for dinner just because we liked the hotel so much and it was empty, quiet and beautiful. Overall, I'd give the food four stars. My wife's squash ravioli (with braised short ribs and chevril cream sauce) was 5-stars, though. My swordfish was great, too. It was all a little pricey though. The terrace overlooks Petco park and you can actually see a lot of the diamond. The only downer was the heater had some noisy vibration, but I assume they fixed that. I can't imagine that was normal.

After taking the items from him, and thanking him, and telling him to not worry about the card, he came back a couple of minutes later, interrupted us again, and dropped off the card. On the morning of our check out (Saturday, 11/5), the hotel experienced a power outage around 8 AM. In talking to the staff, the outage was specific to the hotel, not the block or neighborhood in which the hotel is located. The hotel's back up generator supplied power to the common areas, but not to the guest rooms. Due to the power being out, we couldn't brew coffee in our room, so we went downstairs to the cafe in the lobby to get a couple of cups of coffee,and was charged for them. It seems like poor service to charge your guests for something that they are unable to do, due to no fault of their own.

When we asked about this, we discovered daily to them means Mon-Fri not on the weekends. They don't have towel racks in the room! For a green hotel, that does not want to wash your towels everyday, it is hard to have dry towels, if you can not hang them up. They do have hooks, but only 2, one for a hand towel, and one for a bath towel. And there were 2 of us in the room. They only gave us one package of coffee, it seems as if they are set up just for single people staying in the room. We had to request more coffee. Parking is $35, which is quite steep. Normally we would have just parked on the street, but with the wild party going on, we decided it was best to do valet. All in all, I don't think that we would stay here again.

Here are our notes by category: Location: we loved the location. It was right on the edge of the Gas Lamp District, so out of the fray and hectic environment of the District, but close enough to access all of the things to do there. Amenities: the gym is awesome. Perfect amount of equipment and when we went (mid-October), there was always equipment available to use. They have Life Fitness equipment, which is a great brand. There are two TVs and it can get a little loud with the acoustics in the room, but overall, we were very pleased with the gym. We had coffee/tea in the room, which we enjoyed. Free wireless was a plus, but we didn't use it very often b/c we were out all of the time. The iHome clock radio was nice as we did plug in our iPod. Overall, the amenities were just right. Restaurant/bar: not impressed with the food quality or service. It's not that it was bad, but we expected a little better after reading that the hotel supports local fare. With all of the other dining options, we forewent the convenience of the hotel for any meal and ventured out on the town. There is an outside bar on the 9th floor, but we didn't spend any time there outside of doing a brief walk through. Room cleanliness: the room was very clean. Having hardwoods, especially in a hotel that allows pets, was a plus from the cleanliness factor, but we heard our neighbor early every morning as she walked around her room in her high heels. There were a few items missing when we checked in (no bath/shower mat, missing coffee/tea and mug), but they brought them the next morning when they cleaned the room. The housekeeping staff was pleasant. Overall, the rooms were clean (which I would expect no less) and we would give them a middle of the road on comfort b/c of the noise from the hardwoods and it feeling a little more industrial than we're used to. Staff: this is where we felt the hotel fell short. The bellman was nice and asked us lots of questions (where we went that day, how our stay was, etc.). But, the front desk staff was not as personable. It was not that they said/did anything wrong, but they just weren't as friendly as we had read about in reviews. We had handful of requests during our stay at the hotel and they were slower to respond and did not follow up. If I had not read the reviews about the staff being so wonderful before we came, our expectations would have been lower and it would have been normal, run of the mill hotel staff. But, we had higher expectations, which we felt were not met. Again, it's not that they did anything wrong, they just weren't what we expected after reading the reviews. Overall, we would recommend the hotel with some reservations. If you are looking for more upscale, plush rooms (like the US Grant), this is not your place. It seems best fit for younger (30's and 40's), more mover/shaker adults.

The bed was fine and one had to move two rather large square pillows and a cylindrical pillow aside to enter slumber. But the four pillows used for sleeping offered no support. While many other hotels give you a variety of pillow (foam, polyester, down, etc.), these pillows felt cheap and lacking support. This could be an area of improvement. Aside from the pillows, another area of improvement is the heating/AC. Although there was a thermostat, it always seemed a bit on the cool side. I noticed one evening it was not set to automatic and the fan was on. Be sure to check yours. Internet is free! Yes, this is a shocker and welcomed. The WiFi was complimentary for the stay and decently fast unlike free internet found in other hotels.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange, CA", "Title": "\u201cIts All Good\u201d", "Author": "jcborange", "ReviewID": "UR119279834", "Content": "A great place to stay near the gaslamp downtown.

We had a fabulous time. Here's why: VALET: There is no parking garage at Hotel Indigo but there is a valet. It costs $35/night. Yikes! I know that seems high but it's open 24 hours and the attendants are extremely professional and very fast. I honestly dont think I waited more than 3-5 minutes for the car each time. Also, they were extremely helpful with directions when asked. HOTEL & FRONT DESK: The hotel is really beautiful. When you walk in, you certainly have a regal boutique feel. The decorations are tasteful and up to date. The front desk was very friendly, quick yet attentive and helpful. David checked us in and he was very sweet. The lobby has two computers downstairs w/ free internet and free printing. This was helpful when I needed to print my plane ticket. They also have free internet in the room GYM: Decent sized gym. Exactly what we expected. Enough equipment for a quick workout and very clean. If you want a real gym there is one right around the corner called FIT. RESTAURANT: Kind of expensive but that's to be expected at a hotel restaurant. Strong drinks. Good food. THE ROOM: As you can see from the pictures I attached, the room was really gorgeous. We stayed in room 814 and I suggest requesting a CORNER room. The view of the stadium was really nice and the sunlight in the morning so wonderful. This is a dog friendly hotel but you would never know it. The floors are wooden which I LOVE so there is no dirty carpet smell. The bed comfortable and the linens extremely clean. Lots of channels to surf on the flat screen tv. The bathroom was big BUT the only only drawback was the shower. While it's a nice big walk in shower, the shower head looked kind of cheap and did not give off much water pressure which left you standing in one place trying to get wet and not freeze. They really need to put in a nicer rain forest shower head to fill up the space and make it more luxurious feeling. In terms of maid service, some of the other reviews Ive read says they didnt replenish or clean every day. This is a GREEN hotel people. You have to hang the \"Please Service My Room\" tag on the door knob when you leave for the day for them to come clean. LOCATION: The location is on the outskirts of the Gaslamp Quarter but honestly it's SO close in walking distance to all the bars at night etc. If you're gay, rent a car and it's a short distance to the Hillcrest area. No biggie. The area is very clean and a 5 minute walk from the stadium.

In fact I really like the location/neighborhood. It would be the must stay place if in town for a Padres game with a very cool gastropub (Knotty Barrel) across the street. The room was nice and clean - I really liked the wood floors. The whole reason we stayed here was because it was a LEED hotel and wanted to check that out. The one thing that people should be aware of is that it is a pet friendly hotel....that did not bother me - but it may some people if they have allergies or not into animals. There was some barking on our floor but it was not disruptive - but something to consider, again, if you are not an animal lover. We had a drink at the roof bar - great views - but limited selection. The staff was friendly and helpful from check in to the valet drivers. When we stayed there I was thinking that I was all set to give 4+stars, but then we had a negative situation with the management/housekeeping. Upon arriving at the airport my husband realized he left 2 shirts behind laying on the bed as he was packing. Yes, it is his fault that he forgot them - but he immediately called the hotel and they said he needed to email the manager of the lost and found as he was not working at that moment. He emailed him requesting that the shirts be mailed and that he would cover the cost for the shipping and any inconvenience this caused. When we did not hear back - so we called the hotel again and they said he was the person we needed to speak with and he was off. 2 days later we received a succint email saying the items were not found and to call the housekeeping manager if we had further concerns. We called her immediately and she said she did not have the items in her lost and found, but would check again and return my call. She did not return the call so I called again the next day and left a message and still we have never heard back from her. This was disappointing on many levels. Yes I realize that it was our responsibility to remember the items - however - we callled immediately and were sent through a lengthy process of days where obviously someone saw the items and claimed (stole) them. I find this very disturbing that the housekeepers or other employee would find it \"okay\" to take something left behind in a room. I understand if something goes unclaimed for weeks or months the hotel has to have a way to deal with the items, but we called the day we checked out, sent emails and followed up to no avail. It is not that the items were expensive or unique - it is more the principal of the matter and how poorly Hotel Indigo handled the situation. I think they may want to set a policy for their housekeepers/employees that taking something that is left behind by a paying guest is theft and not acceptable.

Reasons for lowering the rating: 1. The Hotel has started a Friday Night DJ, not enjoyable if you are trying to get to sleep and it runs till a little after midnight. When the front desk was phoned, they said that they had moved people from another room already, but there was nothing available which would be quiet. Also, since the room was paid for in advance the Hotel would not refund any portion of the money paid for the room. 2. Breakfast menu is not near as nice a it used to be previously.

If I didn't know it, I would never guess it was owned by Holiday Inn. It has a downtown boutique feel and attention to design that is very unusual in a chain. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The valet always asked us if we needed directions, and the gentleman who checked us out did the same, along with giving us a breakfast recommendation. The front desk called about 5 minutes after we arrived in the room to ask if everything was okay. The room rate was very reasonable for what we got: a huge room decorated in a lovely orange and blue color scheme, Keurig coffee maker, sleek, modern and VERY clean bathroom with lots of granite and beautiful tile in the huge walk-in shower with frameless glass door. Lots of little extras like a full size hair dryer, bottled water, an ipod docking station alarm clock (make sure to dim it before you fall asleep-- it's bright!)... and did I mention the view? We're Priority Club members, so they gave us a free upgrade to a king-sized room on the 8th floor with a view of Petco Park. Amazing. The elevators are fast and secure (you have to insert your room key to use them, which I liked), and the hotel is environmentally friendly. Apparently, it was the first hotel downtown that was ever LEED certified. The last night we were there, they slipped a letter under our door offering us to stay there the next night for only $99.00. Unfortunately, I had already booked another non-refundable room somewhere else, so this came a little too late, but we would have gone for it if we hadn't already made other arrangements. The only negatives I can think of: valet parking was pricey at $35 per night, but I'm guessing that's comparable to other hotels in the area. The bar on the 9th floor was a very nice atmosphere (incredible view) but I found the cocktail selection limited and very pricey (over $11 per drink). Again, though, perhaps that's comparable to other hotels in the area. The water in the shower didn't get very hot at 5:00 PM-- really only about lukewarm. I'm guessing that's because their hot water heaters are set on a timer to only heat at peak shower times. I appreciate the conservation aspects of that but dang, I really wanted that hot, pre-dinner shower since we'd been out walking around all afternoon. If you want to stay somewhere that feels a little more special than the run-of-the-mill hotel, but you don't want to pay Ritz prices, Hotel Indigo strikes a really happy medium.

I called and spoke to the manager on duty. He told me that California law prohibits hotels from checking in people under 21. Then he suggested that she check into another hotel. That raised a red flag. I did some research and discovered that the minimum age is 18. The manager simply lied to me and made our situation very difficult. Later, I spoke to the manager about my concern. He said they did nothing wrong and that I should have read the fine print on the website, which states the hotel's policy that people must be 21 to check in. Maybe so. Maybe he shouldn't have promised to admit a guest without asking the age. He certainly shouldn't have lied to me. On a positive note, he offered to bring a bed into the lobby so that our guest could stay the night in the hotel, just not in a room, should we have been unable to make it that night.

My husband and I stayed here for four days while in San Diego. The lobby is fresh and colorful, yet tranquil with a unique water feature streaming down from the ceiling. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The building is LEED-certified. The location was convenient for walking throughout the Gaslamp Quarter, to the waterfront, to a walking/running path, to nearby bus stops, or for short cab rides to Coronado or the zoo. Our room was bright, welcoming, and homey. The vibrant, fluffy bedding was cheerful and comfortable. I almost got lost in all of the pillows. I was actually inspired by the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and would love for my home to look like this room. There was a privacy divider between the entryway and the bedroom part of the room. In the entryway, there was a console table, coffee maker, and mini-fridge. Wifi is free and the alarm clock had an iPod dock. The bathroom was spacious, including a very large countertop on the sink vanity. Aveda products were complimentary. Unlike most hotels, the room included ample mirrors with a large anti-fog mirror in the bathroom, and a full-length mirror on the closet door. The closet was stocked with plenty of wooden hangers, an iron and full ironing board, and a safe on the shelf that was large enough to fit our laptops, SLR cameras, etc. Most exciting for my husband, our window had a perfect view into Petco Park. Lucky for him, the Padres played four home games while we were in town. We attended one game and he was able to catch portions of the others from our room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s window. The rooftop bar on the ninth floor also has an excellent view of the stadium. We did not eat any meals at the hotel, as there were too many delicious restaurants to try while we were in town. If I had to offer a negative, my only complaint would be that housekeeping was slow to clean our room. The first day, it was cleaned by early afternoon. The other two days, we had to call and ask for service as it had not been cleaned by about 3pm and we were heading out for the afternoon/evening.

Melissa ultimately found a service that would take Milo out for a walk. While at the hotel, we were provided doggie food and water bowls.

Citing a lack of authority to uphold our contract (through three levels of staff) I was repeatedly urged to pay, leave and dispute it later. Eventually, they said they'd call with a decision as to whether they would charge me. The front desk clerk was rude (actually waved away my comment that housekeeping didn't clean my room one night) and she wandered off and left us at the desk after Travel Planners called the front desk to tell them they were obligated not to charge us. It took two hours before they finally agreed to abide by the contract - and they complained to us that they had \"issues\" with the travel company as if I should be involved in that. It was a horrible end to our trip and a short-sighted money grab as we are frequent travellers who will never go to any Hotel Indigo again. Oh yeah, the night before we left they slipped a flyer under our door trying to get us to stay the night we'd cancelled for $99 - but were insisting we pay $300+ for not staying.

I've stayed at many hotels in the downtown Gaslamp including the brilliant Manchester Grand Hyatt, but this is why Hotel Indigo keeps me coming back: --#1 Dog Friendly and they mean it. No dog fees. --Staff, like Peyton and Sergio who call you by name, greet you each time you walk in and pet your dog. --Views - PETCO park, the city, rooftop deck. When PETCO is not having a game you can take your dog there. --Location - Cannot beat it, but don't complain about noisy partyers! Bars/restaurants are so dog friendly. Try MaryJanes, Dick's Last Resort, Rockin' Baja, East Village Tavern and Bowl, Tin Fish, Omni's McCormick & Schmick - all love dogs! --Convenience - 7Eleven is on the corner, but don't even think about buying alcohol during a game (or two hours before). A little patch of grass for dogs is on the 9th floor, but my dog will not use it. Going left around PETCO park has tons of grass (so does behind the Omni). --Rooms - trendy and tasteful, nice amenities like Keurig coffee maker --Priority Club - they treat you like an exclusive club, with little treats like bottled water, mini cupcakes, jellybeans or nuts - it's been different each time but such a delight. --Price- for the area, the price is right. AAA and other types of discounts help out. They have little packages too like prepaid parking. Follow them on twitter for special rates - I've gotten rates as low as $99. Small \"cons\" -- no refrigerators -- no pool, ok they have a dog pool but not a people pool. Se and Hotel Solamar have rooftop pools. --parking, $35 or $18 with hybrid - but that's about the going rate around the area I've told a bunch of friends about Hotel Indigo after a friend of ours with a big dog recommended it.

When I presented our Priority Club card and had mentioned we were in town celebrating my birthday, Dieter graciously upgraded our room to a city view corner suite. Nice way to start our vacation! Our 12th floor suite was spectacular! The room was huge, large floor to ceiling windows on two walls looked out over distant mountains, the Coronado Island bridge, the skyline of San Diego and into PETCO Park. Too bad the Padres were away during our visit, we could have watched the game from our room. The room was very inviting, nicely decorated, the king bed covered in a colorful graphic duvet, with large oversize pillows. The bed had luxurious linens and was very comfy. All wood floors gave the room a warm, clean look and feel. A Keurig K-cup coffee maker stocked with upscale coffees and teas was welcome. The bath had a huge frameless glass surround, walk in shower supplied with Aveda bath products - a very nice touch. The 9th floor has an outdoor observation deck with a bar to serve up libations. Yes, they have a happy hour featuring different specials daily. The bar served a couple of local craft beers on tap and the margaritas were awesome!

The valet service was pleasant and quick; I never had to wait long for my car.

The bathroom is modern and attractive, with a very roomy shower, plenty of towels, and a great hair dryer. My only criticism would be that, despite the \"green\" emphasis and request that guests re-use towels (which is always fine with me), there was only one towel hook -- not a rack or bar anywhere -- making it pretty difficult to dry towels for re-use. In-room coffee was the \"cup at a time\" system, and the maid did keep me well supplied with coffee pods... but I find it wasteful and silly to generate plastic trash for every cup of coffee. Again, this is a hotel which prides itself on its LEED certification, so I find that perplexing. There was good closet space, plenty of real hangers, an IPod docking station, free WiFi, an in-room safe, and a free business center in the lobby. The decor was cool and attractive, there was good natural light, and a window that actually opened -- rare in hotels. I also appreciated the security of the keycard-controlled elevator.

The restaurant in the hotel has sparse, relatively expensive menus. That really isn't much of a problem given the abundance of restaurants within easy walking distance. We particularly valued The Broken Yolk for breakfast, at which you can also receive a 10% discount if you show your Hotel Indigo key.

They are 100% pet friendly and my dog was very comfortable staying here. Dogs are allowed in EVERY part of the hotel including the bar and restaurant area. I booked a King City View Room and requested a high floor for $135.00 a night. Upon arrival the valet was exceptionally friendly, they were very professional and really went above and beyond my expectations. Upon check in i was greeted by a front desk employee.. don't remember his name, i think it was Deider, anyway he was VERY UNPLEASANT. He didn't say hello, didn't give me any information about the hotel, or anything in the surrounding area, didn't tell me that there would be a $75.00 AUTHORIZATION HOLD on my credit card for incidentals , and he didn't really seem to throw a smile or be happy to have a job, or even be alive for that matter. He was kind of rude and just bitter as he handed me my hotel keys and credit card back. (Seriously if you hate your job that much and are in a bad mood, there are plenty of other people who are up beat and have a personality who can do his job 100 times better) anyway, we checked in and to my surprise was on the 11th floor. I thought the hotel only had 9 levels so this was a surprise (they have 12). The room was exceptional, very spacious, very clean, very modern, and overall A+. As part of bringing a dog to the hotel they offer a ruff life package according to their website where a dog bowl, and dog bed are provided. This was not so I called the front desk and got the same jerk who checked me in and he never followed up with me, it took an hour to get a dog bowl. Anyway on a positive note - EVERYTHING about this hotel is great, all the staff was very nice and friendly (other than the first guy). Housekeeping was a bit on the poor side, it took 1/2 hour to get towels, 1/2 hour to get anything and I had to request maid service. I mentioned this to the front desk upon checkout and to my surprise for the inconvenience they credited me $35.00 (one day) toward the valet parking. I recommend the Valet, it is $35.00 per night but totally worth it, yes there are other lots on the street for $10-$15 less, but they go unmanned at night and anything can happen. This hotel is literally within walking distance to 5th Avenue and Market St. which all the nightlife is on, there are a ton of bars, restaurants, hookah lounges, cigar lounges, coffee shops and so much culture and is very exciting and ALIVE during the day and after 5pm. It is a very quick 10 minute drive to Ocean Beach (Dog Friendly Off Leash Beach), Sea World and other beaches in the area. The hotel is also one block away from PetCo field where the Padres play, and you can get a great view of the game from the Hotel's 9th Level Rooftop Bar for free. The area south to the hotel (East of 11th Avenue) known as \"the east village\" is kind of sketchy, but it looks as the neighborhood is upcoming. Overall, I'd stay here again, they took care of my problems and always greeted me when i returned back to the hotel with a smile and a hello...even at 2AM. Even the Valet remembered where i was going and asked me how was the beach, how was the bar etc. If you are looking for a good walking distance to all the nightlife and culture, this modern hotel is definitely the place. On my last night there, i was surprised to find in my room under my door an invitation to stay an extra night at $99.00. This is something I have never seen before anywhere else and if I had the extra time to spare i should would have taken them up on their offer as I could have used another day in San Diego. Excellent Customer Service other than the jerk who checked me in at the beginning. I am happy that my overall experience was redeemed by everyone else and his attitude at the beginning didn't leave me with a negative impression of hotel and it's service.

We stayed because my wife had earned free night through an ICH promotion that expired at the end of the month. The rooms themselves were nice. The terrace that overlooked Petco Park - divine (Padres were on the road during our stay). The workout room was great - and for the Californiat types, there was even a Meditation Terrace. I have ZERO issues with the accomodations. The staff? Pretty much every interaction was a negative one. It wasn't like they were rude - they just appeared to be undermotivated and rules bound. Issue #1 - Check in. My wife is a very frequent ICH guest, on her way to Platinum status this year. We also aren't partying youngsters, so we find that being on the \"Elite\" floors keeps the wilder partiers away. So we asked for elite floor and was told they didn't have one (which is hard to believe given the size). To make matters worse, they put us in a room where there was a door between the rooms - which vibrates sound from the room next door. And of course, the wild partiers ended up next door. We called security, but much sleep was lost. Issue #2 - The next morning we went to the front desk and asked about our neighbors - were they checking out, would they fill that room that night etc. All kinds of unclear answers. Finally we just asked to be moved (this was at 7:45am) but mentioned we had a critical place we needed to cab to by 8am. Could we leave our stuff in the room, and change rooms at 1pm? Nope. They made us pack up and get out right there. So of course we miss our 8am meeting time. Aren't hotels supposed to make things more convenient? For the record, the room they moved us to had no door to the adjoining room - an improvement. But another very, very loud floor with doors slamming all night long. Issue #3 - We were on the terrace Saturday with a great bottle of wine, enjoying the weather. The bartender saw us come on with both the wine and our glasses and said nothing to us. So we made plans to do the same on Sunday. We stepped out with a beer and were having a great conversation with some fellow Texans. Suddenly out of nowhere an employee appears and tells us all to leave - that outside beverages weren't allowed on the terrace. When I tell him that they were allowed yesterday, even blessed by the bartender, he said the bartender \"was new\" and didn't know what he was talking about. Huh?!?!? I later learned (see Issue #4) that \"new\" seems to be the term tossed around for all customer errors made at the Indigo. The sad part was that we would have stayed on the terrace and talked - but the guy was so abrupt - and of course, even in late afternoon, the terrace bar was not yet open. So we were pretty much forced to leave. Truly wished I have gotten that jerk's name. Issue #4 - Upon returning home I see a significant charge on my credit card. Despite staying on free nights, we were charged as if they had never seen the freecertificates. The Front Desk Manager, Darin (one guy who has excellent customer skills, btw) said he would issue a refund. We haven't seen it yet, so let's hope we don't need to escalate this. Again the reason for failure? The person checking us in \"was new\" and messed up. Bottom line: Great, great property. Nice location with places off the Gaslamp Quarter that are less touristy (don't miss The Mission for coffee and breakfast, The Neighborhood for lunch and beers). Hotel a bit noisy - and no matter how hard we tried (we'd be the ones waking YOU up at 6am) the doors shut very loud. Service needs a tuning up - asking to be in a quiet place, having a drink where you are allowed one day and denied the next, getting your bill right. We weren't asking for much.

When we arrived at Hotel Indigo we were greeted by Ellen, a helpful and friendly front desk employee. We were upgraded to a suite but when we arrived in the room there were a few issues that became somewhat of a hassle to get resolved. First off, I went to take a shower & the water temperature was basically luke warm. The water temp was rectified after one phone call to the front desk. We came back after a quick walk through the gaslamp quarter and found that the problem with our shower was fixed but now the toilet wouldn't flush, again with the phone call to the front desk & another maintenance visit. With all that said, everyone was extremely helpful and understanding about how frustrated we were & they did everything in their power to correct the problem. From then on we had a fantastic stay in a beautiful room with great staff. The happy hour on the rooftop bar was great and Adriana in hotel lobby bar was friendly and warm.

It's a bit further from the Harbor activities but not an impossible walk. The rooms are very nicely done --larger than most hotels at that price range--modern, restful decor both in the rooms and the lobby; clean. We were on the 6th floor but it was somewhat noisy down on the street at least until 2am but then you are in the middle of an entertainment area in a big city so to be expected. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from both Petco and it's on the edge of Gaslamp. The service throughout the hotel, with one exception, is excellent. Check in and out is great (special commendation to Darren the desk manager who was particularly nice, as was the other lady at the front desk when we left). My wife left her purse in the bar the night before we left, and we didn't notice it until the next morning. She called down and it was delivered to our room immediately. So the hotel in general is a very good value and very pleasant. The one exception on service and value is the breakfast restaurant (near the bar). First, there is very limited choice on eggs--scrambled, scrambled, or scrambled in various forms. No choice. Second . We came down for bkfst within the specified serving times on a Sunday morning. No one was there to seat us, so we just sat down at a table. There were 4 waiters and maybe 8 tables filled so it wasn't very busy or full. We waited 10 minutes for service and then it wasn't the waiter who came over to take our order but the great Darren who from the front desk noticed we had not gotten served and took it upon himself to come over and take our order. On the way out same thing happened--we asked for the check and waited. And waited. One waiter passed our table and indicated it was coming. It didn't. We don't know what the restaurant manager was doing at the bar but he wasn't getting our check. Finally 10 minutes after we asked for it, we looked over and even he had disappeared as had all the other waiters! So we just got up, left and told Darren at the front desk what we were doing and to just add any charges to our bill b/c we were tired of waiting. They did. And when I told the other lady at the desk on check out what happened, she very nicely did the right thing and as compensation took our bar bill from the last night off the final bill. So we highly recommend this hotel to stay at--excellent value and service. Just don't eat breakfast at the hotel and you'll really like it.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kscartac", "Title": "\u201cElegant, modern, and relaxing place to stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "Kscartac", "ReviewID": "UR109105729", "Content": "A friend and I stayed here and could not have been more pleased!

I was given a corner room on the 7th floor with a great view of Petco Park. The front desk staff was very friendly and greeted us everytime we entered the hotel. We didn't bring our dog, but this would be an excellent place to do so. There aren't a lot of grassy areas in the urban surroundings to take your dog for a pottie break. However, you don't even need to leave the hotel for this, as the 9th floor outdoor area has a grassy pet relief area. The 9th floor also has a workout area with several ellptical machines, treadmills, and a stationary bike. There is even a private meditation deck. The rooms are nicely appointed. The free wifi was very fast every time I used it. There is only 1 small draw back to the hardwood floors, it can be a little noisy if someone in high heel shoes walks around in the room above you. I discovered this one morning at 6 AM, but quickly returned to back to sleep. Parking is a little on the high side, but since I got the room for free it was easier to overlook. Plus we went to a Padres game one night so we just walked from the hotel and didn't have to pay to park at the stadium. The valet staff was friendly and always had our car out front in a matter of minutes. Its a short and easy drive to the harbor and zoo from the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants within easy walking distances of the hotel in the gaslamp district. If you are looking for a good breakfast option, I'd recommend Cafe 222. You can even walk to the harbor area if you aren't opposed to a 20 minute or so walk. We felt very safe doing so. All in all this is a very nice place to stay in the gaslamp district.

A window that opened so we could take advantage of the cool San Diego breeze! We were on the 2nd floor right over the bar and lobby on a Saturday night and our room was very very quiet. I was a little bit worried that because our window overlooked the valet parking stand and we were right over the bar that I'd hear noise, but once we closed the door, it was super quiet. I can only assume the walls have lots and lots of insulation. I was also expecting noise because of the (beautiful) hard wood floors, but not a peep (or thud or click) from the room above us. We went to a game at Petco and walked one block to get into the stadium. We didn't eat in the restaurant, so can't comment on food quality. Staff was super friendly. The ONLY downside was the $35 valet parking fee. I live in Los Angeles, so expect to pay something, but I thought it was a bit overpriced. If you're planning on going to a game, you probably want to factor in the convenience factor. Petco Park charges $15 - so for another $20, you can walk to the park in one block. And then walk back to your room in under 3 minutes and not have to worry about getting your car out of the Petco lot and get back to your room. Is it worth it? Depends on your frugality factor.

The bartenders/servers Adriana, William, Ish- all fo them- make you feel welcome, take the time to listen to what you like and make the best drink recommendations based on what you offer up. Love that! Now, to compare this hotel to say, Hard Rock, near the convention center is almost unfair! It's literally like night and day. Also, any hotel near the convention center deals with the trolley and train ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT! I can't tell you how many of my colleagues had sleepless nights because of that alone! Other great things to note about Hotel Indigo are that it's pet-friendly (although I only saw dogs), they have great specials throughout the week, and the stadium (Petco Park) is just a block away! They do offer valet parking for $35 a day but there is street parking available some times, too, just beware you're on the right side due to street cleaning! (San Diego is so clean!) All in all- a wonderful spot. I was on the 10th floor- the room was spacious and cheery! The beds are super comfy (four pillows to each bed and they are soooo soft and fluffy!) They don't always get the shampoo/conditioner/coffee stocked consistently, but that can be fixed by making a simple call down to the front desk.", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cVery poor experience...\u201d", "Author": "CBridgeGirl", "ReviewID": "UR103281286", "Content": "Checked in and room not clean (dirty rag on table and someone else's razor cap in shower)...

I don't even know where to start. On our arrival there, we were promptly greeted by the valet and shown to the front desk. This is where we met David Ornelas. He was absolutely key in making our stay here at the Hotel Indigo a wonderful one. We were able to get an upgrade on our room since we mentioned it was our first year anniversary and we had a wonderful surprise of a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate upon our return to the room later that night! When first walking into our room, we were totally taken aback by the beauty of it. It was simultaneously modern and inviting. The hardwood floors were beautiful and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've had the pleasure of sleeping in. The TV was HUGE, which was a big plus for my husband and I loved the oversized chair and ottoman in the corner. The bathroom was immaculate. We loved the shower and size and the large amount of counter space for all your stuff!! We checked in on Friday, but our anniversary was on Saturday. After a full day of shopping and checking out Balboa Park, we returned to the hotel to see what kind of restaurant recommendations the front desk could offer us. Fortunately, David was working again and him and another helpful person recommended many restaurants which catered our every need (seafood, on 5th, patio seating). We decided on Asti for a nice italian dinner and David was able to make us reservations for that night. The dinner was amazing and our server had a little tip off that it was our anniversary. After dinner, we headed up for a relaxing nightcap at the rooftop bar for wonderful views of the city and great conversation. We are thoroughly pleased with our stay at the Hotel Indigo. Thanks to the entire staff that made our stay so memorable, but a special thanks to David O.

Indigo is an very upscale version of the funky South Beach hotels -- very bright colors and open environment, but much cleaner and more comfortable than South Beach. Room is good size, plenty of window, very comfortable bed, spotless bathroom. Hotel is quiet (or soundproof, either way works). Staff is pleasant, and efficient, if not too friendly. Downstairs/lobby bar/restaurant is adequate. Only had breakfast there Saturday morning. It was \"okay\". Bartender serving it was pleasant. Yes. Valet parking is expensive. But, this is San Diego, and this is downtown. Deal with it. Fast WiFi available throughout the hotel. Superb property location. 5th & 6th Avenues are the downtown hot spots and the hotel is 4 blocks away, bay is about 12 blocks as is Little Italy. Easy walk. Neighborhood has lots of homeless, but they are not obtrusive nor threatening. Do not be intimidated walking to or from the hotel at night. San Diego's urban development is moving east. The restaurants & bars & clubs are expanding past 6th to 7th. It will only get better for the Indigo as the area around is built up and redeveloped. PS-1: Choose a restaurant on 5th Avenue but be not put off by the mobs of people. There are plenty of restaurants to get seated at, even on Saturday night. PS-2: Pay attention the drink prices if you go into one of the clubs. I paid over $20 for 2 glasses of wine at one. That's more ridiculous than the lobby bar in the Marriotts. Not so great stuff about the Indigo (hence my 4 stars): 1. Be prepared to wait for your car if you valet park. Valet car recovery is very very slow. 2. INEXCUSABLE for this hotel. The wonderful bar on the 9th floor is a great spot to just sit or meet. Good view. It has a great happy hour. BUT, it serves you wine and drinks in cheap little half sized PLASTIC cups! It's like getting a beer at a beach bar! I thought at first there was some sort of municipal restriction on glass containers on rooftops in San Diego, but, the other hotels have rooftop bars and serve drinks in real glass! What an amateur thing for the Indigo to do. Imagine your delightful Pinot Griggio served in a plastic cup! Talk about popping a bubble. How romantic! Ah! Nothing like the taste of plastic on a warm San Diego evening! Glad I didn't order champagne. Those are small (but notable) gripes. The hotel, as a hotel -- place to stay and sleep -- is first class. Location is truly ideal. Hotel is very clean and neat.

The outside bar has a couple firepits which made the experience even better. Try the Karl Strauss Red Trolley Beer upstairs and the Karl Strauss WindAndSea downstairs. Incredible local brewery. The exercise room in the hotel is out of this world. A gym which is full of commercial grade LifeFitness products including weights, eliptical and two 95ti Treadmills which are in my opinion is the best in the business. BUT...when you are in San Diego, there is no reason to stay on a treadmill. There is no pool and whirlpool which did not effect me in the least but some families may need a pool etc. The rooms are very spacious and have free Internet access. The TV's were at least 42 inches and flat screens. The room had hardwood floors which I have never seen before but added a great modern feel.

My husband decided to book a hotel last minute through hotwire and we got lucky with Hotel Indigo for about $130 for a Saturday night. We didn't have any intentions to take our 4 1/2 year old puggle with us, but once we saw that she could stay for FREE (NO additional pet fee like most other hotels) she convinced us that she should come along for her first hotel stay. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff, especially SERGIO, was very friendly and made Gigi's first hotel stay so much fun. As far as the room, you can't beat the size for being in downtown. RATINGS: Cleanliness was 4 only because of a bit of dust. We informed the front desk, but decided it didn't bother us to the point that it needed to be taken care of. Sleep Quality got a 4 only because a loud car drove by late at night that could be heard even on 11th floor, beds were extremely comfortable so that made up for it. FLOOR: Laminate wood with an area rug. BED: Very comfortable, inbetween firm and soft. Pillows are very soft and fluffy. Gigi liked to hide under the bed so make sure you check under the beds for lost items. BATHROOM: Spacious with a Large shower (no tub). 1 sink with plenty of counter space. Aveda bath products are provided. VIEW: Floor to ceiling windows to admire the city view. ETC: Nice LG tv, but no mini fridge. iHome dock in room too. SUPER pet friendly! Gigi was able to go to the 9th floor and see the bar/lounge, grass patch, eat breakfast with us in their restaurant, and she got to run through the hallway. Petco Park's Park at the Park is only a 3 minute walk from the hotel which was open for her to take care of business and socialize with other dogs too. This hotel has APPLE products in the lobby :) REGRETS: Didn't get to try any happy hour specials...maybe next time! Starbucks, Basic (for pizza and they deliver to the hotel too), 7-11, Quizno's are all on the same block as the hotel.

I coordinated an event in San Diego, with attendees arriving from all over the country. From the day we arrived, the staff showed nothing but excellent service. Here are some employees that absolutely stand out in my mind as having gone above and beyond for me and my colleagues: - David (the shorter one), at the front desk, did an excellent job of taking care of all the attendees during check-in. He ensured that they were all checked-in in a timely manner and provided them information that was pertinent to our event. - Adriana (Bar Manager) ensured that her staff was well aware of our group's reception/ice-breaker and always checked in with me to make sure everything was going well. Michelle was the bartender that took great care of us on the 9th Floor Lounge; and William was the primary bartender in the afternoons, at the main bar downstairs, who took care of group orders for those who chose to partake in a beverage after our meetings. These two were not only great employees but had a great personalities. Remember the names of members of my group was a true sign of how much they enjoy their work and the guests. - Derick (Director of Food and Beverage) worked with me in arranging a procedure where the transition between meeting to lunch was seamless, by taking advanced orders and ensuring that the wait for food orders was minimized. - Michael did an excellent job in attending members that ordered their breakfast from the restaurant and also did an excellent job in assisting Derick in getting lunch out in a timely manner. - Adrian, from Banquets, made contact with me on the first day we were going to use the meeting rooms and was very attentive in our needs for our AM and PM service and AV needs. Matt assisted him in getting the room set up and ensured everything was always stocked. - And last but not least, there is Kelsey, Sales Manager. Kelsey worked with me for over 2 months in ensuring our meeting was a great success. Not only did she endure several emails and phone calls from me, but was also asked to work with my California reps in coordinating the reception/ice-breaker. Kelsey was the key figure in the hotel. Not only did she ensure that all of the employees I mentioned, were made aware of our group, but also other employees within the hotel. Throughout the time we were there, my group members were coming up to me to tell me of their positive experience with all members of the hotel staff, and how throughout the stay everyone in the group felt like they were treated as VIPs. Due to my job, I've stayed in hotels ranging from no-star to 5-star and without a doubt, this hotel made me feel more of a valued guests than any other. The attentiveness, personalities and care felt genuine and sincere. Whereas other hotels felt more like it was just \"part of the job\" to be nice. This is the epitome of what the hospitality industry should be. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning on visiting San Diego, and I know that I will be staying here again in the future, regardless of whether it's for business or pleasure.

I stayed at the Hotel Indigo in the Gaslamp Quarter at the beginning of November 2010 for 6 nights. My wife was at a conference at the Convention Center and I decided to work out of the hotel room. I had read reviews on TripAdvisor that mentioned others being able to check in earlier than the 3 pm check-in time and thought I'd ask beforehand. I called the night before and was told that not all rooms were booked and might be able to check in early the next morning since my wife's conference started at 9 am. After I dropped off my wife and gave the hotel a call. Kimberly told me that they were all booked and to call back at noon to see if any rooms were available then. I called back at 12:30 pm and Kimberly told me that they were still all booked and the room I had requested was still occupied and the person had requested a late check out. I found it hard to believe that no other rooms were available, but I thought \"sure, I get it, technically the check-in time is 3 pm and hopefully they will extend the same courtesy to me when I request a late check out on our last day.\" When I finally was able to check in at 4 pm, I was told by the valet guy that the bell hop was not available and I could wait, but I decided to check in regardless because I had such a long day already. Carrying more bags and equipment than I could handle, no one at the front desk even offered to help me after handing me the keys to the room. The next day, I realized that I needed to vacate the room for a couple of hours so that housekeeping could clean the room and decided on an extended lunch from 12-2 pm. When I came back, the room had still not been cleaned, but I needed to get work done, so I realized we just had to go without a clean room for a night. The next day, I left at 11 am and told the front desk of the situation and they said the room would be cleaned by the time I got back. At 3 pm, I went back to my room and the \"cleaning service requested\" sign was still on my door handle, I went to the front desk and complained about how it had been 4 hours and no one had cleaned the room. They apologized and said that I was next on the list, so I went to the lounge for about 30 minutes. When I returned, the room had finally been cleaned and I thought this would be over with. The next day, the same thing happened... over the course of our stay, our room had only been cleaned 3 times. The front desk didn't even communicate our request to the cleaning staff. Fast forward to the last day. I was told by Peyton at the front desk that 11 am was the check-out time, so I requested an extension given that one had been granted to whoever stayed in our room previously and that resulted in me checking in after 3 pm on the first day. Peyton said \"maybe we can give you to 11:30 or noon at the latest because we are expecting a full house.\" Nice, I thought. Now, I'm a reasonable person, I realize there are official times for check-in and check-out - I get it. However, for there to be very little flex is ridiculous... if I can wait until 3 pm for check in, why can't someone else and why can't the front desk just go the extra mile and say: \"Listen, we have a full house, but here's what I can do. I will give you until 1 or 2 pm... just make sure you let me know when you're going to check out so I can get the cleaning staff into the room as soon as possible. How does that sound?\" Now, that would be service... unfortunately, you won't find that at the Hotel Indigo in San Diego. Regarding their room service: my wife ordered $40 worth of dinner (which she said was terrible quality, btw - I had read about this in previous reviews). She was astounded at the bad service she got. We didn't have any menus in our room, so she asked the room service people to give her some options, to which they responded \"Um, it's really hard to tell you what we have if you don't have a menu.\" She thought, why is it my fault there's no menu in my room? And then when they finally arrived, they asked, \"where do you want me to put this\" and just dropped the tray on the bed. Nice. Finally, the Valet: after leaving the car in the garage for 3 days, I was surprised to find a distinct sewer smell in my car. The valet guys had told me that the hotel had been working on the smell, but even after a night of driving and airing out the car, the smell lingered. The same thing happened the next day and I finally realized that I should close the vents in the car, which helped. But after complaining to the Valet, they said they would let their manager know and that I should also speak to the front desk, who immediately blamed the Valet guys. Again, no help from the front desk. Anyway, one of the Valet guys told their manager and he spoke with the GM who eventually compensated all of my parking charges, which was a nice gesture. Another note, even though Valet parking is expensive at $32/day, I knew that going into the situation and I realized that it was worth it for the security and convenience. Plus, the Valet guys were very nice and I think they even felt bad about how much they were charging, so they were extra friendly. Anyway, I thought if the front desk was half as friendly and helpful as the Valet guys, I would have had a much more pleasant experience. Bottom line: The front desk (Kimberly and Peyton) were not very helpful... I got pat answers and nothing remotely resembling actual troubleshooting and service. Actually, there were 2 people that stood out from the rest: Bruce and Dieter... they actually were helpful and at least provided other alternatives for my needs. The Valet was expensive, but they know it and provide great service. I was disappointed because I had heard that the service was very friendly, but I didn't find that to be the case... at most times, it seemed unprofessional, run by young trainees, and not helpful at all.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBig rooms at this boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mailmanwill", "ReviewID": "UR85764803", "Content": "Prompt check in and very friendly staff at the Indigo.

There are usually all sorts of rules and regulations, and fees, and it's just a bit stressful. Hotel Indigo is really different - they genuinely welcome dogs. No fees, no restrictions, and they actually looked happy to see our dog at check in! There is a little park a block away right in front of Petco Park where dogs run off leash. Also, the hotel obviously goes to great pains to ensure that the hotel does not feel doggy - it is immaculate, and very stylish. For once, our dog actually enjoyed her weekend away too.

I like to stay close to the Gaslamp because everything is walking-distance and the only hotel that I'll stay at is the Hotel Indigo! First of all, you can't ask for a better location. From my hotel window, I could see clearly into Petco Park. A walk to the bars was less than 5 minutes, yet it was far enough so that I was never dodging night owls when I stepped outside. There was also a great coffee shop (pet friendly too!) called Java Jones that was less than a block away. When I walked in, I was greeted by one of the the pleasant staff members behind the counter. The hotel itself is beautiful. The contemporary decor - with its greens, blues, beige and orange - gives the hotel a comfortable yet upscale feeling. In the front lobby there was a waterfall display, couches where I lounged as I waited for my friends, a full bar with great original cocktails, and computers so I could check my email for free. I heard that they have live music at the hotel on certain nights and offer happy hour specials too. The rooms itself were clean and bright with hardwood floors. It's a huge plus that the hotel is pet friendly! The bed was nice, big shower w/ a wooden stool, Aveda bath products, flat screen TV, an iHome alarm clock so I could plug in my iPod, and a Keurig coffee maker. The Keurig is such a nice touch! An added bonus was also the free wifi in the hotel room. If I ever needed to go for a quick run on the treadmill, there was a gym with nice, new equipment and also an awesome outdoor patio with bar and fire pits. Honestly, I never spent more than 20 minutes in the gym, but spent all night at the outdoor bar/patio. I must say that the best part about the hotel is the staff. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. The last time, I brought my dog and the staff was so kind to him! They had water bowls for him outside and doggie treats for him to munch on. It was the first time that he had traveled away from home and apparently he wasn't keen on staying in the room alone. While I was out at Del Mar, I got a call from the front desk manager saying that his barking was causing our neighbor to file a noise complaint. With my permission, the front desk manager took my pooch out of the room and let him stay down at the front desk until I returned five hours later! He was as happy as a clam there! I'm not trying to advertise dogsitting services because the hotel doesn't offer it, but the fact that they went out of their way to calm him and their other guests truly made me and my dog feel special! They go ABOVE and BEYOND to ensure that their guests are happy and satisfied!!! I have never stayed anywhere where the staff goes beyond the call of duty like that.

Having recently stayed at some of the Indigo's local competitors, I wouldn't be so quick to pick this property in the future over the others. The hotel is exceedingly well decorated in a trendy style that is comfortable despite its chic appearance. It's kind of like staying in a W Hotel without the attitude that sometimes accompanies a W stay. However, this hotel's management would do well to study some of what W Hotels do well in terms of offering friendly and personalized service. Parking is a real pain point. Because of the location immediately in front of Petco Park stadium and next to the Gaslamp quarter, street parking is often not an option. Meters run Mon-Sat until 6 pm and only allow 2-hour maximum stay. Garages and pay lots are available nearby but are no great bargain. This forces one to consider the $32 a night valet service. Unfortunately $32 doesn't buy very much in the service. I called down to the valet station to have my car pulled up (no direct line, must go through the Hotel operator) and didn't get an answer either time. The 2nd time this happened I complained to the front desk who promised to alert the valet to pull up my car. I came downstairs 10 minutes later and still waited 15 minutes for my car when I was in an awful hurry to get to a wedding. The valet manager was very unconvincing when he apologized and said that they were very busy - I was one of 2 people waiting for my car during this period. I ended up having that night's parking comped by the front desk manager. I also learned that the hotel uses an outside vendor for the parking service. I strongly recommend that they dump this vendor. The Phi Lounge on the 9th floor balcony is a beautiful spot with a great view into Petco Park stadium. Unfortunately the lounge was staffed by a single unsmiling drone bartender who do never left the back of the bar to take orders and needed me to repeat my order three times. The food in the lobby bar/lounge is very good - especially the sweet potato fries and sliders. The service was also marginally better here, possibly because it's in view of the front desk managers. The rooms are very comfortable and well insulated against outdoor noise. Having said that, the walls are a little thin and the echo of high heels from the 3 women staying in the next room on the parquet wood floor was annoying. Since I stayed on the top floor, I don't know if overhead noise from the wood floor is an issue for downstairs neighbors. The bathrooms are nicely decorated with a spacious shower. However, water pressure is a problem at times. I reported this to management and within 5 minutes an engineer visited my room and then went to reset a pump. This gave me enough pressure to shower, but I wouldn't ever recommend this hotel to someone who likes a good strong shower. There is no fridge in the rooms of any kind, however there are excellent Keurig one-cup coffee makers and safes in the room's closet. Check your bill really carefully upon checkout because mine still contained the parking charge for the night that was to have been comped. The bill was adjusted but the manager should have really taken care of that when he originally promised. Additionally, I was charged for a $5 water bottle placed in the room that I never touched. Overall, I'd call this hotel a 3-star hotel masquerading as a 4-star hotel. For a few dollars more a night, I'd prefer to stay at the W and be pampered a little.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "scoll82", "ReviewID": "UR78252138", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for three nights in August.

According to the front desk clerk, Dieter, he saw her get off the elevator and run towards the lobby doors. She ran through them and down the street crossing two major throughfares to PETCO stadium park. The Dieter ran after her. He finally caught up with her in a Seven-Eleven convenience store and brought her back to the hotel. He locked her up in a sales office however she managed to open THAT door a couple of times before I arrived. Needless to say, I was amazed and astonished that: 1. She opened the door to my room. Now anyone that knows Angel knows that she can open my doors at home. However, didn't THINK that she could manage a commercial hotel room door! 2. She got into the elevator and was able to make it downstairs. The front desk clerks watched the security video tape and said that she went straight to the elevator banks and waited until the doors opened. The big question is: HOW DID SHE HIT THE DOWN BUTTON??? 3. Angel and I had just gone to Petco Stadium that morning for a walk and had stopped in the 7-11 store to get a drink. Guess she thought I was still there! 4. Last but certainly not least, she managed NOT to get run over in busy San Diego traffic! She has become quite the sensation around here at Hotel Indigo... I'm just hoping to get her back to Colorado in one piece. And now a BIG plug for this hotel: everyone here has bent over backwards for me and Angel... they love dogs here and completely cater to them.

It was noisy, though, there was sound leakage coming from unknown places, and they have to remedy this somehow. The location is perfect, walking distance to the main drag, on a pleasant , very energetic part of town. What sets them apart, however, was their honesty and integrity. I had left an expensive watch on the bed upon checkout and discovered it was missing half a day later. They were too busy to check up on housekeeing the entire afternoon, but at night, one of the guys called me up to say they had located it and that I can pick it up anytime. I have to say, in my mind, I was ready to let the watch go, hoping it will benefit someone's useful life (sarcastically speaking), but was delightfully surprised to have found that housekeeping acted responsibly and did the right thing.

The location was about a block from Petco Park and a short walk to the Gaslamp district (lots of bars, restaurants, formerly home to 75 brothels-that was 50 years ago) and the Convention Center. This part of town was interesting. The hotel was great and only a couple years old however it was next to a small two story building that said \"Hotel\" on it. This place looked like it has been abandoned 40 years ago and it probably should have been. This part of town is still a work in process and there are many hotels just like this one. Apparently they were flop houses used by sailors back during WW ll and prior.

When making our room reservations, I happened to speak with the front desk supervisor. Dieter, was very helpful and his age (around my 26) made his suggestions perfect for a great night out. Upon arriving, the curb service was great with our bags and our dog. Among all the great Bell serviceman, Sergio was the most notable. He greeted our dog daily with the affection only dog lovers provide. Although I'm not as influenced by dog treats as my bulldog, Sergios friendliness quickly provided a sense of comfort as if we were guests at his own home. He even informed me of great places for doggy business within and around the hotel. Our rooms were amazing! The view of PETCO Park from the window was so perfect that I didn't have to go to the stadium to watch any games. Both rooms reserved had the same view of the stadium, were comfortably furnished with two queen beds, and side by side on the 8th floor.

So don't bring your kids to this hotel...its more for a getaway for couples.

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literature about how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sophisticated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it is, and although my own preference would be for less self-conscious glorification of trendiness, it is a beautifully decorated hotel with fresh bright linens on the beds, interesting light fixtures and paint, and large and gorgeous bathrooms. Still on the positives, we ate breakfast in the Phi restaurant twice and were favorably impressed with the service. On the other hand, staff training in some other areas needs some work. I found the front desk staff only minimally polite, a bit supercilious, even. This is unfortunate, since first impressions count for a lot and I want to feel that if I have to talk to the front desk staff about a problem, that they will be motivated to put it right. But after all, this is just my subjective impression and maybe some guests prefer a more aloof demeanor than I do. More seriously, our rooms were not thoroughly cleaned. For example, when we arrived in the room I sat down in the armchair and moved the footstool a few inches. What should I see but a wadded up used Kleenex on the floor that the housekeeping staff had missed? Yuck. Another housekeeping problem: the rooms had beautiful high-end coffee makers, but neither of our two rooms had a complete set of coffee making materials the first morning we woke up in the hotel. We had coffee in one room, but had to raid the coffee tray in the kids' room next door to get cream and sugar for my husband, who doesn't like black coffee. That was okay I suppose, since we had two rooms and could combine the supplies, although we would expect better in this class of hotel. But then after the housekeeping staff had serviced the rooms later that day, we found they had not cleaned the coffee maker or the cups, nor had they replenished the coffee, cream, or sugar in either room. So we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to use the coffee maker the second morning we were in the hotel. Housekeeping also didn't wash or replace the glasses we had used. Again, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the end of the world, but this is not a low-budget hotel and I expected better service for what we paid. This isn't a criticism, more an observation: families with young children do not appear to be a demographic that this hotel is targeting. We noted that while dogs were welcome in the restaurant, it didn't have a children's menu. We managed to find things on the menu everyone in our family could eat at breakfast, since our kids are old enough to do justice to adult portions and choices. But a few years ago nothing on the restaurant's menu would have been appealing to them, especially for lunch and dinner. All in all, this is an interesting hotel and it may be a great choice for some people.

For example, what hotel (2-star hotels included) does not provide on-demand offerings? Can someone, PLEASE tell me? The LaQuinta Inn perhaps? I've seen more choices on the menu of a high-school cafeteria. The menu is sparse. When you FINALLY decide on something to eat, you realize you've just spent a grip on a sample - at best. When it comes to toiletries, I don't know if the hotel is cheap or what, but you will come up short with towels, soap and such. Perhaps this is something that most hotels don't seem to get, but if you have TWO people staying in a room, it would be nice to provide for TWO. Also, it would be nice if they took time to clean the shower. The beds are not the most comfortable. However, this is relative. In summary, it's not the worst hotel. I would not say that. But, to claim to be a four-star hotel is a stretch. It takes more than pretty sheets and curtains. While four-star is NOT five-star, it does provide service offerings.

It has a great environment embracing all of the elements of nature: fire with great fire pits, water with a beautiful reflecting pool, earth with incredible stone work and air with the open air terrace. They also have a wonderful restaurant and bar on the first floor that has large full-wall windows that open up - so you can experience the wonderful San Diego weather! Another thing that wins my heart over - they are pet-friendly! There were many, many people with dogs in the hotel and the dogs are welcomed just as if they are a member of the family. They have a canine cocktail hour with happy hour specials for the two-legged guests and free dog cookies and bowls of water for the four-legged guests! I've never seen such happy pooches!
