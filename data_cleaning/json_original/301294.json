We came from Kyoto on the JR line and got off at Osaki station. You just have to walk across a pedestrian bridge and the Hotel is right there! Barely 2 minutes walk, even with bags.*So easy to get to any station on main JR loop line (eg: Tokyo, Shinjuku, Ueno).*The room had a view of river as well as good shutter to block out light in morning.*Standard toiletries in bathroom (shower/tub combo). Nice hot water and decent height.*Helpful front desk staff - they gave us maps, directions and once organised a taxi for us.*Didn't try breakfast (about $15).*100yen for 20-30mins on 2 (slow) computers in lobby.*Plenty of little eateries and fast food places right below hotel, including a big supermarket.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR340437163", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "danzmerv"}, {"Content": "\u6910\u546f\u6d3f\u7ef2\u6129\u4ef9\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4   showReview(23297839, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR198378224", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "\u9288\u5e7f\u5113\u9289\ue0fe\u5142\u9288\ue218\u5063"}, {"Content": "\u6e1a\u57ae\u57c4\u9287\u0443\u63e9\u95ac?#x201d;   showReview(20496642, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR184234108", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "pimpa-55"}, {"Content": "\u6fb6\u0443\u78f6\u6910\u546b\u20ac\u20ac\u95c6\u3123\u20ac\u20ac\u934c\u6a38\u4eb4\u9412\u00b0\u4eb8\u9287\ufe3a\u5010\u6fb6\u0442\u7b00\u6fb6?#x201d;   showReview(20356506, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR704020794", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "\u951d\u5b36\u7d87\u951d\u6136\u7d81\u951d?> \u951d\u5b36\u7d87\u951d\u6136\u7d81\u951d?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u934a\u3086\ue18c\u9429\u7a3f\u7e59   showReview(19171334, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR871148121", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u95ae\u6212\u7d30\u9287\ue042\u4f04\u9287\ue0a6\u6f64\u9287\u5b28\u4efe\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289?#x201d;   showReview(19164379, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR800031151", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066854-d301294-r20605119-New_Otani_Inn_Tokyo-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "301294", "Price": "$144"}}
