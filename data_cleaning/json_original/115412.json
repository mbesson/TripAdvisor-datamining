Unfortunately, when we arrived they were all out (they had four in the system). The manager made a few calls and had his staff scour the place for a crib that might have been overlooked. What they found was one that had been vomited on and was otherwise disgusting (the vomit stain was still visible). They did there best to clean it up, but nothing would change it's appearance as if it had been pulled from a dump. At that point sanitary concerns took over and in the end we didn't use the crib.

First thing I did after booking was read the reviews on Trip Advisor. Of course you get some good & some bad so I was open minded to find out for myself...Big Mistake!!! I'm a very easy spirited person & not a picky bone in my body, besides we only needed a place to sleep. The place didn't look bad when we pulled up (My younger Sis & Mother), neither did the front counter. The only thing noticed was the super strong smell of Chlorine in the dirty pool (as per my mother) but we weren't planning on swimming so no big deal. The guy (Amid?) can't remember his name, was very courteous. He asked us to wait one moment while he went to check the room. He came back & handed us the key. I felt all was well. However, as soon as you opened the door (Room 108) you immediately smelled the mold. As you walked in the room, you could see it EVERYWHERE!!! No joke. We turned around & told Amid we couldn't stay in that room. My chest as well as my Sister's was hurting from breathing in that strong odor. He told us he had one more room upstairs (Room 224) so we took the key & gave it another try. No mold but it smelled of Alcohol and urine (as my mother put it) and the bathroom pure urine. The smell was Horrible. At this point we were DONE!!! We went back and told him we are leaving. He apologized and gave us a cancellation # but said we would have to call to get our refund. It was late (close to 11pm) so he offered us the room for free stating that we would not be able to find a room anywhere else for the night. We declined! Not even for FREE!!! That's how Terrible the rooms were. We drove a few minutes down the street & stayed at Orlando Vista Hotel. What a BIG difference with less than $25 more per night. My advice: Spend the extra $ to ensure your safety as well as your health. A good night's sleep is priceless...in our case, just a few dollars more.

We needed to take our dog with us on this last-minute business trip, so we picked the Red Roof Inn and booked on hotels.com since it was the same price as the other affordable hotel that isn't pet friendly. We arrived and checked-in with no issues. The late-night attendant was very friendly throughout our stay and always took the time to say hey when he saw us passing by. When we arrived to our 2nd floor room, I noticed it was humid, even though the A/C was turned all the way up. So, we requested a new room and was moved next door with no questions asked. The A/C worked fine in the new room, plus it had the added bonus of a fridge, which was very handy. There is construction going on across the street on the back side of the hotel, but it didn't really bother us. I did notice that the pool side was a bit noisier at night because of Hwy 192 traffic. The room layout was typical for a budget hotel, but was still clean, although a bit damp. But you're in Florida, so that's to be expected in a hotel with outside entry. We didn't request housekeeping every day, but when we needed to just change out towels, the housekeeping staff was very quick to bring us new towels. We had to extend our stay last minute by a few days, so we booked a new reservation on Hotels.com for a extra days and had no problems getting the staff to allow us to remain in the same room. We didn't make use of the shuttle to any of the parks since we drove, so we can't really give a review on that. The breakfast was typical 'continental' breakfast style - packaged pastries/muffins, cereal, juice, and milk.

Better to fork over the big bucks and stay on property. But, if you have a car (and a pet), this place is a good choice. You can drive past an outlet mall and a walmart to enter disney through World Drive. This takes you to Downtown Disney , and avoids a lot of traffic. Turning to the right gets you onto I drive, which is convenient to Sea World, and Universal (and another outlet mall). You can avoid I-4 altogether, which is a plus.

I paid less than $32 before taxes for my most recent stay. There is a problem with dampness in some rooms, at least on the first floor which I prefer. I always check the room before unloading. I had to move both on this stay and my previous stay in May (not reviewed). The night clerk, Dmitri, was helpful both times. My second room was clean.

Maybe we had the worst room in the entire hotel, but it sounds like they were on an entirely different property. I often check the reviews on TripAdvisor and now strongly feel you should check how active a reviewer is on here. If they have just one review, be careful, I fear these may be paid, friends of the owners, or employees bumping the property up. Two friends and I planned a quick weekend to the Universal parks a week prior, so we did not do a lot of research ahead of time on where we would be staying. We only needed two things; a room to sleep at night and a shuttle that took us back and forth to the parks. Upon arriving at the hotel we notice a large amount of people just milling about, I assumed they might be waiting for the shuttles also. The lobby picture on this site is not true to reality, doctored or taken right after remodeling (as is the picture of the front of the building.) We had arrived around noon, so we were early for check-in. The front desk clerk was very polite and accommodating. He said our room wasn\u2019t ready but would do his best to get us in a room quickly; the lobby was full of people just hanging out so there was nowhere to stand let alone sit. We only needed to wait about 20 minutes. The first problem we had was the shuttle. We booked through Expedia and on their site they had that this location offered free shuttles to and from the park. What needs to be noted is that this shuttle leaves once and returns only once-no back and forth throughout the day. The shuttle to Universal leaves at 9:05 am, the park opens at 8am so you automatically loose an hour. The returning shuttle pick up is at 7:15, the park closes at 10 so there you lose over 2.5 hours! If this was posted anywhere on this site or theirs we would have changed before we arrived, this was an essential part of our trip since we had no rental car. At this point we had already missed it and would need a cab to take us to the park- $40 from this location (we did use one, as you\u2019ll read.) If you pay $80 a day to get back and forth using a cab you should just pay to stay at a nicer hotel that has around the clock shuttles. We were given our room cards and told we had the room right around the corner in front of the pool. The first thing that hit us as we opened the door was the smell; it smelled as if the man (who said he just cleaned up the room when we were in the lobby) had sprayed an entire can of Lysol. I could hardly breathe, and soon found why they had to spray. The entire ceiling is dotted with mold. The bathroom I can understand, and a little mold in a humid climate I can understand, but this was a lot. And while walking across the room I found the carpet was wet and squishy by the bathroom. I don\u2019t understand how the previous reviewers are ok with this? I don\u2019t want to stay in a room (even a very cheap one) that I will be breathing in this all night. And the reviews that say it\u2019s a very clean hotel?! There was trash by the lobby door, wrappers by our room door and our room would not be described as clean (maybe the false sense of clean by the strong antiseptic smell?!) We even witnessed a woman doing what is best described as bathing her child in the pool right in front of our door (washcloth and all.) Another problem was the lack of security; we had a large window across the front that faced to pool, while we were in the room people were walking by just looking in. We closed the curtains but the condition of the door lock didn\u2019t offer us any comfort. We quickly debated if it were worth asking for a different room opposed to moving hotels and agreed that if this is the room the clerk referred to us as \u201ca great room with beautiful pool views,\u201d we wouldn\u2019t be happy with any. We quickly arranged for another place closer to the parks (this one was at least a half hour drive away) and returned to the lobby.

It's great to sleep in, have a shower and a simple breakfast (cereals, milk, apple/ orange juice and some pastries), not more than that. So for me and my wife it was great value for money as we did just that. It's true that the rooms aren't very spacious but the bed was huge and very comfy, we heard no noises during the night and to avoid the odd smell, just close the bathroom door! The pool is small but you have so much to do and see that you will barely use it! The staff is excellent, providing you informations and services on everything you can think of. So overall I recommend this to couples, young and old alike, and to families with 1-2 children, it's an amazing value. Regarding the shuttles there is usually one at 7:30 am to the Disney World Main Transportation Center and another one at 12:30am. Return times differ depending from where are you returning but usually are between 7pm and 10pm. As for Universal Studios the shuttles leave a litlle bit later at 9am and 2pm and returns are more or less the same as for Disney. There are also shuttles to Sea World. If you prefer to get a taxi, you should pay 20-25 usd to go to either Disney or Universal. More than that and you are being ripped off. If you rent a car, dont forget that you need to pay parking in any of the parks- 14 usd on Disney and 15 usd on Universal Studios. If you want to go to do some shopping and find many restaurants, then International Drive is a good place not very far that would cost you 10usd to get there (depending on where you want to start)- My suggestions are Boston Read Lobster with their amazing and delicious seafood buffet and Orland Premium Outlets for great bargains on premium brands. Very nice places to have dinner and fun are Downtown Disney and Universal's City Wwalk with nice themed restaurants, but these are a little bit more distant than International Drive and usually making a reservation in advance is better. Try the Hard Rock Cafe in the City Walk and the T-Rex or Rainforest Caf\u00e9 in Downtown Disney... abslolutely flawless. As a final information let me tell you that a taxi to the international airport of Orlando (MCO- Sanford) mustn't cost you more than 60 usd.

The rooms look very old but not the furnitures actually. The bed spreads and towels are worn out and may have big holes on them. The carpet was the worst to me because it felt so dusty even though they vacuumed regularly. In a hotel like this, the people make the difference. The first morning -after a very long flight- we were late for breakfast. The lady who is in charge didn't even mind bringing all the food and stuff back from the kitchen, just for us! And the continental breakfast was much better compared to ones I had before. It contained Bagels, Danish, bread, jelly, Peanut butter, cream cheese and butter. There was always good coffee available in the breakfast / reception area of the hotel. I enjoyed going there in the evenings to have coffee while watching the news on the big screen.

The shuttle company Metro, which they have contract with, is not a very good one. We tried only once and took a cab the next days.

I called and they sent someone immediately to the room and immediately called me back. They kept them for me and I picked them up.
