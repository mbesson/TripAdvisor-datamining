Kay ran the property and was one of the best things about it. She wanted you to come back again and again. It was a place where you felt like family. My husband and I stayed there recently and were disappointed. The property was not maintained as well. The grass had overgrown the walkways to the cabins. There was no round the clock management on property. There seemed to be projects that had been started but remained unfinished: painting exterior walls and building some sort of deck. A few of the beach umbrellas were broken. The rocking chair outside our room came unglued and broke apart when used. We were charged a high rate even though it was evident the inn was far from fully booked. The doorknob on our cottage failed and we were trapped in our room twice.

The bathroom is roomy and the kitchen has all that you will need. You can open the two nice sized windows to let in the fresh air and sounds of the ocean. Outside each cottage are two rocking chairs where you can sit and enjoy the view. There are also two lounge chairs outside each cottage where you can lie in the sun while sipping a tropical drink. If you don\u2019t feel like eating out, you can cook in the kitchen or go outside and cook one of the propane grilles. The pool and patio area is large and well kept with plenty of lounge chairs and tables where you can enjoy the pool and the view of the ocean.

Although not oceanfront we only had a short walk out the door and down to the beach. We only used the pool once but it was very clean and never crowed during our entire stay. Parking is somewhat limited but upon returning every night from eating we always found a spot or two.

I loved it. I was happy to get a suite - 2 bedrooms each with a bath room and a kitchen/living room for less than many hotels right on the beach charge for one room. The rooms were modest, but clean and in good condition. The teens took the room with the twin bed and a full sized bed. They liked having their own bathroom, There was a small TV on the dresser. Our bed room had a queen size bed - but no TV. (the second TV was in the kitchen/living room) That was a disappointment to my husband, but once we each purchased a good book, we enjoyed reading in bed and didn't miss the television too much. The kitchen had just enough dishes and cookware to allow me to cook many meals in our suite. I was also told that you can ask the front desk for some extra things. For me, It was just enough to cook and serve everything I needed to. There also is a gas barbecue available for guests to use. I can't emphisize enough that the rooms and the grounds were clean. The staff was wonderful. A small continental breakfast was set out in the lobby every morning starting at 8am( fruit, donuts, coffee, hot chocolate and tea). There is a laundry room on site. Bring your own detergent and quarters. (the office can give you change) There is also a shuffelboard court and a heated pool. There was no housekeeping on the Sunday we were there - a note was posted on the office door the evening before. (the note also stated that clean towels were available from the office). On a positive note , they were updating several rooms while we were there, installing new carpet etc. This hotel is not for you if you want room service, like big hotels or like to be around crowds. It's not for you if you fell like you have to have a hotel attendant available. The office closes at 6pm daily and opens at 8am so you can't contact them then. My teens enjoyed their stay very much they indicated that they would have preferred a larger hotel with a lobby, a restaurant and other places to explore. I liked it very much and highly recommend if you like to get away from the crowds and if have simple needs. The hotel quest and staff were all friendly. It's a quiet place to stay will most like love this hotel is you like the \"road less traveled\".", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, ON", "Title": "\u201cI wish this was my backyard!\u201d", "Author": "JJH_10", "ReviewID": "UR59466649", "Content": "Great place for a family vacation.

Our housekeeper was Melinda and she took very good care of us. All the staff were very friendly. Coffee, tea, fresh fruit and donuts are in the lobby every morning at 8:00.

But their website had good info and the prices were great so we decided to give it a try and I am very happy with our decision. We stayed there from August 19th-Aug 23rd. We didn't stay a whole week b/c we were staying with family the rest of our vacation. Once it came time to check out we didn't want to leave! When we first arrived around 5 pm the lady behind the desk (if she reads this , i am sorry but i can't remember your name) gave us a warm welcome and she was very friendly. We checked in and she gave us our room key. When i originally booked our room i booked a garden view (which garden view is basically the grass and some pretty flowers) one bedroom suite which was the same price as the cottage. When you first walk in there is a small living room with a couch, TV, and the kitchen area all in one room. THen you walk into the bedroom which has a full bed and a twin bed and the bathroom is off the bedroom. We went into our room to check it out and it was nice. For the price that we paid per night it was a great deal. But I started thinking that i wanted to look at the cottage b/c it has a queen bed. We have a queen bed at home so i don't know what i was thinking booking a room with only a full size bed. (who wants to downsize on vacation) =) So we went to the front desk and asked the lady if there were any cottages open for the time that we would be staying there and she said there was one open. She gave us the key so we could go look at it before we made a final decision but told me that its cute and that girls ususally like it better. So we went to the garden view cottage and as soon as we opened the door I loved it (my husband liked it better as well) So we went back and told her that we wanted to change to the cottage. And she made some quick changes to our paperwork and then we went back to the cottage to unload our stuff. When we walked into the cottage it is just one big room with the bed right in the middle. The bathroom was off to the left and a full kitchen was off to the right. It was perfect for us. Everything was VERY clean and that is important to us. The only complaint I have was that there was a small lizard in our room the first night and then also the next morning (but i guess we could expect that being in florida) Luckily I had some bug spray so i sprayed it along the bottom of the door and around the floor a bit and we had no more visitors after that. Our first morning there we went to check out the continental breakfast. It is located in the office. They had coffee and tea and also different flavors that you could use. They also had doughnuts and fruit. Not a huge selection but the fruit was good and the coffee with caramel flavoring was great. The view of the beach was so beautiful!! And the pool was awsome!! A lot of people said that we were crazy for going to florida in August but in my opinion it was the perfect week to be there b/c of kids going back to school. We pretty much had the pool to ourselves every day. The pool area was clean as well. There was plenty of chairs to lounge in the sun. And outside the pool area there was a picnic type area with tables and more chairs. Overall we were very happy with our stay at Shoreline and we would stay there again in the future. If you are looking for a 5 star high class hotel then this might not be the place for you.

My Mother and I walked the beach for hours and, as far as we could tell, this is the only place on Daytona Beach where you can rent a cottage to yourself. The inn is divided into two parts, individual cabins and duplexes with one shared wall. The kitchenettes were fully stocked with dishes and relatively new appliances. There was also a breakfast nook, a separate bedroom and bathroom in our lodging. They deliver the local paper to your door every morning. We would walk into the office and pick up some Florida oranges (there's no matching the taste of the local fruit) and bananas and head down to the deck to read the paper in peace. It was lovely. The deck looks out directly onto Daytona Beach and is always in the sun (as is the pool) because the inn, possessing only one level, doesn't tower over the lawn in the same way its neighbours do. That's another thing-there is a large grass-covered lawn surrounding the place, an asset found nowhere else on the beach except in front of private homes. We enjoyed the fact that we had so much space and could swim and sun ourselves whenever we desired. I too enjoyed the proximity of the inn to the \"Top of Daytona\" restaurant, a glassed-in eatery on the 29th floor of a condominium building. The Top of Daytona offers good food, 360 degree views of the waterfront and early bird pricing before 6:00pm. The parking is slightly puzzling. You leave your vehicle outside of the building (whereas the residents park inside) and enter through a door (you can't miss it) inside the parking garage, where an elevator will take you directly to the top floor. I would also recommend the shrimp at the little diner on the pier nearby the hotel. As for attractions, we enjoyed ourselves at the mini-golf place across the street from the Shoreline. We also took in the Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse and Museum and the trails in behind the lighthouse, which I believe were linked to a science centre. The nearby lighthouse restaurant was full of character and offered all sorts of local seafood.
