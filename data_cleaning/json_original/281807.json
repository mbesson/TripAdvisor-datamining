I paid 108 euros per night for a single including breakfast. Some colleagues at the conference I was attending stayed at the three-star hotels recommended by the organisers and paid almost as much as I did but their accommodation was decrepit. I don't know of any other four-star hotel in Rome that costs less than 150 euros at the standard rate. The Hotel Villa Morgagni is well connected as it is a one-minute walk from the Policlinico (hospital) station on Line B of the subway (Metropolitana or Metro) only two stops from Roma Termini, four stops from the Colosseum. Though not a prime tourist location (you can't just walk out of the front door and throw your small change into the Fontana di Trevi, as you can at the Hotel Fontana) I would recommend it as it is still central. The rooms and bathrooms have all been renovated to a very high standard and breakfast is up on the rooftop terrace, served by very helpful staff. Also they had unlimited internet access on the computer in the hotel lobby, that was very convenient. For the metro you can buy a one-day card for 4 euros, a three-day card for 11 euros, or a seven-day card for 16 euros. Be careful as there is another hotel in Rome called the Hotel Morgana that appears from the reviews to be totally decrepit. This one is Villa Morgagni (pronounced: mor-GAN-yee). Villa Morgagni has some political history attached to it as it used to be the home of Antonio Gramsci, but clearly there are a lot of buildings in Rome that have been home to political leaders. It was a very nice place to stay and I would definitely stay there again.

The booking process: we booked through an online agency and after receiving our confirmation number I made contact with the hotel straight away to confirm all was in order. I had barely time to check the rest of my emails before I received a reply from Federica at the hotel who gave me piece of mind that indeed we were booked in for the dates requested. On arrival the check in was straight forward and copies of our passport were taken and the key to our room handed over - all in all 5 minutes. The rooms were small, granted - but in my opinion, perfectly formed and the only thing I really care about is cleanliness and I couldn't fault it, it was spotless. If you want a bigger room pay the additional fee and upgrade but in my opinion if you spend hours in a hotel room in Rome, you're doing something wrong - how much room do you need to sleep?! The air conditioning system was excellent, the bed spacious and comfortable, there were extra pillows if required and above all the area was quiet. I had 7 great nights of sleep. Breakfast is exactly as I'd thought and I thoroughly enjoyed it and looked forward to it every morning. The setting was ideal, on the roof, open air and relaxing. There's loads of choice and Catia was there most mornings with a smile to greet you. After that, we left the room behind for the day and explored Rome. We asked Alessandra and Federica for tips on where to eat and because it was a Sunday Alessandra called ahead and checked that the restaurant was open. The restaurants recommended were very good and so if you're looking to eat out then either Stella Maris or Gran Sasso are both good choices. The staff at the hotel are helpful, pleasant and efficient and if you have experienced anything different then it may be worth bearing in mind that attitude begets attitude - if you're not pleasant, you won't get it back! All in all the stay at the hotel was an important part of our enjoyment of the Roma experience and they didn't disappoint. Thank you! Now for some useful tips: I did my research before we left for Rome and so I knew exactly where the hotel was located and checked google earth so that I would recognise the street and the hotel on arrival. When you get off the plane at Fiumincino Airport (FCO) there are plenty of signs for finding buses and trains into Rome. Be aware! We landed late evening when most of the ticket offices had closed and so we made our way to the one that was open so we could get a ticket for the Leonardo Express train. The man at the desk did everything possible to try and persuade us that the shuttle bus was the best option - even saying it would get us there quicker and that the trains were only every hour. We stuck to our guns and went for the train at which point he actually became quite hostile, telling us we were fools and that he knew better, blah blah. We boarded the train less than 10 minutes later (they are in fact every half an hour) and were at Termini Station in a squidge over 30 minutes. Follow the signs for the Metro, it is a bit of a trek but there are mechanical walkways for most of it so if you're tired, just stand still! At Termini Metro look for Linea B to Rebibbia and the hotel is located a stone's from Policlinico Station - 2 stops from Termini. We bought a weekly ticket that cost 16 euro and covered Metro, bus and tram - excellent value for money. The transport system makes it a doddle to get around. Don't be put off this hotel because you think it is out of town - its perfectly located.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cThey Overbook!\u201d", "Author": "a l", "ReviewID": "UR117495545", "Content": "Beware....we arrived to find they had already given our room away at 3 in the afternoon!

The breakfast was typical European - but there were a few hot items as well - the breakfast room is quiet and elegant, simple with about the nicest staff around (will make you a specialty coffee, just ask). I was looking for reasonably affordable and I feel like I got a lot for the reasonable price - for me quiet location, clean, and helpful staff are key decision points within my modest price range and this place had it all. I would say the only con (if it is a con) is that the hotel as others have said is not in the center of Rome - but the bus really does stop out in front and the metro really is only a block or so away - also the pictures on the website excatly matched the real place - that was a relief! We were lucky enough to get a room with a balcony and it is about 2 times the size of the room! The room was small - but who cares - you are in Rome! The hotel staff was really great - a really nice touch after a long day of walking and sightseeing. This place really was an oasis in a nice residential neighborhood. It was no problem to take the metro every day to get to the sights. One non-hotel related tip - do not take the metro from the main train station to your hotel if your bags are heavy (we had only a few, but heavy bags) - the metro in Rome has almost no elevators and you will likely have to lug your bags up some serious stairs - and there about a zillion people to navagate through - pay for a taxi from the main Termini station - your back will thank you.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "zurich", "Title": "\u201ccould be better!\u201d", "Author": "luzurich", "ReviewID": "UR112836005", "Content": "I went with my parents and husband, the first part of the trip was ok, the rooms where clean and the staff where not that unfriendly.

While some Americans think this comes straight out of Gammy and Gampy's house, all I can say is that they should be so lucky! With polished mahogany floors, marble baths with large Jacuzzi tub-showers, large windows to a balcony (view to nowhere in particular)...we were more than satisfied.

That was the equivilent to a Michelin star. Bravo! While we were there, I left my iPhone (with my life history in it...there's a lesson there) in a taxi. I discovered it only moments after the cab dropped us off at the hotel. I think my gasp got the attention of the concierge/receptionist who went into full-court press to help me out.

Oh, did I forget to mention that we tipped him well for the trip he had just given us? Bingo!

Perfect place to enjoy a bottle of wine and some snacks that we brought with us, and the hotel even arranged for some take out chicken nuggets for the kids. While it is off the beaten path a bit, it's a very easy and quick metro or bus ride into the action. Even my 78 year old father thought it was easy! The best part of the hotel was the service. Everyone was so helpful and kind and truly made our brief stay all the more enjoyable. In fact, when they heard we were ripped off by taxi drivers charging us more than double for the ride from the train station, they arranged for a shuttle to the airport at a significant discount. We were given complimentary bottles of water for the ride, and even offered free cappucinos.

The room itself was clean, spacious, and the bed was quite comfortable. There was a number of balconies that don't provide much of a view, but are very nice for enjoying the weather and sipping on cappucino.

Be aware that the bus network is the most extensive in terms of public transport, the metro network is not as developed as in other main European cities (e.g. London, Paris) - there are only two lines. These two function perfectly though and metro's arrive very frequently. Two minor disadvantages: it seems that when you take a shower at a busy hour (i.e. multiple guests use the showers in their rooms at the same time) the shower gets cold every couple of minutes. I found this a bit annoying. Also the door doesn't have an easy lock very to lock it from the inside, you have to really check which way you turn the little handle underneath the door handle. If you turn it the wrong way it actually opens the door instead of closing it - I found the door to our room wide open in the middle of the night because I had turned it the wrong way and didn't check it.

The breakfast (served between 7.00 and 10.30) here is fantastic, we were really pleasantly surprised by the variety offered to us. There is also a turkish bath in the underground, but you have to pay for it. A small disadvantage is the fact that the nearest metro station (Policlinico) is served by the Line B and you'll have to change at Termini to Line A to get to almost all tourist attractions (except the Colosseum which on the track of Line B). This will cost you some time and energy and you will not want to be very often in the Termini station because it smells badly and you're risking to get pickpocketed.

The hotel is set back from the street, so you don't hear any noise from nearby traffic and it located very close to a metro stop. This metro stop makes getting to the major sites within the city easy as pie - reviewers who have claimed that this hotel is located 'in the middle of nowhere' must either have wanted rooms above the Spanish Steps (in which case they should expect noise and high prices) or they were, frankly, a little reticent to travel beyond the end of the street. Our room, while not massive, was spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated. The bathroom was also well-equipped and clean. I note a previous reviewer's gripe about the beds; we thought they were extremely comfortable, though they are on the firm side. Given that there is air con in all rooms, the issue of needing a blanket seems little moot - the room temp was always good for us, because we set it ourselves! Breakfast on the roof terrace was a continental affair, which was plentiful, tasty and relaxing - nothing stellar, for sure, but a nice way to start the day and as good as I have had elsewhere in Roman hotels. The staff were also very helpful, recommending restaurants and routes around the city...the Siciliando restaurant they recommended was a particularly good choice, being a non-touristic place to enjoy real Sicilian-style cooking on a beautiful roof terrace, which was perfect in the summer.

The aircon worked great, and the curtains allowed us to let in as much or as little light as we liked. Size-wise, it was typical for Europe, which would be a little small for America. But in our case the size was just right. In the bathroom there was a US/Japan compatable outlet for electricity. And a towel rack which kept the towels warm. The breakfast was superb, everything was fresh and great quality. We were in Italy and Switzerland for two weeks, and this was the best breakfast we had. Tthe other places were good, this was just even better. I loved the muselix with fresh fruit and fresh juices, my wife loved the cheeses and fresh salamis, hams, and proscuitto. The croissants were perfect..there's plain, marmelade, and other flavors baked into the center. The skin was perfectly crisp without being dry. For the rest of our honeymoon we never found croissants as good as these, but here we could enjoy them every morning. =) Lots of fresh fruit too. We found out you can order cappucinnos, just ask the lady who works there. Breakfast was actually the best point about this hotel. The location was good, just a minute from the metro (Policlinico station). This station is 2 stops from Termini, and easily accesses all main attractions. So getting to the hotel by taxi was just 5-10 minutes. The area around the hotel was a good neighborhood, and there's a convenience store across the street. If you want a taxi, ask the front desk and it'll be there in just 3-4 minutes. You can wait in the lobby and they'll come get you - this is a nice service about Italy and Switzerland. Taxis are generally prompt and polite. Compared to other hotels in Rome, I felt the price was reasonable considering the location and breakfast.

We arrived early lunch time and although our room was not ready we used this time to book some trips. Alessandra the Receptionist could not be more helpful and within 5 mins we had booked a trip to the Vatican with Green Line Tours and a walking tour with Enjoy Italy. This was quite a relief as we didn't want to be wandering round the streets of Rome looking for the sites or missing them completly. This was probably the best thing we did as Green Line picked us up from the hotel and the guide had us in and out of the Vatican by noon. Please, please whatever you do don't try and queue up with the masses to see the Sistine Chapel, pay the extra and go with a tour. Once we exited the Vatican Museum there must have been AT LEAST a 2 hour wait to get in if you were doing it yourself. We had the top room, room 401 and although small, everything was spotless and everything matched and well looked after. The benefit of this room was it had an enormous terrace, probably larger than the room itself, this was adjacent to the terraced kitchen area which you didn't notice as it was screened off. The terrace was lovely and the afternoon it didn't rain we managed to sunbathe. The bed was very comfy and we thought larger than a kingsize, we had clean towels everyday of our stay, the bath was a delight as it had a jacuzzi which did create lots of bubbles. The room was air conditioned, but the area in which the hotel is situated is very quiet so you wouldn't hear any street noise. We thought the location suited us, it was very quiet, only 2 stops on the Metro from the main areas, so although you couldn't just walk out to restaurants the hotel recommended a family Trattoria down the road which we both agreed was the best food we had and probably half of the cost of the more commercial areas. So if you are not bothered by jumping on the Metro (buy one ticket for the whole time you are there) or the fact it is slightly out of the way, go to this hotel, away from the madding crowds.

I left a little unimpressed but found a newsagent's stall just across the road where I bought a card for only 1 euro (single fare for all journeys).

Our room was extremely tidy and a great size for 2 - with a very good sized marble bathroom and a safe/TV/ammenities. I had heard horror stories about hotels near the train station, so I was very happy to be a bit farther outside of town to enjoy nicer accomodations at a reasonable price. While there isn't much for tourists to do in the Policlinico area, I thought it was an ideal location for a hotel. The metro was barely a block away. I am surprised at some of the descriptions of the breakfast, because I was very impressed. Not only is it \"all you can eat \"- it's included in the price of the room and it included many different types of fruit, cheese, loads of cereals, delicious croissants, made to order espresso, and there were hot dishes, too. I've even included a photo! It really started the day off on a great note to enjoy a cappucino overlooking the city on the open air terrace. We really enjoyed the nearby Gran Sasso, upon the concierge's suggestion. Our first bucatini all'amatriciana , and we were hooked!

They were wonderful with this, when we arrived at the hotel we found our room ready for us. Also, the staff at the hotel were wonderful with advising us of places to visit, how to get there, where the night life is, etc. One man gave us detailed instructions as to where the night life is and what bus we needed to take to get there. Another lady gladly rang up a tour operator for us to find out where we could take the bus from and then told us how to get there. The only let down was breakfast as there wasn't much choice, however this really wasn't a big deal and the croissants were very nice!

A 4 euro day ticket will allow you to jump on and off the metro till midnight and tickets can be bought from machines at the station. However, the metro line B stops at 9PM so going to the center at night, you will need to use a taxi or bus. It might be an idea to get hold of a bus timetable and routes before a visit. We didn't try walking because Rome in July is HOT (36 C) ! Although our room didn't have a terrace, there is a small, terrace with 2 tables and parasol off the first floor which allowed us to sit out at night. The room is air conditioned but this switches off if you open a window. We found that after closing the window, it is worth switching the air conditioning off and then on again . The staff are very friendly and our lack of Italian wasn't a problem. Breakfast is good and if you ask they will make you as many cappuchinos as you like . Gran Sasso is the nearest restaurant to the hotel and is OK . However, if you turn left after leaving the hotel and walk about half a mile to Via Arezzo ( not sure about the spelling) and look left down the the street there is a little restaurant called Il Tunnel. It doesn't look grand but we had as nice a meal there as anywhere in Rome and very reasonably priced.
