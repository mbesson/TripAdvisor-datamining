{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good value hotel and well situated This was the second time we had stayed at the Hotel Wilmersdorf and I would certainly go back there again . It is a 2-star hotel but very clean and has all you need for a short trip. Once again we were able to get a room at a very good price indeed on the web. The staff is always friendly and ready to help. The hotel itself is situated very close to two U-Bahn stations but you can actually walk to the Ku\u9e93damm in 10 minutes and there are some good restaurants in the area too (Pariserstr).We were in a smaller room this time and unfortunately the loo-seat in our bathroom was broken. (The cleaning staff would have known this). Even so, for our couple of days stay it was fine and although cold outside, the radiatiors both in the bathroom and bedroom worked well.Whilst perfectly adequate, I seem to remember the breakfast (different rolls, bread, boiled eggs, ham, cheese, salami, cereals, jam honey, juices etc.) being a little more varied on our stay last year (perhaps with yoghurt and fruit available too) but I might be wrong: What I really do remember last year is the fantastic breakfast they laid on for us in the bar at 4:00 am when we had to get an early flight. This year we left at a more civilised time so we didn't need to ask!", "Date": "Nov 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR658612849", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Maximar"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d632333-r6156348-Hotel_Wilmersdorf_Berlin-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "632333", "Price": "$109"}}
