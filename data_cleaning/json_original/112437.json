The problem with this hotel is the dilapidated state of the building. The carpets are stained, a/c grills are filthy, lampshades dingy and crooked, paint chipped, etc. These things aren't necessarily deal-breakers by themselves, but overall they end up making you wonder about the cleanliness of the bedding, etc. I neglected to ask for a non-smoking room at check-in, as I've become complacent, assuming that all hotels these days are non-smoking throughout. The 3rd floor is a smoking floor, and the corridor REEKS of smoke, so avoid that floor is you mind. I switched to the 4th floor after my first night, and it's smoke-odor free. Both rooms I had have the same problems: VERY thin walls (you can hear which song your neighbor's clock radio is playing when his alarm goes off at 5am), and VERY, VERY loud plumbing! I mean, when someone else turns on the shower, or flushes their loo, the abrupt torrent of water noise will wake you from a dead sleep. This noise is so loud that it makes conversation difficult in the room, and requires you to turn up the TV! I'm seriously not a very picky person about hotel rooms (I'm a pilot, I stay in hundreds), but trust me, this is not a restful experience. Oh, and the thin walls? Well, this is an AIRPORT hotel, and you may mind airplane noise a bit more than I do! :) Other, more minor issues: the wifi was sometimes very slow, and the showers are quite weak, and if the hotel is in \"heating\" mode, rather than \"a/c\" mode, your only option to keep your room cool for the night will be to open your window (see above re: airport hotel)..

MasterPark didn't care that I had already paid for 7 days of parking, Only after I steadfastly refused to leave my car along the side of the restaurant (I might as well have put a sign on the car that said \"please vandalize me\") did the hotel agree to let me park the car in a roped off area behind the hotel. However that meant I had to drag my luggage around the hotel in a rainstorm to catch the shuttle. And of course I will have to do the same when I return. This is not valet parking! Sadly this is the third, and last, time this has happened with this hotel. The prior two times the manage apologized profusely and one time even gave us an entire parking package for free.

The comforter was, alas, the somewhat scratchy kind popular in most hotels. The shower area looked quite nice with actual tile and it was absolutely spotless, even in the corners.

Believe me, I have waited much, much longer for some other hotel shuttles. The hotel itself is clean, quiet and very comfortable, with all the necessary toiletries and electronic hook-ups that we all rely on these days. I travel alone most of the time so I really appreciate the fact that my requests (which I have made ahead of time with the hotel) for a room on an upper floor are always accommodated, unlike some other hotels near this airport that I have stayed with in the past where a few front desk clerks seemed incredibly put-out by my request. I also think that it is very reasonably priced. My flights always seem to arrive either very early or very late when the restaurant next door is closed, so I appreciate the little snack-for-purchase area that is located right next to the front counter. This past trip I again arrived very late and decided to take advantage of the restaurant,13 Coins, that is literally two parking lots away and is open 24 hours a day. It's a safe, short walk to good food. The staff has always been courteous and very efficient.

When I took my shower in the morning the water temperature did fluctuate a bit. Also, and this is unfortunately the reason I will probably not return, the hairdryer was painfully weak. Normally I can dry my hair in five minutes. It took me twenty minutes before my hair was finally dry! Also, the $10.00 self-parking rate, we felt, was a bit too high.

They don't have their own shuttle, you use one of the parking lot buses. There are four, I believe; A,B,C, and D. That's confusing, only one works. My room was large, but it had an irregular shape.

The evening we checked in I went to draw a bath, to find hair still inside the tub from the last guests. The tub took over 20 minutes to drain afterwards, and I had to stay in the bathroom to move the plug because it kept stopping the flow. The next morning in the shower the water temperature went from scalding hot to freezing cold in a matter of seconds throughout my entire shower - the shower would not stay at a constant temperature. That day, we couldn't get the heater to turn off in the room, so we went out and left the window open to cool it off. On our way out we talked to the front desk about the shower, their only response was, \"Wow. I've never heard of that happening.\" After dinner and a movie out, there were no parking spots left in the parking lot, or anywhere nearby for that matter. After circling for 15 minutes, the manager told my husband to park in a spot that was partially blocking the fire lane and so far into the driveway that we almost got hit twice as we were parking. When we got back to the room that evening, there was a large beetle laying on my pillow. We decided to sleep on the second bed in the room in case there were more critters. As I pulled the sheets back I saw a small pile of hair. The evening manager was curt and even arguing with valet staff in front of a lobby full of guests, he is the same one who told us the \"fire lane\" spot was safe to park for the night. In an effort to avoid a ticket, my husband had to go back down an hour later and move the car. I would have expected these types of things from a Motel 6 (although I have seen some very clean Motel 6s), but not from the Red Lion.

When I hadn't heard back from the manager after not 1, not 2 but 4 messages on her answering machine over the course of 3 days, I became appalled at their lack of not only customer service, but lack of listening to a customer complaint.

The outdoor pool has definitely seen better days and even in the middle of July, it was VERY cold. BUT, the jacuzzi hot tub was a nice relief from the cold pool. The shuttle was quick and a nice convenience to get to the airport (hence our whole reason of staying here). So, all in all, this would have gotten a better rating, however, in our mad rush to leave at 4 am to catch a 6 am flight, we had left behind our 2-year olds' favorite stuffed monkey. I called the hotel as soon as we landed and thankfully housekeeping found it. I was so happy that they found it since my son doesn't sleep well without him. Since then, however, it has been one incompetent desk worker after another. It has been 10 days since they said they would mail it and IT IS STILL THERE! We have spoken to five different people and every one of them can't seem to understand how to stamp, address and mail a package. Every time we call about it, there's a different issue. The first time, they didn't have our credit card information (obviously someone didn't write it down but then neglected to contact us to ask for it again), the second time they said they didn't have our address (how many times do we need to give it to them?) and this last time, well let's just say they don't know why it hasn't gone in the mail yet (and they had the wrong name written on it). We've given up on them ever sending it so we're having a friend drive to the hotel to pick it up and mail it to us. At this point, I'm afraid of them putting it in the mail, it may never get to us.

This is the first time we encountered miscommunication regarding when the number of days for parking actually begin. This hotel has \"packages\" 7-day & 10-day parking for a fee with 1-night stay. (Previous hotels actually had \"free parking\") We were leaving 10/14 @ 6AM for Puerto Vallarta, Mexico travelling thru SanFrancisco & returning on 10/21 @ 11:30pm. When we checked in on the 13th, we paid the upgrade fee for 7-days of parking, \"MasterPark\" employees parked the car. Unbeknownst to us, our 1st day began the 13th when we checked in because they parked the car that evening. We should have parked the car in the Hotel parking lot for that evening, then handed the keys over in the morning, 3:30am prior to taking the shuttle over. However, while waiting for the shuttle we spoke to another party staying at the hotel & evidently someone had left their luggage in the car overnight in the hotel parking lot & it was missing the next morning. So...do not leave your luggage in the parked car!!! Needless to say, our return flight was delayed; we arrived at 12:05am at Seatac & to the hotel approx. 12:40am. Technically we were in the 9th day, so they charged us $16.99!!!! for each day over the 7. In summary, beware of ParkNFly offers that are not actually initiated & run by the hotel, the hotel staff may not be trained adequately. Clarify the exact dates included for parking with the parking company or hotel & have it in writing & initialed by the staff. Never leave luggage in parked vehicle.
