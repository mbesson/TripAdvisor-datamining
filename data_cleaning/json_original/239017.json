The rooms were small, which was expected, though the physical reality was more claustrophobic in effect than anticipated, and I'm not claustrophobic. What I didn't expect was the dingy nature of the entire place, most prominently in the bathroom which had large spots of black mould around the shower. A further failing is that the walls barely dampened sounds. If someone was in the hall, anywhere in the hall, I could hear their entire conversation, the same with the rooms to either side of me. When we arrived the carpet in the hall was being ripped up, which it desperately needed. The next day new carpet had been put down. It did not look like new carpet, but despite appearing that it had been there for the past fifty years, along with everything else in the hotel to include the towels, it certainly had the chemical smell.

Our first night was comfortable and very good. The second night, when we booked into our second hotel, hotel trianon, i sadly cannot say the same. We walked into the lobby, which looked okay, so we were slightly pleased we werent staying in a dump. Also, we were practically across the street from the van gogh museum! But ohhhh were we in for a surprise! We got to our room, looked around, and noticed our sheets were nicely folded and made but upon closer examination were completely filthy, and stained. The carpet looked like it hadnt been vacuumed in months. Half the light switches didnt work, and their was a weird smell. Oh and it gets worse. We thought to ourselves, well hey, at least we have our own bathroom. When entering the bathroom we noticed the shower was stained with dirt and urine. No one had cleaned it in god knows how long. I wouldnt step foot in the shower if someone PAID me. It was the most disgusting thing i have ever seen. I decided to spongebathe in the sink during my stay. Our bed, we decided to put a fleece blanket over it and use coats and hoodies as covers. I walked around in the room with my shoes because it was just that dirty. And im not the cleanest person either but it was THAT bad. We didnt even bother with the breakfast after seeing the room LOL. Regardless, we spent most our time exploring the city and thank god for that! Upon checkout some guy also checking out said someone stole a macbook from the room. Everyone staying there was extremely unhappy by the looks of it. Seriously, spare yourself the aggravation and trouble. Dont ruin your trip by staying here. Spend the extra 30 euro to stay somewhere decent. I am honestly surprised we didnt find a dead body under our mattress. As for bed bugs, i have a few mysterious bites so thank god i didnt sleep under the blankets there. The guy who owns this place is obviously a crook and doesnt care about peoples well being.

We obliged and returned inside (we are all +30, married with kids etc not typical drunken louts).....this chap then returned with a power drill and another chap (again burst in no knocking) and continued to bolt the door shut. Now, the room had no air con and was filthy, stank of sewage and it was around 26 deg C on the saturday........the worst think was that this was our only fire exit if the main exit became blocked.

I strongly advice anyone who is thinking of staying there not to.It is near the museums, so may be tempting because of its locaction. I urge you not to be tempted. This place should be Shut down.It should be reported to the Dutch health and safety. The room I shared with my sister was disgusting. My sheets had stains on it. The bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. The room itself was filthy. The shower and toilet again were disgusting. Filthy floor and toilet. We complained to reception with no joy. \"All the rooms are the same\" Dont even think about getting into the lift because it does not work. Again filthy, very old and tiny. Fits two people and gets stuck between floors. The worst part though was the second night.

She has been to the doctor, who told her that it is the worst case she has ever seen. She has been put on steroids, antibiotics, and has been signed off from her work for the next two weeks.This is just not good enough.

Dont forget it is not cheap and cheerful. It cost \u00c2\u00a380 a night for the double??? More like single room. My sister has informed the Dutch tourist board, and they were shocked. As for the breakfast I tried it once, and didnt bother for the next 2 mornings. It was revolting. I really do not understand how the owner of this dump can live with themselves, I suppose they do not care as long as they are raking in the money. It is a well known problem.

The hotel is filthy and the rooms are tiny. When we asked to change our room we were told this wasn't possible so had to put up with the dirt. The carpets are ancient, filthy, and covered in food and detritus. There were two empty crisp packets on the stairs that stayed there the whole 3 days, and a cigarette end that stayed there for 2 days. The only people we saw cleaning were young guys who looked like students. We tested our cleaner by leaving hairs etc. in the bath, which were there the whole time we were there - the cleaners didn't even use the shower to swish around the bath. The very worst thing, however, was that my friend woke in the middle of the night to find her bed absolutely covered in bed bugs - literally hundreds of them. She had to move rooms in the middle of the night but we saw the sheets taken off the bed she had been using lying outside the room the next day - obviously the bugs can spread this way. We were told by a member of staff that the whole hotel is infested with bugs. I urge you not to stay here.

The men on reception were friendly and helpful, and we do not blame them as they are probably being paid a pittance.

At that point we had seen only the reception area, restaurant and toilets and were so far impressed by the cleanliness and decor; unfortunately this did not continue as we left the ground floor!! We had booked an en suite room which I would recommend as we did notice one bathroom along a corridor which seemed quite seperate from the rooms it was intended for. The room was small which we expected but although it was basically clean it was very dated. The bathroom had a toilet and shower but it was a big step up to get into the shower and I had to be assisted by my partner to climb out as I was afraid of slipping. The shower itself was awful. We were only looking for a place to sleep while we packed as much as we could in our two day trip but we would have liked a small amount of comfort. Compared with other places we stayed it was neither cheap nor cheerful! The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the room became too hot and stuffy during the night. We had paid for the inclusive breakfast...DON'T!! We went down just before 9:30, breakfast was supposedly served until 10; there were no members of staff around and although some of the food was still available it was evident that as soon as things ran out, that was it. They didn't even have anybody replenishing crockery! We had to use cups for juice as glasses had run out and a spoon to spread butter on our rolls as all cutlery had run out! Everybody in the room seemed to be in the same predicament so it was obvious they had set up breakfast first thing and left it! It was a disgrace.

I didn't understand this comment until I saw my room, located in a different building around the corner, a \"sister\" hotel they explained. They were not so friendly when I asked for a different room because mine was dingy and it didn't have a closet (the room was the size of a closet) and it didn't have anywhere to hang my coat.

Now, on to the hotel itself. The rooms are absolutely TINY! And with the bare painted walls, it is just like a prison cell. The bathroom is even funnier - just enough room for a toilet and a half size bath, with the sink squashed in at the end of your bed. Also, we experienced a lot of noise from the people in the room above so not much sleep. The breakfast room, on the other hand is very nice as it also serves as a restaurant in the evenings. Traditional European continental breakfast is served. Quite a lot of choice. I would say - if you are looking for a room on a budget and don't intend to spend much time at the hotel (like us!) then this place is fine.

When shown to my room, I opened the door, my immediate thought was \"Why has someone left that tatty little bed in this small corridor\", then I realised it was my room! Rooms were small smelly and had damp patches, they were furnished with very old carpets, curtains and furniture. The walls had not seen paint in many years and were very \"yellow\". I had requested a non smoking room, my room stunk of smoke. The bathroom was basically ok with plenty of hot water, but had a permanent stale urine smell. Also greeting me in my room was a dirty glass starting to go mouldy. The plumbing was very noisy , keeping me awake till 2/3a.m. , then I was woken up again around 5a.m. by roudy revellers returning from a night out. Breakfast was ok if you were there early, but if you went down after 8.30, all the good stuff (eggs,ham,cheese) was gone, and was not replenished by the staff. So twice I had to settle for bread and jam. Also some free services promised such as satellite tv and use of a safe were either pay extra or non existant. Overall shockingly poor.

(Another member of our party was even given the key to another guests room). The rooms had no Air Conditioning, no Tea and Coffee making facilities, and were so small you had to put your case infront of the bed and wardrobe so couldn't use the wardrobe easily, it was more like a corridor than a room. The bathroom was so minute that we had the sink in the bedroom with us which had the tap dripping constantly. Carpets were old, smelly and had remnants of the previous occupants hair in amongst other things. There was no bar open as advertised, the only bar was a mini fridge in the reception full of tinned Lager. Breakfast was just okay, but the reception staff during the day weren't very helpful and seemed irritated if asked for assistance with Airport transport. We ended up dragging our cases around the block to another hotel and asked them to arrange our transport back to the airport which was done in minutes, free of charge.

The staff were curt, unwelcoming and bad mannered, only the cleaners said hello each day. Infact we got this reaction wherever we went in Amsterdam, only a minority of Dutch people were friendly towards us. The town (red light district Central) was miles away on a tram, ensure you have a ticket or you will be publically humiliated by the inspectors. You buy them off the driver, oh and make sure you always look both ways when crossing the road. Don't leave valuables in your room either, they will give your room key to anybody. We were a mature party of eight adults, this hotel would be more suited as a HOSTEL for the Amsterdam under privilaged.

We booked a twin and a triple room and although the twin room was really small, it was clean and had everything we needed. We didn't spend that much time at the hotel as we were out and about all day so the lack of space really was not an issue. The triple room was a lot more roomy so would definitely recommend the triple if you are staying for more than a week or if you like to spend a lot of time in your hotel room. The Trianon offers cheap accomodation in a clean basic hotel within walking distance of all the attractions that Amsterdam has to offer. We didn't use the trams but there is a tram stop literally a few minutes away if you don't fancy walking everywhere.
