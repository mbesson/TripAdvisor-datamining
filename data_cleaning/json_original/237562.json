So when i booked the accommodation it was 210 EU a night so then it was 420 EU for the 2 nights. In general you can get this cheaper if you book in advance. THe hotel itself is pretty close of the amsterdam terminal which you can take from amsterdam airport and was about 20 mins. From the Amsterdam train terminal to the hotel, its about a 10-15 min walk which is alright. When you get to the hotel, theres a small desk as the reception and because we came early, our room wasn't available but was free to leave our luggage next to the wall and could see other people also left their luggages as well too. I paid for the accommodation as the online booking doesn't charge your credit card but only assume they would if you didn't check into the hotel. Because I was using a CC, they had to charge extra which was really annoying. We went out and came back to our room. We originally had 3 single beds but they asked if they could take the other bed and we said that was fine. They had put the 2 single beds put together and i don't think the room could of had a 3rd bed but anyway. The room itself was ok, a kettle wasn't included, and in the shower, there was a tube for the soap so don't expect them to provide any shower amenities. The beds were ok and we were next to the river side so could hear the resturants and so forth but wasn't an issue during our stay. For the breakfast, basically theres downstairs room which is where the reception is and there is a big table. The food supplied was just bread, boiled eggs, some meat slices to put on your bread with butter, nutella & strawberry jams. The location of the hotel is really good as it is in the central district and down the road from the infamous red light district. Across the bridge from the hotel, you can walk up and it would be chinatown.

Maybe with the plus points which will be much quicker to say...the location is superb, right on the edge of the red light district. That's where the plus points end. The guy on reception was very cold and unfriendly. Our room was right at the top up some narrow stairs (fine for us but could be awkward for elderly people)...the bigger problem for us than the stairs was the fact that the window in our room was hanging off when we tried to open it! It looked very dangerous and looked like it could've fallen onto myself or my boyfriend. We spoke to reception about it and were told somebody would look at it....if this even happened nothing was done about it. When the window was open, the room was filled with the smell of curry permanently due to the Indian restaurant in the hotel. Now I like curry, but it's not a smell you want to be always filling your nostrils, particularly when you have just woken up. There was a fan in the room which we figured we could use so as to keep the dangerous window closed and help keep the curry smell out, as it was August and very hot.... when we got close to it, it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a VERY long time and I wouldn't even turn it on in the end at the risk of getting showered by dust. When I got an even closer look, I saw a few insects sitting in the spokes of it?!?! I presumed they were dead, but when I woke up with bites on my arms I can't be too sure! I visited a chemist when I got home and was informed that they were mosquito bites. Yes, this hotel is cheap by Amsterdam standards (certainly not by International standards) and I know you get what you pay for. I've stayed in many cheap hotels and hostels around the world, and am more than happy with a basic room just for somewhere to sleep, but compared to other cheap places, this is appalling. The rooms are a decent size, the bed was comfortable enough, the bathroom was small but fine, but I don't expect to find insects in a filthy fan, bites all up my arms after staying, unhelpful staff and a dangerous window that could've seriously injured us.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in the heart of the action!\u201d", "Author": "DaveTheBear1967", "ReviewID": "UR117525210", "Content": "I always stay at the Vijaya whenever I visit Amsterdam - the reason?

The most important things for me are the private shower/toilet facilities and its closeness to all the action - and it's at a lower price than many of the more basic shared facility hotels and hostels! As with most all the hotels in Amsterdam, there are stairs! It can get a bit noisy if your room overlooks the canal and the room is booked over a weekend, say... but I always carry earplugs just in case!

Having arrived at our room, just above the reception, we were delighted with the canal view. this is a 5 bed-room with a bunk bed. (Room n\u00c2\u00ba8) Lots of free walking space. But... at 3 am, one of us was woken by busy bed bugs and one of us went down stairs to complain. The on call guy camy up and changes the sheets, arguing it might be mosquitos (yeah, right, had i not read the TA reviews...) then in the morning when we were leaving, the guy that checked us in asked if we had had any inconvenience during the night and would we like to change rooms. We said yes, and were assigned a new one on the spot (Room n\u00c2\u00ba9, one floor up - a 4 bed room on which was added a spare bed... meaning... almost no walking space, but much newer room). This room was ok, but no view, and in the morning we could hear the noise coming from the repairs being done on the Our Lord in The Attic chuch, which is exactly 2 doors down. (i think they share the same court yard or something. they were quite near our window). this room is in front of the stairs, but since there is a double door, you can hardly hear anything from the ppl passing by, only if they are really noisy.... on our 4th night we were to change to a 4 bed room, as one of our friends was leaving, but we could stay in this room for one more night. although, on the last night, we did have to move to the 4 bed room which was assigned to us. and this meant... going up another floor!!!

Never had to use a tram at all and explored all parts of the city. Hotel is in the always interesting red light district, but is completely safe and adequate. It's quite old and yes, there's a steep staircase but we anticipated all that for most budget motels across Europe. Our room was smoky - cigarette smoky - though it is advertised as nonsmoking. It overlooked the canal with a nice view though. The bedspread was disgusting and stained, so we asked for a new one which has slightly less stains on it. Bathroom looked like an afterthought - you could barely walk between the toilet and the wall to get to the sink & shower - and we're thin normal-sized people. Showerhead was rusty and old, needing replacement. We didn't want to touch it for fear of tetanus or worse, haha. Breakfast was basic but free. Though we researched it online, we didn't know about the policy of turning in your keys while out. This was the only hotel in the eight countries across Europe we visited that asked us to turn in our key while we were out for the day. When we tried to avoid it, having heard many horror stories of rooms getting robbed, the manager got all defensive and lectured us endlessly about how it was for OUR security. Well, the only way I feel secure is to hold onto my own hotel key. He also said it was so we wouldn't have to pay for it if we lost it. What are we, complete morons? It's all fine and good if they want to have a policy like this, I just think it should be announced upon booking. And we really didn't appreciate having this insecure manager waste a good bit of our time lecturing us and defending the security of his staff, etc. Not to mention he took a jab at us being Americans - by saying we're used to crime & not being able to trust anyone.

Found the hotel quite easily from Centraal Station. Tried to check in at 10:30am but was way too early so was told to come back in 2 hours. The hotel kept our bags for us while we went out. Left near to reception but didn't seem entirely secure so don't leave money or passports etc in. As you walk into the hotel their is a 'restaurant'/reception area. The hotel isn't dirty as such but it extremely worn and old in every single way and area. very run down and needs some paint and carpets. We stayed in a 5 bed room on the top floor. It was a long way up and the last flight of stairs was extremely steep and narrow. the room was beyond basic. Five single beds, a 'wardrobe' that was barely holding itself together, a tv strapped to the wall, and a wet room. Extremely heavy window opened out onto the rooftops, poor view! Never had breakfast. One of our group passed by breakfast one morning and said it basically consisted of eggs and ham and cheese etc. We instead eat out at the local Bulldog cafe which was a nice full English. Had fresh towels every day. The shower was poor and at times almost just dripped out and went hot and cold. They didn't seem to do much to clean up, one of our group dropped his chips on the floor and didn't realise he had done it as they were down the side of his bed...they were still there the day we left as was the rubbish we had accumulated and left inside and beside the bin during our stay. Maybe we could have been cleaner ourselves but you would expect things to be cleaned up. Hotel key was handed into reception when going out so that was a good thing and someone was always there no matter what time it was. The best thing about the hotel was the location. Extremely close to Centraal Station and based in the Red Light District. Across the canal from it all. Plenty of bars, shops, restaurants and late night takeaways are all on the doorstep. We mainly used the Bulldog Cafe which was the cheapest pint of lager we could find at 4 euros. Overall, the hotel was quite friendly and seemed quite safe but it definitely needs a lick of paint and some money spending on it. I wouldn't recommend it to couples wanting something decent but to a group of lads it was fine as it was a bed, it was cheap and it was in a superb location. However, if we did return then maybe we would look around at other alternatives.

The Hotel Vijaya is on one of the original canals cut in Amsterdam. It is a two-minute walk to the first major church built there in the 13th Century, the \"Old Church\" (Oude Kerk). Next to the Vijaya is a hidden church from the 17th century---something to do with the \"Restoration,\" which is I think when the authorities allowed Catholics to openly worship again...I'm a little hazy on the history. BUT-----the hidden church is called Our Lord in the Attic (Ons Lieve Heer op de Solder), known now as the MUSEUM AMSTELKRING. Go inside and up to the top floor and you will be amazed at what you see: a small church all the trappings-----ornate alter and pulpit, pipe organ, choir, rows of seating, baptistries, side chapels, confessionals, marble holy water fonts, statuary, and views over the City of Amsterdam. One block to the west of the Vijaya on OZ Voorgburgwal is Warmoe Straat, one of the oldest streets in Amsterdam. A couple of blocks to the east is Nieuwemarkt and the Waag, formerly part of the city's fortifications. The street signs around Nieuwemarkt are in Dutch and Chinese---this is Amsterdam's \"Chinatown.\" There is a beautiful temple midway down Zeedijk south of Nieuwemarkt. About a ten minute walk from the hotel is the Spui, where Spuistraat, Nieuwezijds Voorbuurgwal and Singel converge. The area surrounding The Spui dates from the 17th Century. The hotel itself is \"tainted ornate.\" It has the original staircase with a beautifully carved handrail and steep stairs. In the lobby and breakfast room are large gold-framed ceiling plaques. But I describe the hotel as \"tainted ornate\" because the handrail is chipped or scratched in spots although it is very sturdy; the ceiling designs look a bit faded from age. Inside the bedrooms, the tainted ornate look persists. The bedding and window treatments are dark plaids, the wall frescoes are faded, and the windows seem to be the original very heavy affairs that are hard to open. The good part is that they CAN be opened to let in some fresh air. Rooms are small. Two of us got a triple room so we could have some extra space. There were one or two chairs of the outdoor patio seating variety that you see used for outside seating at cafes and restaurants. There was no writing table, only a couple of nightstands, one of which served as the TV stand. There was an armoir for our clothes and no drawers. I stayed on other occasions in a single room which was very narrow. However, there was always enough hot water for a shower and the TV worked. One down side is that you must remember to close the door properly as they don't close automatically. Don't just walk out the room and let the door close or it will stay unlocked. Many Amsterdam hotels are a combination of several houses linked internally by hallways and stairways. The Hotel Vijaya follows suit; getting to your room can be an adventure and it can seem like you are going through a maze to reach your room. It's fun! If your room faces the canal, you'll hear late night noise from the Trinity Tavern. If you're on vacation, don't worry about it. Join the fun, have a few pints yourself, and relax--you'll sleep fine. If you're awakened by a band of drunken revelers singing in the area, don't worry about it. Enjoy it for a moment then go back to sleep. If you're NOT on vacation however, get a room that doesn't face the canal. Go to the Oude Kerk to hear a free concert on Sundays. Catch the tram to the Concertgebouw for a free lunchtime concert on Wednesdays. Walk to the station and catch a train for a day trip to Den Haag, Leeuwarden, Nijmegen, Delft, Utrecht, Amersfoort or De Hoge Veluwe, to name a few. If you're driving, the whole country is at your disposal. Find some windmills or castles, or motor through the tulip and flower region. The station is only a five-minute walk. Dam Square is five minutes away. Stop in at Wynand Fockink, in an alley next to the Krasnapolsky) to taste some genever. There are other proeflokaals in the neighborhood. I staed at the Vijaya in 2008 and 2009. In 2009 their wifi was working and I must say it was much faster than my cable connection at home in San Francisco. I don't go to Amsterdam to surf the web but having wifi available is a valuable resource for getting travel information and making plans for your day. I heard something about buying tickets online for the Rijksmuseum----buy your entry ticket online and you will avoid the long queues outside the museum. I appreciated that breakfast was included in the room price. The breakfast was adequate and it helps get you off to a good start on your day. There are plenty of opportunities to get snacks in the area. There's a Febo automat across the canal from the hotel, and behind Dam Square is a Albert Heijn supermarket. On one of the alleys between Damrak and Nieuwendijk there is a \"vishandel\" (fish shop) at Zoutsteeg 6, where you can get fried fish, smoked fish, raw herring (\"Nieuew Haring\") and other seafood along with bread and a beverage. Beverages cost extra. The best thing about this hotel is its central location. There's limited car traffic on the street below and the main noise is from humans, not vehicle engines. Additionally, you're minutes away from seeing sexy women, practically naked, as you walk down the street. They are legal sex providers and many of them are really hot. If you feel uncomfortable seeing them just look the other way. ;-)", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cBest location for RLD/coffee shops & great spot for intercity travelling\u201d", "Author": "fleeginfloggin", "ReviewID": "UR51292130", "Content": "I don't understand some of the other feedbacks.

Me and my boyfriend got the room for two nights (Sat&Sun) for 190 Euros which included breckfast and there would be a room change half way through but both rooms had bathrooms inside, but we didnt mind. Also we rememberd to ask if it was a private room as we made the mistake of accepting a shared room earlier that day and quickly getting a refund. The first room had a big bed, a lot of space, a nice size bath room with towels, a wardrobe & cabnets, a tv with programs in English and wide windows letting the sunlight in. The second room was down a long corridor and was smaller but cosy too. The only thing I didnt like about that room was the bathroom, as the toilet was too close facing the wall so it was a bit of a squeeze getting your leggs round! Dont let that put you off though as it was a cosy room, the windows were pull out so we could stick our heads out to see the view of the streets. There was an ash tray in the room so it was easy to smoke without making the room smell!

They let you leave your bags there arfter you have checked out and the rooms are cleaned daily, the view over the canal is a bonus and it is not noisy concidering where it is.

But... when you expect the worse and receive something decent, your impressions become positive. So are mine about Vijaya. If you book the cheapest hotel in the middle of Red Light District, don't think it will be some schick, luxurious and romantic place. It is not. It's a place for small companies, where you keep your things, wash and change clothes, spend nights and take quick naps. Don't come with kids or for romantic trip (err, depends on your girlfriend of course, but I'd never book anything in this district for myself if going on romance:)) Location: 5-10 minutes to the Central Station, 5-7 minutes to the Dam square, 5 min. to Nieumarkt square. Pretty far from Vondelpark and Museumsplein. Sleep: you'll be able to fall asleep only after 3 a.m., as before that time nearly all crowd willing to see the ----- is crossing the bridge just under your window. From 3 a.m till maybe 10-11 a.m. your sleep will be rarely interrupted by the noise. The canal view from the window (we had a triple room on the 2nd floor) is spectacular. To sit in your own place watching the crowd but not being the part of it is really fun. And (that's important for smokers) - you can smoke in the room whatever your like. The rooms are more than simple, if you ever lived in a 2-star in India - looks like it (besides, Vijaya is owned or managed by people from India, so the likeness is obvious). The shower is a hole in the floor separated from the toilet by some plastic curtain, but even when 3 of us took shower in the morning, the water never flew over the level (as we once had in a two-star in Italy, where after taking a shower you had to swim in the bathroom to use the toilet:)) The towels are changed every day. Bedsheets - on request (in our case it was a note with the tip:)) The mouse: yes, there is a mouse. What do you expect from the 17th century building? It goes out only at night, first scared me to hell as I thought I was hallucinating:)) Regard it as a pet and don't leave food on the table - it will leave your room as soon as there's nothing it can consume. Security: one of the best you can imagine in such a district, though you can't say so from the first glance. To enter the place first you should use the doorbell, then a man at the reception asks your room number and surname and if you by any chance want to invite friends (in our case we needed to take in 6 people), you have to talk to the staff, explain why and how many people are coming and when they are going to leave. We kept our tickets and pretty much money in the safe at the reception (Don't know if there was a safe at all, but they returned the whole thing without troubles:). And everything was OK with our belongings in the room, they never even tried to take euro coins as tip, though we deliberately left it on the beds. Restaurant and breakfast: oops, never had a chance to try it as we were never up before 10:00. There's much places they serve English breakfast in the neighbourhood. So I think that's it. Absolutely OK for that money. Before booking this place, think of the purpose of your trip.
