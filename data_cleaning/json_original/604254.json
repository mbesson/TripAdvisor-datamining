All our hotels were fabulous, but I would have to say this was our favorite and the best: Great sleep, great location for both safety, restaurants, and metro/train connections. Hotelier Bruno greeted us--he was kind, friendly, helpful, professional, and made us feel very welcomed and not a burden at all. We used Rick Steve\u2019s Italy book for much of our trip. Although all the hotels he recommends seemed booked, one in particular--Hotel Sonya was the most unfriendly place we ventured into. The man at the desk did not say one word--literally not even a hello. He glared at me and let me get through my asking if he had a room for 5 nights and just shook his head and glared. I wonder how much they paid Rick to be advertised in his book? Obviously it was not for hospitality, friendliness, or otherwise, for those qualities were definitely not their main concern. In the end, we were quite glad they were booked as we found Hotel Centro. Many guests at Hotel Centro were Rick Steves\u2019 followers as well. We all wondered why Hotel Centro was not in his book??? It was all our favorite place to stay and agreed that is was a good find. I really cannot say enough about the hotel: Rooms were large, our king bed was 2 twins, but we never noticed. Our bathroom was the largest we had at any stay--I could put all my toiletries on the counter!!! The breakfast, which comes with the room, was excellent: a nice assortment of meats, cheeses, hard rolls, sweet rolls, juices, coffee, hot chocolate, steamed milk, water, milk, cereal [including an especially delicious unsweetened oat, nuts, and raisin granola], yogurt, and fruit--fresh, as well as canned prunes and fruit cocktail [maybe I missed some items???]--superb!!! The gentleman that prepared breakfast worked hard at replenishing food, cleaning up the tables for the next guests, and washing up the dishes. Then there were the two very friendly Hoteliers: Francesco and Bruno: Each was kind and friendly, and eager to help and make recommendations. We were five minutes from the metro and Termini Train station. My husband had wondered how much it might cost to get a taxi to the train station from Hotel Centro. Bruno suggested we just walk as it was only a couple of blocks away [it was probably less than a five minute walk and we only had a backpack on wheels and a small backpack on our backs]. When my husband went to the desk at another time, Francesco was searching for the best and least expensive ride to the airport for us--he actually had a really good price via taxi if we needed it; but, we had one day left on our Euro rail pass and we had to decline. I was impressed that they didn\u2019t wait for us to ask, they acted upon what they perceived as our needs and out of kindness and just doing a great job all around. It is what they do! Great service. Our room was always clean and done efficiently. One morning we went to breakfast and when we returned it was completely cleaned and ready for us. I seriously cannot say enough good about Hotel Centro, Bruno, Francesco, and the gentleman that prepared our breakfast {I wish I would have asked his name as well as he worked so hard} were fabulous.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cave Creek, AZ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location and Good Value\u201d", "Author": "shysue", "ReviewID": "UR119492945", "Content": "We stayed here for four nights in Sept 2011 and found it to be all that we needed and more.

Must be common in Rome though, because we stayed at another hotel in the area when we got back from our cruise and the bed was identical. A little like laying on a large slab of clay with sheets, it felt odd. Just my perception of it, maybe. It was a back room (away from the street) so it was quiet. And the hotel is in a safe area. We never felt unsafe while walking the streets at night in this neighborhood. The breakfast they offered was quite sufficient to get us started in the morning - wonderful coffee (from a machine, but very good), sweet rolls, not-so-sweet rolls, cheeses, deli meats (salami and mortadella?), cereal, yogurt, fruit. Buffet style so self-serve, but there was also an attendant offering cappuccino or espresso from a very nice machine in the back which only he was allowed to operate. He never asked us (don't know why), but we saw him offering cappuccino and espresso to others in the dining room. The real upsides to this small hotel were the price and the location. So central to so many sites, and about a 5 minute walk to a metro station (Repubblica) and maybe 10-15 minute walk to the main Termini station. Via Nazionale is 1/2 a block away with restaurants, banks, shops, etc. This hotel was at least 50 Euro less than other hotels in the area, and with the breakfast included it was a great value.

We had a double room which luckily for us was the one with the balcony right over the front doors so we had a nice view down the street. The rooms are admittedly smaller than you would get in say a travel lodge or similar, however, there was a standard size double bed, a wardrobe, a minifridge, a safe, a chair and a bedside table each with room to walk right around 3 sides of the bed so we didnt find the size any kind of problem and from what I've heard it is common for rooms in Rome to be slightly smaller than england so i think this hotel was pretty standard in that sense. The rooms were completely clean along with the bathroom which had a really nice good sized shower, and bedding and towels were changed for us everyday which mantained the clean and fresh feel of the room. The best thing we found was that there is a very good air conditioning system in the rooms which was a great relief to come back to after hours in the hot July sun, it was easy to alter the temperature a few degrees either way and so we slept very comfortably at night. Breakfast was actually a pleasant surpirse, neither of us are picky or had particularly high expectations but there was a coffee machine, fruit juice and water cereal such as muslei and cornflakes, pastries, bread rolls along with all sorts of butter and jam, fruit, ham and cheese amongst other things, so we found plenty to eat.

As others have commented, the breakfast was not particularly appetizing though it was adequate to get a start on the day. As for the offered \"taxi\" service to the airport, it is actually an independent company that the hotel makes arrangements with. The clerk offered to arrange a ride to the airport for us for 60 Euro which we were to pay directly to the hotel. Fortunately, I was aware that by law a certified Rome taxi can only charge 40 Euro for a trip to the airport, and when I mentioned this, he quickly lowered the price to 45 Euro (which I felt was ok for the convenience). But I'm sure many other guests have ended up paying the unnecessary extra fee.

However, after two days of walking we started to use public transportation a lot :) The location of this hotel is perfect. I would not change it to any other. Hotel is located within 10 mins walk from Termini Station, 5 mins walk from Piazza Republica (subway station), 2 mins walk from Via Nazionale bus stop... TIP: Buy \"ROMA PASS\" (25 Euro). Roma Pass will let you use city transportation for three days for Free, + it comes with Free tickets for two attractions (museums or archeological sites), + discounted other attractions, + YOU WILL SKIP THE LINES OF THOUSANDS TOURISTS at the entrances. I was so happy we got ROMA PASS. Back to the Hotel :) We stayed in Room 314 (a balcony is right above the flags/entrance). I liked the room. If you have a chance to choose, ask for this room. I would do that next time. - Receptionist Francesco is a nice and intelligent man. He will become your friend after the very first talk :) - A maid-girl does a great job here! One day we came back to our room for a short break from walking, but our room wasn't cleaned yet. We've said to a maid that she doesn't have to clean our room today. She said Okay... but a minute later knocked and asked if she can empty trash cans and change our towels :) A very sweet girl! - Breakfast was good. Some reviews say about bad breakfast. I cannot imagine what these people expect to have. It is 3-star hotel, and I've expected worse than i got. I was really surprised by breakfast. A coffee machine makes Cappuccino better than in Starbucks. We had juices, bread, ham, cheese, yogurts, serials/milk, fruits, five types of croissants, jam, butter, etc. - Room was large enough for two, a shower cabin was large and clean. - No English channels on TV... MTV and Fashion channels were more than enough for watching before bed time. - Hotel is located on a small street with no traffic. So it was quite during night time. One night, however, our neighbors with three kids were singing some Italian songs around 10-11PM... Unfortunately, you cannot pick your neighbors :) - Safe Box in a room was good to have - We have taken a few drinks from a fridge/bar (kinda expensive) but again- good to have an option - A balcony was a great addition to the room. TIP: when you go to a balcony, push-down a hanger/opener on an inside door, play with it to understand how it works. Otherwise, you may end-up locked on a balcony :) It has happened to me :) I had to scream from the third floor in my \"not-perfect\" Italian, asking pedestrians to call a receptionist :) - The supermarket is around the corner (3 mins walk) - Via Nazionale is the best street for shopping in Central Roma (pricewise / quality wise). We have found better cloths on via Nazionale than in Roma outlet mall (closest to Rome). TIP: Do not go to the mall (Castel Romano Designer Outlet Mall). It is a waste of time. Shop on Nazionale and Del Tritone (\"Barberini\" next subway stop from \"Republica\"/Nazionale) - Francesco had offered a \"taxi\"-friend for taking us to an airport. Certainly, it was more expensive than Leonardo Express from Termini (10 Euro more). But 6AM walk to Termini and a ride with all the luggage in a rain... So a \"morning pick-up\" from hotel was another thing we didn't regret we ordered from this hotel. TIP: Talk to Francesco about a pick-up reservation a few days in advance - NO COMPLAINS AT ALL! IT WAS A PLEASANT STAY. WOULD COME BACK! TIP: Lower your expectations, relax, and enjoy the city! PS. We had a bad experience at the next door restaurant Trattoria. Just pass it by.

I only noticed it during the day and again, it added to the charm. (Note. it did not bother me to the point of being concerned about it waking our baby). + The staff. Were helpful when we asked, otherwise \"hello\" and a smile were all we saw of them. - The lift. Only one tiny little lift. A couple of flights of stairs are not a problem for us generally, but we were traveling with a baby in a pram. It just meant waiting on occasion (especially at check in or check out time). - TV. From memory I don't think there was anything remotely interesting for kids. The only English channels were news. Not a problem for us - we had a portable DVD player for the 4 year old! - The breakfast on offer was a little bit sad. If you're after a full continental like you'd find in 5 star chains, you won't find it here. We did manage to find enough coffee, pastries, cereal and some bread, meat and cheeses to get us on the way every day. So overall, okay. Final note: try to book the room on the top floor at the front of the hotel. More expensive but the large private terrace is worth it. I think this must be one of the hotels high points as the photos are on it's website.

Only a few blocks from the main train/metro station. (Termini) And a block up from the Piazza Republica. We hardly used the metro at all as most things are in walking distance. And Rome is a place where you're going to do a lot of walking. The breakfasts were basic. Coffee/tea, juices, pastries, cereals, hard boiled eggs, breads, salami and meats, yogurt, fruit. Tip: as the attendant to make you a cappuccino. It is so much better than from the little coffee machine. We were there for a whole week and didn't have any complaints about the room or the hotel.

Only good points was the location. It felt safe even at night, was as close as you would want to be to a train station and in walking distance to a few of the sites. On other word of warning though, if the guy at the hotel desk suggests a particular restuarant to go to - DON\"T. He must just be drumming up business for a friend or family member as the food was horrible, service just as bad and wasn't very cheap at all.

It is close to the Coloseum and many other sites and churches of major importance. Our room was always cleaned well. The room we had this time was the same room we had in March--with a terrace--and a bathtub/shower combination. The room was large enough and had a t.v. and minibar. For us, the most important thing about this hotel is the fact that everyone will go out of their way to help you whenever asked. Giovanni, Michael Bruno, Francesco and all the others have become like family to us. I think the rates are well in line with the rest of the city, especially since they are so helpful! It is not a super plush hotel, so don't expect extreme elegance and satin sheets, but it is comfortable and clean and very pleasant with a staff that is wonderful.

The shower was tiny and you had to be a very small person to fit into it without bumping the flimsy screen. The breakfasts were quite good for a European hotel, but the room was underneath the hotel and felt like a bunker! The one man who attended to the room insisted on smoking in the kitchen (which wafted into the dining room) and we saw cigarette ash all over the floor on one morning. It was meant to be no smoking. The lift was very very slow, and there was only one. To get to the lift involved a set of stairs, so not good for disabled people or people like us who were lugging heavy cases. The hotel \"arranged\" for a private car to take us to the airport, he said it was better than a taxi. In hindsight, we felt we were probably paying his mate to take us, the driver wouldn't carry or help with our bags to the car and he spoke no english.
