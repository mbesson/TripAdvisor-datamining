The staff are belligerent and disrespectful. The management is just as bad. I even spoke to the area manager to no avail so I had no choice but to go to the corporate level. The maids only clean rooms once a week and when they do they either half-@ss it, lie about cleaning the room when they didn't (this happened to us multiple times), or otherwise come up with some excuse to get out of it. They say they're pet friendly, but they're really not. We have a cat and have been consistently refused maid service until we essentially clean the room ourselves beforehand. Having even a grain of litter or pellet of food on the floor is grounds for refusal as anything involving the pet isn't the maid's responsibility to clean according to their rules. The rates are outrageous for the poor service and lack of amenities. The laundry room isn't functional most of the time. Their wi-fi is anything but high speed. The only plus is it's in a great location, but it also happens to be a crime ridden one. Not only was our car broken into during our stay here, but we've seen the police here more times than we could count.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cI am going to report this establishment to their Corporate office\u201d", "Author": "Kelly M", "ReviewID": "UR116567328", "Content": "I have traveled for 25 years all over the U.S. and this is by far the worst hotel ('extended stay' experience I have ever had.

I asked who would refund me and they told me to call the owners of the machines and report that they were out of service and to collect my refund from them. The owners of the machines stated that they were not responsible for refunds, but they would come out to service the machines later this week.

However, when the new manager took over some months ago, things started to become overlooked. We stayed this last time and to be honest with you, was taken back by the filth that was evident both in the rooms and around the grounds. In our particular room on this stay, the carpet was worn out and had become detached from the tiled kitchen area. Each time my children walked across there barefooted, they walked across carpet tacks. The bathtub had \"unspeakable\" hair in it. There is spots of mildew and mold growing in the bathroom. The air conditioning wreaks in this room of urine/smoke. We have learned over the past 2 years to take a can of Febreze or you will not be able to tolerate the smell. The beds are like sleeping on the floor --probably would be better off on the floor. The carpet is simply put -- DIRTY. The grounds of the hotel needs a scrubbing and someone to pick up cigarette butts, etc. The staff needs a lesson in customer service as they have and will continue to be less than \"polite\" at this location. The manager and I have been in screaming matches before over her attitude. I simply will not stay in this motel again, even though it is convenient in location and excellent in price. 2 years ago, I had a different opinion, and it's truly a shame.

There are some problems but the Homestead has been without a handyman for a few months. Things did slip a little but they have one now and things are getting repaired.
