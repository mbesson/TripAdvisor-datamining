The first time, my son found a bed bug and we were not charged for the stay. The manager apologized profusely and assured us they would get it dealt with and I am sure they did. Wanting to give it a second shot, we made the mistake of staying here again and bringing a car. My son found a used condom under the bed and had to be moved from his room, which was decent enough of the hotel. Beds were OK, rooms OK, TV didn't work in my room and the creamer was actually hard.I have never seen creamer so old that it is hard. The internal fire doors all seemed to be 'sticky'. We stayed on a Friday night and the music noise from the downstairs was really quite bad until very late ( I went to bed at 1.30pm and it was going then ). I am used to loud music and was on the 5th floor , but even I couldn't sleep. The thing that made me most upset though was the following. When we booked in we had to hand the keys to our vehicle over to the desk (they had moved the car 'to make way for other vehicles' in the short space of time it was parked there)Despite the cameras all round the car park and the surveillance screens on the front desk, no one saw a thief breaking into the vehicle and the cameras were not hooked up to video! Not very useful.The cameras gave us a false sense of security, as they turned out to be completely pointless. This all happened in the space of less than 2 hours of being parked there in broad daylight. So my advice is, if you have to stay in downtown Vancouver stay somewhere else.If you have to stay here, do not expect any sort of protection for your vehicle. In fact, if you ask the hotel staff, after the event, they will show you in writing that the vehicles in the car park are not protected by them, even though they have hold of your keys. Yes it is near to everything, yes its reasonably priced, yes the rooms are cleanish and hopefully they dealt with the bug problem. Yes the staff are pleasant enough. BUT beware the drug users scouting out the cars in their car park.They are very swift about their business and the hotel staff did not seem unduly perturbed for us, leaving me to assume they have seen this scenario many times before! **Ramada, pay someone to either actually watch your cameras, video tape it, or employ a guard in the car park.

It was so awful on the first night that the thought of returning marred the whole holiday. Whilst the location maybe fairly central, the area immediately adjacent to the hotel was mostly occupied by seedy clubs and sex shops. Granville St was populated mostly by drug addicts, alcoholics and the homeless. As 2 middle aged female travellers, we were accosted numerous times by these unfortunates and were so concerned for our personal safety we felt obliged to hail a taxi for the very short distance back to the hotel. I speak as a resident of a big city with a poor reputation for crime but I have never been so scared to be on the street. The hotel itself stank. When we first checked in the corridors and our room smelt so strongly of floral disinfectant we thought the place had just been fumigated. We immediately left the hotel and returned only at bedtime. Sadly the floral smell had vanished and the only comparison I can make to the smell that remained was of raw sewage. The whole area of the hotel had this smell so there was little point in changing rooms. When we asked the front desk what the smell was we were told it was probaly paint as they were renovating!!! Next morning we waited patiently for the hotel restaurant (Morriseys?) to open for breakfast. We wished we hadn't. After walking into the restaurant and seeing what a dump it was, we walked straight out. On our second stay we were upgraded to a suite because of our complaint. The corridor to the room had that same horrible smell but fortunately most of the room was smell free. I thought the bed hadn't been changed after the previous occupants but the front desk assured me that wasn't the case but they don't iron their sheets. I have never stayed in a hotel that does not iron sheets. Enough said?

That's bad enough, but the way we were dealt with by the management was an absolute disgrace. The manager we spoke to didn't apologise, refused to offer a cent of compensation, and threatened to kick us out on the street. The full details of what happened are as follows: BACKGROUND Myself, my brother, and my father were in Vancouver for 3 nights at the end of May as part of a 2-and-a-half week city-hopping holiday following a family wedding in Las Vegas. We chose the Ramada because of its downtown location, and because it had rooms with 2 beds plus a sofa bed, meaning that all 3 of us could sleep in the same room, but in separate beds. Our experience in this hotel was the single bad experience we had over the course of what was otherwise an extremely enjoyable holiday. WHAT WENT WRONG Our room was booked and FULLY PRE-PAID several weeks before our stay. However, because we knew we were going to be arriving late (after midnight), I phoned ahead from Vegas early in the afternoon of the day we were due to check-in to let the hotel know our expected time of arrival. I was assured that it was not a problem; they confirmed that they had our reservation, that it was all paid for and that our room would be kept for us no matter what time we arrived. However when we arrived (about 1am), the desk staff spent some time looking at their computer and paper records, and eventually informed us that there had been a mistake, and that our room had been sold to someone else. What's more, they had no more rooms available for the first night of our stay (but they had a room for us for the second and third nights). Clearly, to sell a fully pre-paid room to someone else is a pretty huge mistake to make. HOW RAMADA DEALT WITH IT ON THE NIGHT While we waited a member of staff phoned around other downtown hotels, but was unable to find us a room in the area (it was a saturday night, and everywhere seemed to be full). They therefore had to book us into another Ramada (at Kingsway), a 20-25 minute cab ride away from the downtown area. Between arriving at the first Ramada and checking in at the second, a period of more than an hour had elapsed- an hour of lost sleep and frustration. We had to pay up front for the night at Ramada Kingsway (meaning at this point we had paid for the saturday night twice over), and for the cab fare. The Ramada Kingsway was not a particularly nice hotel, and the room we were given had 2 beds but no sofa bed. As I mentioned above, one of the reasons we booked the room in Ramada Granville was that it could sleep the three of us in separate beds. As such, the sleeping arrangements at Ramada Kingsway were not ideal. However, it was the best that could be done given the earlier mistake, and so we settled down to sleep. HOW RAMADA DEALT WITH IT THE NEXT DAY After getting to bed so late on Saturday night, we awoke late on the Sunday morning, with the hassle of moving our luggage back to Ramada Granville St and checking in still ahead of us (eating in to our limited time in Vancouver). We paid for a taxi back to the Ramada Granville St and went to check in. At the check-in desk a female member of the management team approached us, saying that she had heard about us. At this point we fully expected her to be apologetic, to offer us compensation for the inconvenience, and to go out her way to make the remainder of our stay a happy one. We couldn't have been more wrong. Her demeanour absolutely stunned us. Instead of being apologetic, her manner was confrontational and nothing that she said constituted an apology. She kept saying things like \"mistakes happen, but it's in the past, move on\". We did get reimbursed for the taxi fares and for the first night at Ramada Granville St, meaning that we had no longer paid for the saturday night twice over. However, no offer of compensation was forthcoming, and when I raised the issue her response was breathtaking. It was along the lines of \"What's the point, how's that going to help you? What's happened is in the past, and me giving you money isn't going to help with that\". Wow, so this hotel clearly thinks that if they make a monumental mistake and inconvenience their customers they don't need to apologise or provide recompense. At this point I was struggling to believe what I was hearing, but it was about to get worse. The next thing she did was essentially to threaten to kick us out onto the streets! She said that as we were clearly unhappy, she wasn't sure she wanted us staying in the hotel, and she would rather we stayed somewhere else. Again, we were utterly stunned. We felt backed into a corner, as we really didn't want to have to waste more time finding another hotel, and we knew it would be difficult to find somewhere to suit our sleeping arrangements. As such, we reluctantly backed down, and left the matter at that. We checked in, and over the next two days spent as little time in the hotel as possible.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "kj_318", "ReviewID": "UR113922226", "Content": "This hotel is quite frankly one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at due in part to the staff.

At this point, everyone sees it and screams. So we attempt to tackle the situation ourselves and tried to catch the thing. This didn't work because we could never find it again- my guess is it was living in the couch. I proceeded down to the front desk to inform them of the situation. They could not move us that night because there were no other rooms available like the one we were in, so we settled for a partially comped room price and free entrance to the bar next door. The next day, we had to pack up and move rooms.

I believed that I would not be charged until departure, or at least arrival) so ok, my fault I guess.

The front desk woman was extremely rude about this, lied and said that someone had contacted me and that was just an overall terrible experience. But ok, I guess stuff can go wrong sometimes. And then another friend who had booked a room in the same hotel arrived. \"Oh, the fire alarm went off and everything in the room that was reserved for you is soaked. You can't stay here.\" Seriously? Okay. The same front desk woman then proceeded to belittle them a bit, and then found them a room 2 MILES away, for more money. No apologies, no offering of a cab to get there, and a lie about the proximity of the new hotel. It's 8:30 at this point, we have things to do on GRANVILLE, where she had booked a room. And, when I suggested that they get a room at the Howard Johnson across the street where I am staying and know they still have rooms available, the woman behind the desk goes \"we already reserved this one for you. Sorry.\" My friends proceed to trek their way (in a foreign country no less) to the oh so close hotel. They arrive at the Empire Landmark and the gentleman at the front desk has not received the reservation because the evil desk woman at the Ramada has used Expedia and not faxed them, or called them to inform them of the situation. My friend proceeds to call the Ramada and try to figure something out (roaming charges applied) and she asks to speak to the front desk at the Empire. They speak for a bit, nothing is fixed. She refuses to fax anything over (confirmation) and when the phone is handed back to my friend, your front desk woman is on the line screaming profanities. \"He's a f***ing idiot, I'm going to come there and slap him\" Etc.

The rooms are always clean and the staff are extremely personable. They recently refreshed all of their rooms so although the building is heritage, it has a very modern feel to it. I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone who loves being in the middle of everything and wants a little something left over in their wallet for that great local designer find or a great meal at one of the hundreds of amazing restaurants the neighbourhood has to offer.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat affordable hotel right downtown that is pet friendly.\u201d", "Author": "Vansetter", "ReviewID": "UR98586669", "Content": "Close to everything - nightlife, transportation etc., pet friendly, reasonable pricing", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vernon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLOVE IT!!

We were told over the phone that for our dog it is $20 total plus having a credit card on file. We were happy with the $300 price and was budgeting our trip accordingly.

We explained that we had not been advised of this and how we had been told a certain price.

The people working at the front desk were very nice, and happy to help, although they didn't seem terribly knowledgeable; there were several people correcting each other when I asked for information on local busses, and they were unable to help another customer who asked about fishing tours. There were several downsides to the hotel, however. We requested a crib for our three-month-old and were brought a foldaway playpen (like a Pack'N'Play), which was fine, but we had to supply our own sheets for it. We had made some special requests (like paying extra to have a very late check-in) which were only sort of accommodated, but I still felt like the staff were doing their best to help us. I think they were hampered by being a bit understaffed at the front desk, and not having good communication between each other and with the management. The suite was fine, too, and we were very glad to have the dishes and the microwave. The TVs were quite nice, and the bathrooms were bright and nice. Cleanlines was fine, no major problems, but there were definitely hairs on the windowsill and in the tub when we arrived.
