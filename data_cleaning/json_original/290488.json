{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Too low-budget for us. This accommodation is not a hotel, but a flat where a family rents out rooms with a shared bathroom amongst their guests down the hall. By no stretch of the imagination is this anything above budget accommodations. The price is right: 50 Euros a night. The noise level, however, is pretty huge. Dumpsters, people yelling in the street, motorcycles...you'll need earplugs. But the really big problem is there's no air conditioning, and you pay an extra 3 Euros a night for a fan that doesn't really keep the room cool. We're lucky it was only in the high 80's (Fahrenheit) that week and not the 90's. The family is extremely welcoming and very kind. They will even make reservations for you at the Uffizi Gallery and the Accademia which saves you a lot of trouble doing it yourself. My husband and I agreed that we made a mistake not booking something a little better in Florence. Florence is really busy and a little grimy. You might want accommodations that take you out of that scene. You can find their contact info for booking in Rick Steve's Italy 2008 travel book.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR924658500", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FabulousTravels"}, {"Content": "Loved the Soggiorno Magliani I recently stayed at Soggiorno Magliani in Florence for two nights in early June. My room was very neat and clean if a little bare. The owners, a mother and daughter duo, were extremely helpful. They even allowed my to borrow two of their personal Rick Steves travel guides. Soggiorno Magliani is located within walking distance of the train station as well as many of the sights of the city.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR177560997", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Cute room, wear Bathroom thongs I liked the huge wardrobe and matching secretary. Room 2 has a sink and table for spreading out a snack. This room has double paned windows which is good, but looks down on an Internet place whose lights shine up under the shutters till late. Also, on both Friday and Saturday at 5 in the morning the garbage truck came by for the dumpsters which were right outside our window on the side street. I could feel the springs in my bed so I was not too comfortable. But, the little old ladies cleaning the room were so sweet. Rick Steve's 04 calls it being at your Italian Grandmother's. However, I found it hard to tell my Italian grandmother that the shower needed a good scrubbing.", "Date": "Jan 16, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR385511508", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "RubyDuo"}, {"Content": "Come a casa!
