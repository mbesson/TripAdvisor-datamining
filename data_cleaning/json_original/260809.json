The only thing good about the place is the Location, very close to Museums and the main tramp line Nos 5 which covers most of the key Amsterdam location is right outside the hotel. Its walking distance to shopping and multiple eating options of liedsplaine. Besides this I have nothing great to say about the place. The stairs are a climb for anyone and every age however fit you maybe, they are narrow and seems like a ladder has been put instead of the steps. If you plan to drink enough and come back, it better to climb it on all fours :) The breakfast which everyone raves about is purely basic and limited and extras are available depending on the mood of the server that day. We stayed for 3 nights and the 1st morning breakfast we had an elderly lady serving the breakfast who very rudely refuse to give us a 2nd round of paid orange also, stating she was too tied up with other guest...at any given time that room can only fit 4 tables, so i dnt understand her excuse...maybe she was having a bad morning, but that is no excuse to ruin the brakfast of paying guest...post that we never ate breakfast there even though it was included in our room rate...kinda demeaning for us. The rooms are very basic and ok on cleanliness. Certain rooms facing the tramp line can be noisy due the cars and tramp line starting early morning. If you are planning only crash and spen most of the day out then this may suit you...but then a little more research can get you far more for the price of 125 euro per night. Rest of the staff were fine, but for us the old hag totally spoilt it. We made our peace with the small rooms and tiny bathrooms. But what really got our goat was the not so friendly staff.

I would advise anyone who can to do the same. The location is very good - handy for trams, buses and many attractions. I didn't find the tram noise a problem but anyone who expects quiet might. I actually found I slept better than usual. The lady who greeted us had an interesting manner (we met a few different staff during our four-night stay and none of them bowled me over with friendliness). She did show us many points of interest on the map she gave us. Also we were pleasantly surprised to be able to check in as soon as we arrived at the hotel (we only intended to drop our bags, but she checked for us, and there was a room ready). We were among the lucky ones who had booked an ensuite. The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor, however, was like that of an ascetic old lady. And our window (room no.4) was quite small and right in the corner. Two single beds masquerading as a double, not impressed! It's one thing when, as I've seen, the beds are dressed as one, but not only were they dressed singly, my mattress kept migrating from the bed, leaving a chasm between us. The beds were, however, very comfortable and the quilts warm. And the room was clean. I didn't mind not having a TV, but I really missed tea and coffee-making facilities (tea and coffee are available for 1.50). The breakfast room, as noted by many other reviewers, is charming and light-filled. The (brown) bread is delicious with a crunchy seedy crust. I would advise anyone who doesn't like the white of their egg runny to ask for a hard-boiled egg! I found the one slice of ham and one of cheese and charges for extras a little mean. Despite it's location, the rates are not cheap enough, in my opinion, to add extra charges. On one morning- but one morning only - my boyfriend, who requested no egg, was given an extra slice of each. No fruit, cereal or yogurt.

It's based in the south-west of the city, just off from the Rijksmuseum and there's a tram station on the main road so a great location for travelling around. The hotel itself is one of the traditional Amsterdam buildings, so very tall! I'd read that the steps were steep, but getting in and seeing how steep still surprised me, something to be aware of if carrying a lot of luggage. The staff were friendly and helpful, when checking in, the lady gave me a map of the city and drew on points of interest like local markets and shopping areas. Again during breakfast, the staff were friendly and I had no problems. I had the single person room which was on the top floor. It was a nice room, with a huge window and a good view out, a very comfy bed, a desk and chair and a sink, towel and shelf in the corner. The room was nice and bright and very clean and even with the window open all night, had no problem sleeping - as there aren't many cars about, there's not much noise from outside. The toilet and showers are shared. On the top floor, they were just outside my room, but on the top floor, they were tiny. However, there was another shower and toilet on the middle floor which were a decent size, and again, very clean. Despite them being shared, I never had to wait to use the toilet or shower. The breakfast was good - boiled egg, cheese, ham breads, toasts and jams with juice, tea and coffee. Outside the dining area was also a notice board with lots of little bits of advice, places to eat, shops worth seeing, tram times, etc. Was useful and nice to get some pointers of where to go.

I was very enthusiastically greeted by the staff and given plenty of ideas of things to see. Then came the room: number 8. I booked a single room without a bathroom; I was expecting it to be tiny, and indeed it's one of the smallest I've stayed in. Truth be told though, it was the perfect size. The room had a huge window that opened to a huge balcony (bigger than the room!) and such a lovely view. The toilet was behind the door just adjacent to the room, and the sink in the room makes a big difference.

If you can't stand walking though, don't fear because the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum, and Cocertgebouw are visible from the hotel, and Leidseplein-which has every kind of food you could need as well as several nice bars and coffeeshops-is just a few blocks in the other direction from the museum. You can even catch a wonderful canal cruise not more than two blocks away. Lastly, if the value weren't good enough already, the free breakfast matched anything you'd get at a bed and breakfast type place. The breakfast room is lovely and overlooks the Rijksmuseum. The seating is open so the guests tend to actually talk to each other during breakfast instead of just keeping to themselves at their assigned tables like at many places. If you're at all considering a stay in Amsterdam, GO because it's a lovely and unique city that you must experience at least once, and you can't go wrong by staying at Museumzicht.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston upon Hull", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "Robby007", "ReviewID": "UR65821065", "Content": "Nice character, budget accommodation.

However it turned out to be very good value and certainly contributed to an excellent first impression of the city for me, and an enjoyable return for my boyfriend. Quite a long walk from the city centre, this gives some breathing space with Museumplein and the Vondelpark nearby. Many attractions and restaurants are within easy walking distance and as well as the trams and buses, canal boats depart from nearby Singelgracht. -The 120 year old building has huge character, especially those stairs. There are a total of 80 from the street to the top floor, and around 45 even to the lowest level. They are indeed very narrow so there's no chance to leave in a rush if you see your tram approaching out of the window! Not too much of a problem if you are relatively fit though. The stairs and hall are well decorated with posters and tips on things to see and do. -Our room was small but practical; twin beds (soft and comfortable) pushed together underneath the attic beams, two chairs, a coffee table, wardrobe and sink. No TV or phone, but if you have as busy holiday as we did, you won't need them! The hotel does offer wi-fi and if you don't bring a laptop, the staff will search things online for you, such as transport routes and the weather forecast. The room's sash window gave adequate ventilation in the mid 20s Celsius weather, but might provide a draught in winter. Noise from the tram stop outside might give you problems if you have trouble sleeping; I wore earplugs on the first night rather than shut the window. -A sign in reception warned about the risk of mice but I saw no evidence of them, even when I mistakenly left an apple on the floor while out for the day. The room and importantly, the toilet and shower, were both as clean as could be. The latter on the top floor are both small, but I had no problems with them. Make sure you give yourself a few extra minutes in the morning in case they are occupied when you want to use them. Other guests can also cause noise problems tramping up and down the stairs in the early hours, because you're given a front door key so you can come and go whenever you please. -Breakfast was good: unlimited bread or toast, with a boiled egg, cheese and ham, jams and other spreads, orange juice, and tea or coffee. Certainly enough for a busy day's sightseeing, and all organic/free range. It is not served before 8:30 however. The owner's Jack Russell likes to play ball in the mornings, but if you don't like dogs, she's easy to avoid. -One piece of important info: the hotel charges 5% on credit cards, TAKE CASH to pay for your room when you arrive.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201c2nd time's a European Charm :)\u201d", "Author": "MenBobbyMcGee", "ReviewID": "UR63408169", "Content": "This was my second time in a year visiting Amsterdam- this time with my Hubby & Dad visiting from the USA.

I emailed the hotel in advance for a quote, and when I got there I dropped by to take a look at the place. I like to see a place in person before committing to it for a lengthy period: in this case, I am glad I dropped by before reserving. The hotel is a lovely old building right next to the Rijksmuseum. While initially favorably impressed from the exterior, my actual experience with the hotel was not pleasant. I rang the bell and walked up a couple of flights of (steep) stairs to the reception area, where I was greeted by a hotel staff member. I explained that I was looking for a room for the next week, and asked to see one before committing. Her reception wasn't exactly welcoming, but it wasn't completely offputting, either... that changed soon after I climbed two more flights of stairs to look at a small single room, though. She handed me the key and sent me off to look at the room on my own. I spent a couple of seconds taking it in. I sat on the edge of the bed, trying to imagine whether or not I could subsist in a room the size of a broomcloset with the depressing aura of a flophouse for the next week. Almost immediatley, the staff person -- apparently concerned that I had spent too long in the room -- came bustling in, exuding an air of ill-concealed suspicion. She was obviously put out that I had sat on the corner of the bed and, after making an exaggerated show of straightening a small wrinkle in the bed covering, she ushered me out. What had started as a luke-warm reception turned downright chilly. In an attempt to lighten the mood, I tried to chat about the weather, the view... anything to establish a positive connection. In return, she accused me of taking advantage of her good will and wasting her time for my \"entertainment.\" If I weren't seriously considering staying there, I certainly could have found better things to do in Amsterdam than walking up four flights of stairs to spend 30 seconds in a depressingly spartan hotel room and be insulted for my interest. In short, I am incredibly glad that I did not make a reservation at the Museumzicht in advance without seeing the hotel and meeting the staff first! Completely aside from the attitude problems on the part of the staff, the room I saw was the very definition of sad -- claustrophobic and cheaply furnished with a bare minimum of disposable items. Bathroom facilities in the hallway bordered on unusable due to their liliputian dimensions. I suspect that doubles are probably much nicer and more livable, but I didn't dare ask to see one, based on the attitude of the staffperson. I certainly would not recommend a single room in this hotel without checking it out first so you know what you are getting into. (A few years ago, this sort of room could have been had for the equivalent of $30 or less per night. It is shocking that it can now command two or three times that, and that it comes with a heaping helping of contempt from the staff, as a bonus.) Ultimately, I wound up choosing a room in another part of town. For $15 a night more, it was furnished very comfortably, had about five times the space of the Museumzicht's single, and it featured a kitchen with stove and refrigerator, as well as private bath. It also came with something a lot more valuable: hospitable and welcoming proprietors, who made me feel like a valued guest, rather than like a pariah. In short, you can do a lot better than the Museumzicht for the price. In all fairness, maybe I caught the staff on a bad day or at an inconvenient time, but I have to say that in decades of traveling the world, from Africa to Europe and South America, I have rarely felt so unwelcome at a hotel. The staff person attempted to recover a bit as a left, saying that it was \"nothing personal\" that she had been so suspicous and accusatory... but I don't think anyone would call that a welcoming reception that would entice him/her to stay there.

Immediately inside the door, guests must climb to the 3rd floor reception, and most room are one or two floors above that, and all are very steep and narrow steps. The elderly or disabled would face great difficulty here. The breakfast is simple but good, and the breakfast room has greats views of the Rijksmuseum across the street. The double room had a sink but no bathroom, and is one the expensive side at 75 Euros, as it was very small as well and had no extras like TV, refrigerator, or air conditioning. Staff was friendly and helpful, but their 5% fee for credit cards is a little high as I believe that more than covers their costs for using credit card services. On the last night, other guests were young and clearly in Amsterdam for a party, and that would be fine if the staff had been willing to do something about their noise or the shared bathrooms that these young guests chose to trash. Good location for the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum, but a long walk from the central area.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "redway, california", "Title": "\u201clove this place!\u201d", "Author": "snickle", "ReviewID": "UR4052781", "Content": "I've stayed here a couple of times in the last five years and have a sentimental attachment to it.
