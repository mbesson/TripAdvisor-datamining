I felt if I had of wanted anything I could have approached the receptionist but there was nothing in addition I needed. I would recommend this hotel for backpackers, solo travellers and couples.

Staff was nice and helpful, if you're respectful too. The way I felt it, it's more like a family business. For the price of hostel room with 10+ beds, you can get a cozy room, with bathroom and shower. There might not be a \"social room\", fitness or a hotel bar, but that's not really why you came to London, is it? The room itself was not very big. But it was clean, with a little table where you could make a tea or coffee. There was a little bit of mold on the shower wall, but nothing too horrible. But let me tell you about the location! It doesn't get much better than this. You will be staying in the center of London. 10 minutes from Victoria station, 20 minutes from Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament or Buckingham palace. Or if you like long walks in park, 10 minutes from Hyde park. To sum up, it is superb place to stay, if you're in London to do some sightseeing and if you plan to leave early, come back late, get a shower and sleep comfortably.

After spending two nights in another city, I came back by myself and stayed at Westminster again. This time just for one night. I got a different room than before. What was really bad in this room was the mold in the bathroom (behind the sink, in the shower, on the shower head, and on the wall and ceiling). I was glad I was staying for only one night. I told the manager about the mold when I left. He said he didn't know about it and waits for the cleaning staff to inform him of any problems. In my opinion, I think the manager should occasionally check rooms to make sure everything is okay and not wait for the cleaning staff to tell him. Most of the maintenance work required would not take much money , just some time and routine cleaning.

As a couple, we booked a twin room but on arrival were told that they only had two single rooms, each with only a single bed and on separate floors.

This was at 11:30pm, as our flight was late, and it was quite obvious they knew we wouldn\\'t have much of an option at that hour. But, after seeing that the area had loads of hotels, we decided we preferred to share a room together, as you would, and left. But then we were charged for the night!!!!!!!!!!! The hotel didn\\'t provide the room I booked and then had the cheek to charge me anyway! Now, after disputing with hostelworld, they have lied and said they did provide it. Even without this disgusting experience,which obviously shows they care more about \u00c2\u00a354 than customers, I would warn you against the hotel. The two rooms we were given, #5 and #7, were tiny, which they admit to, but they don\\'t mention the mould, the smell and the dirty bed sheets do they? Yes, the location is awesome, but, lucky for us at midnight, there are loads of hotels on the same street. In fact we were taken in by a lovely South African guy at the Harcourt Hotel - well recommended. As for this hotel, it is a horrible looking place and the staff and owners have shown that they will rip anyone off given half a chance.
