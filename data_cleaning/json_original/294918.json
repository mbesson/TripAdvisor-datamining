Without realising it, I had been to this hotel 5 years ago. Good 4 star facilities, however the room was quite small but adequate for our use. Good touristic location for all sites to visit in walking distance. Unlike previous comments I did not think the breakfast was up to 4 star status. I found it quite limiting. For anyone wanting to use the pool for swimming this would have been impossible as it is only a 'plunge' pool. My only gripe was the day on leaving we were subjected to maintenance being done on the floor above - drilling going on for hours. A note was pushed through the door to say they would move us if we wanted to rest. This was a tad too late as although I had booked and paid for 3 nights, my flight status had changed and needed to leave 9pm that night, so really didnt want to pack and move room at this short notice. Knowing that I had a change of flight and being through the night I wanted to rest in the afternoon....but couldnt!!!", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "munich", "Title": "\u201cBreakfast with fantastic view\u201d", "Author": "keklenz", "ReviewID": "UR127909053", "Content": "We have booked this hotel directly quite upfront our journey to Istanbul and got a very competitive rate including 1 airport transfer and 1 spa access per person. Extremely convenient location close to all ancient sites and many restaurants (Grand Bazar, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Beyazit & Sulthanamet, Kumkapi fishing village - all in walking distance). Excellent and helpful staff, also before the actual stay. The offered family room was indeed 2 fully equipped double rooms with two bathrooms andconnecting doors. Very clean, well equipped with comfortable beds, coffee&tea making facilities and quiet at night. Side view to the sea. Classically furnished, not extremly modern and not a design hotel style but you feel immediately very comfortable in the room The breakfast room is located on the 6th floor and offers a fantastic panorama view which we enjoyed every morning. The breakfast buffet is at least 10 metres long and offers a huge variety of good food. Coffee is unfortunately - same as in almost all hotels now - from one of these machines where coffee does not really taste well. Another highlight - also if you travel with children like we did - is the indoor pool on the 7th floor. It is not large but sufficient and nice to visit after many hours of walk in the town. A bit strange that there is no dividing wall between the bar and the pool. We also enjoyed the small spa with sauna, jacuzzi and steam bath which was wonderful after a long cold day with rainy weather. Pool and small fitness room are free of charge, the spa does cost extra. Also on the 7th floor you have two sun terraces with even nicer view than in the breakfast room. We have not visited the hotel restaurants due to the huge variety of nice and affordable restaurants in the area. Guest are offered a welcome drink in the English pub on ground floor. Another reason why we chose this hotel is, that it is constructed in an earthquake-proof way. I would always recommend this hotel and would come back when we visit Istanbul next time. I have stayed at a different hotel some years ago which was very traditional, much more expensive but the beneftis of Best Western The President are so convincing that I do not want to try different places.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cStress Free and Fun with a few Quirks\u201d", "Author": "Ben728", "ReviewID": "UR127595982", "Content": "We were met at the airport by a man holding a sign with our name on it, who took us to a shuttle directly to the hotel (part of the package we booked). The hotel is in the Beyazit district, not far west from Sultanahmet, on a very steep and interesting street (the immediate neighborhood is populated by a mix of small leather merchants with all sorts of gods). Just south of the hotel is a large restaurant area with a big variety of choices. Just beyond that is the waterfront with, of course, even more restaurants. It's a fun location, and you can walk to all the major locations or get on the tram line, which has a big stop just up the street, where you can also find currency exchange (at better rates than the hotel) and all kinds of other shops and restaurants. Our room was good size and very clean. The hotel provides bottled water every day, as tap water may not be safe to drink (there are warning signs). The front desk staff is very friendly and seemed to speak decent English and French, although there were some struggles (we had to speak with the concierge to clear up a few items). The breakfast bar is very nicely set up on a high floor, where you have a great ocean front view of the beautiful sunrises. The top floor has a nice restaurant that we didn't have a chance to try, and a great outdoor bar. The pool is also located up there and it is very nice, although not exactly in a quiet area. There is a business center where you can log in and check e-mails, etc (the computers are old, but adequate). All the personnel were very courteous and accommodating and seemed to have a good sense of humor. On our last day there, I got locked out on one of the roof top decks for some reason, and had to come down the interior fire escape. I didn't realize that I had tripped the fire door alarm and was greeted by a breathless security guard with a walky talkie asking \"You OK, You're not burning??).

In the morning the buffet breakfast is reason enough to stay there with a vast selection of food for even the pickiest of eaters and a nice view overlooking the sea.

The view across the city overlooking the Sea of Marmara and the Blue Mosque is spectacular in the daytime and magical by night. The service from the staff was attentive, friendly and courteous at all times. It may be partly the exchange rate, but we found the hotel to be an excellent place to eat out in the evening. Istanbul is a fascinating historic city, but after the hustle and bustle of the day, we found it much easier to relax in the evening in the peace and tranquility of the hotel. Considering its proximity to the old city and major sights, the hotel is surprisingly peaceful. The fitness suite and pool are free of charge to use - the latter is just somewhere to splash around, but aren't most hotel swimming pools. There is a sauna and jacuzzi, but it does cost 10 euros a day to use.

It's a much bigger breakfast than you'd expect for European culture and was delicious and had varying hot food each morning. 3. Room - basic facilities and amenities, yet the room (and bed) were still very comfortable. Our stay was made that little bit more amazing by our fantastic sea views from room 521.

Their included breakfast was wonderful with European and Turkish foods. Loved their yogurt, cherries and honey for breakfast. Did not like their coffee at all!! Our room was typical European small rooms and we had an inside room, morning prayers only woke us up one time. The rooftop terrace with lovely sundeck was perfect to relax and watch the sunset with a cocktail after a day of sightseeing. We did use their rooftop pool to cool off several times. I did think their cocktails were overpriced but the view was outstanding of the Marmara Sea and the Blue Mosque. We did splurge one night with the family for their 2 for 1 dinner, the food was only ok but the views and ambience was amazing! I wanted to bring a bottle of wine to have with dinner and they said no even when I offered to pay a corkage fee. Desk staff were very nice and helpful especially Cansu who was so very helpful with directions. Included with our stay was free airport pick up and transportion to the hotel and they arranged transport back to the airport for 10 euros pp. They also had free computer use and we were able to print off our boarding passes. Our son used the gym and said it was good however I did want to use just the jazucci and they said there would be an extra charge so I said no thanks.

It is very conveniently located near many of the city's attractions, restaurants, transportation (Bazaar, Mosques, Tram, etc.) and has most of the services that a traveler expects. It also has a more than adequate breakfast, reasonably clean rooms (if you discount the ants that seemed to find their way into the room every day) and very helpful staff. A very special bonus is that guests who stay at the hotel for 3+ days will be picked up at the airport at no charge--a great way to begin a visit to Istanbul. Unfortunately, there was one very bad incident that marked our stay at the hotel. We took a taxi from the hotel back to the airport. Prior to this, we had asked three separate hotel staff members what the taxi fare would be and were reassured when all three persons gave us the same answer. While loading our baggage into the taxi we again asked the same question of both the taxi driver and the hotel's bellhop on the street. This time the answer was \"whatever is on the meter.\" Unfortunately, this cab's meter was on the floor of the taxi and out of sight of the passengers. The bill for the trip was fully 3X higher than that estimated by the hotel staff. As a consequence, I would recommend taking the crowded tram/metro to the airport or better, a hotel airport limo and not a cab from this hotel's line of taxis.

Everywhere we wanted to visit was within a few minutes walk and for our needs this hotel certainly seemed to be the best placed of any in Istanbul. We stayed four nights so the hotel offered a free pick upfrom the hotel, which worked very well. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary during our stay and were greeted on arrival by Tulay Akar of guest relations. On our anniversary we were given a basket of fruit, bottle of wine and and a hand written card from Tulay. All the staff were really friendly and helpful but we would like to single out Tulay in particular. Rooms were comfortable and clean. We had paid for a sea view room and ours was more than adequate, although some rooms are on the small size. Breakfast was in a large room on the 6th floor with panoramic views over the city. The buffet table ran the length of the room with a wide selection of things to choose from. Our one complaint is that the walls of the rooms are rather thin (a common problem with Istanbul hotels it would seem). On our first night our sleep was disrupted by a neighbour speaking on skype to his family for two hours at the top of his voice. The next night it was a different guest and we had to ask him to turn down the sound on his TV. Even allowing for thin walls it was extremely loud. The best was yet to come! A British guest who decided to hold a very long and loud telephone conversation at 2am. We complained to guest services and he finished his call only for the phone to ring 10 minutes later. We complained to guest services again who sent someone to his room. After a brief argument things went quiet and we finally got to sleep. I'm not sure whether this is a regular occurence or we were just very unlucky but Istanbul does seem to attract some very thoughtless hotel guests in our experience.

He was patient and very helpful in answering all our questions. As agreed we were met at the airport by the hotel arranged transportation (good sized and new van) and upon arrival to the hotel the check-in was quick and efficient. We were in Istanbul for only two days, and since the room we selected was not a suite, we had to arrange the furniture around a little so that all our luggage could fit and the kids had some room to move around. The check-in manager was kind enough to point out that we could leave our double stroller checked in at thier free luggage room which was heaven sent. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable, in addition to the 2 twin beds, they even arranged for an extra bed for our toddler. We had all the necessary amenities required for a stay. Breakfast on the 6th floor was amazing with lots of tasty varieties and the view of the Bosphorous was simply wonderful. Since we had a couple of wonderful and balmy sunny days, we were able to step out on the outdoor terrace (above the 6th floor, close to the pool) and take in the wonderful panoramic views. We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it was rather small but looked inviting! Same goes for the fitness and spa area. The hotel did a great job arranging our transportation to the airport too. Just a note to poeple thinking of exchanging money...although the hotel do not charge a commission, they do give you a lower currency exchange and when I questioned it they mentioned it was higher than other hotels. I would reccommend getting currency converted at locations conveniently located by the grand bazaar and if you think of doing it at the airport they charge commission there too. As other reviewers have mentioned,the hotel was very conveniently located to just about everything we needed. A note for other parents with infants and or strollers--this hotel is located on a steep incline and going up or down may be rather challenging--depending on your circumstance. Going up to the main street where just about everything was located was easy, and although Istanbul sidewalks are not expected to be the same as in North America, it was fairly easy to navigate with a stroller. Going down to the fish market and restaurants was another adventure all toghether but we were glad we did it. Just a note to anyone thinking of taking taxis up/down the hill. Because of where the hotel is located and the routes the taxis need to take, it may not be worthwhile in terms of time and money to take one.

It is very well situated for all the essential sights of Istanbul- the blue mosque, Topkapi and Aghia Sofia and so on in walkable distance. The roof top terrace is lovely but the pool is very small. The rooms are quite small but everything you need is there- ask for an iron, adaptor, tea and coffee facilities and they will get them for you at no cost. The staff all speak good english and are very helpful and advise you honestly. A word about Istanbul- it takes a day to get used to it. It has a very thin veneer- you are on a very nice street- turn a corner and its a ghetto. But that's the way it is - it is safe, people are very friendly, going about their business but are definitely out to make a fast buck out of you. Always carry plenty of small notes/ change with you.. Always haggle, look at the change you are given-challenge it if its wrong. If you get large notes from the ATM change them at the hotel or go to somewhere reputable like MacDonalds and buy something. Even the official employees at the tram station tried to give us a defunct note! When challenged he gave us the right one- remember they only have to do it with 4 or 5 people a day and they make \u00c2\u00a320. Overall we really enjoyed Istanbul- its a very different place, exciting, bustling and quite amusing. Coming back to a reputable hotel makes it all the better.The English bar is somewhat of an oddity- i've never been in anything like it and i've lived in England for 40 odd years; clearly a Turkish take; It is 20 years behind in a make over. I would definitely suggest a trip across the Bosphorous to the North side of the Golden Horn to the Beyogulo district. You can get the normal boat for 60p which is a lovely break or just walk over the Galata bridge. It is more modern there with good bars and nightlife. We tried the Asian side but that was pretty dire.... The sights to see are by the hotel in essence but in the evening head to Sultanahmet or Beyogulo.

A plaque at the top of the street was the only way we knew where it was as the taxi driver had no idea where the street was, this was not uncommon. The service was very good in reception and the rooms clean but a little tired, a good 3 star I would say, and the cost to go with it! The roof top terrace has a great view over the Bosphorus , and an excellent way to unwind and relax. The non-alcoholic drinks as well as the hard stuff is quite expensive, but worth it for the view. I was apprehensive before and glad we stayed afterwards. I was a little disappointed with the breakfast, a good choice of cold but only 3 warm dishes. However, staying at 4 other hotels during our trip it was retrospectively quite good! And the view from breakfast room being adjacent to the terrace was great in the morning. The Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar etc. etc. are all close, we walked to most attractions in that area, but we could have easily caught the tram. The tram/ public transport system is worth mentioning as all trips whether 1 stop or 10 is 1.5 Turkish Lira, TRL. No high platforms and clean well kept carriages. The only thing to be wary of is which platform you need to be on, to go the way you require. There are parallel tracks so the frequency of the trams is excellent, but rushing for a tram you can easily pick the wrong platform and have to hop across the tracks when the tram has moved off. It is possible to get the tram and metro to and from the Ataturk Airport terminal to the hotel; we returned that way and there was 1 change of train from tram to metro. The station had a few steps but they were the only ones on the trip which took 50minutes. Total cost of journey to the airport 3 TRL each, <75p. Taxi from the airport was not too expensive at 40TRL but the stress of the taxi driver not knowing where we were going was not a good way to start the break. There was free parking under the hotel and the door man will park your car to keep the street clear, but you have to pick it up from the basement of the hotel yourself. Not an issue as it is close. One issue could be getting the car out, they shuffle the cars to bring yours to the front and if you were pressed for time you may have an issue.

Two slight negatives - the walls, especially in the bathroom, could be thin at times. It never interfered while we were trying to sleep but I did notice it in the mornings when the people in the rooms next door were getting ready in the bathroom. The second negative is that the hotel does not offer free transportation unless you book through their website and stay a certain number of nights. They have since changed that a little since we booked - I'm guessing bookings are probably down due to the economy. One other nice touch - the hotel offers two free waters a day for you to use.

The trip was a city break with my sister and we had a twin room at The President. The hotel is located in a central convenient location tho quite a steep hill if you have walking/mobility issues. There's a tram stop just at the top of the hill (Beyazit) and the tram service is fantastic. Clean, regular and easy to use. You just buy a token for each journey for 1.40 YTL - just over 50p at current exchange rate - put this in the coin operated turnstile on the tram stop and then when the tram arrives you get on. We found it clean, air conditioned and regular. Very impressed........ The hotel itself is well laid out, rooms clean and well decorated and I found bed comfy. There's a spa on the top floor which costs 10euros for each use. It has a steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and a small pool which (according to my sister) was quite chilly - you can use pool for no charge. You are provided with a bathrobe, slippers and a towel and lockers to store your belongings and they have an area for you to relax on loungers. Massages are available for an addtional cost - we didn't have one. After a long day schlepping up and down the hills and roads of Istanbul the spa is nice to come back to and not too expensive. The rooftop bar has a fantastic view over Istanbul and the Marmara Sea but whilst we were there was too chilly to eat out on at night which was a shame. The breakfast was more than adequate and featured scrambled eggs, hot dog sausages and boiled eggs every morning along with cereals, a great selection of breads and pastries, crossaints etc. There's also a toaster (albeit a very slow one) and jams, honey, fruit, yoghurts, fruit juices, coffee & tea, cheeses, cold meats. We did use the \"English Pub\" on our first night but found the prices very expensive - worked out at about \u00c2\u00a37.50 for a bacardi & coke. However, we found that alcohol very expensive in all of the restaurants we ate at. Apart from breakfast didn't eat in hotel. Restuarants down the road at Kumkapi area very pretty but be prepared for some serious hassling by the restuarants to get you in....... Also not overly impressed with the food which we found quite expensive for what you got and not what I would call traditional Turkish food. I live in an area of North London where we have a lot of good Turkish restaurants and i was quite disappointed by standard of food we got there. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly and when I accidently left my jacket in the business center after using the internet it had been handed in and kept by reception who handed it back to me after a short description by me. Use of internet is free and there are 6 terminals in the business center tho internet connection a bit patchy. Overall I would definately recommend this hotel to any visitors to Istanbul. The 5am call to prayer would take some getting used to if you were here for an extended stay but I suspect this would be the same all over Istanbul. The Grand Bazaar is literally just up the road and well worth a visit - be prepared for some serious hassling and haggling - we loved it and had a good rapport with the traders. I would definately return to The President if I went to Istanbul again.......", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Location, Very Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "derbyshirenomad", "ReviewID": "UR20949846", "Content": "The hotel was perfectly situated with the grand bazaar, blue mosque, ayia sofia and bascilla cistern minutes walk away.

The hotel staff was waiting for us, friendly and fluent in English. Our non-smoking room, while not very large, was perfectly fine, clean and comfortable as was the bathroom. We had been traveling a long time and enjoyed nice hot showers. We were also happy to find a stocked mini-bar. After sleeping very well in the comfortable bed, we enjoyed a buffet breakfast in a rooftop dining room with stupendous views. The breakfast was so-so, but that's not why we chose this hotel. After checking out, the hotel stored our luggage and we explored on foot. The hotel is very well located!! We walked to the Blue Mosque in less than 15 minutes and from there to the Haj Sophia and an underground cistern (amazing). In the afternoon, we shopped at the Grand Bazaar, which was practically across the main road nearest the hotel. While in Istanbul, you might also consider taking in a dinner show at the Orient House (next door to the hotel) While pricey, we did enjoy it. Beware, smoking is allowed. We had a cozy table for two, which was a little elevated and separate from most other tables so that helped. There were 3 bellydancers and several folk dancing and musical performances as well as a whirling dervish. The food was fine. So, it was probably worth it.

We booked this hotel based on the brochure photos, the star ratings and the prior reviews from previous guests. The hotel is definitely in a key location, within walking distance to the major attractions and cafes, which is where we ate breakfast. Firstly, I must commend the excellent concierge staff! They are very professional, polite and helpful and are truly the best thing about this hotel by far. The hotel is quite dated with old carpeting, walls needing painting and dark hallways. The elevators barely fit 2 couples. When we first checked in, the room we were given was quite small and had a very poor view looking into the interior courtyard from the second floor with workmen doing renovations. Before we set our bags down, we asked for a better room and our porter immediately called concierge to request another and even went to make the change for us while we waited. Our second room was only slightly larger, but at least we had a better view. There is almost no space for one suitcase, let alone 2. The closet is also quite small. We felt this hotel was more like a 3 star because the aged appearance. They were also laying down new carpeting right outside our door and in the hallway but it looked just as old as the one they were replacing. There is no coffeemaker or kettle provided in the room. We had no issues with the a/c. The bathroom is also small and dated, there were only soap dispensers in the shower and by the sink. One morning after both the soap and shampoo dispensers ran dry, the supervisor came to ask if room service was ok, so I mentioned the empty dispensers. He opened the dispenser and I'm sure went directly to inform housekeeping. Well, when we returned, it had been filled, but soap was put in the shampoo dispenser and the shampoo put in the soap dispenser. So if you are going to room 242, beware! Only other complaint is that they forgot to replace the face towels, but we did not complain as we figured they would be replaced the next day and they were. The breakfast was pretty bad in our opinion. I went only once and never went back! It was all cold-cut meats, tea/cofee that was self-service, bread, cereals and 2 different fruit, one being watermelon. The self-service scrambled eggs were runny and the hard-boiled eggs were more soft than hard. You must visit the rooftop for the fantastic and unbeatable view unless you have a room near the top.
