{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fine for Business Booked at short notice for a business trip, this hotel provided basic 3 star service at a very reasonable price when others were charging extortionate rates. My room was on the top floor of the main hotel building. The room had two single beds, an en suite shower room, and basic, slightly dated furniture. It was however, very clean, and the bathroom had a selection of mini toiletries.  A small TV gave access to around 20 channels, although the only English language programme was the BBC World channel.The hotel restaurant serves breakfast only. This is typical continental breakfast - a good selection of cold meat, cheese and preserves. All of the staff were pleasant and helpfull.The area around the hotel is very quiet. Don't expect to find any shops open in the evening. Neither are there many options for dinner, although I did find one 500m west of the hotel - Haardtwaldeck - but take your German phrase book with you!", "Date": "Apr 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR436922287", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "SnoopD4ve"}, {"Content": "Very good hotel with excellent service Very good hotel.
