LOCATION: The hotel was a literally 5 minutes walk from the \"Union Square\" metro station which was very convenient for travelling to and from the airport in approx. 15 minutes. it is located in the 19th al rigga road and very easy to find from the metro station (there a maps everywhere which tells you where you actually are). You can explore the city very easy because the \"Union Square\" metro station is also the intersection of the two metro lines. You need approx. 15 minutes to the airport and approx. 25 to burj kalifa/dubai mall. The creek is reachable by food in 10-15 minutes and you can take a water bus from there to the old- or gold souk. ROOM Check in was efficient, we got room 101 right next to the elevator but noise was not an issue. The room looks exactly like the pictures show it, only the TV is replaced by a gigantic flat screen. The bathroom (with bathtub) looks a bit used and could be cleaner, but water pressure was good, toiletries provided and towels where clean so nothing to complain for the price paid. The fridge was not plugged in and i took me some time to figure out which light switch actually switches the light off without switching another on but i finally got it! Free Wifi in the rooms if needed. Breakfast wasn`t included so can`t comment. FAZIT: We paid 40 euro/night and got a well located hotel for our purpose (short stopover) and you can\u2019t expect more for the money paid in regarding hotels quite pricy Dubai!", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gdynia, Poland", "Title": "\u201cfree internet\u201d", "Author": "Iwan89", "ReviewID": "UR123310829", "Content": "Very spacious rooms, very close to the metro station.

The staff were cooperative and friendly and ensured that our needs were met with no fuss. The hotel is rated as a 2 star by the Dubai rating agency but would easily meet 3+ Star status in another country. There is a swimming pool and other facilities available in the hotel which would not be normally available in a 2 star hotel. The area is close to a mosque and among a lot of low rent apartments so there are a lot of workers moving along the streets during the day & night.

For starting i can say that the adress is not correcty and i had trouble finding it because is not in the oposite side of the maktoum hospital. The staff at the lobby is very slow and not pleasant with costumers and about the hotel itself i can only say that i only stayed there for 3h and i left!! Rooms smell bad, the bathroom is a joke, air condicioner is very noisy and puts the air directly in your face and the worst of it is that there is a disco club rigth bellow so it\u00b4s impossible to sleep with the noise of the music and people on the street, with taxis pushing the horn untill 4am......i guess this was the baddest experience in my life and even some 8\u20ac hotels that i stayed in thailand were a lot better them this place.
