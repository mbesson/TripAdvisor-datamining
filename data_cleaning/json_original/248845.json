I had found on Trip Advisor the name of the metro stop. After getting out the station, it took us an hour to find the hotel, we didn't know what direction to go in - the hotel was 2 streets away! It is a lovely area with a good choice of shops & restaurants. We got checked in ok, paid on arrival as in most places thes days & went up to our room (there is a lift just big enough for 2 people & cases), to find twin beds, we had requested a double. By this point we were too tired to query it. The room was clean, mini bar beware, lcd tv on the wall, bathroom was clean & the shower had plenty of hot water with a good flow (v important in my book!). Breakfast was buffet style, continental of course. Orange juice, cereals, boiled eggs, preserves, yoghurt & fruit. Tea & coffee were offered & brought to the table with a choice of cold meats, cheese & bread rolls. The staff were friendly & there were plenty leaflets available for days out, trips etc. Had no problems using the free wi-fi.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, UK", "Title": "\u201cVery clean hotel with very helpful and friendly staff, close to transport links\u201d", "Author": "annmcm", "ReviewID": "UR25869144", "Content": "This is a very clean and friendly staff - always willing to help. close to public transport links so very good as a base and easy to get around the city.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Atrium Hotel Berlin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d248845-Reviews-Atrium_Hotel_Berlin-Berlin.html", "Price": "$55 - $123*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Motzstrasse 87</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10779</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "248845", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b7/33/b7332cde263a47abba2cc38b789881d21large.jpg"}}
