Ugly rooms, stained carpets, loose wiring hanging away from the wall, inaccesible window which you could just about see the sky if you strained your head & neck, dirty/marked walls. Our daughter and her boyfriend had to be moved room as rain soaked their bed during the first night. The room they were moved to was damp and had black mould on the walls inside & outside the bathroom so they were moved again. As a goodwill gesture we were given 4 free breakfasts - much appreciated. On the plus side, there was always fresh linen and towels and the beds were quite comfortable and the hotel was generally quiet. The hotel was ideally located for Darling harbour.

I had read the reviews and decided that since it was just one night, was affordable and located right where i needed to be, i was willing to take the chance. i for one found the girls on the front desk extremely lovely. they were both very nice, chatty and helpful. i arrived a bit earlier than the check-in time so sat and waited and the girls kept me informed as to status of my room. when i did get to check-in, i had been upgraded. yes, the lift is old and creaky but it works. when i arrived, the cleaning staff were in the middle of getting all the rooms ready so there were bags of garbage and linen strewn along the corridor. i did find this a bit ominous and does not make for good presentation. the room i was given had a queen bed and two lots of bunk beds. there was a small table, with tea/coffee making items, a wardrobe and not much else. for a room meant to sleep 6, i was rather dubious. i was perfectly happy though as it was just me. the aircon was a bit noisy but it worked however it is situated right above one of the beds so whoever sleeps there will most likely freeze! i wasn't disturbed by outside noise at all. i am an extremely light sleeper and suffer insomnia but hardly heard anything from the street outside my window. the bathroom is old and a bit run down but the water pressure in the shower was great and the water temp was lovely. the knob that controls the ceiling fan was missing and i found that my electronic key and door lock weren't a fan of each other so took me several attempts each time i wanted to enter the room. the bed was comfortable but dipped in the middle so 2 people would have been on top of each other. in all, i'd probably stay here again as i'm really not that fussy about where i sleep so long as its clean, and as a single woman feel safe, which i did, there was an issue with noise from another room but they quietened down at a reasonable hour. the sad thing is that with some work, this could be a quaint boutique hotel. still, as i said earlier, i'd probably stay again.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cnever ever again\u201d", "Author": "VictoriaDavidFrost", "ReviewID": "UR126891717", "Content": "I stayed here and was booked in for 3 nights it was so bad I ended up moving out on the 2nd night and moving to the marriot hotel and paid the $300.00 for this.

The ANA, the Nikko, the Regent and the Intercontinental to just name a few. These were all using other people's money (OPM). I have also stayed at a few budget places like the YHA backpackers and Hotel Ibis near Chinatown. This time I was visiting Sydney with my own money and with my wife, her very particular 73 year old father, and three children; Sam (8), Leah (5) and Julius (2). Comparing it to the Hotel Intercontinental, I have to give this Hotel a 2 out of five rating. The carpets were grubby, there was no bell boy (although the staff were willing to help if asked), there was a light bulb missing from a light stand, the elevator rattled, a tap handle screwed itself off on the shower and the outside windows were dirty. There were always washing bags in the corridor and parking costs were extra and not on site. But the real question to ask about accommodation is would you stay there again and that is a definite, YES. Allow me to explain: When with a family, it is a father's job to make sure the family is happy and safe and the costs don't break the budget. Sure, if money was not an issue I would probably stay at the York or a serviced apartment. Arrons was cheaper than the YHA backpackers. The father-in-law loved the very high ceilings in the room. This is very important with six people sharing the same room. It gives breathing space. It reminded me of my favourite hotel in Melbourne, the Windsor. The whole hotel is non smoking, which is great. The building must has been an old warehouse because the walls were thick brick. The complaints about noise in the other reviews may have been about my kids screaming (as kids do), but I felt better knowing how thick the walls were. We walked to the Aquarium, Sydney Wildlife, the Australian Museum, St Marys and the Fish Market. The free kids playground within 5 min walk at Darling Harbour was a real blessing. Every night of our three night stay we enjoyed, steam chicken, BBQ Pork and Roast Duck with assorted tasties in our room ( a screaming 2 year old in a nice restaurant is not an enjoyable experience for anyone). All of this wonderful food was very cheap and available just around the corner from the hotel. Late shopping at paddies markets (across the road) gave us buckets of cherries, nectarines, grapes, peaches, pears and all the natural goodies for children who will not always eat as much vegetables as you would like. Each bucket was selling for $1 as the growers were trying to get rid of their stock at the end of the day. Many reviews have talked about the elevator, but the place only has a few floors and we mostly used the stairs. Sure it is an issue when carrying heavy luggage, but that should only be twice during the stay and a slightly slow elevator is not cause of stress. The location has been said to be the best part of the hotel, but in my view, the best part of the stay was the cheerful and helpful attitude of the staff. They know their hotel is not perfect yet and they will do whatever they can to make you more comfortable. If you don't like your room, just tell them. The kids loved the Sony Playstation they could borrow from the front and I must say that the staff, no matter who was on duty, was always kind, helpful and professional. The family was happy, could rest well and were safe. I assume with time, the facilities and fittings at this hotel will get better. I just hope they don't spend so much money that they put up the rates. Read into the low reviews of this hotel and you will see most complaints as being about trivial issues. If you are not on a tight budget, stay in a serviced apartment. If you are travelling alone and want to meet people, stay at the youth hostel. If you are stressed out by any blemish or find the occasional noise from other kids etc, intolerable, then stay somewhere else. If you are on a budget, with a family and want to be in the city, this is a good choice.

This was the best example of an optical illusion that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve run across. While the picture does reflect the actual room, the picture quality, angles and drawn curtains hide important clues. To start with, this hotel is a minimally converted former factory, +100 years old. The picture in the lobby (and on the website) shows this. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no soundproofing or wall insulation. In fact, those clean walls you see in the picture are cinder blocks (now with drywall nailed to them) used to construct the original building. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look past those drapes in the room we stayed in, they reveal the back alley. We heard trucks coming and going all night as they were delivering goods to the markets across the alley. The single pane windows look like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re original, single pane. The panes rattle, so any breeze will wake you up (if you happen to fall asleep). The shower was made of cinder block too. Note that the hotel was newly renovated (to them this means new paint only). It was a gloomy and disheartening experience for us. We came from the US and this was supposed to be the highlight of our stay. We wound up doing anything to keep from going back to the room during our 2-day stay and got depressed when it was time to go back. The staff was nice and did the best they could to accommodate us. I felt sorry for them.. they were really trying to make the best of the situation they were in. Though they never said it, it was clear to us that they realized this was a dump. As for the manager, when we complained to him about the room, he mocked us and would not give us a refund that amounted to anything. It amounted to 10% of what we paid. After exhausting all reasoning I could muster with him, my wife fired off at him like anyone would.

They had the same terrible experience. To add insult to injury, the day after we checked-in we found another hotel about 2 blocks away. We decided to check it out and asked if we could see the rooms. While the building was an older one, the rooms had real walls, large double-pane glass and they were plush and quiet. They were only about 140.00 a night, 8 dollars more than Aarons. If we were staying longer I would have taken that loss and moved there. I cannot remember the name of it, but I remember it had 5 or 6 floors. You can imagine how we felt. We booked this little excursion while in Melbourne to get away from a cold spell, so this was done on short notice.

After reading a few reviews on Aarons, I really didn't know what to expect but I must admit, many people who have left negative experiences must have very high expectations as I found this to be a great hotel based on the price ($100 per night including breakfast). The counter staff were overall very helpful in answering my questions (as I had never been to Sydney before, I had to ask them for directions quite a few times and they were always happy to oblige). I found them to be very friendly, engaging in a good chat while they were checking me in, booking my airport bus etc. And they actually knew Sydney (unlike other people I asked over the course of my trip who could have been in bloody Perth and they wouldn't have known the difference). One disappointing point I need to note at this point, when I arrived (11am Friday) I was told I could not access my room until 2pm. I didn't appreciate this a great deal, as I had just come straight from the airport (after a 7am flight from Melbourne) and it also happened to be the wettest day in Sydney's history since 1954. Cue me walking around Sydney (sightseeing, which I had planned to do anyway but the rain may have changed things) in the pouring rain until 2pm! The room was very clean, bathroom & toilet were also very clean (no fan, but no matter) and facilities were what I would expect from a 3 star hotel. Second (and last) disappointing note, the alarm clock speaker did not work. I asked reception to look at it twice, which they said they did but it still didn't make noise. Not comforting when you hate to get up at 4:30am to make a flight! (Wake-up call was made precisely on time though, gold star for that!) Would I stay here again? Absolutely.

I paid $10 for internet for the night (24 hours access that I was told would be lost if I shut my laptop down) and settled in to chat to my children at home in the UK. Suddenly the power went off. I sat in total darkness for almost an hour before texting my husband and asking him to return to the hotel. Our room was electrically locked so I was concerned about getting back into it if I went to find out what was going on. On my husband's return it appeared that the reception area had full power whereas we were still in total darkness (with no air con). The staff were appalling, they were rude and clearly didn't care that I had been alone, 10,000 miles from home in complete darkness that was unexplained and clearly unexpected. They even offered to lend me their plug in fan - and as I explained to them, although the reception area was fully powered the rooms were in darkness so the fan wouldn't work. Apparently this was arranged maintenance and we should have had \"a note under the door\" to tell us about it. (We didn't get this note). The night manager was offensive and rude and abusive.

However, when we got there and it was a bit underwhelming. The rooms are modest, but doable. We got hung up on the fact that when we checked into our room, we were immediately greeted by a number of particularly energetic roaches in the restroom/shower area. We notified the front desk, which didn't seem to see what the big deal was. The female at the front desk then proceeded to lecture me that roaches of that nature were common in that region of the world. I nodded, reminding her that roaches can be found in practically every region of the world, but as a rule of thumb, I don't pay to share a room with them. Anyway, we asked to simply get a refund, which was promptly denied. I will say that I was amazed at the swift, practiced manner with which the female desk attendant denied us our refund. Based on her cheekiness, I'd say that she has to do so daily. I was well aware of the refund policy, so I didn't need to hear her 10 minute diatribe on the finer points of what \"no refund\" means. (SIDE NOTE: Though, my thought was that \"no refund\" was applicable to late cancellations, not customer dissatisfaction with a valid concern.) The desk did offer to upgrade us to another room, which we accepted. There were no roaches, but we opted to stay only the night, cut our losses, and stay somewhere a bit nicer (albeit more expensive).

Ok thats it for the good. The bad would be 1. They seriously need to update there website. I mean come on now. People are going to figure it out ASAP that they got got once they get inside this place. 2. I was slightly horrified when I looked into the shower. It is definitely not something you would want to put your bare feet on. Trust me on this one. Ive been to countries were the shower is water bottles and the bathroom is a hole in the ground. This is unexceptable. I paid 70+ dollars a night and this is what I get? I went to the YHA around the corner and was suprised at the same I couldve gotten for 30 bucks. 3. The noise. It was nonstop music and yelling and my room and clothes smelled like fish and duck from the food places right underneath. The trash trucks are no joke. They run ALL night long. I really wanted to like this place. The cleaning staff was very friendly. Cant really say the same for the people at the counter. It seemed as if you were bothering them everytime you asked for something. I will never come back to this place unless it was deeply discounted. I felt pangs of longing everytime I passed the Holiday Inn right across from the McDonalds. If people do come to this place I would say its best for one or two nights. I was here for longer and my theory is, if you can afford to go to Australia for longer than 2 days then you can afford to stay somewhere a little nicer than here.

We had a standard room with double bed and ensuite bathroom. Where to even begin... When booking, location seemed like it was great (never been to Sydney before), and the price was obviously very good for the location. Well, the location was okay, and price was very good when disregarding all other qualities of hotels in Sydney. And that's about it for the positives. 1) The room was tiny, slate gray concrete walls, high ceilings, and two windows facing a narrow alley. Sound a bit institutional? Well, the building was originally built for cold storage for an area market, and the rooms don't look too far removed from that. The pictures on their website DO NOT do justice to the way the room actually looks. Believe me. I compared after check-in. 2) The bathroom is even tinier. You literally have to sit at an angle on the toilet because there is no room for your knees as the sink/cabinet is in the way. 3) The room was filthy. I found a roach on the wall of the shower upon first entering and looking around after check-in. There were \"adult hairs\" all along the base of the walls and corners in the bathroom. There was a nasty layer of dust (?) under the pillows on the bed against the wall. Cigarette burns on the carpet. Now before the manager responds here and says I should have informed the front desk... I DID inform the front desk the next morning. (We arrived the previous evening and had no desire to have to clear out of the room for them to re-clean after first arrival.) They assured me they would re-clean the room. Well, when we returned, the room had been turned over. But first thing I did was check the walls and corners of the bathroom. Same disgusting state as before. 4) Building certainly does not feel secure. Front door was never locked while we were there, and nobody was at reception (and we entered late a couple of nights; reception is staffed 24 hours, but there is a staff room around the corner from the desk which does not have view of the door). Stairs next to the elevator is always unlocked, and each floor off it is unlocked. No keyhole on door. And no deadbolt; only the electronic lock. 5) Room was VERY loud. As I said above, our room was on an alley. About 4 in the morning or so, we were awoken by trucks in the alley (delivering or picking up from businesses on the alley I would assume), and this continued occasionally along with a loud garbage truck up until our alarm went off at 7:00am. 6) Location is fine, but not great. We certainly did not spend any time directly near the hotel. Lots of tourist spots and good neighborhoods within long walking distance, but Sydney, perhaps more than any other city I've been to, is flooded with hotels in every neighborhood. (I'm guessing it is because of the old British law that only hotels could serve alcohol?) Point is, location should not be the primary selling point for this place. I think that's about it; my feelings are probably pretty clear. Unfortunately, this place left a bad taste in our mouth for Sydney, which really is a beautiful and fun city. The price was undoubtedly good, but I have no doubt someone could find a much better place without going too dramatically higher. This place should be classified as an expensive backpacker, nothing more.

I got a very good last minute deal that I had to jump on. With no time to plan very well, I found an Australian based website for hotel accommodations. I found the Aaron hotel and used a website based map to make sure it was in the central area of Sydney. The advantages of the hotel are: 1. Price- I paid about $89 for the night and most hotels were charging between $140 to almost $300. 2. Location- It was in a perfect spot. The central train station for Sydney was around the block and about two blocks away. The Darling Harbour tourist entertainment area was about a 15 minute casual walk away. It was very close to Chinatown, so I got a cultural immersion experience that I did not expect. The tour buses for the city were less than two blocks away. The hotel is very basic, I mean very basic. If you are looking for special service and facilities, stay elsewhere. The room was small and a little cramp, but since I was traveling solo that was fine by me. The staff was very friendly and really made effort to get me at room (after a 14 hour flight) much earlier than normal check-in. The facilities were old, but quite adequate. I was not planning to live in the room. There was a restaurant, but with all of the eating that was so close by, I never even tried to use the restaurant. Also there are a lot of hostels in the area, so I saved money for me to pay for my meals at those cafeterias instead. My next two nights were spent at a fancy Marriott (burning points that I'd saved up). However, I have absolutely no problem staying at the Aaron again.

If you have ever stayed at Aarons, you know I'm clearly joking. If there was a zero-star option, I would have chosen that. Having booked a twin room, with two roll-away beds, we arrived to find that they had booked us in a TINY room, barely enough space to open the door and walk inside, and no room even to sleep on the floor. Once we informed the staff that we had been given a 100% assurance that two roll-away beds could be accommodated in the room, we decided to seek alternative accommodation, as there were no rooms left in the hotel. Clearly, as the hotel staff had stuffed up our booking we assumed there would be a hassle-free refund forthcoming. To my utter disbelief and disgust, the staff rudely told us that as we were cancelling our booking, we would not be receiving a refund. This despite the fact that they had mucked up our booking and it was through no fault of our own that we were no longer able to stay at the \"hotel\". While this was going on, there was a domestic fight two stories up which was clearly audible in the ground floor reception, with the words \"don't touch me!\" repeated many times. We raised this with staff in case they wanted to inform the local police. They replied that if they called the police about every domestic at the hotel that the police might as well live there permanently. I don''t think they were joking .... While we were disputing our bill, the manager informed us (rudely) that unless another guest came and booked the room we were going to be in, then there would be no refund. Thankfully, an elderly gentleman arrived at just this moment and took our room, much to the pleasure of the greedy manager, who was clearly only concerned with the bottom line. It is unbelievable they were trying to con us out of our money when the hotel was at 100% occupancy. Now onto the hotel room, which we inspected before we left ... After spending about five minutes in the lift while it took us up one floor, I have never seen a smaller, more cramped, dirty, and generally depressing room. After noticing some suspicious stains on the bed linen, we were assured that this was the pattern on the linen, and that the sheets would be replaced at the end of our stay. I have stayed in the Sydney Central YHA (which is approximately the same price), and found it to be clean, modern, attractive, and with enormous airy bathrooms. At Aarons, one almost has to get in the shower before one is able to close the bathroom door, as the bathroom is tiny (and mouldy). I would recommend this room to anyone who is booking the room for a friend and wants to play a mean practical joke on them.

Matters were not helped by the unpleasant odour that pervaded the room. Initial impressions hovered between disappointment and disbelief. Further examination of the room revealed tired decor, a curtain partially detached from the curtain rail, the room door security catch broken and non functional and ill fitting sash windows which allowed a draught from the cold Sydney evening to enter immediately above the bed. We had problems finding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153en suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bathroom but discovered it when we opened a sliding door assuming it to be a wardrobe. Indeed it revealed an area no bigger than a small wardrobe into which had been inserted a moulded plastic unit containing a shower, miniature wash hand basin and a toilet. Doubtless the achievement of cramming so many bathroom facilities into such a small space has been enshrined in the Guinness Book of Records. However, as a bathroom it was effectively non functional but at least we had discovered the source of the unpleasant odour! Whilst we were still coming to terms with our fate, there was a loud sound of banging, shouting and screaming coming from outside our room. Upon investigation we found we found a number of adults running up and down the corridor firing fire extinguishers at one another. We went down to Reception to report the incident and to express our total dissatisfaction with our room. We were met with an unsympathetic blank stare and not a word was spoken to us in response! From here we went out for a meal where we decided the only option open to us was to seek accommodation at the Holiday Inn, a mere five minute walk away. We secured a room for four nights starting the following day. The room which proved excellent in every way cost a mere $19 a night more than the$130 a night charged for Aarons. Returning from meal, we had to navigate our way through a number of people sitting on the hotel steps eating food from paper wrappers.

We ate the complimentary breakfast which was satisfactory.", "Date": "February 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNot a good experience\u201d", "Author": "silverstreamgirl", "ReviewID": "UR2877669", "Content": "We stayed in Aarons Hotel in August 2004 and were so disappointed with the accommodation. The windows rattled so loud in the wind we thought they were coming in, the smell in the room was awful and the smell of the cooked breakfasts in the foyer (restaurant) on arrival was dreadful. It made us spend most of our time out and about the sights as the hotel was too dreadful to enjoy!
