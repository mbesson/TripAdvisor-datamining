The hotel is some distance from town, but close to tram stops, which take you in within about 15 minutes. We also got a taxi home one night and it was only 21 euros, which we thought was reasonable. The hotel itself is large with really good rooms. The rooms are very clean, well decorated and have lovely bathrooms with bath and separate shower. They also have satellite TV with UK and European channels. We ate in the hotel prior to leaving and the food was pretty good and reasonably priced. The hotel also has a great secure car park facility, which is actually within the hotel unlike many that we encountered in our travels and was reasonably priced at 15 euros per night. The hotel also has wifi and offers free access to a pc, printer etc, which makes a change from the hotels that charge for these facilities. The only down side to our stay was the 35 euros that we paid for a 'treat me special' package, which included bath robes, slippers, turn down service, with water and fruit delivered to your room. The turn down service didn't happen on either night we stayed and we mentioned this to the hotel who then reduced the cost to 25 euros. This is the only thing that we could find fault with though, so pretty minor. Considering the cost of this hotel compared to its city centre competitors, I think it offers brilliant value for money and having seen some of the alternatives that we looked at, we are glad we chose to be in this area rather than the city centre.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWill come back\u201d", "Author": "EndsBirds", "ReviewID": "UR128215966", "Content": "Nice hotel, nice staff - staying there since month on a regular basis.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great service\u201d", "Author": "olivierp2008", "ReviewID": "UR128118376", "Content": "Fashion hotel is really a nice place to stay.

I find the location (close to the airport and next to a highway) convenient. However, for the SECOND time now they have failed to provide a wake-up call when one was requested. The first time this happened, two months ago, I went to the front desk, explained who took my request the prior night (did it in person at the desk), and indicated how lacking a hotel-provided alarm clock all guests are dependent on this service. I received a rather hollow apology. I expected a follow-up from the manager. None came. Then, it just happened again this week. This time I called from the room to request a 7:30AM wake-up call, and again, no call came. I was late to my meeting and potentially embarrassed myself in front of my clients. On the way back I stopped by a convenience store and bought a travel alarm clock. With a front desk service that bad It is ridiculous that no clocks are in the room. Rooms are nice, although very cold (other reviews indicate the thermostats don't work and my impression is the same). Cleaning crew is hit and miss. Sometimes the rooms are nicely put together when you come back, sometimes they are not. Iron boards left out will be found in the same place when you come back at night (really? Putting them back is not part of fixing up the room?). Restaurant is good, but if you do not watch it they will serve you beer in a dirty glass (they go straight from the soapy water into the shelf). Keep an eye on the glass they use, or order bottled beer if picking up bugs is not part of your travel plans.

Our room had a bathroom which had a bath with shower over it, along with a separate walk-in shower as well. The toilet is totally separate (maybe the hotel could consider putting little sinks/handbasins in the toilets so that guests can wash their hands before leaving). Rooms had all facilities you could ask for - good sized, comfortable bed, flat screen tv with a choice of channels (including English ones), dressing table, plenty of wardrobe space, tea and coffee making facilities, vending machine with drinks and snacks, small refrigerated area under the vending machine for keeping drinks, etc. in, hairdryer, complimentary toiletries, small seating area with chairs and a table. We could not think of anything else we needed. The staff were very friendly; I contacted them several times by email before going and they responded quickly and efficiently, and at the hotel we were always greeted with a smile. Breakfast at the hotel was plentiful and set us up for the day, with lots of options. Unfortunately we did not have time to try the cocktail bar, restaurant or spa so cannot comment on them.

The food in the lobby bar was very good and we ate there two nights. The food on the menu in the hotel restaurant was a bit too fancy! We were a little disappointed with the Skyy bar as it was not busy and seemed to lack atmosphere. We basically just had our free cocktails there and left! We expected it to be a lot bigger and a lot more lively from previous reviews, but maybe this was just the time that we were there.

The hotels breakfast was well above average, with lots of fruit juices, tea, coffee ect. Hot english selection including bacon, sausage, beans, mushroom, egg and hash brown. Lots of fresh fruit and the usual continental options. The area which you have your breakfast is also very nice and relaxing. The location, we found no problem with it, we timed the walk to the tram stop and with four of us walking and talking it took 8 minutes, and as for the road work complaints from other reviews, this became a little joke between us as we saw one very small pile of rubble.

Really good price. \u00c2\u00a3239 for 3 nights bed and breakfast including return flights from Bristol. Really easy to get to the hotel from airport. Train station at airport and one stop to Lelylaan costing about 2 euros each way. Five to ten minute walk from Lelylaan Train Station to hotel. Hotel was really lovely. Shame I forgot to take my bathers, forgot about the swimming pool etc but you can buy them if you want from the hotel for 12 euros. We arrived early but only had to wait a few moments and our room was ready. Gorgeous room, really trendy just like the hotel. Gorgeous shower in the bathroom. My only complaint would be that the bathroom door is glass and you can see everything. I think all the rooms were the same. Ok I suppose if you dont mind someone seeing you sitting on the toilet! I personally dont so we took it in turns to leave the room when that time came! Michael, from reception rang us after we had been in the room about 2 minutes just to check that everything was ok. To get into Amsterdam centre, you can get a tram, a number 1 or 17, its about 2 euros for an hour ticket or 7 euros which lasts 24 hours. Its a bit of a treck to the tram stop as there are roadworks on the hotel side, so no pavement and about a ten minute walk. The hotel advised us to go this way but when its blowing a gail and raining which in our case it was, its an awful treck. We took our life into our hands and walked on the hotel side and dodged the traffic. Must quicker! The sky bar was pleasant and staff very friendly. On the Friday night tho we couldnt use the sky bar as there was a function going on there so sat in the downstairs bar area. We ate at the hotel on the first night from the bar menu. Steak sandwich and chips and it was fine. Breakfast was a choice of the usual fruit, salamis, cheese, ceareal etc but also a cooked breakfast was available at no extra cost and this was all buffet style. I have no complaints with the hotel at all. Immaculately clean and staff all helpful and polite. My only reservation with the hotel is that it is a way out and after trudging the streets of Amsterdam all day, by the time you get a tram back, especially winter time, you dont really want to go back out in the evening. I think we missed out on quite a lot because of this. If I went back to Amsterdam again I would definately stay more central enjoying the flexibility of being able to pop back and fore to the hotel room and also saving on transport costs which in all cost us over the 4 days, 56 euros.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWestCord Fashion Hotem A'Dam, December 2011\u201d", "Author": "Gen G", "ReviewID": "UR121690379", "Content": "Hi, The hotel is really lovely.

We stayed 2 nights at this great hotel. We opted for a taxi to and from Schipol at a cost of about 35 euro one way. A bit pricey but more convenient than walking with suitcases. We were checked into our room on arrival without any problem even thought we were early, about 1200pm. The rooms are great, clean, tidy, modern with an easy to use in room safe. Bonus to have the bbc channels available. Noise wasn't a problem as we overlooked the back garden. Echoing other reviews the door on the bathroom was frosted glass, as was the window between the bathroom and bedroom. This was not a problem for us but if you are sharing with outher family members might be a bit uncomfortable. We had a large double which consisted of two beds pushed together, which again wasn't a problem. However, we would have preferred to have one massive quilt instead of 2 single quilts, and two extra pillows would have been nice but that's personal preference. One issue we had was with the room key. It was reassuring for security that you had to swipe the key to get into the hallway and the room. However 2 keys would have been ideal. As the key also turns the power on in the room it made doing things seperately in the winter evenings a bit awkward. We either went together to get ice or one of us was left in the dark for a few minutes while the other got the ice, and the same thing to go out and have a cigarette.So get 2 keys on check-in. However saying all that if any of it had really been a problem for us we could have easily remedied it by going to the main desk. The only problem we did have was when taking an afternoon siesta someone knocked the door and as my other half bolted out of bed to get it, the door opened and someone said hello. On seeing my other half they immediately apologized and shut the door. Not sure if they were doing spot checks on how well the room was cleaned or what as no explanation was offered. It could have been really awkward. I would reccommend that they knock twice before entering. Overall a great place to stay. I would reccommend it to anyone and would not hesitate to stay there again. Quick note. When reading reviews before booking I was concerned about how to get to the tramstop and how far it was from the hotel. It is actually quite simple. Come out of hotel main entrance go down the stairs,right under the overpass and turn right. Less than a five minute walk down the street is the tram stop. Tram 1 or 17 take you straight into Centraal. There was some work being done on a bridge on the main road, but they weren't working while we were there and weren't obstructing the sidewalk at all.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Just Brilliant ... amazing hotel..

The hotel is kept extremely clean, the decor is divine (sorry had to say that) in a word its exceptional. If there is one and only one downfall, that would be that it is not closer to the centre of the city. Even before arriving a member of the Reception Staff (Micha\u00c3\u00abl van Es whom I cannot praise higly enough) went the extra mile to assist me in making this stay extra special which was a surprise birthday present for my fiance. He organised a spendid reception on behalf of the hotel and even recommended booked and reserved an evening entertainment. I have to say also that my fiance has a disabilty and Micha\u00c3\u00abl even organised it so that our room was not too far from the lifts .. now how cool is that!!!). Also if you get the opportunity at least have one meal in the restaurant AND visit the Skyy Bar. I highly recommend this hotel. [Ps on the downside was the spa area this was most unfortunately. When we arrived we were met by (I presume) the spa manager, who approached us saying (while wiping his face on a towel) that it was a hygenic area and we could not look around. He also repeated a couple of times that the spa was not part of the hotel and we had to speak to him if we wanted access (the is information in the room and other notices which explaines what is free access i.e. the pool and the gym and what has to be paid for) In fact he was so obnoxious that my partner who needed to use the pool as part of his rehabilitation exercises and another reason for booking the hotel, would not return! The man was AWFUL. Thank goodness they are \"not part of the hotel\". The spa area looked lovely, the facilities are amazing but the staff could do with a bit of training when it comes to courtesy. I too have worked in a boutique hotel spa and I would NEVER approach or speak to clients in that tone.

A taxi driver quoted us 40 Euros to take us to the hotel, which we felt rather expensive so said no and quite rightly so as now knowing the distance 20 Euros would be acceptable. My partner and I, after asking in the airport information travelled to the hotel via the connections bus which takes you directly to the Fashion Hotel (or any hotel for that matter) for a flat rate of 15.somthing Euros each. The connections point where to book it is located in the airport too.

We were able to leave the luggage there and he even sorted it out so we could go to our rooms at around 12am rather than 3pm, which was fantastic! He gave us some advice how to get around and all the staff was friendly and welcoming. To travel from the hotel into main Amsterdam is very easy, the tram is a 5min walk away max 10 if taking a leisurely stroll. (I noticed people saying on here that its further, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming they must of walked to the next tram stop down, or have difficulty in walking.) Any way my point is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not far. There is not really much around the hotel area but once on the tram everything is within 20mins max of the hotel. To get around use tram 1 or 17 to central station however tram 1 is much better as it takes you past more areas you are likely to get out for entertainment or restaurants etc. In the evening we went to the bar at the top of the hotel for cocktails, the guy serving was superb and the cocktails were worth the money.. lush! The check out time is 12am, so we went for a quick swim in the pool before we left.

The festival itself was mental (and may I recommend it!) and I didn't realise until on the day that all trams and taxi's in central Amsterdam were stopped because the crowds are so big. This meant getting around in the city was a little difficult if you don't know your way around. On arrival from the airport, which must have been 15 minutes away by tram (trams 1 and 17 will get you to the hotel - check with the tourist information at the airport to find out the routing) we arrived early at 8am and was told our room would be ready by 12pm so we went around the city to explore. When we came back around 1pm to be told our room still wasn't ready. Reception gave us an alternative room so we could sleep while our proper room was being prepared. Which was a little frustrating as we wouldn't have come back so early if our room wasn't finished. By 3pm all was resolved and we moved into our proper room. The room itself is lovely - really funky decor, comfy bed, nice telly with some English speaking channels - news channels too. The bathroom and bath were really lovely - it had a walk-in shower too which was nice! Breakfast was really expensive at the time of booking but its worth me mentioning that there is no-where nearby to eat so we did decide to book this while at the hotel. The hotel kindly gave us our first morning's breakfast for free (after we explained the room mishap) which was much appreciated. Breakfast was great - and I do recommend booking it as there is a wide choice of cooked breakfast, yoghurt, toast, fruit, croissants, juice, coffee etc so although it might seem pricey - its definitely worth doing. The reception were really helpful - taking our luggage while we were sight-seeing, helping us with our room and getting around the city - they helped us plan our routes and all spoke great English. On Saturday early on, we went to Vondelpark to see the little market stalls set up and buy some orange novelty gear - Queen's Day is all about walking the streets and drinking in the atmosphere - and having some Heineken! So we walked around for a bit - the main areas on Queen's day are: Jordaan, Dam Square, Museumplein, and Nieuwmarkt. Ladies, please note the amount of broken glass that ends up on the floor throughout the day, so don't wear any open-toed shoes. All in all this hotel is fantastic and although I rate it, personally I recommend the Red Light District area for hotels. On my trip to Amsterdam before, I stayed in the Red Light District and it meant I was right in the centre of everything and very close to Central Station.

There is a safe concealed inside one of the drawers and you can set your own lock combination. Inside the other drawer we found coffee making facilities and there is also a minibar.

The door is glass so you can see through but this wasn't a problem for us as a couple.

My daughter tried pool and fitness rooms and was very pleased of both. We took breakfast only on two of the four days, as we wanted to try some local alternatives. This was no problem. The breakfast buffet offered all you need, nothing extreme exceptional but all food was fresh and everything was provided until the end of the breakfast time(!!!) The location is a bit outside of the city center, good to reach by car. Parking in the hotel garage is quite expensive. Near the hotel is the Vondelpark.

Amsterdam is not that big and public transport system is well developed, the hotel was easy to reach from Schipol airport - 1 train stop and about 10min walk. The central area of the city is within 15min by tram and the tram stop is about 5min from the hotel, we've never waited for the tram more than a couple of minutes. The truth is the road works are there, but it doesn't look messy and we were not disturbed by the noise as it's all going on in some distance from the hotel. I think it might be difficult for parents with prams as it's up and down the bridge to get to the tram stop but otherwise it's fine. But Amsterdam is for tourists who can walk miles anyway :) The hotel staff was nice and friendly, speaking English (and probably some other languages), during our stay we have asked a few questions and they've been helpful. On arrival we've received welcome info pack, also some magazines were in the room. We had a double room, the room size was good (so much bigger than Paris hotels))), there was a proper sized double bed (hate it when they just move together 2 beds, but that was not the case). There was enough storage space, the room was clean, some international TV channels, everything was working fine. Free WiFi in the room. The bathroom was separated from the room with a glass door, which we liked. There was a sink, bath and a shower in the other corner, toiletries provided and renewed during our stay. Toilet was located away from the sleeping area and has a proper (not glass) door :) Have to mention though there's no fridge in the room. The vending minibar has water/juice/alcohol/chocolate bar selection; also there's a kettle with a free tea/coffee but with the breakfast price so high I'd rather had something in the room. We haven't found much places to eat around the hotel itself and we were not keen to pay 40 euros for a breakfast for 2 in the hotel, so we just had tea&croisant in the morning and were off to the city where we could get whatever we wanted in 15min. We didn't use spa or the swimming pool so can't say anything, the same for the restaurant. The bar on the 10th floor is nice, not too expensive, good selection of cocktails and snacks.

(Taxi cost 28 euros - and we were given a card for a 20% discount off the return journey). Arrived at the hotel after approx a 10 minute drive and although check-in is not till 3pm we were welcomed and swiftly checked in. Our room was on the 8th floor, and the lift (there were 3) was easily big enough for me in my wheelchair, my husband and our case, plus others. The room was a nice size, large, especially by dutch standards, and as has been said before, has a seperate toilet room, which you find as you enter your room; the room is equiped with a large flat screen tv (BBC1, 2 & 3 and channel 5, plus CBBC, british channels plus cnn and other language programmes) tea/coffee making facilities, in a handy pull out drawer, laptop size safe, (with charger plug built in), mini bar was novel, a sort of vending machine rather than a fridge - very stylish, with cans of coke and heiniken both costin 3.50 euros each - charged to your room, so you dont need to find coins to vend the items. There was ample space to hang / store clothes and the wardrobe also housed a ironing board/iron. There is also a desk area with chair and also 2 comfy chairs. Must not forget the bed - lovely, large and comfortable, as were the pillows, and just as in the hotel photos; we had a great sleep. The bathroom houses the bath, and a seperate shower area, plus sink, and hairdryer. The bath was lovely and deep and quite long - well it would be for me as I am only 1.51! - and yes it is seperated from the main bedroom area by glass door with frosty glass panels which more serve to ensure you know that there is a door there than to preserve modesty - however after 25 years together, this did not bother us, but it might faze others especially if business collegues. The rest of the hotel is very stylish and in keeping with the general ambiance of the hotel. We did not partake in breakfast - prefering to have a lazy lie in (after all we were on holiday) and then an early lunch in the bar. The bar area is nice and seemed to be used by lots of people for business meetings; the staff in the bar are very helpful, polite and attentive however the one problem we did encounter, purely as a wheelchair user, is that the way the bar area is set out, area's that seemed more 'set up' for a cozy 2 people were in the area of high bar stools, which leaves the table inaccessable and your view that of your partner - and everyone elses bottom. This left the only option to sit on a table that was set with large sofa and 3 or 4 other beautiful (and heavy) chairs, one of which we needed to move to be able to sit near each other comfotably. There were a couple of other, still large, tables that would have been more appropriate but at the time they were in use. Some other seats were available but again larger tables and seat lower than my wheelchair. No big deal, just a problem for wheelchair users that most 'style' hotels fail to realise. Bar prices were fair (2.50 e for a coke/ 4.50 for large beer), and our lunch was good value for what we got especially compared to breakfast prices. On day 1 I had an omelette (12euros) and hubby had French onion soup (6 euros) and on our last day we had spaghetti (12 euros) both had too much and left some, but it was delicous. The Pool was nice, decent size for a hotel however for disabled people not so good. My hubby went down to do a recki for us and although there were 2 steps (1 is not very deep so wheels cannot easily be balanced on it) the main problem was that there was no changing facilities for disabled people nor any family/multi sex changing rooms. This was solved by changing in our rooms and paying 4.50 each for use of a bath robe to 'cover up' to get from room to pool and back, and although it is mentioned in the hotel booklet that bathrobes cost 4.50, it isnt mentioned that there is no other way for disabled people to change - other than in public, another cost for disabled people that able bodied need not pay out for, and yet another way we are made to feel like an inconvenience. To add insult to injury, we were told quite forcefully from the grumpy lady that if we did not return the bath robes to them imediatley after taking then to our room we would be charged an additional 60 euros! Once in the pool area, there is a nice seating area, as well as the pool and a shower, and sauras & soleriums - behind other doors - at extra cost. The pool is accessed, as usual by vertical steps into the pool; we have had much practice at getting in and out of pools over the years, so I managed to get in/out with hubbys help in our normal manner, and then walking a few steps with my walkingstick to my chair - parked as near as possible to the pool. Well, our last complaint was that the grumbly lady came and moved my slippers that were placed in the area near my chair so that I didnt slip when getting from pool edge to chair! She needs to do not only a disability awareness course but a customer service course - something that I could not say about any other member of staff from the hotel, so hopefully it is just that the pool is rum by another company, if not she is not the asset the rest of the staff are. We were going to use the restaurant just on our first night, and eat out on our second night, but the food was sooo good on the first we had our second nights meal there too. Yes, it is not cheap - but it is not expensive by any means, and for the amount and quality of food you get, the service and the taste of the food it is well worth the cost. My favorite starter was the jerusalham artichoke cappacino which is served with a mushroom brushetta - every mouthful was so tasty and served to appeal visually also. Hubbys favorite starter was scollops with a hazelnut crust, which I also couldnt risist a taste of too! the steak for maincourse (22 euros) -served with a bowl of fries, side salad and pepper sauce - was so delicous and such large pieces of meat that I left almost half! On our second night, I had monkfish and hubby again had the steak. On the last night we pigged out and also had dessert - hazelnut souffle is to die for (that was hubby choice but I ate most of it and wouldnt give it him back!) The food alone is reason to go back to this hotel. We also, dont say suprise surprise, visited the skky bar on the 10th floor. The panoramic view of the city is a delight and the cocktails are moreish, plenty of alcohol, but so smooth and enjoyable. Again, the service was impecable and very friendly, and we spent a pleasant evening there. It was a tad cool in there, but as more people get in the tempertaure would rise so I guess later at night and at weekends it is not so cool. Cocktails cost 8-10 euros each. The area around the hotel is newly built and the pathways, in places, are stillunder construction, which gave us problems getting out and about, even to the tram stop 250 meters out of the hotel, but this is (a) not the hotels fault, and (b) should be completed in a few months, so should not have any bearing on visiting the hotel, even with the work, there was no noise from it during our stay. The hotel would be convenient for the station, the tram stop is close and is opposite rembrandtpark, with a canal at the rear of the hotel (accessed by lift to -2 and exit from pool area). To get back in to the hotel at this entrance you need your room key, which is also needed to access the lift/stairwells. This is a good security measure, however the fact that we could not get anywhere from the main entrance, meant that as we had checked out, we could not go for a walk and come back for our case which we has left in the luggage room (another good security feature of luggage room is that it is ticketed) because we wouldnt be able to get back in to the hotel or back to reception - having now no key! so we were actually stuck either in the hotel (which we chose - having lunch and a coffee) or else get to the airport 3 hours earlier than earliest check in time. Again a problem that able bodied guest would not encounter - unless they have a baby toddler with a pram/stroller, and hopefully one that will be solved when the work in the vacinity is complete. In summery, we had a lovely stay, the staff from cleaners, to reception, bar to restuarant (with great exception of pool!) were excellent food was delicous and our stay was pleasant and relaxing.

The West Cord Fashion Hotel in Amsterdam might be considered a bit off, but seriously, it took about 15 minutes to go to the city center (tram No 1 and 17) and that isn't such a big deal, is it? Tram station was close, approx 5 minutes walk (if you not carry tons of luggage of course), and the trams come with just a few minutes in between, even during night, so the ride home was never a problem and you never needed to catch a specific tram in the timetable; just go to the station and a tram will appear within minutes.

It puts on a good breakfast and has good conference facilities. The main issue is the location. The hotel makes a good first impression. A proper four-star. The reception staff were efficient, helpful and flexible. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the hotel is based on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fashion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so I guess you could call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upscale funky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lots of bold colours. We loved the room. Fairly spacious, well lit, modern, new-looking, clean. Big comfortable bed. Interesting fabrics and design. Modern, luxury bathroom, with separate WC. Lots of closet space & counter space. Excellent coffee-making facilities, fridge, ironing board. Our room did not have an interesting v iew, but then we were on a lower floor. Quiet, even though close to the motorway. Free wifi. (A huge factor when choosing a hotel, I find.) The TV had a number of English channels, and channels in other languages. However, the TV had an unusual channel-display system that included an annoying slight delay when changing channels. The breakfast spread was extensive, varied and classy, although not perhaps in the luxury range. Eggs scrambled or boiled. Various sticky buns. OK coffee. Very nice fruit and juices. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not cheap if you order it separately (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac14 I think) so try to get it included. The cuisine produced by the kitchen here, as you might expect from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fashion hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is quite good. I had lunch here twice, and it felt positively luxurious. The conference facilities and services are excellent. The fitness centre is more than a typical hotel gym, but less than a proper health club. It has a 15 m pool and a small facility with about 12 expensive-looking cardio and strength machines. These are free for hotel guests. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see dumbbells or barbells, but maybe they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there -- they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let me look. The sauna costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10. When I was ready to go in to train, I was subjected to an off-putting inspection, lecture and serious attitude. Save yourself the trouble: Bring a clean towel and clean your shoes thoroughly before attempting entry -- and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look them in the eyes. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re clearly looking for reasons not to let in the hotel guests. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an extensive, welcoming facility. There is no other gym nearby, as far as I can see. Indeed, there is almost nothing at all nearby (except the highway). So if working out is important to you, find another hotel. The first thing you notice about the WestCord Fashion Hotel is its location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a part of Amsterdam that no-one really goes to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 500 metres from something called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World Fashion Centre\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but that is hardly a site worth a special trip. The parking was a whopping \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 a night, even though the hotel is located along the motorway in the middle of nowhere. If they are trying to get motorists to stay here, this seems like a strange way to do it. The location is convenient only in the sense that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the A10 northbound near the S106 (Cornelis Lelylaan). So getting here by car from the motorway is not that difficult. Still, the A10 is hardly an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153open road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The hotel is about 3 kms from the A4/A10 motorway interchange, one of the busiest in the entire country. Come here at rush hour (from Schiphol or anywhere else) and you are certain to be caught in a serious traffic jam. Nor is the hotel particularly close to Schiphol, despite what they tell you. You might think, well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll park my car at the hotel and take public transport into the centre of town. That is conceivable, because tram 1 and tram 17 do come out this far. However, you have to walk several hundred metres to get to these stops. Surprisingly for Amsterdam, no tram stops beside the hotel. If you plan to come back after a night on the town, you have to rely on Nightbus 353, which stops at Lelylaan Station. From there, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 500 m. walk to the hotel in what seems to be a relatively safe neighbourhood. I really urge the hotel to issue guests with a sheet of paper with simple and precise instructions on how to get to Amsterdam (and back) by public transport. When we were there, the hotel was filled with Italian bus tourists. There were others, but it was mostly this at breakfast. Somehow this hotel suited this particular group perfectly. This hotel is perfect for motorists who want to stay near Amsterdam, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to go to the centre of Amsterdam at all. The location didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for me personally. While I would definitely recommend the hotel itself (5/5), I would not recommend its location (1/5). My \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is therefore a qualified one and my rating tries to balance these two factors.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turkey", "Title": "\u201cA great stay in a real fashion hotel!\u201d", "Author": "SigoSema", "ReviewID": "UR75574512", "Content": "We wanted to stay in a clean, modern and easy access hotel on our first trip together to Amsterdam and Westcord Fashion was the right choice.

The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern. The bed is very comfortable, and the air conditioning works well and quietly. Bathroom: The bathroom is modern, and has a bath and a separate shower area. The dividing door between the bathroom and the main room is made of sliding glass - so it's fine if two people are sharing who are intimately acquainted, but it would be less suitable for two friends on holiday.

There is no egg/omelette station, but there is a supply of scrambled and boiled eggs. There is fresh fruit, cereal, bread and cold cuts. There are also fried products, including low-quality sausages. Facilities: The advertised free wi-fi throughout the hotel was not working. The network could be found, but when a connection was attempted it failed every time within the rooms - and only in the lobby it was possible to connect. Even then, the connection was very unstable, and standing next to the router it still failed every time a few seconds after connecting. There were two computers in the lobby with internet access which were free to use for guests. The swimming pool is free for guests to use, but the sauna and steam room are not. The pool area had a rule whereby guests were not allowed to walk in outdoor shoes - and the area outside the door to the pool had a rule wherey guests were not allowed to walk in bare feet. A normal policy, yes - but the problem is that the changing rooms are entirely separate, with no direct access from the changing room to the pool. This meant that - in order to comply with their regulations - after using the pool it was necessary to stand precisely on the threshold of the door between the pool area and the dry reception area, and hop on one leg with the door open while drying the other foot with a towel in order to change into one's shoes. No other combination of action or location would have satisfied them that we complied with their rules. This needs to be reviewed! General comments: The hotel is very nice, but it is understaffed. During breakfast, there were no clean tables available - and the reason was because there was only one girl serving, whose job it was to book in guests, clean tables and re-set them - among other things. We had to clear a table ourselves and then look for hard-to-find clean cutlery. The girl was rushed off her feet: not her fault, it's just that they needed more staff. Overall: We paid under \u00c2\u00a3100 per night for two people, and compared with the advertised rack rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac245 per night it was great value. The important things were excellent: rooms and cleanliness.

As far as the cafe/restaurant goes, this was all fairly average. I thought that prices at the restaurant were on the expensive side. The Skyy bar on the 10th floor was funky with decent cocktails but fairly quiet.

I thought the hotel was just a bit far out and I wasn't particularly comfortable walking alone at nights to the hotel as a solo traveller. The closest grocery store from the hotel is in Lelylaan station which is a good 15-20 minute walk. Overall, my stay at this hotel was a fairly average experience.

(and some very helpful Amsterdammers). It only takes about 15 minutes to get there by train and tram. The hotel is almost brand new and the interior is very modern and fashionable. The room was very clean and we had a huge bed. I wasn't impressed that the bathroom had a see-through window, though?!? The toilet was also separate. (Thank goodness, but why???). Our room faced the road and the traffic from the road was quite noisy which sometimes made it difficult to sleep. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. We were very pleased that we were able to leave our luggage behind the desk before we checked in and after we checked out to save us carrying them around town. Breakfast was good, but the tables were not always cleared away. We ate at the hotel two nights. The first night we were kept waiting a very long time for our food. However, when it came it was worth waiting for. The waiter then apologised for our wait, told us it was because of a party, and gave us a free dessert. (which was also delicious). We enjoyed the meal so much we went back the next night. This time, we were kept waiting again. Also, I asked for my steak to be medium to well done and it came out red and dripping with blood, which I wasn't so happy about. The Skyy bar on the tenth floor was very nice and you have a good view of the surrounding area (which isn't very pretty, but looks good at night!). We were a bit hesitant about booking this hotel because it was out of town. However, it is only about 5 minutes walk to a tram (along a main road and past a building site) and then about a 10 minute journey into the centre of Amsterdam. This wasn't really a problem for us, but I wouldn't recommend it for elderly people or those who can't walk very far. I would recommend this hotel to other people and would choose to stay there again (as long as it didn't get too much more expensive) as it was very clean and modern and it was easy to get to the town or the airport from the hotel.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "Davina7", "ReviewID": "UR59976839", "Content": "My husband and I with another couple stayed a the Westcord last weekend for 3 nights.

We stayed the first leg of our trip at the Fashion Hotel and it was Awesome!! The rooms are big, clean, very modern, and the bathrooms are cool. The staff were all friendly, professional, and willing to assist. Even when we were less than sober and asked them where we could order a pizza from in the middle of the night!! They ordered us one :) I will admit I'm glad my friend and I booked seperate rooms because the bathrooms are designed to be cool/sexy/chic and the toilet in my room was private but the shower was surrounded by glass walls on each side. Since I stayed alone I didn't care, i thought it was cool. Unless you're staying with a significant other, you may want to request a room with a private shower. The bathroom was kept very clean with fun soaps and lotions in the shower. The Skyy bar on the 10th floor was really great. Friendly staff and excellent cocktails. Part of the ceiling is made of draped crystal. It's beautiful. The bartender was very talented, i felt like i was in Las Vegas. We got a snack at the hotel bar and the food was ok. I had a club sandwich. It hit the spot but we weren't really interested in eating there. The tram is a short walk (maybe 5 mins but i walk fast so it didn't even take that long) to get to the city center. This hotel is well worth the money to stay and I am admittedly hard to please. It was great and i had a blast at this hotel. Since I spent most of my spare time at the kyy bar I never used the pool, spa, or fitness center.

Yes there are teething problems but on the whole we loved the hotel and it made for a really relaxing break. The rooms are really comfortable- the beds are particularly huge and comfortable. Bathroom is lovely, with a seperate shower and deep bath. Yes there is a bit of an issue with the floor but if you dont have the shower on full its ok. All the usual extras were provided- toiletteries, tea and coffee, safe, tv, hairdryer. We didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on the food, although it was more pricey than going out into the city centre. Breakfast is 17.50 euros and meals were around 30. WE paid between 8 and 12 for breakfast in the city. Drinks semed expensive but on reflection, no more so than nice places in town. I guess the exchange rate is to blame rather than high prices. The Sky Bar is a must for a relaxing drink after trecking about all day. I can recommend the pool and treatments if you fancy a relax although be prepared to pay 10 Euros to use the sauna and steam room. They are also opeining it up to membership so be prepared for it to get busier. The gym isnt up to much although maybe its not finished. Transport to/from the airport is easy, as are trams. You can walk to the Leylaan station from the hotel- takes about 10 minutes. We had problems buying a ticket at Leylaan to the airport- there is a machine but it only takes coins. It wouldnt take our cards so we had to travel without a ticket. We bought a 72 hour tram ticket which was handy. Ride to town is about 20 minutes. There was a problem with the trams one night so we had to get a taxi back which cost about 10 euros. We found lots of places to eat and drink in the centre- either we were lucky or everywhere is a really high standard. Id really recommend the 1st class restaurant at the central station for a real step back in time- i promise you wont be disapointed.

However the value for money was just too good to ignore. A four star hotel which even before the price reduction was cheaper than most three star offerings was not to be missed. We needn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have worried. It turned out to be one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The hotel is superb. There are still minor things which are being sorted out. On one day all but one of the lifts were refusing to work, and some room facilities like the mini bar are still being installed. That said the rooms are spacious clean and comfortable. The TV system carries channels to please every nationality including a full range of BBC options. The bed is huge and comfortable, the bathroom spacious and well appointed. It gets better. On the top floor there is a superb cocktail bar. (Ask Michael, the bar manager, to make you one of his specials. They are divine.) Meanwhile downstairs the hotel has a restaurant which can compete favourably with many of the best in Amsterdam. Venture into the sub basement and you will find a well appointed gym and a heated swimming pool which is maintained at a most agreeable temperature. It was this above all which caught our eye as we have our own pool at home and like to swim every night. The hotel keeps theirs at a pleasant temperature in the high eighties and the chlorine levels are not too high either. Our stay was made all the better by the attentiveness of the staff and their friendly and helpful advice on everything from places to see to how to get around. The hotel is located on the 1 and 17 tram routes about equidistant from Surinam-Plein and Lelylaan. We traveled to Holland by Eurostar and train. If you do the same it worth knowing that the ticket you buy, which takes you to Amsterdam central station, also entitles you to change trains at Amsterdam Schipol. If you do this then you can pick up from there, at no extra cost, a train which takes you direct to Lelylaan station - just one stop! From there it is less than five minutes walk to the hotel. To get from the station to the hotel follow the cycle path through the housing estate turning right onto delftandlaan. Walk approximately 50 yards to the roundabout and cross the road heading west on schipluidenlaan cycleway which goes under the motorway. The track veers round to the left as it emerges from under the motorway. Continue for a further 150 yards until you are just about to go under the roadway for Cornelius Lelylaan. The Fashion Hotel is now directly on your right.

I was really pleased with the price although a little concerned once I had read a few reviews before I arrived. Having travelled with just a friend it was a bit concerning initially that the bathroom has a clear door, (what is that about???) However we soon figured out that if we left the shower running for a while before getting in then the door steams up anyway saving your dignity. We didnt have any trouble with the bathroom flooding as many have stated on their reviews. As we live in the army barracks in Germany we arrived by train to central station so had to ask for directions to the hotel, we were told to get tram 1 or 17 to karrenstraat (not sure if this is the correct spelling) but in actual fact it is much easier to get off at the stop before which is surienemplan (again spelling is probably incorrect) just walk up the road on the left hand side it is much more convenient. We really went for a girlie weekend, as the hotel is out of the city centre and the last tram returns to the hotel around 12.30pm late nights were really out of the question which we were a bit gutted about. A few reviews I read have said the taxis are really expensive but if you get the hotel to prebook you one it was only around 13euros from Leidseplan and it only cost us 20 euros back to central station. Which considering prices in Leeds I didn't think this was bad at all. It is definately worth investing in a tram pass from the hotel, we paid 18euros each for a 4 day pass. Overall I would stay in this hotel again although next year I probably won't be able to afford to as the prices will probably be too high! Oh one final point, if you are going on a girlie weekend don't bother going to the ice bar, yes it is a bar made of ice but believe me the novelty quickly wears off once you're in and you're not allowed to take your own photos and the two drinks they offer is really only one cocktail of pure cheap vodka and cheap juice!

We arrived at Amsterdam Schipol Airport and visited the Tourist Information Centre as my husband and I needed the cheapiest options available for sisghtseeing and traveliing within the city. We purchased a 48 hour I AMSTERDAM card included all travel within the city but (not the train from Schipol Airport to Leyliaan this was under 3 Euro's per person), gave us free entrance to loads of museums including the Van Gogh Museum, free hour canal cruise with Holland International, 25% off various attractions and restuarants, it also had a number of pages that consisted off vouchers to use in and around Amsterdam. The cost of this pass is 48 Euro's per person and is definetly value for money, otherwise you will get ripped off paying on the trams and buses all day. You can purchase 24/72 passes too depending on how long you are staying. It is really easy to get from the airport, you need to catch the train from Amsterdam Schipol Airport to Leylaan which is about 6 minute ride on the train. From Leylaan you can catch tram number 1 or 17 and get off the stop called SURINAMEPLEIN if you get off the stop before like we did then its a pain to find as you have to go under some subway/tunnel and its not very nice so I can agree with some of the reviews previously on this. If you get off at Surinameplein its the best option as its on the main road and you walk 2 minutes towards the hotel and remember to check your metro cards IN and OUT at the sensors when you get off the tram otherwise your travel pass becomes INVALID! We checked in at the hotel and it was really modern, the staff were polite and helped out where they could. The room that we were booked in was very clean and the beds were made up each day. You have a modern Plasma, tea/coffee facilities, mini bar, iron, ironing board, hairdryer so its all modern and the decor was fantastic. The bed was huge and comfotable too. The bathroom had great decor but be aware if you are travelling with family and you need privacy the bathroom door is see through so not ideal for some people! The swimming pool was lovely and clean and hardly anybody there, they have sunbeds to relax on and also a steam room and sauna room for relaxtion. Towels are provided when you get to the swimming area. If you are staying at this hotel then I recommend you have a dip in the pool. Getting to the city centre is really easy too, you just need to walk on the main road again to the metro stop and catch tram 1 or 17...... Overall I would say this hotel is fantastic, the location is good as I went with my husband but If I went with another female then I would have booked something in the city centre to avoid walking that 2 minute walk along the main road. .... I definetly got my money's worth out of it.... and just before I finish the prices of the food and drink in the hotel is really really expenisve.... for example breakfast was 18 euro's per person which is around \u00c2\u00a317-18 in english pounds.... we just got the tram and went to the city centre and ate at the pancake cafes which did really good food for a decent price!", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "County Durham, England", "Title": "\u201cA lovely hotel, though not quite ready\u201d", "Author": "Phil_Murray88", "ReviewID": "UR44366713", "Content": "We stayed at the Fashion Hotel, Amsterdam for five nights at the end of September 2009. Our total stay cost some \u00c2\u00a3315, following an excellent deal from a last-minute travel website. For the price we paid, the hotel was absolutely brilliant. The rooms are beautifully furnished and very spacey. The television has an excellent range of BBC channels, and is very big. The bathroom has a great shower, and we didn't have the problems previously reported about it flooding the entire bathroom (though the room is a wetroom, and thus suffers from typical wetroom 'wetness'). The bed is AMAZING! We had a standard room, and were given a king size bed with very comfortable linen, etc. Great! The facilities in the hotel are also great. When we stayed, the sauna/steamroom/etc. were free to use, along with the nicely sized swimming pool. Using such facilities after a long day in town was a great treat, and made for an excellent holiday. The SKYY Bar is also brilliant, with great views at night. The service in the bar was excellent (served at table, by waiter), and the prices weren't too bad, with very reasonably priced house wine by the glass. Also, the staff at reception are very good and incredibly informative. As for the location, I didn't find this to be too much of a problem. The tram is about five minutes away by foot, and then takes some 15 minutes to get to the town centre proper. I didn't find this arduous at all. Some quibbles: First, some of the furniture in the room was surprisingly shabby, bearing in mind the age of the hotel. A button was missing on the great leather recliner in the room. Also, the paint on the dresser was chipped in places. This is unforgiveable; the hotel is brand new! More seriously, the minibar. Unlike most reviewers, our minibar had been installed. We wish it had not been. The front of the minibar has very very bright lights that cannot be switched off. They filled the room with an eerie blue light on a night. If we had not fashioned some ad hoc cover from the bed's throw, sleeping would have been difficult. Thirdly, the landscaping outside the hotel is far from complete. Building work is everywhere. Though not noisy, it does make the hotel feel less classy. Especially the mass of unswept building dust on the stairs up to the hotel. Finally, the steam room stopped working on the final two evenings we stayed at the hotel. It was not fixed, nor did there seem to be any awareness of the problem. This put a damper on our last night. After cycling 45km in the Dutch countryside, a steam was greatly appealing! All in all, this is a great hotel. If you're going to be paying full price, I'd look somewhere else. The hotel, in six months or so, will be excellent. At the minute, however, it's not quite ready. Hence my giving it three rather than four stars. If you can get a cheap deal, though, then stay here.

The room we were allocated was on the second floor and was lovely it was big and especially liked the bathroom and modern interior. We had breakfast which was nice with a choice of pastries, cereals, fruit, toast or a cooked breakfast. The location of the hotel was easy to find don't take a taxi as we took a bus from outside the Schipol Plaza that dropped us off at Station Lelyaan which was only a few minutes walk to the hotel. We bought a metro pass from the hotel which cost 15 euros each for 3 days which we found to be very good value. The trip to the centre is a tram ride away and the stop is a five minute walk under the bridge. People are kind and friendly and always ready to help. The weather was good which enabled us to enjoy all the wonderful sites. Would certainly recommend this hotel.

We stayed at the end of July/early Aug for 3 nights. There were still a few teething problems, but all easily solved and staff helpful if we needed something. Great leisure facilities with a pool, steam room and saunas and in working order and great after a day of lots of walking. The spa treatments were not open yet when we visited but was due to open a couple of days later. Bar was good (but expensive as all hotels tend to be) and the Skybar was not yet open. Bar staff very friendly and helpful and the mojitos were excellent! The hotel was not in the centre (but halfway to airport). The tram number 1 stops about 7 minutes walk from the hotel at Suriname Plein and it is about 6 or 7 stops to the central area of Leidseplein. Trams are very frequent. We bought a 3 day pass with at the hotel reception for 15 Euro. Tram 17 also goes from Suriname plein to the central station. The rooms were spacious, clean and brand new. The mini bar were not installed yet but hotel gave us a free drink in the bar to compensate. There was a safe, iron, tea/coffee making facilities and huge shower room. Nice big and clean bed, flat screen TV and free wireless internet connection. All was working as it should. Food was expensive in hotel . Around Suriname plein there were two nice cafes for reasonably priced breakfast or lunch, or just take the tram towards the town centre. We took a taxi from airport to the hotel at the cost of 33 euro, so taxis not cheap. Taxi driver could not find it easily, so just tell them it is close to Suriname plein. You can instead take a train from the aiport to the nearerst train station which is Lelylaan, about 7 minutes walk to the hotel and cost about 4 euro per person.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cStunning property with the WOW factor\u201d", "Author": "cutecats", "ReviewID": "UR36879097", "Content": "I booked the Golden Tulip Amsterdam Fashion in March 09 months before it was due to open and when the hotel first opened I saw 2 reviews on here that made me nervous that the hotel was still a building site and rooms were only half ready so I contacted the hotel expressing my concerns and was put at ease so I would recommend anyone who has worries email the hotel direct. When my partner and I arrived on the 31st July 09 for our 3 night stay the only things that werent ready were the sun beds, mini bars and the SKYY bar (sun beds and mini bar were of no concern to us and we both got a free drink as the mini bar wasn't ready) - we would have liked to have seen the view from the SKYY bar. I agree with other comments about the hotel being hard to find simply because no one has heard of it! We booked the shuttle bus and 2 of the staff there hadnt heard of the property, it would actually work out better to take a taxi from Schipol airport to the hotel as it is around the same cost (45 euro for a shuttle return for 2 adults as opposed to around 50 euro for a return ride in the taxi). The hotel, yes from the outside still is a building site however this did not ruin anything at all for us, the tram stop isn't directly outside the hotel as the website claims but is only a very short walk away (when you get off the tram returning back to the hotel there isn't a pavement to walk on so you have to cross the road and go back under the subway to get back). Take tram 1 or 17 to Central Station and when coming back from a night out take the same trams back to Osdorp (think thats correct!) - note tram 1 goes via Leidesplein which is fantastic. A 48 hour tram pass can be bought at the hotel reception for 11.50 per person (a single tram ride valid for 1 hour is 2.60). Again agreeing with other comments, the bathroom does leak when you take a shower but I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. I myself work for a UK hotel group so have very high standards when I am staying at a competitors hotel paying full rates. The hotel is modern and chic, we recieved good service and had one of the best breakfasts I have ever tasted at a hotel. The leisure facilities are fantastic although be warned the swimming pool is very cold!! The beds were so comfortable and the first floor has 2 computers with free internet access, useful for checking up last minute addresses of places to visit.

Not registered at Tourist Information and the street name is not registered yet either! You need to know its on Nachtwachtstraat. It is out of the city limits and is 30 mins on a tram. We were advised to get off Tram 1 or 17, at Derkinderstr,. We had to carry our cases down some steep stone steps which came out under a bridge, we then had to fathom our way to the hotel. Tip! Turn right, tuen left at the roundabout and under the motorway bridge, keep left and its on your right after the building site. Beware, we were watched from between the bridges! There are then lots of steep stone steps to climb to reception too. Tip! Go in the office/spa entrance on road level and there are a bank of elevators to Reception floor. The hotel Receptionist didn't like it when we complained about the false accusation of a tram outside. She directed us to Suriname which is a good 10mins walk which involves walking on the main road as there is no pavement due to the building site! On a plus, its a fabulous hotel, clean, luxurious, especially for the price. There is tea and coffee making facilities, large screen tv, iron and ironing board. There are also two computers in a shared area on Floor 1, which can be used free of charge. However, the shower does not drain quick enough and the water soon spreads across the floor into the basin area and there is nothing to stop it flowing out of the bathroom and into the bedroom area. The Skybar wasn't open as is not finished yet and there are no mini-bars in the rooms.

The hotel website had quite a few fibs on it. For example it says there is a tram stop outside (no there isn't, it is 10 mins walk away, Surinamplein on routes 1 and 17 from Central Station) and that it is a 5 min walk from Lelylaan station (even if it was properly sign-posted and had signs on the outside of the building it would take at least 10 mins). There was no landscaping at all and from the access road there were only dusty boards to walk over with your case. I dread to think what it would have been like if it had rained. Once we found reception (everything was covered in a layer of dust) the staff were trying their best, but it was obviously a struggle. We were told that only rooms on the first floor were ready but all were occupied so we would have to return a few hours later and our room should be ready. It was also clear that the leisure facilities/spa area weren't ready either; this was one of the reasons we had selected the hotel in the first place, so we were disappointed. It wasn't worth the wait - there was a huge wet area in the middle of the carpet - we discovered the source of this when we turned on the aircon and water poured out. It was at this stage we found the phones didn't work either (great in an emergency???) so we decided enough was enough and returned to reception to complain and ask to be moved to another hotel in the chain. The general manager came out after a few minutes to apologise - he had already booked us into the Arts Hotel and arranged and paid for a taxi to take us there - so we had no complaints with the staff really. I am certain that once complete it will be a gorgeous hotel, but if you are thinking of staying there I would check with the hotel to see how building work has progressed first.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "WestCord Fashion Hotel Amsterdam", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1382766-Reviews-WestCord_Fashion_Hotel_Amsterdam-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$119 - $260*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Hendrikje Stoffelstraat 1</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1058 GC</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1382766", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2e/12/b1/swimming-pool-fashion.jpg"}}
