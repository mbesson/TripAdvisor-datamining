{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Ideal location A very spacious apartment in a great location. We had a 2 night stay so didn't want to be too far from the main attractions. The holocaust memorial ,Brandenburg gate and Reichstag were all within a 10 minute walk and the U-Bahn was 400m from the apartment. The room was well equipped and also seemed quiet when we were there. The shower wasn't the greatest but it did the job! My biggest concern was that we arrived late in the evening and the reception shut at 6pm. It was arranged to leave the key at the nearby Italian restaurant which shut at 11pm. we arrived at 11.15 but luckily there were still people eating in the restaurant so it was still open, but i don't know where we would have ended up otherwise! There is a nice little cafe nearby which does a decent breakfast and also a steak bar, italian, a vietnamese which was very good and a chinese which wasn't so good!I would recommend these apartments for their location, cleanliness and value for money.", "Date": "Oct 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR307059132", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hergest"}, {"Content": "Spartan and spacious       Brandenburger Gate", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR290476093", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "UWHusky1968"}, {"Content": "Great Value and Location!

The receptionist was pleasant when we checked in (the reception is based in a separate block round the corner on Behrenstr.) and offered to let us leave our bags there if necessary when we left. Our flat was on the 6th or 7th floor and consisted of one room with a desk and bookcase, one double bedroom, a bathroom, spacious lounge/diner and kitchen. The windows were large and the decor white/minimalist making it seem very light and airy. On the ground floor of our particular block was a veggie restaurant and the supermarket is about a five minute walk further down Wilhelmstr. so shopping for food isn`t a problem. A couple of caveats are that visitors should be prepared for the rather anonymous entrance hall/stairwell and that some might find the bathrooms a bit smaller than they are used to. The lift only went as far as the floor below in our case so check this out when booking if it is likely to be a problem.Overall if you like DIY accommodation and think `practical` rather than `luxury` then we think these apartments represent good value, especially when you take into account where they are situated. We`d already started to feel quite at home even though only there for a couple of days.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR485468001", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "piccallili"}, {"Content": "Perfect location!!

We had a two bedroomed apartment - bedrooms very spacious as was the living/dining room. Kitchen was well equipped with dishwasher. Only downside was no microwave. Bathroom was small but clean and functional and always loads of hot water. The location really can't be beaten - literally a few hundred metres from the Brandenburg Gate and basically next door to the Adlon which probably would have cost the same for a night as we paid for a week! Being so close to the Tiergarten was a real plus for me as it was great to have a fantastic safe place to go for a run. We were able to walk very easily to all the main city centre sites and didn't need to use public transport other than for the journey to and from Schoenefeld airport which was very straightforward - Airport Express to Friedrichstrasse and change to S Bahn for one stop to Unter den Linden and then literally 100-200 metres to the apartment. Good choice of cheap restaurants on Wilhelmstrasse and v good supermarket just further along the road. All in all a great find and would go again like a shot.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR643249028", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "janny1"}, {"Content": "Great Location       Bathroom", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR751103447", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DJMLondon"}, {"Content": "Fantastic on all counts We (2 couples in our early 40's) have just returned from Berlin.

You cannot be more centrally located for this amount of money. The good thing is that the area is quiet but only one block away from Unter der Linden and the Brandenburger Tor.The appartment has a living room, dining area, kitchen, bathroom, 2 bed rooms, dishwasher and washing machine. Amazingly enough there is no microwave. Bed linen and towels are provided.The only disadvantage is that there is no internet. Make sure that you book a cable modem in advance if you need it (there was no modem available anymore when we checked in). An internet cafe can be found around the corner. You can park your car for only 35 EUR a full week.The appartments are located in a so-called ''Platten Bau'' appartment block, which are the characteristic housing buildings built everywhere in the former DDR. You have to realize that the appartment housed a family of 4 before the Berlin wall came down! I have been several times in Berlin, but this was the best value for money I have ever had there. Highly recommended if self catering is an option for you.

The apartments have living rooms, dining areas, kitchen, bathroom, and - a washing machine! Ours looked out on the chestnut-lined Kaiser Willhelmstrasse, less than a block from the British Embassy. There are at least 6 good restaurants in the same block (German, Vietnamese, Italian, Chinese, a steak house, etc). Less than 2 blocks from the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden, shopping, etc. We only took the U-Bahn once - walked everywhere. The apartments are spread over several blocks but they don't feel like an apartment complex - the street level is all shops, restaurants, and businesses. A nice neighborhood - lots of embassies in the area. There's a big supermarket (HIT) just a few blocks away. Check-in was a snap. We booked directly with the management and they were a pleasure to deal with. When I asked about internet access, they came over within a couple of hours and installed a cable modem for just E3 per day - beast deal of all the places we stayed. Since we're light packers, we really appreciated having a washing machine (tiny though it was). Kitchen has an electric range with a convection oven, toaster, coffee-maker, pans, dishes and utensils. Excellent, virtually sound-proof windows - you can open them and they're about 8 thick. Modern furnishings - everything we touched was from IKEA. Would work for a family or 2 couples. There's a E50 cleaning fee so it's a better bargain for a longer stay (we paid E100 per night - can't find many hotels for that in Berlin, especially for 2 rooms).", "Date": "May 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR516297303", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gejbooks"}, {"Content": "Def recommend this one I stayed here over NYE for 4 days with my partner and thought the appartment was great. We weren't expecting a 2 bedroom huge flat, with separate kitchen, so were very pleasantly suprised!The appt was exceptionally clean, bright, modern, and the kitchen was kitted out with everything you need. It was double glazed and I never heard anyone above or below us; nice solid thick walls!The only small downsides were that it was a little cold (even with the central heating turned right up) and all the duvets were singles, rather than a double. Having said that I would recommend this to all, esp families and people who like self catering. It is an interesting area to stay - lots of local sights and a good base.
