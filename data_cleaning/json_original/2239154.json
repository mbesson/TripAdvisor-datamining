Don't expect 5 star service or equipments, it's really a boutique hotel in a great location - If you don't mind overlooking the U Bahn - Local train tracks are right outside the hotel. It's not a loud traffic & strangely does not look so ugly in Berlin. The gym is really only 3 cardio machines with mirrors on a wall & the dry sauna is very small but the staff makes up for it. The only thing that bugged me slightly is when I called to get the internet access codes, I was asked to come down physically to the Front Desk when it could have been given to me over the phone? Point was? Else was good - Relaxing stay, good bar, friendly staff, fresh feel as brand new.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cGreat new hotel\u201d", "Author": "caroline456", "ReviewID": "UR120089259", "Content": "Great location, very clean and modern.

At arrival we were told that abba berlin had already given our room to someone else and that we would be moved to the ottello hotel. We were exactly unhappy, because the abba hotel was overcrowded with tour groups and the receptionists were rather unprofessional. Arriving at the ottello, the impressions was rather positive. The reception desk staff was very friendly and professional. They walked us up to the room. The rooms were brand new, nice and comfortable. Not very big. Standard 4 Star affair. The breakfast buffet selection was not great, but of good quality and good enough. The location was probably even better than the location of abba berlin, as the ottello is close to the Kantstrasse with all its restaurants. All in all, the hotel was good, the staff was even better. One thing, when you book, try to get a room away facing away from the city train.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "H'Otello K'80", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d2239154-Reviews-H_Otello_K_80-Berlin.html", "Price": "$105 - $173*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Knesebeckstrasse 80</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10623</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2239154", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4a/63/7c/getlstd-property-photo.jpg"}}
