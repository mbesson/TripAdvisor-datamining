Extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Resident cat a little skittish at times, but that was probably more to do with the renovations that began while we were there! (They're currently installing new security cameras in the hallways and upgrading the electrical wiring - so probably best to ring them and check when these are due to finish if you sleep light or are likely to want to sleep during local work hours). The sleep quality was great, and when my husband pointed out the toilet seat in our bathroom was cracked the staff got it fixed as soon as it was possible (we arrived late on Sunday, so it had to wait till Monday morning). The bathroom overall was very compact but well designed. Room safes could be a little bigger; they are the older type that can't fit laptops, although they would probably take an iPad. Staff were able to navigate us through the many Japanese eateries in the area to one that was really good, and they also helped us find a local cinema playing the movie we wanted to watch in English and work out what times it was showing. Breakfast was a good selection of yogurt, fruit, hams, pre-packed individual cheeses, very good local breads, and excellent pastries (although it is Paris so it's difficult to go wrong there!). The location was perfect for us. We could wander to most of the major sites from the hotel, and did so. L'ile du Nord is a leisurely 20 minute meander away. The Odeon is just down the end of the street. Sorbonne University is just around the corner so there are lots of eateries and bookshops aimed at students. There are many Japanese restaurants up and down the street the hotel is on, and if you have been travelling a while there is a self-service laundry directly opposite the hotel. Those with mobility problems need to take into account that the stairs are uneven and that in keeping with most of Paris there is only one tiny lift that was probably shoe-horned into an old service lift; it most definitely wouldn't take a mobility scooter for example.

We didn't have the hotel breakfast priced at 13 Euros but chose to use the local cafes and shops instead...... The situation of the hotel, in the Luxembourg/Latin area, was just right for us. There are cafes, restaurants, shops and markets all close by. It is very convenient for the metro and buses and is only ten minutes walk to the city centre and the banks of the Seine.

They were also helpful with a map showing their location and sights to see. I think the only downfall of the hotel was the elevator. So happy they had one since we were on the top floor but it is only big enough to fit two people if your bags were large as ours were. Four people could fit but it would be very intimate. We always walked down the stairs to let others use the lift.

Since I have recently been widowed, my son thought it was about time I realized my ambition and booked a room for us at the St Paul Rive Gauche. I had spent some time researching the various hotels listed in Trip Advisor, and this hotel was chosen because of the accommodation available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a ground floor room with a spiral staircase leading to an upper room, the shower room being on the upper level. The shower room had everything one could need and was of a superior standard. It was spotlessly clean, as was the room, on both levels. I cannot speak too highly of our choice. We both found it absolutely excellent in every way. The accommodation was spacious and overlooking a very attractive patio, and the staff, both day and night staff, all extremely friendly and helpful with special thanks to Blandine, whose friendly attitude when booking, helped to clinch our choice. The flat screen TV and the small safe and mini-bar were very useful and we appreciated the use of the Internet. The room was very quiet at night, since the windows on both levels overlooked the internal patio, and not the street. The hotel cat, Skype, also was a great plus point. He needed little encouragement to spend a lot of time in our room, since it was on the ground floor and he was able to get in and out of the window into the patio, and is extremely playful. The location is very good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were able to walk to a lot of the places we wanted to see and also felt quite safe when coming back late at night. We were spoilt for choice regarding places to eat for lunch and dinner. We had the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s included breakfast, taken in the very attractive breakfast room, and it was very good and plentiful. We both loved it.

We had the hardest time choosing a hotel in Paris. We wanted something close to the sights and in either the latin quarter of saint germaine area. Well this hotel sits just north east of Luxembourg Gardens and right in between both of those arrondisments (the 5th and 6th). I'm glad we picked it. To start off - the rates are reasonable. Paris is expensive and so was this hotel... but by booking early with the hotel we saved a LOT of money. They have great deals on their own website and I highly recommend booking through the hotel for better deals than you'll find on a third party booking site. The mini bar was nice - we stored our drinks and snacks in it. The internet worked well all except the morning we left when it got spotty. And we were on the 5th floor and that was pretty good for it to be so fast! There is also a hotel computer to use if you need it. We had a superior room and it was worth it for the extra space. It was on the 5th floor and faced the street. Amazingly quiet. The back of the hotel is a private school (a very famous school with graduates wining nobel prizes and some buried in the pantheon - also nearby). So it's a quiet place. The noisiest experience for us was the family occupying 2 rooms in the suite next to us who's children would run around slamming doors and knock on our door by mistake waking us up. I think they spent more time in the hotel than out enjoying Paris... but thankfully we only had to deal with their noise in the early evenings before we went out! No noise at night waking us up! The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is spacious. Very modern. Nice amenities. We loved how they have an \"eco\" card explaining guests may re-use towels to save on energy. We don't use new towels each day at home and we are conservationists as much as we can be... so I always love seeing those cards to remind people to save energy if they choose to by reusing their towels! If not - they will bring you fresh ones daily. There was a large wardrobe in the room big enough for suitcases and clothes. A small room safe which worked but not big enough for iPad or a laptop computer. The staff are very nice and will help with anything. We didn't feel like restaurant reservations were needed in Paris if you got to a place by 8PM. Do try nearby Le Petit Prince for dinner. It's amazingly delicious french food and reasonable costs. The metro is nearby as is the RER to CDG airport and RER to Versailles. We did not have the breakfast as we thought it was too expensive at 13 euro... but we found plenty of places and cafes all around Saint Michele area and even at the end of the hotel street near Saint Michele was a delightful Crepe place to get a breakfast crepe and coffee or croissant. Very cheap. This hotel was superb in every way and we could find no faults here. The nit-picky reviewers are a bit ridiculous sometimes and out of touch. It's hard to find a major fault here.

We used the internet which was spotty at times, but overall worked fine. The hotel was clean, staff very polite and quite. The breakfast was fairly decent (hard boiled eggs, pastries, yogurt, meats). The fruit was cut up in a bowl and would have preferred whole fruit or not in a bowl of juice. I got a banana from the little market next door and brought that with me to breakfast. We were happy to have breakfast available instead of having to find a place (although it would have probably been easy). The hotel is close to the train (we took the train from the airport) and is within walking distance to many sites (Notre Dame is about 15 minutes away). If you are a runner, this is the place to go. The Luxumbourg Park is 5 minutes away and the loop inside is about a mile and a quarter. It was perfect, beautiful and a wonderful way to start the day. We went every morning. There are a few places to eat on the street but many of them are Japanese run by Chinese (not overly authentic), there are places along the main street which is not far away. We got some sandwiches and salad and went to Luxembourg Park for a picnic - highly recommended.

This was my 8th visit to Paris in 21 years and this was unquestionably the best hotel I've ever stayed at. I had read many excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and they all proved to be quite accurate. I knew enough about the neighborhood that I definitely wanted to stay close to the Luxembourg Gardens. Besides the area being so pleasant and attractive, it is an easy location to get to from de Gaulle airport via the RER, thus avoiding the high cost of a taxi. The location is superb - close to so much of what one comes to see and do in Paris and yet the hotel is on a reasonably quiet, narrow one-way street. I had requested a specific room that I saw on the hotel's website and the room was ready for us when we arrived, even though we arrived 2 hours before the posted 3 PM check-in time. Even though the room faced the street, the double pane windows did an excellent job blocking any street noise. The room was attractive, small by American standards, but quite comfortable and promptly refreshed each morning. The bathroom was surprisingly large and had been gorgeously updated. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well each evening. We had breakfast every morning in the charming dining area in the lower level - the reservation we made included breakfast. Besides the excellent traditional French items - (coffee, croissants, pain au chocolat, French bread) there was fresh juice, cheese, meats, fruit salad, and cereal. Our service was excellent and we were given an extra pot of coffee each time we requested it, which was a real treat for 2 serious coffee drinkers. I know we would have spent significantly more for a less filling meal elsewhere. The hotel staff were extremely professional, friendly and very helpful. They also all spoke excellent English. While I studied French in both high school and college and do my best to speak the language, my spoken French is fairly limited. I was in France after all so I strongly believed I had an obligation to at least try to communicate in the native language. A pet peeve of mine is the rude expectation of so many Americans that everyone else should speak English - such an arrogant & obnoxious attitude!!! Free Wi-Fi was also a nice feature, although it was a bit slow. There also is a computer in the lobby which can be used at no charge. And the laundromat directly across the street from the hotel was a nice bonus as well.

I firmly believe that one of the main reasons our trip was so fabulous was because of the location and quality of this hotel! Ok, its not a 5 star, its not like over the top, with huge rooms and bathrooms. But it is absolutely perfect for what we wanted. We were not in the room during the day as we were out sightseeing non stop. But every day around 5pm we would return to our hotel, change, and head out to the cafes and restaurants in the Latin Qtr/Left Bank - all in walking distance of this hotel. We didn't hang out in any other part of town because THIS PART of town has it all! Odeon metro is super close to the hotel. The area doesn't have a touristy feel, its all locals, every restaurant and cafe packed every night! This is just a great part of town. There are also local attractions really close that are not to be missed: St Sulpice (great shopping over there too), Pantheon, Sorbonne area, and Luxembourg Gardens. The Gardens were BEYOND gorgeous and one day when we were tired of sightseeing we got a bottle of wine and sat in Luxembourg Gardens people watching. It was the best day! There is also a great little bar near the hotel called La Pinte. Its great! The cafe life is fabulous along rue St Germain! Les Editors is fun, we also ate at Marco Polo which was tasty italian. As for the hotel itself, the room was very clean. The internet access was a bit slow but always worked. I know people complained about it but we didn't have a problem as we were only checking email and news. The bathroom was small, and the floor got soaked when you took a shower but that is standard for european hotels! The bed was comfy and every night was quiet. The other hotel guests appeared to be middle age couples. Everyone was exhausted from the day I'm sure! I got the breakfast included cause I need my coffee. The breakfast was in the basement and was basically coffee/tea, croisants, bread, yogurt, etc. Just enough to get you going. I really appreciated that! You can also walk to the Louvre, Notre Dame, Rodin, and even the Eiffel Tour if the weather is nice. My one word of advice is to get a laminated hand held map of Paris it saved us when we were walking around! This hotel was absolutely perfect and made our trip all the better. Paris is amazing!

The location is fabulous...restaurants, bars, clothing shopping, bookstores, and street cafes are all within a few steps to five short blocks away. Historic landmarks such as the Notre Dame Cathedral, the Pantheon, the Sorbonne, Le Jardin de Luxembourg, and the Seine and Louvre are all within easy walking distance. Monoprix is about a block away for chips, almond-stuffed olives, pistachios, and bordeaux for those lovely late afternoon breaks in the room before heading out to dinner. The Metro is 3 to 5 minutes away, depending on which station you head for. And finally, there is Monsieur Sputnik, the 16 year old cat who, like his name, makes sure he orbits from person to person to give them that homey feeling only provided by a cat with an attitude. We were all concerned when he came home from the vet with a blue bandage wrapped tightly around his skinny paw and he gladly accepted our cooing and lamenting words.

It was my fourth trip but first for my husband. He was very excited about this because it was kind of our wedding anniversary too, PARIS :) I originally booked the hotel for 3 nights because we were not sure if we want to stay the whole time in Paris, we were thinking about visiting London too. I did get the room from their website as the last minute deal, so price was reasonable but for us, WIFI was a big deal. We wanted a room with internet access because we wanted to plan everything for our following day; also my husband had to check his emails frequently because of his business. Hotel advertises WIFI but don't believe that. I read in one of the reviews the WIFI doesn't work but after that the manager replied that it was just a temporary problem. Every time we told them about internet they came up with: 1- Oh, sorry, it is because you are using IPAD? Dauh? Why should that be different from a laptop? 2-Sorry, it just happened today, I am going to call the internet provider right now (and she starts looking at some number to show you she really wants to call!) 3- Oh, we never had this problem before, I guess this is the whole neighborhood; we all have this problem today!! C\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mon, we are coming from North America, we know what is internet! Just tell us it is not working and end all these games instead of wasting our time by trying 3 different user name/ pass words or shutting down at 2 AM in the morning! And finally the guy in reception told me their internet provider is a cheap one and some of the rooms don't have any internet access, end of the story! I upgraded our room on the fourth night to a bigger room just to try the internet and told the lady at the front desk, I am not sure how many days I want to stay. She said, No problem, I will put a note in your file which states customer can stay till further notice and I happily signed that. She was in heaven when I upgraded my room since I was paying more and her rooms were empty (Tuesday night). Room was in 4th floor, but as expected the elevator was not working but internet was working!! On Thursday morning, when we dropped our key, the other receptionist told us, you have to leave today because your room is booked! Imagine, you are in vacation and leaving to enjoy your day and they just decide to ask you to leave because it is Thursday and they could rent their room! She was very rude and we were shocked by her attitude. Then after she said, I can put you in another room but for sure your room is booked for Friday and Saturday because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reserve the room for you! They filled their empty room with us and as soon as their room was booked probably with higher rates, they told us to leave and even didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the courtesy to give us a call a day before and ask us if we want to stay or not! I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stay one more min there, therefore I started to search for hotels and you know how frustrating that is while you are on vacation but thank God, that is Paris and it is full of hotels! On our way out, she told me she is sorry ( don't know for what though) while my poor husband was carrying our suitcases from the 4th floor because as usual the elevator was broken, the elevator she told me in the morning will work if I wait 2 min! I found the Best Western 5 min from this hotel and got a beautiful room, double sided window, fast internet with elevator working all the time + break fast, free non alcoholic drinks, welcome champagne and cheese, salad and bread every afternoon just for 10 Euro more, so if you are looking for challenge, go to this hotel but if you want a relaxing vacation with some customer service, this is not a place for you. I hope the manager of this hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reply me. He/she has a tendency to come up with some excuses and convince people all these were temporary problems!

A mini bar and safe are also provided. \u00c2\u00a0 On this visit we discovered two things worth sharing with other guests Firstly, never visit Versailles on a Sunday in July unless you like crowds and also don't try to see everything in one visit. Book ahead by internet and save yourself a long wait in the ticket queue at Versailles. Hotel Saint Paul has broadband and internet connection and you can print the tickets before you go. Secondly, my wife and I discovered the simple and inexpensive pleasure of taking a picnic down to the bank of the Seine on a warm summer evening and just chilling out in the company of other Parisians all doing the same thing, listening to buskers and the babble of conversations well into the early hours - so civilized A word of warning though, on our first jaunt to the river we took a bottle of champagne to celebrate in style however I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it as the 15 minute walk from the hotel is enough to turn your bottle of champagne into a lethal weapon. When we popped the cork we nearly killed two students and worse than that, we lost half the bubbly over the quay. So make it wine and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget a corkscrew, the French aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t big on screw tops. \u00c2\u00a0 Finally, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location on the Left Bank is very convenient; just 20 to 30 minutes by Metro from Gare Du Nor (line 4 to Odeon then a short walk). 15 minutes to the Luxembourg Gardens or Notre Dame it enjoys being pretty near to everything and still away from too much bustle. I thought it was also very nice of Hotel Saint Paul to ask Woody Allen to film in Rue Monsieur le Prince during our vacation; it was quite good fun to watch Woody Allen, Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard working on their next film - Midnight in Paris. The location was the Polidor, a typical traditional style French restaurant just a few yards from the hotel. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten there on a previous occasion and I can recommend it.

We booked it because they had a \"family\" room available, advertised as sleeping four. Unlike all the other rooms in the hotel it was not on sale and could only be booked at full price. However family rooms are sufficiently rare in Paris that we booked it anyway. It was a tiny space under the roof with a double bed and a single bed, with a trundle bed under the single bed. Unfortunately there was no room to actually pull out the trundle bed and also walk between the beds. However, when in Europe.... My real complaint was the rudness of the staff. Our room was supplied with only three pillows - none for the trundle bed. When we asked for a forth the response was \"I am not certain we have any\". They did eventually find one. We left the room early in the morning and returned about 3 p.m. It was not made up. The maid let herself into the room about 3:10 without knocking. I told her we were going out again in 20 minutes. She said no, that she had to clean it now because she was at the end of her shift and walked in and proceeded, with much angry huffing, to clean the room. We just sat there with our mouths open.

Most hotels were not originally built as hotels, they have been converted from existing buildings many of which are 200+ years old. Obviously they try to create a many rooms as possible so things can get cramped. Most rooms are going to be smaller than your average Holiday Inn in the US. There are hotels that were actually built as hotels, and they have comparable rooms, but in most cases your going to spend 300+ \u00e2\u201a\u00ac a night to stay there. I only mention this because I see a lot of people complaining about room size in reviews, in the US even a $45 motel room tends to be larger than than 150 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac room in Europe, but again, that's because motels were built as motels. Having said all that, my wife and I found our room at the Hotel St. Paul in Paris to quite spacious, not as big as a US motel room, but not tiny or cramped by any means. The bathroom was a normal size, not large, tub/shower combination, built in hair dryer was nice. We once spent a night at a London hotel with a shower so small my wife literally had to step out of the shower in order to pick up the bar of soap she had dropped (and my wife is not a large woman). We got a superior double room, we sprang for that expecting a little more space and were happy with what we got. The photos on the website really do represent actual rooms, you what you see which is not always the case. The bed was large and comfortable. We were on the street side which was noisy, there's a restaurant across the street, and a bar on either side of the hotel. It's not traffic noise it's people noise, Frenchmen singing American rock songs for instance. However, the windows were very soundproof when closed, the noise didn't bother us so we slept with them open. Either way the street noise wasn't a problem and the street itself is actually very quiet in the sense that its not busy. The service was excellent and very friendly. We were given an iron and an ironing board with a smile.The location was wonderful, it's a fantastic part of the city, and close to Metros, great restaurants, bars, and museums. We always keep our eyes open for different hotels when we walk around a city in case there's a better deal or the one we're staying in is booked in the future, and we didn't see a single hotel we would rather have stayed in. The price was good, you can get deals at this hotel. We got a 221\u00e2\u201a\u00ac room for 181\u00e2\u201a\u00ac booking online with a special internet price, and we got exactly what we expected. You can pay less in this part of the city but you may have a hotel adventure, i.e. a cramped room, and I mean cramped. My wife and I are no longer in our 20s and are not interested in hotel adventures so this was a very pleasant experience. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who isn't on a really tight budget and wants to stay in a comfortable room in a great part of the city.

If you are staying in a family room, I highly recommend requesting the one on the first floor near reception (Room 2). While it is not air-conditioned (which was a problem one night) it has an upper loft, and day beds on the lower level, giving room for a desk, TV, and sitting area. It was clean and bright, with comfortable bathroom/shower facilities, and fresh linen. It was also an enormous amount of space for the price in Paris. The location was ideal. The street is relatively quiet (and we were there during Fete de la Musique!) but very close to everything. Two blocks to Luxembourg Gardens for a morning run or an afternoon picnic. Convenient to bus (to Eiffel Tower), and Metro (everywhere else.) It is close enough to the river to be able to walk to the islands and the Louvre. And the neighborhood is very active, diverse, and full of cafes and brasseries for every budget and taste. My personal favorite was Boullion Racine, around the corner from the hotel. One downside, which we should have checked beforehand, was the 13 euro/pp breakfast offered by the hotel. Paying $80 US for four people to have croissants and coffee was a bit extreme. If you can find a package with this hotel that includes the breakfast, it is well worth it.

We were looking for a romantic, charming, well located hotel on the Left Bank and so we opted for this. The location is absolutely fine and the reception area is well presented and inviting, whilst the seating area to the right of the entrance is very comfortable with a modern fire place. However, I am confused why there is so much hype about this place. We asked to move rooms after being put in one of the \"renovated\" rooms on the top floor. I know Paris hotel rooms are renowned for being on the small side, but at this price I do not accept such an excuse. The room was small and dingy (if you step on tip toes you can see out of the window), and the toilet (no bath so I cannot call it a bathroom) was miniscule although it was fitted out to a modern standard. The second room we were shown to (on a lower floor) was much bigger, with two large windows. Again the decor of the bathroom (this one was spacious with a large bath) was modern and fresh. However, that contrasted markedly with the grim carpet and haggard old furniture (not rustic antique - the miss matching tables and chairs had always been cheap). The lighting was harsh (two long fluorescent strip lights on the far side wall give a less than warm hue to the tired blue painted room), so at nighttime you do not waste anymore time than is necessary getting ready to go out. It seems like renovation work is ongoing but the piecemeal fashion in which it is done means that rooms such as ours - new bathroom, old bedroom - are on the whole still pretty mediocre. Why not just fully renovate the room? The refurbished space only emphasizes how old and tatty the rest of the room is. We have stayed in Paris many times before and love everything about what is arguably the most beautiful and charming city in the world. This hotel (specifically our room) did nothing to add to the experience this time round, and given the price we were particularly disappointed. The previous time we stayed in Paris, we took a room at the Westin on the Right Bank in a gorgeous international standard room with unrivalled views of the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. Amazingly the nightly rate worked out virtually the same as this hotel! We were huge fans of the local area around this hotel and can completely understand why you would want to book a hotel in the Latin Quarter for your stay in Paris.

Even the Eiffel Tower was only 15 minutes or so away by bike (there's a Velib station on Rue Vaugirard very near the hotel). I did have a worry with the hotel that there were a couple of bars on the street, but perhaps my British experience of these things took over as even with the window open during the night we weren't disturbed at all.

Absolutely not, this hotel is a real home from home, we had a large room on the ground floor which was quiet, very clean and comfortable and had a great shower. The staff were couteous and most helpful (not forgetting Monsieur Sputnik the cat who will visit you to check you have settled in ok!) and made us feel very welcome. The buffet breakfast, although not cheap is plentiful and will set you up for for the days sightseeing. This hotel is situated in a quiet area close to numerous restaurants and bars and is in walking distance of many of the main Paris sights, for further afield we recommend the bus service which we found very efficient and easy to find your way around the city. A word of warning, if you intend to visit the Latin Quarter in September, book early as for some reason we found a lot of hotels were full, as was the Saint Paul but fortunately (for us) they had a cancelation.There is something about this hotel that makes you feel relaxed as soon as you walk in, we have taken away some fantastic memories and thoroughly recommend it and will be definitely return in the near future.", "Date": "September 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Fl.", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, Wonderful, wonderful!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "SFlowers50", "ReviewID": "UR10013204", "Content": "My husband and I had booked another Hotel, but after reading the reviews we decided to look for another, We were so overwhelmed by all the Hotels so we decided to pick an area in Paris we wanted to stay in and go from there, well after reading alot of reviews we came across the Hotel St.-Paul and decided it sounded just Wonderful, so we booked it and I must say we were still a little unsure, of our choice since its so hard to select something site unseen, but I have to say from the very first moment we set foot in the Hotel it was wonderful, its a small quaint little Hotel in a Great section of Paris, Our room faced the front and the room was a good size, and VERY CLEAN, the Bathroom was very nice and lots of HOT water, we didn't make it to the Breakfast room, but I did have the Continental Breakfast for room service and it was so nice and there was alot of items fruit, bread and cheese and yogart and wonderful coffee, and Juice. The Staff was ALWAYS very helpful and so nice, and \"Sputnick\" the Cat was always there to greet us, I fell in love with Paris and with this Hotel, I know you will too!

It is charming, clean and safe with personable and helpful staff at all times. The room was spotless and we found the beds very comfortable. The bathroom was large and hot water was always readily available. There is a computer in the lobby with free internet access and there is no charge for phone calls. Both great conveniences and money savers. The hotel is located in a great area - easy walking distance to great but not expensive restaurants, museums, gardens and shops. The Odeon metro station is only a block away which was a convenient way to get anywhere in the city. But, we also found that walking was a gret way to expereince Paris and this hotel provides a great location to access all directions easily. We found the hotel and neighborhood very quiet at night and yet only a 2-3 minute walk from the bars and restaurants that were \"alive\" until the early morning. There is a train agency 5 minutes away in the event you are looking to travel outside of Paris. We are Canadian and visited the Vimy Ridge memorial outside the town of Arras. Paris is full of \"wow\" moments but this is a day trip worth taking if you have the time. There are so many sights to see in Paris. We had full sightseeing days and most nights we would return to the hotel to change our clothes before heading out for dinner. You have to leave your large key at the front desk when leaving the hotel. This guarantees that you won't lose your key and you will always be greeted with a friendly bonjour or bonsoir.The staff always had good suggestions and proper directions. You will not be disappointed in this hotel. We will be recommneding it to our friends, although we would be more than happy to keep it our little secret!", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Saint Paul Rive Gauche", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197432-Reviews-Hotel_Saint_Paul_Rive_Gauche-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$189 - $343*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">43 rue Monsieur le Prince</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75006</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "197432", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c7/93/60/romantic-4poster-room.jpg"}}
