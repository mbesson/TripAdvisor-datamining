{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean but Small Rooms A Small Hotel hidden away in what appears to be the beginning of the industrial area just outside of Berlin. The rooms were small but quite clean and capable of lodging my friend and i for the 2 nights stay.The front desk staff was very friendly and great at pointing out options for travel to the downtown core and where local night life can be found.Only 10-15 minute walk and you can reach a nice area with good restaurants and night life, but to reach the tourist area downtown, you'd be looking at a 45 minute walk. The tram might be a better option for those not looking for that kind of walk. There is a direct tram 2 blocks away from the hotel, i believe it's 12 euro for the trip.", "Date": "Jun 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR474714258", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "bangemsmurf"}, {"Content": "gut gelegen, sehr nettes Personal   showReview(18180327, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR229009088", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "anonym100"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d581113-r16627856-Hotel_Sedes-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "581113", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
