And about a 10 minute walk to Sol. There are a ton of restaurants/cafes in the area including Pan Breads just around the corner and more. Great location to go shopping, literally steps away from H&M, Zara, Lefties, etc... You willl find lot's of these stores through the Sol area! El Corte Ingles is down the road in Sol for all you shopping afficionados! It was my second time in Madrid, I visited with family. Just a warning however, I saw at least on one occassion a prostitute hanging near the alleyway... and you must buzz to get in. But overall, a pleasant stay. Not sure I would stay here again given that there are other hotels in the area.

I was very pleased with the location--very close to metro stops, close to Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor. Lots to do within very short distance of this hotel, especially shopping. Truly a great location. But, as other reviewers have stated, there is a weird sewage-like smell in the rooms. Rooms are a little tired-looking, too.. Showers are best thing about rooms-- students loved them! Rooms for 4-5 people are crowded. Putting bunk beds in a room not really designed for bunk beds is not a good idea. I think a family would find the family rooms too small. Front desk clerks not particularly friendly. Front doors are always locked. You ring a bell and they buzz you in. Currently, the entire front of the hotel is covered in scaffolding. I thought we would hear a lot of construction noise, but we didn't. Never even saw anyone working. There's a grocery store just down the street from hotel. Breakfast buffet had a good variety of foods on it, and servers kept it well-stocked. If I were booking my own rooms, I probably would not choose this hotel again due to the smell of the rooms and the old furnishings in the room (torn curtains, for example).

Walking distance to the plazas, but far if you are elderly. No good restaurants close by and no good amenities for the price. Only one worth mentioning is free WIFI. Breakfast is not included in the price and for 18 euros can eat at a great local Cafe. Rooms are small and if you have more than 2 suitcases look somewhere else. Staff is not the friendliest and if you are out late -- plan on seeing Prostitutes less than 30 meters away from the hotel entrance. My wife did not appreciate the view. Quite a bit of a walk to the Plazas and authentic shopping unless you are just looking for the regular tourist souvenirs which takes all of about an hour to buy. Recommend to visit Torres Bermejas restaurant off Gran Via if you really want to experience authentic Flamingo Dancing. It's 39 euros per person minimum but well worth the 3 hour show....Absolutely amazing. If you go to Toledo make sure to book a full day trip and not half. Tourist guides don't spend any time at the sights and you feel rushed all the way through... Madrid is a great city but definitely take the time to experience the culture and there is so much more to see than things next to Plaza del Sol.

EVENSO, believe it or not, the room felt pretty clean, was well-swept, no dust bunnies, no grime. location-wise, we did not have a problem with it being on a major thoroughfare, and found the proximity to attractions very walkable. only time we fetched taxis was at night because of the temperature drop. my 15-yr old daughter loved being in a retail area--the hotel is next door to one of the two H&M's on gran via. we slept well at night (didn't hear street noise; heater worked well), except the floors get chilly from the draft coming in through the balcony doors. but, once under the covers, the room is quite comfortable. free wifi and laptop in the room, and two in the lobby. i'm hesitant to recommend this hotel because of the pet thing. but if you don't mind that idea, and can get a great price, than yes, i think it's recommendable for its location and family room.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in central location\u201d", "Author": "thefunkiestmunky", "ReviewID": "UR70941581", "Content": "This hotel has clean, modern rooms with great showers!!

About a 5 minute walk to Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor. We also got the Madridcard. It was about $100 US (for 72 hr card), but it allowed access to over 40 museums, the amusement park, zoo, aquarium, Teleferico(cable car ride) and unlimited access of the double decker tour bus. We took full advantage. The best thing to look for is the Menu del Dia (menu of the day). You get bread, first course, second course, dessert and a drink (usually wine, beer or sangria) from 9-15 Euros. There were some great little places to eat in Plaza Mayor. Cafe & Te (local chain) also had the biggest burgers ever, for about 7 euros. Wear good walking shoes because we walked alot. The museums were great, the history, the parks., street perormers.

It is 5 minutes walk to Sol and then another few minutes to the main square so the location was perfect.

The hotel looks good - it looks modern and quite plush. The first impression of the room is good. But there were some downsides. The major one being that the bathroom did not have a proper door! It was glass and did not close properly (a feature in all rooms) which I found a bit odd. Secondly, in our first room the shower kept getting flooded (something someone said in an earlier tripadvisor review so maybe its a problem with the type of showers they have) so we asked to be moved. Ask for room 510 its bigger than most and has a balcony. The rooms are quite small but have mirrors cleverly placed to make it look larger.

The hydro massage shower sprayed water only from one side, and the body shower heads could only needle spray (kind of hurt).

Luckily, I had the right cable and a laptop so that I could find my next hotel.", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cVery convenient hotel\u201d", "Author": "ecastro", "ReviewID": "UR3723291", "Content": "This was a great hotel for what we were looking for. there was a group of 3 rooms, both my brother had children so the bunk beds came in very handy and the kids loved it. we had superior double room which also came with bunkbeds but were put away and a nice king size bed. the room was a good size for us perhaps a bit tight for a family. they had a safe, a tv and A/C which came in very handy because it was extremely hot in madrid. the shower was the best - hydromassage, my brother who had the superior family also had hydromassage but his came with a radio in the shower and a seat. his room also came with a free laptop, they paid 110euros with breakfast we paid 99euros with breakfast. the best part of the hotel was the free internet access downstairs which was very convenient, the breakfast was excellent - they had all kinds of juices, cafe, spanish omelette, fruits, yogurts, breads, hams and cheeses. it was very filling. the locations was great for us being right on the gran via which is very close to puerta del sol and plaza mayor. also the cortes ingles was across the street as well as several clothing shops. it was very easy to get a taxi and our rental car agency was about half a mile down on the gran via which worked out well for us. there is a starbucks on the corner as well. taxi from the airport ran us about 20euros. The only negatives was the hotel was a bit on the dusty side, they cleaned everyday but i still found it a little dirty nothing too bad but if you are neat freak this may bother you. i had reservations on our return trip at another hotel but decided to stay here again just because it had such a convenient location especially in dropping our rental car off, there is a parking garage about 2 blocks away. the other negative is there were alot of prostitutes in the area right on the side and behind the hotel. the taxi driver warned us not to walk behind the hotel always walk toward the gran via. On our return trip we stayed in a standard and opted no breakfast because we were going to the airport in the morning, for 2 people i found this room to be perfect the only difference was no view - the first room had a great view and a little balcony, this room which was basically the same side had a view of a wall making the room a bit dark but for 75 euros it was worth it. would definitely return to this hotel in the future.", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cClean and Good Service\u201d", "Author": "Harps100", "ReviewID": "UR3577270", "Content": "We stayed here recently on a Stag weekend and I have to say that the hotel was great. We stayed in a family room which was very reasonably priced. The room even though it was quite small was very clean, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very nice with a great power shower and contempory design. The service at reception was very good and this hotel is very next to the shops on Gran Via and only 5 minutes away from Puerto del Sol. One thing I must add is that the red light district is right on the back of the hotel but there was no problems or any trouble because of that", "Date": "June 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cClean but still renovating\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3162021", "Content": "The family room was very clean and nice sized.
