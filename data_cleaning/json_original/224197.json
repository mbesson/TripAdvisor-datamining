For dinner we had to order one hour in advance, for the kitchen to prepare the food. We ordered the Red Snapper and the chicken breast. Both meals were very tasteless, and far from appealing. Possible the worst meal we have had here in P.R. My girlfriend also got a stomach ache from the poorly cooked chicken. In other words, we left the very next day..

I am baffled by the negative reviews. I don't understand what people expect for $100/night. Clearly it's not the Ritz Carlton but it exceeded my expectations for the price range. Yes, the rooms are a little dated, but the property is well maintained by an attentive and sweet staff. I noticed the same woman waiting tables in the hotel's restaurant and cleaning rooms - it's a small staff but they are very accommodating and eager to please. The beach right outside the rooms is a bit rocky, but the entire coastline in that general area is rocky. There are sandy beaches for those willing to walk or drive a bit. Alternately, you could enjoy the hotel's small but clean pool area that overlooks the ocean. There are many hammocks available for guests and numerous beach chairs as well. The whole atmosphere is very relaxing! The restaurant doesn't have a huge selection, but everything we had was very good.

This is a nice, simple, budget hotel in a spectacular location - if you don't mind being off the beaten track. It is tranquil and secluded and other than swimming and lying around in a hammock there isn't much to do but that was exactly what we wanted. Staff is very gracious and accomodating but everything is done slowly - which I think kind of added to the relaxing atmosphere. Rooms are simple, maybe a little run-down, but for the price we paid we were certainly not expecting luxury. Beach and pool were perfectly clean, grounds are beautiful. The dogs are kind of funny - there were just two very well-fed, well behaved mutts about the size of beagles that always hung around together. A fancier hotel would have kicked them out but to me they just added to the charm. Restaurant was completely adequate - again, nothing fancy but it was good.

We just returned and enjoyed our stay very much. No it is not a fancy resort but for about 100 bucks a nite you can't expect that. We had a couple issues with our room, the cable box did not work and we had a solid clear panel over our window instead of screens. If was fixed right away for us. There are 3 dogs that live there, but if you notice there are stray dogs every where you go in puerto rico. The dogs did not have mange, I would have to say they did have fleas though. They were very gentle and friendly dogs, in fact I fell in love with the little female and would have taken her home in a heartbeat if I could have. They could use a little medical care, she did have a small sore on her pad of the foot and in need of nail clippings. There was no dog poop anyplace that I saw. The food is ok and not a huge selection but reasonable priced. Service is very slow. Dinner reservations are required but after you are seated it was usually still an hour wait, not sure why they wanted reservations when your food was never prepared ahead of time like they mentioned. The resort is small and was very quiet. If you are looking for a quiet relaxing not busy spot then this is perfect for you. We very much enjoyed sitting around the pool area, there are a lot of shaded areas if you want to get away from the sun. The beach is very rocky, there are a few open sandy areas that I laid out on to enjoy the water. My husband fished from the shore and caught a few fish. There are plenty of lounge chairs and hammocks to enjoy. Didn't have to fight for one like you do the large resorts. We did not see any roaches or bugs, just a few of those tiny little ants outside on the balcony, none in the room. Lots of cute little lizzards around. Our room was clean, yes outdated and certaily could use some new paint and a few repairs. Housekeeping was great everyday with clean towels and basic cleaning. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. It appeared that a new owner or manager was there for a few days and repairs were started, so maybe there will be some good upgrades in the near future. The view alone is well worth the stay. If you want a fancy resort with lots of extras then stay in busy Puerto Rico. If you are looking for a relaxing, laid back, non tourist spot this place works. We drove through San Juan, I would never imagine wanting to stay in such a busy area. Wi Fi is only available in the dining/bar area but that was no problem. Usually very few people in there and staff was always great to offer a drink or snack. Other guests were very friendly and with such a small resort you ran into them often, always a conversation or smile. If you don't want to drive far the only other eating option we found was a place right down the road. Food was decent and priced fair. Staff there was very friendly also. Don't be afraid to stay here! If there is a problem let them know and they will help you out I am sure.

I've visited PR many times but never ventured to the Southern portion of the island. I looked this place up in my book, \"Puerto Rico on a Budget\". We considered a few places in the SE sector. While I wasn't looking for a budget-oriented hotel, I was searching for a place that felt less pretentious & populated by tourists. We found just that.... Upon pulling the car in, I was hesitant since the resort is quite small and off of a semi-busy road hugging the coastline. We had read zero reviews on TA and had no idea of relevant rates. We were immediatley taken aback by the astounding views and the near ocean front location. Strike that....this place is near falling into the water! I'm of course being dramatic, but see this while you can because if there is ever a hurricane, this place may be wiped off the map...it's that close to the Caribbean Sea. If you're looking for 4 or 5 star resorts, drive by this place w/ a fury. If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ocean front, quaint, friendly hotel w/ a pool, hammocks, restaurant (owner's Mom may cook here) & clean rooms....look no further. The rooms are dated, but there's hot water, a fridge, small kitchenette (no stove) & a view. Did I mention the view? Yeah, it's that good, especially from the restaurant (this was awesome as well but I won't exacerbate the details here).This is the kind of dive you dream of buying to run or fix up while vacationing in the Caribbean. Yes, this is THAT place. Beach is so-so for enthusiasts, but the views and surf more than make up for this. There was also a surprise drive-by local parade the night we stayed that we watched from the bathroom window! The owners are passionate for your approval and will point you to any place on the island for pleasure. Leave your gripes at the door and kick back to relax in this hidden oasis.... BTW...the cheapest room is around $60/night.

My family, with two kids age 12 and 15 stayed during Thanksgiving week. We wanted to stay at a place that resemebled a bed and breakfast, where we could see the ocean and the mountains and mingle with the regulars. Our last trip to the island was at a really nice resort in Rincon. For this trip, we wanted to mix more with locals and have a stay that was more personal. Caribe Playa supplied all our desires plus some. If you are used to staying in a plush, modern resort, then you probably would not enjoy your stay here. However, if you want a great place to stay with awesome ocean views and have that at home feeling with staff, then this is your place to stay. The ocean is so close, we hardly slept the first night because we were not used to the loud waves coming from the beach. We found the waves relaxing from the second night on. The resort is on a main road and you can hear some traffic at times, but it is not rediculous. You will hear more often the trucks and cars that have loud music playing than anything. We found it humorous, so many locals trying to outdo each other with their music, some really take this serious with huge speakers in their truck bed! The staff was unbelievably nice. I don't know how some people can say the staff was not awesome. I suppose they were really looking for a different place than Caribe Playa. The restaurant is more like a patio over the ocean, quite awesome. Breakfast was really good and for dinner, you have to try the main course for the day. If you try a burrito or burger, you will just be getting something plain. Try some of the specials, you will not be displeased. There are many food places close by as well, including a couple of supermercados. Let me see, what else. Cleanliness. OK, the rooms had some dirt and sand on the floor. We had a faucet that leaked. There were screens and not glass on the windows. But, really, this is not the hilton. I think they should change the name from beach resort to beach bungalow. The room is so close to the ocean, it is hard not to get the floors dirty. You should have seen our room's floor by the time we left. We had a great time outside and as a result, we unintentionally brought it some sand and dirt each time. Beach? - not much of one for laying out. This is not a place to stay if you want to swim at the beach each day. Water is too rough and beach is rocky, but it is very, very pretty. There are areas that do have lots of sand. There are many beaches close by where one can go to swim and lay out if desired. If you want to go shell hunting, the beach to the north of hotel is awesome. We found really nice shells. We found many, almost too many things to do close by. There is Carco Azul up the mountain in Patillas. A very nice park with trails that take you to an awesome, natural water pool. A must see. There is a bakery very close and the owner is very friendly, speaks english and has much more than bakery items. There is also a pizza shop close. We had a fresh hand tossed pizza that was great. If you drive north on 3, there are awesome views of the ocean overlooking the mountain cliffs. A lighthouse is also close. Lastly, the hammocks are really right on the ocean and very relaxing to use. Caribe Playa is not the Hilton, but neither is the price. We will most likely be back sometime after we explore the rest of the island. Gotta mention Bubby too! Our daughter likes animals a lot and she really made friends with the on site puerto rico dog - bubby.

We thought about Ponce, but wanted something right on the beach. My girlfriend found this really cute looking place in Patillas, called Caribe Playa. Based on the website, it looked great: white sandy beaches, hammocks, right on the water, romantic restaurant under the stars. We booked it for a night. Arriving in the late afternoon, we were happy to be there and relax beach-side after a long day of getting perpetually lost driving. The check-in/restaurant area was beautiful - open air, peaceful, well designed, clean-looking, etc... The woman at the front desk was very friendly and welcoming. She gave us a 2nd floor room, overlooking the ocean. Upon lugging all the luggage up the 2nd floor and walking in the room, something looked amiss. Upon walking into the bathroom and looking at the room, it appeared it was under construction. The bathroom was completely unfinished, the walls unpainted, construction equipment in the closet, and no screens on the windows. When finished this room seemed like it would be nice. So my girlfriend returned to the front desk to request a different room, for obvious reasons. I waited on the 2nd floor, not wanting to carry the luggage back down, without knowing where to go. She got the new room key and I told her to look at the room and make sure this room was OK, she came back very upset and told me to come with her. I opened the door to the new room and there were 4 cockroaches crawling across the floor. Back to the front desk again. We get another room and were told this is the last one available, which quite frankly is hard to believe since it was the low season and there didn't appear to be anyone around. We walked in this room and this one apparently hadn't been remodeled since the 60's. The floor was a cheap, worn tile - like what you see in a Walgreens . The colors were uncoordinated and faded. The air conditioner was rusty and leaked. The window did not have glass in it behind the shutters, just a cellophane-like material, which seemed to attract a lot of dead bugs on the outside. There were little bugs (nats, I think) crawling all over the bathroom - on the walls, towels, window, etc... There was about a 2in space between the bottom of the front door and the ground - making a nice little entrance for any of the many little crawly creatures to come right in. Had we not been in the middle of nowhere, with a habit of getting perpetually lost on PR roads, we would have left for another hotel. We decided to stay, dosing the entire room, bed, and bathroom in bug repellent and choosing to sleep on top of our beach towels. Upon walking to the restaurant to get a bite to eat, we encountered a dead mouse on the sidewalk. The evening had become almost comical at that point. We decided to take a quick detour to walk on the beach, which was rocky, with old chunks of cement scattered around. The restaurant was nice. The food was good and atmosphere, beautiful. However, we were really in no mood to enjoy it. We loaded up on drinks to fall asleep quicker! The next morning upon checking out and being relieved to have not been bitten by any bedbugs or any other creatures, we noticed that our room had a small sign indicating the prices for the high and low season. This room was priced at $85, while we had paid $120, upon checking in. When we went to the front desk, the manager tried charging us the full amount. We explained the drama of our stay - he never apologized. We told him about the price indicated our room. He frankly responded by saying that no rooms are priced like that. He didn't believe us. He went to check for himself, leaving us standing there. He came back with the sign and acknowledged it. He still never apologized. After what we went through I didn't expect to be refunded just for the price difference, I thought we deserved a complete refund. However, just wanting to leave and with some language barriers, I let it go.

It was a great drive seeing all of the beauty that PR has to offer. However if you suffer from motion sickness, steer clear of mountainous driving ( my youngest got car sick at least 8 times while there).

Our week was filled with early morning sunrise breakfast to finding little empty beaches to call our own for the day! Throughout the week we did see each side of the island and yes even traveled back to San Juan for the day and had a great time, ( one of the shuttle guys from airport gave us a great tip: got to San Juan after Tuesday, that was when all the Cruises left port) we had a great time, our favorite place was Fajardo, it had beautiful beaches, great deli's with homemade sweet breads (Cuban Sandwich was out of this world) We even went back to our favorite beach there for Thanksgiving day and found a road-side vendor selling roasted whole pig and turkey, we got a couple pounds of each and some can sodas and enjoyed our Thanksgiving turkey and pork on a breath taking beach. We as well traveled to El Yunque rain forest, it was amazing and would not miss it.

This was my second stay at this resort. If you are expecting a 5star resort then you will probably be disappointed but you are not paying for a 5star resort either. The setting- this is one of the most beautiful spots i have found on the island. The hotel is situated on a crescent shaped cove right on theocean. It is probably less than 50 feet from your room door to the water. and in between are numorous coconut palms with hammocks tied between them. BBQ pits if you choose to cook for yourself, and deck lounge chairs. We actually had baby sea turtles right outside our room door one night that we helped back to the sea. Awesome nice freestyle pool that their groundskeeper puts a lot of time and effort into keeping clean. And everywhere is the lush vegetation of the island. The Staff- Oscar, the manager was very helpful and friendly and a pleasure to talk to. The ladies that pulled double duty as housekeeping and waitresses were so incredibly sweet and helpful. They even rememebered us from our prior three day stay 14 months earlier. Even remembered that we had to leave early last year due to my wife's breast cancer and asked how she was doing and was genuinely concerned when i told her my wife had passed away. Try getting that at a 5 star resort!! George and Francis- the owners are wonderful people. I only saw Francis near the end of our stay this year but last year we saw a lot of both her and George. They made it feel more like we were visitors in their home than just hotel guests. The hospitality here is incredible. The food- while a little pricey it is no more expensive than your local appleby's but it is delicious and very filling generous portions. The boys had the penne con pollo and loved it. I chose the carribean pork chop meal with rice and beans the first night and the smashed plantain with chicken in butter and garlic sauce the second night. Both meals were incredibly good. and again- if you dont want to eat their awesome food you can grill steaks or puerto rican sausage for yourself at the bbq pits. The rooms- the rooms are comfortable and clean. nothing fancy but how much time are you going to spend in them anyways? They have cable tv, a wetbar and mini fridge and the airconditioningworked very well in all the rooms we have stayed in. Would be nice to have a small microwave available in the rooms- the only negative i could find. snorkeling is nice here- lots of reefs and fish right outside your door. currents can be strong at times and you should stay within the designated swim areas. The beach is kind of rocky soo wear water shoes or sandals if you are beach combing. Nearby there is a decent grocery store in Patillas ( i beleive plaza grocery) where you can get meat for the grill and pretty much any kind of food items you might need. The texaco near the hotel has a very friendly staff that speaks english very well ( that can be an issue in Patillas if you do not speak much spanish). There are small restaurants within a couple mile drive in either direction from the hotel if you care to venture out. We chose not to as we were please with the food at Caribe Playa. Overall i would highly recommend Caribe Playa as a nice , comfortable place to stay while on the island, with an awesome staff, good food, and nice, clean rooms placed right in the middle of paradise.

As far as the room being cleaned everyday, the bed was made but the sand was not washed out of the shower. The eating area was very nice, but the food was not. I ordered Shrimp and Chicken Primavera, and was very disappointed to find that it was exactly the kind that comes out of the Green Giant bags from the supermarket ( I buy them all the time, I could tell) and they charged me 15.95 for it. My husband got a beef steak, which turned out to be cheap cube steak. Don't waste your money, don't eat here. Also, don't buy beer here. Go to Wal-Mart and buy a 12 pack for 9 dollars, instead of 2.50 a beer here. A single cup of coffee is also 1.50. Also, one night at about 11 pm, the grounds people came in and started watering the plants right infront of our door and were spraying the walls with a powerful stream of water, loud enough to be disturbing. This hotel is also, very very far away from anything. It is about an hour drive to Fajardo, and about 2 to San Juan. I think I would stay in Fajardo next time, it took a very long time to get anywhere from the hotel. On a positive note, the grounds were kept very clean, and the sand (what little they had) was raked everyday. The was very little parking in the parking lot. It was fun to walk down the beach with a flash light and look for sea shells, look closely, they are very tiny.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "State College, PA", "Title": "\u201cFor seekers of beauty, romance, tranquility at very moderate prices, this place can't be beat\u201d", "Author": "rdt4", "ReviewID": "UR26345894", "Content": "Caribe Playa is the essence of tranquil simplicity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pure and peaceful tropical beach \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 white sand, lapping waves, waving palms At Your Door (in fact, you can see all of them from your bed).

Trust me, you CANNOT beat the prices they offer. I would have been VERY disappointed in this place had I paid the full price. The location: pretty unbeatable. Every room is right on the water, no bad view in the place. However, we did not swim at all at this beach, much too rocky and rough waters. Plan to drive to better beaches. The room: we were promised a phone, wet sink, ceiling fan, and coffee maker. There was no phone. (luckily our cells got plenty of service). There was no counter or wet sink in the room. There was a coffee maker, but not mugs. The biggest disappointment, however, was the lack of a ceiling fan. Because there was no ceiling fan, we were forced to keep the A/C running all night. The A/C machine was so loud, though, that we could not even hear the (fairly loud) surf right outside of our door. Had we had a ceiling fan, the stay would have been much improved. Also, the hot water ran out after about 1/2 of a shower. Yes, this place is right on the road. However, the road is small and there was not much traffic any night after about 10pm. The loudest part of our stay was actually the staff. Our room was right next to the restaurant so we heard the staff taking out the garbage, transporting dishes, talking (very) loudly to each other, etc. That was pretty disheartening, as it seemed as though they did not care at all about t he fact that paying guests were only separated by a thin wall and open windows. The place could easily be improved: offering the amenities they promise, having better lighting, training the staff to be more accommodating. All in all, however, if you book it at a discount rate, you will be satisfied. We did not eat at the restaurant. The prices seemed a bit high. Also, be prepared to find your own parking. Though there is a parking lot, it was full every night by the time we returned to the hotel around 10pm. The road is very narrow and windy so parking can eat up about 30 additional minutes of your time. We also did not swim in the pool.

I would never even consider staying anywhere else in Puerto Rico! The staff were friendly and helpful, the grounds were tastefully decorated, and everything was meticulously clean. My family would have been happy spending the full five days just hanging out at this resort! Go here if you want to beat the crowds! We went during Spring Break and hardly saw anyone there! The price for this hotel is not bad at all, considering it is a private resort right on the ocean. I don't believe you can find any hotel of this quality at this price anywhere else in Puerto Rico. -Rooms- The rooms were clean and neat. They weren't anything fancy, but they had everything you need. (e.g. a fridge, an airconditioner, a t.v....) The traffic can get a little loud at night, but the air conditioner blocked out most of the noise. Even still, ear plugs wouldn't be a bad idea. When you walk outside in the morning, you will either walk onto a shared belcony or a shared porch. Both are very nice! -Hotel Grounds- The grounds left nothing to be desired! Tall palm trees were all over the place, with comfortable hammocks hanging in between them. The beach was long and wide, with smooth sand and plenty of beach chairs. Guests with ground-level rooms are only feet from the beach! The whole area is beautifully decorated with tropical flowers and plants. The ocean water is warm and clear. The coral reef that dominates the area is teeming with life! I highly reccomend buying some snorkeling gear if you plan on visiting! Although the water isn't as rocky as many people make it sound, it's a good idea to bring water shoes. The ocean is better for snorkeling than swimming. If you'd like to swim, the pool area is private and gorgeous! -Food- The view at the restaraunt is incredible! However, the food is about average. I would reccomend going to one of the local restaraunts for dinner. The Mar de la Tranquilidad was our favorite! -Staff- The staff was always courteous and friendly! They were always willing to help if we needed anything. One day I found a brown coconut that had washed ashore and I was trying to crack it open. One of the staff saw my attempts and told me that the coconut needed to be fresh if you wanted to eat it, he then walked away. A while later, he returned with a lovely green cocunut with the top cut off and two straws in it! He told us that this kind of coconut had a soft, sweet fruit. He then showed us how to cut the fruit off of the shell to eat it easier. What a kind thing to do! -Wildlife- Because this hotel is far away from the bustling city scene, there was a great number of different animals to see. Hermit Crabs can be found crawling on the edges of the beach, Green Anole lizards are everpresent on the trees, larger lizards called Amievas bask in the morning sun, and lightning-fast Sand Crabs stroll along the beach at night. The hotel also has a large pet Iguana caged near the entrance. However, the greatest sighting of the trip was a Manatee rolling in the water right out in front of the hotel! -Conclusion- This small resort gave us the feeling that we were in paradise! Sure, it wasn't perfect. But it was a better experience than I could have ever dreamed of!", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cGreat View and relaxation\u201d", "Author": "travelingman101", "ReviewID": "UR21321106", "Content": "If you are looking for a place to relax and be near the water this is a great place.

Knowing what to expect is always helpful (thanks Trip Advisor) but I think when you book a 3 star hotel you need to keep your expectations in check. Caribe Playa is a quaint, super cute 30 room hotel. It was very quiet and peaceful as no personal radios are allowed on the beach. We had a double, nicely sized room which suprisingly came with a mini-fridge and kitchen sink. We did have traffic noise in our room (unit #1) as was warned by other reviewers. In the morning you open your door and the beach is at your feet. There is a amply sized wooden deck just off the main house for sun bathing (see photo). The pool was clean and shaded in the afternoons should you want to get out of the sun. The beach is a little rocky but it is nice. As there are no other hotels beside Caribe Playa it is just you neighbors/other guests on the beach. You can pull the lounge chairs right in the water. The grounds are well maintained with hammocks strung between trees should you want to take an afternoon nap. Take the time to walk around the bay and look back at the hotel (beautiful, see photo). We had dinner at the restaurant. They serve typical Puerto Rican food which means most everything is fried, but it was good (large portions, see photo). They serve fantastic coffee in the morning. Mid morning they made us fresh mango coladas which were fabulous. I made several trips back and forth for these drinks while spending a leisurely day on the sun deck. The staff was very polite but on their own time, however a 3 star hotel on an island usually equals a slower pace - you should not be surpirsed by this. At times we felt like we had the place to ourselves which is exactly what we were looking for - seclusion. I live in San Juan and I am always looking for a quick get away from the traffic, noise, and clutter. Caribe Playa is only an hour from San Juan and the second half of the drive has many nice views. We ended our trip on the 3rd of July which was perfect timing because the little hotel was completely booked for the 4th, meaning the secluded feeling was lost somewhat.

However, due to a problem with our rental car and a traffic delay, we actually arrived at 2:30 AM. I knew no one would be in the office and I was afraid we would be sleeping in the car, however when we walked up to the office in the small hours of the morning, I immediately saw an envelope with my name on it that contained our room key and a nice note asking me to stop by in the morning to check in. Very nice! Yes, this is a long drive from the airport, but you also have to compare the room prices to those around San Juan. The views are beautiful, the hammocks wonderful. This hotel has some of the nicest grounds I've ever seen. The photos don't do it justice. The ocean swimming is pretty average, but safe enough if you stay inside the breakers. We saw some people surfing at little way down the beach so we presume there is some good wave action. The pool was very nice and clean, but the hot tub doesn't actually heat up. We asked about it and were told the heater hadn't been working for some years. The sun deck is a great place to relax and soak up some rays. The rooms are just okay. The decor is average. The bedding and towels are very clean. Two out of three mornings, we didn't get hot water or water pressure. We decided it was probably due to the solar hot water heating and we just slept too late to get any. The last morning we were up early and we had plenty of hot water and water pressure. There was a nice large apartment sized fridge in the room that we stocked up with drinks and snacks (purchased at the local super Wal-Mart), which was great. One thing I thought was funny was the coffee maker; it had a sign next to it inviting us to enjoy a nice cup of Puerto Rican coffee, compliments of the Caribe Playa and advising us we could purchase additional coffee at the office. There was however, no coffee and no coffee cups. No sugar, creamer, etc, either. I don't know if these items could have been obtained, as we're not big coffee drinkers and didn't ask about it. The road noise wasn't an issue as we couldn't actually hear it over the air conditioner. We tried the on-site cafe only once, for lunch. Not all menu items are available at any given time. The food is fairly average, the prices are fairly reasonable. One item we ordered was a club sandwich. We were told that they didn't have any bacon. So, we got the club, no bacon. This ended up being a ham and cheese sandwich. Not great ham or cheese either. Chopped ham and Velveeta type american cheese. The menu had ham & cheese sandwiches for $5 and club sandwiches for $7.50. Guess which price the charged us? The empanadas we ordered were fresh and very tasty, with a nice dipping sauce. We did not try any other local restaurants. There are not very many other restaurants around that looked \"safe\" to our admittedly americanized tastes. We also saw several roadside vendors selling roasted this or that which smelled wonderful. Since we still had over a week of vacation remaining we didn't want to risk any stomach trouble. My suggestion to anyone going that way would be to go to your family doctor, stock up on some heavy duty stomach remedies and eat everything you can get your hands on, because it all smelled so wonderful I did feel like we were missing out. All in all, we enjoyed out time, but I wouldn't have wanted to spend longer than the three days we were there.

The Carribe Playa Beach Resort -- and a rented car to explore the southern part of Puerto Rico -- sounded perfect. Yes, all my Puerto Rican friends shook their heads and asked, \"Patillas??? Why are you going to Patillas?\" but we stuck with our plan. First, the positives: The photos of this place do not lie. Caribe Playa Beach Resort really is right on the beach with some breathtaking views. Palm trees, beautiful water and sunshine we were lucky to have for our four days there -- it all looks too good to be true on the website but the views really are this amazing. There are beach chairs and hammocks all over the place to lounge around on, there is an outdoor restaurant with the same excellent views right there too. The water when we were there (November) was a very swimmable temperature. The staff was for the most part extremely helpful and friendly (more later) and the coffee in this place was excellent. The nicest thing of all isn't so much about this place as it is a commentary about the island -- I have travelled quite a bit and I have never met friendlier people than the people in Puerto Rico. We must have stopped to ask for directions a thousand times, and every time people went out of their way to help us. Strangers smiled at us and said hi. People constantly wished us good morning. There are a lot of people who are nice for the sake of being nice on this island. The not so positives: As long as you are not expecting to be pampered like a spoiled diva, most of the \"not so positives\" of the Caribe Playa Beach Resort aren't really all that bad. Still, you should know that the restaurant staff tend to take a while with your food, as in a very long time. Also, as many have mentioned, there is some noise from the traffic along the highway, which may disturb light sleepers. (I loved the sound of the surf lulling me to sleep, however). Of particular disappointment to me was the fact that the king size bed we were told we'd have was really just two twin beds stuck together and covered with a king size bed spread and sheets to make it look king size. I really wouldn't have cared if I had had to share a bed with my brother or somebody, but for my honeymoon with my wife, not having a big crack down the middle of our bed would have been nice. The water, while swimmable, is not what you might have in mind when you think, \"Ahhh, the Carribean.\" It has lots of rocks at points and it isn't clear as in snorkeling type water. Lastly, you should know that this place is FAR from the San Juan Airport, so if you have a late arriving flight, you probably won't get in until the middle of the night, and that's if you don't get lost, which we did (rather badly.) The roads on the southern part of the island are in general windy and not always in the best of shape. We ended up going north at times to Fajardo and over to San Juan anyway, where the infrastructure really did seem to be better suited to tourists. Still, we had some great views driving on the Carribean side, particularly going east of Patillas, we met friendly people wherever we were, and despite some construction down there at times as well, we felt good about getting to know the less-known side of the island. It somehow seemed more authentic, which is what we wanted. The only real negative about our stay which really was a shame and knocks this hotel down a couple of notches, was that in the middle of our second night, I awoke to hear my wife shrieking. I sat up in bed quickly -- what was it? A rat? A burglar? No. My wife was stading in a huge puddle of water. She had gotten up to use the bathroom and had instead found that the toilet had not been functioning properly -- it had kept filling its tank continuously without stopping, and had flooded our room. I walked through the water and turned off the toilet (rather proud of myself to figure out to do this after being awakened suddenly at 3 AM) and we used our towels to soak up as much of the water as we could. After the sun came up, I explained the problem to the hotel manager, who agreed to put us in a different room, but in the end, one of the maintenance guys fixed the toilet and we ended up staying in our original room. Not a huge deal, but if I were the manager of a hotel and I wanted people to come back, I would have offered us something -- a free meal at least -- if two of my guests had lost a good night's sleep and not been able to use a bathroom until the morning because one of my toilets didn't work. Instead, I had to pracically beg for this, and explain over and over to skeptical management that it wasn't us who had stopped up or damaged the toilet -- it just didn't work. In the end, they gave us a free dinner. Much appreciated. But if I hadn't complained about it, they would have done nothing. You have to go to Caribe Playa Beach Resort -- and the southern side of Puerto Rico -- with the mentality that even though it's the U.S., it's in many ways a foreign country, with all its positives and all its charm, as well as it's inconveniences that might annoy you when you aren't used to them. If you keep that in mind and are okay with that, then this place will be just fine for you (and also if you feel that toilets are overrated.)", "Date": "March 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicagoland", "Title": "\u201cWarm wine, cold water\u201d", "Author": "agnes15547", "ReviewID": "UR6650388", "Content": "We stayed there for one night only and we woke up more tired than you can imagine.

The view of this place is totally AMAZING! The pictures on the internet from the beach are exactly how it is, even better. However, the service and the place are something different. We believe that the rooms are outdated, and are overpriced. It's more like a family camp site where you pay $50.00/day than a hotel. Even more, we wouldn't call it a hotel, is more like a Motel. The staff of the motel do not have any training in customer service. They really don't care if you are satisfied or not. The beaches are just for you to enjoy it with your eyes. They are rocky and dangerous beaches. We had to go to another beach 15 min away from the place and pay to use it. The parking space is very, very limited and sometimes you have to park on the road and if you get lucky to find a space it could get blocked by other cars. As a result of this, you will have to wait for the motel staff to call every room to have them take out the cars. To eat at the hotel you have to make reservations an hour before they start serving and you have to pick between two dishes. The food is not good at all. For tourists, is really a bad representation of our cuisine. When we received our dinner the meat was completely raw and they had to cook it again. Overall, we had a good time not because the motel and the staff did something to make our stay better, but because we tried not to think in all the inconvenients that we had. If we are in the area again some other time, we would not stay in this place and definetely not recommend it to anyone.

The young lady who was in \"charge\" had no idea what that meant and certainly could not handle the unhappy group. She finally refused to answer questions or call anyone to take care of the water heater. About 90 minutes into my hamburger order, a young man, the \"manager\" showed up for about 5 minutes, listened to some complaints, got his dinner and left. That was the first and last of him. Another 90 minutes later, I got my hamburger. I was the first to order and the very last to eat. Good burger though. The rooms are nothing special. You have no choice but to use the AC because the windows have plastic covering them. Only the bathroom let in outside air. Phones? Well, maybe, maybe not.
