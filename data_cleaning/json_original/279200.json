It is located just around the corner after La Pedrera on Rossello street. We had made a reservation through Booking.com and were given a room on the 6th floor with an amazing view of Gaudi's La Pedrera (or Casa Mila) from our room window. Our room was spacious and had a modern feel to it & the bathroom was large. If you push the room window correctly, you will be able to make quite a significant opening to let the cool fresh air in. Free wifi is available in the hotel & there is a PC at the lobby for free access to internet. The metro station 'Diagonal' is a few steps away from the hotel. Casa Batllo is about 5 min walk. While La Rambla about 15min walk. The hop on & off bus stop is on the left of the hotel (in front of La Pedrera). Very convenient. There is a small cafe on the right of the hotel just a few doors away (beside the Hotel Next To). It serves a good breakfast for 3 Euros per person (bocadillo/sandwich + 1 drink/tea/coffee/juice). . Tip:If you intend to take the Hop On & Off Bus Turistic, or plan to visit Sagrada church or Casa Batllo or La Pedrera, ask the hotel reception for the voucher booklet. It costs Euro4 per person. Contains discount vouchers for various tourist attractions.The hop on & off bus costs Euro23. It costs Euro17 after you show the coupon (discount of E6 per person), Nede to show one coupon per person. 10% off Casa Batllo & La Pedrera coupon inside. Euro 1 discount for Sagrada Familia. We took the airport bus from Barcelona El Prat airport. Costs Euro 6.50 per person one way, about 30 minutes. Alight at the last stop @ Placa Catalunya. The bus stop was under construction at the time so they alighted us along Passeig de Gracia, even nearer to Hotel Actual. Walk towards the direction of La Pedrera or Casa Batllo. Once you pass La Pedrera, walk ahead till the end of the block and turn right to Rossello street. The hotel is just a few steps from the main street of Passeig de Gracia. .

Having looked at many, many hotels in the city before booking this one, it was certainly good value for money, the location perfect and the rooms were spacious and clean. We opted not to have the hotel breakfast which was over 13 Euros each per day, preferring to drop into a local cafe or grab something from a stall as we walked around, so I can't comment on the food. We didn't have a great view from the room which was at the front of the hotel overlooking Rosselo, but then we weren't planning to spend much time in there anyway, so it wasn't really a consideration when booking. The safe in the room was great for stashing away passports etc. and meant we could leave the bulk of our cash behind each day. The minibar was reasonably priced compared to many hotels I've stayed in, charging 1.90 Euros for a bottle of water or soft drink, which was welcome on the first night before we'd been out to buy anything (although the tap water was supposedly safe to drink, I didn't want to risk it - I've been caught out before). There were a few minor niggles. Firstly, there's no means of making yourself a tea or coffee in the room - there may have been a machine in reception to buy a drink but I didn't actually notice. It would have been nice to have the option first thing in the morning, so make sure you stock up on supplies if you want something other than water straight from the tap when in your room. There was no bar at the hotel, so we couldn't nip down there to get anything. Secondly, the weather was still in the low 20's whilst we were there. Although all the locals seemed to be wearing thick coats, we didn't progress from short sleeved t-shirts even during the evening, so it was a bit of a shocker to have the heating on in the room when we arrived. All attempts to get the air-con working to cool us down were futile, so I went to reception to report it not working only to be told it was switched off - hot air only. Yea, ok, it was November but even with the heating off, it was stifling in our room and my keyring thermometer was hovvering around the 30 mark the whole time. That brings me on to the final niggles. The window to the room was prevented from opening more than a couple of inches as it was behind the desk. Short of moving a whole set of furniture including the TV, we had to settle for the small gap to cool down the room. That said, it was hellishly noisy on the street below until well into the early hours and even though were were on the 5th floor, it was impossible to leave it open if we wanted to get any sleep (which meant we roasted in our bed when it was closed) so a bit of a sleepless break for me who likes it cool and quiet. Those negatives aside (and to be honest, they weren't things to get too wound up about, just to be aware of if you want to book a room here), this was a great hotel in a great location for a reasonable cost. If you do book, the transfer to the city from the airport is dead easy. The Aerobus was just over 9 Euros return per person and drops you at Placa Catalunya, a 10 minute stroll, pretty much in a straight line. Overall, a great place to stay and I'd definitely book again if I were to return.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "AVELGEM", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel near Passeig Gracia\u201d", "Author": "Rik D", "ReviewID": "UR120117256", "Content": "Stayed 4 days in room 111 at Hotel Actuel Barcelona, following a city trip.

The restaurants and tourist locations around the hotel are plenty; but I do recommend taking the tourist bus around town so you can get to more far away places like the soccer stadium and other points of interest around the city, like Park Gruel, the place of many pieces of Antoni Gaudi's famous works of art. We paid for a triple rate.

My key never works when I go to my room which is annoying but I couldn't even get into the hotel! The guys across the street were laughing. We went across the street and they were calling the person who supposedly works here because we were banging on the door. I have never experienced such a thing. It was honestly unbelievable, 5AM and locked out of my hotel. The guy finally came down and opened the door, me and my boyfriend waiting, along with one single woman, luckily she had us to keep her company. We finally got into the hotel and he asked us to be patient and wait for another elevator as he was using one. UNBELIEVABLE.

It was a pleasure to interact with them and many times they provided us with crucial information. Cannot say enough good things about them. The hotel itself is of an attractive minimalist design. Nice reception area, cafe and lounge. We asked for a quiet room (noise can be an issue in Barcelona) and were given a first floor room (no view) that was indeed almost tomb-like quite except around 8:30AM? when housekeeping staff would make a beeline for the supply closet near our room. Did not have an issue with this. The room itself was nicely decorated and designed, albeit a bit small. There are larger rooms and the room prices are very reasonable. The breakfast in the Cafe at 12 Euros was a bit pricey. Could not get the Wi-Fi to work, so used the lobby computer, which worked fine. Overall, an appealing ambiance without some of the amenities of more expensive hotels, such as a fitness center, swimming pool or business conference rooms, with a price to reflect this. Great for those watching how they are spending their money. The location is terrific, high end, safe and close to many attractions. Designer shops, high end shopping venues, restaurants and more reasonably priced shopping abounds everywhere.

The hotel is lovely, the staff nice, the rooms crisp and well designed, the bathroom comfortable with a large countertop and a good shower. We had no complaints about room size. It was modest but the design made it work well. We moved around with ease. There were small nightstands on each side, an easy chair, a desk, and a long bench where you could easily place your suitcases for packing and unpacking. Our suitcases fit under the bench for storage. Our 2 very comfortable beds were made up separately but right next to one another, which allowed for more space on either side. That worked for us as a mother and daughter - 2 friends traveling together might have liked a little more separation though. The lighting was good. A flat panel tv hung on the wall. There was a built in armoire, with shelves on one side, hanging space on the other. Some of the shelf room was taken up by a small safe (fit my netbook!) and a refrigerator, but the space was still adequate for us. I can't imagine how much stuff people must be traveling with if they did not have enough storage space. A nice feature is that the entry hall and bathroom can be closed off from the main room with a solid door. We heard no sound from the elevators, even though our room was right next to them. There was free wifi. If you are sensitive to street noise, and you want to keep your window open, do not take a room facing the street. My daughter wanted the window open all the time, so we moved to a rear room, which overlooked the rear of La Padrera. It was very quiet at night, but unfortunately there were several projects going on in neighboring buildings and so we heard the construction noise when we were in the room during the day. This is not an issue unless you spend the day in the room - not typical for either a business or recreational visitor. Closing the window solved the problem almost completely.

We had the room 510, facing the back. The double door system does block any interior noise. The view was partially somewhat obstructed (wall on the right side, 3-5 meters from the window). But otherwise we had a view of Casa Mila, one of Gaudi's masterpieces. Room 511 has better view. It is closer to the elevator though. But I think it shouldn't be noisy as its bathroom should buffer any noise - Decent Location. Very close to Metro Diagonal on the green line (the main line for tourist's interests). Located in the quiet Eixample. 15 min walk to Placa de Catalunya. - Complementary internet access. CONs: - Locations: Although Eixample is very nice, quiet, close to everything, it's still not my preferred area. Barri Gothic is livelier. The hotel is not located in a dead zone though. It's alive but it's just more upscale residential with restaurants here and there, while being close to everything - The rooms are a bit on the minimalistic side.

The Tripadvisor reviews were all really good and the deal price was OK. And it exceeded our expectations - all recent good reviews were correct! Some useful pointers on this hotel - we didn't realise till the 2nd night that the air conditioning (very effective) in the room would only switch on if the window is closed. The TV does offer varied channels but only CNN and BBC World News were in English (there's no DVD player and no radio channel) . However sightseeing around the city (Gaudi's great buildings, the harbour area, Las Ramblas street walks etc) meant missing any decent TV was no great hardship. You can check out on your last day as late as 12 noon, and leave your luggage reasonably secure off the lobby if you have a late flight home. In Oct 2008 there were major road works at the Diagonal junction near the hotel which made access from that metro station to the hotel with heavy luggage in fact quite difficult (we used a taxi on the way home for the first part of our airport journey, as the metro change involved a very long walkway tunnel at one stage of the airport journey). Also be aware that the modern classy lifts are smooth and silent when moving, but give quite a loud \"bonk\" when stopping at a floor \u2013 in case you\u2019re a light sleeper and get a room near the lift (only 5 rooms on each floor). The receptionists and breakfast room staff were friendly and helpful - and even got a plumber to our room within 20 minutes one day when we ran out of toilet tissue (something got lost in translation I think). We thought our inclusive buffet breakfasts were good including excellent pineapple, kiwi fruit and peaches, hard boiled eggs, cheeses, cold cuts of meats, croissants, rolls, bread and toast, jam and marmalade, fruit juices and teas or coffee. We thought the bathroom was fine \u2013 including the bath and shower. The hotel has a certain wow factor with its modern minimalist and stylish decor and furnishings.

Friendly staff. Small room, but very comfortable bed and linens. Average-sized (surprisingly, considering the size of the room) modern clean bathrooms. On a busy street, but when window closed, the city street noise disappeared. We live in a city, so the street noise didnt bother us. Less than one block from Metro. 10 minute walking distance to Gaudi's Casa Batll\u00f3, and it might have been a 10-15 minute walk to Gaudi's Sagrada Familia, if we hadnt gotten lost. On Metro, 3 quick stops to Las Ramblas. If we were to do again, we would book a place closer to Las Ramblas, as most of the nightlife was located there. Metro is not 24 hours. I think it stops after 12 am. Beyond that time, you are stuck with a taxi, which can get pricey (about 5-6 euros). And at that hour, and everyone trying to make their way home after a night of partying, competition for a taxi is fierce! Overall, I would recommend this to my parents or a couple who wouldnt really partake in Barcelona nightlife.", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Actual", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d279200-Reviews-Hotel_Actual-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$128 - $200*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rossello 238</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Corner Passeig de Gr&aacute;cia</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "279200", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/86/c6/ee/recepcion.jpg"}}
