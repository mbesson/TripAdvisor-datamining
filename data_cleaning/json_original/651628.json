We spent just one night there and were satisfied with it. The location is great, not far from metro station, close to Hospital de Sant Pau and Sagrada Familia. It\u2019s very convenient for those who want to see Sagrada. The room was clean, modern and light. The bathroom is large with all facilities. The price was reasonable. We paid 40 Euros for a double room per night. The only minus is that the woman at the reception did not speak English at all and did not even want to understand us. In general the hotel is nice for one night. For long stay in Barcelona I would recommend to take hotel in the centre.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago IL", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable hotel for a short stay\u201d", "Author": "Paul S", "ReviewID": "UR121210364", "Content": "Hotel Everest is next to the Hospital Sant Pau, in a quieter area of Barcelona, but it's convenient to the Metro and a short walk to Sagrada Familia.

We found that the room was not properly made up, no bath towels or toilet paper and soap and the management couldnt communicate in English. It was exasperating. On top of that, the door to the roof top balcony was faulty and could not lock! We had to push the table against the door for security. We did try to change the room the next day but found it so difficult to communicate with them as nobody spoke English. Five members of the management we have encountered and none understood what we were trying to say despite us using a phrasebook. On top of that when we checked out, they conveniently said their credit card machine was broken and asked for cash instead. What more, we found another hotel which was nearer to Ramblas, a boutique hotel of the same price with breakfast.!
