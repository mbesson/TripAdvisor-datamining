After a nap and a shower, I was ready for a little California sunshine.

The Inn itself is very charming, decor is musically themed with instruments and art work in the lobby and common areas. I particularly loved the old fashioned elevator lined in red velvet, with a door to open before you get in, piped classical music to enjoy the ride. Our room was very comfortable and clean and efficient use of a small space. Fridge and microwave with a small sink and utensils available. Flat screen TV with good reception, not much choice of channels but we didn't travel to watch TV so that was fine. Bed was extremely comfortable, overhead fan. With the window open the breeze was very pleasant, street noises could be distracting if you're a light sleeper. Turndown service each evening and chocolates on the pilllow. No ice machine on the floor, but just buzz down to the front desk and they are very efficient and quick. All the staff we dealt with were extremely helpful and very pleasant. I'm an early riser so was down in the lobby reading before 5am so as not to disturb my husband -- night staff brought me coffee (without asking). I can't recall all the names to give kudos to, but Jessie on the night shift and Alex on the day shift stand out. Complimentary breakfast was very good -- juice, coffee, cereal, muffins, bagels, cream cheese, fresh fruit and hard boiled eggs. Service in the restaurant was excellent as well. We ate dinner there one night, the service was great, on the night we went they were out of beef having sold out the hotel the night before and it was a Sunday so our choices were somewhat limited. We had salmon and pork chops between my husband and I. Not overly impressed with the seasoning of the food, for the price ($200 with a bottole of wine) we had expected better. Again, however the service was great. Lots of nearby places to eat, very convenient for transport. We got a 2 day pass on the Hop On Hop Off double decker bus and saw all the sights we wanted to, it stops all over the city, Golden Gate Bridge, the wharf, ChinaTown and they run by every 15 - 20 minutes, a great way to see all the sights. The hotel was an extremely pleasant place to return to after the hustle and bustle of the city, peaceful and quiet. Not sure that I would take kids along to this hotel, especially if they're energetic. We did see several couples with infants.

This hotel is practically across the street from that location in an excellent and untouristy part of the city. We had booked a suite and were very pleased with what we received. Our suite was situated on the top floor in the back. Most importantly we had real privacy and quiet. There was no one above us and there were no common walls with any other rooms. Great! We had 2 complete and roomy bathrooms and 2 flat screen tv's. There was a large entry foyer from which one could enter either the bedroom suite or through french doors connecting to a separate living room with its own complete bath. The king bed was very comfy. I like to stay up late and my wife likes to go to bed early. I respect her quiet time so it is important that I not disturb her. With the great floor plan she wasn't bothered at all. There was a small kitchenette with frig as well. Everything from the carpets to the bathroom fixtures were clean and of good quality. Nothing showed signs of wear. The included breakfast was continental in style, typically adequate but not gourmet, served in a beautiful wood paneled dining room. The coffee was excellent. Old world and very classy with an art and musical feel. It was our impression that most of the other clients staying here are elder, sophisticated and well traveled. You won't be finding any bumbling and rude tourists at this location. They'd never find it. We booked a limo from the airport through the hotel staff and it was great as well; very professional and courteous treatment. I checked and the price was only about $5 more than for a taxi from SFO to the hotel. We'll do exactly the same thing next time. The price from SFO was $45. Its only a couple of blocks to Market Street where you can hop on the \"F\" Trolley. It will take you all the way to the historic clock tower or anywhere inbetween for just $2, or 75 cents if you're a senior or close to it. These trollies are restored and were built in the 40's. A great feel and ride. Mostly locals take it. Just take exact change and pay onboard. It was important for us that this hotel is practically across the street from the War Memorial Opera House where one can see the best Ballet and Opera the west coast of the US has to offer.

Our room was a little on the smaller side based on other hotel rooms I've stayed in, but I didn't see any of the other rooms at the Inn to compare. I stayed with my youngster daughter, and it was perfectly cozy. The elevator broke down the first night we were there, and this was about 8pm at night. We had to walk up 6 (small) flights of stairs which wasn't that big of a deal. I remember thinking they probably wouldn't have it fixed until the following afternoon or so, but lo and behold it was fixed the following morning. Their front desk staff as well as the dining room staff were all very friendly. Front desk staff in particular were on their toes, pleasant, and made us feel at home. We ate their continental breakfast and a dinner one night, and were very happy with the quality of the food. Walls were a little thin, but nothing close to unbearable. They put us in a room right next to the (small 4 person) elevator, which was a non-issue as well. Communication via email was excellent leading up to our arrival. There are some stores and a few restaurants in walking distance to nearby Hayes Street, although I did get some feedback from locals that the area could be a little \"sketchy\" at times (we had no issues). The parking was $25/night which is a little pricey for my taste, but is definitely the going rate in SF. You can try to find street parking across from the hotel if you're lucky (but be sure to ask about street cleaning days). There are no kid specific activities or areas, but if you're a parent traveling with kids my guess is that you'll already be plenty prepared with things brought from home to keep them occupied. :) Nothing fancy, but the little things they did made our stay enjoyable.

I was clear that I was traveling with a friend, and we definitely needed two beds, or a bed with sleep sofa. Miguel, the manager at SFW, told me he'd spoken to the Inn management and they could provide a rollaway bed. I had been told we had a \"Studio\" room reserved, with mini-fridge,microwave, and coffeepot. So off we went, excited to be spending 2 days in a new part of town and in a property I'd not seen before. When we arrived, the staff at Inn at the Opera stored our bags until the room was ready. They told me they did not have an available room with a sleep sofa, or with 2 double beds, but did have rollaway beds, and once again, I stressed to them that we definitely needed 2 beds. My friend and I went off to find lunch and adventure, and came back shortly after three PM to check into our room. At the desk, I asked about the rollaway bed. The desk clerk told me that, sadly, they had given out the last one, but that the bed would be comfortable for both of us. When I asked why a rollaway wasn't held for us, as the reservation had been made on Thursday, 2 days before, he told us that no matter when it's reserved, it's on a first come, first served basis. After a hurried consultation at the desk, my friend and I went to look at the room, to see if we could survive the next 2 days comfortably. What a shock when we walked into the room. The bellman who brought our luggage up could barely get all 4 suitcases in the room. The overall room size, including the bathroom, narrow entrance hall, and \"kitchenette\"(a microwave and coffeeepot on a shelf over a mini-frig, no counter or work space), was barely 160 s.f. There was a full-size bed (measured it...certainly wasn't a queen) and one small 24\" round table jammed into a corner with a big lamp sitting on it and a chair in front of it. Other than that and the bed, no place to sit, no room to swing a cat! And even a mid-afternoon on a sunny day, with all the lights on, the room was distressingly dark. Even if I were traveling alone, I would not have stayed in that room. While I've traveled throughout Europe and understand the concept (and size and scale)of a European style hotel, that room was just...sad. Twenty minutes later I had booted up my laptop, logged onto priceline, and found a four-star (The Omni Hotel, on California St in the Financial District) for $130 per night. I called downstairs for the bellman again, and when I checked out, I asked the front desk clerk where he was planning on putting the rollaway bed if one had been available, and he admitted that they knew there was no place in that room to put one. I think that was the most infuriating part of the whole situation for me. Not only had they misled and outright lied to me, but they also jeopardized the reputation of Miguel at SFW by allowing him to promise something they had never any intention of delivering. Away we went. Twenty minutes later we were ensconced in a very beautiful and spacious room at the Omni with two queen size beds, a large desk, a table and easy chair, and plenty of light.

I needed a hotel that met my company expense account requirements (not easy in San Francisco), especially during the weekend of the SF Marathon. When a Holiday Inn room in SF is priced at $279 a night, you know it\u2019s going to be a challenge to find anything decent, but by booking 6 weeks in advance I was able to secure a room at Inn at the Opera for $124 a night before tax, Ballet studio using my AAA membership rate. The Inn at the Opera Building is a narrow 7 story building right next to the San Francisco Ballet building on Franklin and Fulton streets. The hotel lobby is not big, but the hotel photos reflect it accurately. Continue walking straight past the front desk and you will see a small business center with computer and printer, and then the Ovation restaurant and bar in the back. This is where the continental breakfast was served each morning and it opens for dinner at night. I had read other Tripadvisor reviews that mentioned how small the Ballet studio could be and how some did not have a desk or sitting area. I called and then e-mailed about a week out to request a Ballet suite with a desk. I\u2019m glad I did because while the room was smaller (about 200 sf) it did have everything I needed including a nice built in kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, sink, dishes, wine glasses, flatware and cups as well as a coffeemaker. The room had a flat panel screen TV-it looked like it was about 27\u201d, but adequate with a DVD player. There was also a nice sized armoire to hold hanging suits as well as 3 large drawers for clothing. The bed was very comfortable with very nice soft linens and pillows. The towels in the bathroom were also very plush. The Inn appears to have about 14 rooms per floor. It looks like the Ballet studio can vary from reasonable to one \u201cHotwire\u201d level room tucked towards the back of the building. This must be the one others on this site have complained about as it looked tiny. I think my room; Room 26 was a medium sized ballet studio. The hotel website shows a ballet suite with a nice couch and bay windows-if this is so, I was not offered one of those. I have attached a floor plan to this review so that you can see how the floors actually layout. You will see the only 2 rooms on the whole floor are the same room represented as a \u201cBallet Suite\u201d on their website. The hotel was sold out that weekend, but service didn\u2019t seem to suffer at all. The staff are very nice and competent-Jesse at the Front desk deserves recognition for how helpful and polite he always was. His attitude is a great reflection on the Inn. This place is truly a small boutique style Inn. It is not a 4 or 5 star hotel. It is more of a 3- star place, as the furniture while nice is a little dated to the 80\u2019s The elevator many complained about is indeed small-about the size of a coat closet, with a door you have to open manually so that you can get in the elevator cab. Some may find this charming, but it\u2019s more of an annoyance if you are trying to get your bags in while balancing the door. This hotel reminds me of an old Town or University club, with furnishings you might see in your grandmothers house-nicely cared for but a little worn. There were lots of Europeans there when I stayed there. They seemed to overtake the continental breakfast buffet so I would just take a plate up to my room each morning. The buffet has sliced melon, bagels, cream cheese, boiled eggs, cottage cheese and English muffins. It could use some cold cuts or cheeses. In summary, for the price it is a bargain but also bear in mind that you get what you pay for. The fact that it was close to the BART /Airport train, the Muni, and the other places I needed to go around City Hall made it very convenient. By the way, for many years I would rent a car in SF and pay the ridiculous parking charges. Once I got to know the BART and Muni routes there was no reason to have a car-the public transport options in San Francisco are just fantastic. I bought a 7 day \u201cPassport\u201d pass that is good on the Muni, Cable Cars, etc. It will get you anywhere you need to go, and you can buy them at City Hall on the first floor, or at the Powell/Market Muni station. Their website is www.SFMuni.com if you want to check it out. Here are my likes and dislikes of Inn at the Opera: \u201cLikes\u201d Coffee and Wet Bar in Room Good towels Continental Breakfast Free newspapers (except Sunday) Hotel staff Location-great SF neighborhood Relative ease getting from SFO airport via BART Housekeeping is excellent Pretty fast taxi service-via front desk phone call \u201cDislikes\u201d Circa 1996 Third world country Internet speeds if it connects at all Hotel not entirely forthcoming about what \u201cBallet\u201d suites really are Check-out time of 11:00 am Alley or no view from a majority of the rooms Extremely narrow and dark hallways and ancient elevator Disappearing doorman/valet (rarely saw them) Poor television reception TV remotes didn\u2019t work Very poor air ventilation/circulation in the hotel No pool or fitness area or alternatives in the neighborhood Having stayed primarily at 4 or 5 star hotels on Nob Hill, Union Square or the Financial District during past stays in SF, I would say this was a decent alternative, because the location was convenient to where I needed to be. But I would not consider it a 4 star hotel. The facility is 3 stars and the staff makes it 3-1/2, in my opinion. Just be sure to call them to know exactly what you are booking or you may be very disappointed. They should really do a better job of posting pictures of all possible Ballet studio options, rather than that of the bay windowed one with the couch.

There is a very small fridge and microwave with plates, silverware and dishes which is nice. Its an older property so the rooms are small but have a lot of character. Shower is great with plenty of water pressure and hot water. The beds are very comfy and the towels are big and fluffy. The complimentary continental breakfast is really only so-so. If I was only here a few days it probably would have been great but after a few weeks I was willing to pay for other options just for variety. Juice, coffee/tea, english muffins, bagels, melon, hard-boiled eggs and cold cereal pretty much sum it up. They put signs up saying to limit your breakfast to 30mins when the property is busy?? That did not feel friendly but it does get crowded on weekends. I did not eat dinner in the restaurant but the room service menu was reasonably priced and the onion soup is excellent!! I liked the rooms facing the front of the hotel- great views and much quieter than the ones on the corner- not sure why but the street noise is louder on the corners. There is no air conditioning and some rooms have ceiling fans and some don't. In July its actually quite cool (60s- low 70s) so I was not needing it at all.

There are a lot of reviews for Inn at the Opera and they were mostly positive, so I booked one of the small \"Ballet\" rooms. I was a little concerned when I realized that this hotel was part of the dreaded \"time-share\" system, but there was absolutely no sign of it when we checked in and not a hint of anything in the way of a sales pitch. The accomodations were modest, but well-maintained and spotlessly clean. The room of course was very small, but we did not plan to spend much time in the room since we were sightseeing. The hotel has an old-world charm about it and it felt very comfortable. Every staff member that we had contact with was pleasant and helpful. The breakfast that came with the room was good, but basic - coffee, juice, muffins, some fresh fruit, and cottage cheese and a few other things. The location is great - very close to the Civic Center with all its attractions. Davies symphony Hall is literally right around the corner. We needed to open the windows to get the room to a comfortable temperature and became aware of quite a bit of noise from outside, but no more than could be expected at the center of the city, and it quieted down a lot fairly early in the evening. We did a lot of walking around and never felt any sense of uneasiness. There was a lot of pedestrian traffic and many restaurants close by (we enjoyed the Hayes Street Grill).

A couple of them really helpful with storing my bags. \u2022 Not much street noise for central San Francisco. Less Good \u2022 Very few facilities nearby (restaurants, cafes) \u2022 Internet very slow and typically dropped a couple of times per hour (gets very frustrating!) \u2022 No desk or chair in the room \u2013 difficult to do much work. After 4 days my back is suffering from typing on the couch. \u2022 A limited number of TV channels and about half of them with no reception. Watching TV not much of an option. \u2022 Small bathroom and especially small shower. \u2022 5 block walk to Market Street and then need to use public transport to get anywhere. \u2022 Kept waiting 50 minutes for check-in and given \u201cexcuses\u201d (some of the reasons given were clearly lies designed to pacify me \u2013 of course they did the opposite) for why room not ready.

After 2 days I started to take breakfast out and that felt a lot better. The hotel dining room is dark with no natural light. \u2022 Banging from the room above me as they walk around (sounds like wooden floors) and I can clearly hear them take a shower. \u2022 Room stuffy with old / dated hotel smell (not unbearable, but not a smell I would chose).

Even though the staff have changed, including several managers, the current establishment is better than ever. The location, just steps from the Opera House, allows for a different vantage point to explore, other than Union Square or Nob Hill. The convenience for musical performances is such that we were in our fifth-floor room and could still see patrons filing out for several more minutes! For those staying two or more nights, the relatively new Asian Arts Museum is only three blocks away (Michelin gives it three stars in the Green Guide to SF). Surely one cannot dispute the compact rooms, though some appear more spacious. But if guests can leave behind huge foot lockers, everything can fit. My wife and I both like space but were not disappointed at the dimensions of the rooms. If street noise bothers light sleepers, I would recommend bringing along earplugs just to be sure. Firm beds are fine for the posture and there is little or no noise from adjoining rooms. Yes, breakfasts can be a bit repetitious but do provide adequate sustenance. I did suggest that supplemental items be on a menu to provide for greater variety. This would generate income for the hotel and at the same time provide speciatly items. Freshly baked cookies and a bowl of red and green apples are perfect for a welcoming snack. A microwave and small fridge are signs that some of the units are available for time-share considerations. The SF Chronicle is also complimentary. But it is the management and staff who will endear one to the inn. With a \"no challenge too great\" attitude, guests feel part of a family rather than an impersonal institution. Even the cleaning staff have been trained to relate well with guests. Impressive! Restaurants still abound and many have been around for ten years or more. A new chef at Absinthe brings greater variety; La Jardini\u00e8re now offers a bar menu (no reservations for this section); Caffe Della Stelle offers inexpensive Italian food; Hayes Street Grill still wows with its fresh, good fish at moderate prices. The front desk will be more than happy to arrange reservations, but I would recommend making pre-concert bookings well in advance. The Inn at the Opera has been around many years. It appears that the only major changes have been the professional and courteous attitude of the staff.

We had reserved two rooms: a ballet for my father in-law and his wife, and an opera for us, family of 4 with teenagers. I called the hotel previously and to let them know we would be arriving late, and Javier was most kind. Upon entering, the hotel seems very small from the outside, but as soon as you enter you get this European feel of a turn of the century mansion. It is beautifuly decorated and also has a restaurant, but did not use it. Our room was great! We had a master bedroom with ensuite bathroom, a small dining table with 3 chairs, a kitchenette (microwave, fridge, coffe maker w/coffe, sink) and plenty of tableware for the whole family. It also had a sitting area with a sofa sleeper where my teenage daughters slept and another HUGE bathroom, which was very nice to have, so that we could all get ready in the morning faster. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and really get out of their way to make you feel welcome. They offered us fresh warm cookies and fresh apples whenever we wanted them. When we checked in, I requested extra towels, pillows, a fan and ice, and they were delivered in less than 10 minutes, and it was midnight! Great service. My in-laws were given a room a little small for their comfort, and next morning when we talked to Javier at the front desk, we were told they would change them to a larger one, and not to worry about the luggage (many!), that they would move it while we went on a tour all day long. They indeed did so and moved all my in-laws luggage to the new larger room and when we arrived that night, they were given new keys and everything was taken care of and they went straight to their new room and found all their belongings in order. My in-laws were very happy with the change. It was done in a smooth way and Javier always made us feel welcome and went out if his way to please our needs. Again, excelent service! Included in the rate was a continental breakfast, which is served in the restaurant area and it includes juices, milk, cereals, pastries, hard boiled eggs, yogurt and fresh fruit. Some people complain the hotel is not in the middle of the city, but it is just one block from the beautiful City Hall, and the the hop-on hop-off tour bus has a stop right in front of the hotel, which saved us a ton of money on cabs since these buses run every 20 minutes sharp and go all around the city center.

There is a sitting room with French doors, a sofa bed & small plasma TV & a second private bathroom off the sitting room. The foyer doubles as a kitchenette with bar sink, very small micro., bar frig, plates, cups, glasses, cutlery for 4, wine, bottle/can openers, large knife, dish clothes and liquid & a coffee maker. Coffee packets are supplied each day as is maid service. There are 2 built-in closets, one in the bedroom, the other in the sitting room. The suite is set up to accommodate 4. It is spacious for 2. We are in an end unit which is very quiet except for the occassional siren. The Continental breakfast is the same each day with the only variation in the flavor of the large muffins. There are 2 cereals - Cheerios and corn flakes - hard cooked eggs in their shells & not rubbery, sliced melons & bananas, cottage & cream cheeses, bagels, tomatoes, yogurt, coffee & o.j. Mid-afternoon there are warm cookies; and apples are always available. We had Valentine's Day dinner in the hotel's French restaurant Ovations where breakfast is served. Dinner was excellent! We had duck breast and duck leg confit which was delicious and authentically prepared. A real surprise. The house Pinot was also very good. As written by others, the IATO is in the heart of the performing arts venues. Our room overlooks the SF Ballet. The IATO is also convenient to public transport. We left our rental car at SFO, caught the AirTrain to SFO BART to the Civic Center, exit the BART on 8th St. It takes half an hour on the BART from SFO & costs $8.10 p.p. We will return to SFO the same way. The Civic Center BART is a few blocks from IATO. Care should be taken after dark around the Civic Center. There are many reasonable restaurants near the IATO, as well as Absynthe, a French restaurant. As walkers, the location is not as convenient to tourist venues as other hotels but is quieter. Taking the Muni to Bernal Heights took half an hour but walking back only took 45 min. plus a stop for Turkish coffee at Philz; so for walkers, the location is fine. The staff is very friendly and helpful, whether the desk staff or the cleaning personnel. The desk staff has a list of restaurants that will deliver to your room, although Ovations provides room service. Our room was refreshed daily with mid-week sheet change. If there is anything negative, it might be the cost of parking at $25 a day & no on-site exercise facility.

This is a \"boutique\" hotel, where the elevator only fits up to 4 people at a time, there is no air conditioning or heat in the rooms and the view is of an alleyway and fire escape. There are no restaurants near by and it pretty much forces you into dining at their restaurant \"Ovation\"... needless to say they didn't get a standing ovation from us. When entering the restaurant we were asked if we had reservations, we said no, and the waiter grudgingly seated us even though there were only two other tables. The food was scarce (half the menu available and SMALL portions) at $35 a plate, when leaving we left a cash tip on the table to the waiter who had checked on us one time during the course of our meal and frequently took plates before we were finished... upon checkout he had attached an additional $40 tip for himself to our bill.

It is the Symphony - one bedroom with queen bed and living room with pullout sofa. Both pretty small. Nice large bathroom. More than adequate space for two, pushing it but adequate for four. If you are expecting to spend a lot of time in the hotel in San Francisco, this isn't the place. It is a boutique hotel with a small lobby. The bar closes at 9:00pm. If you are here to see the sights and don't mind going to the bar around the corner, it is a great place. What makes this a special place for me are three things. 1. The staff is among the friendliest and most gracious and helpful you will ever meet. They really go out of their way to be helpful. And the Inn takes care of small things. Have you noticed that lately hotels are cutting back on little things like conditioner or lotion? Sometimes they only give you one set whether you are there for a day or a week. The Inn has a complete set and refreshes every day - it is so nice to know that I don't have to pack that! The rooms are spotless and serviced every day - normal for a hotel, unusual for a timeshare. It looks like time for a new paint job but the furniture is still very good since the last update. Beds are very comfortable - the pullout sofa is no better than the usual - wouldn't want to have to sleep on it for more than a couple of days. 2. The continental breakfast (comes with the room) is really excellent. Unlimited coffee, orange juice, tea, bagels, boiled eggs, cereal, muffins, English muffins, fruit, and a couple of toasters. It is served in a room that is the Ovations Restaurant at night. In my years owning at I at O, the restaurant has gone through various ownerships. It is never bad and often good, and it is nice to have available if you don't want to go out. Unusually, the menu for room service is less costly than the menu for the restaurant. I have never had the food served in the room, so cannot comment on timeliness or taste.. The kitchen, as others have noted, is minimalist. Good for saving leftovers and sandwich fixings - not to mention wine and beer. There are many good restaurants within easy walking distance - both on Van Ness and down in the upandcoming Hayes Valley area. Apples and cookies are served daily and there is usually a concierge onsite. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful and can direct you to where you want to go, even if the concierge is not there. A lovely new feature is free inroom wifi. Printing and fax is available downstairs as well as a computer, all for a fee. Good for boarding passes. 3. The best part for me, of course, is proximity to the opera, Davies Symphony Hall, and Herbst theater. I go to San Francisco specifically for these and love the fact that I only have to walk across the street at night when the concerts are done. However, a bonus is that buses run up Van Ness (one block over) to take you to Fisherman's Wharf, along McAllister (one block up) to take you to Golden Gate Park, and the BART station is about four blocks down to take you to both airports, Powell, Street , and the Embarcadero. The Asian Art Museum is a couple of blocks away, as is the Civic Center and a Broadway style theater. Parking is pricey - I either fly in or park at an outlying BART station and take BART. You can buy BART tickets online (BART.gov) and senior tickets are about a fourth to a third of full price there.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGoing to the opera in San Francisco?

When we told them everything spoiled, they didn't do anything to make amends.

From the minute I arrived, I felt welcomed!

The customer service star from that day forward was Rowena who anticipated my every need and treated me like royalty. When I overflowed the tub, fresh towels were at my door within minutes. When I was too tired to go out, I got take out and room service menus. And after arranging my airport shuttle for my early morning departure, she made a point to say goodbye since she would not be on duty when I left. How sweet is that! The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Huge baths have plush robes and there is a small but functional kitchenette with place settings for four. The mini-fridge was perfect for keeping my ferry market purchases and chilling wine. My room had only two windows, but plenty of lighting. I did hear some sirens (a fire station is nearby) but otherwise the room was quiet. Being in a metro area, I would expect some street noise like this. Although I travel with a noise cancelling device, I never had to use it here. The location is fairly convenient to public transport with a main line 2 blocks away on Van Ness and another about 5 blocks away on Market. Cabs are available by phone (which the front desk staff happily arrange) and arrive within 10 minutes or so. They have free internet and a computer near the lobby with a printer for boarding passes, maps, etc. Not exactly a business center, but adequate and accessible 24/7. Not much to do/see in the immediate area except the Opera/Ballet which I did attend. Everything else is a 10-20 minute cab ride or tram away. I paid about $10 per trip for taxis and the three day transport pass for the rest was $18 and available for purchase at the city hall 1 \u00bd blocks away.

Apples were always available in a bowl on the sideboard by the elevator and fresh cookies were made every day at 3:00. I did not eat in the restaurant during my stay.

When I was planning a two-day museum trip in the city, I check out Trip Advisor and read several warnings regarding the management and their tendency to change up the reservations. With this warning in mind, I booked an Opera Suite Room and emailed the manager to obtain, in writing, confirmation that I had booked and reserved said Opera Suite. Confirmation promptly arrived by email. When we arrived, we met with the following: \"Hmm, I don't see your booking for the Opera Suite. I will call Javier (the same person who confirmed the booking by email) for further direction...please have a seat in the lobby.\" After 10 min. of lobby simmering, I asked what she was authorized to do to accommodate us, as clearly, there was a problem that was not being solved. She offered us the Symphony Suite with complimentary parking. We accepted, as we had dinner plans in an hour, went to our room, took showers and then the same desk clerk showed up at the door to announce that Javier said we could either move to an Opera Suite (that miraculously had become available) or continue with our present arrangements with complimentary parking. We stayed put as we had to leave for dinner and were in robes. Argh! On the positive side: very quiet, great central location, excellent parking valet services, and everybody was very polite. It seems that the IATO, both a hotel and a time-share, has ongoing issues with ensuring reservations. Perhaps the time-share owners' bookings take precedence over the standard reservations?

Next time I will probably opt for a different place downtown and take a cab or the BART. The location is great for the Opera, Ballet, Symphony, or Conservatory events, but it is a bit isolated. Unless there is a show, hardly any people are around in that area after 5 or 6. Given that there are security guards at the Conservatory (a few blocks away) who won't let you into the facility unless someone says you have official business there, I gather that the area isn't all that safe. There are a couple of blocks of good (independently owned) restaurants and shops nearby, but many of them close early, catering primarily to the pre-show crowd. I finished work late and had a very difficult time finding a place to eat around 10 pm, and room service was closed. The room was extremely small with a very small closet for storing clothes (no dresser), and no place to put luggage. There was a microwave and fridge, which was convenient, but they were both a little beat up, as was the structure that held them--it was falling apart. The entire time I was there, the wi-fi was not in service, which was extremely frustrating, given that I was there to work. The staff did offer use of a computer downstairs, but everything I needed was on my laptop. Also, there was no desk or chair in my room, which meant that I had to work on my bed or at a nearby cafe. Breakfast was included, and is served in a plush dining room. The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. Inn at the Opera reminded me of many hotels in Europe--very small rooms and elevator, limited room service, things not working, and plush old-world decor.

What I got was a GREAT deal on a FANTASTIC room at the Inn at the Opera. Then I Yelped it for results as you never know exactly what you're going to get when you do a Hotwire booking . I trust the reviews on this site over those of the booking site any day. Larry, Ed to the M and Gourmet were right on target with thier ratings - the Inn at the Opera pretty much rocks. Easy to find (for someone with limited knowledge of San Francisco) the Inn is located in a nice safe, very clean area. You can even avoid the overnight parking fee if the Parking Karmaforce is with you and you happen to score one of the street parking slots. It's located within steps of the stunning Opera house (I'm not even a fan of Opera - but the building is an architectural glory). The Inn itself is beautifully appointed, the staff was exceptionally prompt, curteous & very sincere. One of the things I appreciated most was the fact that they didn't look down their noses at me for being a \"Pre Pay\" and showing up in hoodie and baseball cap direct from my tow-in surf session (as some staffers at other properties have when I've stayed in the Nob Hill section of SF). My room, though small, was very well appointed and comfy. In fact, I slept too well, I snoozed right through the free breakfast on Sunday (I should have asked what sort of mattress' they use as my bed was heavenly ) About the only suggestion I could make for the room was some sort of bed tray for working on my laptop as there was no desk space. But the wireless worked well, there was a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, a plush terry robe, lots of hot water (love my super long hot showers) and plenty of fresh white towels. This property would make for a sweet romantic weekend getaway, a nice place to stay on business, or, as in my case, a great place to call home when mixing business with pleasure - not sure how well it would work for families though due to space constrictions. I will definitely be booking back at the Inn at the Opera for my future stays - even if I can't score the 50% discount by booking online through Hotwire (59 bucks per night - down from $120.00+) .", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Service\u201d", "Author": "MontrealMaria52", "ReviewID": "UR28433598", "Content": "If you are thinking about coming to San Francisco consider the Inn at the Opera.

Only advice to Inn at the Opera is to get CNN on their TV system rather than that horrid Fox News channel. Providing free internet for guests in the lobby would also enhance the services provided.

It is an all suite property right off Civic Center, War Memorial Opera House and Symphony Hall in the posh Hayes Valley area. Welcome area and lounge area are decorated in classic tone and completely charming boutique feel from the beginning of the boutique hotel booms in the industry. The first staff I encountered at Front Desk was not uniformed when I arrived at a quarter past 1PM (a bit early for check-in but it was Sunday and the city is running lower occupancy in hotel industry, so I thought I could give it a try). Of course, the room/suite was not ready. I stored my belongings with the hotel and off my errands in the city. I was told that the room would be ready by 3PM. I returned to the hotel around 3:30PM and was given room 35 after 10 minutes wait by the Front Desk to get someone to acknowledge me. I got the key within one minute and off I went to the classic SF apartment cozy elevator. As I got off the elevator, I almost hit the robe (not sure if it is clean or not), hanging by the door that enters to the wing my room located. I carefully walk around it in the Hotel\u2019s narrow hallway. It indeed reminds me a bit like many of the city sponsored apartment buildings around SF, except the price tag for this hotel was way much higher. As I walked past an opened door with housekeeper inside to get to my room, I knew that my room would not be ready (this came from my experience working in Sales & Marketing department in a two major hotel chains in US for 10 years). The bed was not done and the room had a really bad odor. I turned around and went back to the Front Desk. This time, I was noticed right away. I informed the staff that the room given to me was not ready. They radioed the housekeeping department and I was told that the room was ready after they got the confirmation from housekeeping. I told the FD staff that the bed was not made so it could not possibly be clean and ready. One of the FD staff went into the office behind the desk and later I was given another room - Room 55 on 5th floor. This time I did not encounter the dirty linen hanging from the door and did not notice any housekeepers on this floor. I got into the STUDIO and was really shocked. The kitchenette area was efficiently in front of the door. To the right, there was the bed that I would be crashed for the 2 nights. There was no working area or desk. The tiny night stand houses an old lamp, the house phone, standard hotel radio/alarm and a pile of magazines/hotel information directory (I gathered as I did not want to get more shocks with the 3.5 star hotel accommodations). The armoire right in front of the bed has a VCR-TV combo, few drawers and hangers. There was no safe deposit that could be found as most 2-5 star hotels would have across US. The iron and iron board are tugged away next to the armoire and the mirror wall (YES, the mirror wall that can be found in some road-side motels often with a big billboard offering honeymoon suite by the hour!) On the other side of the bed is a classic armed-chair sits between the window (going out to the fire escape) leaving a bit of room for me to walk by. The studio is really tiny comparing to most hotel rooms I have seen in San Francisco (one of the hotel chains I worked was in the city) but this room is to suppose to be a STUDIO and the hotel names itself as a 3.5 star resort. I was truly disappointed but I told myself to make do since I am only staying two nights. I tried to put away my suitcase and all my belongings since there was not much room to walk around in the bedroom area. The armoire can\u2019t be opened all the way and hit the end of the bed when opens to 60 degree so I carefully tugged my bag in the armoire as well as the portable heater it was left in my room. The bathroom was decent size comparing to my sleeping quarter but I would only consider it was efficient not luxurious or nicely decorated. It does appear to be clean and everything seems to all attached, however, the rose color shower curtain stands way out in this all ivory/creamy colored bathroom. I looked again in the hotel\u2019s website and made sure that I was not making any mistakes on my research before booking the hotel. I found there is some rooms in the hotel SMALLER than mine, called Ballet Room for efficiency travelers (I however had hard-time to image any room smaller than mine). For my type of studio, it supposes to have two chairs and a desk or table according to the hotel\u2019s website. I told myself that there is no way, the hotel can even try to put in another chair or a desk/table and still advertises this studio as comfortable for two people. I pulled over a pillow as my desk on the bed and sat on the one and only chair to make it work as working area. The resort/hotel is not deserved 3.5 star as I have seen 2.5 and 3 star hotel in the city that are more spacious, clean and well d\u00e8cored. I don\u2019t know how the hotel pulled together to get the star rating from AAA and passed the standards as required. Shell Hospitality managed a few great resorts so I was really disappointed that this hotel can be part of Shell\u2019s world of elegant resorts and vacation homes. The rate for the studio was low but I know that I can get some other hotels with less star rating but more comfortable setting for travelers.

The bathroom is also very nice, but there wasn't much space to store my cosmetics, so I ended up putting some of my stuff on the floor.

Where I come from there is no way you can find such a great price on a good hotel; especially one that offers such a nice complimentary breakfast. The resturant downstairs called Ovation is soooo good. I highly reccomend trying the creme brulee. It's out-of-this-world! The service from the maids is great. However, I was dissapointed when we were told our room would be ready by 3:00pm but it was not ready until after 4:30. That had me quite upset because we were wasting precious time in SF. Also, the hotel is not located within walking distane to any attractions, so that made traveling kind of difficult. We rented cabs for the most part, and the hotel was very good about calling cabs for us. Overall, The Inn at the Opera is a great place to stay with good food and service at a great value.

We reported this & they brought 2 PORTABLE HEATERS to the room(this made us believe that this was a known problem to them). We thought we'll make do with this.Wrong. While ironing our clothes the electricity \"tripped\" in the room since apparently their system was obviously overloaded.We were left in the dark & cold. We tried to make do & reported this the next day. They came but did nothing & basically left us with the portable heaters again. To make a long story short we tolerated this for FIVE NIGHTS & then they offered to move us to a similar room when those residents left since they said it'll take a while to correct the problem.The move was good (to the 6th floor)but by this time I was personally fed up.While we were on the 6th floor, we heard residents in the room we vacated the same day & which was right above us!Obviously they didn't fix anything, so as I said before, it seems that the problems are pre-existing & they just don't fix it. For the nightly rate charged one should not have to tolerate this.Like one of the viewers said there's a \"tip\" bill folder for the \"complimentary breakfast\" which they presented with alacrity each day.
