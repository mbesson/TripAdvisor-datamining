The breakfast was wonderful and the staff there were so friendly. The front dest staff were nice as well. They even kept our luggage for us on our last day so we could explore a bit more. The one con that ruined the stay for us and we will NOT stay here again is: we discovered that at some point while our car was with the valets (this hotel only has valet parking at $32 a day!) one of them stole all the quarters out of my coin drawer in the car. It's not the money that bothers me the most but the dishonesty of handing my car over to strangers and having them steal from me! And we tipped there jerks, too!

Location: Excellent. The hotel is 2 blocks from the bustling center of activity in the Inner Harbor (near the USS Constellation) and a block from the Charles Center Metro Subway stop (exit Calvert Street). There's a supermarket 3 blocks away (north) on Charles Street, a pharmacy half a block away, a convenience store across the street. Room: Very good. The 1 bedroom studio was very comfortable and clean with modern amenities including two LCD TVs and a kitchen with stove, full size refrigerator with ice maker, dishwasher and a full set of dishware for four, and pots/pans and covered storage containers. There is a small dining table with chairs for two. I cooked on most nights and cleaned up but found that housekeeping was very attentive, sometimes even running my few remaining dishes and my through the dishwasher for me. The workspace was adequate with a full table next to electrical outlets and the room had both wired and wireless connections (included in the room charge as usual for Residence Inn). Internet speed was a little slow averaging around 0.5 Mbps downstream. The bed was a little soft for my taste and wasn't the full luxurious bedding offered at the flagship Marriott hotels, but otherwise was comfortable. There was generous closet space and separate sink from the toilet and shower/bath. Bar/Restaurant: There is a small, pleasant bar/restaurant downstairs that offers specials on many nights of the week. I enjoyed a burger and sweet potato tots that were very good. Breakfast was offered (also included in room rate) in a separate downstairs area that sometimes became crowded at peak times. The selections were quite varied with scrambled eggs, a breakfast meat, some type of potatoes and another hot item (sometimes breakfast sandwiches, etc), a variety of yogurts, breads, and two DIY waffle makers. Apple, orange, and cranberry juice cocktail were all available. There was ample coffee in the breakfast area as well as coffee and hot water available 24 hours near the elevators. Awesome! Staff at the restaurants were very friendly and welcoming. Other amenities: Laundry room offered an ample number of modern front load washers and powerful dryers (able to dry two average sized wash loads in one machine on a single cycle). Quarters and detergent are available at the front desk for purchase. The exercise room was small but available 24 hours and had modern treadmills with individual TVs and a small selection of dumb bell free weights. Business center/library offers free laser printing. Safety: The hotel felt very safe and there were usually two door men present at the main entrance at all hours. The area immediately around the hotel also seemed fairly safe.

The free breakfast was one of the better ones that I have had at Residence Inn properties and the dining room staff was very attentive to both guests and availability of food and beverage.

My daughter went to Loyola and eventually stayed and works in Baltimore. We have stayed in many Hotels and The Residence Inn has far exceeded all of them, from 3 star to 5 star..I know I read one of the reviews where the poster says they never told her and her husband about the parking garage across the street for $9 instead of the hotels valet parking at $32 a day...They fixed that problem, ( probably due to that poster) When we arrived they told us about the garage across the street or their valet parking. And the price difference.We chose theirs... Check in was simple and easy... Walked into the room, it was huge, with a small kitchen, stove, dishwasher, reg. size frig, dishes, pots, pans, etc.... desk for work , table to eat, king size bed, sofa bed couch... Every immenity you could want ... Clean, Clean and Clean.Bed was comfortable, pillows too.... Then a hotel staffer calls and asks if everything went ok and if we were satisfiied,, Yes, of course we were... The location was 2 min. to the harbor, Dunkin Donuts outside the door to the right... Water st. wear there were cafes and jazz lounges aroung the corner... We went to Supranos on Water St. for a night cap and heard a great Jazz band before we went up for the night...food looked good, we had dessert and that was good... The hotel had a guests dog behind the front desk counter, so cute, because he howls and gets lonely, so the desk clerk, said it was a win win situation for both guest and hotel...We didnt take out pets there, but definetly will next time... A one time $100 fee for 2 dogs. They had a lobby restaurant with bar, a very comfortable sitting area with TV and about 3 or 4 computers and a printer. A free coffee station and what I loved because I had my mom who didnt want to join us for dinner, they had a little store with soup and microwavable foods. I thought that was great... I did inquire about more than a few night stays, since my daughter and her husband do live there and will eventually have children. they did say that there is a discount for long length stays...

The hotel provides a fantastic hot breakfast buffet in the morning- one of the best I have ever seen at this class hotel. We ate dinner in the 17 Restaurant- the food was good, but service was rather slow. If you are in a hurry, this may not be the place to eat. The only negative was the cost of valet parking- rather steep but parking is limited in the downtown area so we chose to utilize it.

I asked if there were any rooms with a nice view and was told \"no\" but that our room had one of the better views as it was a corner. We explained that we were using a Marriott gift card to pay for the stay and the clerk consulted with another employee with our gift card in hand. When we checked out the next morning, we were told there would be a hold on our American Express for the entire amount for 5 days. (We did call the manager later in the day and had the hold withdrawn, but how ridiculous when we were essentially paying cash.) The carpets in the hall are a very busy, ugly pattern. Our room was dark and dreary with brick walls and roofs the view from every window. The mattress was very hard and unyielding. The dining chairs are too low for the table height. We didn't experience breakfast as we had to leave by 6 in the morning. I wish I had stayed at Henderson's Wharf as the price would have been the same as the Residence Inn because parking is free there.

Very convenient to most of the inner harbor, water taxi, and convention center. Unlike other hotels co-workers were at, the internet was free. Parking (not used) was $32 as I recall, expensive, but then real estate is had to come by. They had two elevators, so wait time was minimal, even during the morning rush. The central air conditioning was very good, not too loud and kept the rooms at a constant temperature. Rooms were quiet, and isolated from inside noise although the sirens from outside penetrated the windows (double pane). First room was good, kitchen had what I needed to prepare a meal with food I brought (which was good after a three hour flight delay and being 8PM). Radio did not work but the alarm did. Second room had a bad odor like the rug was just chemically cleaned, left the windows open all day and that took care of the problem. The radio worked, but reception was poor. If you desire, you can put a sign out and housekeeping will not disturb your room, which is good if you have work materials spread out for easy access throughout the day. For folks who like to do radio ops, the two rooms I was in appeared to be RF shielded, very poor reception inside and unable to get out with 5 watt VHF/UHF. The building was recently renovated, but there were signs of age, a cracked sink, windows hard to use. I had a one bedroom suite which would have been OK for two, but iffy for three since the closet was small and the bathroom was off of the bedroom. Lighting was ok, but mostly floor lamps except for the kitchen and bathroom areas. In the first room I had to clean the kitchen counter. Staff was friendly and helpful, but the desk was undermanned for a hotel this size. There were several computers in the small business \"center\" that allowed you to print out thumbdrives or to access the internet to be able to print items on a laserjet. When I saw Housekeeping in the hall they wanted to service the room even though I was good with it the way it was, but they were very nice and helpful. Breakfast was a bit above average, with the standard scrambled eggs, a meat, and a potato, some fresh fruit, yogurts, juices, hot and cold cereals, etc. and a special item like biscuit or muffin sandwich, eggs Florentine, or french toast for my stay. Staff was very helpful if you asked for something not out, one of the better breakfast staffing I have seen in a while.

Modern efficient lobby. Our room was absolutely spectacular. Our room actually had a view of the masts of the USS Constellation between two of the city buildings, but the view is otherwise NOT an Inner Harbor view (at least from the 9th floor). The design was stunning, from the carpet to the wall coverings to the furniture. My 16 year old daughter, a fan of shows like Design Star, was especially fond of the upholstered chair and its very cool fabric. Bathroom and kitchen are similarly well appointed, with granite all around. Bag of microwave popcorn waiting for you when you arrive.

As for the hotel itself, we got a good rate for our visit, and were upgraded from a studio suite to a suite with two rooms. It's nice having a full-size refrigerator, complete set of dishes, microwave, etc., in your room. Since the hotel is downtown, it can get a little noisy at night with sirens, etc. The air conditioning wasn't working properly in the first room we were given. Several maintenance men looked at it and assured us it was working properly and would cool our room off, but we were skeptical and asked to be switched to another room, which was much more comfortable. One of the reasons we stayed at this hotel was because of the free hot breakfast included with our room. However, both mornings we waited until 30 or minutes or so before breakfast was done being served and found the dining room to be quite crowded, with a line going out of the door and into the hallway on our second morning there. They were running out of staples like eggs, etc., although the staff was doing its best to replenish the items as quickly as possible. But it was a bit chaotic. My suggestion would be to get up earlier and get down to breakfast before it gets too crowded! While we did have a HD flat-screen TV in both of our rooms, only one remote control worked.

I apologize in advance that this is so lengthy. Positives: Staff was friendly and welcoming. They were responsive to our concerns (see Negatives below). Our room was made up as requested on our reservation. The valet parking, although pricey, was offset by the reasonable price for the room and our vehicle always arrived quickly.Very busy breakfast areas, but the staff really hustled to keep items stocked. Plenty of typical \"free breakfast\" choices but each day something different was offered. Negatives: We have stayed at many Marriott Hotels and Residence Inns. This hotel is 2 blocks from the Inner Harbor. We felt safe walking around during the day, but it was a little sketchy at night. Also, we had several issues during our stay: 1.) Room had an odor that we couldn't put our finger on. Old garlic? Bad chinese food? Previous guest's cooking or someone from another room? It lingered and wouldn't go away. Room was adequately clean. We talked to the front desk the following day & they showed us and offered us another room, but it also had some of the same odor & the hassle of moving everything just wasn't worth it. After 3 days in the hotel we surmised it was coming up the elevator shaft from the cooking area/restaurant downstairs because sometimes it seemed worse in the hallway. We just closed our door fast when we got to the room to limit the smell coming in. 2.) When we opened the extra bedding to make up the pull out sofa, the blanket was visibly soiled and unwashed (gross). We contacted the front desk who apologized profusely, offered us additional Marriott Reward points, and within minutes another blanket (new in package) was brought to our room. 3.) Child sleeping in pullout was cold, so we requested an additional blanket the next night. When we returned from our day of sightseeing, another \"quilt\" had been tossed on our bed. When child went to spread on their bed, they shouted \"GROSS\": again, this item was also visibly soiled and unwashed. We again called the front desk. They had another new blanket brought to the room right away and asked that we show the soiling to the housekeeping staff and that person would be showing it to the manager. Again, big apology & more Marriott points. 4.) Around 2:45 a.m. second night of our stay, kids heard a man in hall, outside our door, singing and talking to himself. Person then started banging on our door, trying to use a key to open our door, yelling. It was terrifying! I called the front desk and asked if there was security on staff & explained situation. Was told that it must be the same guest who had been drunk and singing in the lobby before getting on elevator (not very comforting to hear!). We requested that someone come up immediately to take care of situation. We barely slept the rest of the night. 5:) Next day, we returned from sight seeing around 2:00 p.m. and found our room open (swing latch was moved so room door wouldn't close and latch). We had gone back to the harbor that morning. Our older child stayed behind and had requested maintenance come to the room due to a plumbing issue and then left to meet the rest of the family at 12:30. Room was unmade and no housekeeping was near our room to give us impression they were working in room. Our child was certain they had closed door securely. My husband called to complain to hotel manager (really-we had hit our limit)!. Manager came to our room right away, We didn't find anything stolen. The hotel manager listened to our numerous issues during our stay and did work with us to compensate our family for all the turmoil.

The hotel is what's best about the Residence Inn chain from Marriott: well designed hotels, competent and helpful staff, in great locations for travelers. This hotel is in the Inner Harbor district of Baltimore with an easy 3 block walk to the Inner Harbor and its many attractions. It is also right on/near two routes of the Charm City Circulator, the free bus service that is a real gift for tourists. Across the street from the hotel is a 7-Eleven, a block away is a CVS with a good selection of food and drinks, and there are several restaurants in the area including on at the hotel. The hotel is a high rise with15 floors with an exercise room and guest laundry on the 2nd floor and a business center on the 1st floor. Although the hotel serves the usual buffet breakfast in the 1st floor Hearth Room, we tend to be cereal eaters so our trips usually include a trip to the local convenience store for cereal, milk, bottled water, and other stuff. With the convenient stores in the area that was a breeze. The first floor also featured an Express Market which sold snacks and drinks. The rooms were compactly designed as is often the case in an urban hotel. Our 1 bedroom suite included a bedroom with an in suite bathroom and sliding door closet with ample hangers, an iron and ironing board, a queen size bed, 2 nightstands, a dresser holding a 37\" LCD LG TV, and a clock radio. The room was snug, but comfortable, with plenty of pillows and an extra blanket if needed. The bed was comfortable and the pillows actually had some fluff in them. If we had one minor complaint it would be that the lighting in the bathroom where the toilet and shower were was minimal, but that is a complaint we have had in many hotels so we've gotten used to it. The shower itself featured a very nice adjustable showerhead with plenty of water pressure. Again everything was clean and in good condition. The main room consisted of a living room and kitchenette. The room's kitchenette featuring a full size rerigerator, microwave, two burner stove, sink and dishwasher plus a decent selection of plates, glasses, silverware, pans, etc practically begged to be used. Everything was in great condition and the helpful cleaning staff nicely loaded our used dishes and ran the diswasher each day. The living room included a full size couch and arm chair for comfortable lounging in front of another 37\" LG LCT TV, coffee table/ottomans, an end table, a computer disk, and tucked into the corner a table with 2 chairs for eating or reading. It was a very functional layout with plenty of room for two people to spread their stuff around and it was all done very stylishly. There was some street noise as is to be expected in an urban hotel, but less than I've experience in many places. There was no noise from other rooms or the elevator which was 10 feet from the door to our suite. Transportation in the area was a breeze with the two Charm City Circulator routes plus local bus service and the light rail station just a few blocks a way. We took the light rail from BWI to the area of the hotel and then it was a few blocks walk to the hotel itself. Going back to BWI we opted to use SuperShuttle for convenience. It was a mere $13 fare to BWI from the hotel plus tip.and fuel surcharge.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home\u201d", "Author": "Prlgirl", "ReviewID": "UR109391951", "Content": "I did not want to leave the residence inn.

We are from South Carolina so my fianc\u00e9 and I are used to hearing the horror stories of crime in Baltimore. So we figured there's no way we can move there without at least staying a weekend and checking things out. We picked this hotel because it is close to the harbor and hoped that would be safe for walking around. I originally wanted to rent a car to get around but was worried it would be a waste of money if we didn't use it. I called the hotel and they were insistent that I would not need a car to get around, that the area was perfectly safe to walk. Just let me say I am so glad that I listened to them! We were out and about from early in the morning on a Saturday until late afternoon on Monday and had an amazing time. The hotel was great. The room was set up the way a small apartment would be set up, so it felt a little more home-like than a standard hotel room. The hotel was extremely clean and the front desk was one of the more helpful I have encountered. By comparison when I stay in New Orleans I can barely get the front desks to get new towels, here the front desk was helpful with all my questions about the area, calling a cab to get back to the airport, etc etc. At night I woke up a few times because of street noise but I completely expected that to be the case in the city so it was no big deal. Also, the breakfast was great with eggs, biscuits, bagels, etc. The best part for the hotel was that I went to an Orioles game and bought a t-shirt and when I left in the cab I forgot my shirt in the lobby area. When I got to the airport I called and asked if they would hold it until I sent them a labeled box to send it back to me. I half expected it to get lost or the person who received the box to not know what it was for or something like that. But sure enough about a week or so after I mailed the box the shirt came back to me in the mail. I was very impressed that they bothered to take the time to do something like that! This location was perfect to walk around the harbor, to Federal Hill, and U of Maryland-Baltimore/ Camden Yards. We even walked to Mt Vernon and Fells Point, which we thought would be a little sketchy in between the hotel and those areas but it wasn't bad like we thought. The worst I could say was that there were a few panhandlers around the hotel but they weren't especially aggressive or anything to worry about.

It was very busy when we were there, lots of children and it was a holiday. That meant that breakfast was rather more hectic but to be expected. All the usual for hot and cold was available and included in the price of the suite. Yes these are suites, so you get a small kitchen with all appliances, lounge, bedroom and bathroom. Very good size indeed. I always moan on here about wi-fi access but cannot about the residence inn as it's free and was of a good speed too. The location was excellent, a short stroll (less then 5 minutes) and your at the waterfront of the inner harbour where most Baltimore attractions and shops are. It's also a short stroll to the Camden Yards and Baltimore's baseball team the Orioles. Well worth a night out. If you want to go to Lexington Market area (The area is a dump really) or Penn Station for a train to Washington DC then take the free bus which picks up from the side of the residence inn.

Breakfast had staples everyday, but they changed it up a bit. we were so thankful to see that our kids would have a decent breakfast every morning and it would help us save on our food bill for the week. it is a SHORT walk form the harbor area, the convention center (we were there for a conference and then a few days with family), etc. it's right off of several FREE bus lines, and a decent grocery store is within 10 mins walk, as is a walk in clinic if necessary. wiresless and ethernet is included, and they have an area where you can print if necessary. the rooms are nicely appointed and it appears to be new or newly renovated.

However, very busy around 8:30a. There are 2 waffle machines, but a guest didn't oil the pan and burned the waffle maker. The food service employee had to disconnect the waffle maker to clean it which took about 10 - 15 minutes. Overall, all staff that we met while riding on the elevators, housekeeping, front desk personnel, the engineer, and manager/assistant manager are well trained and friendly. Valet parking is $28, but we self parked across the street overnight for $8. Camden Yards is about a 15-minute walk. Inner Harbor is 5-minute walk.

Also notified us of the free breakfast, but didn't have time to even look and see what they offered, but it's a nice extra. The rooms were great. Plenty of room and had a couch (sofabed) and chair. We were only there for a night, but the refridgerator and microwave would come in handy if you were going to be there a few days. While I like the comfort of the rooms at the Hyatt better, the amentities inside the rooms were better here- as mentioned fridge/microwave, as well as stove top and stocked drawers. Also had a full size coffee pot which was great. Location was great. Only a few blocks away from the inner harbor, and pretty close to Camden Yards. Once again, sorry to mention the Hyatt, but we like it's closer location to both better. While we have our favorite hotel in Baltimore, this really made a good impression on us. This has become our second choice now when visiting Baltimore. I'd recommend it to anyone who's going to be in Baltimore for a few+ days so you can better use the amentities in the room.

There was juice and a soda fountain for soda if you didn't want juice or coffee. In the evening they have an \"evening reception\" complete with a keg of beer. I was very surprised at seeing a keg of beer in the hearth room. I had not ever seen that before. I will say that this room was monitored by hotel employees at all times.

Cons: We found a fake nail in one of the folded towels and some of our pots and pans were dirty before we even used them. (This is the reason I dropped from rating this hotel 5 stars to 4 stars.) I also left a comment card for the management to read, however they never called or responded to it. Hence one of the reasons why I'm writing this review.

If ,on the other hand, you want and expect a higher sanitary standard then choose another area hotel.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "earth", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, but noisy renovations\u201d", "Author": "alexandria", "ReviewID": "UR7253424", "Content": "The bellhop, front desk staff, custodians were all extremely pleasant and helpful.

The rooms were clean, spacious, and new. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen well equipped. It was only a 5-10 minute walk to the inner harbor. The staff was friendly and courteous. The free hot breakfast each morning was a big plus. It was much more than we expected. I recommend the comdey factory which is a stand up comedy show just across the street above Burke's cafe. Hint: Do not sit in the front unless you are okay with being part of the show. Also if your looking for night life fun check out the powerplant live near the iner harbor on Market Place. They have multiple bars and sources of entertainment all in a central area. Howl at the Moon was a nice bar.", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cmixed\u201d", "Author": "cpete", "ReviewID": "UR6839679", "Content": "I had read all the recent reviews on tripadvisor (my hotel bible). I found it more mixed than I had hoped. Pluses: Good size, quiet two-room suite. It was reasonably priced with excellent valet car service. There was a good kitchenette as a bonus. The top floor gave no problems with noise. Minuses: I had asked a crib be put in the room twice before we came. When I had to call from the room and ask the third time, the front desk said \"Oh, would you like a crib in the suite?\". Then I felt like a tip was expected for the 30 seconds it took to assemble. (I generally tip well, but didn't like that I had to ask 3 times). There was only one temperature control which would have been fine if I had known. The living room and the bedroom were somewhat different and I got up in the middle of night searching for an extra blanket. The linnens and pillows were disappointing too...5 pillows, but all the same - quite uncomfortable.", "Date": "February 25, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Inn by Marriott Baltimore Downtown/Inner Harbor", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60811-d566439-Reviews-Residence_Inn_by_Marriott_Baltimore_Downtown_Inner_Harbor-Baltimore_Maryland.html", "Price": "$161 - $272*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">17 Light St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Baltimore</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21202</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "566439", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e3/ab/b0/studio-king-suite.jpg"}}
