For some reason, the hoteliers have gotten together and decided that everyone who attends this race is a millionaire and as a result, they triple the normal nightly rate, require non-refundable prepayment, as well as a minimum stay. We booked this hotel in June 2010 at the rate of $132 Canadian per night, providing a credit card as a guarantee only, and with a 24 hour cancellation policy. The 2011 Grand Prix race dates had not yet been announced. When we checked in at the hotel June 9, 2011, we were told our credit card had been charged on May 11, 2011, for our entire 4 night stay, without having notified us of this. When we quetioned this change of the conditions of our (printed) reservation, we were told \"this is the policy during the Grand Prix - besides you got a terrific rate - everyone else is paying at least $400 per night!!\" Needless to say, we were not happy about this arbitrary change in the terms of our reservation contract and that our credit card had been charged without having been notified. The card we used to guarantee the room is not one we are currently using. Thankfully, it was still a valid credit card. Our room was a 2 bed suite with a small kitchette. At check-in, you are told housekeeping is only done weekly, so our room was not cleaned for 4 days. You could however, turn in soiled towels and exchange them for new ones. You can ask for shampoo and soap at the front desk. Shower caps are not available. There are free washers and dryers, but you must provide your own detergent. There is free internet, but it was so slow it was not worth even trying to connect. The location is good for sightseeing. Underground parking (which is shared by the Holiday Inn Express next door) is available for $18 per day - plus many, many taxes. Every available parking space was taken when we were there and I do not know where you would park if there was no space in the garage. The window air conditioner was quite noisy, making sleep difficult.

We had a room facing the \"courtyard\" and it was relatively quiet; no complaints. The hotel had a small gym, free laundry room and a TV room with stallite TV.

The only few suggestions I would have - which I already shared via a hotel survey - is, this hotel could use a good coat of paint everywhere in the interior to freshen it up - and use a more vibrant color than the drab tan color on the walls now. The beds were a bit firm for us and the pillows a bit too soft - but no biggie. And last, the in-room TV had only very basic stations, and most in French; we had to go down to the hotel TV room to watch more satellite channels to get CNN and a familiar English speaking movie here and there - we weren't there to watch TV, but it would have been nice to get a few more channel in our room.

The room was in excellent physical condition with 2 flat screen TV's,DVD player, view of the beautiful City Hall in the view port section of the city, full kitchen. No mold or old and dilapidated furniture. The negatives: -The air conditioning unit is only in the bedroom. It is also a very loud machine. It cools off the suite if you turn it up high and leave the bedroom door open, but the bedroom will feel like Antartica. -No housekeeping, which is a facet of Candelwood's service. You will need to run down to the lobby for extra towels, soap or tissues etc. And you have to make your own bed (or not). -No ice machine on the Candlewood side of the hotel. You will have to run over to the Holiday Inn Express which is a seperate entrance in the same building. -No Breakfast bar but you could probably sneak into the Express and no one would know or care, or you could cook your own. Overall I would not hesitate to go back but don't expect the Four Seasons or the Bellagio.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cgreat solution\u201d", "Author": "cya", "ReviewID": "UR17266686", "Content": "We recently vacationed in Montreal with our 18 year old son. We did not want to book 2 hotels rooms so when we found Candlewood Suites we went ahead and made a reservation. It was the perfect solution for us. My wife and I had a comfortable queen bedroom with 2 night stands, dresser, closet, window, AC and a LCD TV. Our son in the lounge area had a nice sleeper sofa, another larger LCD TV and DVD player. There were 2 -leather like, full recliner, chairs and end table. A lanai and window faced the old town and port. The bathroom had a full size shower/tub. There was also a fully furnished kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, cooktop, coffee maker, dishes, pot and pans. An eating counter and bar stools too. On the ground floor (RC) rez des chaussee is reception, business center (free internet and printing), laundry, and exercise room. The place was very clean, and conveniently located. The Holiday Inn Express, their sister property is next door. 5 minute walk to the old town, it borders Chinatown, 10 minutes to downtown and 15 to the train station. Nice IGA supermarket 3 blocks one direction, small grocery store 2 blocks another. Neighborhood surrounding is not great but it was OK, we felt safe at all times. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t book it if you want a luxury hotel experience with nice amenities, full service, bell hops etc. There is not daily maid service. Book it if you want a clean, conveniently located hotel with lots of room. A real value here.", "Date": "June 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cnew years amazing hotel\u201d", "Author": "ms_turee", "ReviewID": "UR16723795", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel 2 times..n its always been a good stay...very clean...very roomy...extremely friendly staff that are always willing to help...we had 7 people in the room for new years when maximum was 4...and never got noise complaints...its full of teens and party people so if you want a fun place stay here.
