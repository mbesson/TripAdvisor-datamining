Rooms are very small, ranging from bad to worse if you have the basement room. It gets very noisy at night from returning guests and the hotel reception. Do NOT let the hotel book any activities such as the fish restaurant dinner or Turkish baths. We were massively overcharged for the dinner - \u00c2\u00a390 for a plate of meze, 3 prawns and a seabass! No bellydancing, no tasteful meal and no other patrons as promised by the hotel. Breakfast consists of old bread, instant coffee, tomatoes, 3 mini slices of polony, dried olives and cherry jam. The portions became progressively smaller every morning to the point of spartan proportions. Wifi in the hotel is incredibly slow if you are fortunate to be logged on for longer than 2 minutes. All in all, Ida hotel was a little disappointing in every aspect and the staff may be helpful, but they are completely clueless as to pricing of anything on offer.

Rooms are small but cosy enough and allow for good sleeps at night even though we were sleeping on the street side. The point at issue for us was the cleanliness although we are not fussy, the floor was really dirty and was not washed a single time during the 7 days we stayed there, the room was always very dusty. Most towels were stained when we arrived even though they seemed cleaned afterwards and the bathroom sink needed attention also. The water in the shower did not evacuate normally. Even on a budget you would expect higher standards. The beautiful terrace view also was quite spoilt by the uncleanliness of it. We would recommend this hotel for those like us who would travel on a budget since Istanbul has so much to offer.

The two men and one woman working at the hotel that I met were the best ever--considerate, one even serving as a volunteer (unpaid) guide one morning. The breakfasts were the best; the basic olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, cold cuts, boiled egg, crusty bread PLUS a thin eggy crepe or a kind of crispy french toast.There are a couple of issues which one might expect for the very reasonable prices. One is to get to the lovely breakfasts on the balcony you must climb three very steep and crampled little flights of stairs, although I am sure if you could not do that one of the kind staff would bring you breakfast.

I was travelling with a friend, and found the location of Ida was ideal for restaurants and shisha, which is what we were looking for as we did not want to travel long distances to eat at night. The blue mosque is just a five minute walk away as is the nearest tram stop, which connects Sultanahmet to the rest of Istanbul. The area is full of tourists and seems safe - we had no problems when we were there. As for the hotel itself the rooms are on the small side but there is a good sized double bed with sufficient space for luggage. We were given the basement room - not ideal but since we didn't spend much time in the room itself it didn't really bother us. The breakfast is served on the small roof terrace four floors up (with a view of the blue mosque on one side and the sea on the other side). One thing which concerned us was the stairs in the hotel are steep, narrow and made of marble so if you're not careful you could easily fall! Breakfast consists of rolls or bread, three slices of cucumber and tomato and some sort of pink meat - not a great meal but after speaking to other tourists living in similar budget hotels is apparently common in Turkey.

This was our first big trip, and thanks TA for all the reccs, and I'm working my way through my own reviews of all the places we stayed in Turkey and Greece. We chose this hotel based on TA reviews -- looking for something well-located, clean, affordable, and with good views. We were satisfied, and it was a pleasant stay, but if we went back to Istanbul, we'd probably try another hotel to see what else is out there. The best thing about it was the rooftop area. The other reviews are right; Blue Mosque to one side and Sea of Marmaris to the other. From our rooms (we requested the best view and had it for the first two nights, but they had informed us we'd need to move one floor down the third night due to another reservation), we could also see the minarets of the Blue Mosque. It was also a very convenient location, although we were there during the World Cup and could hear the busy restaurants and bars on the street below us at night (but we slept fine). The rooms were TINY -- space for the bed and that's about it, and the one on the top floor had a huge waterstain in the ceiling, plus the bathroom wasn't spotless. The room below it, that we moved to on our last night, was actually a little nicer. I don't remember them coming to clean it while we were there. But it was comfortable enough, and the shower was decent - showerhead like we're used to, walled in like we're used to, decent water pressure and hot water. This is NOT a hotel for anyone who has trouble with stairs. I suppose you could stay on the first floor, but to get up to the other rooms and the roof, you take the crazy tiny windy staircase. Didn't bother us, but just an FYI. Overall a good stay, and Istanbul itself was AMAZING. The man (owner?) was very pleasant and his (wife?) who served breakfast every morning was also nice. The (son?) who also worked the front desk was ok, except for the fact that when we arrived later than we thought we would, due to a delayed flight, the first thing he said to us when we walked in was an accusing, \"Why are you so late?\" It was pretty rude, but didn't really bother us -- it was mostly just weird and confusing. (This may have had to do with the fact that we got the shuttle service through the hotel which worked out great but I feel bad if that poor driver was waiting the whole couple extra hours for us at the airport since we'd had no way to call ahead once delayed. Also a word to the wise -- we saw tons of travel agencies around, advertising airport to hotel service, for about a third of the cost.) PS - passing on the best advice we received: Get to the major stuff (Topkapi Palace, Aya Sofia, etc) EARLY in the morning -- it's SO worth it to beat the crowds. We thought the extra ticket price for the harem at the palace was worth it. And don't miss Basilica Cistern.
