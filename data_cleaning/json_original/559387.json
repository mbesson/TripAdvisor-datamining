The hotel is top notch in every way and is located in a nice residential-type sea-side area, and is a short walk to the convention center. The beach and boardwalk are just down the street, and there is a modern shopping mall across the street from the hotel. (This came in handy as my luggage was damaged on the flight over.) As a Diamond member we were upgraded to a high floor with concierge lounge privileges. The concierge lounge was very nice and offered spectacular views of the water and city from the wrap around balcony. Sitting outside in the evening having a drink and snack was wonderful! The concierge (and all of the hotel staff) were very friendly and helpful with my questions and sightseeing requests. (First was luggage, and second and third were restaurants, port arrangements etc.) As we were tired the first night from the flight, the Concierge suggested the mall across the street, which was a perfect choice for us (and several others we saw there as well from the hotel). There are several restaurants there, including a couple casual outdoor tapas bars we went to which really hit the spot. We liked it so much we went again on our return visit after the cruise. The room itself was very comfortable, and well furnished. The lounge has complimentary beer, wine, spirits, and soft drinks, along with some nice appetizers. We also had breakfast here as well. It was nice socializing with the other guests in the evening as well. On a weekend night we were there in May, a band was playing outside, beach-side down from the hotel. We could hear the music lightly up on the balcony and watch the crowds gather for the concert; quite enjoyable and relaxing after a day touring around. The Hop on Hop off bus (actually there are two different companies) stops near the hotel, and we used that to sightsee all over town, although the subway and trams are close by as well. The walk along the beachside is most pleasant, and as the hotel is so tall, you don't have to worry about getting loss. Although we didn't use it because were busy sightseeing, we did walk down to the pool area one evening, and found it to be very attractive and inviting.

I landed around 15.00 in the afternoon in Barcelona El Prat airport, after a quick walk I took a taxi to the hotel. The hotel is about 25-30 minutes by taxi away from the airport and will cost around 30 euro one way, on a normal working day. I arrived on a public holiday so the price was around 45 euro one way. The taxi arrived around 15.45 at the hotel but nobody came to help me with my luggage. Once I entered the hotel, finally someone helped me with my bags. The lobby area was empty and I proceeded to the Hhonors check in where I checked in with a lady. She wore a light brown dress but no name tag or something on her. The lady, called Raquel was unfortunately not friendly at all and the check in was very short and all without a smile. She asked my id card and that\u2019s all. I was more a number in the line who had to check in. The stay was booked under Hhonors gold card but she refused to give me anything of the benefits. No club lounge access, no internet, no room upgrade or even no breakfast. I was very unsatisfied and wanted to speak with her supervisor. Mr. Javier came to me but he just told me he could not do anything. I then asked for the duty manager to call me when I would be in my room. I so left the reception with a very, very bad first impression of the hotel and its staff members. I went to my room on the 16th floor. My room was at the end of the short corridor, number 1619. The room was typical Hilton and when I entered on my right side was a bathroom with a sink, bath, shower and toilet. There were new Hilton bath products, clean towels but there was no soap at all. The bathroom was clean but the shower was leaking and the showerhead was not fixed properly. Then the bedroom, there was a kettle with tea bags, a TV, desk, two rather small Twin beds, closet with safe and a small seating area. My room had partially City and also a bit sea view and also not to forget on the terrace of the executive lounge one floor beneath me. There was no welcome letter, no welcome drink, no fruit or not even a complimentary bottle of water in the room. Not even for Gold members and it was the first time ever we did not get any welcome in the room. A few minutes later, the duty manager Mr. Domenico called me and I explained the situation and the inconveniences at check in. He first of all apologized for it and he could not confirm any of my benefits as there were hardly staff members in the hotel who could decide about this. He was apparently the Food and Beverage manager so he invited me for complimentary breakfast during my stay in the main restaurant on the first floor. It was the first time at any Hilton I got problems like these. I went to the reception and asked another lady, not the unfriendly Ms. Raquel, for some directions to the city center. From her accent I think she was German. She explained me the way to the metro, highlights in Barcelona and gave me some maps. I left the hotel and after a 10 minute walk I arrived at the closest metro station : Forum. Line 4 passes there and it are 7 stops before the city center. I got off at Jaume I and I walked a bit around. Next morning I proceeded to the main restaurant to have breakfast. I was friendly greeted by Mr. Giovanni who brought me to a table and offered me some fresh orange juice and asked me if I wanted to drink something. He was extremely friendly and helpful too. After a few minutes Mr. Pablo brought me a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was slightly cold and was just a mix of powder and milk. Mr. Pablo was also very friendly . Buffet is extensive and there is a wide choice of charcuterie like fresh smoked salmon, jamon and there was even a tasty Spanish corner with typical things like fuet. Buffet was extremely good and had higher standards than most Hilton hotels. Service was excellent and everything was filled regularly. After breakfast I called Mr. Domenico back and first of all said that breakfast was escellent but I also asked if he already heard something. He told me he had to ask it to the general manager, Mr. Rodriguez but or he could not reach him or he was in a meeting or he had lunch. During my stay I never got a reply on my questions of the benefits and so never got them. I spend a whole day in the city and in the evening my room was cleaned properly but the tea bags were not refilled. Some people contacted me by phone but on all hotel phones I had a lot of noise and I could hardly hear the other side. Also when I took a bath, there was hardly hot water and I had to put it on 50-60 degrees Celsius before even some hot water came. Next morning again breakfast but unfortunately it was not as good as the day before. As nobody came to greet me I just took a table and waited before someone came. Mr. Giovanni was not in the restaurant and Mr. Pablo was very busy. After 10 minutes Mr. Pablo saw me and gave me some orange juice and my hot chocolate. Service was too slow that day and the bottles of water and juices were empty for a long time. Then after a while Mr. Giovanni came and things were better then. Fruit that day was excellent and the fuet was very tasty and one of my favorites at the buffet. I went to the reception and asked if I could print my boarding cards somewhere. Ms. Laurine, who was in training told me I could use the hotels paid computer for it. I was a bit amazed as most 4 and 5 star hotels provide this service complimentary. Then Mr. Oscar came and I asked it again for the boarding cards. He told me I could use the designated laptop free of charge for boarding card on the left of the reception. Mr. Oscar was very friendly and I asked him also if I could have a late check out for next day. My flight was around 20.15 and I got a very late check out at 17.30 free of charge from the friendly Mr. Oscar. I went to the laptop to print my boarding card but the keyboard was not working at all so I asked Ms. Iona for help. She was too very friendly and fixed the problem after a few minutes. I headed back to my room and very strangely on my floor, all room doors were open and the locks were drilled out. It was a ghost floor but only my room was still intact. The work men closed a door in front of my door but my room key did not work on that one so I had to go back downstairs and I asked Ms. Veronica for recoding the key. She did and also sent Mr. Alexander with me to check if the door worked now, and yes it did. During that day I had a lot of noise disturbance and it was not easy to ignore the sounds so I left the hotel but before that I asked to Mr. Edgar for some information about my next hotel in Madrid, also a Hilton. He checked for me the hours of the shuttle bus there and helped me with some directions. I asked some directions again to Ms. Raquel, now with name tag on. She spoke very loud and she was explaining some bars to have drink but in fact she lead us to the more disco area of Barcelona. I arrived back in the hotel in the later evening and it was deserted, reception closed and nobody in the hotel but the door was luckily open. Next morning last breakfast and I was greeted by Mr. Pablo who gave me a hand and asked if everything was fine. No hot chocolate for me anymore and breakfast was again very good. Mr. Giovanni said goodbye to me and I went back to my room and headed to the Sagrada Familia. In the afternoon I was back and they were still working at the doors next to me. I checked later in the afternoon out with Mr. Oscar and left the hotel by taxi. Taxis are plentiful in front of the hotel and metro stations is 10 minutes away. Overall a very average impression from a zero percent goodwill hotel and with somewhat mixed staff. The one is extremely friendly, the other one not. The hotel had 4 stars and the rate is at the high side for the quality and service you get. The location is out of the city center but is reachable in 30 minutes by metro or 15 minutes by taxi. I do not think I will ever return here, if I would it will be for the excellent breakfast !", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cNice Hilton, worth the detour.\u201d", "Author": "621VladC", "ReviewID": "UR121598698", "Content": "Large spacious rooms, excellent service, excellent benefits for HH members, very nice lounge.

I was greeted with a warm smile by reception on the ground floor who checked me in quickly and I was headed up to my room on the 23rd floor in just minutes. The lady at reception didn\u2019t mention that I could have checked in on the 15th floor in the executive lounge but then I did receive a complimentary upgrade to the executive floor and so I wasn\u2019t really that fussed. The room was a corner room and very nicely appointed. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower, a bidet, a toilet and a glass bowl for the sink which was funky. All the usuals were on offer, too \u2013 oversized toiletries from Crabtree & Evelyn, soft bath robes, slippers and fluffy towels, and there was a small but stylish window over the bath tub which afforded great views of the Sagrada Familial cathedral once you were in the tub itself \u2013 which I just had to try out and nice it was, too. Returning to the bedroom, the bed was comfortable and complete with soft and hard pillows. The TV was a flat screen variety and came with multiple channels so I could switch between MTV, CNN, BBC World, CNBC as well as numerous Spanish, Italian, French and German channels. Great to catch up on some of the programs I used to watch when I lived abroad. Complimentary internet was offered given my status, which was great, though had I not been offered the vouchers, I would have been incensed with the prices the Swisscom Wi-Fi command. Basically, it costs 27 Euros for 24 hours access which I believe is too much and it is with constant amazement that I wonder why the Hilton Corporation continues to do business with Swisscom when there must be better and cheaper deals out there for the end-user. So just beware, if you don\u2019t get given a voucher and you want to go online, you will have to stump up 27 Euros per day for the privilege. I stayed 3 nights in total and headed each morning to the executive lounge on the 15th floor. Beware that you will to insert your key card into the elevator slot to make it stop on the executive floors. Breakfast \u2013 despite the continental description \u2013 was sumptuous and complete with local specialities and great coffee. I particularly liked the freshly squeezed orange juice and the local queso. In the afternoon, the lounge serves a great afternoon tea complete with cakes and cookies and then come the evening, the liquor is brought out and folks descend on the lounge to enjoy cocktails with nibbles, which are rather delicious. Internet access in the lounge is the same as in the rooms, so if you don\u2019t have a voucher, you will need to stump up again. And even the two computer terminals (offered again by rip-off merchant Swisscom) in the lounge charge you for internet access. One nice feature of the lounge is the outside terrace area where there is ample seating and from where you have a great view of the Mediterranean sea. It\u2019s a great place to have drinks, your breakfast or indeed afternoon tea, as long as it is warm enough. I had room service one evening in my room and thought it was a little overpriced. I had a chicken salad and a glass of wine \u2013 the bill came to \u20ac31. I was shocked. Sure, the hotel has overheads and costs, but 42 USD is tough to swallow when it is hardly fine dining. Other features of the hotel that I enjoyed were the gym. A little on the small side, it has all the main equipment including treadmills, bikes, rowing machines, cross trainers and weights. There is a sauna too though I did not have time to use it. There is also a great outdoor pool and bar which in the summer months must get packed, but I visited the hotel in November and there was no-one outside at the pool at the time. In total, I enjoyed the hotel immensely. Sure, there are a few niggles )overpriced internet access and room service), but don\u2019t let these put you off. The service, smiles and hospitality afforded to you by reception, the lounge staff and the chambermaids make up for it all. I have also stayed at the other Hilton in Barcelona on the other side of town and enjoyed that one, too. It would seem that the Hiltons in this Catalan city can be justifiably proud of the service and comfort that they offer.

We had a wonderful time throughout our stay. Vacationers seem to be mostly aware that this is a business hotel primarily, so rooms are not designed for lengthy stays. Room decor is very modern and comfortable, but there are no drawers for storage. The design is not handy for unpacking our clothes, but we made do with the shelves provided. The hotel staff from the valets to front desk staff to executive lounge staff to housekeeping to restaurant staff were all very gracious and helpful to us at all times. Since a previous reviewer noted issues with the valet service, we would like to report that we were met by a valet at the taxi for our fairly early morning arrival, with our luggage taken care of until we were able to check into our room. On departure, we again had excellent valet service with his helping deposit our luggage into the cab and arranging our method of payment with the not-quite-fluent, although very friendly, cab driver. My husband is a Hilton diamond member so we were able to use the executive lounge. We had hoped to be upgraded to a better room as some reviewers have reported, but the hotel was almost continuously booked with conferences and this was not possible. Our room on the twenty-first floor had a good view of the Mediterranean, although there is a street with businesses between the hotel and ocean, as one would expect in a business district. The food provided in the lounge was delicious and plentiful for breakfast and dinner (tapas) with desserts provided at tea-time. The staff manning the desk in the executive lounge were helpful with our tourist questions, and the servers were very good natured and non-obtrusive in keeping tables cleared, food and drinks readily available, and the patrons happy during our extended stay. How could our stay have been perfect? A guest laundry would have been nice, since the laundry service prices are prohibitive to folks like us on vacation. However, we were able to locate a very nice laundromat on 41 Carrer del Clot, riding the lovely new tram located very near the hotel - La Farinera station, just a short walk from there. We toted our dirty clothes in our rolling suitcase and were able to find the laundromat easily on this picturesque street. When we had difficulty figuring out how to work the machines, a couple of manicurists from the spa across the street who were also doing laundry eagerly assisted us - although neither of us spoke the other's language. We would have also appreciated a gift shop in or near the hotel. Although there is a large shopping center across the street, it is fairly generic and could easily be in our own towns at home - with the exception of some local restaurants. Since we are procrastinators and had delayed finding gifts for our family and friends at home, we could find nothing in the area that was uniquely Barcelona or Spain. We were told by the helpful lady at the front desk that local arts and crafts items could only be obtained uptown. One would think even conference attendees in such a beautiful city would appreciate having quality local items to take home to their loved ones.

Beer, wine, and soft drinks are available with spirits available in the evening. It has an indoor and outdoor area and is a quiet retreat for some reading. The only drawback is that there is a small charge for the use of the computer but wifi is available throughout the hotel (free for Diamond members). The buffet breakfast in the restaurant is extensive and can set you up for the day. There is a good shopping mall directly across the road with many shops and eateries. Although the hotel is out of the city centre, the metro station is only a few minutes walk away and the Barcelona tour buses stop across the street. The metro pass allows travel on the metro, tram, and local buses and is execellent value as it also gives free access to many attractions. All-in-all this hotel is well worth a visit.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cNice stay\u201d", "Author": "SaraBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR119667482", "Content": "I spent two nights at the Hilton (mix of business and leisure trip).

Yes, it is a little outside the main city sights, but the hotel...in particular the Executive Lounge and the sea views, made the stay completely worth it. First off, the hotel is not that far from the sights and there are many ways to get there easily. There is a subway stop no more than a 3-5 minute walk from the hotel and will get you to all parts of Barcelona within 10 minutes. You can also take a taxi, which is what we did in the evenings when we went out to dinner, which is very easy and inexpensive. There is a mall across the street with a grocery store, shops, department store, quickie food restaurants, etc, which is nice should you need to pick something up. The hotel itself has very nice rooms, but what makes a stay here is access to the Executive Lounge and a room with a sea view. The executive floors are 15 and 19-23 and the Executive Lounge is on the 15th floor. We stayed in Room 2215....have a look at the pictures. The Executive Lounge has a view of the sea and an inside; as well as, outside area to sit at. It is so nice to have breakfast up there in the mornings and drinks and apps in the evening before heading out to a restaurant for dinner. There is a cold breakfast (shame on Hilton for not having any hot food selections at all---some scrambled eggs would suffice) there in the morning, finger foods in the eary evening, and free beer, wine, and liquor all day long. There is a nice gym in the hotel and a really nice outdoor pool and pool bar should you choose to lounge for a bit. There is a beach about a 5 walk from the hotel which is very nice if you want to lay out or take a walk on. As far as restaurants go in Barcelona, we found the best restaurants to be in the Eixample area. Our most favorite tapas restaurant...we ate there twice...was Catalana. It is a fun, trendy restaurant with really good (and strong) Sangria, great tapas, and great prices. You will most likely have to wait when you go for dinner, but it is totally worth it. We did go to the Olympic Port restaurant area on the beach for drinks and possibly dinner, but ended up skipping it because the restaurants were kind of pricey and not too crowded. The restaurants there like Bestial and Shoko are very trendy and turn into dance clubs at night. I would think that if you went there later at night, say around 11pm, that it would be very crowded and full of people. So bottom line, my recommendation is to stay at this hotel and pay for an executive room floor with a sea view. If you cannot afford an executive room, than I do really like this hotel and would stay here again due to the fact the hotel has very nice and spacious hotel rooms that you would expect from a Hilton. Hint: There is an amazing hot and cold breakfast buffet in the restaurant downstairs should you choose that over the lousy cold breakfast in the executive lounge.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cClose to the beach & easy transportation\u201d", "Author": "texwegian", "ReviewID": "UR119308779", "Content": "Very helpful staff...they give everyone individual attention, which frustrates some who don't like to wait, but worth it!

The room was nice, not sure the water view was the best choice however, as the beach was a few blocks away and the view was mainly the backs of other high rises. I would recommend the city view, as we noticed the pretty city views from the elevator areas and realized we might have made a mistake in our choice.

We also had wireless internet access-which we were assigned log ins at check in-my recollection is that this was complimentary due to my Hilton Diamond status.

The location will not suit people who want to be in the centre of the action but is is nice to come back and be away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre,the transport links are very good and we found the metro was ideal to get to most places, the trains are very punctual, have air conditioning and you can use your phone,they certainly put the London underground to shame. We never felt unsafe and used them even late at night. The tourist bus routes are great and the green route runs past the hotel with a stop just down the road.we would come back without tomorrow if we could.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wassenaar, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cPerfect service\u201d", "Author": "Ineke082", "ReviewID": "UR117910848", "Content": "Nice hotel, big rooms vieuw on the beach and with a good swimming pool.

On arrival at the hotel we had been upgraded to a larger room due to it being my partner's birthday whilst we were away, the room was on the sixteenth floor and absolutely blew us away with one of the most stunning views I have ever had the pleasure to see. The view looked out over all of Barcelona and I mean all of the city with no obstructions you had a perfect view of the city from every angle possible, whilst we also had a view of the beach and coastline. The room itsself was to a very high standard with a fantastic bed in both size and comfort, a well sized corridor and plenty of storage room with a clean and well presented bathroom containing both bath and seperate shower. Whilst on the day of my partner's birthday a complimentary bottle of champagne and birthday cake was delivered to our room by cheerful room service staff. This little touch really helped to make her birthday a day to remember. The rest of the hotel was of typical hilton fair, we had breakfast every morning which was well presented and of high quality with plenty of attentive staff although do be warned obviously a hotel of this size is often busy but we didn't encounter any issues. We also dined at the restaurant on our second night and received excellent service and wonderful mediterranean quisine, of course the prices are high but what do you expect this is a Hilton and the prices are standard across this and many similar hotels to this quality. We spent a few days sat around the pool top bar enjoying the views of the city alongside the undoubted comfortable surroundings. In terms of the area the Hilton Diaganol is loacated outside of the city centre but with easy transport connections such as the new tram system and the metro within walking distance whilst taxi's are cheap and plentiful. Although it is out of the city centre the views that are available from the hotel and the location next Barcelona's beaches make this a good choice if you're looking for a break out of the city centre but with it still in easy reach. All of the staff we encountered were polite, friendly and approachable some of the previous comments regarding this hotel certainly don't match with the experience we encountered. This was a perfect stay in a high quality hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to come back and am indeed planning to in the near future. Comments regarding the attitude of staff are false in my opinion, every staff member spoke numerous languagaes perfectly including catalan, spanish, english, german.

Only two negatives to the hotel. The service was mixed; some staff were friendly and helpful and some were neither. For instance, one of the staff in the Executive Lounge was informing me of times for a train to a certain location, but she failed to tell me that I could pick up the train at a station closer than the station of origination. I ended up missing my train and having to change my plans. The other negative is the hotel is a bit of a distance from the center of things, requiring taking the metro or expensive taxis to get to the center of town or to other touristy sites.

We wanted to take our kids someplace that they would enjoy (beach, pool) and we could enjoy (great architecture and art). We used points (there was a miscommunication between the hotel and Hilton, which customer service in the US was able to fix with our room, which the hotel and customer service Hilton Spain could not--and would have charged us for the kids. The customer service in the US was great.) The hotel is great for kids. There are two pools -- a big one and a kids pool that was perfect for our two year old. There are a ton of lounge chairs by the pool (and away from the pool if you want it quieter) and a chess board on the ground. There is also a massage area and bar/snack bar area that we didn't use. The gym is great. There are three treadmills, three bikes, and three cross training machines. There is a tv in the room and lots of weight machines and free weights. The beach is only two blocks away--so easy. There is a playground right there (which we didn't use). Across the street is a shopping mall...not the best stores but it has a grocery store, Starbucks, and some kid games out front. The rooms are very nice -- there are some English language tv stations. One point is that the hotel is not in the middle of things. But, the metro is very close (3 blocks away) and super easy. You can take the yellow line almost anywhere. We transferred a couple of times but generally it took us everywhere we wanted to go. You can actually go to the Sagrada Familia by not going through the downtown (going to the other end of the yellow line and transferring). We didn't take the ride on and off bus but met people that took and liked it. We went to the breakfast once -- it was very big and had tons of food. We used points and it was easy to stay there. If you want to be in the middle of things and have a pool -- you certainly can do that. But it is a good family hotel and not too difficult to get to the sites with the great metro (not worth taking a cab).

First of all the location was great for us. Situated just 300m from the beach, 300m from the underground system and across the road from a huge shopping center. It all depends what you are looking for. The area around the hotel isn't quite finished, you can feel that the Spanish down turn has hit the devolpement of the area. But the place is safe and quiet. The hotel it self lacks the \"Bling Bling\" of the hilton brand. It seems to be used mainly as a \"Hub\" for cruise ships, who dump bus loads of guests for an over night stay, or request people stay before boarding. This seems to take the soul out of the place. It dosen't have the \"Wow\" factor of many Hilton hotels. First tip, if you come by car, don't use the hotel car park, at 26 euros a night, drive on past the hotel, just 300 m first right then right again and you come to the forum car park, 35 euros for 5 days !. The money we saved on the car park we took un upgrade to a relaxing room. Second tip, if you want a relaxing room, don't book it to start off with on the web site, wait until you confirm your booking and they will offer you an upgrade, take it at this point and it will save you 16 euors a night on the standard relaxing room rate. The room itself (Relaxing room with see view) was fine, a bit small 31 sq m, and a little worse for ware. The Bose sound system wasn't working and 1 cd was missing. (you should have 2 relaxing cd's tolisten to in the room).the toilet had a small leak and some of the wood has come off the wall. The view wasn't of the sea, but three huge office blocks built between the hotel and the sea, you can see the sea on either side, but 75% of the view is officies.As the windows aren't tinted, you have to keep the curtins closed, if not people working can see all that is going on in the room. Not nice. As a couple, we wanted a quiet room, being in a relaxing room kept us away from the cruise ship customers (and their kids ) its your best bet. Breakfast was great, good selection. We didn't use the pool, didn't like the fact that the 3 office blocks over look the pool area. And we prefer the beach anyway. Staff were fantastic everywhere in the hotel. The fact that the shopping center is just across the road with a very large selection of good food and bars, much cheaper than at the hotel, means that the hotel lounge doesn't have many clients.. and the hotel doesn't do anthing to keep people in the lounge to give the impression there is life in the hotel. They could give free wifi for example, this would keep poeple there, instead they chose to charge a staggering 27 euros for 24 hours !!! Stupid prices.. Yes we will be back, overall a good experence, and a good place to have a great break. That said, they do charge Hilton 4 star prices, for what I would say is only a 3 star property, and 5 star staff.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bristol", "Title": "\u201clove this hotel and love Barcelona!\u201d", "Author": "bigpantsBristol", "ReviewID": "UR115687208", "Content": "checked in quite late on Friday evening, requested a sea room and was given an upgrade to tranquil room with Sea View!

No dimmable lighting was a bit of a surprise, and they don't provide wash-cloths - but lots of fluffy towels, robes, slippers, safe and everything you'd want or need in a hotel room. Our rooms looked towards the city which was perfectly nice - the sea's a bit distant even if you get a room on that side. Try to buy a rate which includes breakfast, which is generous and exceptionally good and the staff in the restaurant are charming - but if you have to pay extra for it, there's a great shopping centre literally across the street which has a huge Alcampo supermarket, and lots of cafes and restaurants if you want something lighter or cheaper. It seemed to be open till almost midnight, at least on Saturday evening when we passed through coming back from the metro. The metro is just the other side of the shopping complex - station is El Maresme I Forum on the yellow L3 line and in 15-20 minutes will take you painlessly to Jaume I or Passeig de Gracia and the centre of everything. A 10-journey metro ticket (which can be shared between more than one person) cost 7.85 Euros, and the service is fast, clean, air-conditioned and seems to run every three or four minutes. We appreciated being out of the tourist/pickpocket centre of Barca at night, and enjoyed the sea breeze - although it CAN smell appalling if the wind is in the wrong direction, but you don't get it inside the air-conditioned hotel - and the short stroll from the station back to the hotel. Two brands of 'hop on hop off' sightseeing buses also stop directly outside, charging 23 Euros for a one-day or 30 Euros for a two-day pass which is reasonable value for the serious sightseer. If you want to be in the centre, this is not the hotel for you, and another compromise might be in Barceloneta where you're near the water but closer to the town, but if you can get a deal for double rooms including breakfast at around a hundred UK pounds as we did, it felt like a bargain. There were a lot of American passengers from low-rent mass-market ships like NCL and Carnival using the hotel for pre- or post- cruise touring which made the atmosphere in the lobby a bit like a polyester convention in Cleveland, but not for long. Hotel staff were very helpful and knowledgeable, some even anticipating needs or questions before being asked, and noting my birth date only from my passport/registration, the hotel delivered cava and chocolate cake to the room. Be aware that ANYthing outside your 'package' will be expensive - a simple room service burger will set you back 40 Euros once you've included tray charge, tax and tip, a coke from the minibar runs to about 6 Euros. Wi-Fi is NOT included anywhere in the hotel, a serious omission for a 'business' place like this one, and costs 27 Euros a day plus service/tax.

It all started when they looked at us when we walked up with jeans and backpacks and not suits or dress. It got worse when they found we were Americans. The next night they were giving other Americans trouble! We have never felt discriminated against until this hotel. We didn't have any other problems in the area except with that hotel. I still can not believe they didn't want to give us a room and tried to turn us away at 10pm with two kids. I was extremely disappointed with their desk service.

You can buy water and snacks for reasonable prices at the grocery store, which is huge. The selection of olive oils and the low prices were awesome. We like to walk. The beach is two blocks away from the hotel, and offers some small restaurants for drinks and tapas. We walked from the hotel down Barceloneta. The walk took about 45 minutes and was enjoyable. It was not warm enough to use the pool, however if the weather had been more cooperative, I would not hesitate the next time we are in Barcelona to make some time for laying by the pool. We left this Hilton wishing that we received the same quality of service at Hilton Hotels in the states. My one complaint is the high rate for parking.

Main disappointment was that the rooms are not very soundproof which is surprising for a Hilton hotel. I was on the Executive floor and constantly heard a lot of noise from other rooms/staff/guests coming in late at night. The rooms are nice and breakfast is fantastic with plenty of choice. I found it strange there was no concierge at the hotel but I suppose they mainly use this hotel for business. The hotel staff on the reception desk were not very friendly or welcoming when I checked in and then called me the next morning at 7am to double check my reservation! which again I found surprising considering it was Hilton hotel. I did have 1 day to tour round Barcelona and although the hop on/hop off tour bus is just around the corner from the hotel (5 minutes walk if that) you have to stay on the bus and change buses to get on the 'red' route to take you to most the sites. Not a big deal but can waste time if you are waiting for buses or buses are full! You can take the metro into town but as I was travelling alone I used the tourist bus (which I can highly recommend). The beach is a 5 minutes walk from the hotel and is quite empty most the time as most the people go to the beach on the Port Olympic side which is around a 40-45 minutes walk from the hotel. I wouldn't suggest walking to Las Ramblas from this hotel as I think it's quite a distance. The hotel was nice, but there was no atmosphere to be honest and staff were not very helpful. Taxis are readily available at the taxi rank right outside the hotel which is useful but make sure you have cash on you for the taxis as most of them do not take credit cards. There is a swimming pool and deck area at the hotel but it doesn't look like anyone uses it much and is always empty. I didn't try out these facilities so can't comment apart from the fact the pool looked quite small. Stayed here on a business trip and the conference rooms/facilities were great and staff very helpful and nice at the business centre, however, I wouldn't really recommend this hotel for a holiday stay - there are far more hotels much closer to the centre or Port Olympic area which are only a 10 minute walk into town.

Our view from the 23rd floor was stunning as we were facing the Sea. Didn't want to ever close the blinds :) Service: desk staff is extremely helpful, as is the concierge. They also speak English, Spanish and Catalan, among others; no matter what you speak, you will find someone at this hotel who speaks it. Bar service: keep in mind you are not in America any more. This is not a ding at the hotel at all. They do it different in Spain than we do in the States. Do not go expecting American-style service. If you sit in the bar area, someone will serve you, and they will be polite and helpful, but it won't be as fast or overly-bubbly as you're used to in the US. Food and beverage choices: you're in Barcelona. Go eat somewhere else. The menu is 80% the same Hilton menu you will find all over the world, and the same quality. There is nothing wrong with it. But if you're in one ofthe great food cities in the world, go explore and try something you've never had before. The 15th Floor Executive Lounge is well worth the upgrade charge if you don't get it free from your Hilton status. It has a very large wrap-around deck which is great for cocktail hour if it's not too windy; self-serve bar after 5pm or so; smoking is allowed on the deck AND it's windy enough that if you're a non-smoker, your smoking neighbors won't bother you; very nice selection of snacks during cocktail hour and great breakfast.

The room was booked by my boyfriend's father using his HHonors points. My boyfriend was on leave from Afghanistan so we were very excited about this trip and I was very hopeful after reading the positive reviews. Before I get to the negative - a tip for people who want wifi. They charge 35 euro (or 39? something ridiculous) for wifi access. I found a cheaper option as the hotel is also a Boingo wireless hotspot. You can login at boingo.com and it is only $19.95 /day which is not free, but beats the 35 euro you would pay for the same service from Swisscom. The mall across the street also has free wifi for 30 min. I have to say that the some of the front desk staff can be very rude and inefficient. We extended our stay by one night for the first stay and somehow it didn't register in their computers. We were locked out of our room so we went to the front desk. We spoke to a nice (albeit completely hopeless) gentleman and showed him on my iphone the confirmation with confirmation number and other details. We said we can print this out, but he said \"the business center is closed\" (it is only open mon-fri) and didn't tell us we could print it out on a public computer in the lobby. So I used up more of my data plan sending him the email confirmation. He said it would take \"awhile\" for the email to go through (not sure what email system they are using, but okay) so he would let us wait in our hotel room. We had plans that night and figured the wait would be short. We were wrong. An hour later he called and said we would have to pay for the room. I asked him about the confirmation I sent about the change and he said they couldn't figure it out. I told him he would have to speak to my boyfriend who was in the shower at the time and he said he would call back. 15 minutes later her called back to say everything was worked out and we would not have to re-pay for that night. I can't imagine why they took an hour and a half to find our reservation after we sent them and showed them the confirmation number, but of course no apologies. It seems they are used to complaints. The second time we stayed there we had a different room facing another building. Our first room was lovely and faced the ocean. Our second room, 706, was missing the kettle part of the hot water kettle, the bathroom door kept getting jammed closed and the electrical socket in the bathroom was loose. The towel rack in the shower was falling off and hanging at a precarious angle. We ordered room service the first day and it was awful. The burger looked like a frozen one that had been microwaved, not the juicy Hilton burger on the pictures. The lasagna was frozen in the center. It ended up being about 80 euro total. They also (inexplicably) charged us the for the two calls we made to room service. We also ate once in the hotel restaurant for breakfast and it was 40 euro a person for the mediocre continental breakfast. Definitely go across the street for food instead. The maid service was also ... not great. Sometimes they would leave the box of tea and coffee, sometimes they would take it away, sometimes they would replace the dirty coffee mugs with clean ones, sometimes not. One day we decided to spend at day at the hotel relaxing and put up the do not disturb sign. Housekeeping called us to say we had the do not disturb sign up, when would we be leaving so they could clean our room? We told them not to worry about it, but I wonder if they call every person who has the do not disturb sign up. It kind of defeats the purpose of putting up the sign. The hotel has a lovely view and we found riding the metro to downtown easy.

So when we walked into our huge room at the Hilton, it seemed extremely luxurious. I was thrilled to get this hotel on Hotwire for $125/night since the regular rates were around $400 for our dates. I knew it was on the outskirts of the city, but that was fine with me because it was still close to public transport. We arrived at Barcelona airport and took a cab to the hotel, which costed 28 euros. Check in was easy and the staff gave us a map and showed us where most of the main attractions were. The room was very spacious, modern and clean. The bed was a little on the hard side, which isn't my preference, but I had no trouble sleeping during the stay. The bathroom was also large with a great tub and robes to use during our stay. There is a great pool and patio area downstairs, which we enjoyed. There is also a small gym next to the pool area. The location is not in the center of the city, but it is very easy to access any other area. The subway is a couple blocks away, about a 10 minute walk. We used the subway frequently during our stay and had no problems getting around the city and no problems with pickpockets, which I read about before the trip. There is also a mall across the street from the hotel, which was convenient for food and snacks if you don't want to take the subway downtown. If you enjoy gelato, try Giovanni's in the mall on the top floor. The gelato was delicous and I went there almost every day. The staff at this hotel was extremely helpful. I hadn't done too much research before going to Barcelona, so we consulted the staff daily for restaurant recommendations and directions. They were very nice and gave us good recommendations for different types of food around the city. Our favorite area to eat was the beach at Port Olimpic. I can't remember the name of the restaurant where we ate, but there are a bunch of restaurants right on the beach, which were really nice and reasonably priced. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. The only drawback for some would be the location, which wasn't a problem for me.

We found Russell (who's from England) was very helpful at the concierge from suggesting restuarants to the best way to get in and out of the city. He suggested we get a T10 card which allows 10 trips on all the various transport systems. We used the bus system to get into the city, the bus stop across the road from the hotel (route 41) will take you into Placa De Catuluna.

The best one I found was the Discover Barcelona package, which was cheaper than any other advance pay rate (\u20ac107.50 pn), and includes breakfast, a bottle of Champagne, Barcelona City card (free public transport) and 1,000 extra points. Not sure how long this rate will be available, but found it only was available when going in as described above, it was not shown when booking it the normal way on the Hilton site.

We spent 5 days in the city before relocating here for 3 days prior to picking up our rental car and heading north. We had seen all the sights and we were ready for some 'down\" time. Check-in was smooth and my preference for free internet access as a Gold Hilton Honors member had been noted. As an aside, many reviews ago there was a rant about a failure to provide an upgrade to a Hilton Honors member. One has to be Gold to be upgraded. I purposely changed my preference to free internet access and it has been honored. As I write this review,I am sitting in room 1612 overlooking the pool deck with obstructed view of the sea due to 3 buidlings immediately in front of the hotel. This morning we walked the beach promenade. Beach access is less than a two block walk. The promenade stretches for several miles south to the port. There are walkers, runners and bikers galore. One can rent beach chairs and umbrellas from the concession stands along the beach. The locals flock to this beach on the weekends. Be advsied that one section of the beach is a nude beach. Love the Europeans! We spent the aftenoon on the hotel pool deck, which is quite large. Towels are provided and there is a bar and outdoor dining. There is a large number of chaises. Finding one is not a problem. Unlike many US and Mexican operations, food and beverage are not delivered outside the dining/bar area. The pool is OK. It is not interesting or particularly large; a simple, tiled rectangle with a maximum depth of 1.55 meters. Outdoor showers are located at each end of the pool. We had lunch at the poolside dining area. A chef grills on site. The large hamburger seemed to be a favorite. We had their club sandwich with a Catalonian flair. It was very good and freshly made. This is our only dining experience in the hotel. A word about the hypermarket, Alcampos, in the mall across the street. On the lowest level of the mall is the supermarket portion of the store. A level above is the housewares, lawn, garden, ie. center of the store. Each has a separate entrance. If you need to buy a corkscrew after purchasing wine, you must leave the supermarket, enter the mall, go up a flight and enter on the second floor. Odd to say the least. The supermarket is gigantic. Many guests from the hotel cross the street to buy breakfast items, bottles of water, etc. One last piece of info. The store accepts Visa and MasterCard only. Carry your passport as they demand it and a copy is not accepted. From my experience, the staff do not speak English. The rooms are a good size. We have a king bed, plenty of storage space and a large closet. The bath room is decent with a separate WC that includes a bidet. Typical for Europe, the shower is a tub shower. I have yet to learn why the soaking tubs are so narrow here. The selection of English speaking TV channels is very good,but the TV is a very small; flat screen.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peachtree City, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel but not near tourist attractions\u201d", "Author": "bbeerbower", "ReviewID": "UR72072558", "Content": "This is my 2nd stay in Barcelona.

However, this hotel is not near the main tourist attractions so you have to take the bus or metro. This is a lovely hotel not far from the beach and right across from one of the nicest malls in Barcelona. There is a metro & bus service 2 blocks away along the Diagonal Avenue. The beach is close enough to walk to and there are several interesting parks along the way. This entire area is being developed and seems to be the \"new Barcelona\". We used Hitlon rewards points and were able to upgrade to larger rooms which included the business lounge and free snacks & breakfast. Otherwise breakfast was quite expensive and if I had to pay for breakfast, I'd go across the street to the mall which had several nice restaurants & a grocery store (lower level). The rooms were clean and beds comfortable. Check in and out was fast and the employees were very friendly and helpful. The staff in fact was exceptional.

It is unfortunately quite far from everything being outside the city centre and we found taxis were the only real option. One day we walked along the beaches into the centre of Barcelona which was a pleasant walk but took a long time. The Internet in this hotel is an absolute disgrace, plain and simple. \u20ac25 per night for a bandwidth-throttled connection? We ended up paying more for the Business Connection which was allegedly unlimited. At almost \u20ac30 per night this is really shocking. Provided by Swisscom I believe, so if you can arrange a roaming agreement with them before you travel I'd advise this. There is absolutely no free internet anywhere we could find, including in the Executive Lounge. There are 2 PCs in the lounge but again you have to pay to use these - shockingly. The canap\u00e9s in the lounge in the evening were poor. There was 1 white wine, 1 red, some cava and beers and soft drinks. The minibar was of course obscenely priced and we didn't order from room service. There is a mall across the road with a very large supermarket where you can buy drinks etc. Service again lets a hotel down. In the case of this hotel I got the impression from staff that they were incredulous that we dared to ask any questions or requests and would often laugh when we asked questions on check-in etc. The concierge was no real use - having requested she book us a restaurant by the water, with good food being more important than price, we were sent to La Gavina (I have also reviewed) which was the worst restaurant we've been to in years. I can only assume they have an arrangement which overrides any need to care for customers' needs. The breakfast was 'just ok'. The restaurant was not busy at all (3 tables) and had no atmosphere. The staff however seemed pressured and unfriendly. We are entitled to breakfast as we are Diamond VIP HHonors members, and were told we could have it in the Executive Lounge. In every other Hilton we've had the right to choose whether you want to eat here or in the restaurant, but in this property we actually had to fight to be able to choose which just was not good customer service. Another benefit of HHonors status is the upgrade at check-in. Even although the hotel was very empty, we were given the bare minimum upgrade to a standard room on the Executive Floor. When we asked if there were Superior Rooms available we were told we'd have to pay \u20ac25 extra per night for that. Again, this sort of attitude isn't going to leave a good impression on valued customers and I've never seen this attitude in other Hiltons. Not a great property for upgrades!

The Diagonal Mar is further out from all the action, but so close to the Mediterranean that I booked it hoping for an upgrade due to our Gold status iwth Hilton. Bless them, they came through- a room on the 21st floor with a view of the sea, and Executive Lounge access. This was on a reward stay too, which is typical of how well the European Hiltons treat their HHonors members. The hotel is in a district with a large convention center and a giant mall. The mall across the street from the hotel, is actually a very good feature- it even has a grocery store (Al Campo) with a full liquor selection, a lot of franchises if you want quick but not distinguished food (Starbucks and McD's are good for free Wi-Fi to circumvent Hilton's exorbitant Internet charges) as well as some better restaurants. I even bought some Majorca pearl earrings at an Internet kiosk in the mall, figuring the place was likely to be reputable if not the cheapest around. It's a short walk to a beach on the Mediterranean, a walk I took every day while my husband got some rest. Our room was clean, comfortable and a good size and the view was heavenly. We didn't try the bar, restaurant or Fitness Center. Nor did I try the outdoor pool, although it looked beautiful and was huge. This was mid-May and too cold for a swim. I somehow forgot to get a picture of the actual room; I hope you can get an idea of the room size/layout from other reviews. The lounge provided a good selection of food at breakfast and from 6 to 8:30 PM, as well as afternoon tea. We were never there for the latter, but thoroughly enjoyed the lounge. Both breakfast and evening snacks were substantial and varied enough to constitute a light meal. My only complaint is the Internet rates, as usual. I was traveling with a Blackberry and an iPod Touch and like to get a full-size keyboard once in awhile. (The Blackberry also has limited access to some sites since my employer supplied it.) Free Wi-Fi was not available at all- not in the lobby or the lounge. The best they could do was the computers in the lounge, which were 35 Euro cents per minute, and we wouldn't have had that option if we hadn't had lounge access. So, I did run up a bill of about 40 Euros for Internet service during our stay but spent most of my on-line time at Starbucks across the street with the iPod, or on the Blackberry. Having just come from a hotel in Madrid that cost less and included Free Wi-Fi, I don't see why Hilton has to use such an expensive service and pass it on to the customers.

The negatives: We had requested a no smoking room. The original room they gave us was a lovely corner room but it smelled like smoke. When we went down to see if we could switch they offered us another room but it wasn't as nice. So we stayed in our original room and asked them to open our windows and we let the room air out for the day. It made a difference and for the next 6 nights we were extremely comfortable. The hotel is not in the center and after a full day of sightseeing, it can be tiring to resort to the very hot subway or expensive to take cabs everywhere. Internet access was very expensive. The positives: There is a big shopping center across the street with a suburban supermarket. It was fun buying groceries in another country. We had breakfast in our room every morning and stockpiled bottled water. We were able to save a lot of money this way. Also, there was a cafe in the mall and McDonalds which had free wifi if you bought something. We never went to McDonalds but the cafe inside the mall was nice. Only a few blocks from the sea and close to all the seaside restaurants which was a lot of fun to go to. The hotel has a very nice outdoor pool which was relaxing after sightseeing. The reception/concierge people were extremely nice and very helpful. The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfortable. There is a subway stop nearby. Something you may not know: Remember to check your bill! If you move something in the refridgerator there is a sensor and it thinks you are eating it so it will show up on your bill. Just let the front desk know and they will take care of it. We really did enjoy our stay this hotel. :-) Suggestions: Enforce no smoking Keep the pool open an hour later. Dinner is so late in Barcelona and the few times we went to the pool we had to plan it because of how early it closed. (The first time we tried but it was closed) It would have been amazing if we had that extra hour. As far as value goes, we used Hilton Honor Points so we were extremely satisfied.

It's 2 miles from the city center but still feels much a like its in the city. The city center is a quick subway ride away. It is one block away from the beach. + The mall across the street is convenient as it has a nice grocery store and a few decent restaurants. I just have a few suggestions that would have made this hotel stay perfect. They are: + The Internet is way too expensive. They charge 27 euros ($40 USD) a day! I have never paid so much for internet in NYC, Hong Kong, Paris, London, etc! Internet should be free but if you do charge- it should be $10 to $15. It's shockingly expensive! + The pool beautiful but it is ICE cold. I like cold pools- but it is so cold, you can not swim.

By the time we arrived at the hotel, it was around 7.30pm, there were no porters available, so we brought our luggage up ourselves to reception. Check in was smooth and we were allocated an upgraded room on the 26th floor. The room was light and airy with a king bed and nice furnishings. Shortly after we booked, we were contacted by the hotel to advise that their executive lounge would be closed for refurbishment, however they were happy to offer us free internet use and vouchers for free drinks at the lounge bar. We were advised that our luggage would be brought up to our room shortly. Indeed about 10 minutes later the porter arrived with our luggage. He apologised that he was not outside to meet us as he had taken a short break. It was nice of him to apologise. Once settled, we went downstairs for a drink and met an American couple who were also taking a cruise the next day, although on a different ship from us. We were given a couple of drinks vouchers when we checked in and I offered these to the barman when I went to the bar. He said that he would take care of that later and that he would brink our drinks over. This is how the evening continued. We sat with the American couple chatting for a very pleasant couple of hours during which time the barman kept bringing over drinks. About 11pm we decided to go to bed, I gave the barman 10 Euro and asked if he wanted our vouchers, he thanked me for the tip and said, he would take care of everything. We let the vouchers on the table and went to bed very happy. We had a great nights sleep, the bed was comfortable and the a/c worked fine. Breakfast was very good indeed. Staff were very friendly and efficient and the choice of food was excellent, all the usual items were there, along with several Spanish dishes. After breakfast, we went back to our room and packed as were were booked for one more night in another hotel before our cruise on 23rd Dec. We called down for a porter and one arrived quickly and took our luggage to the lobby. We went down and chcked out. Again everything went smoothly. The porter called us a cab and loaded our luggage into the boot for us, I gave hime something his trouble and we went on our way.

It was great because we could close that door and still be able to enter each other's rooms with privacy. The rooms (one with a king bed and the other with 2 double beds) were very spacious and extremely clean. The bathrooms were HUGE with a separate tub and shower. Above the tub was a long window overlooking the city that was beautiful! The rooms also had big fluffy bath robes and slippers :) The mini fridge was stocked - but watch out...expensive! We were given 2 complimentary bottles of water daily. Look over your bill carefully when checking out...we were charged for mini-fridge items everyday when none were ever used. Apparently if you move an item in the fridge it registers that it was removed. The pool area was very nice. Good sized pool and never a problem to find a lounger, plenty of towels provided as well. The bar and grill area at the pool looked very nice, however after seeing that 1 glass (!) of Sangria cost 10 euro's we decided to go to the gigantic supermarket in the mall across the street to purchase our own drinks and snacks to have at the pool and in the room. The gym was also nice, modern, clean, and with a good selection of equipment. The mall across the street has plenty of places to have something like a croissant and coffee for breakfast, and enough different restaurant choices to have lunch. It is MUCH less expensive than dining at the hotel!!! We found it very convenient that the Metro station was less than a 5 min. walk and only a few stops to downtown. It is easy to purchase tickets from the vending machine (in english as well) and we normally purchased the T-10 tickets. The beach is a 5 min. walk from the hotel and was clean and the water was nice and clear as well. The only negative that I could find with this hotel is that I wanted to use the internet in the lobby and it was often down. When it was up and running I was unable to use the \"charge to room\" feature and would have had to use a credit card. The hotel's internet is EXTREMELY expensive!!!

We stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for 3 days/2 nights and then boarded a cruise ship for a Western Med 7 night cruise. We are a family of 4 (53,50,19 and 17). We booked 2 rooms, one a king and the other a twin room for the girls. We got a terrific price on a January sale thru the Hilton Website and was able to get these rooms w/ full Hilton breakfasts for everyone for $499 American Dollars for the 2 nights(and average of $125/per room/per night including full breakfast and VAT) BTW, the Hilton breakfast costs 24 Euros pp if bought separately. The Hilton looks to be a pretty new hotel. Nice entrance and modern lobby. One of our rooms was available immediately while the other became available at about 2pm. We quickly stored our luggage in the room, washed up, rested a bit after a long flight from New York and headed to the Beach which was about 200 yards from the Hotel. The Hilton is a bit away from the action but you had several easy options. One you can take the HOHO bus located across the street. You can also take the metro which was on the other side of the mall which was directly across the street. Or, you can do what we did, which was get a cab to take us to the center of the action and attractions. First of all, the Taxi from the airport for a party of 4 with lots of luggage came to 35 Euros. The taxi to and from La Rambla was approximately 10 Euros. You can eat, shop and go to the movies (if you want) at the mall across the street. There were a few authenic Spanish restuarants as well as fast food places. After the beach we took a cab to La Rambla, returned early evening and swam in the pool at the hotel. Nice pool, great water temperature, food and drinks available. Plenty of loungers. The next day we took the Gaudi bus tour and visited the Picasso museum. The rooms were quite nice. We were given 2 rooms that a private entrance. You go thru one door and then it opens up to 2 separate hotel rooms. The twin room was nice sized with marble bathroom and an oceanview. Our king room was huge with tub and separate shower. Only problem we had was keys hardly ever worked and we forced to exchange keys often. When we checked in we asked if we could have access to executive lounge since we were celebrating our 25th anniversary. Woman behind desk said we could but for an additional 80 Euros. We declined but they did offer us a complimentary bottle of wine. All in all we had a very nice stay. Orbitz, Travelocity and Expedia rate this hotel 5 stars. I would rate it 4 stars due to it's lack of a concierge, no free internet and slow elevators.

If I was paying I would not stay here again simply due to the location. The hotel was perfectly fine it is just away from the action and you will spend 20 minutes each day commuting to the real attractions. With that being said there is very little I can add that other reviews have not already mentioned, but I will try. The hotel is sort of a hybrid business hotel. It does have an incredible pool area which gives it the hybrid feel. The lobby, staff, room service were all terrific. The room was kind of minimalist, almost on the no personality end. It was clean and comfortable. We were on the 13th floor and had a view of the sea that was nice, however I think I would have prefered a view of Barcelona. The beach is not the kind of beach you'd want to walk to and definately not a reason to stay here. There is a fitness center and it was mediocre. The location is in a suburb but there is a metro station about 2 blocks away. It is the Forum stop on the Yellow line (for all those people that like to figure out what they are doing ahead of time). Using the metro was VERY convenient and was totally comfortable and inexpensive. Barcelona's metro is the most user friendly of all the subway's I've used. Buy a T10 ticket from the touch screen vending machine in the subway entrance. It is good for 10 trips and can be shared by as many people until it is used up. The mall across from the hotel was convenient. There was a massive heat wave that hit the city during our visit and I was able to go to the mall and buy nice sandals and shorts on the spot. By the way, my wife is very fashion conscious and she dropped a few penny's in some of the unique designer boutiques in the mall. The mall has several places to eat that were frequented by locals but all of them had the chain feel. Like a TGI Fridays...When you are exhausted from exploring its a better option than eating at the hotel. In the basement of the mall there is also a grocery store in case you need anything. Also..There is a Starbucks in the mall on the second floor on the edge of the food court but it doesn't open until 10AM.

The largest shopping mall in Barcelona is directly across the street from the hotel. There is a great restaurant called Free Way on the outdoor terrace where there is a 14 euro/pp dinner buffet with salad bar, tapas (jamon serrano, cheeses, olives), desserts, and best of all, truly fresh meats and seafoods you order to be grilled for you.

There were other types of fish, crayfish, cuttlefish, squid and other local sea things to be grilled along with beef, chicken, pork sausages, etc. with chimicurri and churrasco sauces, etc. On the other side of the mall is the Metro station. Underground there is a Metro train and aboveground there is a tram. It is cheap and easy to get to anywhere you want to go in the city. Yes, it is not in downtown, but the area is clean, the mall gives you shopping and dining options, and you can sunbathe and swim on the walking-distance beach. The hotel bar and restaurant are attractive (but expensive, as in most all hotels). The fitness center was decent sized and had great equipment, the pool deck had plenty of chair and the pool itself was quite attractive. There is even a human-sized chess set on the pool deck.

The room is quite spacious with an Ottoman chair in the corner as well as a working area. The Hotel was very clean and bed sheets were changed everyday. The bathroom is of decent size. There is a jet bath with a tv in the wall (although you can't really hear it if you have the jets on as it's VERY loud. There is a separate shower too. Design of the room is very calming with nice calming colours. The hotel is directly opposite a shopping centre with a variety of restaurants and shops. A Primark was opening there on 8th June 2009. The shopping centre is open daily from 10am to 10pm although not too sure about Sunday. Inside the centre is also an Alcampo shop where you can get any type of groceries or household goods. I did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on their food although everything was VERY pricey. A bottle of water costs EURO 4 for 500ml and EURO 7 for a bottle of beer. They did provide 2 complimentary bottles of water everyday which was good. We spent most of the days by the pool which was nice. Beach towels are provided. There are a number of sunbed by the pool (on the 2nd floor) and also other beds away from the pool. I spent mos mornings in the gym. The gym isn't the biggest but I found that there was never anymore than 4 people in it at any one time. There are 3 running machines, 3 crosstrainers and 2 rowers. There are also quite a few machines and a lot of free weights too. We got to the hotel by train. As mentioned by other reviewers, you should get a T10 ticket which can be used by any number of people but with a total number of 10 times. It takes up to 1 hr and 30 mins to get from airport to the hotel. The RENFE from the airport to Passeig De Gracia takes approx 25 mins and then you have to walk to the metro station L4 (yellow line) which is about 10 mins. Then it's 9 stops to El Maresme Forum and then about 5 mins walk to the hotel. It is quite hard work if you have lots of bags as there are lots of stairs.

Best thing about this hotel is its location if you want get some sleep at night and relax, which is just what you can do - it's not near the Ramblas but in the northeastern end of town a couple blocks from the beach. Just a few blocks from the El Maresme Forum metro station and the no. 7 bus line goes right from the hotel to Placa de Catalunya. Very easy to get to all the sights in town. Helpful hint: don't attempt to drag your luggage through the Barcelona metro system especially if you have a lot of it as there are few escalators and lifts, and you'll be lugging it up and down endless stairs and transfer tunnels. Hilton hotel staff reminded us of the actors on the BBC Hotel Babylon series: they were great fun and very helpful with directions, and quite obviously crazy in their off hours; as this was low season, they had a lot of free time on their hands to go wild behind closed doors, and they did! We speak Spanish and because of this one of the breakfast servers explained to us how to get tickets to the Sunday evening bullfights held at the Barcelona bull ring, which was awesome. The hotel is only 2 years old, has an outdoor pool (although too cold to swim in April), nice gym, locker rooms, and saunas. It's located across from a big indoor shopping mall with everything in it, including a huge Alcampo store for anything you would need: toiletries, food, drinks, wine, you name it. One night we did a picnic and bought fois gras, cooked shrimp, french bread, olives, and wine from the Alcampo all for about 10 Euros. The hotel breakfast was American-oriented with eggs, sausage, and a large cold buffet with lots of choices. Barcelona has a rough side and we avoided the narrow dark alleys around the Ramblas at night as pickpocketing and muggings are common. If you stay to the lighted areas it is ok. Barcelona is also very transient, with lots of folks from all over Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The metro was always packed with scummy, partied-out 20-somethings, and if you brushed up against them you'd want to take a shower afterward to prevent catching any number of skin or other diseases or bugs. One drawback about the Hilton is the far too expensive internet access, which is typical of European hotels. We punted on this and found a mujahideen internet cafe about 3 blocks from the hotel that cost 1 Euro an hour. If you get to Barcelona go see Montserrat, which is about an hour out of town by commuter train. It's magnificent. The Hilton Diagonal Mar is a great choice for a hotel and I would definitely stay there again and recommend to friends. It's one of the best in Barcelona and up there with the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Arts, which has become a bit shabby in the last few years anyway, at twice the cost of the Hilton.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cHappy Hilton.\u201d", "Author": "w_collins40", "ReviewID": "UR29358150", "Content": "Great hotel,modern, spacious rooms, well equipped with the usual from Hilton.

I travel 80% of the time for business, stay at any number of Hilton and Hilton family hotels every year, and can honestly say this is the best I have ever been treated at any hotel. My stay was booked on hotel points, and like other reviewers I was given the upgrade to the Executive floor. As a veteran of many Executive lounges in the US I can tell you that my expectations weren't set too high, but they were easily exceeded and then some. Breakfast, drinks & tapas certainly helped to make this a very affordable stop on my tour of Spain! The staff were friendly and courteous, and genuinely helpful with directions and advice on how to get the most out of my stay. Imagine rounding the corner from the elevator to an enthusiastic personal greeting from Patrick, your concierge, and being directed to take your pick of any table and oh yes - what's your drink of choice? If it's not too hot head outside to enjoy the view of both sea & city, and wait for Patrick to do all the work checking you in! Once you can tear yourself away, head to your room to revel in it's modern appointments - if you need it and it's not already there just pick up the phone and I'm sure they'll get it for you. The housekeeping was respectful and attentive - I especially enjoyed the turn down service & little card with the next day's weather forcast - a nice touch! On my last day I left my luggage at the hotel while touring around before a late flight out, and when I arrived back at the hotel wilted from the summer heat I headed to the fitness center to freshen up. The housekeeper working in that area set me up to have a shower & change with as much comfort as possible in the somewhat cramped locker room - it was clear she just wanted me to be happy! I enjoyed the pool & lounge area - including an ice-cold towel at the exact moment when I thought I could not stand the heat for another second - how did they do that?! I didn't take advantage of the spa services, although they were certainly tempting. Although initially concerned that the location was a bit out of the way, it was no problem at all thanks to the bus touristic and metro across the street. It was great to be able to amble over to the beach as easily as hop on a train to the center of the action - love having a choice! The shopping center across the street offers good options to the somewhat pricey on-site dining options, if you can't be bothered to venture into the heart of town for some turly divine cuisine. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this property and would happily recommend it as a nice little refuge from the hustle & bustle of Barcelona! If you're booking your stay on points you will receive much more bang for your buck, so to speak, than using the same number of points at properties in the US.

Got a really good rate direct which was less than half the rack rate and although it said it did not include breakfast I was told that it did when we arrived. The rooms are very large and come as they are shown on the website. Request a high floor as we stayed on the 18th floor and the view was amazing. The hotel is less than 3 years old and so everything is still new and is much better than the other Hilton in Barcelona which is much older. The front desk were very helpful and as you would expect all spoke perfect English. They were happy to help and no request was too much trouble. The gym is small but well equipped and the pool is very nice to relax in. The location is away from the main centre of the city but this is very much in its favour as Barcelona is not too big and there is a metro station (El Maresme Forum) 5 mins away through the large shopping centre opposite the hotel. It is also on the tram route. There is also a nice beach nearby and the location is very peaceful and safe. I have not stayed in the centre but from going round there at night it is probably very busy. There is a large supermarket in the shopping centre which is very convenient as drinks are very pricey in the Hilton although they do supply you with 2 bottles of free water everyday. The open topped tourist buses also stop opposite the hotel and they are worth the 20 euros for a day ticket. They are a good way to get your bearings of were the sights are and we actually got to use a lot of the vouchers they give you with your ticket. So it is better to use this bus early in your stay. The Hotel is on the green route which is the shortest of the tourist bus routes but you can switch to the red and blue routes which cover all the sights. It is worth going on all three routes in one day then going back to the sights you really want to spend time at. You'll definitely want to visit the Sagrada Familia, try to get there reasonably early as it does get busy and definitely go up in the lift the views you get of Barcelona and the details of the building are easily worth the money. The spiral stair case on the way down is a sight to behold but you can get the lift if you are scared of heights. After this Gaudi's Casa Batillo on the Passieg de Garcia was the most memorable sight we visited and well worth putting aside an afternoon for. There are lots of places to eat in Barcelona just be aware some close in August and most will close either Sunday or Monday as well. I would recommend Can Paxiano, Carrer de la Reina Cristina, if you need a snack and are near Barceloneta. There is no sign and it is surrounded by electronic stores but the atmosphere is busy and always full of tourists an locals alike. Just fight your way to the bar and order two glasses of the rose cava and a bocadilllo or tapas and that will keep you going for a while, the pork, ham and liver pate bocadillo was amazing (lomo, foie y york) worth the trip alone. Barcelona was an amazing place and probably needs a full week to do it justice and we would definitely go back and stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cJaw dropping excellence\u201d", "Author": "NC1313", "ReviewID": "UR18559456", "Content": "We booked through Priceline and got an already amazing deal ($100/night), but when we checked in the young lady at the counter (Juana) offered us a very smart upgrade.

That wasn't a fancy name to make us feel better about spending the extra money it was actually quite the cost savings. Everyday we were served breakfast and tapas that easily worked as lunch and dinner. Not to mention a full open bar, and plenty of teas and coffees. My friend and I were blown away. We would still go out later in the evening to either Las Ramblas or Port Olympico and have something to eat so we had tasted the local paella and other dishes, but saving the money on most of our food and drinks was just perfect. The views were breathtaking, the beds were all consuming comfortable, the bathroom came with robes and slippers, the maids had to have come in 4 or 5 times a day. If we ate the chocolate on our pillows, they came in and replaced them! It's like they knew when we were in and when we were out. I only got to spend one afternoon by the pool, but it was amazing. From masseurs walking around offering 5 minute massages and a bar 10 steps away, I couldn't have been happier. The hotel was close to the underground station as well as a Hop on Hop off Bus point so public transportation was great.

This property is not located on Avenue Diagonal, but the other Hilton property is - only it's 10km or so to the northwest of where you really want to be. Unfortunately we were dropped first at the wrong property, then had to cab it down Avenue Diagonal to the correct hotel. It was a nice tour but another \u20ac20 that I would have preferred not to have spent. I learned later that the tram runs all the way down Avenue Diagonal and would have been much less expensive than the taxi fare.

The hotel is a tall building with great views of the city, however be aware that a sea view involves looking at the sea in between a couple of very large, close office blocks behind the hotel. The bedroom was contemporary and clean whith a very stylish bathroom. Space was not a problem anywhere in this hotel, if anything, they had too much of it (July is a quiet time for business hotels such as this one) and it felt a bit empty. We tried the bar after dinner one night, and though it was dissapointingly empty, we braved the high prices and tried out the cocktails - great friendly service, though watch out for the upselling. The pool and decking area were fantastic, and once we got over the feeling we were sandwiched between tower blocks, we enjoyed both swimming and food at the poolside bar. We glanced at the restaurant menu and decided to give its extortionate prices a wide berth (30 euros for one main course, a two course meal for two with a drink would have cost over 100 euros). There are plenty of average restaurants out on the shopping centre complex next door, though I highly recommend wandering around the old streets of Barri Gotic at around 9pm when all the local Catalan restaurants come to life.

Hotel facilities for children. We asked for and got 2 child cots which worked well. Child menu at restaurant with spaghetti, etc at a reasonable hotel cost. Pool is for adults and was a bit cold, but our 2 year old enjoyed it. 3. Places to Play . There's a couple of parks in the area. Behind the conference center is a little park with slide, swings and some other little surprises. On weekends, they set up a little fair with blow up play things (our child calls them jump jumps), a little train, a track with peddle cars and a little bungee jump thing. To the side of the hotel and mall there is another park with a little playground with some wooden playthings and some pieces the kids can jump on that make sound (different tones). There's also a little play area in the mall and you can pay 2 Euro to push your kid around in a shopping cart/car. All in all, I thought it worked well. 4. Places to eat for kids. There aren't a whole lot of restaurants in the area, but if your kids are used to eating earlier (like ours are), nothing is open anyway. We were happy to have the mall across the street b/c we could get food for the kids. There are several decent restaurants where you can sit outside and enjoy a meal and a pitcher of Sangria. Not the best of Spain, but kids can run around and nobody is disturbed. While we were there, they had a pool set up with kayaks and a track with tricycles and peddle cars. 5. Getting to sights. There's a metro in walking distance (we didn't try it), taxis in front of the hotel, and a tourist bus that stops a half block down the road. We took the tourist bus one day and liked it for the overview of the city, but it was not so convenient with kids. We had to change buses several times and in the more popular areas, wait in long lines. After we did this one day, we took taxis after that. It's a bit more expensive and it takes a bit more time to get places, but it wasn't a problem for us. Zoo and Acquarium/IMAX were close by (5-10 minutes). Some of the bigger taxis (vans) have fold down child booster car seats built in (for toddlers only). 6. Shopping. there are several kids related stores (toys-r-us, imaginarium, etc.) in the mall and a big supermarket. We liked this b/c we needed to do some shopping for the kids. 7. Laundry. Found a local place down the street (directly across from the hotel, past the mall) that does laundry at 3 euro a Kilo. Compared to the hotel, a steal and laundry was done next day and done well.

There is a lot of building work in progress so this is definitely an area that is on the up. As has been said before the hotel is only a short stroll from the Metro and the journey to the Ramblas district is only a few stops and this is certainly the easiest way to get around the area. We found that the restaurants outside the shopping centre were disappointing and quite expensive but we did find an excellent place called Man Go which is just a block away from the hotel near the rear of the shopping centre. There is a great selection of meals and tapas at reasonable prices and a good selections of wines. The spinach with honey and raisins was superb and the paella was great value and extremely tasty. As frequent guests at Hiltons we were upgraded to an Executive room on the 23rd floor and we checked in at the Executive Lounge. The room was not particularly big but had everything we needed for a weekend stay. We were provided with complimentary water and some pastries as well as other usual amenities. The Lounge is of a decent size and has a balcony if you want to enjoy the sunshine but the lounge can get very crowded at peak times. At times the staff were rushed off their feet but they were all very friendly and helpful. On our first night the lounge was full of people who had just finished a cruise and it was so crowded that we only stayed for one drink. There is a good selection of food and drinks in the evening although there can be a crush around the food at times. The breakfast selection is good but the hot selection is pretty poor. Biggest complaint is that there is only coffee machine and there can be a long queue at times. A second machine would certainly reduce the waiting time which was sometimes ten minutes. The rooftop pool is a great feature of the hotel and there is plenty of seating as well as a poolside restaurant and bar. The pool was a little chilly but certainly invigorating! On our second night we returned to our room to find a note advising us that a Dance Festival would be in progress from 6PM until 6AM that evening. Despite being on the top floor we had a completely sleepless night and we heard many people complaining about the noise the following morning. On returning home we had already received an email from Guest Relations thanking us for our stay. I replied that the hotel was very good but our relaxing weekend had been ruined by the sleepless Saturday night. I really didn\u2019t expect any response but a couple of days later I received a mail from the GM apologising for our inconvenience and offering us a complimentary weekend so that they could look after us properly!

An hour's drive on the main highway up the coast will put you in the Costa Brava area. There you will find some of the most beautiful beaches you have ever seen. We left the hotel at 7AM and spent the entire day swimming in the Med, arriving back at the hotel 12 hours later.

The hotel building and all its facilities were wonderful, and fully up to the standard of a five star hotel. We especially loved the outdoor pool and lounge area. The room was spacious, and the only negative about it was the mattress, which was way too firm, so if you're very skinny, it will be uncomfortable. Also, internet access is only included if you bring your own laptop, so if you have to use the one in the lobby or the ones in the business center, there's a hefty per minute charge, which I found tacky. Why did I not rate this hotel higher? Because the people who work there are not up to the task of running a five star hotel. - We asked for turn down service, they forgot. - Another day I asked them to clean the bathroom floor, and came back to find that they hadn't done it. - Housekeeping kept rearranging the makeup in my beauty bag. - I asked for a hardboiled egg for breakfast; one day they forgot, another day, several different people brought me a total of four eggs. - The maitre d' claimed on the third day of our five day stay that breakfast was not included in our rate (which it was). We politely told him that it was, and asked him to please confirm with the front desk. He started a discussion! Can you believe it? In a five star hotel? He wanted us to sign a blank check, which we refused, and in the end we were allowed to have our included breakfast. After breakfast, he told us that we had been right all along, that breakfast was indeed included in our rate. We asked him to make sure to make a note of it so we wouldn't run into the same problem later. - Next day, new maitre d', we're told breakfast is not included in our rate... Same story all over again. - At check out, the receptionist presents us with a bill for two days of breakfast, because, as it turns out, the maitre d' has billed us for breakfast for the two days they messed up and the maitre d' has signed the check himself. We're appalled, but politely explain the situation, and what does the receptionist do? He starts another discussion, and he starts calling a bunch of people from the phone right in front of us. When he finally gets off the phone, he says that he will \"give us\" the breakfasts, as if he's doing us a favor, seeing as he seems to think that it is perfectly normal to book a five day stay with included breakfast on only three of the five days. I have never experienced a longer check out. I truly hope that someone high up in the Hilton chain reads this, and does something about this. The hotel itself is beautiful, it's certainly a five or six star on paper, but it's not even a one star in terms of service and staff training and communication. We only encountered one staff member that we thought did a good job, unfortunately I don't remember her name, but it was a female receptionist. Everyone else needs A LOT more training. Because of that, this is a hotel that people stay at once, and never return to. That's unfortunate; I don't know of any other place with such a good starting point that accomplishes to ruin everything so completely.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland, UK", "Title": "\u201cA 5 star treat\u201d", "Author": "Art4All", "ReviewID": "UR8192190", "Content": "Just back from a week's break at one of Barcelona's newest 5 star hotels. Selected the hotel on the strength of past reviews and as a Hilton Hhonor's member was aware of the benefits of booking one of their Executive Rooms. Although the hotel is large, 400+ rooms, it doesn't feel it and the hotel still has a newness about it. The rooms and public areas are spotlessly clean and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Other plusses are the excellent outdoor pool - one of the largest that I know of for a city centre hotel. Maybe not that suitable for young children but ideal for someone who wants to swim rather than splash - it makes a change! As with past reviewers, the location could be an issue for anyone wanting to be close to the action but the excellent, and cheap Metro gives you easy access to all the city sites. Having stayed in the city on more than one occasion before, the quiet location suited us perfectly; and for a city location the hotel is very, very quiet. Taxis are also plentiful, and cheap. A mid-day, midweek trip back to the airport in fairly heavy traffic was just \u00a320 ($40). Just one minor niggle though. The Executive Lounge was very busy, so much so that breakfast was a bit of a zoo. The Lounge is not that large and services about 6 large floors of Exec rooms. On a couple of occasions, and with no tables available we took ourselves down to the main Indigo Restaurant, where remarkably it was quiet, the food was great and it was an altogether more relaxing experience. During the rest of the day, the lounge (with open air terrace) was a great bonus - complimentary afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks and snacks are a nice touch and it's also open 'til 10.30pm. A great place to relax and unwind. If they can sort out the breakfast ritual, certainly when the hotel's near capacity (staff acknowledged there had been some minor problems but said these were being addressed), then the Diagonal Mar's pretty much faultless.

For that purpose, it was perfect. The hotel is new and clean. Nice pool area, although the pool itself is a little small. The beach is about 2 blocks away so that was very nice. Rooms were crisp and clean- flat screen TV, large closet space with safe, hairdryer, overall very nice. Not too much of a Spanish-feel, but it is a Hilton, so what can you expect. Food is surprisingly good at breakfast and the restaurant for dinner, although absurdly priced. The hotel is across the street from a shopping mall with many food-court restaurants, which was nice when you did not want to spend a fortune for a simple sandwich.

Our stay was strictly for pleasure. We picked this hotel because it\u2019s newly constructed and we generally prefer American style hotel rooms when traveling in Europe. Overall, we had a great stay at this hotel. Rooms: As I am a Hilton Honors member with Diamond status, we were upgraded to a corner room on one of the executive floors (5 of them in total). Rooms facing south and on high floors have a stellar view of the Mediterranean \u2013 those on the other side have a beautiful view of the city. Furnishings in room were first rate: 27\u201d (approx.) flat screen TV, wood floors, nice easy chair with ottoman, etc. Bathroom was also very nice with separate shower and bathtub. My wife appreciated the high powered hair dryer. I liked the big closet with safe. On our first night, the hotel provided a lovely welcome gift \u2013 a single-serving bottle of cognac and a small plate of desserts. Turn down service was provided on both nights. Executive Lounge: Probably the best executive lounge I\u2019ve ever been in. As the other reviews note, premium alcoholic beverages are provided from lunchtime until closing. Breakfast was fairly standard, but snack options in the afternoon and evening were GREAT. This usually included 2-3 hot items (i.e. potsickers with dipping sauce), 4-5 cold items (usually a couple of sweets, gourmet sandwiches, etc.), and a nice selection of typical finger foods (i.e. nuts and crackers). And we aren\u2019t talking freezer section stuff here \u2013 this is stuff that their kitchen was clearly preparing strictly for the lounge. Rarely do I consider the lounge something worth paying extra for but in this case, I would have gladly shelled out the additional amount for this privilege. If a little wind doesn\u2019t both you, the balcony area of the lounge has million dollar views of both the Mediterranean and the city. Transportation: If this hotel was in the States, you\u2019d say it was in the suburbs. Realistically, it\u2019s about 25-30 via public transit from Sants/Airport/La Rambla. Currently, line L4 of the subway is closed (until mid-August of \u201907) from Bogatell to La Pau. There are a couple of options to get around this. First, the Tram (route T4) runs from Ciutadella/Villa Olimpica (easier transfer to/from the L4) to Estaci\u00f3 de Sant Adri\u00e0. The El Maresme stop is 5 minutes from the hotel (just on the other side of the mall \u2013 there\u2019s a ticket machine on the platform \u2013 the tickets are interchangeable with the subway.) Your other option is to use the special bus service that runs between Bogatell to La Pau (there\u2019s a million signs for this \u2013 very easy to use even for English speakers). We found the tram to be a little faster, plus it has a very convenient connection with subway line L1 at Glories that will take you to Catalunya. General Area: As noted above and in other reviews, the hotel is in the suburbs and at the beach\u2026sort of. There\u2019s a beach 3-4 blocks away however it appears that most of the natives prefer the beaches a little closer to the city (try the L4 stop at Barceloneta and follow the crowd). The hotel also has a nice pool area with lots of lounge chairs. Directly across the street from the hotel is the very fancy Diagonal Mar mall. Alcampo is the Wal-Mart equivalent. The mall also has MANY eating options including some that stay open late. If you don\u2019t want to pay the high prices at the Hilton for food, Diagonal Mar is a great option. We felt very safe walking around the area near the hotel \u2013 even late at night. There were always people around. For extra safety, you can walk through the mall. Knocks: 2. Realistically, this hotel caters to the convention crowd. Don\u2019t stay here if you have an aversion to a bunch of people walking around with name tags. Secondly, the hotel won\u2019t win any awards for its proximity to the main sights (i.e. Ramblas, Picasso, Sagrada Familia). We actually considered the latter to be a slight plus. After a long day fighting tourist crowd, we enjoyed hopping off the tram in a residential area, smelling the sea breeze, and being able to leisurely walk back to our hotel. In summary, we loved the Hilton Barcelona Diagonal Mar. It\u2019s encompasses just about everything you expect from a Hilton. If you are looking for a hotel with a lot of local flavor, this probably isn\u2019t the hotel for you. However if you are looking for a typical high-end American style hotel, this place is absolutely perfect for you.", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cVery nice new hotel, clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "g8rvictor", "ReviewID": "UR7936539", "Content": "Stayed here for a night in June.
