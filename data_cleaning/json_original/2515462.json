Got an excellent rate of $80 through hotwire. My experience was just good. I was asked at chck-in if I wanted to upgrade to a larger suite for $50 a night since it was a slower week. I declined, but they missed an opportunity for a strong 1st impression since there was plenty of space available for free upgrades. The Suite: the bathroom was fantastic, the bedroom was very good, but my television had to be fixed 4 times by a technician!!! The other reviews that mention the loud train noise all day...it's real. The spa facility is excellent and surprisingly empty the three times I paid the $12 extra fee to use the steam/sauna (this is not included in the required $25 resort fee). The location is off the strip behind the Fashion Show Mall. You can walk through the mall or walk on a side street to Las Vegas Blvd. in the daytime. I asked the doorman/bellman if it was safe to walk on the side street at night since the mall (Nordstrom) closes at 9pm. He replied that it was sketchy and that it is best to take a cab or the Trump shuttle. Bummer! If I do hotwire again, I am hopeful that I don't get The Trump since I would not put it in the 5 star category.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winona, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPretty great place -\u201d", "Author": "cindirelly", "ReviewID": "UR127843257", "Content": "This was a very nice property overall - though I have to say it was missing a few things - like the phone in the living room didn't work and the lamp went on and off depending on whether you jiggled it. If you could get past little things like that, it was a very nice room. I read reports about the train whistle, and I do have to say that there were times I heard it faintly, and a couple times when it sounded like it was actually coming through the floor below me, even though I was on the 57th floor. So... light sleepers might not love this. I was on the \"city view\" side - a.k.a. ugly view of giant demolition zones and pretty hills in the distance, but I'm not sure being on the other side of the building would mask that train whistle. On the bright side, the bed was a dream to sleep on. I upgraded my room to a one-bedroom suite for just $35 a night more than what I paid for a three-night stay on Hotwire - which seemed like a great deal to me. But I had to ask for bathrobes to be brought up - which are definitely worth asking for. One thing I really didn't like was that it seemed really dark in the suite. One thing I really loved was the gigantic bathroom. Huge. But the \"plasma TV\" embedded in the mirror barely worked and had a terrible signal quality - another one of those misses in what could have been a truly luxury experience. It is just not that far to the strip, but I don't think I would walk it at night because it's dark, and on one side of the road you actually run out of sidewalk because of construction. The shuttle to Caesars Palace was handy, and cutting through the Fashion Mall during the day saved tons of walking. Even not cutting through the mall though, it really was less than five minutes to the bustle of the strip. My hat is off to the staff of this hotel, who I found to be, without exception, extremely polite and helpful. Whatever Trump Towers was missing, being treated so well by the staff certainly made up for it. They made it a very classy experience. The only people I didn't love by the end were the pool staff - I about died of thirst waiting for a drink - and I would have drank more if they ever came back. Service was incredibly slow even though the pool was practically abandoned. And as far as pools go, it was nothing fancy, but it was a comfortable place to soak up a little sun. I'd stay here again if I got a good deal on it - it's not the nicest place I've ever stayed, but it is awfully nice, though it would be better if the stuff in my room worked better.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cDON'T USE HOTWIRE - You'll end up at Trump Vegas\u201d", "Author": "John C", "ReviewID": "UR127842978", "Content": "Bid a 5 star hotel for vegas on Hotwire and you will get TRUMP which has NO CASINO, not sure how a square building with a square pool and only a couple small cheezy places to eat qualify's for 5 star... was my own fault for booking via bid process but of all the hotels in Vegas...

We will only stay at Trump in the future!\u201d", "Author": "1MidwestMama", "ReviewID": "UR127769182", "Content": "In planning a family trip to Vegas with two kids, I wanted a hotel that was accomodating for children where there wouldn't be gambling, smoking, half naked women, etc., and Trump was perfect for us! We stayed 4 nights during spring break (this month) and we hope to go back this summer. The location is great--a long block off the strip but not too far to walk to everything. Realistically, it is a long walk to go between the major hotels anyway so this was a non-issue. Because it is off the strip, there are no people loitering outside, no panhandlers or people handing out the graphic cards, no foot traffic to contend with when accessing the hotel and not much traffic. We discovered that walking through Fashion Show Mall was a fun shortcut to the strip and the entrance to Nordstrom is directly across from Trump's entrance with a marked pedestrian crossing in the street. There is a free shuttle that goes from Trump to Caesar's, and from Trump to Wynn which is down the long block and across the street - we used the shuttle several times and this was also great. The valet is great and included with the daily resort fee. They did get a little busy but we didn't mind waiting a few minutes for the car. The bell desk will store your luggage if you need to check out before you are ready to leave. You can print your boarding passes in the business center. All these little details make a difference! The hotel itself is very clean and the lobby is simple & beautiful! There isn't anything \"extra\" like an aquarium, rainforest, or circus; but it is functional. The elevators are just through the lobby so unlike at some hotels where you walk 15 minutes through a casino just to get to the elevator, at Trump, you can be in your room within minutes of walking through the front door. The rooms are set up in pairs with a door from the hallway into a small foyer with two doors leading to two different rooms. This would be great if traveling with another family (we weren't). I think there were people in the adjacent room but I never heard them (it is quiet). There is a doorbell in the hallway, and there are switches/lights for \"do not disturb\" and \"housekeeping\" which is so much nicer than the door tags. We had a \"city view\" room and the view is nice - mountains in the distance, buildings, and we could see the Stratosphere and Circus Circus. I see no need to pay more for the strip view! The room was just like in all the photos I had seen. It is large compared to any standard room and simple yet elegant like the lobby. The king bed was comfy though the sofabed was not quite as comfy. There is a TON of storage space. There are two wardrobe closets and there are upper cabinets big enough to put several large suitcases so they are out of your way, plus other storage. There are tons of kitchen cabinets and there were basic cooking pieces. You can request more dishes if needed and they are replaced daily. There is a 2 burner cooktop, large mini-fridge, microwave, blender, toaster and one cup coffee pot. I wish there had been a freezer but we managed. We bought groceries for breakfast and snacks which saved us money over eating out everyday. The bathroom was enjoyed by the whole family! Who would think it would make a difference but it really did. There is a small tv built into the mirror and my kids loved watching tv while soaking in the very large, deep jetted tub. Other times, they pulled chairs in there (yes there is plenty of room for several arm chairs) just to watch tv. We loved the large walk in shower and separate toilet room. There is lots of storage in the vanity cabinets which was nice too. We did not try the on site restaurant but the pool side drink service was nice. The pool was closed a few days because of high winds which was disappointing but for safety. The pool also has limited hours (8am to 7pm when we were there), but I'm not sure if the hours are the same all year or not. The pool itselt was awesome for our kids with a maximum depth of 4 ft (I think). There were lots of kids in the pool with the adults sunning on the super comfy chairs. There is plenty of seating and some nice extra large reserved chairs next to the pool. There are lifeguards despite the \"no lifeguards on duty\" sign, and there are at least 2 whirlpool spas. Check in/out was easy and quick and there were no surprise charges. This was one of the few hotels I've ever stayed in where I felt at home and truly comfortable. We did not want to leave and considered staying extra days. We will go back and I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else, even if the kids were not with us!", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "McAllister, MT", "Title": "\u201cPure Luxury\u201d", "Author": "mtbarbster", "ReviewID": "UR127763865", "Content": "We just stayed 3 nights at The Trump in Las Vegas and it was wonderful.

A crib (nice quality) was provided free of charge for the duration of our stay. The suite had two bathrooms (two showers), Three TV's (living room, bedroom, bathroom), 270 degree views of Las Vegas and the strip with floor-to-ceiling windows. As some reviewers have mentioned, the bed was somewhat squeaky-- it was comfortable though, not lumpy at all. Bedding was high quality and very clean. There is a set of train tracks SW of the property. I heard the train on occasion, never while we were trying to sleep. The sound is minimal from the 46th floor. We actually found that the helicopters flying by made more noise (helicopter flight path is immediately west of the hotel). Check-in and check-out were efficient, as was room service and concierge. The pool is wonderfully warm, drink service poolside is awesome! This hotel is no more than five minutes walk from the strip (2 blocks). Those who complained about the distance to the strip must be lazy. We walked over to Wynn multiple times, walked to and from Mirage, Bellagio, Paris, you name it. Perhaps we had no issue because we enjoy wandering and checking out the sights. There is a free shuttle to Caesar's Palace or Wynn every 15-20 minutes. Fashion show mall across the street is worth checking out.

It's been almost a month and they have not given us an answer (mind you, we have been the ones who have had to call, call, call to get any sort of \"update\") as to whether they are going to do anything to fix our car.

The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The bathroom had a whirlpool tub - very nice indeed. The housekeeping department does a nice job of keeping the rooms clean. They are, in fact, cleaner than a lot of other high-end resorts on the strip. Our biggest complaint was the bed. It was not very comfortable at all. My side was a little lopsided and the hubs found it to be lumpy or something...he couldn't quite find the right way to describe it. All in all, they need new mattresses, stat.

Like most hotels, it has pros and cons, many of which have been mentioned here in other reviews. Cons: It is NOT on the strip, but about a 7 minute walk from Las Vegas Boulevard or about the same through the Fashion Show Mall, when it's open. Yes, there is a shuttle to the Wynn or Caesars, but I never had any luck catching it on the way back to the hotel. The resort fee. Its supposed to include wifi, but I never got any connection worth using in my suite on the 28th floor. It works very fast if you go down to the lobby to use. Otherwise, sending smoke signals could have been faster. I mentioned this to the concierge, and she tried blaming it on the gold in the color of the building. I told her that if it doesn't work, they shouldn't be charging for it.\u00a0 Train noise in the very early mornings even though we were on the 28th floor facing the strip. Woke me up every time it went by blowing its whistle. It took 3 requests to get the fan in the bathroom working. 1 through housekeeping, 1 through front desk and finally, through the concierge, who I assume, got it fixed. It's not really the hotels fault, but the pool was closed several times due to high winds. It was blowing patio furniture into the pool. Again, this is due in part to the hotels location. Pros: Non-smoking and no casino to walk through to get to your room.\u00a0 Suite was well equipped with kitchenette, microwave, utensils, toaster, blender, etc. Lots of storage. Summary: A nice hotel but with the \"resort\" fee and the distance from Las Vegas Boulevard, I think there are many other nicer places to stay. For what it's worth, there were a LOT of kids staying here, I'm not sure if it's because of the pull out couch giving you extra room or the kitchenette allowing you to cook some meals in the suite to save money.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "CJPNorfolkEngland", "ReviewID": "UR127187839", "Content": "We stayed here for five nights and could not fault it.

Same floor and couple rooms down and the best part of it was he was able to get me a strip view for the inconvenience.

This is an inexpensive 5-star hotel, which makes it a great choice. We stayed here for one full week. Here are some perks of this hotel: -Ample storage space (cupboards; drawers) for all your belongings. -Large suites, and roomy bathroom with two sinks Jacuzzi. -Kitchenette, including bar fridge and coffee maker, came in handy \u2013 particularly for breakfasts. -Great exercise room with a good variety of exercise options. There are both weight machines and free weights, and a variety of cardio machines. And the water coolers with fresh orange slices in the water was a nice touch. -We never did make it to the pool, but the outdoor pool is heated which is a nice perk for winter trips. -Free shuttle rides to Caesars came in handy. Some pitfalls of this hotel: -Train noise. Unfortunately this was a major pitfall. I had read about this in the reviews, and even requested a room sheltered from the noise at check-in, but we could still hear it in the middle of the night. So do bring earplugs. We got a room change because of this, and we could still hear it. We could hear the train on the north side; we could hear the train on the south side. I believe some reviews said try to get the east side, which makes sense as this is the furthest away from the train tracks. I did ask for the east side but did not get it. The train noise issue is unfortunately a major pitfall, and would deter me from booking with this hotel again. -Slamming door noise. This hotel seems to have door issues. Each door in the hallway is an entrance to two different suites. So when you open the door, you see two more doors \u2013 one is your suite and the other is someone else\u2019s suite. If you\u2019re lucky, no one is staying in the suite next to you. One evening when we went to bed early all I could hear was our neighbour\u2019s doors slamming shut in sets of two \u2013 once into the main entrance, and then once again into their suite. And it was loud enough that I thought someone was coming into our room. Also, the glass doors in the washroom (one for the toilet, and one for the shower) naturally slam shut if you don\u2019t ease it when closing \u2013 it creates quite the \u201cclang.\u201d I could even hear it in the suite above us. I guess Trump didn\u2019t get the best door engineers/designers. For those of you wondering what services come with the resort fee, here\u2019s the list: -High speed internet -Courtesy shuttle to and from Caesars and Wynn -$25 credit to the SPA at the Trump (conditions apply) -Access to the fitness center -In-room coffee replenished daily -Bottled water replenished daily -Daily newspaper -Shoe shine service -Printing of incoming faxes and boarding passes -Unlimited local and toll free calls", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCalm, beautiful but something went bump in the night!\u201d", "Author": "AngelBears", "ReviewID": "UR127033010", "Content": "We stayed four nights at the end of March in Trump Las Vegas at the back of the hotel (facing away from strip) in a suit on the 34th floor.

Absolutely surreal at night! Now for the bad. First of all train tracks are next to the hotel and the freight train passes 3-5 times at all hours of the day and night. The train has to blow the horn because it crosses a street intersection next to the hotel....and man is it loud! Mid-morning, late afternnon and anywhere between 3am & 6am. I had to wear earplugs at night but I still heard it and felt the rumbling....and we were on the 58th floor!! As for the pool, nothing worth mentioning. While at the pool, great view of the Encore and Wynn hotels (idea for a future trip). Also, when it gets windy, not a good place to be because unlike casino hotels, you are not surrounded by buildings. It's pretty wide open. We wanted to smnoke cigars and a plaza is available for this. But the plaza is absolutely uninspiring. Found many tiles on the top of the retaining wall have come loose of which I advised the front desk. The overall feel of the outside ammenities is that of a strictly corporate hotel. As for the bar and restaurant, I would not be fair to rate it as I did not use either. Not because they are no good. Simply put...they were uninviting. Very drab, dull and quiet. The good - Great staff, clean, modern and spacious room. Great view of the strip, comfortabloe beds. The bad - Train crossing, pool, bar, restaurant and plaza quite a bit on the dull side.

Amazing\u201d", "Author": "TravelRobertG", "ReviewID": "UR126582200", "Content": "My wife and I traveled with another couple for a seminar. I pricelined 5 stars and bid around $120 and was surprised when I got the Trump International. I was a little concerned at first. I have been to Vegas once before in 2005 and never heard of the Trump. I read the Tripadvisor reviews and learned that the hotel is not directly on the strip and has no casino. I was impressed with the reviews an excited to see what the Donald had to offer. On to the review. ROOM- In a word- amazing. Taking a cue from the Trip Advisor comments we asked for an upgrade for a strip facing room. The cost was laughably low to get in a suite. The room we are is both expansive and luxurious. The bathroom is huge with a two person jacuzzi tub. Everything is top notch from the sub zero fridge in our full kitchen to the wonderful mattress. My wife has exacting standards for a mattress and is usually disappointed. She is in love with this bed. Food- Some of the best I've ever had, and easily the most reasonbly priced room service. You spend the same amount for dinner on the Strip, or have it brought to your room. Service- First class. I was impressed with the prompt attention and hospitality of the staff. My wife and I have stayed at 4 star resorts around this country and the Trump staff and crew ranks up there with the best. Train Noise- I heard the train twice in 4 days and I was listening for it. The tripadvisor reviews recommend a higher floor to minimize the noise. My wife and I never heard the train over our Ipad sound machine app. No Casino- No casino means no smoke filled lobby full of the droning rattle and chimes of slot machines. It makes the Trump feel like an oasis after the crowds, noise, and smoke on the Strip. The Wynn is a short walk away, or you can take the free shuttle to Wynn or Caesars. Not being \"on the strip\"- My wife and I love to walk. Staying at the trump adds less than 1/2 a mile to your destination. The walk is great, not a lot of traffic. You can go through the mall if it's hot, or head straight to the Wynn. This short distance is worth it, as it keeps the Strip mob of people away from the hotel. Cons- Ok. A good review has to have something critical. Here goes. The wifi is really slow on the higher floors, and often would not work at all in our room. The TV had problems with the images, but most channels worked fine. The gym equipment is second rate. There is a resort fee of $20. The resort fee have become the norm in the last decade. I still feel like it's an underhanded way of generating revenue. If these fees aren't optional, just include them in the price. Value- We paid around $165 a night total (priceline plus upgrade plus resort fee). I've never paid so little for so much luxury, space, comfort, and service. Overall- This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed (Ritz-Dallas being the other). If you aren't a slot addict or smoker, this is the place for you. My wife and I have already decided that as long we are staying only at the Trump when we go to Vegas.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. John's, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "sherryanderic", "ReviewID": "UR126555043", "Content": "Room was clean, spacious and gorgeous.

The valet and bellman staff were excellent. I was greeted by the front desk staff and escorted to a desk immediately upon entering the hotel. I barely said more then my name and the man at the front desk seemed to be instantly knowledgeable about my many room requests and assured me they had been taken care of without me even asking yet. The hotel and the room looked very clean and well kept. These are the reasons my rating is 2 stars instead of 1. The reason I had so many room requests at booking my stay is because myself and my two children are extremely allergic to feathers. My kids get asthma, I however get pneumonia if I breathe them in. I explained this at booking and was assured my room would be clean and removed of any feather products before I got there. This is key, because I can go into a room that has had feathers but I cannot go in one that currently has feathers. Anyone that has squished a feather pillow or comforter knows why, they send hundreds of minute feather pieces into the air. Anyways we get to our room and my husband checks for feathers. He finds a feather comforter and two pillows in the cabinets. He finds one feather pillow on the bed. We call and housekeeping comes up to switch that all out. What we missed and what housekeeping definitely should not have missed now twice is a feather comforter tucked between sheets on the bed. I slept in that bed and was extremely sick in the morning. My husband called the front desk and they were not very accommodating. They gave us the choice of cleaning the room and removing the feathers or putting all of our things in storage and giving us a new room once they dealt with the line of people waiting in the lobby for a room. I was shocked. We didn't have the option of waiting because we had to go to a wedding. In the amount of time they sent that cleaning crew in to clean our room they could have cleaned another one and moved us into it, but they didn't and wouldn't. They didn't offer us any compensation for that one night where they did everything wrong for us. Very disappointing for a hotel that advertises on its high service. If they had cleaned our room right and removed the feathers as promised several times and did not assure us that they were removed and let me enter that room with them in it, I would have given this hotel 5 stars. By the way, upon packing 4 days later we found someones broken belt and some new shirt packaging in the back of a shelf in the clothes cabinet. This is how well they clean this hotel. Since they didn't try to do a thing to make this right for us, I can't see us every staying at a Trump again.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVery impressed!!!!\u201d", "Author": "PNieves72", "ReviewID": "UR126463141", "Content": "The staff are very helpful and each staff member take pride in what they do.

There is no casino but we found this to be a great advantage because you do not get the herds of people wandering through the hotel to use the casino, drunken yahoos and cigarette smoke - there are no \"attractions\" which again is great because after walking the strip all day this is a real haven of calm and class.the Lobby is beautiful and well maintained - they were shampooing the carpets and took the chandeliers down in the middle of the night to clean them.

Excited to be in Vegas for the first time, but exhausted from our flight, the staff member who checked us was informative and fast. We also got upgraded to a corner suite which had a view that was to die for. It probably ended up really making our trip. The hostess there even suggested an awesome pizza joint that delivered to the hotel 27/7 so we could have some dinner. Our bags were quickly taken up to our room and met the concierge met us there. He showed us around and made sure we were comfortable before bidding us a good night. These little touches made it so much fun.

Beware: if a cab driver sounds interested in whether you are off the London flight, he's likely not showing interest in anything but your gullibility! We chose the hotel because of its affiliation with the Preferred Hotels marketing group. The supposed upgrade afforded was to a Strip view room, but it was too low to see the Strip. (Given this was on the 36th floor, I would guess only the very top floors really have the view.) The greeting was warm and professional, and the room was well decorated (in more muted style than we expected). It had a large bathroom with whirlpool bath, separate walk-in shower, WC, and two wash basins. Everything was spotlessly clean. The kitchenette was adequately provisioned with place settings and cutlery for two, and had a cooker, microwave, and fridge. Unfortunately on the single day of our trip that we had time to use the pool deck a cold wind was blowing - so we only took a look at what was available - but it all looked very nice. The exercise room, though small, contained an adequate selection of equipment / CV machines. As others have mentioned, the hotel is off Strip but we found the Forum Shops and Wynn shuttles very useful. The Wynn is actually pretty close so we often walked, but on one occasion the friendly driver stopped and picked us up en-route. Both shuttles run frequently throughout the day and the longest wait was 10 minutes or so. I can see that the over-enthusiastic use of the train whistle would upset some, but although I am a light sleeper I was aware of it but not actually woken fully. The biggest disappointment was DJT restaurant. I would think that Mr Trump would be disappointed too if he ate here - especially with his initials attached! The service was adequate, although it tried a little too hard (to the point of obsequiousness) but the food was over-salted in the extreme and otherwise of not too good quality. (I thought a previous reviewer was exaggerating, but I swear it screwed-up my mouth and sense of taste for days.) There was a weird (in my opinion) gap between the approx $30 prix fixe menu and entr\u00e9es of $40 and up. If I were running this place, I'd either sack the chef or seriously reeducate his palate (most likely the former as it was so WRONG)! A different chef did the breakfast and we found it to be of better quality and reasonably value with charmingly natural waiting staff. We were in Las Vegas for a short trip and - whilst it would have been convenient for us to dine at the hotel on more than the single occasion that we tried - we were afraid we'd get more over-priced and over-seasoned rubbish and so made the effort to go out. We're glad we did. In summary: stay for the comfort, eat breakfast, but avoid dinner at all costs (and I suspect this goes for room service also).", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shorewood, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, fabulous hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Stormins", "ReviewID": "UR126149634", "Content": "I booked a group reservation through Hotwire and ended up getting this hotel.

We had a view of the strip and the mountains which was very nice, especially at night. The rooms are huge with a kitchenette built in, but don't bet on cooking in it (no grocery stores near by). The room was immaculate, with all of the amenities which we required. The only thing that we would have liked was some hotel information in the room (there is some available on the TV, but we found this limited). The bathroom is amazing, almost the same size as the room, with a jacuzzi tub that you could almost swim in! The shower and toilet are in their own glass cubicles, which we would imagine would be very useful for a family sharing the room. Another nice touch is the inner and outer bedroom doors, which eliminate noise from the corridor, you just share with the room next to you. Room service was very efficient and the prices were not stupid. We paid $16 for a pizza which was delicious and less than the cost of a delivered pizza. We purchased wine from Walgreens which is on the strip and housekeeping brought us a corkscrew within 5 minutes of our request. When collecting the car from the valet, it might help to call down as the wait is around 5 minutes for the car. The attendant always asked if we needed directions and appeared knowledgeable. A little tip - you can make a shortcut through Nordstrom and the Fashion Show Mall to get to the strip without walking along the main road.

Check-In went very smoothly, I checked in very early, but a room was available. I was able to upgrade to a corner suite for a very reasonable up charge per night. The Corner Suite was HUGE, big living room, large kitchenette with full size fridge and range. Dining room table for 4, barstools at the bar, and a sectional couch with a large flat screen. Bedroom was as big, with two large closets, and the bathroom was bigger than most hotel rooms on the strip. Full tub, separate huge free-standing glass shower, private commode with door, double sinks, it was outstanding. Amenities Only one bar and restaurant in the hotel. Bar service was great, but pricey. Didn't try the restaurant other than coffee and a croissant in the morning, which was great, but more pricey! Trump didn't get rich by undercharging folks, that's for sure! Ambiance This is a very classy establishment, it feels much like Bellagio did when it opened, on 1/100th of the scale. Bell and Concierge service staff was great. Downsides Spendy Extras: Not cheap, room was actually quite reasonable, everything else from the $3 cokes in the giftshop to the $14 bourbon's at the bar was pricey. Cell Service: Not sure if I blame the hotel for this or not, but it's a factor to keep in mind. Your Cell Phone (we're both on AT&T so keep that in mind) WILL NOT WORK inside the hotel. I think it's the cool looking gold film on the windows, but whatever it is, don't expect to use your cell phone inside the room. HUGE inconvenience.

Our room was standard, booked through priceline at an EXCELLENT rate. We were quite happy with the decor, amenities, and cleanliness of our room. The sub zero fridge, wolf range, and bosch microwave were pleasant surprises. Our view was looking north unfortunately, so not of the strip. But it was excellent none the less. The service staff we interacted with were extremely friendly and helpful. Doormen were always there to get the door for us, the bell desk was super friendly when we checked our bags on our last day.

I have been to Vegas many times, and it is refreshing not to come back to a smoke filled lobby and hotel corridors. Room: room was nice with more than enough room. The drawer was missing a handle (#5101) but not a big deal. (In case you are reading this Trump Hotel, we did not break it !) Bottled water was nice everyday as we did not have to go down to Walgreens at the Venetian or at the mall and haul it back. Coffee was nice too everyday. On occasion, we got more than 2 waters and coffee packets. Its nice to be able to drink an item in your hotel and not worry about weight sensors that automatically bill your room that exist in other hotels (ex: Caesar's) The jet-tub in bathroom is huge and although I usually just shower, I had to try out the tub that very easily fits two. Shuttle service was offered to the Wynn and Caesar's and wait time was minimal. The only suggestion I might make here is to eliminate the Wynn shuttle and replace it with one that takes you down to the other end of the strip (MGM, Aria, etc) We did not try the restaurant but prices looked reasonable for Las Vegas. The outdoor pool is heated but I didnt know this prior to booking or I would have brought my bathing suit. I was not bothered by the ~$20 resort fee daily as I was made aware of this upon checkin and reading prevous reviews.

The experience was superb, and I will stay here again as soon as I have the opportunity. The staff I encountered, to a person, were pleasant, professional and personable. They all went out of their way to make sure my needs were addressed and my expectations exceeded. I ordered room service a few times during my stay, and it arrived promptly every time, ahead of the time they estimated, and the orders were always correct. Housekeeping for my room was convenient and very thorough throughout my stay. The rooms are very spacious and well equipped, the bathroom is palatial including a deep jacuzzi that you simply must try out. The bed was extremely comfortable. The sweeping view from my room, 4908, was breathtaking. Ask for a Strip view room on an upper floor. My room was very quiet overall. I did not hear the train once. While the hotel has no casino, only two restaurants, and yes it is located a ten minute walk from the strip, the location is still very convenient and serene. I prefer not to have to contend with swarms of boisterous partiers to navigate around in the lobby and avoid in the hallways outside my door when I want to relax and get some rest before another full day of activities in Vegas. You can walk from the hotel to the Strip in 10 minutes, either through the adjacent and upscale Fashion Show Mall or around the outside corner of the mall, OR simply take the complimentary shuttle from the Trump to the Wynn or Caesar's Forum Shops that runs every 10 to 15 minutes each way. Now, before you decide this is too far and mark the hotel off your list of properties to consider booking in Vegas, just keep in mind that you will walk longer than 10 minutes through any of the hotels on the Strip to get from the guest rooms through their casinos to the front of the hotels. It is easy to underestimate walking time/distances in the large Vegas properties, but having walked through the Bellagio, the Palazzo, the Venetian, and Caesar's, I can assure you the walk from the Trump to the strip is brief to equivalent in comparison. I for one really enjoyed have the room elevators only steps away from the hotel lobby, when I returned to the Trump after a long enjoyable day in Vegas. As for not having a casino - bravo! Casinos = crowds = smoke = noise. It is wonderful to not have to inhale or reek of smoke from a walk through the lobby of the Bellagio or Venetian, for example, to reach their shopping areas or to the Strip. The hotel itself is so clean it sparkles, and the fresh scent piped through the ventilation system that greets you every time you enter the lobby is very welcoming and a unique feature. Just walk into any other Vegas strip hotel, and see how you would describe the first scent you enounter. Smoke? Stale air from hordes of tourists? Take your pick. In any case, trust me: you will appreciate this feature of the hotel more than you think. There are so many restaurants in Vegas, you are not going to want to eat in your hotel every night. Many dining options are located close to the Trump, in Fashion Show Mall, in the nearby Wynn, Encore, TI, Palazzo, Venetian...you will want to explore your options and it is nice to have DJT as an option for times you don't want to dine outside the Trump. I really can't say enough good things about this hotel.

To me the staff being excellent was not a huge selling point because I honestly think the staff at the other hotels are just as awesome. The reason why I gave this place an average rating only is mainly because of Location, location, location! 1) I hate having to plan my times around the shuttle bus and waiting and wasting time. To me time is money. There are no cabs just waiting around here either so it's kind of hard to get around having to wait for a cab or shuttle bus. 2) It is far away from the shows and restaurants so it was again annoying being far away. 3) There are no side walks connecting all the way to the strip either. You have to kind of take your chances walking on the road on a few occasions (I haven't been back since early 2011 so I don't know if this has been fixed. The pool was very tame and usual. Nothing really special about it. What I would recommend is that a monorail be built to the strip casinos to improve the situation. When I goto Vegas I basically have the choice of a zillion 5 star hotels.

I will stay here again without hesitation. The Great: The staff was amazingly professional and friendly. Everyone introduced themselves by name and asked if I needed anything. When a request was made, they made a sincere effort to satisfy that request. I never once got the sense that the staff was anything but pleased to be of assistance. Our City View Room was huge with its comfortable king sized bed, large sitting area, massive bathroom (this was a handicap access room and those typically are more roomy). The Good: The facility is nonsmoking so there is no running the smoke filled gauntlet wherever you go. Because there is no casino at this location, there is no effort to trap you in its confines. As a result, from the time you walk into the front door to the time you are sitting in your room tops out at 5 minutes (if you walk slowly). The room has a nice kitchenette including a cooktop with 2 burners, a microwave, the cursed fridge (see later), and a one cup at a time coffee maker. There were dishes and silverware for 2 available. Useable pots/pans in the drawers, there was even a salad spinner for use. Preparing a Gourmet meal might be a challenge (no Souffles), but most meals are do-able. There was LOTS of storage and 2 closets with low hangers; I never figured out how a long dress would have been hung - fortunately I did not bring one. Downstairs, the DJT Restaurant has, in addition to a la cart dining, a $29 fixed price menu that provides salad, main course, and desert. The Scallops in lobster bisque was amazing. I also recommend the Caprese Salad. There is a shuttle that runs from the Trump to the Wynn then back to the Trump and off to Caesar's Palace. I heard it was 20 minutes round trip but never waited even 5 minutes for it so I guess I was lucky. You can walk to the strip by taking a left from the front of the hotel and walking about 15 minutes to the Wynn. It is also possible to reach the strip by cutting through the Fashion Mall which is across the street from the Trump entrance. The shuttle doesn't run 24 hours a day so, for convenience or necessity, taxis to/from the strip seemed to cost $7-8 with tip although a trip to the Cosmopolitan cost $15. From the airport it was $18 with tip, but this could vary with traffic. Check out was a snap on the large TV in the room. Needs Work: While everything looked wonderful and everyone was wonderful, our room had a few issues: the safe was broken, one of the lights was burned out, there were no coffee supplies in the kitchenette, there was dust in the radio's iPhone jack. The staff never could get the fridge set to the correct temperature - regardless of the setting, the fridge either froze everything or didn't cool at all. In most hotels I would have chalked this up to neglect but my impression of the Trump is they are obsessive in their attention to detail so I was surprised that they overlooked so many things in this one room. The H2(Eau) is a pool side cafe that needs work. They tell you up front that your meal may take 30 minutes to arrive. If you are over 10, don't order the Hot Chocolate. The Shuttle stop at Caesar's is not at the valet drop off. I was told it was at the Planet Hollywood sign but never found where. This is a potential safety issue since the Planet Hollywood sign area was not well populated at midnight. In summary, The Trump Las Vegas is a nonsmoking hotel with wonderful service and a shuttle to the strip. If you need a casino in the Lobby, this isn\u2019t the place; but if you want something close to but not within the maddening crowd, this is it.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix", "Title": "\u201cStill love this non-gaming hotel near the Las Vegas Strip, but...\u201d", "Author": "PhoenixWestin", "ReviewID": "UR125161665", "Content": "...this favorite hotel is starting to show it's wear.

The lobby is great - exactly what you'd expect from Donald Trump - gold, sparkly and over the top! There were a few tiny niggles, for example no big white fluffy towels or robes in the room. The towels were a bit Premier Inn-esque! And they're a bit stingy with the tea/coffee facilities in the room. The food from room service wasn't great either. Other than that - it was great. One thing i'd mention though is that some of the hotel booking websites in the UK haven't got the room descriptions right. We booked through hotels.com and their description of the Deluxe City Suite described a proper suite with separate living room, two bathrooms etc. When we checked in though, we had a regular junior suite (one big room).

My only complaint is that the Trump is in a rather poor location, there is a nice shopping mall adjacent to it but there is nothing on the other side.

From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were treated like 5 star guests. From check in, to concierge, to valet parking to housekeeping, nobody could do too much for you. We found the complimentory shuttle a great help, dropping us at the Wynn or Caesars whenever we wanted, always with a smile. As we were there for 2 weeks, we had the odd day where we would lie in, and go out later in the day. Never once did housekeeping moan, just kept saying \"let us know when you want your room cleaning\". One night it was 10pm, we came home to fing our room un-made? A quick call and it was sorted. The beds and linnen are fantastic, the spa-bath incredible and even the tv in the bathroom mirror a great touch. As for the resort fee. Well, as we are non smokers and seldom gamblers, we had no problem paying the 20 odd dollars fee per night.

Although this hotel isn't the huge sprawling themed casino hotels that you'll find embedded along the Strip in Vegas, for a business trip with little time for the chaos that the strip can be, it was perfect. I appreciated not having to hoof it a half a mile to get to the elevator to go to my room, as the other large name brands force you to do. I don't find the noise of the casinos to be music to my ears after long hours at a trade show or at the Market. Without having to trek through casinos and endless shops, it was very convenient and easy to get to our rooms. At night, there is staff checking for room keys so that uninvited non-guests can't venture beyond the lobby area. Greatly appreciated by us. The Trump Hotel is upscale, has service down to perfection (as you would expect) and had very comfortable, appealing rooms. The lobby was ornate, but tasteful. Gold pillars and crystal chandeliers as you would expect from Trump. The staff, attentive, polite, and accommodating. Many reviewers made comments about the noisy side of the hotel and the quiet side. Our room was on the city side, which is considered to be the noisy side. We did not, however, experience any of the disruption from the trains that some of the other rooms suggested. We appreciated the subzero refrigerator in the kitchen area of the room, but did not use any of the other kitchen appliance options. The bathroom was wonderfully large adorned in marble with a very large 2 person walk in shower. The mirror had a television embedded in the screen which was enjoyed daily. Maid service was good. When I went into my room at one point when the maid was cleaning it, she was very apologetic and offered to leave the room while I was in it and come back. This wasn't necessary as I was only there to pick something up, but the gesture was appreciated. The beds were very comfortable and slept well every night. I would definitely consider staying here again on my next trip back on business. As stated, this is not your typical noisy, huge, sprawling Vegas hotel. It is more of a boutique style, smaller, but not lacking in style or service. (Unlike the larger strip hotels where service can be a challenge sometimes) If you are looking for a buffet, you won't find that at the Trump either. The Trump does offer free shuttle service to the very close WYNN Hotel, so if you are craving the true Vegas strip atmosphere, it's only moments away. If you are traveling to Vegas with kids and don't want them exposed to some of the typical strip activities, this is the hotel for you. Also note, the staff did transport me to the airport when I was ready to go, so I don't know what other comments about no shuttle is about. I could always find transportation when needed. (And no, I'm not a young sexy thing. I'm mid 50's with that middle aged spread that most of us acquire! ) Maybe it was just timing on my part, but the when they took my suitcases and loaded them into the back of the hotel suburban, it seemed that this was quite the norm. Also transported my associate in the same manner today.

Constantly one of the staff was making sure that the visitors needs were being met-even before you asked. I had meant to ask for a late check out and forgot, but before I was done checking in, I was offered a late check out. It is much quieter than most of Las Vegas hotels so be prepared for that.You are apart from the hustle and bustle of the Strip but not too far, by taxi or a little hike. If shopping is your thing-the Fashion Mall is right across the street . If the gambling bug bites you, the shuttle will take you quickly to the neighboring Wynn. Because we came in late we did not dine at the restaurant so I can not comment on that, but the bar was busy in the spaceous lobby. The resort fee is the current way for the hotels to recoup some funds, and I didn't feel it was fair since we didn't use the pool (limited hours this time of season), the Wi-Fi (free at McDonalds?) and the water and coffee (even cheap end hotels give you water and coffee now). More customers need to complain about this fee! Trump Hotel is not alone in this matter..The room was huge and we were upgraded to a room with a view of the Strip from the 55th Fl! The bathroom was 1st class all the way and so was the kitchen area with refrig., stove top, and micro, etc... The seating area was very well done and the artwork in many areas of the suite was a classy touch.

When I need to leave the hotel to go to meetings, I was able to easily and quickly get a taxi \u2013 which is very difficult at other hotels during big conventions (average wait times can run 20 to 30 minutes). Upon check-in I was given a handicap accessible room in which everything was lower to the ground \u2013 nice for those who need it- but not for someone over 6 ft. I called the front desk and asked if they could give me a regular room \u2013 they immediately sent a bellman with a key to a new room- and upgraded me from a standard room to a one bedroom suite. I didn\u2019t have to argue or complain \u2013 they realized the error and without any discussion upgraded me \u2013 that is the way top notch establishments are supposed to operate. The furnishings and finishes in the room are top notch (both in the standard room and in the suite) \u2013 comfortable, stylish and appropriate furniture - marble floors and tile in the bathroom and shower- granite countertops and stainless appliances in the mini \u2013kitchen - high quality towels and bedding. Bottled water is free as is WiFi service. Best of all, this was THE CLEANIST hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed at in Las Vegas (and I\u2019ve been in most the major high end hotels in that city). Actually \u2013 this might have been the cleanest hotel room I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 yes, it was that clean.

The rooms are a great size, great little touch with reception ringing to check if everything is ok after 10 minutes, these rooms have a little kitchen and fridge so we were able to go out to stock up on beer. There is plenty of wardrobe space a little sitting area with a table and the bathroom has a Bathtub big enough for two!! I knew we were going to have to pay a resort fee and this was made clear to me when I booked. I was also advised at check in what this resort fee included Water, coffee, Daily paper, Wi-Fi, shuttle services to Wynn and Caesars all of which I either used or received. (I didn\u2019t use the Spa but my mum booked a massage which she said was excellent and my Dad used the fitness centre and the machines were all in working order) The Pool was open and people were swimming??

We have stayed at everything from the Gold Nugget to the Encore and lots in-between to use for reference in the review. The location is ok, at the upper end of the strip, but close enough to walk to the Encore/Wynn and the Fashion Mall is right across the street. Trump shuttle runs to the Wynn and Caesars approx. every 15 minutes if you want to get closer to a lot of the action. It took us maybe 10 minutes to walk to Wynn. There is no self parking, you have to valet. It's not too bad to tip and let them do the work anyway. Bellhops were very courteous and attentive. Check-in was a breeze. We asked about not staying within earshot of the train noise, as other reviewers have expressed some problems with it. We upgraded our studio to a one-bedroom suite, as we had a business meeting right in the room. The clerk assured us a room that was away from the noise. The good: 1. Nice kitchen, has a coffee maker. A luxury in Vegas. Most 5-star hotels and others either make you go to the lobby to buy a $6 cup. Would prefer a larger size maker though, it is only a single cup maker, but still better than nothing! 2. Size. Suite was large and spacious. Room for lots of your clothes, food, etc. 3. Bathroom. Huge bathroom, marble, double shower, jacuzzi tub, huge mirrors. I think the bathroom is nicer than Encore/Wynn. 4. Bed. Nice and soft. 5. Service. Exceptional service from all the personnel. Very impressed. Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful. BEST SERVICE SO FAR IN VEGAS. That says a lot. 6. Pool was open in January and its heated to 85F. A lot of other hotels close down the pool in the winter. 7. Fastest elevator in Vegas. Made our ears pop, that's fast. 8. Value. For the price, it is a good value. The bad: Since this is a 5-star, I am going to be a little more critical than a normal 3-4 star hotel. 1. The carpet had a stain in the room. Notable, because it was just staring at you when you walked in. 2. Hard water stain on fixtures. Lime-away needed to remove hard water stains on faucet and showerheads. 3. Drink stain on table in living area. A really bad water stain on the table, looked like it peeled the polyurethane right off the table. 4. Doors are heavy and closed heavy. Pretty loud. 5. Train noise. Heard the train, but only a couple times, didn't really rouse us from sleeping, but I would hate to be on the side with the train... 6. Television in living room did not work. The tv was on, but you could not turn it off nor switch any channels, not matter which buttons you pushed, you couldn't even unplug it! It just had a \"input\" floating around a blue screen all week. Finally said the heck with it. I did use the treadmill in the exercise/weight room. It was busy, seemed to have a variety of machines. I usually run outdoors, so rooms like this make me queasy anyways. The treadmill froze my ipod. I had to wait until the battery to die to restore it. All is well now. Used the business center to do a little business. Internet seemed a little slow, but they had iMacs, yay! Overall, this is a nice hotel with great service to stay at a reasonable price for a 5-star.

They have a free shuttle to the Forum shop often but during peak hours, wait can be long. Nordstroms is right across the street but there is no cross walk (at least not yet when I was there) so you have to jaywalk like everyone who wishes to go to the mall did which can be dangerous depending on traffic conditions.

This is also one of the few hotels that don't have a casino on the floor, which can be good or bad, depending on your needs. There is a train that is on one of the sides of the hotel, but we asked for a room farthest away from the train and the check-in person was happy to help us with that. Needless to say we didn't hear any train from our room. The rooms are nice and clean. There's a jet-tub in the bathroom and it was an experience! We went to the Wynn hotel later and even that didn't have these tubs! The only thing I didn't like about this hotel is that it's pretty far off from the strip if you decide to walk that is. It's about a 5 minutes walk across to the mall and 10 minutes walk to the strip. Although that sounds short, if you're going to walk on the strip, you will get tired fast. Bring walking shoes!

No casino, so more relaxed than the big strip hotels, It was nice to not have the constant pressure to tip everyone for everything, \u00a0that goes with these hotels. The let downs - Given an ease of access room without needing it or being advised. Shower much too low for me to use. Wardrobe too short to hang trousers etc. This was not a great issue but I was never asked if this ok and my request to relocate was not managed well, so I didn't bother in the end. \u00a0Great room for Warwick Davies to use if he is ever in town. Hotel could not cope with breakfast queues, people hanging around lobby waiting for tables all very disorganised and a long wait. When seated food and service was good. The hotel is noisy, not from\u00a0within, but outside street and train (yes you can hear trains in the night - I also heard other people discussing this at breakfast) noises seem loud. It's as though the windows are not sound proof. I asked for at check in, and was assured my room was a quite one, so I can only presume the whole hotel suffers from this noise penetration.\u00a0 The whole reception area has the smell of cheap air fresheners. I presume some kind of automatic aromatic system is used. I don't think it is needed, it smells like they are covering a bad smell. All in all not a bad hotel, \u00a0just not in the league it try's to position itself in. For my stay, it did not justify the rate paid. $200 per night less and I would not be so critical.

Overall, the room was lovely and made me reluctant to go out.. Service wise... I imagine hotel like Trump must not disappoint. However, there were few unfavourable things that happened. When I first arrived with luggage, I noticed that there were not any bellman to be seen, in fact, no one to open the door for the guests (which in four stars hotels, there usually are). While the check-in process went smoothly, They did check me into a dirty room first time. Furthermore, the staffs did not appear to be very friendly, but again it could be the las vegas hospitality.. The hotel is located at the end of the strip and to walk to the centre is probably taking 10 minute. So for people looking for exclusivity, this is the right choice. I myself, prefer a hotel that is right at the centre since the walking took forever for me (im a slow walker) and any other hotels at the centre is mostly sky scrapper anyway, so staying in high floor wont trouble would eliminate noise issue. Another thing to mention is that, the electricity shut off automatically at check out time (11.00), which I think is very cool and a good way to discourage people to stay past check out time!

OK...a few things you need to know about this place prior to staying here. Make sure you ask for a quiet room. I read some reviews about guests being upset due to the sound of the train. We asked for a quiet room in advance and were very pleased. The hotel is smoke free which is perfect since we don't smoke. It was so great to have nice towels that didn't smell like smoke and bleach like some of the other resorts on the strip. Main lobby is decked out and very pretty. Wanted to get a Trump shirt at the gift shop, but they didn't have my size available. Had lunch at DJTs, nothing to write home to mom about. Pool was heated during winter months which was nice. You will be charged a resort fee of around $20 a night. Now the bad stuff...for some reason our bed leaned to the left side like it was broken. I asked someone in housekeeping to come look at it and nothing was done about it. Instead of signs that you would hang on the door, they have a little button you push from the inside of your room that lights up when you want your room cleaned. Ours was lit up and we didn't get our room cleaned once while we were there. We still left a tip though. When I made the reservation I was told that the resort had a 24 hour shuttle to the Wynn since there is no casino at Trump. This was confirmed again a second time upon check in. When we got into the shuttle van, the driver told us to make sure we meet him at the Wynn location by 11:50pm. I asked him if the shuttle ran 24 hours. He said no. We walked back to the resort at 1:00am. Also, there is a TV in the mirror of the bathroom which is kinda neat. The only problem was that we couldn't turn it off and it stayed on the whole time we were there. All the other buttons on the TV remote worked except the On/Off button. It worked well as a nightlight. The spa tub was great which we used. The bathroom lights had a layer of dust on them that anyone would notice right away. They must not have been cleaned since the hotel first opened. I cleaned them myself (wait...I'm on vacation remember?) The elevators here are the fastest rides in all of Vegas. We were on the 22nd floor and it took maybe 5 seconds to get there. Bathrobes should also have been in our room, but those were missing too.

The whole point of my review is that amenities such as internet connection, newspaper even the shuttle you are writing about is included in most high-tier hotels I know like the Marriott. But the Trump is greedy and wants more and more. The internet and newspaper is standard in most hotels without paying extra. It was just the two things that I happened to mention. And then you posted a litany of things that the $20/day resort fee pays for. First of all, unfortunately, except for the internet and newspaper (which I hardly read). I did not use the shuttle because we had a rental car. I did not use the Spa, I did not use or buy at the Shop. I did not use ANYTHING that you claim is included in the $20/day. That makes it a rip-off for me! Okay, I don't get this. You ask me to pay so I could get a discount to go to your shop to buy things at the Trump shop, that give you more revenue. Now, tell me. Why would I do that? And all those things that you wrote down on your post as a reply to my review should be included in your exorbitantly priced room rate. That is why we paid for almost $350/night. The litany of things you wrote should be included in the cost of the room, hence the high cost of the room. My point is that, it isn't enough for Trump to charge $350/per/night. You had to throw in the $20 resort fee on top of the exorbitantly priced room. Just imagine this Brian. I paid $350/per night per room. That is more than $1,500 just for my stay. You're telling me $1,500 is not enough to pay for internet, newspaper, bottled water?The shuttle I never used, the Spa I never used, the swimming pool I never used, the shop I never bought from? Really? That is not enough for the Trump? That is why my review is such! It is exorbitant and a waste of hard earned dollars. And the Trump thinks he can do this and get away with it. I personally do not like the guy Trump either because he is sleazy. And this stay at his hotel just proves it. Imagine that Brian, multiply that by the number of people staying at the hotel every night, 24/7, 365 a year? Imagine these people staying at your high priced hotel each and every day. That isn't enough to pay for the internet? And how about the economies of scale of your hotel? Isn't that enough? From the look of it, IT IS NOT. The Trump, wants more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more and more, more, more, more and more. It is simply greed.

Contemporary design, stainless steel kitchenette, elegant bathroom, you name it. We were completely stoked. The photos do no justice. The room was so clean and comfy, it felt like we were the first ones to stay in there. I liked that the hotel had a great location. It is right across the fashion mall which I found very convenient especially since we did not bring much clothes and needed to find something and get ready before we went out. The hotel is also right off the main strip far enough from the commotion and noise but close enough to walk.

I didn\u2019t have high expectations for the hotel, and certainly not a lot of respect for Trump himself, but his hotel really delivered. Pros: The rooms were spacious and luxurious and the bathroom was awesome. The pool is beautiful and very large, not to mention efficient as it\u2019s both a lap pool + hang-out pool. The pool deck provides lots of space, and the two hidden hot tubs are great after a long day in Vegas during the cooler months. All staff that we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. The \u2018off-strip\u2019 location some people claim was not accurate to our group. With an \u2018on-strip\u2019 hotel, the amount of time it takes you to walk through the lobbies/casinos/past the mobs of people to make it to the Strip is ridiculous. At Trump you can simply walk out of the hotel directly, plus a 3 min walk down the road to the Strip. You go from room to strip in less than 5 minutes, no fuss. Not to mention it\u2019s the North end of the Strip, which I find more appealing as it\u2019s the newer end with great hotels like the Wynn, Palazzo, Venetian\u2026. and the Fashion Show Mall. The \u2018off strip\u2019 location is not an issue at all. Cons: Yes, you do hear the train. We upgraded to a strip side room after hearing the train getting out at the valet. On the strip side we heard it only once during our stay. I can\u2019t say how loud it is on the other side. It\u2019s almost as if Trump did not install proper windows for the location. As other reviews have mentioned, some of the furniture is showing a wear and tear, and the carpet is looking worn. The most important part though, the bed, does not indicate that. I asked myself if I was Donald Trump staying in this room, would it be acceptable \u2013 and the answer was no, there were too many dings and dents that didn\u2019t add up to 5 star perfection. Little things like \u2013 not all dishes/appliances etc are available in the room, you have to call down and request them. Same thing with bathrobes and slippers. The pool and gym, believe it or not, does not have a change room, so you have to either walk down to the restaurant and use a washroom there, or go back up to your room.

I will list the good and the bad, but in my opinion this Las Vegas hotel is a definite winner. First the good stuff. The hotel is amazingly classy - everything is first class, from the arrival & stylishly-adorned entry foyer to the high speed elevators. The interior is clearly- made with class and distinction in mind. This continues to the rooms. There is absolutely no need to pay extra money for a \"strip view\" room ... the less expensive mountain view rooms are identically-apportioned and provide a stunning display of not only the mountains but downtown Vegas, too. The rooms are large with first-class contemporary furnishings and thick, down-filled bedspreads. There is a relaxing sitting area near the large windows. Strangely - the rooms have a small kitchenette. It's simply weird, but they come equipped with a small range and some seriously-excellent cabinetry with fancy self-closing drawers. If you can figure out why Mr. Trump put these in, you're better than I. They're utterly useless, even if you wanted to \"cook in your room\". But, the utensils are pure awesome, right down to the Le Creuset tea kettle. These rooms even have an imbedded TV in the bath mirror. The bathrooms are made with a large, uh umm \"2-person\" shower, and the tile work was stunning. The bath was huge, deep and had whirlpool jets. Trump hotel in Vegas is not a casino - it's best described as a classy place to crash when you're spending time in Vegas. While the rooms and decor are amazing, the Trump hotel is not a place to hang out during your stay. It has a nice restaurant, though the place was literally deserted when we dined there in early December ... a full course dinner and good bottle of wine will run you $130. The bar is quiet and comfortable, too. I had absolutely no problems whatsoever with the service here or anywhere at Trump. The hotel staff was courteous, prompt and helpful.Lets talk negatives. Trump hotel is not conveniently-located for walking to other resorts. It looks like it is, because the Wynn & Encore seem to literally loom over Trump's hotel. But Trump is tucked away on a busy commercial street on the backside of a Nordstrom's department store, and the lofty height of the surrounding resorts deceptively-masks the true distance from Trump to these other properties. For example, walking to Wynn will take you an easy 15-20 minutes, and add 5 more for Ceasars front entrance. Donald has tried to accommodate this by offering free shuttle service to both Wynn & Caesars, but it's not a timely ride and there's just one van, so you're either packed into the thing like a sardine with other guests, or you're standing around waiting for what seems like way too long for the shuttle to show up. It is free, though, so I'm not complaining - just stating the facts. We followed the example of a lot of other guests and took a cab instead. The cab fare for a 1-way ride to Caesars front entrance is $10, and since you get to go promptly on your own schedule, I recommend you shell out the money for cabs instead of dealing with the shuttle.Here is a tip! A cab ride from Trump hotel to McCarran airport should cost no more than $20 (including tip), as long as you make sure to tell the cab driver NOT to take the interstate (taking the interstate route is not faster and only adds to the cab fare). Instead - tell your driver to take \"Paradise Blvd.\", as it's quicker and there are fewer delays. Our ride took us 15 minutes. By the way, I got this tip from a cab driver who took us from Ceasars back to Trump, and he was totally correct. The reason this trip is quicker & cheaper is that there's a shortcut for \"taxis only\" that cuts through Encore. It shaves 10 minutes off of your airport trip.So there's my summary of Trump Hotel. Its a wonderful, quiet and relaxing place to stay, nicely unique in that it's absent the usual Vegas sleaze, noise & putrid smoke-filled air (by the way - that's a very good thing). But, it's not a place to gamble or watch strippers ... If you want to physically be where you can play, shop or absorb the Hangover sin-city stuff, then you'll have the at-times irritating chore of dealing with the free shuttle or shelling out $10 for a cab ride to the nearest strip resort (Wynn or Ceasars). But, I would definitely stay at Trump hotel again, as I personally prefer the former for accommodations.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ON, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "time_to_relax", "ReviewID": "UR121465879", "Content": "My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Trump Las Vegas.

While I have no interest in lining Mr. Trump's pockets, I was curious about his hotel property in Sin City. The just-off-the-Strip location, valet-only parking, and casino- and smoke-free environs all appealed to me, as did the prospect of staying in a spacious 5-star condo studio. My prepaid booking was for a regular (\"city view\") studio suite, which seemed more than adequate as a base for weekend vacation operations in Vegas and southern Utah. I read some of the TA reviews of the Trump before booking and, as always, found most to be helpful. I particularly appreciated fellow reviewers' comments on the rooms' amenities and possible noise from the nearby train. I was impressed with the Trump as soon as I arrived: efficient, friendly valet service; and a welcoming, lovely, fragrant lobby/reception area. The Trump certainly looked the part of a new 5-star Vegas hotel. I was the only guest checking in at 8 p.m. on Wednesday evening, and the front-desk clerk was friendly and helpful. She asked my preference re higher or lower floor (I said the former), and I asked for a room, if possible, facing away from the train tracks. She not only accommodated that request but also upgraded me to a Strip-view studio suite. Good start. My room was lovely and very comfortable. I imagine that the standard studio layout (main room a bit narrow but still very spacious and attractive; with a huge bathroom seemingly almost half the size of the living area) would be more than adequate for almost all guests traveling either alone or as a couple. Contrary to a few reviewers' gripes about the view of the Strip from their rooms, I found the view from my 58th-floor room to be one of the best I've seen in many Vegas stays. And I've had lovely strip-view rooms at the Wynn Encore, Vdara, Treasure Island, Mirage, and Mandarin Oriental. The Strip-view rooms look right over the Strip heading south, with the airport to the left and mountains behind -- particularly beautiful at night. Oh, I did hear the train whistle a few times, but it never woke me up. I rather liked, as did my brother and sister-in-law, the plaintive sound in an urban setting. The windows in the room were perfect: huge but well insulated, giving the Strip its due view while keeping undue noise out. I liked the look of -- but hardly used -- the fully equipped kitchen, and appreciated the free good-quality coffee and bottles of water. As for the $20/day resort fee, so many hotels in Vegas charge something similar or more -- while often offering fewer amenities for the tacked-on additional cost -- that I didn't (and don't) really have any beef with the Trump re this. The internet alone is almost worth the fee: as in the Encore, it's 20 MBPS, which is 10 to 40 times faster than the \"free\" internet that many other Vegas hotels have. And I appreciated the valet-only parking; with one exception, service was fast and friendly. The bathroom in the suite deserves special mention; it's very luxurious, with marble everywhere, two sinks, and a huge stand-alone walk-in shower. I didn't try the equally huge jetted bathtub. I called down on two of my four days for the optional evening turn down service, and I'm glad I did. The maids freshened the room and left more water and some great chocolate bonbons. I ate at the DJT restaurant twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch. The food and service were very good -- expensive, but not inordinately so. DJT wasn't a culinary blowout, but it was good as a convenient come-as-you-are dining fallback. Why am I giving the Trump just 4 rather than 5 points, despite my mostly glowing review? If I could give a 4.5, I would. I suppose I'm withholding the 5th point for subjective reasons; while very nice, I liked the 5-star competition I've tried in Vegas a bit better than I did the Trump -- although I'd rate it higher than the Venetian. I particularly liked the Encore and Vdara (although I also gave the Vdara 4 points). The Trump, while lovely, feels a bit generic, and the furniture and trim in my room was already showing some wear and tear. Overall, I'd highly recommend the Trump to most travelers. I saw a few guests with children -- and more with pets -- although most seemed to be well heeled singles and couples. The hushed, luxurious feeling at the Trump is a pleasant contrast to the constant bling, bustle, and smoke of Strip hotels.

I had prebooked and prepaid with one of the hotel booking websites and when I went to check in it was very busy. Good sign with a great buzz and nice feeling about the place. My very first impression was the receptionist just saw me as an oppurtunity to upsell. Without as much as a greeting I was offered a booklet showing me the upgrade room options. I couldnt but help notice that this was going on all around me. I have no problem with this but a greeting would have been nice beforehand. I stayed with my original choice of rooms and I have to say both the rooms were very nice. The second room I had booked has a sofa bed pull out which was going to be used. Advised at time of booking and at check in. We checked in around 4.00pm and called down requesting bedding for the sofa bed. We were assured it would arrive within a short period of time. After the check in we went for a little walk about returning to the room at 6.00pm. Still no sign of the sofa bed bedding. I called down to housekeeping again and was assured it would be up straight away. We went our for dinner and a show and returned around midnight.... you guessed no bedding... A further call to housekeeping and reception and eventually the guy who answered my call said sorry and that he could see from the log my calls. He assured me he would personally look after it and true to his word he did. Its a great pity that trump hasnt more guys like that working. Hats off to him. Its a good 4 star property but lacks the personal touch that true 5 star hotels always have regardless of how busy they are. Food at the cocktail bar was okay and well priced during happy hour. Overall a good experience and the noise from the trains which some reported on was no bother at all. Cannot see how this would keep one awake all night.

We arrived very late, around 12:30am to a very attentive front desk staff. The lobby was open and decorated in grand style, meaning everything, from flowers to vases to chandeliers were larger than life. Security checked each person for a room key as they entered the elevator bay. The room, 2823, was down a long hallway. A door concealed the foyer which was the entryway to 2 rooms. The doors were very large and noisy when someone left, The Trump was originally built as a condo-hotel and that shows in some of the room details: double closets, shelving, furniture. The room came fully equipped with dishes, pots, pans, coffee maker, toaster, refrigerator (but no freezer compartment), microwave and stovetop. The bathroom was very large with a huge shower, separate toilet and a large soaking tub from which you could watch the TV which was somehow fixed in the mirror. The shelving and drawers were not deep. The towels were average and despite the floor being marble like, no anti-slip devices were used. The attention to detail was lacking in the room. No pillows, aside from the bed were available for the 3rd person sleeping on the sofa bed (which was sufficiently uncomfortable that teen slept on the sofa on nights 2 and 3 rather than making it into a bed). The iron was missing, only 1 robe was provided and only 6 hangers were in the closet. Even at 1am, a pillow was quickly delivered by housekeeping. Extra hangers and an iron were delivered the next morning. The valet parking situation was horrible. A lane for taxis, a lane for dropping people and a lane for valets were almost always full, particularly during the evening. We frequently left the car while my husband sat and waited for the valets and or a lane to become available, up to 20 minutes on one occasion. Valet parking is the only option. One other issue, for those allergic to perfumes or flowers, the lobby had an odd aroma. The night we checked in, we thought it was from the stargazer lilies in the huge arrangement. However, in the next couple of days, each time we arrived in the lobby, this slightly sweet and cloying smell was overpowering. Hubby though it might be a Trump fragrance. Whatever it was, I didn't like it. Also, with no coffee shop in the building, breakfast was difficult. We ended up going across the street to the Fashion Show Mall which has coffee shops as well as a food court. With no stop lights close by, we jay walked and had to dodge the traffic. We weren't the only ones and it appears a crosswalk may be installed. Overall, it was a good place to stay, clean, mostly quiiet.

The Trump was it! We also were hoping to be near, but not right on the Strip and the Trump answered that need as well. The stunning lobby was an oasis of calm and luxury, check-in smooth and efficient, the elevators, hallways were elegantly designed and finished. Our suite, on a high floor, was beautifully furnished in a sleek modern style. Very luxurious bathroom with marble finishing, in-mirror TV , double sinks (handy for getting ready efficiently), multiple drawers and nooks in the vanity for makeup and hair essentials, walk-in shower and separate toilet enclosure. Room service was speedy, very friendly and professional, quite delicious and not extravagantly expensive. I say this to contrast with the 'dining room' which in design and function looks like an afterthought. It's located off the beautiful lobby with a promising entrance, but inside is a sad cavern of a room, weirdly dark without being romantic or the dimness intentionally being a part of the 'ambiance', oddly glaring lights, strangely bereft of decor and the staff, also somewhat lacking the professionalism and pleasantness obvious everywhere else in the hotel. It was almost like walking into a completely different 1 or 2 star hotel with its attached restaurant. We made the mistake of trying to have breakfast here once, one morning. That was enough. The train noise was only noticeable occasionally and I don't think it ever disturbed our sleep. I can't remember our exact floor, but we were quite high and perhaps that's a factor in the noise. A big plus for me, location wise, was that it was right across the street from the Fashion Mall, with Nordstrom's anchoring the near end.

Starting however from the positive side: the room was rather large, modernly equipped and stylish. Bathroom was even luxuriously large and well equipped. The location is also pretty good, stating that the hotel is on strip is not really true, but it's close enough to conveniently walk to strip and there's also free shuttle service to strip. Then on the negative issues: we had made the reservation for 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids). When we got into our room around 11 p.m. we noticed that there were bedsheets, towels etc only for 2. We called housekeeping and they brought extra bedsheets and made the bed for kids. No towels however, so we requested them again from the housekeepers. They promised to bring those. At 1.30 a.m. we were woke up by housekeeping bringing another set of bedsheets (?), still no towels... Next day we asked from the reception if we could get two additional towels as well as bathrobes which there had been none. We also complained having the room prepared only for 2 even though the reservation was made for 4. They replied that according to their systems the reservation was only made for 2. I double checked the reservation and in my confirmation e-mail it says the reservation was in fact made for 4. During our 3 night stay we never received the promised bathrobes. Towels we did receive after the first night. This in itself is not acceptable for a 5 star hotel. But the worst thing, and the reason why I will never ever go back, is the noise from the nearby going trains. For some reason the trains use their horns when passing by and in practice that meant waking up every night every couple of hours... Talk about relaxing vacation and sleeping well... Afterwards I read some other complaints of the noise and recommendation to get the room as high as possible to avoid the noise. Wish I had read this before. We were staying on floor 34 and that obviously was not high enough. Also one minor thing, but something that should be in order in a 5 star hotel, is cleaning. Even though the rooms were rather clean all the bathroom lamps were covered in dust.

Check in was a breeze and we were offered a choice to upgrade our room at an additional price, it was worth it, the view of the strip was amazing, especially at night - gorgeous! We were also given complimentary bubbles and fruit as we had let them know we were celebrating an engagement. The room was huge! So much room, felt like a home away from home - with a full kitchen and two bathrooms. Rooms were cleaned daily and staff were very friendly. As for the train - yes you do hear it, but for me I just fell back asleep after it so wasn't that much of an issue. The shuttle which goes to Caesar's Palace does get a little full especially when people are wanting to go back to the hotel at about 11pm. Be prepared to wait a little bit to get a ride back to the hotel in the evening - some hotel guests even push their way onto the shuttle just to get on it - one evening we had to wait for 3 shuttles to pass because people kept pushing in. (Would be handy if the shuttle at night was a bit bigger or they had some sort of area where people could line up so other people wouldn't jump the queue).

We found it good value for our family of five where we needed a kitchenette to prepare meals for our little ones and the extra room for kids to play. The hotels entrance and lobby is highlighted in the Trump's signature gold but they manage to marry this with more muted tones and tasteful furnishings in the rest of the hotel's decor. We booked a studio and 1 bedroom suite/apartment. The one bedroom was so large that we really didn't need the studio for my mum. We only took the studio on advisement from reservations when we booked over the phone. A rollaway bed for her would have been suffice. Rooms are super clean and tastefully furnished. View were amazing! I was really happy with the huge cot they sent for our 2+yo toddler who is a bit tall for his age and at most hotels, the cots were a squeeze for him. It had a brand new mattress as well which was nice. The luxurious bathroom was massive with a spa bath and large shower, double vanity. It had a fabulous view to boot. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in - even tops Westin's Heavenly bed if that's anything to go by. Complimentary wifi and bottled water. In fact, when I called to request some extra bottles of water, the staff showed up with a whole bag - some 6-8 bottles. Our kids had the best fun in the pool - nice size, good cabanas, not over crowded. Serviced by really nice staff at the pools snack bar. Lifeguard on duty. I found the staff really down to earth and friendly. I expected snooty but was pleasantly surprised and impressed. Front desk was super efficient and welcoming. On the day we left, we were so behind time and in a frantic rush to get to the airport. We had so much luggage that getting a large cab was going to be a slow process so they quickly arranged for a private car to take us and it wasn't even expensive.

There was ample closet space and drawers with bathrobes provided. The mini kitchen had a stove top and a mini refrigerator with cooking and dining utensils provided. There was a large screen LCD tv and a very comfortable bed in the room with room service every day that was exceptional. The value this hotel represents in terms of price and what it delivers in amenities is probably scarce in Vegas. The only minus I could say about this place was the limited dining options within the hotel Even though there are several restaurants and room service available the fare offered was rather unappealing, but then again there hundreds of places within a 10 min shuttle trip or a short cab ride. The Vegas Fashion Mall is also across the street for those who feel the urge. Finally, there are some reviews here that state this is a 5 Star Hotel and how it falls short. Let me assert that no where does this Hotel represent itself as a 5 Star facility and the price they charge is on par with what a 3 star place or what many generic national chains charge.

From here, you could still occasionally hear the train but was far far more bearable, and slept well from then on. The hotel is itself is fine; only just off the strip, no more than 5 minutes walk, so no problems at all. Happy hours(s) at the bar every night, 5 dollars for cocktails.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the greatest thing is that there is no casino in there!! All of the other casino hotels we visited directed you through the casino to get out onto the road, whereas Trump is a standard hotel lobby that you walk straight out onto the road. The rooms in the hotel are amazing - we upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite (room 5925) and the room and the view were out of this world!! The beds are soooo comfy and there are loads of pillows and sheets if you like to have the air con on high and then snuggle up!! The location of the hotel was ideal - it is slightly off the strip and opposite the Nordstrum entrance to the Fashion Show Mall. There are courtesy buses that run from the hotel every 10-15 minutes to the Wynn and Caesars Palace. To walk to the strip takes approximately 4 minutes so we didn't really bother with the Wynn bus!!The pool area is spotless and a really lovely place to relax - beware of the drink prices though!! Now onto Vegas - what a place!! There is so much to do besides gambling and it would take all day to go through it all so I though i'd give you a run down of my favourites: * Stratosphere - go and see the sunset from the 107 bar. If you go between 4 and 7 it is happy hour with all martini's on 241. If you purchase 2 drinks you can go up to the observation deck for free (standard cost $16 per person). As the martini's work out at $12 for 2 it only costs $24 for 2 martini's and a fantastic view! * Coyote Ugly Bar in New York New York - what a fantastic place!!! It is exactly like the film and is so much fun. * Freemont Street - this is another fun place to go and has a laser show on the ceiling every hour from dusk. It is really something to go and watch and the casino's in general pay more than the ones on the strip * Wynn breakfast buffet - $19.95 each for all you can eat and the quality and variety of the food is amazing!!! We ate here twice we loved it that much and we also paid $10 each for unlimited champagne - get there for about 9.30 and take your time!!! * Treasure Island show - this was great fun and of really high quality and best of all it's free!! * Bellagio Fountains - everthing you would expect and more. We watched this over 6 times and every time I filled up!! * Mon Ami Gabi restaurant at the Paris hotel - this is right opposite the Bellagio Fountains and if you can get a table outside you can watch the fountains whilst you eat!! * Deuce and Downtown Strip bus - $7 for 24 hours and it takes you all the way from the Southern shopping mall to the Northern shopping mall with all of the stops in between. You can hop on and hop off when you like and it is a must for getting to Freemont Street! There is obviously so much more than this to do - I have just put some of my favourites down!

Housekeeping could not fail to see them but figured I wouldn't and put the pillowcases on anyway. 2nd visit: Loved the idea of a kitchenette, just not a dirty one and what are two people going to do with one glass and one fork? 3rd visit: Contents of bedside table: Torn condom wrapper, 3 more unopened ones, empty gum package, used chapstick and used food wrapper.

There was even a TV in the bathroom mirror! I visited on Veteran's day weekend and I was attending a Marine Corps Birthday Ball. My wife was in a Beautiful Ball gown and I was in my evening dress uniform and the bellman quickly grabbed my attention and led my wife and I to a black Chevy Tahoe and we were given a complimentary drive to the hotel where the ball was taking place. We did not ask for this in anyway and we were actually a little confused because it came as a complete surprise, but it really went a long way to make us feel special. We also requested and was given a DVD player for FREE, but you have to sign an agreement that you will turn it in or be charged $50. I have very few, small complaints. We did find a cigarette butt in the bathroom. We had to call for linen for the pull out because there was none in the room. And I was not prepared for the $100 dollar incidental they put on your card when you check in. Lastly Cell phone coverage is bad, even up on the 39th floor. The hotel was VERY accommodating for out checkout. We called them from the Caesar because we knew we would not make it back by check out time (which they gladly delayed until 1pm) They checked us out over the phone and immediately emailed me a receipt so I could review it. They even held my vehicle in valet and our luggage until 5pm even though we checked out and they did not charge us for it. This service also DID NOT require 20 dollar tips to make happen, it was just good customer service. No staff member was out to make money off of us just to give good service. Everybody was friendly. Doors were always opened, valet and transportation was very accommodating and efficient. Although some may complain about it not being on the strip and not having clubs and casinos, we like that because it keeps the hotel a little calmer and quieter and it attracts a more mature crowd. Las Vegas Blvd is a five minute walk away. And the hotel offers a FREE shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's palace and the driver was funny and more than willing to help with our stroller, and did not expect a tip for it. The train noise was there, but it never bothered my sleep. (I was on the 39th floor, strip view).

Check in was also a little slow with only 2 people working at the desk which is unfortunate when you have two small children waiting with you :).

He was very helpful once in the room, he knew his stuff. The strip view one bedroom suite was plush, more than sufficient, and surprisingly exactly as described. Plenty of room, I didn't feel gross about letting my 1 yr old on the floor to play. The kitchen is perfect. Even has an oven, toaster, and ice in the freezer. It was superbly clean. I wouldnt exactly call the pullout couch luxury. The mattress was thin but worked fine for a night. We also had to call down for extra linens for the pullout and it took a little while to get them. I assumed they would be provided already. We also requested a DVD player for the kids and they had someone there quickly and efficiently. The view was great from the 39th floor. Huge windows my kids loved looking out of. The trains ARE very close and can be seen and heard from the strip view but it wasn't an issue at all. The bedroom was roomy and the bed very comfy. Plenty of room for me my husband and our 3 yr old. The bathrooms are also very nice. Yes bathroomSSS. There is one in the main room with a shower and the one in the bedroom? Wow. It's enormous. The tub is large enough for a couple, the double shower is more than enough room, and the toilet is behind it's own door. It was quiet, fashion show is right across the street and has anything you need or want, there is no loud, sad, smokey casino to walk through which is pleasant when you have children with you. True, it's not on the strip but there is also no casino attached that is designed to funnel you around to keep you from leaving. If there was a casino, attached it would take the 10 mins it does require to get to the strip, just to get through it. They won't nickel and dime you and seem to welcome the person and not just their money. My one complaint is that the room could use a touch of TLC. Furnishings were scratched and dented. Wear and tear galore. Carpet under table and chairs was frayed and the vanity in the bathroom just needed to be replaced. The worst of it was that the toilet needed a good scrub and we found a cigarette butt sitting on the bathroom sconce. Apparently, housekeeping needs a little more attention to detail. This was a nonsmoking room although I did pick up on a faint smoke smell upon entering. I thought it was just me (Vegas in general is pretty smelly) until my husband found the cigarette butt hanging out. All that said I'd absolutely stay again. For romance, family, or business it's a great hotel. If you're a gambler,probably not your place.

Friendly too, with no snooty attitude that one can sometimes encounter when checking in prepaid via Priceline. Plus 3: EASY, SHORT walk to your room. A rarity in Vegas. Save the miles for strip-walking. (we sure did plenty of that, so being able to quickly get to our room when we got back each day was nice!) Plus 4: Rooms are two per suite area, so you have the added security of an extra door. Plus 5: JACUZZI. Not just a boring big tub. (let bubble bath search commence...but remember to only use a TEENY bit). Plus 6: Fridge (and other kitchen things that would only be a plus imho if we were staying longer than 3 nights). Plus7: Buttons by door that you can use to indicate privacy or housekeeping. Very classy and worked like a charm. Plus 8: Room service. Top-notch. Friendly. Quick. And surprisingly less expensive than I've seen in hotels in Vegas and other cities. We ordered a burger one night and it was good, with waffle fries, came with cute little bottles of mustard, ketchup and a teeny tiny Tabasco! We had them bring up a corkscrew also, which we were surprised wasn't already in the room. Plus 9: Courtesy Shuttle. We NEVER had to wait more than 2 minutes for it. Drivers were very friendly. Took us to either the Encore or a very convenient location at the Forum Shoppes. (underground, with an escalator that comes out right in front of Spago). Never ever had such quick, friendly shuttle service at a hotel anywhere before! Plus 10: Location isn't bad anyway. Cross the street (be careful) and you are in the Fashion Mall and on your way to wherever you want to go. Note that there is an ABC store in the mall that has wine, munchies, sparkling water...pretty much anything you might need. Also note that when you come out of the mall on Las Vegas Blvd, that is where the Tix 4 Tonite booth is so you can see if you want any discount tix or meal discounts. We bought Absinthe tix there, saved money on it, and the show was very entertaining! Plus 11: Housekeeping...excellent! Bless their hearts (see minuses 2-10 below) Minus 1: No robes in room. (easily rectified by a call to the front desk, also had extra towels brought up in anticipation of jacuzzi usage). Minus 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10: The TOILET. We HATED this toilet. You can't tell me that Donald Trump or anyone in his family have ever used this toilet or one like it. Heck our old ones here at home are considerably better. It was the WORST toilet we have EVER had to deal with. Now even though it was supposed to be Trump opulence, we didn't expect a golden throne or anything, but this porcelain puny had a plastic lid (no big deal, but unexpected in a 5-star).... the PROBLEM was that it would barely flush. I realize the idea is to save energy, water, etc., but how much of a savings is it when you have to flush 3 times (waiting in between each time for the tank to fill up)? Not only was the suckage power non-existent, but there was no water that would go around the basin, making flushing fairly useless, beyond frustrating and flat-out embarrassing at times. God help Housekeeping here! (Hope everyone believes in tipping Housekeeping like we do). Minus 11: The view. If you get \"city view\" like we did, it means a view of the Erotic Heritage Museum (which doesn't seem to get any traffic), and other such lovely landmarks. Not a biggie to us as we didn't spend much time in the room, but if it's important to you ask for a different view. Minus 12: The train. I'm only putting this as a minus because I know it would bother a lot of folks. To us having spent a year and a half dealing with downtown DC noises, it was no big deal. But yes it would wake us up several times each night. Overall impressions...this hotel feels more like 4 stars than 5. Whereas service was definitely 5-star in all regards (front desk, housekeeping, shuttle drivers, room service, security guard in lobby)... furniture, bedding, etc. was more 4-star than 5. Toilet alone makes it impossible to rate it a 5. It feels like a 4-star hotel that could be in any city anywhere. There's nothing that cries out VEGAS RESORT. And THAT is a plus or minus depending on how you look at it.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat service and room.\u201d", "Author": "Bmoron", "ReviewID": "UR120380006", "Content": "My wife and I stayed 3 nights in October.

Spectacular and simple to look at from the outside, this hotel stands out at the top end of the strip and can be seen most of the way up, if walking/driving from Mandalay upto Fashion Show Mall. We arrived on 24/10 and stayed for 8 nights for a special anniversary - not realising at the time of booking that it was also Halloween weekend. The hotel did not seem to be full, from what we could see and hear, but like all Vegas weekends, it did get considerably busier from the Friday night, ready for the Haloween parties in various hotel nightclubs, and the spectacle of people dressed up all day long for 3 solid days walking/posing up and down the strip (most fun Halloween we've ever had!!) We booked a city view studio, but as we had e-mailed previously asking for a high room due to the train noise we had read about on Trip Advisor, the hotel upgraded us for our anniversary to a Strip View studio on the 57th floor (room 5707) which had the most amazing view we could have hoped for. I do not believe that there could be any better view of the strip from any hotel - so much so, that I did not close my curtains throughout he whole stay, to make sure that I could see the lights at all times (if I just sat up in bed, I had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains). I counted 23 hotels in view from the room, from the Wynn at the West, to Mandalay at the South and Rio/Palms at the East. The room itself is very good, and is very similar to a Studio in The Signature at MGM (I gave Signature 1 extra point for having a small dining table which was missing from Trump - it was nice to have breakfast in the room and sit at a table rather than on a sofa). It is open plan with a very comfortable bed, 3 seater sofa and 2 armchairs, small writing desk and chair, plus kitchenette, with fridge, (stock up on milk/bagels etc in Walgreens over at Palazzo for a cheap breakfast in room) hob, microwave, toaster, blender and coffee maker (coffee provided in room as part of resort fee. This also includes 2 bottled water per day, plus daily newspaper. We did not use the free wireless as we were on holiday, so did NOT want to be contacting the outside world!!! but we did use the business centre to check in on-line and print off boarding cards, which is also part of the fee). The room also had the most storage space I have ever seen in any style room/suite, including 2 full wardrobes, drawers and at least 6 other cupboard spaces. The bathroom was lovely with double jacuzzi bath, double marble vanity sink (with the fun tv in the mirror), double shower, and toilet behind a heavy frosted glass door that did slam hard if you forgot to close it all the way. Did I mention the view.............? I do have to mention the train noise. Yes, we could hear it, very clearly, all the way up on the 57th floor, and could see it clearly on the East side of the room (counted a train with 92 containers at one time. No passenger trains use the line, just cargo). To be honest, it could be a problem if you are on lower floors as it is noisy when they sound their horn.....for long periods of time....at 3am!!! but we actually got used to it and didn't seem to notice it after a while. It didn't ruin my stay in any way, as i'm sure that not may Vegas hotels are quiet - after all, this is the city that absolutely never goes to bed, and there is constant noise one way or the other!! Also, I am certain that this noise could also be heard if staying on the \"wrong side\" of the hotel in TI, Mirage, Rio and Palms, plus Palazzo and Wynn to a degree. While checking in, the employee noted that we were celebrating our anniversary, and asked if we had plans to see any shows. As we had previously seen Ka, and fallen under the Cirque spell, we had planned to see Mystere and told her so. She then pointed out that Trump had a promotion with TI for \"2 for 1\" tickets, for Mystere specifically, so this was a great saving for us. I can not really comment on any other aspects of service, as it was not needed, except for housekeeping. When we got back to our room from dinner out on our first night, I noticed that we had no robes. I called housekeeping, and within 2 minutes, they arrived. At that very moment, I was also unpacking, and found only 4-5 hangers in the wardrobe. I asked the staff member with the robes for 3-4 more hangers, and he came back within another 2 minutes with 10 more. I was impressed as this was after 11pm, and normally housekeeping is not so efficient at this time of day. To be honest, when we are in Vegas, we walk the Strip and eat out at every opportunity, so we did not use any further facilities of the hotel, eg pool, Spa or restaurants. The location of the hotel is set back off the Strip without it being too far away, but it makes it much quieter and also easier to walk back to your room, rather than jostling the crowds and cigarette smoke (non smoking hotel with a permanent spa style fragrance, makes it a literal breath of fresh air from the majority of other hotels). It is incrediby easy to walk to the strip by either walking 3 minutes on the road (prefectly safe at all times of day/night, with pavement and lighting) which brings you out at the crossroads by Wynn/Palazzo and Fashion Show Mall, or from 10am-8pm, you can walk straight over the road from the lobby area, directly into Nordstrom, which is part of the Fashion Show Mall. If you can not walk far, or plan to visit the far top or bottom end of the Strip, you can take the Deuce bus from outside the Fashion Show or Wynn for 7$ per person for 24hours, which is a a real bargain and leg saver!! We used it to visit the Premium Outlets South, which is the last stop on the route before turning around (also can recommend Town Square for a different feel to Vegas shopping). Lastly, I will mention the great complimentary shuttle service that runs every 10-15 minutes (not sure what time it starts as we always liked to walk in the morining) until approx midnight to Wynn (very lazy to take this unless have a problem walking) or Ceasars. The drivers were excellent with great personalities. You can always get a taxi from outside the hotel as they are always queuing up on the road to the side for potential customers. It is approx 20$ to the airport. We would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone, and will look at staying here again on our next Vegas trip in the near future.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Property!

I liked that there was a sofa and chairs which were really good for putting your feet up after a long day of exploring and gambling on the strip. The bathroom was a big, with shower and jacuzzi bath. After seeing some of the other hotels we were glad that the hotel didn't have a casino and was smoke free. It's only a 5 - 10 minute walk down to the strip, or for during the heat of the day you can cross straight over from the hotel into the air conditioned Fashion Show Mall. We used the free shuttle bus to the Forum shops which saved a bit of walking went we went to explore the lower end of the strip. All the staff we encountered, from reception staff to the valets were always very helpful and polite and we were never kept waiting very long for anything. The only negative for us was the trains using their horns at various times through the night, waking us up.

There is no casino, no night club, and no smoking. TRANSLATION: The place is dead and boring! The room was okay, I would compare it to one of the better hotel chains like the Doubletree or Hilton. In comparison to most high-end Casino/Hotel rooms like the Palazzo, the room accomodations here look like a cheap Motel 6 room. Their standard rooms only come with one king bed, and a very uncomfortable sofa pullout bed. We asked the front desk if we could get an upgraded room with two beds, since I am male and I don't like sleeping with my male friend. Hotwire books you the room without a bed preference. They said the only rooms that had more than one bed were their penthouses and they are reserved. They were really snobby about it too. THIS PLACE IS NOT ON THE STRIP, ALTHOUGH HOTWIRE WILL SELL YOU A ROOM THERE AND SAY ITS ON THE NORTH END OF THE STRIP. IF YOU WANT TO VISIT THE STRIP, EXPECT TO DRIVE, , TAKE A LONG WALK, PAY FOR A CAB, OR ATTEMPT TO GET ON THEIR RIDICULOUS SHUTTLE. There is one pool and one jacuzzi for the entire hotel. The pool/jacuzzi is open from something like 8am-5pm which is utterly ridiculous. The service, from the housekeeping to the front desk, was terrible! There was no bedding for the pull out bed and we had to make repeated phone calls for about 45 minutes (seriously) to get the bedding. This happened at the end of the night when we were ready to sleep. We had to make a few other calls regarding problems with the room and went through the same thing. There is no self parking, therefore forcing you to valet your vehicle and pay every time you get it in or out. The resort fee is crazy! How is this a resort? Maybe because they give you two complimentary bottled waters and they have an expensive spa? There is a complimentary shuttle, which is actually a mini-van, that will transport you to The Wynn or the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. This \"shuttle\" runs from 9am-midnight. The line is always long and you will never know how long you will have to wait. If the shuttle fills up, you have to wait for the next one. Also, keep in mind, the Forum Shops entrance is all the way at the back of Caesars Palace and the Wynn is not on the strip either. SO ANNOYING!

It was brilliant, not cheap but sometimes you get better value paying a little more for a hotel that suits your needs , and this was the case with us. If you want a qiuet luxurious hotel away from the crowds were you feel exclusive and special this is the place.I think Mr Trump has played a blinder (as we say in England ) with this hotel. He has filled a niche here that was really neededin Vegas. Not everyone comes to Vegas to gamble and walk miles through crowds just to get to and from thier room and basic hotel amenities like the lobby pool etc. The design of this hotel makes a stay here relaxing and easy and importantly makes you feel exlusive and appreciated. He knows that the big brash and OTT Casino hotel has been done to death and he went for a different market, very clever, but I guess thats why the guy is so successful. . After a desastrous stay at the Mirage which we hated, this hotel was like a fragrant breeze in a peaceful oasis. We had a small suite with city view on the 33 floor. We liked the size of this hotel. short walks to everything , super fast lifts and very friendly staff. It was luxurious in a classy way, like the best of European hotels, stylish but not outlandish and OTT. When we arrived we were checked in quickly by a lovely friendly and proffesional young lady who would be an asset in any of the worlds top hotels and we have been lucky to have stayed in some over the years. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a little lobby shared with another room which was super peaceful and felt safe.We loved the extra space the level of decor and the great bathroom with spa tub. We had been on a long road trip and had stayed in some hotel rooms smaller than this bathroom. We liked the smaller intimate pool area, it felt exclusive and the wall and planting hid the madness of Vegas with a glimpse of the mountains, just beautiful and relaxing. All the staff were exceptional and we truly felt like VIP's during our stay. We ate the set dinner and it offered good value for money and normal size tasty portions , sorry USA but generally the portions in your restaurants are WAY TOO BIG! Only criticism of this gem of an hotel was that our bed had a pillow top that kept working loose and so our bed was not as comfortable as the one at the Mirage which was actually the only thing we liked about that hotel. About the location, I think a lot of tosh is talked about being on the strip and its convenience. It has been my expeience that even staying on the central strip you will have to do a LOT OF WALKING wherever you stay. We stayed central last time and found it very incovenient and noisy and crowded and you still have to walk. If your off strip hotel offers transport that is the perfect solution for anyone who finds trudging through crowds of people in the heat as they will take you were you want to go. This hotel was great for us as I could just walk across a qiueter street into Nordstroms and access the Fashion Show Mall and then Las vegas Boulavade.. Shuttles run to Wynn and Ceasars so is shopping is your thing then this is a great location. Would definately stay here if I return to Vegas.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "tampa,fl", "Title": "\u201cA calm oasis in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "tampaRPh", "ReviewID": "UR119993169", "Content": "We were in Vegas celebrating my parent's 50th anniversary with family.

The bus to the Wynn is never busy. Overall very good, my only two gripes would be the mattress in the room, it was past its best. I was on the 37th floor at the back of the hotel.

She happily obliged and we had the most amazing view of the strip overlooking the fashion show mall and Treasure Island. Much to our surprise we got a knock on our door about 20 minutes into our stay and were delivered a complimentary bottle of champagne from a friendly guy by the name of Rofoldo (I think I remembered it right) who gave us some great tips about what to see in Vegas as well. Almost forgot the bell boy Jeff was great as well and gave us some great tips on where to eat in Vegas. Though I didn't get names, all of the staff driving the shuttles to the Wynn & Caesars were very friendly, make sure you tip them they deserve it!! We made use of the in-room dining a few times while we were there and we could barely finish the meals because the servings were quite generous, and they tasted great too. The room itself was a corner suite on the 49th floor with a full kitchenette, fridge and spa. The bed was luxurious and the room itself was clean and well maintained. The only fault was one that we were well aware of before booking the room and that was cell phone reception is very very poor in the hotel. I read a lot of reviews about the distance from the strip. I think people are just lazy, my wife and I had no problem walking to and from the strip from the hotel and if we were drunk or tired we just caught the complimentary shuttle.

We had to walk to the Wynne about ten minutes away for this luxury. There is a regular shuttle bus there up to midnight and 2am at the weekends. There is also one to Caesars Palace and Forum Shops but this is a bit of a pain. If you want to stay on the strip without a casino and the accompanying stink of smoke, then this is the place. There is a token kitchen in the rooms and that is all it is, we could have done without it, the place seems to have been built as a condo hotel. The bathroom is big with huge glass doors that bang loudly if you are not careful (and catch your feet). There is a TV in the mirror that we had to request controls for. The kettle uses the stove and this would not work until the maintenance man came and fixed it. But a beautiful building with attentive staff and big rooms, pity about the lack of a casino. As for Las Vegas, the US is painfully behind the rest of the civilised world in that they allow smoking in most public places. A complete pain on the casino floor where people seem to light up next to you as they try to destroy their lungs - and yours if you don't get up and move away. There are filthy ashtrays everywhere - Come on America, join the rest of us and ban smoking. Therein lies the benefit of the Trump, no smoking, although when you just go in, sleep and come out you don't notice! We did not eat there and used the pool once, the view from the window was superb and we did not get sucked into the upgrade thing but still got a good room. Another nasty surprise is that here you have to pay the iniquitous Resort Fee, some hotels do not charge it and another thing that our agents forgot to mention. Why do they charge it? a Las Vegas newspaper that we did not even take in, coffee that should be available anyway, two tiny bottles of water and a pool. Check before you book as a bill for $150 after five days is a bit nasty and a fee that should not be applied to anyone - anywhere, come on Donald, get real! I suppose we should have complained about the duff stove, no TV controls and I forgot to mention, we never saw any dressing gowns as promised.

Check in was quick, the staff were excellent and the smoke free atmosphere was very welcome after our previous smoke filled experience at the Flamingo last year. We booked what we thought was a 1 bed strip view suite through Expedia and contacted the hotel in advance to request a suite away from the train tracks. The room we were given was indeed a South strip view on the 54th floor but no separate bedroom. We took this up with the hotel who claimed that the original booking was for a city view standard room and they had upgraded us to a strip view. Despite showing the Expedia receipt with strip view already paid for, we were left with a slightly larger than average hotel room with a few cooking facilities and not a one bedroom suite as booked. Expedia are looking into this but it was slightly disappointing after seeing photos of the one bed suite. The bed wasn't anything special and the pillows might as well not have been there at all but the room was clean, well looked after served it's purpose. For a 5 star property it was just OK but not a patch on most 4 stars in the Asia Pacific region or the Marriot Grand in Moscow. Location is fine, an extra few minutes walk and you're on the strip. The Wynn Casino Hotels are very close, Fashion show mall has a reasonable food court and is ideal to cut through on a hot day. Treasure Island and many of the larger hotels are also within easy walking distance. The pool is fine, great staff who will bring drinks and take food orders while you get over the jet lag and we can recommend the salads - enough for 2 people! The real downer was the noise from the trains who's drivers obviously get a kick out of sounding their claxtons from 3am onwards. These are not your average Inter-city trains either but huge rolling stock that can take a full five minutes to pass through. Despite being on the 54th floor we could hear them loud and clear! The breakfast express buffet was just average and for the only time during our stay, we were not impressed with the staff who seemed very keen to remove plates and rush us out so that they could re-set the table. At $20 per head it wasn't great value compared to most of the l breakfast buffets at any of the nearby hotels. We used Harrahs and the Rialto at around $12 each and were really spoiled for choice. Try the Rio hotel for a very lavish dinner buffet at around $25.

I really want to rate this hotel 5 stars, but a couple of things really bothered me. I booked my hotel room through priceline, but I don't think that just because I did that, I deserve less than a 5-star service. In this economy, I know I'd find the best deal there is! I called the hotel a couple of days before our arrival and explained to them that I would be sharing my room with a friend. The reception explained to me that we would have to call priceline to have them fax the name of the other guest. No problem. Priceline told me it was done. I arrive hours later than my friend, and the first thing she asked me is why she wasn't able to check-in smoothly without any hassle as the hotel promised that as long as there was a fax from priceline of the 2nd guest's name it wouldn't be a problem. Long story short, my friend was given the run around, stating that they did not receive the fax so she had to call priceline again. It turns out they had the fax confirmation from priceline after all!!! Needless to say, I called for the manager and complained. I spoke to a Caroline (or was it Catherine) and explained the situation. She said that because of our inconvenience, she would comped us the resort fees ($50 for both of us). It's a nice gesture, but not to be ungrateful, I would've rather that this never happened in the first place. Guess what? Came time to check out and the front desk told us there was no note from the manager that we shouldn't be charged for the resort fee!!! Are you kidding me??? Here we go again, telling them our story. They said they are willing to comped us for ONE, but not both!!! You don't know me, but I don't back out that quickly when I know I'm right! I asked for the manager Caroline/Catherine and of course, she's conveniently not there. By this time, they could probably tell I am ready for a fight and finally they said it's ok. It had better be ok!!! In short, other than one nightmarish experience, the Trump is a really great place to stay especially for NON-SMOKERS! It's so nice to come \"home\" to a place that doesn't smell like ashtray, ugh! Plus, I like to gamble and the fact that they don't have gambling, it was nice not to be \"tempted\" 24/7. :-) I would like to add though that the doormen and valet guys there are the best!!! I wish I could remember their names, but all of them were really nice and treated us like the princesses that we are, ha! ha! Anyway, I'm planning on going back to Vegas for my \"special\" birthday next July and even with that one major complaint, I am actually considering going back to the Trump. I just hope that the GM makes sure to let his staff know that us priceline or any other travel site buyers deserve just as much respect as the ones who book their rooms directly with the hotel. BTW, there is another \"very minor\" thing that all of my friends and I noticed from all the 4 rooms. There is a bit of a \"funky\" smell that we can't figure out. I asked one of the workers there and he said it was \"probably\" the cleansers they use. Hmmm...

We arrived and were offered a one bedroom suite for an extra $50 per night and were so glad we took up the offer! We were blown away when we entered our suite! It was on the 58th floor, huge, lovely and bright with floor to ceiling windows all the way round! Our lounge had views of the mountains and city and our bedroom and bathroom had fantastic strip views. We had two bathrooms, one with a shower and toilet and the other with a two person jacuzzi tub, toilet, huge shower and double sink with large mirrors and marble floors! Fluffy towels, robes and wonderful smelling toiletries were provided! We had a fully equipped kitchen, three TV's inluding one in the bathroom mirror, CD player and just about everything you could possibly need during your stay including iron and ironing board and room safe! We just loved being in our suite at night either sitting in the jacuzzi tub looking out at the fantastic view of the strip or gazing out at the same view from our bedroom! Coffee and bottled water were provided every day along with a daily newspaper (included in the resort fee). The room was spotlessly clean and cleaned daily. I am a light sleeper and did hear the train late on a couple of occasions during our stay but it did not bother me at all and I have to say that we slept really well whilst staying there! The bed was so comfortable and everything so relaxing! The hotel is great because it doesn't have a casino and so is easy to get to your room. The reception area is lovely and always smelt great. The staff were always courteous and helpful and it was great that security always checked you were a hotel guest when you came back late at night! The gym is high tech, fully equipped, lemon water and chilled towels also provided! The swimming pool is great and sunbeds and towels provided. There are also two spa tubs! The area was never crowded whilst we were there and we enjoyed lunch and a few drinks there too! We ate an evening meal in the restaurant on two of the nights and breakfast one morning and on all occasions the food was excellent and service great! The decor of the restaurant was lovely and very intimate. I could go on and on about how wonderful this hotel is! We just loved returning to our wonderful suite every night and our friends were so envious of us. They preferred to stay in a hotel on the strip and their rooms were small and dark with a long walk through the casino to get to the lifts to their room! Staying just off the strip was not a problem to us as it is only a 5-10 minute walk to the Wynn Hotel and a courtesy shuttle is provided by the hotel to the Wynn or Caesars Palace Forum Shops although we never used it as we loved the walk in the evening! We were so sad when we checked out as our stay was really a wonderful experience for us. We cannot rate the hotel highly enough and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Vegas and we are already planning a return trip!

The Wynn is where the wedding took place and it is so big that you can easily get lost; although it is a beautiful hotel also. I loved to sit outside and watch the people and the view of the hotel was beautiful. It was all in gold with beautiful chandeliers hanging down at the entry. It was easy to find my way around the hotel and the ammenities were numerous. They had a breakfast buffet each morning from 9a-11a with plenty of food, and it was very reasonable. I loved the in-bathroom TV which was in the mirror, so I could catch the news or my favorite program while getting ready for the events which I needed to attend.

The hotel is very easy to find and doormen and front desk staff was very friendly upon my arrival. While checking in, I was offered an opportunity to upgrade my room from a city view to a strip view for an extra charge, but since this was a business trip I declined this option. Upon arriving at my room, I was very impressed. Everything was first class. King size bed, flat screen TV, a sitting area with a sofa, two chairs, and a coffee table. The room also had a little stove, microwave, and a great little fridge. The evening view was spectacular even though it was a view of the city and not the strip. I ate dinner at the hotel which was very good. They had a $29 special that included an appetizer, main course, and a dessert. The smoked salmon appetizer was excellent and the portion was so plentiful, it could have been served as the meal. After dinner, I visited the Wynn Casino which is about a 10 minute walk. I returned to my room for a good nights sleep, or so I thought. I was awoken 3 times that night, and every other night of my stay by the passing train. Even though I was on the 44th floor, the horn from the train was so loud, I might as well have been on the ground floor. I've stayed at airport hotels that are right next to runways that were insulated better than the Trump hotel. I can not believe they did not take this into consideration when designing and building the hotel. After a very long day of being on my feet all day working at the convention, I needed more than 2 to 3 hour intervals of sleep. Our company had 5 rooms in the hotel, and all of my colleagues said they were also awoken by the train. Upon checkout, when I was asked how everything was, I told him about the train and the staff member showed no concern and just said \"next time, tell us you want a room away from the train.\" Are you kidding? If the hotel is aware of a noise issue, they should make every effort to correct it or at least move their guests away from that area and not charge them extra by offering it as an \"upgrade\".

I chose this hotel because I was getting a very good price and was willing to overlook the inconvenience of being off-strip. I also thought that the courtesy shuttle to and from the Wynn and Casesars would make up for this as well. So, let's start with the good points. I loved the fact that it was a non-casino hotel and totally smoke free. It was quick and easy to get up to your room once walking through the front door. Most casinos make you walk through a long maze of a smokey casino before getting to the guest rooms. Service from everyone I encountered at the Trump was top notch and what I would expect from a Trump hotel. Lobby was very classy and the hotel smelled so nice when you walked in. Rooms were very large. We had a studio suite and I liked the fact that there was a kitchenette (stovetop, microwave, dishes, and fridge). It was a quick walk across the street into Nordstroms or via the mall parking garage right into the mall itself. The mall has lots of options for good priced food. We grabbed quick breakfasts at Starbucks or the eBar at Nordstroms. You could also walk through the mall to the strip easily. As for food, we didn't eat at the hotel but we did order room service once. It wasn't that expensive and was very quickly delivered at 1:30 am. Veggie wrap was way too salty considering it should be a healthier option. Other points to note was that I also loved the live music on evenings at the pool level and the lobby. Nice touch! So: here are the not so great things: We were told upon check in that our room was in a really noisy location and that if we wanted to upgrade to a higher floor, with a strip view, that was less noisy, it would be $25 a night. So, we decided to pay for the upgrade. The view was great, we were on the 45th floor, but that train horn was SO LOUD!! It sounded like it was right outside my room. It was infrequent, but was loud enough to wake me up out of my sleep. There is nothing that can be done about the train horn, but I think that the hotel should make every effort to keep people away from the noise without having to pay extra. I could only imagine how much more noisy it would have been had we not been facing the strip. My second complaint was that the room needed some maintenance work. The sofa and sitting chairs looked really worn out and they looked dirty. Also, the bathroom shower head needed cleaning as it was laden with water deposits/scum. Also, the same was true for part of the sink. I was surprised to see these things in this hotel, and you don't even see these things in the most basic Holiday Inn Express. My third and biggest complaint is the courtesy shuttle to the Wynn and Caesars. First of all, let me say that the drivers are excellent. They do their best given the limited resources and handle the complaining passengers in a most positive manner. Why do the passengers complain? The fact is that a 9 person shuttle it totally INSUFFICIENT for a hotel with 1232 suites, and 50 penthouse suites. Most times, people were left behind to wait for the shuttle to return again since it got filled up with only 9 people. Also, at certain times only one of the 2 shuttles were running, alternating between the Wynn and Caesars. The worst time for getting onto a shuttle is during the evenings, especially from Caesars. Be prepared to wait...and wait. We were not able to get on a shuttle after waiting one evening at Caesars, since there were more than 9 people ahead of us. Since we were pressed for time we just decided to take a cab. It was $10 with tip and I want to say to Mr.Trump, you owe me $10. My thoughts are: If you are going to offer a service to your hotel guests, DO IT RIGHT, or don't bother at all. How hard would it be to lease/buy bigger shuttles? or get a couple more shuttles and drivers? It won't break the bank, and would keep people happy. The shuttle issues created more negative feelings with guests than anything else. Therefore, we will not be returning to Trump and will just pay the extra money and stay on strip next time.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat views of the strip!\u201d", "Author": "The_Traveller954", "ReviewID": "UR119268678", "Content": "What a room!

There were 4 of us travelling to Vegas from the UK and we had booked 2 Strip View rooms. On arrival the first thing we noticed was that it was Valet parking only, but this wasn't an issue as it was included in the resort fee, as was WiFi which was excellent seeing as last time I stayed in the Encore the resort fee was comparable but the WiFi was expensive! We were allocated 2 rooms next to each other on the 40th floor, which shared an entrance. This was perfect as we could leave the internal entrance doors unlocked whilst still being secure inside the main door. We had read the reviews on here about the sofa beds and the lack of plates etc, and sure enough our sofabeds weren't made up and there was a lack of culinary utensils etc. We rang down and within 10 minutes this was all sorted by some very friendly staff who were very apologetic. This was potentially the only thing that I could fault throughout my entire week long stay. We chose the Trump just to try something different having always stayed in Strip hotels with Casinos before. It makes a massive difference in entering and leaving the hotel literally coming out the lifts and onto the road outside - I think even given it's off strip location it's still quicker to get to the strip from the Trump than it is from a guest room in the Encore as there's no casino or shops with hoards of people to struggle through. The pool was most impressive as although it's small it gets the sun the whole day which is more than some I've been in e.g. PH. We didn't use the bar or room service etc as we'd stocked up on things from Wal Mart and having a full size fridge and cooking facilities meant we could have beer / snacks whenever we wanted and obviously being from the UK we could make the obligatory cup of tea using the kettle / hob etc! The infamous train seemed no louder here than it did from a strip view room at the Encore to me - it woke me up on 1 out of 7 nights and that was my 1st night. Speaking of sleep the bed in the room offered an amazingly comfortable sleep and the sofabed was far better than some of the reviews on here had led us to believe. I didn't use it but the person that did slept soundly every night with no complaints the next morning. Overall I was most impressed with the Trump, excellent service, lovely rooms and great location. Not having the casino I think is all down to personal preference and although I don't gamble, I do like the atmosphere and buzz of the casino hotels like the Wynn/Encore, but for practicality the lack of it certainly offers a benefit too.

Free shuttle to bellagio on the half hour stops at 11pm which is a little annoying. Amazing lobby with lots of space and nice places to sit. Non smoking which is a god send in vegas also no casino so a higher class atmosphere as a result.

Brought a 2 night stay here for the 1st time as a Expedia \"Mystery\" Hotel. Actually we already knew we are going to get Trump, coz there isn't any 5 star, smoke-free, casino-free on the North end of the strip. Location is 1/2 a block off N end of the strip, right next to the Fashion Show Mall. If you are young or fit enough, you can get take a short walk thru the mall (while enjoying the air cond and shops) to get the strip in just 5mins for a brisk walk, or 8mins for a casual walk. Free complimentary air cond shuttles are available (actually it is covered under your mandatory daily resort fee) every 15mins to & from Trump, Caesar Palace and Wynn. The last shuttle is at 12 midnight, but even a 10min walk from the LV blvd (strip) was not nearly as bad. Pros: - For a starter, your body and your clothes won't come back smoke-infused (unless you have submerged yourself in other smoky hotels for the whole day). At the lobby, you will greeted with fresh air and be free from the noise of drunk youngsters and gamblers, and from the in-famous slot machines. - Checkout is easy and fast. They call your room the day before to remind you the 3 ways to checkout: front desk, by phone or by TV. We checked out via TV. Took less than a minute. - Energy saving: they replace almost all spot & flood light with CFL, which I don't mind for the sake of conserving for the planet and becoz they use warm colored CFL (not cool white thanks god) without making you look like a ghost. Just press the Home Service button on daily before you leave, the maid will service the room. - Our room is a Basic room on the 50th floor. Not sure if Trump has changed their doors, but we hadn't experienced any noise from our neighbor closing the doors. - Clean room. Comfy bed. Even basic rooms are well equipped. Floor to ceiling window, built-in stove, microwave, mini sink, fridge (great for biz trip & family. Just heat up a hot breakfast in the morning on the go; call room service to get utensils and coffee pot for free), coffee maker, daily refill coffee, tea & 2 bottled waters for free, bathrobes, jacuzzi, walkin shower, builtin tv washroom mirror, reasonably large rm LCD, vanity mirror, hair dryer, shutout light blinds, spacious washroom. The toilet is partially enclosed off so any particular smell won't be spread to the rest of the washroom. Cons: - An expensive stay, even at discount. - Contemporary d\u00e9cor & interior design. Expecting a 5 star hotel basic room to be have impressive decors & interior design. Not a single interior design element in the entire hotel is extraordinary IMHO. But would say their design is shooting for a clean, elegant, executive, contemporary look as supposed to over the top vegas extravaganza. - Not a big property compared to other hotels on the strip. Relatively small pool by Vegas standard. \"Restaurants\" in the lobby area are pretty much for people watching (or for ppl watching you eating your food). - Check in: don't know if it was Expedia's or Trump's fault. For some reasons they had our booking reference # but not our names on file, which caused kink in the ID verification at checkin. Ended up waiting for 20mins until they sorted out the deal and apologized again for our inconvenience. But overall I would say their front desk staff are polite, friendly and representable. - Weak shower pressure even on the 50th floor. Water was not HOT HOT at max setting but good enough to generate ample steam. May be it is 1 of their ways to preserve and be cost-effective. - Weakness in maintenance: given the young age of the hotel, it has already started to show some signs of premature wear & tear. Trump will not be too pleased. The shower temp control had pieces falling off. The showerhead was broken for other pressure settings. Broken light bulb in the vanity mirror had not been replaced. Toilet cover was loosen. We had to screw it back to make it stay. - Heavy glass door inside the washroom: walkin shower and the toilet are thoughtfully individually enclosed, but the doors are too heavy that it bang too hard if you don't close them carefully enough.

I had been to Vegas in this past May on business and stayed at the Palazzo. Everything about our stay was phenomenal. When booking this trip for my brother-in-law's wedding we found a great deal at Bookit.com by searching for 5 star hotels. This hotel is not worth 5 stars. The location is nice - not a far walk from shopping and close to some major casinos (i.e. Treasure Island) with free shuttle service to others (i.e. the Wynn). We rented a car and never had a problem with valet service. In fact, all of the service personnel (front desk, doormen, bell hops, etc.) were first class. But that's where it ended. We had booked adjacent suites for our stay, which included a kitchenette. The suites were joined by a private \"foyer\" - which for us was nice because my mother-in-law stayed in the adjoining room - but I think would be very strange if you shared this with someone you didn't know. The rooms were very small and although the view was nice, it didn't say \"5 star\" to me. Everything was dingy looking - table tops were marred with scrapes and cup rings, dust collected on top of shelves and in corners and the furniture looked old and worn out. The tv in the bathroom mirror didn't work when we arrived - it was fixed a few hours later with a call to the front desk. We stayed for 5 nights and our tv quit working on the last day, as well as the jets in the jacuzzi tub (which was the only thing that I enjoyed in the room). The microwave and mini fridge were of suitable size, but there was 3 of us in our room and we only had silverware for one. Service for four would have been more expected. The coffee maker was fast but only brewed one cup at a time so I had to request several extra packets of coffee (which the housekeeping staff complied with). The drapes were missing a pull rod which made them a pain to close at night, and the sound of the train was very distracting. The air conditioning (a must in Vegas!) did not seem to cool the room down until the end of the 2nd day.

There were robes in the closet, and everything was top notch. Well, went back this weekend and things have gone downhill. No robes, even though their literature states that they are in the room, in the kitchen there were hardly any utensils, we had two forks, one butter knife, and one spoon which we discovered when we brought gelato back to snack on late one night. We had to share the spoon. We had one salad plate and one dinner plate, thank goodness we didn't plan on having anyone over or to eat anything in the room. We called down to housekeeping and asked for extra pillows, they came with no pillowcases. We had to chase down the guy and he then brought us the cases. There was a nice holder next to the phone for paper and pen, it was empty. Never did get filled. We had washcloths the 1st day then they took them and didn't replace them the 2nd day, we never did get any again. Bizarre. No napkins with the coffee fixings, which made the washcloth deficit even more noticeable as we could have at least used them as napkins in a pinch. The concierge couldn't have seemed more bothered when I stopped by to tell her that things just weren't up to snuff in our room. She said \"So, what? Do you want some robes?\" Then she asked if I wanted to have the day manager call me. I told her that I was leaving for the morning but he could call me in the afternoon. Guess who never called?

But it wasnt 100% all positive, so heres the lowdown..... Pros.- Loved the fact the hotel did NOT have a casino, and it didnt cater to the party crowd. For vegas, it was very quiet. Room was spectacular, we upgraded to a strip view for $25 and it was worth it. We looked right over the strip on the 48th floor. Wow factor for sure! The pool was fantastic (for me at least) We have stayed at several hotels in Vegas and one of my pet peeves is the constant blaring of music. I wish hotels would actually pay attention and see that most people either have their own music they listen to on ipods and such, or they have a book or magazine and want some down time at the pool....not a party atmosphere. The trump pool was understated, but the music was bearable and pool staff was outstanding. The shuttle was also fantastic, it was quick and easy, and took you to Caesars in about 5 minutes. The Luxor end of the strip wasnt as easy to get to, but one day we took the shuttle to Caesars and just grabbed a cab from there and headed to the opposite end of the strip. The trump is an easy walk to the Wynn or the Venetian, I thought it would be further off the strip, but it wasnt too bad at all. Any staff member I dealt with during my three day stay was truly outstanding and friendly, cudos to all the staff! The cons- My biggest con, was the housekeeping (surprisingly!!) I thought for a five star hotel, a couple things were just unacceptable. When we checked in, I discovered the sofa bed wasnt made. This was no problem, as I understand it may or may not be used. But it took two separate calls to get it made. After the first call I was told they would send someone right up, but 3 hours later I had to call back and make a second request. Not a big deal really, but just one instance. Worse was the second day we were there, we had no housekeeping at all! We went out in the morning and came back around 1 to discover housekeeping hadnt been to our room yet. Not an issue however, so we stayed in the room for a couple hours and went out for the evening around 3 or 4. When we came back to the room at the end of the evening we were suprised to see housekeeping never did come to our room. The next day we went out in the morning again, and came back around 1 again, still to discover no housekeeping. By this time we had been checked in for 48 hours without a single visit from housekeeping. We had no clean towels and had run out of water and coffee etc. I called down again and let them know we hadnt had housekeeping for 48 hours and could they please come to our room. We left for the evening and by the time we came back it had been done. In my opinion, for a 5 star hotel this is most unacceptable. I understand mistakes happen and I hope this was just an isolated incident and if we visited the hotel again, this would not be the case. The only other thing was the shower flooded after 2 mintues of taking a shower. By then end of my shower, I would be ankle deep in water. All in all, I would stay here again if the price was right.

The hotel has good points and bad points, but more good than bad. First, if you are going to this hotel, you have to realize that there is no casino, which is unusual for Vegas since there are slot machines in the airport. You also have to realize that this hotel is not on the strip....it's about a block back. Now, this could be something you are looking for if you want to get away from the craziness that is the strip but if you like being right there in the heart of the action, then this hotel may not be what you're looking for. This is just a hotel, no bells and whistles like the other Vegas hotels, no casino, no shows, no fountains, no volcanoes erupting, but also none of the hustle and crowds either. And it's smoke-free. Plus, no \"porn\" vendors outside the hotel either. On the strip, you can't spit without hitting one of these sleaze-peddlers. Trump offers you solace from that. However, don't despair, the hotel has shuttle buses that will take you right to Caesar's Palace and the Wynn, so you are only moments away. If you don't want to wait for the shuttle, the strip is only a 2 or 3 minute walk away. The hotel itself is beautiful. Marble floors, brass (gold) light fixtures, the woodwork around the walls and in the elevator reminded me of the boardroom on The Apprentice. The pool was great with lots of seats, warm water, clean towels, a bar nearby. This hotel also has a wonderful aroma. I have no idea what flowery smell it is but I have never commented on how a hotel smells unless it's bad. But this smell was great. It greets you immediately as you enter the lobby. At check-in, we were also offered the chance to upgrade our room for $50 more a night, which we declined. Quite frankly, it really didn't matter because the room we did get was one of the largest and best laid out hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. We were a bit confused as we approached our room when we saw two room numbers on one door (are we sharing a room with someone?). However, the first simply opens to an entryway. The two separate room doors were on the inside. Quick note here......your room has a doorbell!! Seriously. The bathroom I can only describe as huge. Standing in the door, the tub was on our left and was big enough for my girlfriend and myself to both fit in. A double sink on the far wall with a giant mirror, featuring a TV in the mirror. Several nights, we \"bubbled\" in the tub with the water jets going and watched TV. To the right behind glass doors was the shower....a shower big enough for both of us to walk around in. The toilet was also behind another glass door. Out in the room, we had a nice view of the Rio hotel and we could see the Mirage off to the left. However, right down below us we could also see Industrial Blvd featuring the Love Boutique. I won't comment on that......you can fill in your own blanks. King size bed was fantastic, plenty of closet space, counter space, we even had a stove, sink, refridgerator, utensils, in case we felt like cooking anything (we didn't). In front of the large window on the far wall was a couch which opened into another bed. Desk space was great and we had free internet (well, not really free....Trump hits you with something called a \"resort fee\" for $19.95 a day. Your internet is included in that fee). We did not eat in the DJT restaurant in the hotel, as it seemed a bit pricey. Now for some bad things, one other reviewer mentioned a train whistle. I would second that notion. We could see the train tracks from our room and a train did come by a couple times a day and was loud. 19th floor and we could hear it. However, growing up in a big city, I'm used to trains so it didn't bother me. Just be aware, you WILL hear the train. The earliest it came through was about 8am, the latest was about 11:30pm. We moved one of the chairs in the room and found a stain under the chair. Again, really didn't care.....I wasn't planning on eating off the floor anyway and afterall it was under a chair. However one point did bother me.....emphasis on the word \"point\". I was standing at the window one morning looking out over Vegas and I stepped on a carpet nail that was poking up through the rug. It did draw blood. Trump might want to get that fixed. I also noticed another carpet nail poking up near the entrance to the bathroom. So, be careful if you're walking around in bare feet. With that aside, I would still say this was one of the better hotels I have ever stayed in. I would highly recommend it and would certainly stay there again.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "cat0407", "ReviewID": "UR118756438", "Content": "Loved it, loved it all...We walked into Trump International after a hetic trip across the USA and fell in love instantly with this hotel and we were only in the lobby...We were invited to upgrade for only another $50 dollars a night which we accepted and our king room turned into a master king room..When we entered our room, I was laughing hysterically as I have never ever had a room as luxourious as this one nor have I ever had a view as beautiful as the one I had....My partner was blown away even though he did tell me to stop with the laughter but I couldn't...We had a large lounge area, kitcnenette, two bathrooms with the master bathroom bigger than places I have stayed in previously and the bedroom and bed were bliss....

We brought our 8 month old to Vegas with us so I did lots of research on family friendly hotels. I was surprised when Trump International came up on the list of \"Most Family Friendly Hotels\". When we checked in we were automatically upgraded to a strip view (we originally booked a studio suite with a city view). I asked how much it would be to upgrade to a 1 bedroom and they said $50 a night. A little more than we wanted to spend but we decided to take the upgrade anyway...and I sure am glad we did! The room was HUGE! The bathroom was as big as my bedroom at home! Everything was just so clean and immaculate. It was so nice having a kitchen available to warm up our baby's food and make his bottles. Also, we requested to have a crib in the room and it came up not even 10 minutes after we checked in. I was surprised by how nice the crib was and it even came with linens and a crib bumper. All this at NO charge! When I called other hotels like the Mirage and MGM, both said they charged $20 A NIGHT for crib use. At Trump, its free! As far as the location of the hotel, I read LOTS of reviews saying \"it's way to far off the strip, too long of a walk, etc.\" People must be out of shape because it's a 5 minute walk. Plus, if you don't want to walk in the heat then you can just cut right through the Fashion Show Mall (the entrance to Nordstrom is literally right across the street). We found the location no problem at all. Actually, it was kind of nice to be a little set back where it's not so crazy. We also thoroughly enjoyed the fact that this was a non-gaming hotel. It was SO nice to come back after a long day of walking around the strip and all the smokey hotels to a clean, fresh, hotel! It was great! The only (and I do mean ONLY) downfall was the pool area. It was very small and a little boring. But I also understand the fact that Trump is a different kind of hotel than say Mirage or MGM. It was a little awkward being the only family with a baby in the pool...we almost felt a little out of place for having a splashing baby. But our son still had fun and that's really all that mattered. We would DEFINITELY come back to Trump the next time we are in Vegas. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is SO welcoming and friendly!

The tub had a really nice jacuzzi!!!In the bathroom also, a part of the mirror was becoming a tv!!! We had also a nice view from the room of the city of Las Vegas. We were on the 31st floor so we could se from our room Rio Hotel and Mirage Hotel. The bad part of the story began when we were searching for our bathrobes we found a pair of dirty socks....... We call the housekeeping to tell them that, and to bring us a bathrobe (because there was only one in the room insted of two) , and they did 20-25 minutes to get to the room. The next day, we swich on the electroning sign of \"Housekeeping\", and when we came back to the room at 6pm, nobody had cleaned our room, so we had to call again Housekeeping to tell them to come. Then the hairdryer wasn't working and we had to wait another 20 minutes so somebody come to the room to bring a new one. When we came back at the room after the midnight , we find our room tidy and clean, but the bathrobes were missing and not replaced...I didn't expect that from a 5 star hotel. For our last day in Vegas, the front desk told us that we could have a free late check out at 4pm, but they didn't told us that after 12pm our key cards wouldn't work, so after our last shopping we were locked out of the room for about 20 minutes until the security come. From the other side their shuttle servise to Whynn and Cesars hotel was very good. Every 15 minutes there was a shuttle until midnight. They also have a good transportation to the airport in reasonable prices.

The difference with Trump Hotel is that complaints were dealt with in a timely manner, staff was professional in addressing the complaint, and to our surprise my husband and I were upgraded to a wonderful one bedroom suite for the remainder of our stay. Some have complained about the cost of the stay, but when you look at the fact that in every standard room there is a refrigerator, microwave, stove, toaster, whirlpool, and a small television cleverly placed in the mirror of the bathroom mirror I don't find the price unreasonable.

Internet is paid on a monthly basis and is used by employees of the hotel as well. It is a collective charge.

So it wasn't by choice that we stayed here, but it was a great stay overall. I was a little disappointed to learn that this was just a hotel and not a hotel/casino. But liked the fact that it is a smoke free facility, including the pool area (there is one small smoking section on the back patio). We checked in very late at night - around 1am, so there was no line. The clerk was courteous and friendly and remembered me when I checked out 2 days later. The lobby is exquisite, though sorta small compared to many other hotel/casinos in Vegas. They have a bar/lounge in the lobby and an adjacent restaurant. The service one of the best I've had in Vegas. Housekeeping was quick with orders for extra towels and water bottles. The doormen always had a smile and were attentive, and the shuttle drivers, were courteous and friendly (asked questions about our time in Vegas). PS - there is a free shuttle to the Wynn or to the Caesar's Forum Shops that runs very frequently throughout the day and into the night and also picks up from these locations. We stayed in a King Suite on the \"strip view\" side of the hotel. It did not disappoint. Great view of the strip including the Bellagio Fountains (though I don't think every room will have this same view). Kitchenette which includes a microwave, small stove (electric) and a fridge (bigger than a mini-fridge, but not full size). The suite also had a nice couch and two chairs along with a coffee table. Included in the suite was coffee (quick brew coffee maker) and bottled water (unlimited refills). The bed was a little firm, but I slept well. My girlfriend claimed that she didn't sleep as well, which is strange since she prefers a firmer bed than I do typically. There was a couple water spots on the ceiling in the bathroom that were questionable for a 5 Star hotel, and the toilet seat seemed to have a \"hinge\" problem, but fairly minor issues. The bathroom amenities were fantastic - large stand up shower, along with a huge spa bath, two sinks and a toilet that was partitioned off; it also included a t.v. in the mirror. The pool is great. Plenty of seating (at least in early September) on both Saturday and Sunday. It is large enough that you can actually swim laps (not quite olympic length, but long enough). There a about 10 cabanas for rent along with large round couch chairs for rent, or the free seating. The free seats are obviously first come first served, and don't come with umbrellas by default, but if available the life guards/pool attendants will bring one over for you. There is a bar and light restaurant right next to the pool. Drinks are typically overpriced, but you can order a tropical smoothie for $6-8 and add a shot of rum for $3 and have a very tasty drink. They also had a \"bucket of beers\" special - so ask. We didn't use the spa or the gym, but they looked nice. As stated in the beginning of this review, we booked this hotel via an \"unpublished rate\" deal, so we got the room at a discount. I would say that it was worth what we paid and generally speaking, this hotel is worth it if you are looking for a place where you can get first class service and a nice place to stay. As well, it's not so far off the strip and is right next to the fashion show mall (the entrance to Nordstrom is right across the street from the hotel).", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Strongsville, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "messersa", "ReviewID": "UR118009835", "Content": "The staff at the Trump hotel Las Vegas could not have been more accommodating.

If you do not want people to book at a promotional rate, then do not offer it! If you do offer a promotion, then one should get the same experience as someone else booking at a higher rate. I have been to Las Vegas many times and decided to give the Trump a chance, even after reading about there being no casino and located a couple blocks off-strip. There were three of us traveling together and the reservation indicated this. Check in was fairly smooth. I had asked for a higher floor away from the side the train was on, based on several reviews, but was told I was already assigned a room on the 18th floor, but it was pool side (away from the train.) I was concerned to find our room was right off the elevators, and indeed the elevator noise was problematic when trying to sleep. Also, if you want to nap during the day, the pool noise is horrendous. Upon getting inside, we discovered our room had only one plate and two coffee mugs, two forks, knives, spoons, one sauce pan and not much else in the way of kitchen supplies (they boast a full kitchen/kitchenette depending on the room, supposedly with all necessary items and since we booked for three, you'd think they would stock the kitchen for three!). The sofa bed was not made up, nor were there any sheets in the room to make up the bed our selves (again, with three people, the sofa bed was going to be used!). So the first call down was to the front desk to get the bed made up and the necessary kitchen items. Then we realized the suit case stand was broken and would not stand, nor were there any robes in the room, as advertised. So I called again to get a replacement stand and the robes sent up. Also the $20 per day resort fee supposedly included bottled water but of course, there was no bottled water in the room so we called again (call number 3). (We got our TWO per day...great for the three of us....NOT!) When the gentleman arrived to bring us dishes, we told him there was no ironing board in the room either (basically notification #4). All of these items are clearly mentioned in the room description, but they were not in our our room for some reason. What was humerous is that there was a call from the front desk shortly after arriving and she left a message, but was clearly oblivious to the issues we were having; she was just conducting the routine post check-in courtesy call. On top of this, the room we were assigned was a handicapped room, (which we did not ask for, nor want) and the closet railings were so low my dressess dragged the bottom. I could not take a shower, as the \"adjustable\" shower head did not go higher than my chest. There were some other minor issues, like a broken handle on one of the drawers, not enough towels being left in the room on the last day, along with no floor mats or wash cloths at all the last day....etc. There was enough to know housekeeping has no attention to detail, which one would expect in this hotel. For the record, I did go to the front desk to speak to the manager, but the front desk person \"ran interference\" and I never got to speak to a manager directly, so am not even aware if anyone knows of all these issues. I do know that no one followed up with us after the numerous complaints. (I had stayed at another hotel once where there was a minor parking issue that I didn't even mention, but \"somehow\" the manager became aware, sent a personal note of apology and asked me to contact him directly if I had any other issues during my stay. Nothing remotely like this at the Trump.) It seems to be a common response to be asked to give them another opportunity to make the next visit a more memorable one, but I will not do that. I feel that I was there for three nights (I should've checked out after one, but was hoping they would redeem themselves), and given the circumstances you think they would have gone out of their way to make the remainder of our trip \"memorable\", but they did not, so I feel they missed the opportunity to change my mind. They did waive the resort fees, however, which was the least (literally the least) they could do.

Kitchen overall though lacked plates, dishes, utensils. Two wine glasses, two plates, a small bowl, and a teapot was all that was there. Sleeper sofa was positioned directly under the AC vent so that the draft constantly blew onto the children with no way to adjust the angle of the vents. Walking across the street to the mall is a dangerous endeavour, especially with small children since there is no streetlight only a crosswalk over about 5 fast traffic lanes. Not many dining options in the hotel: poolside bar/restaurant, Trump restaurant, and room service. Ala carte breakfast for family at Trump restaurant: about $100 w/tip, nothing special; omlette for me; bacon/eggs for wife; chocolate pancakes for kids; hot chocolate and coffee for drinks. Got room service second day because didn't want to run-for-life with 3 kids to mall across the street, about $85, not including tip. 3 12\"pizzas, buffalo wings, cheese sticks. Pizza was really good though! The pool was not really great for kids. It is mainly for adults that want to lounge, drink, read, and check out other people. I didn't feel comfortable having my kids playing in the water because there were so many people with drinks or books in hand in and around the pool that didn't want my kids disturbing. System for \"connecting\" rooms for 1 bedroom suites at the end of the hallway was a pain if you only have one of the rooms...basically you are required to go through two keycard doors to get into your room since there is an outer door to the mini-waiting room/access area that is shared by both rooms. The doorbell which is on the other side of two doors, to our room did not work. We could not hear people knocking on the outer door so we would have to coordinate with phone calls before hand if someone wanted to come to our room. Jacuzzi was very nice.

The bathroom was by far my fave thing about the hotel. I loved the jaccuzi and the giant shower, plus having a tv in the mirror was great when relaxing in the bath. It was very clean and housekeeping kept it cleaned and stocked everyday. My room was not perfect, there were some marks on the floor and walls (obviously so) and the mattress did not seem to fit the bed frame as there was an obvious gap between the end of the mattress and end of the bed head, i kept dropping things in the gap! I did like that at check in I could choose a high or low floor, I chose high due to previous reviews about train noise. When just relaxing in bed/watching tv, I head the horns clearly, when in the bath or sleeping I was not bothered by the noise at all. The bed was comfortable, I liked that the pillows on the bed were varying types so you had a choice and could find one that was comfortable. Room service was reasonably priced (I was surprised at how affordable it was!) and I liked that they came up and set the coffee table for you with tablecloth and cutlery and then came and cleaned it all up. That gave you the feel that you were in a 5 star hotel. I loved that the hotel was smoke and casino free. Its well advertised and its a bonus as far as I am concerned. As for being off the strip, it clearly depends on how far you consider 'a walk'. From the previous reviews I was half expecting to need hiking shoes! Couldn't be further from the truth. I'm not a fast walker at all, but from my room to walking out of the fashion show mall onto the strip was not even a 10min walk in air conditioned comfort. I also took the shuttle to the Wynn on one occassion. In August heat you would have to be very brave to walk the entire length of the strip, I highly reccomend getting the 'Duece' bus ($7 for 24hour ticket), which has frequent stops along both sides of the strip at the majority of hotels. Factor this in and the very short walk, or shuttle to the Wynn and the location slightly off the Strip really doesn't matter! I loved not being on the strip on weekend nights due to the sheer number of people out on the strip, being loud/drunk. It was nice escaping the madness! If each room has robes without asking, and the floors/walls are cleaned up and the mattress are a better fit in the frames, this hotel would be worthy of its 5 star rating, but its the small things letting it down right now. I would not hesitate to stay here again, and have reccomended it to family/friends who are planning trips to Vegas and are concerned by being on the Strip/smoky casinos.

The Trump is a sparkling oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip -- no casino, no thumping clubs, no cigarette smoke, and the pool is never too crowded. This means the hotel is relaxing if you're having a romantic weekend and also feels safe when you're traveling alone on business as a woman. The rooms are fantastic - they are all suites/condos and even the \"cheapest\" room is very spacious with a huge bathroom and ample closet and living space for two. Though you might find some odd things about the room, like a missing safe or no glasses for water or no hangers, housekeeping is incredibly helpful with bringing anything you'd need. (You also get daily water bottles and decent toiletries, which are pluses.) If you really want to party in Vegas, you may be disappointed since there is no club and the pool is rather quiet with families and couples. You can walk to the Wynn and the Fashion Show Mall, but it's a bit of a hike to the main hotels on the Strip or the closest monorail stop. Even in August, we walked quite a bit--it's definitely possible--but you'll probably want to take taxis to your destinations. The hotel has a shuttle to both the Wynn and Caesar's Palace, and if you walk THROUGH the mall, you can get to the middle of the Strip fairly quickly. I'd definitely stay at the Trump again, especially if I can get the amazing rate I got for work. It'd be fun to stay on the Strip, sure, but if you're looking for a hotel that's a little less overwhelming, the Trump is the way to go.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic facilities and suite\u201d", "Author": "VickyandZak", "ReviewID": "UR117530792", "Content": "Room: lovely suite, kitchen area with basic utensils, cooker, microwave and large fridge, living area with TV, sofas, bathroom with shower and toilet.

The reviews on TA are right on about the TRAIN noise. It is no joke. We were \" upgraded\" when we checked in and stayed in a 1 bed studio room facing the strip. It was suppose to be on the quieter side of the hotel but trust me - the train noise will wake you up at night. I am usually a heavy sleeper and don't mind hall noise etc but if you are a light sleeper do not stay here! Other things that the hotel was lacking: The room was not as clean as it should have been. The bathroom particularly had signs of mold and \"pink orange\" water scum in all the corners. The carpet was worn and heavily stained ( please get some Resolve on this!) The furnishings ( ie night table had watermarks scratches from glasses being set down etc) were beat up looking. Bath robes were not in the room when we looked and so I called downstairs so someone could bring them up- Front desk reception was like \" Did you look in the closet?!\" I wanted to honestly say \" Are you kidding me?!\" Of course I looked I am not a complete idiot! Overall service from front desk was really average. If the concierge was out no one could really give a meal recommendation. Frederic from the concierge was GREAT! They need to pay him more- he was the only one who truly professional and courteous. Overall, first glance of the room is nice but not until you actually use the room like the shower which made me wish I brought shower shoes. The train noise is significant. The pool was nice and relaxing and those poolside waitresses are working hard in all that heat. I would probably never stay here again.

We ate in the restaurant one night during our 4 day stay - both the food and the service was excellent (the wine a little more than we are used to paying in the UK). The pool area was wonderful - and it was nice to see it lifeguarded at all times during our stay. We used the pool bar area both for drinks and food and we were very pleased with the facilities. We loved the hotel so much we decided to go back for our final night of our holidays after travelling the West Coast - we couldn't wait to go back.

The room was the best my wife and I have ever had in Vegas. If you are looking for a place that is quick to check in, offers immaculate accomodations, and above-and-beyond customer service, this is your place. The Trump in any other city would be a bar-none hit. Its biggest negative would be a tie between: 1, being a non-gaming facility and, 2, being slightly off the Strip. The latter is a minor concern because you will walk much more along LV Blvd in general than from the Wynn to Trump. All rooms are (at-least) efficiency suites. You can save money by staying here and keeping snacks in the room. It's best to be at the Trump and either rent a car, or take a cab to outlying areas. Yes, it is walkable from The Strip, but be prepared for about a 10-15 minute walk away from other people. If you are safety first, this may be a negative. Regardless, the Trump is an excellent property: coffee in the room, immaculate accomodations, and excellent customer service. It is best for business travelers, as well as those who may consider retiring early for the evening...at least according to Vegas standards. :-) BTW...the people complaining about trains are light sleepers.

Upon arrival, we noticed that our vehicle has to be vallet only and no self parking. So we had to tip the driver when we leave AND come back to the hotel. When we checked in, we were not greeted. Front desk lady wasn't cheerful but looked sad. After driving for almost 6 hours, would be nice to be greeted with a smiling face in stead of a sad depressed face. She offered for an upgrade but we refused. We went to check the room, didn't like the view so we decided to go back downstairs and upgrade to a one bedroom suite. Got the same lady to help us, still no personality! Room were absolutely gorgous, no complaint. We had to pay for a daily resort fee for the stay. Resort fee? Pool is as simple as can be, just because there were palm trees, I don't think a resort fee should be charged. It's not even closed to look like a resort let alone the server just walk around the pool and did not greet or ask any guest if we would like to order anything. Hotel has no casino, only one shop and the restaurant not even 5 star. It is more like a lounge. Pool closed at 8 pm. Don't understand why it closes so early when there isn't anything else to do in this hotel. When we had to leave the hotel and get our car from the vallet parking, we were not greeted. Only got a Thank You when we hand them the tips. Knowing how Trump is and how wealthy and fancy he can be, would be nice if he can provide better training to staff on hospitalily, courteous and a better service. When one stays in a 5 star hotel, we should feel like we are getting a high class service as well but sadly, we didn't experience it.

On the first night, we were in a room facing the railway track and was woken up 4 times at all hours by a loud freight train blowing its horn (far more than necessarily I thought). The kind hotel management moved us to the other side of the hotel and from then on, it was the best sleep one could find in Las Vegas. Each room only has one neighbour with a shared second door so you can sleep well at night without hearing many doors slam. The rooms are well sound proofed. The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in (better than the Wynn and Encore beds, which used to be my choice as best). So a great bed and silence...best sleep you will find in Las Vegas. The bathroom is the best too- with a spa bath! (better than the bathroom I had in the suite in Ceasar's Palace, which used to be my top choice). Add to this a kitchen- no hotel in Las Vegas can beat this. The management always responded immediately to any request and were always most helpful. We had dinner once at the hotel restaurant- the alcohol was a bit pricey but again, it was the best meal I have had in Las Vegas and the bill for two (with quite a lot of alcohol) came to about $130 which is good if the food is good and it was!

Check in folks were nice, and though we never saw the maids, they did a nice job cleaning and did not forget to bring us water and new coffee every day. We used the shuttle to Caesar's and it worked great! We loved that there wasn't a casino because it made for a very relaxing atmosphere overall, and there was no smoky smell. Our room was absolutely wonderful! It was huge, and the bathroom was amazing! We loved the jacuzzi tub so much! Also, the bed was the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel. We had a strip view on the 59th floor and it was really worth it - we could see the fountains at Bellagio! The one big drawback is the doors on the rooms. They are very heavy and they go BLAM! every time someone shuts one. You can hear every door close around you. This is bad at night, so earplugs are kind of necessary, sad to say.

We travelled to Las Vegas with my parent who also stayed at Trump and loved it as well. My dad is in a wheelchair and everything was perfect for him too. If you are looking for a Las Vegas gambling and wild experience at your hotel, don't stay at Trump Tower as it is not your typical mega-hotel on the strip which we had plenty of opportunity to experience while we were in Las Vegas. Crowded lobbies, pushy people and loud, smokey casinos are not our idea of a good time. We wanted to go somewhere that would provide nice surroundings and a good pool in a location that is accessible to the entertainment and shows that we wanted to see. Trump Tower is a non-smoking hotel (not just the rooms, but everywhere - even the bar area). Every other hotel that we visited (Wynn, Treasure Island, Luxor, MGM, Bellagio, etc.) all had a strong odour of cigarettes in their lobbies. Generally, the air was not smokey (due to the high volume of air exchange) but never the less, the places were permeated with cigarette smoke which is less than desireable for non-smokers like ourselves. I have to say that the room at Trump was one of the most luxuriously appointed rooms I have stayed in. Some examples: - Extremely high quality bed, bedding, pillows & linens - The nicest bathrobe I've ever seen (wanted to keep it!) - Sub-zero bar fridge, Wolf cooktop / warming plate, - Marble and glass door shower (room for two) and countertops - in-mirror television in the bathroom - Huge jetted tub, top-end faucets and hardware Given that the hotel had only been open for about a week, I was expecting some issues. While there were minor things, there was nothing that I have not had happen at any other hotel so I really can not complain (for example, my cordless phone didn't work - fixed with a call to the front desk). The pool was incredible and barely used by anyone. We spent several hours at the pool and there was never more than 10 people at the pool despite the 100 degree, sunny weather! Thankfully, the front desk staff helped us out and walked us through the check in at their computers. Staff were very helpful and polite at all times. We would not hesitate to stay at the Trump Tower again and liked the location - a two minute walk to the strip, very close to the Wynn hotel. Travel With Kids:None Yes!

Main bathroom was to die for, it was way bigger than many rooms we have had at other hotels, again all quality fittings and felt very stylish.

We walked back from main strip after shopping centre closed on a couple of nights with our 11 year old and found the streets to be well lit and we never felt unsafe at any time, we did not use the free shuttle as we found the walk to the main street was only 5 minutes anyway. No hotels either side of Trump which makes it look a bit isolated. Loved the pool area, not over crowded and very large pool with plenty of lounges while we were there.

Regular travellers to Vegas have told us that the cost of food and entertainment has went up a lot in the last few years but if you look about you can find cheap food, especially for meat eaters (we are fish eating couple) we resorted to finding an out of town supermarket where we stocked up on fruit, veg and yoghurt along with pasta and fresh juices, eggs and bread. this did us for the majority of our trip although we still ate out a few times, once at China Town, once at a noodles bar in Ceasars palace both of which were nice.

A very decent size room with very comfortable bed and a lovely sofa which we turned round to face out onto the amazing Strip view. The pool as someone has said already, was a bit small in comparison to other hotels and could be considered fairly bland. However, it was always spotlessly clean and there was never a problem with getting a sun bed or parasol. As far as we were concerned, it was all we really needed but may have been a let down for the pool party brigade. Reception was small, but again spotless, and very \"gold\", in true Trump style. So what could be the blemish on this fine establishment ?? Sadly it seems to lack atmosphere of any kind at all, especially during the evening. There is one shop, ( Trump's own branded goods ), one bar which is in the lobby and from what we saw was very rarely used. We so much wanted to return each night to a hotel where we could sit in our hotel bar with a couple of night caps, but I think they must have given the feng shui guy the day off when they plumped the bar in the lobby. It also had only one restaurant, which to be fair was excellent. But that was it, DT's Signature Restaurant, take it or leave it. The irony is, old Donald seems to have thrown the towel in a little by acknowledging this. Shuttles are regular to The Wynn and to Planet Hollywood. On the face of it, these courtesy trips may seem just a little added extra laid on by the Hotel. To me they were a sad admission that there wasn't enough entertainment on site, the alternative being to ferry the Hotel guests to it's competitors. You didn't after all see any of the other hotels laying on shuttles to the Trump ! We did in fact spend a few nights in the nearby Wynn making use of their facilities, but I couldn't help thinking that the Trump organisation would have much preferred me to have been spending my dollars with them instead. Opportunity missed I'm afraid ! The lack of a Casino was neither here nor there for us. I just wished though that whoever had planned this Hotel had some ideas to keep their guests on site with at least something entertaining going on during the evening. Even a cosy, secluded, but very upmarket Bar area would have done. Having said all that, we booked the Hotel for the value it presented, even allowing for the $20 per day Resort Fee. For us it was the spotless and fabulously appointed Room, the accommodating pool, the Trump brand, and the staff who were as excellent as we expected. Will we go back ?......................in a heartbeat ! , and that's why the Hotel still deserves 5 stars.

We arrived in the early evening and the check-in process was quick and easy. I had read other reviews that talked about the nearby train that goes by so I asked if that was really a problem. The desk clerk acknowledged that some people are bothered by the train but she assured me that that our room would \"be away from all that\". Ultimately, we were given Room 2308 and while it may have been farther from the train than other rooms, you could definitely still hear it. Furthermore, the room was above the pool and because it was not that high up, the pool music could be heard quite clearly. While this was not a problem in the afternoon or evening, it was pretty annoying in the morning at 8:00 a.m. when the pool opened. After checking in, my husband and I wanted to have a glass of wine. We assumed that wine glasses would be included as part of the kitchen set-up but they weren't. In the process of looking for them though, we found a half-eaten bag of potato chips in the cabinet which concerned me as to the overall cleanliness of the room. We ended up calling the front desk for glasses and while they were gracious about bringing then, it took more than half an hour. Despite these issues, there was a lot that is good about Trump Hotel. The rooms are large and attractive with comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms. The pool has plenty of chairs and if an umbrella isn't available, one of the attendants will bring you one. We used the shuttle to Caesar's a couple times and it was pretty convenient. (The shuttle to Wynn kind of seemed like a waste since it's right up the street). We also had a car and the valet service was prompt and polite. The location is a bit of an issue unless you are already familiar with Vegas. My husband and I have been there quite a few times so we knew exactly where Trump was in relation to other hotels and how to get places efficiently using short-cuts and free trams when available. Even so, there is a lot of walking and if the mall is closed, you have to walk down a fairly isolated bit of the road for the last stretch to get to the hotel. But, given the price we paid, the location was worth it. Finally, and I would assume most people reading this would know this, but there is no casino at Trump.

Beds and linens are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Hotel was immaculate. When visiting Vegas, we were leery about staying in a hotel with no casino. But the service provided erased any skepticism we has. Check in: extremely fast. From drop off to being in my room took about 10 minutes. This is a no smoking hotel, but the idiots in the next room must have not got the message. When I made a quick call, I was immediately moved to another room. Room: This hotel was originally built as a condo complex, but was converted to a hotel. Room was spacious ( I had a one bedroom suite) with a nice wet bar fridge and microwave. Bath room was luxurious with a Jacuzzi tub, double sinks, and tv in the vanity mirror. Soaps were from the Trump spa and smell wonderful. Robe provided was very soft. Room TV was a 38\"or larger HD screen with a great picture. Location: For me I am fine with the location. Those who want an on strip may not care for the location. This hotel is at the north end a bit off the strip. They provide free shuttle service to the Wynn and Caesars palace. So you can get to just about anywhere you want to go and never move your car.

Other that was provided at no charge: Wireless internet had an extremely strong signal. Newspapers delivered every morning. Bottled water placed in room daily. Gym has top notch equipment. I only saw the pool but did not use. It looked very nice but small. Food: All food and beverage we experiences was very good a little pricey, but not over the top. Overall: we loved the lobby that smelled clean and smoke free. Also appreciated not having to maneuver through a casino to get around the hotel. The ease of getting to a casino outside the hotel was enough for our casino needs. Only downside: There were a few of us staying at the hotel on various floors. The elevators are in banks, so to get from a floor in the 40's to a floor in the 60's you had to go down to to up.

Back to the review\u2026I booked a city view suite on Priceline two weeks prior to this trip @ $120 USD per night. At check-in (which went very fast) we were actually upgraded free of charge to a suite w/ strip view, since this was our inaugural trip to Vegas after all. The Hotel: The hotel itself is done up nicely. The lobby has a lot of gold and glitter. There\u2019s a small bar to the right and check-in directly to the left of when you walk in the main entrance. The hotel sits about 1 block (1/4 of a mile since the blocks are huge) off the strip. It\u2019 still very close the Wynn, Encore and other activities.

The shuttle drivers were great and went above and beyond their jobs to ensure we got to where we needed to go\u2026To be expected from a Trump Hotel IMHO. The rooms: The rooms are all very nice and despite the bad reviews, I absolutely loved the beds.

When you walk down the hallway toward your room, you\u2019ll notice double doors with suite numbers 4718/4719. The double doors open to the entrance door for your suite.

As this was a brief work trip there were functions and services at the hotel I did not use but . . . I did see enough of this property and have stayed at other LV hotels beyond count to offer a good review / comparison. As always, I am breaking down my review to the Great, Good, Bad, and Ugly with some bottom line type comments. Ready? Here goes . . . GREAT * Space: Regardless of where you are at this hotel - hallways, your room, lobby, etc. - you will feel abundant personal space. This is especially true in the beautiful hotel lobby (see pic), even though it has an ironically small footprint for an upper-tier Vegas property. If you don't know what I'm talking about, take a walk through the NY NY or Ceasar's which are jam-packed with noisy humanity. I really liked the spacious 'feel' of the Trump. * Casino-less: Some will see this as a DETRACTION but I think it is great to have a relatively central upper-tier hotel option in Vegas that does not force you to take a 5K walk through a small city sized casino. The 'bing bing bing' sound can be a little mind-numbing after a few days. Trump is a nice respite. It's great to just walk out of an elevator and across the lobby to the entrance / exit. And, you won't be confronted by the sight of the nickel slot 'playing for rent' crowd. GOOD * Room Size / Design: I stayed at the entry-level room and I found it to be extremely impressive for what I paid for it. The room I stayed in held it's own with other teir one Vegas properties. It even included some things standard rooms in many nicer Vegas properties do not: a small kitcheonette and a very neat in-mirror bathroom tv screen. The room itself had that 'everything is new' feel. * Temperature control / quietness: I loved the room's built in temp control system - just enter your desired temp and the system does the rest. I thought the room was far more quiet than the typical hotel room - why? In almost ALL hotels you walk out of your room and you are in a big corridor. At the Trump, your door will empty into a small 'alcove' that will contain your door and only a few neighboring doors - from there, you have to open the alcove door to get into the main hallway. For me, this really seemed to cut down on hallway noise. However . . . end up with the wrong neighbor and it could probably INCREASE the background noise you'll have to hear. This 'alcove' concept would also seem to pose a security threat as it would seem easier for some predator to jump someone out of the view of a long hallway - so some good / some bad here. * Property: While your Vegas fun will be had elsewhere, just because there is no casino does not mean you can't hang at the Trump. There appears to be a nice spa and pool area - and a very relaxing lounge in the lobby (lounge entertainment does not appear to be an option though - of course this can be a good thing too). BAD (Room for Improvement) * Mobility: I will not go as far as to say a car is a NECESSITY at the Trump but if you don't have one you'll be feeling it a little more than many other Vegas properties. Even Mandalay at the very end of the strip is co-joined with a few other hotels via train. You can of course walk to the fashion show plaza which will put you on the strip but, unless you bring adequate taxi budget, you'll wish you had a car. * Pool Closing Time: I understand why all of the other Vegas properties with casinos close their swimming pools early but . . . I'm not sure why the Trump does. Bottom Line * In a comparison with other vegas properties the Trump is upscale and spacious. If you are willing to part with a casino at the hotel you stay in, this elegence can be had for a very competitive price that will check in about the same with far lesser properties like The Riviera or Circus Circus (anyone else afraid of clowns?). * View the Trump as an ideal Vegas HQ but . . . your fun will likely have to be had somewhere else.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel just off the strip\u201d", "Author": "SujoyMumbai", "ReviewID": "UR115828635", "Content": "Visited Vegas with Family in May 2011.

I faced north so had an amazing view out over the mountains so don't worry if you can't pay the pricier Strip view! The train was only noisy because it insisted on blasting its horn for a few seconds as it came along by the hotel, this only happened a few times but once I realised what it was, I slept through it anyway. Although there is the short walk from the Strip to the entrance of the hotel, it is then only a few seconds across the lobby to reach the lifts for the rooms. So this compares well with the other hotels that although are on the Strip their entrance is set back from the actual road and once inside you have to wander through the smoky casinos en route, eventually, to the lifts. So compared to that, it actually compares pretty favourably! It's bliss that it's no smoking and especially round the pool, nothing worse than smoke wafting over you! My only slight gripe about the whole place is the music at the pool. At 8am on a Monday (jet lag!) I really could've done without pounding rock music. Everyone has an ipod now, so why do we have to listen to music that is not of our own choice or heaven forbid, listen to nothing at all if we choose to? I thought the Trump touch may be rather OTT in the room decor but I have to say that compared to a few other hotels the lovely wood finish with neutrals was a sure winner...not a sign of over the top gold in site!

In this case it is relevant for a 5 stars high class experience. Having been multiple times to Vegas and stayed at a number of different hotels there I can without doubt say that this is where I have gotten the most bang for the buck. The building was first built with the thought in mind that it should be sold as apartments. The timing was not perfect when it stood finished in the very beginning of the financial crisis. It was there for decided to create a hotel instead. As a result, all the rooms are quite large, have a fully working kitchen and a more apartment feel to it than a regular hotel room. Service was personal, prompt and precise. I had some smaller issues with my room and this was immediately handled and addressed in a very professional manner by the management in the reception. Some people complaint about the hotel not being on the strip. For me, the 5 minutes to walk to the strip really don\u2019t make a difference. There is also a shuttle-bus to Wynn and Caesars and the Fashion Show Mall (huge shopping center and food court) is located right across the street. I also enjoyed the pool and the service there. There is a HUGE selection of fancy and different hotels in Vegas. The Wynn or Encore might be more luxurious, but way more expensive. I would argue that Trump is more up-scale and up-to-date than both Paris, Venetian and Bellagio and way cheaper. It makes Treasure Island look like something from the 70\u2019s and even if I love Caesars to bits I found that I was able to relax more at the Trump \u2013 at a much lower price. The Trump will definitely be my top pick the next time I visit Vegas \u2013 If they don\u2019t increase the prices too much and by doing that position themselves to close to places like the Wynn.

The service from the bell boys, to the front desk, to the restraunt and pool staff was excellent.

Resort fee-yes, but this fee does cover wifi, pool access, newspaper, and bottled water. Lots of hotels now charge a separate fee for the pool and gym, so this wasnt too bad. My only two minor complaints?? The property was extemly clean, but for some strange reason dust seemed to accumulate everywhere throughout the day. On the cupboards, lobby, in the bathrooms, and on the counter tops. Weird I know, but other guests mentioned it too in passing. Secondly, each room shares a separate entrance way with another room.

It's not our first time in Vegas, so we were very familiar with all of the \"themed\" hotels, of which we will more than likely never stay at again. We chose Trump because it is non smoking and has no casino. Within 5 minutes either walking or on the free shuttle, you can be in a casino. it's the best of both worlds (the grown up quiet vacation one at \"home\", and the have fun and lose money while drinking one with just a short walk or shuttle ride) On a previous trip I had to wash my hair after just walking through the lobby of our hotel because of the smoke, but not at the Trump. The food in the restaraunt was incredible (and enough for 2 meals), and when we wanted a cheaper more fast food option, we just walked across the street to the Fashion Mall which had endless food options, and was open very late. The service is unbelievably joyous - from the check in, to the pool attendants, to the shuttle driver who seriously made our shuttle rides some of the most fun times we had. He was full of information, and like every employee, was so eager to help. Thank you to this incredible place for such a marvelous stay. We will definately be back, and I have already recommdended the Trump to several friends who will be visiting Vegas soon. P.S. Someone else mentioned the addictive smell of the hotel in their review, and I would have to agree. I'm not sure how the \"air\" can possibly smell so good as it's not a perfumey smell, but it does.

Nevertheless, you won't be bombarded with the sound of slot machines or the smell of unsuccessfully covered-up smoke because the Trump is a casino-free hotel. I've stayed at the Venetian, Nugget, and Mirage on my trips to Vegas, and this ranks right up there with the Venetian in my point of view. The room and the hotel don't have the benefit of an theme or kitchy furnishings, but it is modern and luxurious, with a wonderful bathroom. The tub was an ultra-deep jacuzzi affair that worked wonders on my tired back and feet. The staff was super friendly and the cleaning staff was competent. I received a special rate through Book-It, as a mystery property hotel-79.99 (plus 19.95/day resort fee). When I asked for an upgrade to a strip view room due to other Trip Advisor reviews mentioning loud trains on the mountain view side, I received the upgrade free of charge. Despite this, I did hear a train pass through one early morning, but it hardly bothered me. The view from our window was amazing and the walk to the strip was very short. You can be at the Wynn within 10 minutes, or walk across the street to Nordstrom at the Fashion Show mall and take advantage of an air-conditioned stroll to get to the strip. Parking is valet only, with no set charge. I tipped $5.

The shuttles do run until 11:00 during the week but if you're seeing a show or staying out late then I recommend taking a cab. I loved the no smoking and no casino onsite.

It was the second time I've stayed there, and it didn't disappoint. In fact, compared to my previous stay, I saw several improvements. That's not to say I had a lot of problems during my previous visit, just that some of the attention to detail had improved. During this visit, I don't recall hearing the train at all. When some family members staying at a different hotel came to visit, they commented on how quiet it was in the room. I never heard anyone in the hallways; the only time I heard other guests was if the \"neighbors\" sharing our doorway went into or left their room. The doors are quite heavy, and they make some noise, but the heaviness of the doors makes me feel secure, so it doesn't bother me. And I really like the in-room control that allows you to alert the housekeeping staff about whether or not you want to be disturbed. It's a high tech way of eliminating those door cards that always seem to fall off or be turned the wrong way. As a woman travelling alone (girls week with my sisters), I always feel safe and secure at the Trump Hotel. I never waited more than five minutes for my car (valet only), even over a busy weekend when they had several weddings at the hotel. The door staff makes me feel like royalty, always holding the door and opening my car door upon arrival and departure. They always asked if I needed directions or assistance in any way. And the inside staff always checks for a room key before allowing anyone to get to the elevators. One evening, I was going to the business center to print a boarding pass for my sister. I couldn't get any access, so I went to the bell staff desk since there were a few people in line at the check-in counter. They said they were having a problem with a power outage to parts of the hotel. I would have had no idea there was a power outage if I hadn't tried to use the computer (it worked fine all the other times I used it). The generator apparently didn't cover the business center. In any event, the bell desk personnel simply printed my sister's boarding pass for me, even asking if I wanted to make the seat selection by coming around the counter. Most places would say \"come back later\", but they never hesitated to assist. The concierge desk was similarly outstanding in their efforts to assist. When I gave them a sketchy description of a Korean restaurant I heard someone talk about, the attendant immediately knew what I was talking about and made some other suggestions based on restaurants she had frequented. My sisters and I went to the restaurant she recommended, Honey Pig, and were not disappointed. I can't say enough about the staff. Having working in a customer service field for over 13 years, they are clearly well trained and understand the positive impact outstanding customer service can make on an organization and their clients. The rooms are beautiful. All of the furniture is attractive and well maintained. The room decor, from the pictures on the wall to the art and reading material is first rate. The beds are great; I always sleep well and wake up without any aches. There are so many pillows on the bed, you have no problem combining them for any level of comfort you need. One of my favorite things about the rooms is the amount of storage. There is plenty of closet and cabinet space. Since I'm going to be there a week, I unpack as soon as I arrive and stow away my luggage in the closets. I also stow away food and beverages as I buy them and use them. Everything looks so clean and neat it makes me feel like I am in a luxury apartment. I forget about the day-to-day needs of being at home because I'm not seeing laundry, mail, kid and husband stuff, etc. The only minor issue I had during this trip, which was a repeat from the last trip, is that I had to call two or three days out of seven to get USA Today instead of the local paper, even though I put it in my profile when I checked in. The bathroom, as many others have commented, is huge. The tub is deep and large, the double sinks and storage are great, and the separated shower and commode areas add to the luxurious feel of the room. The TV in the mirror is great while getting dressed and ready for a day of gambling and playing. The room staff did a great job every day; an improvement from my last visit when they forgot to empty the kitchen area trash a few times and didn't always clean the wine or drink glasses. Lastly, I feel like I have to comment on the location off the strip and subsequent walking people seem to mention a lot in these reviews. I have been going to Vegas once a year for over 10 years to meet my four sisters. We have sometimes all stayed at the same hotel and sometimes split up among two hotels. In that time, we have sometimes rented a car and more often did not. There is always construction going on in Vegas, especially around the strip. We've walked among street scaffolding almost every year, and often walk from one end of the strip to the other, in total, during our stay. The walk from the strip to the Trump Hotel is nothing. In fact, with the exception of a short span where there is no sidewalk, it's the least congested walk you will have in Vegas. I actually look forward to making the turn off the strip toward the Trump Hotel, because I know there won't be crowds. It's all relative; I didn't measure it, but I feel certain it takes longer to walk from the Fashion Show Mall to Harrah's than from the Fashion Show Mall to the Trump Hotel. And it will be a less congested walk to the hotel. So if you come to Vegas and do it without walking, you must be wasting a lot of time in cabs, cars, buses, etc. The Trump Hotel has two shuttles which run regularly, and can be used late at night if it makes you feel more secure. But for me, the walk is nothing. As I walk toward the hotel, I look forward to entering it and not hearing crying children, slot machines, or crowds. It's tranquil and adds to the feeling of relaxation after a day of lights, sounds, and the craziness that is Las Vegas. Additionally, the hotel is smoke free and smells wonderful. The smell is imbedded in my memory as a positive one that brings a feeling of calm to me.

We did not eat at the dining room so we cannot rate it.. The pool area was brite and very sunny our entire stay. Also very hot but this is Vegas in June. The only complaint we have is that a certain client next to our room continued to smoke even when we complained to management. The antiroom reeked every day and night of cigarette smoke as we were entering or leaving our room. Yes, the rest of Vegas smokes but when we booked a non smoking hotel, we thought that was what we were getting. We did complain but some people do whatever they want regardless of the rules.

One - kitchennette, Two - sofa sleeper... my son was with us. The hotel was extremely nice but the bed was not what I expected for a hotel of this caliber. I travel a lot and the bed was not as comfortable as the \"Hampton Inn\". The sofa sleeper was worst. My son actually slept on it one day only. He choose to just sleep on the sofa and did not want to move to another room because we had a spectacular view of the strip. The hotel's staff was excellent, friendly and accomondating.. Because the Trump is a little off the strip there are two shuttles that take you to the strip with stops at the Wynn or Caesars Palace. This is a plus, but during the week they don't run very late (10PM & 11PM) and since things don't really get started in Vegas until sunset, this can really dampen your plans if you want to use the shuttle and not take a taxi. Most shows start at 9-10PM so you will be taking a taxi back to the hotel often. On the weekend they run until 12MN & 2AM. A little better, but not great for a 24 hour town. TIP - If you stay at the Trump, learn to ride the deuce ( public bus) to the Trump shuttle stops or walk through the mall across the street. It will save you a lot of time.

I couldn't wait until I got home, I had to bear the good news now. The focus of my excitement lies mostly in the room quality and the service. The Room: It is above average for a Las Vegas 5 Start \"Hotel\" Room because it is a Studio Suite. Perhaps the Venetian is larger, but this place shouldn't feel like little brother in terms of size. The cleanliness and warmth of the room is great. The bed is comfortable (we just took a really long nap - longer than my normal nighttime sleep). The furniture and decor is perfect. It is not over-the-top and gaudy as one would expect if all one did was watch Trump's \"The Apprentice\" and based our judgement of the man on that. It is just right. Opulent but not stiff is how I would call it. I did find a chocolate chip morsel with my barefoot - for a moment I thought it was dog poo - and I told my wife that I was going to get us their best room for free because I just stepped in it - but after smelling it (why I took that chance I don't know) and knowing it was just chocolate, I decided not to tell management about it. The best part of the room was the bathroom though - the marble bathroom. Not that we did this, but I think 5 ppl can fit in the shower and 3 in the hot tub (w/jets). It was that feeling you get when you're getting ready to go out for the night - you feel like a million bucks in this bathroom. Overall, the room was great. If it was in the heart of the strip, I could see them justifiably charging 3x what they charge per night. The service is 5 star all the way. They say Mr. ____ everytime they see me. They are quick to serve us because we are their guests. You feel important here; they achieve this without being stuffy. I wish I remembered the name of the check-in desk lady who was VERY professional and warm. All of the valet guys were great. The door man didn't miss a beat. I called at 1pm to ask for a later check out (check out was originally planned for 4pm!!!). The phone operator put me on hold, talked to the manager and gave us 5pm. This is a full 5 hours LATER than what any other hotel on the strip would have done. This alone makes this place the best. We left our two young kids at home (not by themselves, of course). But we could easily have been comfortable with them here because there is no smoking here, no gambling here and here is what they do have: rooms with FULLY appointed kitchenettes - perfect for kids. My wife's favorite part - the front door of the hotel is about a 25second walk from the front door of Nordstrom - she about died when she saw that. Thank you Trump for making our wedding anniversary (4th) so wonderful.

Since the Trump is a little way out of the main Strip (absolutely no problem; the free shuttle gets you into the centre of the madness in 10 mins maximum), and the pool is up on (I believe) the 10th floor, you are simply not over-looked at all.

In just a block or so, you come into the Fashion Place Mall, which you can cut through to emerge next to Treasure Island. From there, you can go from place to place with brief detours outside. The hotel also had a shuttle service to the Wynn. We stayed in the studio, and I found our room to be extremely quiet and comfortable. We slept great. It had a lot of eclectic touches in decor, such as art books and a set of coasters that looked like a tic tac toe game. The kitchen area also had a lot of amenities that would be great for a longer stay, such as a number of different types of glasses, utensils and appliances. The bathroom had an enormous bathtub and shower, and there were two very plush bathrobes for us. The valet situation downstairs was very cramped as we came into the hotel, but the wait to retrieve the car can easily be avoided by calling down just before you intend to leave. They gladly accepted our requests by phone, and the car was waiting. One thing that I will say is that no assistance was really forthcoming with loading or unloading our baggage; I would have expected it at a five-star hotel. The hotel required a $19.99 resort fee, which, while annoying, appears to be standard among Vegas hotels. The fee allowed access to the gym and pool and included bottled water, internet, and valet parking. The pool looked nice enough, but on a 95 degree day with the sun beating down, there was not one spot of shade to be found. They said that the umbrellas were not out because of wind, but it really was not windy. The hotel does not include a casino, which we viewed as a plus because of the lack of smoke and noise. Some of the people noted railroad noise as an issue--- I did hear this a couple of times, but it did not disturb my sleep. I imagine there are several hotels in the area where it must be audible. The rooms have a small atrium between two rooms before leading out to the hallway, which I think helped eliminate any noise from fellow guests.

The hotel staff are beautiful and it felt like being on a film set, they are helpful and really seem like they are happy to be there, kind and friendly. The first night we decided to upgrade to a corner suite, this had amazing views and had more room than some apartments I have been to! But I wanted to have enough money for lots of shopping, (which is brilliant, I will take empty suitcases next time!) so we went back to original studio for the rest of the holiday. The studio was massive and had everything we needed so this was perfect, beautiful bathroom with jacuzzi bath, double sink, huge shower and pure comfort.....did not want to get out of the bed it was so lovely. The food in DJT is delicious and a fixed prix menu at $29 for 3 courses a real bargain, wine is a little more expensive but worth it. I really wanted this holiday to be perfect for me and my daughter. Its hard sometimes with teenagers to find something that interests parents and kids, but with Vegas and its shows, sharks, lions, rollercosters, shopping and great weather, plus the pure beautiful luxury of the Trump....its the perfect holiday. Few things to know..resort fees $22 a night, plus they take $100 dollars per night stay for incidentals but you get this back, in actual fact as we were staying for 7 nights she only took $50 per night off the card which was helpful. If I did it again I would get a cab to a supermarket to stock up on essentials for the room, as there is microwave, toaster, hob etc but on the strip I found nowhere to buy food, you can also order this from the hotel, but I don't know the cost. My daughter and I walked to the Welcome to Las Vegas sign which was a long walk as it is very far up the other end of the strip so a cab would have been a good idea for that essential photo opportunity. The books that you see everywhere, the little red ones for free are brilliant as you not only get a map of the strip but details of restaurants and how much they charge, as well as attractions, shows and other helpful information.

We called housekeeping and this was all rectified very quickly..so thumbs up for promptness!! The shower in the room was luke warm at best, however the bath was lovely. We did not use the shuttle as we walked everywhere...the hotel IS in a fantastic location...5 mins to the corner where Stripburger is opposite the Wynn. The pool area was nice with attentive staff and lifeguards. Pool beds were also comfy and pool water the right temp. When we arrived the large sofa type sunbeds were free..however during and after a fashion show event at the hotel...they started charging $50 a day to use them! Also at the fashion show we were asked 4 times for our room card...as if they did not trust that we were hotel guests...also at the fashion show, a lot of emphasis was on promoting the trump and adhering to the needs and whims of the non hotel guests, and the hotel guests were neglected quite alot and made to feel, in my opinion quite insignificant... Ok, some more positives.. 1) Breakfast was lovely - cooked to perfection 2) A special mention must be given to the staff on the front door...every time we approached the door they were there ready to open the door for you with a friendly greeting Just a few other minor details... 1) Yes you can hear the train noise but to be honest...it does not affect you sleeping 2) This hotel was lovely to come back to after the hustle and bustle of Vegas...it was lovely not having a casino, and hoards of holidaymakers coming to see the hotel..it was also lovely that it was non smoking! 3) The fitness center was also good and it was good that you could print your boarding cards off for free...our resort fee was included and for this we got high speed internet, water, and valet", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTrump hotel is the most comfortable and spacious hotel in town.\u201d", "Author": "fifimar", "ReviewID": "UR105034253", "Content": "Very friendly staff and the courtesy bus into town in great.

Besides, if you're too lazy to walk a few hundred yards, get a taxi with the money you saved by staying at the Trump! Anyway - about the hotel. I stayed there in April and October 2010. The reason for returning to the US in October, was the Trump itself - it was our final stop on a roadtrip across the west coast. The suites are incredible. We've stayed in a studio on the 53rd (ish) floor and a 1 bed on the 57th floor, both facing the strip. The view is probably the best you can get from a hotel in Vegas, especially at that height. I would recommend getting the slightly more expensive strip side rooms, for this reason alone. I spent what seemed like hours, just watching Vegas go about its business from those rooms! Check in is great, the cleanliness is brill and the kitchens in the rooms are just what you need. A word of warning though; don't try and cook anything smelly in the room unless you have some sort of air freshener. We cooked a fried breakfast on morning 3/4 and we could still smell the results on day 9! The valet parking can be a touch slow but the service is not a problem - it's just the time it takes to find your car I think! The fact that it's compulsory valet parking means there's no extra charge; it's paid for by the $15-20 daily resort fee.

I know Vegas pretty well, and I can show you a thousand more dangerous spots in Vegas. The hotel lobby was magnificent and the people they had working the desk and door were helpful and polite at all times. Our room was great and everything was clean. My only complaint about the rooms were the pillows. I still have a cramp in my neck!!! We had room service which was on time, and everything was good. We ate at the breakfast buffet on Saturday, and spent over $50.00. We had a couple of \"ok\" egg-white omlettes, but I don't think they were worth the price. The gym equipment was pretty good, so we got a good workout Saturday morning. My last thing to mention would be the valet area, because we did not use the pool at all. We always rent a car when we come to Vegas, because I have relatives there that I go and see. I have never had an issue with Valet or self parking in Vegas. I have been visiting Vegas for twenty-five years, and partying here for nearly fifteen of those years. I have NEVER seen a valet situation this screwed up ever in Vegas! Their drive thru area in my opinion is rather small, so you had taxis flying everywhere, and the valet guys did not seem to have any control over the situation. My wife and I were almost got hit a couple of times trying to get across the driveway to wait on our vehicle. There were cars parked too close together. That whole area is screaming for an overhaul. They also need to make self parking more obvious to those that just want to park their car and come inside. Also there were times the valet guys brought us our car, and they did not get the passenger side door for my wife, and I tipped them. I believe the valet area needs to be somewhere else, or they get this under control immediately. We got a pretty good deal on our stay, so I really can't complain too much.

We started our stay at the Cosmo for two nights in a wrap around suite so it was a little hard to go to a smaller room. We stayed in a one bedroom corner suite on the 26th floor facing the strip and Wynn. The room itself is lovely and the decor is very nice. The problems we had were with the pull out couch. The mattress on the couch which someone mentioned in an earlier review stated that it was pretty flimsy. It was the worse we have ever encountered as you could feel every spring in it. I was surprised that a 5 star hotel would even consider placing a mattress like that in their rooms. The couch itself was very nice and looked expensive but the mattress looked like it came from Walmart. I called to see if they had a mattress topper. They said sure they would bring it right up. I was shocked when they brought up what looked to be a worn out mattress cover (not what I would call a topper) that was about 1/4 inch thick. You could still feel the springs through that. I then decided to take the comforter they provided and place that on top of the mattress and then use the sheets to cover up and blanket they also provided. I was so cold I ended up wearing one of their bathrobes to bed. The room was nice as I mentioned before but they could do with some kind of fold-up/down table in the guest bathroom as there is no where to sit stuff and we ended up placing all our stuff mainly on the floor. It has a pedestal sink with just a slight edge to it. The valet service was fine. We would call down before we went down to pick it up as it took a good 10 to15 minutes every time to get the car. The shuttle service everyone talks about was also good. The walk to the Wynn is long but the shuttle gets you their in just a few minutes. It was also nice to have the mall right across the street. As others have said you can walk directly across from the Trump entrance into the mall. We took our car when we were out late as we knew the shuttle only runs till around midnight. My daughter did have a salad at the hotel and it was very good. The free coffee they provide in the room is also very good. It is a very quiet hotel and the no smoking is nice.

The hotel is a very nice place with fantastic rooms and great staff however there are a few things that stops me giving the hotel a 5 star rating. Firstly the location isnt \"ideal\" and its a good eight/ten min walk to vegas blvd(the strip) and the walk isnt really a pleasant one either (especially in the dark) with a vast stretch of barren land on one side and the back enterances to the shopping mall on the other.However taxis are esily avaliable from the hotel but obviously this adds considerably to the cost of your trip if you take cabs everytime you leave the hotel.We walked in daylight hours and got taxis back in the evening. Secondly even thou the pool area is lovely and the staff great,i found the actual size of the pool area very small for such a large hotel.When we were there it was very early season and the pool coped quite easily but one can only begin to imagine what would happen if the hotel was full?? it was 90 degrees and only EIGHT umberellas/shades were actually avaliable for the whole area,this definatly needs looking at as no doubt this will cause problems in the summer months. On saying that we enjoyed the pool everyday and the ambience and atmosphere around there was just right.Music is played on weekends and we even had a DJ set on the saturday which was fab and lifted the whole atmosphere around the pool. Drinks were slightly too expensive we felt and maybe the hotel can look at an \"happy hour\" or drinks reduction of some sort because to spend a few days around the pool enjoying a few drinks/snacks will soon have you checking your bank balance lol.(12 dollars for some nanchos???)

The bad part is, I only stayed at Trump International for 2 of those days. I arrived from Connecticut on a 5AM flight direct to Vegas and after renting a car arrived @ Trump about 11:45AM. I was expecting to have to drop my bags and come back in the afternoon to check in. I was greeted at the front desk by Victor. Not only was my room ready, but Victor upgraded me to a suite with a strip view for no charge! After explaining all the hotels perks including a local newspaper, bottled water, and wireless internet, workout room, included for the resort fee. When Victor told me that the local paper, Las Vegas Review was delivered, I casualy mentioned that I prefer the USA Today. Wouln't you know it, the next morning, I had a copy of the Vegas paper along with a USA Today on my doorstep. I was blown away!!!! This is the type of service that will make me return again and again. The pool, which others have said is small, was actually (by my stepping it off calculations) is 40' wide X 150' long, large enough by any standard. They also offer free iced bottled water at the pool, along with big comfy towels, as many as you need. I have been to some places, where they ration out towels like ingots of gold. And not the entire time there, did I feel that anyone had there hand out for a tip. The waitress service at the pool was also excellent. I also liked the big sofa like lounges available free of charge. Oh, and did I mention, a 4 O'clock check-out time? Who does that? Fantastic for me considering had to change hotels mid-trip. Had I not pre-paid for my other choice, I would have stayed my entire trip at Trump. My last example of supurb customer service came about when I left a few articles of clothing in a drawer in my room and did not realize it until 48 hours later. Now, I chose his Hotel because, its about the only place where the manager responds to each and every comment left here on Trip Advisor, either good or bad. So, the only contact information I had was to contact Mr. Brian Baudreau be email to ask if my clothing could be found. Mr. Baudreau forwarded my request to the security department and Erinn Hamilton. She offered to ship my shirts out Fed-Ex at no charge to me. Wow! Once again, going above and beyond in customer service! I can't help but think whom ever trained these staff members should be commended. Also, the valet crew, who knew my name after the very first time I picked up my car. My ONLY complaint was that at the wee hours of the morning, you can hear the train blow it horn...... was awakened but fell back to sleep. Guess I can only blame Burlington Northern railroad for that one. The staff has made me a Trump fan for life!

When I was looking to book my stay I had a few requirements: I wanted something with a residential aspect (mixed use property), a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, *if* a suite then a second bathroom, and the price had to be reasonable. Location wasn't really an issue because I would be with friends who would be driving. It came down to Vdara, Signature, Palms Place, and Trump. In the end I spent one night at Palms Place and six at Trump. I arrived right around 330pm on March 6th (check out the 12th) and in my mind I had decided I would not upgrade unless I could negotiate a lower cost per night. I think I drove my best friend nuts constantly saying, \"yeah, I read about this on trip advisor...\" First time I used that sentence was when we walked into the lobby! It smelled WONDERFUL!! She agreed. We both, however, also could see how some may find it overpowering. I know my mom cannot handle strong perfume scents and would have had an instant migraine, but luckily I wasn't on vacation with mom, so it was welcome! Check in was a breeze. I had read some people say they were able to upgrade to a one bedroom for $30 a night. I figured that would be a reasonable starting point to negotiate seeing as though 5 of my six nights were not weekend nights. It was kind of funny when I said $30 and the desk clerk said, \"well, let me see what I can do...\" Literally, she walked 10 paces until she was out of sight, then must have counted to 5, and came back and said she could do it for $35. I accepted, but asked for as high up as possible. She said she had me on the 59th floor and gave me a great room. We headed up stairs, the elevators were VERY quick, and found the room at the end of the hall (5922). When we walked in and I saw the bedroom, I realized she really did take care of me. I had a corner suite!! It was awesome! I loved my room, my views were of the north strip and The Palms/Rio (as well as mountains). The train didn't bother me at all, but I can see how others would find it to be a problem, especially if they are a light sleeper. One little quirk I noticed with having a corner suite is that at night, before I would go to bed, I would have to close my bathroom door. The window above the bathtub does not have a shade to it. Very minor. Television channels were a bit lacking. I didn't care that there were not any movie channels, but it would have been nice to have E! and MTV. Before I arrived, my friends and I discussed doing a little MTV Real World Viewing Party for the Wednesday night premier, but we ended up scrapping the idea when we found I didn't have MTV in the bedroom or living room... The tv in the bathroom DOES have MTV, but we weren't that hard up to watch. I didn't get a chance to try DJT or H2Eu, but I did order room service twice. The Trump burgers are pretty good, and I ordered a Trump Sundae one night at like 2am, and it was to die for!! Housekeeping was exceptional! I have read other reviews that make me question if it is even the same property. I did have my do not disturb sign on the majority of the day (I might be 30, but I am still a night owl), and around 330pm everyday, there was a voice-mail left on the phone (they NEVER called the room, just accessed the voice-mail) that said they respected my privacy and therefore did not service the room; however housekeeping is 24 hours and to call should I decide to have the room serviced. I always called to have my room serviced, was never once made to feel I was a bother, and when I came back everything had been taken care of. Now, I did mention I was a night owl... The double doors into the vestibules were very heavy, and loud, and I tried to be mindful of my neighbors when I would come home in the middle of the night. I noticed some nights they too came in quite late. Other than those doors, I never heard any noise from the room next door. Some people mention the helicopters... I was at first baffled by that as a complaint, but then realized that Trump is seriously on the path of the strip helicopter tours! I actually liked it! Being so high up, I got a kick at how close they seemed to fly by my room!! It was also wonderful to have a full kitchen. There is a Von's grocery store not too far (Decatur and Desert Inn) and they will deliver groceries on orders over $50. Trump also has the attache service, which you can use to have your fridge stocked for arrival, but I am not sure what the cost is on that. I like that the freezer had an ice maker, I don't even know if the floors have ice makers or not because the freezer was stocked with plenty. The furniture in the room was very nice as well. I loved sitting in the chair in the bedroom area while putting on my shoes and getting distracted from the view. The couch, though nice, was a bit awkward for me, being 6'1\". I felt like I had to lie on it, or slouch and prop my neck with a cushion. The back on it was kind of low. Some of my friends made similar comments. It was also weird that the room doesn't have a work space. I wasn't here for work, so this didn't bother me either. Also, I thought this was odd... Both times I ordered room service the staff that came to my room made a comment that gave me the impression they aren't too familiar with the product... The first night I ordered,while the gentleman set the table, he was amazed when he was able to see I had windows on two sides in the bedroom. The second time the server I had told me I could move, or swivel, the tv so I could see it better from the table. When I tried to move it he said, oh, maybe that's just in some rooms. My guess is that would be in the studios so people could watch more comfortably from bed. Having a second bathroom was very nice. There were a couple of times I had to excuse myself from friends that were visiting so I could get ready to go out. I didn't have to worry about anyone needing to use the bathroom. It was also good because if anyone had to spend the night (the sofa does pull out, bedding is in the drawer beneath the tv in the living room) they wouldn't have to come through my room to go to the bathroom. I never did check out the Trump Store, but I did like that there are ATM's by the elevators, and the fees were reasonable. I really could just go on and on about how wonderful my stay was here. Valet was very quick. To me, location was PERFECT! I was able to be anywhere on the strip within 10 minutes. The back roads (Industrial, Highland, Dean Martin) are great for getting around. Having lived in Las Vegas and worked in hospitality, I used to love doing little staycations. I would always indulge and get a suite. I love the tower suites and penthouses at Mirage, the tower suites at Treasure Islands, marquis suites and terrace suites at MGM, ziggaraut suite at NYNY (I could go on...), but that was when I LIVED in Vegas. I mentioned my criteria earlier, and I will definitely be back. Signature has the worst valet I have EVER experienced, it is a pain in the butt if you have company coming to visit (which for me was EVERY day), Palms Place was okay, but I didn't like having a balcony that didn't unlock, and Vdara just has \"large soaking tubs.\" Trump had fast valet, my friends had no problems in stopping by to say hi, and the jacuzzi tub has three speeds, and must be the best I have ever had in Vegas!

Based on that limited experience, I'm not sure this place would rate as a true 5-star on a worldwide scale, but for the money (especially given a very favourable Aussie dollar exchange rate at the time) I'd rate it as outstanding value. I chose it for the \"no casino, no smoking\" factor, and I'm glad I did for two reasons ... 1) Nice to come back to that environment after a night out in Las Vegas. 2) During the day, it's a lovely, classy, relaxing atmosphere to enjoy. Gym and Pool area especially are nice & relaxing. Staff were very friendly & helpful, and the white bikinis came out at the pool while I was there! Rooms are very nice, and I'd go for the Strip view option - from the 55th floor, the view straight down the Strip is a highlight on its own. The shuttle to CP is very handy, although I'd like to see it run later - it's Vegas after all. The much-talked-of trains certainly can be heard at all hours, and while it didn't really bother me, if you are sensitive to that kind of thing then you'd best not stay here (bearing in mind LV gives off a buzz no matter where you stay).

Shopping across the road, some high end and some not, as well as some restaurants and an ABC store. If you sign up for a casino card at the wynn within a very short time you will be offered a free buffet for 2, which is outstanding! Trumps restaurant is very dark and romantic. Theres a gift store in the hotel opened till 10 or 11. We were always greeted entering or leaving the hotel. It felt very safe because it was off the strip, and it was very bright.

We had a marvelous experience at the Trump Las Vegas. It\u2019s situated very close to the strip, 5 minute walk. Coming to think of it, it took us as long to get street side while visiting from some of the major resorts that are right on the strip. As a plus, the hotel offered continual shuttle services to the Wynn and Caesars Palace (Forum Shops, to be specific) complexes \u2013 so casino\u2019s where never more than a short ride away. Yes, the Trump does not have a casino on site. To us, this was a major plus because it offered a much friendlier and slower pace to the Las Vegas experience. We were able to enjoy the nightlife and casinos like anyone else, but, as mentioned, we were able to retreat to our rooms without going through loud smoke filled casinos. Yes, the Trump is also smoke free. One very neat feature was having access to the Fashion Show Mall right across the street. It\u2019s a complete shopping experience if you enjoy shopping and you can get practically anything you may have forgotten at home, and then some! There\u2019s even a Tix4tonight booth where you can score some good prices on shows. The building itself is quite impressive. Without inquiring, it\u2019s probably the tallest hotel on the strip \u2013 we had quite the impressive view, especially at night, of the central and southern parts of the strip on our 58th floor studio (I was granted an upgrade to a higher floor and strip view). Upon entering the hotel, the lobby is quite spacious and very well decorated with elegant tapestry, columns of sparkling crystal and gold trimming \u2013 very elegant and modern all at once. Of course, this is to be expected from such a name as Trump. There were more than enough elevators to accommodate us. As a matter of fact, we\u2019ve barely ever waited more than 30 seconnds to have one service us to our floor. The room we had was more conservative in styling when compared to the lobby, but it was very nicely appointed, it had great furniture and the kitchenette was perfect to prepare basic breakfasts to get early morning starts. The bathroom is probably the best part \u2013 it had 2 sinks, separate and enclosed toilet and shower (very large) and a very deep jetted tub. There\u2019s room enough for all your stuff, and this includes cabinetry for clothes. It was nice to have access to a safe to store our valuables. The pool area was very nice. Although not a free form as I usually prefer, it was quite large enough and well suited for laps. The deck chairs were quite comfortable and there was more than enough for all the patrons. Pool service was great, they offered towels and bottled water on arrival and the waitresses were always close by to offer food or cocktails. As for restaurants, there are two: the H2eau and the DJT. The DJT offers a complete dining experience in a chic and very well appointed dining room. We had the table d\u2019h\u00f4te for diner once and ate twice for breakfast. The H2eau was more of a caf\u00e9/bar next to the pool. It offered a decent selection for lunch. Prices were very reasonable for a strip hotel. We would definitely not hesitate to recommend eating at the hotel. I was able to use the spa using a 25$ gift certificate included with our stay. I chose a hot stone massage and it was great to relieve stress from work and traveling. I felt great and refreshed as I came out. Upon entering and leaving the hotel I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve touched the door handles once. Bell and valet services were quick, courteous and efficient. This absolutely includes the guys who provided the shuttle services. Some of the friendliest people I\u2019ve met; always having a smile and striking up conversations without hesitation. As a whole, this general feeling was how we felt about every single employee we met at the hotel. Everyone from the check-in desk to the concierge, from the maids to the waiters/waitresses felt like they were there to serve us and make sure our stay was as enjoyable as possible. For our first time in Vegas we did not expect that and we were totally amazed by this level of service.

Location The hotel is across the road from the Fashion Show Mall which was very convenient. It is just off the strip but it is only a couple of minutes walk to the Wynn. The only inconvenience is that the sidewalk on the Trump side of the road was closed about 2/3 of the way to the strip and the road could really do with better lighting (not that the hotel has any say over that). But once you know that you need to cross the road while you are at the hotel end of Fashion Mall Drive there is no problem getting to the strip. The Room I stayed in a city view studio and it was in excellent condition. The bathroom is massive and has everything you could possibly need. The bed was comfortable and the in room wireless was quick and the connection never dropped out. The only thing the room was missing was dishwashing liquid and a sponge- I guess they don't actually expect anyone to use the kitchen. The Staff All of the staff we encountered were polite, friendly and courteous. We had one strange encounter with a housekeeper (she was outside our room leaving a note as we had set our room to 'do not disturb' as we didn't want any service, we then couldn't get across that we didn't need anything from her) but that was only due to the language barrier. I had read reviews saying that guests were not given the water or newspaper included in the resort fee. Housekeeping replaced our water everyday and the only time we didn't have a newspaper waiting for us outside our door was when we got up so late that they had already been cleaned up (thank you, jet lag). I also booked the room through Priceline and was certainly not treated any differently because of this (unlike other reviewers have felt).

Iron did not work in room # 1, iron from room # 2 worked fine. As you can see so far is was very helpfull having two rooms. These were minor inconveniences. Went out for the day Saturday, making sure that we turned on the housekeeping required lights. Upon our return at 5:30, we discovered that that neither of our rooms had been cleaned. I called the frt desk which transferred me to housekeeping. The lady at housekeeping was very apologetic, and ensured me that our rooms would be cleaned immediately. We left for the evening, and returned at 10:30. Guess what? Neither room had been cleaned. I called The frt desk which transferred me to housekeeping, nobody answered at housekeeping, so it rang back to the frt desk which transferred me back to housekeeping , nobody answered at house keeping so I was transferred back to the frt desk, which transferred me to housekeeping. Finally somebody answered. I explained that rooms still had not been cleaned. She apologized and offered to send somebody u immediately. I declined her offer as we were all tired and wanted to sleep. She said fine and asked if I would like to speak to a Mgr. I said yes pleas have a Mgr call me. I did not receive a call from a Mgr. About 20 minutes later, a lady (housekeeping???) entered room # 2 and upon realizing that people were in bed she immediately left. Why somebody was entering the room i have no idea. Sunday morning we left for the day, again ensuring that our housekeeping lights were turned on. Upon our return at aprox 5pm, again neither room had been cleaned. As we about to call housekeeping at 6 pm as we were leaving. A knock at the door. Finally housekeeping. Great. We went to see a show. Upon our return. We were shocked to find that only one room had been cleaned. Room #2 had not been touched. Now I'm not very happy. I call the front desk and explain what has happened over the past couple of days and that this would trigger a response of \" let me get a Mgr for you\" No I got \" let me transfer you to housekeeping\". I spoke with a lady who promised that the housekeeping mgr would come to see me. A short time later the housekeeping Mgr came. She apologized and offered to get the room cleaned immediately. I declined this as the boys were already in bed and we had to leave early in the morning to catch a Flight to L.A. For the next stage of our vacation. I told we needed clean towels. She returned with the towels and a bag containing about 20 bottles of shampoo and conditioner etc. What I was supposed to with 20 bottles of shampoo? She again apologized and promised to have our resort fees taken off our bill and that she would talk to the Mgr. Next morning upon checkout, the resort fees were still on our bill. The gentleman a the front desk said that there were no notes on our account to indicate that there had been a problem. So I then explained what had happened and what had been promised. He took the resort fees off. I thought that this would have prompted a \" would you like to speak to a Mgr\" But no, i was told that I would be receiving an email survey,and that I should address any concerns through the survey.

They do charge a $20 per night fee for the pool, paper, wireless internet.. No Casino, No Smoking.... Free Rides to the Wynn and Ceasars. I would catch the bus to go up and down the strip. You can not beat the price of the rooms for what you are getting.

Reading the reviews on here, I wasn't sure what to expect. After my wonderful experience however, I decided it was time to stand up for the Trump Las Vegas and inform people of this \"hidden gem\" We arrived at 11am on a Saturday after an early morning flight to check the place out before 4PM check in. From the minute I walked in the lobby, I knew we had chosen the right hotel. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the employees actually seemed HAPPY. I then went to ask the front desk employee what the earliest check in time would be, and to my surprise she offered to check me right then and there. Not only was she great, but the entire staff was gracious and accomodating. A perfect example was after I checked in and noticed there weren't any robes in the room (things happen, i understand). They immediately sent 2 robes up to the room, and then informed me of all the services included with the resort fee. I've paid resort fees at other Las Vegas hotels that only included WIFI. For the same cost here, I got to use the gym, WIFI, spa discounts, and we even received free shoeshines, which really came in handy after scuffing my shoes dancing at Vanity and Tryst. If I needed extra towels, I'd simply call housekeeping and within 10 minutes they would bring them up. The pool was stunning, and the drinks were awesome. The gym had functioning state of the art equipment, and even the elevators were efficient with little wait time. Overall this hotel was an excellent value, with a beautiful kitchenette room and jacuzzi tub. It was right across from Nordstrom and only a 2 short block walk to the strip. The valet parking got busy at times, but compared to Chicago or New York it was very quick to get my car. I suppose if I was coming from a small rural town, a 5 minute wait for a car might seem like an etermity, but in reality this is a smoothly ran operation. After staying at other properties where customers are treated as a number versus a valued client, it's refreshing to see that the Trump staff cares about it's guests.

The issues I had mostly involved my room. My girl friend and I shared a studio room which has a king bed and a sleeper sofa. I realized too late that this hotel was suppose to be condo's therefore none of the studios have two nice beds in the them. I completely blame myself for this oversight. I still feel strongly that no hotel that calls itself 5-star or 4-diamonds or premier should have a pull out bed as a primary area for sleeping, but again the bed issue was my oversight. The king bed slept very well. Before you enter your room you enter a quiet entrance which is nice. The hotel itself is very quiet and beautiful. A paper was waiting for us each morning. We had to request additional toiletries and toilet paper. We checked in on a Monday and were out of toilet paper on Wednesday. We requested robes and they took hours to get. Someone called to verify we got them and when we told them we did not have them the person apologized, but it still took hours to get. Soap scum/calcium was also built up on the shower head. I tried cleaning it, but it would not come off. The soap scum/calcium was still there when we checked out. The remote for the tv in the bathroom did not work (it was eventually replaced). The light up mirror in the bathroom did not work; we let the cleaning staff and manager know, but nothing was done about it. We also had to put towels on the floor Monday, because no rugs were left. The rugs showed up Tuesday. Their was a stain on the floor as soon as you walked into the room. Trash was left on the floor when the cleaning staff was emptying a trash can. The floor was not vacuumed (we knew this b/c lint was evident of the floor). My friend slept on the pull out bed and had to wrap her pillow in a sheet b/c no pillow cases were available. We eventually spoke to a manager about the issues in our room and he apologized and removed our resort fees and gave us a $50 breakfast credit. Unfortunately the hotel messed up my friend's breakfast order and that also was comped. The food was good. The hotel itself is beautiful and smells wonderful. Their is no casino and is smoke free, which I really liked. The hotel is off the strip, but across from the Fashion Mall. The hotel has a shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace. The bathroom also had a jacuzzi tub which was wonderful. I would suggest staying at a hotel on the strip.

The room was a nice size, the bathroom was great, the beds were very comfortable. Room service was excellent, my friends and I (5) total usually left the room late in the afternoon but we still came back with our rooms cleaned. One time, we were to tired to leave the room, after coming back from the nightclubs at like 5am, we came back to a tidy room. It was actually kind of freaky. The only complaint I had about the room was that the cell phone service was horrible in the rooms. I could barely make a call even by the window (At&T and T-Mobile). This is probably because the Trump is in a relatively undeveloped area. There is no casino, so the lobby is smoke and noise free. I did take a look at the conference rooms, gym and pool area. They looked nice. I did not try any of the restaurants nor the spa. The complimentary shuttles were amazing and helped to save a lot of money. I saw people with dogs in the hotel too. I think the Trump experience was a lot more personalized than the other big casino hotels. Also, it is right next to fashion show mall and there is a liquor store near buy. The staff were so friendly. They would joke with my fiends and I lot about how often we used the shuttle. LOL! There was also an association that came with stay at the Trump. Everyone automatically thought you had a lot of money, but we got an amazing deal in HOTWIRE.

AND I take full responsibility for not doing my usual control-freak research on TA. And, I brought home a story that will have me and my friends laughing for years (once we are able to remove certain disturbing images from our brains) ...And there were some positives: 1. Fantastic massage at the Spa 2. Really comfy beds. However: 1. We booked a \"Strip View\" room through Priceline, however when we checked in, we were informed we had a \"City View\" room. When we told the desk clerk we had paid for a Strip View, he said that Priceline doesn't book rooms correctly (or some nonsense) and that we didn't really \"pay\" for a Strip View. Uh, excuse me, but we DID pay extra for a Strip view. We just paid Priceline, not you. If you don\u2019t like how Priceline sells your rooms, either fix it, or don\u2019t do business with them. Not my problem. We got to the room and were disappointed with the so-called Strip View, but it is what it is (we had a great view of Nordstrom and Treasure Island and could see the pool if we pressed our faces up against the window). 2. Surprised to find there were no robes, only three towels (the kind you would expect to find at a Holiday Inn-and not a nice HI), and no bath mats (my husband slipped and fell on the marble floor getting out of the shower--law suit waiting to happen? I think so!). The next day (after being told we had to call IF we wanted our room cleaned\u2026um\u2026what??) we actually received nice big bath sheets, and bath mats. Then, while searching for a Spa menu (unsuccessfully), we read that the rooms were supposed to have robes. So we asked the concierge to send some up, she said she would, even asked if we also would like slippers (um, heck yeah!), but they never arrived. ON the upside, we did have a blender and a salad spinner. 3. Food & Beverage issues were too numerous to detail here and I really don\u2019t want anyone to miss.... 4. THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS REVIEW: And then there was the waitress who recommended we try the Spearmint Rhino club for breakfast. We thought, hey, we're in Vegas, why not go to a \"gentleman's club\" for breakfast--should be fun, right? And this waitress, who looked like a librarian (it\u2019s always the little librarian types, isn\u2019t it? The little minx!), said they had the best breakfast in town. Soooo I don't know what we were expecting (some sort of Cheetah Club/Waffle House hybrid?) but what we got was a low-rent strip club that was so dark we literally could not SEE the dancers, but what we COULD see was the skeezy guy next to us enjoying a Happy Ending with his lap dance. No joke. Hence the cloak of darkness I suppose. I guess you really CAN do anything in Vegas. And I'm supposed to EAT in this place? Ugh. So we hightailed it out of there and went to the Wynn for breakfast (which was fantastic). That\u2019s 40 bucks and 20 minutes of my life I\u2019ll never get back. **OH, message to the cute little under-age stripper who was trying to join our table...call your mother sweetie, or Facebook her, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s worried sick about you.** Anyway...point being, when I'm staying at a Five Star hotel, I do not expect to be sent to a low rent strip club for breakfast. If I want a little nudity with my hash browns I'd rather go to Waffle House and peruse a Playboy. This place gives a whole new meaning to \"scattered smothered and covered\"\u2026BUT again, as I am always a Glass Half Full Girl, this experience generated a lifetime-worth of laughs for us and our friends. But still...yeesh... 5. Day three, we were back to the Holiday Inn towels. What happened to my nice big bath sheets? Those were really nice. And still no robes. My husband spotted IVANKA TRUMP walking through the lobby with her entourage. I wonder if SHE got a bathrobe? I doubt it, because apparently, according to the Hotel Manager, they had a big Magic Convention coming to the hotel in the near future and he admitted that all the robes were earmarked for them. Uh...What The....? He did graciously offer to upgrade our friends and family to a larger suite if they ever come to Vegas. Nice offer, but I would never recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Vegas to gamble, experience the nightlife, etc--it's just too removed from the action and there is no \"action\" at this hotel whatsoever (it's a non-gaming hotel which we stupidly didn't realize until after we booked non-refundably...yes I know that's not a word). I'm not even going to go into the security issue our friends had (he has also promised a TA post and I'm sure he'll address THAT goat rodeo).

Service: This is a 5 star hotel. The service was top notch. I have never received better service from a hotel. They made us feel very welcome from the moment we pulled up to the valet. (Note, there is only valet parking. No self parking.) Location: The hotel is located across the street from Fashion Show Mall. However there are no crosswalks or anything to easily get there. There are shuttles that run to the Wynn hotel and Caesars Palace, however we never used them. The most convenient way to get around to the casinos was to take a cab. Or walk, but by the time we made it to the other end of the strip (Mandalay Bay) we were too exhausted to walk all the way back. Room: We booked through Orbitz for Strip View Suite. After checking in when we went to our room we found it was a Mountain View Room. The mountain view is not bad, just don't look down. That part of town is filled with gentlemen's establishments and erotic stores. After showing my reservation email to the front desk they moved us to a strip view room with no problem. However that room was missing a few of the amenities that were included, such as bottled water and bath mats. We also had booked a \"Pet Resort\" room which was supposed to include a bed for the dog, water bowl, and an extra bottle of water. After contacting housekeeping all of these items were promptly delivered to our room. Each room also shares a foyer with the neighboring room. There are doorbells and lights for the do not disturb. Cleanliness: Over all the hotel was immaculate. Our room however was another story. The shower head was dirty. And the corners of the shower had buildup. That is why I had to only give 4/5 for cleanliness. However again after contacting housekeeping they came up promptly to clean the shower. The rest of the room was already very clean, including the giant spa bathtub. Pets: We chose this hotel in particular because we didn't want to just treat ourselves, but our dogs too. The pet fee was $200, which covered our entire stay. Which is very reasonable if you are staying more than two nights in Las Vegas. Unlike other hotels the Trump hotel actually welcomes your dogs and allows them to walked through the lobby. Most other hotels I have stayed at have asked that dogs not ever be brought through the lobby. For a $20 fee you have have your dogs walked for you or you can take them out to the pet area yourself. The only downside to the pet area is the astroturf. Neither of my dogs would go to the bathroom on the \"carpet.\" Luckily there was a grassy area next to the parking garage outside the hotel. Room Service: After driving so far to get there we ordered room service on the first night. The waiter was extremely friendly and polite. He came in a laid out a table cloth, set the table with silverware, and then served our dinner as if we were at a restaurant. The food was piping hot, but nothing spectacular. Overall: Best hotel stay I have ever had. And if you want to go to Vegas without being in the middle of the strip then this the hotel for you. This hotel does not have a casino and so it is ideal if you have kids travelling with you.

There was Wolf Gang Puck coffee and creamers but no tea bags. We stopped at the whole foods about 5 minutes from there to get tea bags. Also, there were two telephones which we never used, desk, sofa and two nice chairs. Best of all was THE VIEW! We were on the 55th floor facing the train, but we could see majority of the city.

We expected longer from the other reviews we had read. The only downfall as for service is that room service will come into your room every day- wanting it or not.

I was there on business for a couple internet conventions including Affiliate Summit which was hosted at the Wynn. Location: Was splendid. I was about a seven m,inute walk from the Wynn and a about a 15 minute walk from the Pallazo. Those two are one the strip which makes the hotel close to everything, yet in a quite corner of its own. There are also curtsy shuttles that take you to the Cesars and the Wynn every hour. Price: Resort fee ????: First off, when you get to the hotel and check in, you will be informed that there is an extra $20 resort fee per night. I don't know if its just a Vegas way of screwing customers, but this was the Trump way of saying; have some internet and a newspaper every morning, you will be paying for it anyway :). Even if you have an Ipad and have all the internet you need, and have the NYC with you at anytime, have some of ours, we are not really giving you any choice here :). Breakfast: I had breakfast at the hotel my first morning. Its a decent buffet for $20. Including fresh orange juice and Starbucks coffee*. Well, i learned it was not exactly any Starbucks coffee. I enjoyed my breakfast and decided to conclude it with a Starbucks cappuccino. To my dismay, a cappuccino must not fit under the \"Starbucks Coffee\" definition. I was billed $8 for the coffee. Did the waiter mention anything about an extra charge, naaa, he just slapped it on there with a smile. not only was i surprised that the coffee was not included in the breakfast, the $8 prices tags sent shivers up my spine. That has to be the most expensive cup of coffee i ever drank. In NYC we complain about $3.50 for Starbucks. $8 is Ludicrous!!!! I paid $360 a night for the weekend nights which is very expensive, but it was one of the busiest weekends that Vegas has all year around since CES was taking place. I paid 100$ on the following Sunday after the convention was over which is a great value. Service: The employees of the hotel seemed to be very happy and helpful. They would always smile and greet you if passed in a hotel hallway. Im sure Trump management electrocutes them if they dont, just kidding. But it was actually a positive experience. Unfortunately, the smile and readiness to assist you did not come through when i needed it. I checked in on a Thursday afternoon. I immediately left the hotel for a couple evening meetings. When i returned later that even i was exhausted and wanted get an early night of sleep. I got in bed and realized that if i lay in the middle, i would roll to the right side as if the bed was tilted. I looked under the bed and tried to figure out if anything was causing the bed to be uneven. I was not able to find a quick fix and slept on the far left side of the bed till morning being too fatigued to call room service and start a process. I awoke in the morning and on my way to breakfast reported the problem concierge and was told the problem would be taken care of by the time i got back to the hotel later that day. To my surprise, i found nothing had been done when i returned to the hotel at around 7PM that evening. I called reception and expressed my disconcert that nothing had been done. They sent up a maintenance man to help out. The maintenance fellow was very nice, but did not know what was chasing the bed to displace. He called in another fellow who asked me what i wanted done. I was a bit confused since, i was not familiar with the bed construction and did not know what solution would alleviate the problem. I told him a new matters would probably fix the issue, or maybe its just the box spring i mentioned. after about 20 minutes of both of us caring the mattress of and on and then sitting on the two box springs, i realized one of the box springs was broken. I asked the second maintenance guy to replace the one box spring. He came back about 20 minutes later and the sinking mattress problem was solved. After the issue was solved, the employee that was assisting me assumed me that housekeeping would come by and make the bed after the sheets had been thrown all over the floor during our QA extravaganza. I told him that its fine, that i was going out for a couple hours and that as long that the they get new sheets and make the bed by 12:00 midnight, i will be happy. I came back to the room at around 2:00 am and nothing was done. I called reception again and explained the entire story again. They did send someone up about 20 minutes after my call to make the bed. All in all i got a good nights rest, but i did waist a good deal of time doing the hotels job, and i would expect a much high level of service for a hotel that charges $360 a night not including a $20 report fee and $8 for a cappuccino. Rooms: I think all the rooms are suits. I stayed on the 31 floor and had a very nice studio suit. The bathroom is very large and had a tv embedded in the mirror.

The lobby area was very nice and clean. My disappointment is soley with the spa. The personnel were mostly friendly (the front desk staff were a bit stuffy and uppity). I absolutely LOVED my therapist Morgan and spa attendant, Christine- they were incredibly friendly and the only positive things going for the spa. The spa only has one small sauna and one small steam room and 4 shower stalls. The changing area/locker room is very small (10x10). The spa lacks a vanity area, as well as such amenities (hair dryer, etc). I also noticed that the towels are not restocked frequently- for example, there are ice towels just outside the sauna area; there were only two face cloths left when I exited the sauna and they were wet cloths, as the ice had melted. The co ed relaxation room is also very small and is only stocked with apples and cucumber water; there is more than enough reading material though.

I chose the trump because a casino was a no-no for my 20 year old (she was actually ID'd and asked to leave the Bellagio casino) and the trump's proximity to the fashion mall made it a yes yes for the girls we caught a cab from the airport to the Hotel - 10 mins at most - and were disappointed to find that at 12.30 pm our rooms weren't ready - despite my pre-requesting by email an early check in. Nonetheless, we left our bags with a porter, and popped literally across the road to the Fashion Mall. It really is a fabulous mall, and we stopped to watch the catwalk show on the walkway and stage that arose from the concourse; you've got to see it to believe it but it was sensational - I guess that's why it's called the fashion show mall. we returned to the hotel at 3 pm to check in, and our rooms were ready. I'd used air miles to get these rooms, so they kinda cost nothing, so when the receptionist offered us upgrades for $50, I chose to upgrade the girls' room. nonetheless I was also upgraded free of charge to a strip view room. (although my view of the strip was in fact a view of the back of Treasure Island which sits at the bottom of the strip - if we were staying there longer or if I hadn't previously stayed at the Bellagio ON the strip I might have cared) we took the elevator up to the 39th floor, and reached my room first. each pair of rooms at the trump is separated from the corridor by another doorway and a small hallway. I have never seen this before and it meant there was no corridor noise audible in the bedrooms. brilliant. my room was sensational. a big comfy bed, a beautiful lounge, and a well equipped kitchen. the bathroom was great - a huge jacuzzi bath and separate shower and wc in it's own enclosure. it is the best room I have ever stayed in in any hotel........ until I saw the room the girls had been given a few doors down the corridor from my room was their suite; again a small hallway with their adjacent room, and then entry into a big lounge with an even fuller kitchen and a separate toilet and shower. then a good sized bedroom with a huge bathroom including a full size make up table, and, as in my room, a television built into the mirror spectacular, spacious, awesome, breathtaking - I don't have the words. this room really had to be seen to be believed, and if you can get it at a good rate, it is unbeatable. both rooms were very clean - maybe a little meagre with toiletries in the bathroom but no other criticism whatsoever. we went for a swim - the pool was warm but very shallow and we were the only lunatics there as it was so cold. the life guard said it is a law that governs the depth of pools where alcohol is served but this only only came half way to my chest - and I'm only 5'10 ish. the poolside chairs were comfy but the pool itself disappointing - a largish featureless rectangular pool. I wanted to be wowed by the pool and wasn't.I recall the pool at the bellagio and the other strip hotels were spectacular. c'est la vie. at night we went to see the O show at the bellagio. We queued for the buffet there before the show and made a mistake; the queue took over an hour and a half and though we got there at 7.30 we weren't seated til gone 9 and kinda had to hurry our food (which would have been sensational) to get to the show which started at 10 pm. a lesson learnt, and it was a shame that we were only in vegas for one night and we spent an hour and a half queuing- the girls didn't even see the fountains the O show was unbelievable - though very expensive and I couldn't find discounted tickets anywhere. I was initially disappointed to find we were sat on row 2 ( too close to the front I thought - we won't be able to take it in) but the show was awesome and we loved it. we were close enough to see the performer's faces and expressions and it was wonderful. If we ever go back again, I'd sit further back to see what we missed (if anything) but the show was great. On our return to the Trump, the concierge incredibly quickly checked us in for our flights and printed our boarding cards the next day, we got a cab to take us to the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign and then along the strip to Ceaser's, where the girls were just as blown away by the shops as I had been 5 years ago. Vegas has changed a lot since then; it's much bigger and busier but still has the power to astound. We had arranged a late check out from the Trump, and returned mid afternoon to collect our cases and fly back to San Diego. For the rooms alone, I would stay here again in a heartbeat, but the Bellagio had something extra and the view of the fountains and the strip - it would be a hard choice.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cA Night In Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "oktotravelanytime", "ReviewID": "UR92355702", "Content": "A very nice 4 Star hotel.

I had a full living room and dining area with full kitchen that had top notch appliances like a sub-zero fridge and freezer. The living room had a huge wrap around sofa that made into a bed and had a flatscreen TV. The bedroom had a king bed with another flatscreen and a huge bathroom. The bathroom had a shower with two shower heads. It also had a big jacuzzi tub and had a tv inside the mirror in the vanity. Both rooms had floor to ceiling windows with an amazing view.

Advantages: 1. Five star hotel for four star price 2. Rooms are like condos. Very impressive and spacious with full kitchens. 3. Strip view is great 4. Bathrooms are very spacious and luxurious 5. Check-in staff was friendly and professional 6. Right across the street from the Fashion Mall - wife loved this Disadvantages: 1. Over 1/2 of the lights in our room were unplugged - pretty unprofessional 2. Picked up our vehicle from the valet (BTW it's valet parking only). When I turned the key it was BLARING on rap music. Very unprofessional. 3. The train is significant. It came by 2-3 times and it's loud. No joke. 4. Went down to the pool. It was a beautiful setting. However, the setting was tainted by the inoperative gym equipment stuffed in the corner and the multitude of pool chairs that were ripped and tattered. 5. I booked a \"strip view\" room on hotels.com and when we checked in she said it wasn't a strip view room. However, she was friendly and did us a \"favor\" by \"upgrading\" us to a strip view. Next time I will have my reservation confirmation in hand when I check in. 6. Hotel is bordered by the Fashion Mall on one-side and strip clubs on the other. I'm not talking about one strip club... there's about two blocks of them. It was less than romantic pulling up to the hotel for our five year anniversary and passing strip club after strip club. Sketchy neighborhood to say the least. This hotel will not remain nice for long unless the lack of attention to detail is addressed.

They supply you with bottled water to use for free. That was a nice little perk. The bathroom was gigantic and had a whirlpool as well as a spacious shower and vanity. The bed was acceptably comfortable. There was also a little sitting room area near the window. CONCIERGE The people working at this hotel are very nice and are courteous and professional in helping you with whatever you need. Taxi stand is outside and there's never a long wait. One note: have your ID and room key with you when you come back late at night. They check before they let you into the elevator area. I guess they don't want parties or randoms. LOCATION This is the biggest downside to staying at the Trump Hotel, I think. It's at the end of the strip, but not actually on it. You have to walk a couple of blocks inward where there are no sidewalks and a few vacant lots. That's kind of weird. I think the recession might have stopped some planned development there, but nonetheless, it feels really weird when you're walking next to a deserted mall and vacant lot late at night. Also with the hotel being at one end of the Strip, you're not exactly in the middle of the nightlife action. It's a walk to any hotel. RANDOM NOTES -No casino in the Trump Hotel -Pretty good deal for the room that you get, but you have to be willing to walk a bit or pay a taxi if you want to go anywhere else. -Free valet parking, just tip the valet driver.

We rented a car and loaded up on groceries at a nearby Vons (i.e., a Safeway grocery store). If you're without a vehicle, the hotel's attache services will do the grocery shopping for you. We ate most breakfasts and lunches in our room and dined out for dinners. It was great to bring back left-overs to snack on for later. The hotel is located across the street from the Fashion Show Mall which is one of the nicer ones in Vegas.

Nice to have the option of a kitchenette - perfect for fixing your own breakfast! We dined in DJT which was an excellent value for the 3 course taster menu we had (only $30!). We didn't use the pool as it was a bit chilly, although it was opened and seems quite nice. The scent of the hotel is very pleasant and not too overpowering.

Typical for Vegas, We requested an early check in (flight arriving at 7am). We were told they hotel would to there best to accommodate our request. So when we arrived in Vegas after getting our rental car we went to the Hoover dam. What an amazing place. Then we had breakfast at the HO Ho Hash House on Sahara. Its a must if you want the largest pancakes. So we checked in at 11. Told no problem a room would be available. The great thing we learned when we got to the hotel is that it is a non smoking hotel.

The staff accommodated our request to have two other rooms with our family members on the same floor, even though they were booked separately. The room was spacious, very comfortable, quiet and full of amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable and we enjoyed the spacious sitting area (sofa, two chairs and a desk chair, with coffee table) with a view of the city. The bathroom was sumptuous with a deep, whirlpool tub, big enough for two, his and hers sinks, walk in shower, and soft / warm robes. Really, this was one of the nicest rooms we've stayed in anywhere. The woodwork and art / appointments in the room gave it an apartment feel and while modern, it was still quite warm and inviting. Because Trump is at the far end of the strip, and has no casino, it felt much less hectic and even felt safer than the other resorts on the strip that we visited. While the resort was busy with guests, absent were the tourists and day-visitors of the other resorts. Pluses: The elevators were fast and you never had to wait for one. The clock radio had an Ipod docking port and sounded great. The closets hid our luggage and clothing nicely, maintaining that \"just cleaned\" hotel room look, and we loved the lights that came on in them when you opened the doors. The floor to ceiling windows gave great morning and night time lighting. The valet parking was very useful to everyone in our party. Housekeeping did an admirable job. Minuses: our room was a little cold at times. One of the window vents didn't close properly and let in cold air until we covered them with towels. The bathroom TV didn't work properly, and the Engineers promised by the bellhop never showed up during our three night stay (no big deal really, this TV I think is more of a novelty anyway). There was no moderate or snack level cafe or restaurant on the premises (although we were able to bring in Pizza from the fashion mall across the street with little fuss).

However it may be good for guests who want to stay away fr hustle n bustle. This 5-star hotel has 5-star amenities, classy decor, roomy suites (basic suite that we stayed in has a small kitchenette) but its housekeeping standards cannot be matched. Firstly there's a compulsory resort fee of USD 20 imposed per night for services such as internet access (so-called 'free' access comes with a price tag), shuttle to Wynn, $25 spa credit (can't use if you don't spend more than $150), a 10% discount at Trump Store, daily newspapers. We didn't get what was promised. There weren't daily newspapers delivered to us. I saw the papers tucked nicely outside our neighbour's room but not ours. I thought ours might have been picked up by others, but after our 3rd morning, papers still did not arrive. I don't feel that the fee was justified. Any 5-star resort hotel could have provided equivalent stuff, they could have easily build in such costs in their room rates, so why does Trump make guests pay for what they do not need, such as discount coupons, shoe shine services or printing of faxes? it's ridiculous, since some of these services are meant for business travelers. From day one of check in, we could only find facial bar soap for bathing because there was no other provisions (besides shampoo and conditioner). We thought this could be the norm, never did we realised that there's actually bathing bar soap for each room but we got ours only on our 3rd day! More horrifying was to find soapy water in the supposedly cleaned bath tub when we tried to fill it up for a soak. This means that the staff forgot to rinse the bath tub clean after applying cleaning agent! In the end, we had to rinse the tub thoroughly before using it.

The room I got had a crappy view though. Maybe this is because the hotel itself is so far from the strip. One of my major complaints since there is no casino in it. It's just a hotel. You can walk to the strip I guess, but it's a pain when you are wearing heels. And the part you have to walk to get to the strip is kind of ugly. Nothing there just rubble. But we decided to walk anyway because the parking is valet only. Another complaint. Wish there was self-park because then you have to tip every time. Would I recommend this hotel, yes. Only because it is a hotel review. But I don't recommend it to singles or people trying to have a fun time in Vegas. I personally think it is too far from everything that is going on.

The toilet paper holder is positioned so close to the commode that every time you sit down, your knee knocks the roll off the holder. Annoying, but hardly worth mentioning. The parking valets can get overwhelmed at times - I understand it is difficult to predict comings and goings, so just keep it in mind; if you are in a hurry, call ahead for your car. Lastly, the housekeeping staff was a bit forgetful at times. One day we found now washcloths, another no coffee for the coffeemaker, yet another no bottled water. Again, not problems, just minor inconveniences. Overall, an overwhelming endorsement of this fine hotel - the lack of smokers makes the beautifully floral scented lobby even more spectacular. the porte cochere with it's gleaming brass and gold makes you feel like you have arrived at a castle.

Now some of your other hotels may have their own string of shops but Fashion show mall is so close to the Trump and yet it has 'normal highstreet shops'- this is a factor I love about the Trump and something I would consider a unique selling point eventhough the two are not officially linked. Once you have walked the length of fashion show mall you are on the strip...how easy- it shocks me that people complain the Trump is out the way as it's not, unless you are really lazy.

Well, trump absolutely did NOT disappoint ! we have stayed in many 5 star resorts around the world and trump is truly exceptional in the room decor which is very tastefully decorated and the service by housekeeping and front desk are fantastic. i presume some of the mixed reviews come from people who were expecting something else quite different. imho, if you are like me, in the 50s, wanting a property that exudes quiet elegance, upscale living, extensive fitness room, exceptionally efficient service, smoke-free environment, no casino, then trump las vegas is THE place for you. however, if you are in your early 20s and expecting rowdy atmosphere by the pool and loud partying with drinking and getting drunk and abnoxious then trump is NOT the place for you. we were lucky enough to get a corner premium corner suite on the 58th floor and the view is to die for ! at night, when i am in the bath tub, i can see all the neon lights right outside because the window beside the bathtub is huge. the full kitchen is great...sub zero fridge, wolf stove and oven, bosch dishwasher and microwave and dishes and pots were all brought up so quickly for us. in our unit is 2 full bathrooms and the handy kitchen where venetian has no kitchen and only 1 bathroom. the size of the master bathroom is huge ! it even has a plasma tv built into the mirror. i was anxious about the elevator accelerating and decelerating too strongly but it absolutely did NOT do that. i have vertigo and i had absolutely no problems with the elevators. they were efficient and not shaky at all. others have also complained about the location being far away from everything, but they have a complimentary shuttle that brings you to the strip every 15 mins and if you have your own car, the trump location was no probs at all. it is directly a hopscotch from the fashion show mall , nordstroms, and across the street from encore/wynn. we really liked the trump location. in conclusion, if you want to try out the trump but you have hesitations like i did, let me reassure you that you will not be sorry. trump is definitely a very upscale property that exudes grandiose and luxury with quiet elegance. we know we will be back to the trump on our next visit to vegas. we love our corner suite very much. thank you trump las vegas for offering us such excellent accomodations/amenities.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, AZ", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel stay ever. Affordable luxury. Will always stay here when in Vegas.\u201d", "Author": "dnrinaz", "ReviewID": "UR73486664", "Content": "After considering other hotels and reading different reviews, I was going to stay elsewhere as we were on a budget. I don't even remember how I ran across the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas but there was a special of $96 a night and we were staying 2 nights so we took it. I was so glad that we did. I spent about $25 more than the other 2 places that I was considering but after coming home, I realized that I made the right decision. I have to say first of all, we try to go the cheap route when coming to Vegas, staying at places like the travel-inn or travel lodge, super 8 and so-on, so the opportunity came about to have a little bit of luxury for not much more so we went for it. Let me start with things that I didn't like about this hotel (which isn't much) just to get them out of the way. Dislikes: There is a train that runs fairly close to the hotel that whistles very loudly at all hours of the night. (other reviews have stated that as well but you get used to it and pretty soon it doesn't bother you.) For security reasons, there are outer-doors that you have to use your key to open up and then your room door and the next door is inside of a foyer and it becomes very loud and slamming of door sounds when people are coming and going. That can get annoying when it is late at night and you are trying to sleep. There is a resort fee of $14 that you have to pay for each day you stay, and I think that if you use the pool, spa, and so-on, then yes, you should be charged, but if you don't use these services, you shouldn't be charged and should have a choice. So if those are the dislikes, then this hotel is still within the 5 star calibur for me. I stayed in room 5500 on the 55th floor in a studio with a strip view and these are the likes about my stay: As mentioned in other reveiws, there are certain ammenities that are here and not at other hotels that I stayed at: TV in the bathroom mirror, jaccuzzi bathtub, giant tv in the sitting area, king size bed (with the most comfortable mattresses and bed linins that were so crisp and clean, I never wanted to leave the bed), plenty of sitting area (with a couch and 3 chairs), the full kitchenette (complete with toaster, microwave, stove-burners, mini fridge, blender, utensils, and cookware), hair dryer, separate shower and toilet room, bathroom scale (just in case you want to weigh yourself while on vacation?), robes to use, iron and ironing board, lots of closet space and drawer space, free newspaper and the most amazing view of the strip looking towards treasure island all the way to Mandalay bay. The staff was incredably helpful and went out of their way to make sure that all our needs were met and were available for anything at anytime. They truly went above and beyond for us and I felt like I was an important guest. In other reviews I saw that people hated the fact that there were staff members waiting by the elevators and checking keys and I felt that it just helps to make sure only hotel guests get on the elevators and it wasn't a bother for us to get our keys out, as we needed to get them out to enter the room anyway. We ended up stuck at the excalibur hotel and didn't want to spend a fortune getting back to our hotel so we called the bell desk to ask what we could do that was cheap and they said, no problem, and sent a car to pick us up. No charge whatsoever. (We did tip the guy, but that was much cheaper and faster than any other means of transportation). That is what you call number one A+ service. It is across the street from the Encore and Wynn and next to the fashion show mall so not exactly on the strip but you have about a 2 minute walk (the width of 1/2 of the mall) to get to las vegas blvd. On some of the other reviews, people talked about how far it was from the strip and was not very convenient, I think that is because some people are lazy and probably should walk if they are going to complain about 120 seconds of walking. I think that the location is more towards the middle of the action, very centrally located. Overall, I was very pleased with the level of value, luxury, friendliness of staff, ease of checking in and out, comfort level of the rooms, and location of this hotel. I am telling all of my friends about my stay and will aways stay here while in Vegas and hopefully get the same room as I was completely satisfied with my stay.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Author": "branci", "ReviewID": "UR73483530", "Content": "Sooooo nice, we didn't want to go out.

Initially built as serviced apartments (and some rooms are owned exclusively) most of the building is now a hotel with kitchen's in every room. We upgraded on arrival to a 1 bedroom corner suite for $30 (USD) a night and boy it was worth it. The views overlooking the Strip from this side of the hotel were fab, especailly at night. The bed was huge and plush, the main bathroom is probably just as big as the bedroom and the living space is very generous and included a second bathroom, which is still a decent size. The kitchen is in general well equipped although it was lacking in pots and pans, although I'm sure if we had asked for some they would have been supplied. The hotel is not on the strip itself however it is only a 10 minute walk to it, or you can jump on one of the 2 free shuttle services supplied. One takes you to the corner or the Fashion Show Mall the other takes guests to Caesars Palace - be warned however the one to Caesars is very busy in the evening so get in the queue early so you get a seat! You can also cross over the road and walk through the Fashion Show Mall, if it is open, where there are a larger number of shops and a food court if you want something quick and easy. Trump towers doesn't feature a casino, but actually that was probably one of the nice things about it - calming after walking through all the other places and despite the fact that it was fairly full on the weekend it didn't feel like it was, unlike the other large hotels we visited. The staff are brilliant, the service impecable and rooms are great. One down side I would say is that there are not enough sun umbrellas by the pool, which are definately needed if you visit Vegas in July!

She didn't even do her job probably as just going room to room stealing stuff, since she wasn't cleaning. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, no one deserves to feel like this, or be violated, and have their stuff ransacked. The experience was disturbing to say the least.

The whole ambience of the hotel is very regal and luxe. It looks and feels a little over the top upon first look, but improves on closer inspection. It was my first time in Vegas, and I am so glad I chose the Trump International. Even though it is not on the Strip, it is only a quick walk to the Wynn on a road that was relatively busy with cars and a sidewalk for pedestrians. We even took the more 'scenic' route through the Fashion Show Mall a few times, which was directly across the road from the hotel. My friend and I walked the distance quite frequently, even in the 110 degree heat and were never concerned for our safety. It really is a quick walk, and there is a free shuttle that takes you to Caesar's Palace which is considered the middle of the Strip. Although the shuttle does not run past 10pm, and given this is Vegas we found that we couldn't make much use of the free shuttle given we were staying out a little later than that. The staff seemed nice and helpful, although housekeeping was a little lax. Our room went unserviced for a day, and it was looking very likely we were going to go without housekeeping for a second day when we returned from the pool late in the afternoon to find the room still as it was. Luckily our housekeeper was in the next room, so we were able to catch her. When we told her that we would be leaving for a show in the next 30 minutes and perhaps she would prefer to come back then so we would not be in her way, she advised that her shift was ending at 5pm and could not come back. Whilst the bathroom was always immaculate after housekeeping, the bedroom was not. The side tables were quite dusty and one day we came back to find the ice bucket had not been emptied and was still full of water. On our last day, even though we had the 'do not disturb' light on, the housekeeper entered our room which we thought was a little inappropriate. The room was an excellent size, great comfy bed and a nice lounge area. Perhaps some more lighting would help as it was quite dark, and also some bedside light switches. We were on the 50th floor and heard the train every day...how could you not? The heavy doors of the rooms were also very loud, they slammed shut. You can also hear the helicopters quite frequently so perhaps noise levels could be controlled somehow? The view was not great, overlooking empty lots and the train tracks, although you could see out to Circus Circus and the dead part of the Strip. The kitchen and fridge were very useful, although we did not have enough cutlery or crockery. Given there were two people staying in the room, you would expect at least two of everything. We only had one spoon, one bowl, and on our last day for some reason ended up with one dinner plate. The complimentary internet was super fast - the fastest I have ever used, and was easy to connect to. Although there was no pen or writing paper in the room, which we found out when needing to write down some confirmation numbers. Room service was delicious, with generous portions and the best french fries I have ever tasted. Even though most hotels charge high prices for room service I don't think I have ever come across a delivery charge for room service. Isn't that why you pay an extra few dollars per item...given it is room service? So it was a little baffling to be billed $3 for delivery on top of the already ridiculous high price of room service, and then add tax and the compulsory 18% gratuity. Wow! We were also keen on using the spa, but keeled over in horror when we saw the price list. I was in dire need of a manicure, pedicure and massage, and a blow out would have been considered too. Upon seeing the prices, $60 for a manicure only?? Such robbery! You can get a mani/pedi combo for around $25-50 all around the US, not $60 for just one! The bathroom was amazing, nice and big with the best shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap. Oh and yeah, there is a TV built in the mirror which made us chuckle when we discovered it although we never used it...'only in Vegas'. We spent a lot of time by the pool which was decent although not deep enough for a proper swim and most guests tended to use it to lounge about in the water. We found the pool quite dirty on one of the days, which you would not expect from a 5-star hotel. The children were plentiful and perhaps a separate pool should be considered. The music was excellent, not too loud but just right to set you in the mood for the evening ahead. Some of the patrons were a little over the top and embarrassing to watch, but I suppose this is what Vegas is all about. A shout out to the 'cougars' who ridiculously pounced on every male over the age of 21 in the pool, you entertained us well. Overall, our experience was good although upon checking out we were a little annoyed when the porter helped us into the taxi by putting our two suitcases in the trunk and then walked off and left the trunk open - we wondered whether it was because we didn't tip? We had two medium sized suitcases that we could have easily wheeled over to the cab which was two to three steps away. We had also brought our suitcases down from the room and walked all through the lobby with them - and no one asked if we needed assistance or a cab.

We were in town to celebrate our 30th birthdays and from start to finish, we had a wonderful experience. As mentioned in other reviews, you are treated like gold from the second you arrive to the second you leave. Check in was a breeze and we were upgraded from a studio suite to a one bedroom suite, with a great view of the Wynn and Encore. The orginial price of the upgrade was $50 a night, however, acting on adivice from Tripadvisor, we easily haggled the price down by half. The upgrade was well worth the extra money. The one bedroom suite was huge with a great kitchen and living room, a sperate bedroom and two bathrooms - one of which is beyond huge! This made getting ready for a night out on the town easy and the huge fridge was great for storing water and other drinks. We did have an issue on our first day with housekeeping. We left the room early, turned on the housekeeping light and headed out for shopping. When we returned to the room just after lunch there had been no cleaning done. We left again assuming they had just not gotten to us yet. When we returned again at about 7:00 to get ready of a night out, we still had not recieved any service. A quick call to the front desk and within minutes a housekeeping supervior arrived at the room. He personally made the bed and took note of everything that needed to be done. By the time we returned for the night, the room was spotless. Although the room should have been cleaned earlier and without us calling, it was nice that the problem was fixed quickley and efficently. All in all I would not hestitate to stay at Trump again. In fact, I am already planning a return trip! Yes there is a resort fee (this is no secret and they tell you about it at check in) - but there is at most Strip hotels. One look at the pool and all the other amenities and services offered and it is easily justifiable. The Strip is, at the most, a three minute walk. (The street is well lit and thier are sidewalks the entire way. I am not sure which route other reviewers were taking ??)

Great bed, sink and fridge, and the bathroom was truly stunning! Over the course of three nights, we got to know several of the service staff in the lounge and dining room.

My wife and I did several runs back to the hotel to dump off bags. The feeling of security at the hotel is also worth mentioning - there is always a friendly nod from discrete security staff manning the access to the elevators upon coming back.

I understand that in the restaurant and hotel industry things happen, having said this what my guest and I experienced at the The Trump Hotel, I feel, needs to be relayed as to not further disappoint future guests expecting not only a five star hotel but five star service. Upon check in we were moved to an extremely noisy room right above an outdoor pool that was playing very, very loud music and crowded by an equally as loud crowd. I am 30 years old, not 60, and I felt as though I was at a frat party. We asked to move which they accommodated. The moved us to another room that was just as noisy. We called the front desk and were told that someone would be right up with not only our bagged but keys to another room that was promised to be much quieter. 45 minutes later, no bags, no keys, we are starving and decide to just go our selves to the new room and wait up there. When we get off the elevator and turned the corner a very upset bellboy shouted, \"Well, there you guys are! I have been waiting here for over half an hour!\". Well, please excuse us. Anyway, we get settled into our new room which is quite nice. We at this point are starting to regret not having gotten lunch prior to arrival and promptly decided on room service. No menu was to be found. We call the front desk and another 45 minutes later a menu arrives. We decide to go out. I realize I have left a $1000 pair of Chanel shoes in one of the previous rooms. We call the front desk and receive a very poor response. Somewhat like it was my fault I had left the shoes in the first place. To make a long story short with still getting the point across, we called about the shoes at around 4pm and did not have the shoes returned to us until after 10pm. This is after countless phone calls to the management, Orbitz, American Express, the hotel security and housekeeping. Finally a manager named Glenn went to one of the previous rooms and simply knocked on the door and asked the new guests if the shoes were in the room. They were and they were returned to me. Now, why and how housekeeping could have overlooked a pair of shoes sitting right on the first surface once you walk through the front door is beyond me but even more so, how the staff as a whole continuously promised both rooms had been thoroughly checked and there were no shoes was insulting. I felt as though I was being called a liar for about 6 hours. The amount of attitude we experienced was totally out of line. The whole experience was upsetting so we cut our trip short and checked out a night early. When we go to get our car from valet the car pulls up sans our luggage. Nearly half an hour later and frustration having become the default emotion being on the Trump property our bags were finally put in the car and we left. The Trump Hotel was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a hotel. The crowd was definitely not a 5 star crowd.

The nearby area is still undergoing some construction but I suspect that it will one day be in the thick of things. We walked during the day and returned in the late evening (11ish) on at least one night without any problems and feeling secure. The staff at Trump is top notch no matter what time of the day and we really appreciated the quiet sophistication of the Towers themselves. I personally enjoyed being able to live in a smoke-free environment from start to finish, something that is impossible when a casino is included in the mix. We had an option of upgrading our room for a small amount per day when we arrived though we declined it. Our studio bedroom faced away from the Strip looking down on the less savory Industrial Road which is exactly as you would imagine a road bearing such a name to look like. Even being on the 30-something floor we could clearly hear the trains that would go past but other than thinking \"Is that a train?\" we took little notice of them and would hardly call the two or maybe three we heard in three days much of a nuisance.

Even though this was clearly my error, I could never recommend staying at this hotel simply because they have demonstrated a lack of five star customer service.

If you happen to wake up you willl hear it as it blows its horn three times as it gets close to the crossing. Since our room was so nice we didn't want to take a chance of losing it so we learned to ignore the horn since it was only a momentary inconvienence. Everything else went very well, the walk to the strip only took a few minutes and if you didn't want to walk then the shuttle was there for a quick ride. We ordered room service one night and the club sandwich was very big and we had extra for the next day. In our room we had one king bed which had seen better days.

After a people filled day at the convention center, it was pure Zen to return to a hotel and not have to walk right into the hustle and bustle of a casino. While there were other customers, everyone was relaxed and smiling. Plus the genuine friendly greetings starting with the doorman to the bellman to the front desk to the bar, made coming back in from a long day bright again. These folks have been well trained to truly understand the value of me - the customer. All of this so far without even mentioning the rooms! From the secure moment you walk in, you feel like home. Our view of the strip was even better to gaze at then turning on any of the three state of the art televisions we had. I was so happy when at our favorite restaurant on the strip I had left overs and could actually take them home and have for lunch the next day since we had a place to refrigerate and warm up. Not just any place, but a SUB ZERO refrigerator and a VIKING stove!! Being a shoe junkie I was delighted to see closet and drawer space that rivaled my own home. Really too many wonderful amenities to mention them all, but this review would not be complete without mentioning the FABULOUS bed. While the heavenly beds are supposed to be for the angels, I think this TRUMP bed was reserved for the big guy in heaven himself. Yes, I will return to Las Vegas and stay at the Trump.

Perfect setup for someone like me because this is a condo hotel, not a Vegas \"casino resort\".

You have all the Strip action available to you when you want to participate - but you are one step removed and don't have to deal with it unless you choose to. A couple of things not in other reviews: 1) There is a \"bistro\" food option at the hotel if you don't want the DJT fine dining option. It's called H2EAU and it's on the 7th floor next to the gym by the entrance to the pool. You can get casual food here all day long. 2) Housekeeping was thorough and effecient. I question other reviewers complaints - my room was made up daily while I was out and never a problem. 3) Ask for a high floor on the south side of the building. I was on the 54th floor looking right down the Strip. Awesome. Worth the $25 per night upgrade on my $99 Hotwire rate. 4) NEVER once did I hear the train - what are other reviewers talking about??? 5) My internet was included in the $19.95 \"resort fee\", not a seperate charge on top of the resort fee. 6) There is a store in the Fashion Show Mall across the street called ABC. You can get everything you need to stock your fridge here - pop, juice, cereal, snacks. 7) The walk thru the Fashion Show Mall to the Strip is easy and entertaining and takes 5 minutes tops. When the Mall is closed, don't walk, take a cab or the Trump shuttle which is convenient and reliable. I used the Trump as a base. I had activities planned (heli tour to Grand Canyon, the BC Zipline, golf, etc) during my days. Then I partied and gambled on the Strip at night. Trump was great to come home to and not have all the casino honky tonk and cig smoke right in your face when you were done with that scene and wanted to get real again.

We ate in the restaurant on one occasion and took advantage of the $39 deal which was good value and the food of a superb quality. However, for an overall Vegas experience the Trump was a bit of a let down. The pool area is more like somewhere you would go for a swimming lesson rather than a 5* hotel in Vegas. Also when in Vegas after a late night I like to relax by the pool during the day. This was possible on the first couple of days however on the Friday and Saturday there was a dj playing overly loud music from about 11 am each day. So loud it also made listening to my ipod impossible, we tried to move to get away from it and complained but had no luck. The appeal of staying off the strip is that you have the choice when you want to relax and when you want to be amongst the hustle and bustle. During the end of the afternoon as people are starting to get ready for a night out I could understand loud music but not so early in the day. I am only 27 and going to the bars in the evening that would be playing this music and didnt appreciate it so not sure how some of the older guests appreciated it! At $14 a cocktail and seemingly no offers available its quite expensive to drink at the pool as well. The location was more inconvenient then I would have hoped for as there is nothing really about. There isnt much option for food at the hotel and its not convenient to go to the strip for food during the day as its quite a long round trip. In the end we walked a fair way to some shops towards Circus Circus and stocked up on essentials so we could make our own breakfast and lunch and then for more variety went to the Wynn in the evening for dinner.

I did not have a bad stay here, but I never plan on staying here again. Anyone going to Las Vegas would be better off staying at the Four Seasons, the Hotel at Mandalay, Mandarin Oriental, Bellagio or the Wynn if they like 5-star accommodations. First, the location is at the north end of the strip set back from Las Vegas Blvd on Fashion Show Drive. This in itself is a problem, its a 5 minute walk up to the Wynn, but the hotel is out of the way. I have been to Las Vegas 37 times and I did not like the location. If you have a rental car ( which you should because you will spend a fortune on taxis staying here), it is easily accessible of of Spring Mtn Road on I-15. I-15 is the key to getting around Las Vegas quickly. Next, the hotel has free valet parking which is included in the resort fee. I personally like to self park. There is no self park option and I hate having to make sure I have a enough singles to tip valets. The service is friendly. The doorman and valets are polite along with the maids. One thing I did not like was when I called down from my room to have my car brought around I was told that \" We do not do that\". Frankly I dont care, this is a 5-star hotel, If I want my car brought around, it should be brought around. Also, I do not like being asked to upgrade my room 5 times. I said no thank you the first time......how about a strip view...how about a high floor etc etc it was annoying. THe pool was nice but was too windy. The fitness center is very good for a hotel. Plenty of cardio machines with TVs. There were no headsets however. It did have a water machine. Dumb bells go up to 50 lbs. Hotel has a nice, but very expensive spa as well. The room is quite large and spacious. The bathroom is excellent, very large tub ( easily fits 2) and a huge shower. However, the shower could use a rain head or another shower head. Its too big for just a normal shower head. There were plenty of towels, excellent water pressure and a bathroom tv. The bed was comfortable as well as the sheets. The room had a subzero refrigerator and small galley kitchen. There was also a sitting area. No laundry bag however and the electronic do not disturb sign was broken. One thing to note, there is a main door for two hotel rooms, an outter door and then your room door. This can be very loud at night if your neighbors sharing a main door are not courteous.

Trump was terrific. Yes, had read all the reviews. Knew about, not being right on the strip, the train and the resort fee. This place is luxurious, relaxing and romantic. No smoke, no casino to be forced through. So glad we didn't stay at Caesars. The bed was heavenly, the whirlpool tub devine, the view spectacular. Had a studio, which comes with a kitchenette and sitting area with 2 sofas. We knew this and planned on healthful relaxing breakfast (oatmeal, fruit and nuts) in the room each morning, sitting on the sofa watching the view and sipping the Wolfgang Puck coffee (provided with coffee maker) was delicious (worth the resort fee alone) and just request more, no problem. At night used the provided cork screw and wine glasses, after a show and watched the view again. When checking in asked to have the resort fee waived, they politely declined. Asked for a room on the highest quite side, got a room on the 56th floor looking downtown. Was offered a room on a higher floor for an additional $20 per night which I did not accept. Never heard the train. There is a lot of walking. The walk to the strip can be fun if you have the time or a pain if you are in a hurry to dinner or a show. If in a hurry take a taxi, if not enjoy the stroll. When checking out I reported that the in mirror tv in the bathroom initially did not work and had to be fixed, because of this asked I if the resort fee could be waived and this time my request was granted.

Ask for a high floor on the quiet side to avoid the train noise. Ask for the resort fee to be waived and ask again if you can report anything was wrong. We knew the restaurants we wanted to eat out at in the evening so we planned on using the kitchenette for a healthly breakfast and the designer inroom coffee was a bonus.

I can say that this particular stay was probably my worst. I still managed to have a good time, but no part of that was due to my stay at Trump. The basics... Pros: Hotel lobby is nice. Staff is friendly (even when not competent, they were all very friendly). Room was relatively clean and well appointed. Location is decent. Not on the Strip, but close enough. Easy to cut through Nordstrom's and the mall during business hours, otherwise a short walk. Cons: EVERYTHING ELSE. No really, everything else was horrible. Check-in at 3 pm? Not cool. We arrived tired after a drive from LA at a little before 11 am and were told a room wouldn't be available until 3. \"Can you please check or call me sooner?\" Nope, turns out they couldn't, or they wouldn't. It wasn't too much to ask either. Just call my cell when a room comes up, and I'll be back. The person who greeted me, who obviously wasn't paying attention or didn't care, actually suggested I wait in the restaurant. For over four hours. With a five year old. Really, lady? I kept checking in and finally got in at around 2:30. I have never, ever in the history of staying in Vegas not gotten a room within an hour of arriving, tops. And that's rare to even wait. Resort fee? Only \"resort\" with five stars that charges such a fee. If Bellagio doesn't charge a fee, neither should you, Trump. Other hotels? Venetian, Wynn, Ceasars, all have better facilities and don't charge on top of their regular room rates. A swimming pool and one restaurant does not make one a resort, my friend. We've stayed in resorts in other cities. Recently, in fact. The ones that charge such fees (justifiably so) include things like internet access. Unlike Trump, who charges $12 on top of the $17 resort fee. Pool? One of the biggest duds of all the Vegas pools I've experienced. Pool staff was friendly, but two drinks took twenty minutes to arrive and cost $20 (one wasn't even alcoholic). Train? Loud. Yeah, it's loud. Maybe it's not loud from certain parts of the hotel, but from our room, it was loud. Room? Relatively clean, but my poor kid went into a sneezing fit when he picked up the tv remote from the shelf below the crookedly mounted tv. Layer of dust that was thick. Had to call for maintenance twice. Once the jets in the tub didn't work (and the worker left a caulk gun, a spare tub sensor - they apparently go out often - in the room), and the second time because the TV in the bathroom wouldn't turn OFF. Valet? Probably the worst aspect of a crappy stay. When I first arrived, instead of informing me that check-in wasn't for hours, they happily took my car. I walked in with my bags and was told no check in, so I left the bags with the bell desk and went back outside. It would be nice if someone communicates with the valet stand so they can let people know that they may not be able to check in. And then I waited ten minutes for my car. Which, mercifully, was the shortest wait time at valet for my trip. The longest? Almost 30 minutes. No joke. In fact, the icing on the cake was when we were finally leaving (and happily leaving) and I commented to my better half at how happy I was to not deal with the valet anymore - a valet steps out of a car and says my last name. \"Uh, that's me. That's not my car.\" You guessed it, another five minutes after the fifteen we were already waiting while he went searching for the correct car. I think in the two days we stayed at this hotel, I spent a cumulative hour and a half waiting in front of the hotel for the car. Minimum. They need to just allow self parking. I understand this valet service is part of that fantastical \"resort fee\", but is it really worthwhile when it's this much of a hassle? When the staff at the desk told me to go wait in the restaurant (four hours, with a child, natch), my gut screamed out, \"Grab your bags and drive across the street to one of the hotels you've enjoyed in the past. Just do it. Eat the cost of this hotel stay, it's not that much. You won't regret it.\" I decided to go against my gut and give the hotel another chance. I should have gone with my gut.

They said someone would be up within ten minutes. That never happened. Forty minutes later, I called again. This time someone came up quickly and fixed everything. However at this point, we were fed up and wanted to leave. I went downstairs to speak with the manager. The manager looked into our reservation and said because we prepaid through a travel agency, he could not cancel and refund the balance of our stay. He generously offered us a $100 food & beverage credit and an upgrade to a corner suite. The corner suite was spectacular with many views of the strip and of the desert all the way out to Red Rock Canyon. Unfortunately, all the lampshades were broken and two light bulbs were out. We mentioned the light bulbs. They were never replaced. Another annoying problem was that there were very, very few outlets in the suite. In order to both plug in my laptop and have a surface on which to place it, I had to unplug a phone and move the dining table and chairs. The first day, the wi-fi connection seemed spotty so I got an ethernet cable and used that. (Either costs $11.99 per day.) That seemed to help. However on the day before we left, when I tried to connect using the ethernet, I got a message that the Trump server was down. The same thing happened when I tried to use the wi-fi to connect. I called downstairs and was told the IT guy was not yet in. I was told I should call Cox, Trump's cable provider, to deal with it. The LAST thing I am going to do when traveling is to kill an hour or more dealing with the hotel's internet problems. People should also be aware that there is no self-park at the Trump. You must use the valet and when things got busy, there were long delays in getting the car. With cool temperatures and very cold, very high winds, that got uncomfortable. At least Trump provides free shuttle service to the Strip and to the shops at Caesar's Palace. Other annoyances: a glass of regular, white wine at the bar costs $15.00. A 20-ounce bottle of soda at the store, (there are no vending machines), costs $3.00. Thank goodness for the fridges in the rooms, because at those prices, people were stuffing them.

There is a sofa, 2 chairs, coffee table and end table. Very nice to have this area since we were here for 5 days. The room has a kitchen area with a stove, small frig, sink and microwave.

Was very deep and had many jets. There was a TV screen built into the mirror. I had never seen anything quite like it. You couldn't feel it, but the picture would come on the middle of the large mirror. Perfect for watching during a long bath. You really could live in this studio room and feel right at home. Wouldn't change a thing about the room. Housekeeping was a little lax for such a nice hotel.Didn't replace shower caps or lotion. Put newspaper by a full small trash can and they never picked them up for 5 days. Toothpaste on the bathroom mirror didn't get cleaned and there was a knife left on the floor.How can you vacumn a floor a miss a knife? I called one day at 5 pm because there was no hot water. An hour later I called again.FInally someone got back to me and told me the problem. and it was so resolved. Comunicate with guests and we will understand. Ingore us and we get cranky!! Pool area was nice with attentive staff. We didn't eat in the resturant but the BLT from room service and by the pool was the best I had every had. On the other hand room service tortolini was terrible.Very tough and no rolls or accompaniments . They hadn't put a current room service menu in our room so ordering dinner was quite an ordel. Had a body scub in the spa and it was great. The spa staff was super. You can spend all day there if you have a treatment. Wonderful products. I got a very good haircut in the salon. The biggest drawback for us was the location. It is 15 minute walk to the closet casino and a LOOOOONG way to the other end of the strip. We had to take cabs to the Rio to see a show and to the MGM. Because of traffic, it cost about $15 each way We took a cab one night to the Bellagio to see the Fontains and they weren't on because of high winds. It was always wonderful to come back to the elegant lobby. i wish I could get that fragrance for my house. Not like perfume, just delightfully fresh. I would recommend the hotel, but only of you are ready to walk A LOT (really) if you want to go to shows or casinos.

Apparently, the advertised two beds actually included a fold-out couch. When we phoned the front desk, they told us the only way to get two real beds was to upgrade to a penthouse suite at considerable additional cost. When housekeeping made up the sofa bed, it had a thin sheet with no quilt or comforter, and I had to sleep and shiver all night directly by an air conditioning vent. The sofa was quite uncomfortable and very small - at my height, my feet were hanging off the end! I imagine the Trump could respond with \"buyer beware\" and say that I should have known that this was a business suite, but it wasn't possible for me to know this since the hotel was sprung on me by Priceline. I noted above that the Priceline scam charges weren't the Trump's fault, but what is their fault is that they're associated with Priceline at all.

Mr. Deal took us to P3 level where our car was parked (as TRUMP has no self parking), through an \u201cemployee only\u201d elevator to see our car. We took pictures of our car.

Finally, he said he can ask their hotel manager to talk to us if we are still upset. As Mr. Deal is very polite and makes sure TRUMP will pay for the car repair, and we think since it is Christmas holidays, we do not want to spend more time dealing with this unpleasant event. After we came back from the trip, we took our car to our insurance company, ALLSTATE, to report the accident and got an estimate for $998. We had our car fixed in January. Then ALLSTATE sent out the claim to TRUMP on 1/20. On 2/17, my insurance company ALLSTATE informed me that TRUMP refused to pay for the repair, since we gave our key to them, which means we are willing to let them operate our car, WE have to be obligated to pay for the repair.

I did not open the doors of the hotel during my entire visit -- not once. Every time I entered or exited the property a door man was opening the door. The front desk staff was wonderful and efficient at both check-in and check-out. Every time I called for something, the person who answered the phone was not only polite, but went the extra mile. For instance, I called for some extra coffee, and I was asked if I wanted regular cream or hazelnut cream. Such detail! One time I stepped out of my room with my ice bucket, and a staff member in the hallway happened to see me. He went and got the ice for me. Room service staff was similarly stellar. The room was incredible -- HUGE, with fantastic modern classic style and loads of luxury. The bed was awesome. There was a couch, two chairs, and coffee table. A full desk. 2 closets. Kitchenette with Wolf and Sub Zero appliances. Huge jacuzzi tub. Walk-in shower. TV built into the bathroom mirror. And THE NICEST towels and robe I've ever had at a hotel. This place is a real retreat, but I also got a ton of work done (and the high-speed internet worked really well). LOTS of the Vegas hotels have nice rooms, but this room stood out for its size AND for its real quality; this wasn't \"fake\" luxury meant to impress the Vegas weekenders. And the elegance, while ever-present, was far more understated than I anticipated knowing that The Donald was involved! The hotel's public spaces are also really well done. The fitness center was great (cold towels are even provided) -- large with lots of equipments and a full range of free weights and machines. The lobby is spacious. Everything is top-notch. Best of all, thanks to not hosting a casino, this place actually feels like a hotel lobby where you could have a conversation with a co-worker, do some work, etc. My only complaint (and a minor one): the valet retrieval could be a bit on the slow side. Overall, HIGHLY recommended, especially for people who want proximity to the strip (the hotel's a short walk from the Wynn, Treasure Island, Encore, etc., and a brief cab ride to all the others) without having to deal with the hassles of the casino strip properties. How refreshing to have the excitement of Vegas just steps away but to not have to walk through a casino to get to your room, deal with stumbling drunk people, be able to grab coffee in the morning without huge lines everywhere, etc. There are times where the strip properties work, but this is definitely my choice for a business hotel in Vegas.

We had 4 girls per room so having two bathrooms was very convenient. The room d\u00e9cor was nice, nothing too fancy. For the price we paid the value was great! I also liked the Fashion Show Mall being across the street from the hotel- Go to the Nordstrom\u2019s Caf\u00e9 for lunch. On the not so great side, the hotel is off the strip- they offer a free shuttle to the strip that runs on a regular basis. The hotel doesn\u2019t have a casino!!!!! REALLY- I guess the tower was supposed to be condos, but with the real estate market crash it was converted to hotel. So, if you want to gamble you need to go elsewhere. It was very windy the weekend we were there, and the rooms did not muffle the noise or wind. I felt like I was in a wind tunnel while walking the hotel\u2019s hallways. The train noise was also annoying!!! The windows are very thin and the noise goes through them like paper. The gym was OK, nothing to brag about! It had free weights, cardio machines and some nautilus machines. An adequate gym is very important to me, and this one did not cut it. I didn\u2019t eat at the hotel restaurant, but I did order a fruit plate at the caf\u00e9 next to the gym- not worth my money. And for some reason, the staff was not pleasant at the caf\u00e9. The hotel was not crowded; check in & out was smooth. There was no bar scene, or party atmosphere- the hotel was pretty mellow. The pool was not exciting or worth mentioning. Overall it was a good value for the money we paid. Would I stay in the property again?

I found a sweet deal on TravelZoo for $99/night (on a weekend) plus $50 resort credit. We rented a car this time in Vegas because we wanted to see some of the sights outside of the city, and we foound the valet parking to be very courteous, quick and convenient. Upon check-in, the extremely friendly and professional gentleman at the front desk asked if we would like to upgrade from a city-view room to a strip-view. I told him it was not necessary, to which he replied, \"Yes, the mountains are beautiful with the snow on them.\" (It had snowed the night before). He completed the check-in process, we went to our room, and to our pleasant surprise, we had a view of the strip! I should back up to say that the lobby smells wonderful! I wish I could buy scent they pump into the lobby. Also, it was very pleasant to stay in a hotel with no casino, and more importantly, no smoking. Don't get me wrong, we do like to gamble some and experience Vegas all that Vegas has to offer, but it was very nice to have a sanctuary to return to after a day/night of craziness. The room was tastefully decorated, the bed and linens were luxurious, and the location was convenient. It was just a short walk to the strip and all of the popular hotels and fantastic shopping were just a 10-15 minute walk away. And, if we were too lazy to walk, (or too drunk to drive) we could just hop in a cab and get anywhere for just a few bucks. The spa products in the bathroom were fabulous! The shampoo reminded me of scents from my childhood. The best way I can describe it is a pleasant mix of sage and sweet pea. I wish I had purchased the large bottle in the gift shop. We used our resort credit at DJT and purchased the Pre Fixe dinner. It was delicious, and the atmosphere was top-notch. The Frisse salad was fantastic! The last night of our trip, we were craving Indian food, and received a great recommendation from the concierge. She even showed us an ad in a travel guide for a free dinner at the restaurant. Finally, as a gay couple, the resort staff made us feel welcome, and we did not feel out of place in any way.

We planned on celebrating 2 birthdays and also my bachelorette party. We were awed by the very spacious and smoke free lobby and rooms of the hotel...also, the plush robes and jacuzzi bathtub. We took advantage of the convenient shuttle service that seemed to be always available without ever having to wait. All was going extremely smoothly until the very last night of our stay. The night of the poor security incident we got back from our evening out at around 2:30am and crashed in the super comfy bed and sofa sleeper by 3am. About an hour later at around 4:30am I heard someone trying to use their key to gain entry into our room. They tried unsuccessfully several times and then finally gave up and left. I was wide awake by that point and a bit worried considering that person actually was able to gain access into the foyer area by using their key on the first door which leads to the 2 separate rooms. I laid in bed for about 5 minutes and then heard the person trying to use their key on the door again!!!! This time the key actually worked and the person was able to open the door!!!!! Thankfully, the hotel door guard was secured on the top of the door and the person was only able to open the door a couple of inches. I proceeded to ask them why they were trying to get into our room since only all 3 of our names were listed on the room reservation. They told me their name and their friend's name that \"should\" be in the room. Neither one of my friends, nor myself, recognized either one of the names provided and let this person know. Then this person asked me, \"Are you sure?\" I then told this person to leave and that I was going to call security. After arguing with me about whether or not their friend was in the room they FINALLY left. I decided to call the front desk first. The front desk attendant said they would call security for me and get the door lock reprogrammed and new keys reissued. Then a few minutes later security called our room to let me know there was a \"mistake\" and the security guard was on his way with new keys for our room. About an hour later we heard the security guard enter the foyer area and then saw them slip an envelope with new keys under the door!!! No one at Trump (security or front desk attendant) attempted to apologize for the inconvenience or even ask about what happened...none of the staff members at Trump seemed to even find this occurence to be out of the ordinary at all. While checking out a few hours later, I talked to the manager and explained how alarmed we were that obviously the front desk reissued a key to someone without verifying the names on our reservation or this person's identification! Of course, the front desk attendant and the manager did not see any record of this occurrence on our reservation file. I then went on to explain how we all lost sleep and felt extremely upset and fearful that just about anyone off the street could gain access into our room. The manager FINALLY apologized and issued us a $50 guest inconvenience credit. Cheap if you ask me... Just to let everyone know that may be reading this, from what I experienced, you don't even need to bother with making a reservation at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. You can simply go to the front desk, pick a room number and ask for a room key and you have a free place to stay!

What an incredible delight it was to stay at this hotel. From the stunning decor to the lovely and helpful staff, this establishment exceeded all of our expectations. When we arrived at the Trump Tower, the valet was kind and talkative. He wanted to know where we were from and if we were in town for business or leisure. It was nice and made us feel like the staff were generally interested in us. The doorman was very sweet and offered to help us with our luggage. The lobby smells simply delightful! I'm not sure what it is, but the entire lobby smells like a spa. It's a lovely change from the smokiness that pervades most of the hotels in Vegas. The staff at the front desk was more than accommodating and upgraded us to a one bedroom suite. There are security guards at the elevators, which is a nice touch and something I think is a good idea for all hotels of this scale. The room was simply stunning. We had a full kitchen, a delightful living room and sitting area, a spacious bedroom with fantastic floor to ceiling windows and the bathroom was just spectacular. The bathroom has marble floors and counter tops, a private commode, a lovely deep spa tub sitting in a window with a breathtaking view of the strip and an enormous glass and marble shower. There is a small tv in the bathroom mirror as well, his and hers closets in the bedroom, an iphone/ipod docking station and large plasma tv's in both the living room and the bedroom. The views from the suite were magnificent! The room was clean and neat. The bedding was soft and comfortable. We did not want for anything! I have read some of the other reviews on this site and didn't think any of the commonly addressed issues were really a problem. You can hear a train occasionally from the hotel, but it isn't as loud as some seem to say it is. We barely noticed it at all. As far as the hotel being 'far' from anything, I have to say that I think some people just like to complain. The hotel is literally a stone's throw from Fashion Show mall and all you have to do is walk across the street to the double doors at Nordstrom to enjoy a nice stroll through the mall to get to the strip by day. At night, there is a paved road leading right to the strip that is about a block in length. I would hardly call a block a long walk, but for those in their Jimmy Choo's, the Trump offers a shuttle service from their door right down to the strip and as you are walking out of the hotel the doormen and valet's are constantly inviting guests who are walking to the strip to board the shuttle. Overall, this is one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed at. We enjoyed every moment that we spent here and would not hesitate to return or to recommend this hotel to anyone!

First- I will address the cons that people have listed previously...namely trains and location. Trains- I will preface this by saying I am a light sleeper. The only time that I heard a train at all was when I was laying by the tranquil pool one afternoon. I slept soundly all night long EVERY night I was there. It is rare for me to sleep so well at a hotel just due to the fact that slight noises with plumping or hall noise will always disturb me. I was thrilled with the quiet that was provided in our suite. Location- no, not ON strip but it was an easy 20 minute stroll (through a pleasant and SAFE area) to the HEART of the strip- only 4-5 minutes to Las Vegas Blvd. Parking- valet got busy on weekends but it was still a very easy experience. RESORT FEE- yes, there will be an additional $15 fee tacked on to your bill EVEN if you book through an online site that usually is an \"all fees included\" site. Its just the way it is...that said, unlike other hotels, they do not then go on to charge each guest for use of the fitness center or pool etc. And now for the PROS- we loved that it was a non-smoking property and that there was NO CASINO in the hotel (some people may find these aspects cons, to us it was delightful). These aspects made it quieter and more refined than even the nicest strip hotels. SUITES- each room has a kitchenette- we were able to call the concierge to get any pots/pans that we needed. This way we were able to make breakfast every morning we wanted to as well as any other meal we wanted. Appliances are sub-zero/bosch (top line) as are the pans. The facts that housekeeping took care of pots/dishes really was the icing on the cake. Bathrooms- I could not have imagined how much I would enjoy having a TV in the mirror of the bathroom (so you can watch while getting ready OR while soaking in the huge jacuzzi tub). Concierge- very helpful...from suggesting a great shop for getting new boots to helping plan evening shows (I would suggest making use of the buy one get one offer Trump hotel has for the cirque show Mystere- not sure if this is an ongoing offer but we LOVED the show and using the trump offer got one ticket free!)

Classy, well appointed, well run. Some wrote that the only downsides were that its not right on the strip and no Casino. To us those are absolute upsides! As non-smokers (and not really gamblers either) it was a pleasure to come into a facility that was non-smoking and did not have the REEK of american cigarettes and booze like so many other hotels on the strip. It was a refreshing escape from the loud obnoxiousness of LV Strip. We were only here for a few days diversion on our way through to LA. LV is not our kind of place in any case, and I would not choose this as a destination. Fake fake fake this is a town of smoke (yeah, literally...tons of smoke...) and mirrors. If you are into the debauchery of sin city and are an addict of any kind, (drinker, smoker, gambler, sex addict) then you will think you've gone to heaven. Ok, if we had to make one negative observation we would agree with the 'noise' factor and trains and thin windows/insulation. But overall a small price to pay for the rest of what was a very pleasurable experience. Nice beds, quality sheets, beautifully designed/appointed rooms with many nice amenities. Our room was on the 43rd floor had a view of the mountains and strip. The double doors from the hallway provides extra security and reduces ANY noise from the hallway area. Sub zero fridge a great amenity for cold bevies. Resort fee is charged everywhere in almost every hotel so that is not unusual. When we arrived we could not find the TV remote in the room so they eventually had someone sent up and they provided another remote - took about 25 minutes but finally arrived. The TV in the bathroom did not work, but really we did not miss it, after all we weren't here to watch TV. Stayed at some other hotels on the strip and although they all present well on the internet, the reality is far different. Most of the hotels (ie: NYNY amongst others) are sticky, dirty and by the time you walk to lobby reception (through the open smokey casino) you need a shower to get the smoke out of your clothes and hair.

The second night I heard the first train at 3:45 AM. Ok let me discuss a few things. Resort Fee-Total Ripoff. I was told at the front desk it included internet. At checkout I was told it did not. I had nothing in writing telling me what it covered so there was nothing I could do. Cost me an extra $36.00 that I might not have used if I knew I had to pay. Free Vaket parking? I did not have a car but no hotel in vegas charges for parking. The gym was ok,with a number of problems with the touch screens on treadmills. My room had stained carpet and the hip tv in the bathroom not working. There was a tray of dirty dishes outside in the hall near my room for three days. That must be a record. I have a nice picture of that. Plenty of people housekeeping and other employees must have walked by it and did not bother picking it up. (probably the not my job stuff) Spoke to a few people on the way to the airport they had plenty of probems with bathtub problems etc. They train woke them up as well. Some employees friendly and others were pretty chilly. Due to the train noise this is just not worth the hassle. The walk to the strip is not great either. Its a little seedy and the only thing I can say is that it is not like walking a few bloacks to the vegas strip from most other areas.

The bed was great too. I am being absolutely honest when I say that I DID NOT hear any noise from the train, helicopters etc. NOT AT ALL! I guess the location of your room definitely has something to do with it. We actually went to sleep around midnight since my husband had a cold and was not feeling well on two of the nights that we were there. We even got an extended complimentary checkout (6pm) because our flight did not leave until 9 and I had mentioned to the girl at the front desk that he was ill. She was really nice and told us to stay a few extra hours so we wouldn't be uncomfortable at the airport. I was truly amazed by that. Oh, one thing I would like to also address is the whole walk to the strip being unsafe. We cut through the mall (Nordstrom is directly across the street) during the day. At night we would take a cab back to the hotel. One night while at the Wynn, we did walk back to the hotel and I agree it is not safe because of the lack of sidewalk.

This was by far the worst experience of them all. We arrived, checked in and told the front desk it was our anniversary and mentioned that we were worried about what we had read on Trip Advisor regarding the train and helicopter noise. They put us on the 50th floor away from the train track and they told us that although they do get complaints regarding the noise, it's not that bad and we'd be in the best possible place to avoid the noise. So far so good. We went to our room and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. As described by other posts here it was very nice inside and had a kitchen, 2 bathrooms, etc. Two issues with the room was that 1) the safe didn't work and 2) there were 5-10 sticky hand prints on the windows as the windows had obviously not been cleaned. So far, we were still happy. We certainly don't expect perfection, the safe and windows can be fixed / cleaned and overall the room seemed nice. I issue started when we went to bed. The constant stream of helicopter fly bys and trains passing were VERY loud. I am hearing impaired and the train even woke me up at 4am. Now, If you are a person who can get woken up by a train in the middle of the night and go back to sleep, this is not a problem but this is not the case for my wife (and others who post on Trip Advisor). We made our first call to the front desk and we were told that they had a quitter room, but they would have to charge us $40 more a night for it. We asked the front desk how often the train goes by and were told \"We don't have a train schedule\". We called again much later to see if there was anything else they could do (i.e. move us to a different room) and we were told that it wouldn't help, we had the best possible room for sound. So at this point we've called twice, we've basically be told that there is nothing that can be done. We had a mostly sleepless night and decided to see what our other options were elsewhere. We left the hotel at 6:30am and as described on a lot of the other reviews on this site, the walk to the strip when the mall is closed is dirty, dangerous, and down right crummy. There are no side walks between the hotel and the strip and all the surrounding area is under construction. Once we got to the strip, we checked out a few other locations and got the Palazzo for about the same money we were paying at the Trump. As a side comment - we stayed at the Palazzo and while sitting in our room a helicopter flew by our window and we heard nothing. I'm not an engineer, but my guess is that the Palzzo just bought better sound proof glass. When we checked out from the Trump, the manager said he was sorry and then offered up the upgraded room for free (the one that the previous two people said they had to charge us for). It was pretty annoying that we had to say we were checking out early for them to actually address the issue we had. Very inconsistent messaging. Overall, I think the hotel was ok inside, but I don't understand how The Trump management can expect to run a \"5 Star\" hotel in that terrible location with all the noise and poor accessibility to the Strip. I read a bunch of reviews on Trip Advisor before I went and I thought \"whatever, these complaints about the train noise and locations are just outliers written by complainers\", but I was very wrong. When we were checking out another couple asked us why we were leaving for another hotel and we mentioned the train noise. The lady in the couple agreed that she had heard the noise and that it woke her up several times, but being woken up a few times a night was ok them. So I guess it comes down to whether you are a light sleeper or not, but I honestly don't think that this is something you should have to think about when you are paying for a 5 Star hotel in Vegas.

The rooms were standard, smaller than we expected and very plain, boring decor, no character to the room whatsoever. The kitchenette was tiny but did the job for breakfast although there was nothing to really cook with, we called house-keeping for a frying pan which they did bring us eventually. The bathroom was nice. Location is off the strip which was fine during the day as you can cut through the fashion mall which was very nice. The mall closes at 10pm so it is worth getting a taxi back after that to the hotel as it quite a long walk from the strip and the street the hotel is located on is not very well lit.

There's a great view on Treasure Island an the Palazzo and the Wynn. The walk to the strip is a bit further as the hotel location is off strip. But we're used to some walking as we are European. We found the gift shop awfully expensive but that was to be expected. (thought to buy a bathrobe as we liked it, But for $150 our money found a wiser destination) The elevator is something else. We never travelled from ground floor to the 37th floor in 8 seconds flat! We didn't get a chance to actually use the fitness room but after a look inside it looked great. The staff at the pool was very friendly. Did not need any other staff so no ratings there. There's no casino in this hotel so the only people inside are the ones that actually stay there.

However, having just come back it is absolutely ABSURD what some people complain about. Heres what I can say about some of the comments and my experience. The train: Give me a break! Really\u2026 people saying they lost sleep over it is ridiculous. I think I can remember hearing it about 2 times at most at night, and we were on the 24th floor. Didn't bother me at all. Beds: The beds were extremely comfortable, as it has a down feather mattress pad, and down feather pillows with comfy sheets. Bathroom: The spa tub with jets and separate shower were GREAT added ammenities, not to mention the tv in the bathroom mirror. Its also comical to read how people complain about build up on the shower head. I didn't have my magnifying glass to inspect mine but my shower was great with plenty of hot water! In regards to slippery floors\u2026.they do provide not 1 but TWO towels mats of sufficient size to put on the floor for when you step out of the shower, so you don\u2019t slip. Pool: I was pleased to find that the pool was heated given the 60 degree weather. The service at the pool was also very good. They greet you as you walk in and guide you to a chair or what I would say is a love seat for two, and lay out your towels for you. Valet: So, yes this hotel does not have self parking but the complimentary valet was a great and convenient added bonus. My husband and I never had to wait more than 5 minutes to drop off our car, as the staff all worked very hard to meet everyones\u2019 needs. At times when people were waiting to pick up their cars, management went out of their way to bring people water while they waited. I don\u2019t think having to wait a few minutes is that big of a deal, or having to tip a few dollars is also that big of a deal. However, a suggestion I would have is just in case you are leaving during a high peak time (dinner reservations, or to catch a show) give yourself a few minutes extra to allow yourself time to get your car. Perhaps if traveling with a group the one who is ready first can go down a few minutes earlier to give the valet the ticket. In regards to walking to the mall, you just have to use caution when crossing the street like anywhere else. Resort fee: Yes, there is a resort fee of $15.00/day\u2026.but many of the hotels in Vegas also have a resort fee. With that said I think the Trump Hotel is a fabulous establishment, with incredible customer service, beautiful rooms and bathroom. I loved the fact that there is no casino and no smoking. This would be a great place for expectant mothers looking to go to Vegas without having to be around all of the smoke. Readers take everything with a grain of salt. I feel that too many people are a little too anxious to post any slight negative feedback they encounter. The Trump Hotel like any other hotel or establishment is not perfect, and things are bound to go wrong from time to time, but I don\u2019t feel that people should hold those things against a truly great establishment.

I really did not expect that I would have to write this review. Upon entering the hotel, it smelled fresh and clean, unlike that of the Casino/Hotels.....but that experience was short-lived.

The room smelled like an old Motel 6 room. Yuck!! And the worst part? I unpacked my clothes when I got home and they wreak even worse than I thought!! The showerhead was a cheap shower head with lime deposits on it. We didn't find the bed to be as comfortable as we have experienced in other hotels.

The doors to the shower and commode were difficult and a bit scary to maneuver...always had to make sure it didn't slam closed. The safe jammed and we had to have someone called up to release it so we could use our computer. Everytime we went out, our key cards would demagnatize which we would not find out until we got to our room, in which case we would have to go back to the lobby and have them re-keyed. The explanation was that their keys do that when you put them near other credit cards, cell phones, etc....Every hotel I have stayed in has these key cards and we have never had this problem before. I did address this with the manager the second night we were there and she blamed the key situation on us since we shouldn't put it near our credit cards, etc....and \"it happens\". Secondly she just suggested that they send someone up to ionize our room for us. She did give us our resort fees back which was a total of $30. I have been in the service industry for many years.

There is no doubt that this hotel targets a certain clientele. Some of the issues people complain about are SO ridiculous. The Trump is an all suites hotel, very much the same as the Signature Suites. So yes folks, like the Signature, Trump does not have a minibar. Do you honestly enjoy paying three times the amount for your beer and gin? Instead, you have a refrigerator that you are free to stock with your own food and beverage. I did find the dishes and cooking utensils a bit lacking, but I am not looking to make any big meals. It was just fine for cheese and crackers we enjoyed. There is no casino at this hotel. Well, duh!! Trump does not advertise a casino, and given the Donald is trying to sell his gambling properties in Atlantic City, why would you assume he wanted a gambling property in Vegas. And here is a news flash for all gamblers: you may want to stay clear of Aria, Vdara, Veer, and the Mandarin Oriental, as they are all not gaming. Since about 2007, the major corporations that own the strip properties, have generated more revenues from their non-gambling activities than from gambling. Do some basic research people. The walk from Trump to the strip is scary?! Are you freaking kidding me?! I agree it is poorly lit for a night walk, but simply assuming vehicles do not see you will keep you safe. There is lots of cars and foot traffic. We never felt frightened. In the daytime, we crossed the street and entered the mall and made the \"long\" three minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd in air-conditioned comfort. It is no different than walking along Harmon Ave if you are staying at the Signature Suites. Come on folks, a short walk can only help after you have come from the buffet. Train noise. No doubt about it, you do hear trains. They just did not keep me from my sleep. Its not like there is a train every hour, maybe a couple overnight--or else I just slept through them. The staff is among the friendliest we have encountered in Vegas. And DJT (restaurant) is an outstanding value. The prix fixe menu is a three course for $29. People, stop complaining about having to tip the valet guy a couple of dollars for parking. Are you kidding me?! Have you ever stayed at a hotel in NYC or San Francisco and had to pay the daily parking rate? Everytime you drop the valet guy two bucks, pretend you won $30 that covered your parking. If you spend 14 hours a day at the tables on your trips to Vegas, this is NOT the hotel for you. You should be getting your room comped! If you are looking for a beautiful hotel that offers you a quiet retreat after a day on the strip, this IS the place for you.

Upon arrival around midnight at the hotel, we asked if we would like to upgrade from a standard room to a roomier corner suite with view of the Strip. We don't usually opt for an upgrade of this type but decided to treat ourselves. We arrived at our \"uprgrade\" to find that the suite had never been serviced and was littered with trash, dirty towels, and used room service items. A quick call to the Front Desk brought a promise that someone would come up to quickly meet us with new key cards and move us to our new room. The minutes ticked by as we sat in this unkept room, and I finally called down to the Front Desk again. After 20 minutes (now 12:30 am!) the Front Desk Manager met us, apologized, and moved us to our new room. He offered to comp the first night's upgrade, which was honestly the least he could do in the circumstances. Having worked in travel industry for 15 years, I would have comped the entire upgrade given the situation. Of course, the new room didn't have the view we had been promised when paying for the upgrade and in fact was fully exposed to the horrific train noise you will read about in multiple reviews. This despite the fact that we were on the 47th Floor! NOTES: The shower in the master bath did not drain property and ensured that your feet enjoyed a dirty water and soap scum frappe during and well after your shower. The large glass doors used to enter the toliet and to a lesser extent the shower are not unwieldy, but downright dangerous. This is especially the case when you are trying to step up or down entering or leaving the shower with wet feet. Lawsuits waiting to happen...or perhaps already happened? There is no minibar in the units. The full kitchen is not well stocked with glassware and plates. The well-heated pool and fitness center were quite nice.

We particularly liked the small vestibule between each pair of rooms and the corridor. It made for very limited noise transmission from other guests.

The bathroom was totally luxurious and spotless, from the extra large jacuzzi tub to the glass stalled shower. My only gripe would be the internet charges. At $11.99 per 24hr period I think this is absurd, especially when the majority of hotels do not charge for this. My husband and I both had our laptops (work purposes) and for a 2 night stay we ended up paying around $50 for the internet as they charge PER LAPTOP!!!!! We had one dinner in the restaurant, DJT, and whilst I found my meal unsatisfactory, my husband actually enjoyed his. I chose chicken which was so dry it was reminiscent of wood. However, our hostess, Bethany, was quick to resolve the problem and indeed offered me an alternative entree without making me feel as if I was a problem. She was magnificent. Whilst chatting with her me and my husband found her to be efficient, courteous and brimming over with information about the Trump brand. Don't get me wrong she was not selling the brand, my husband was just asking general questions and she knew her stuff...... we were impressed, good for her!

If you want one, you can go to one. If you must have one in your hotel, well then, stay elsewhere. Didn't try any of the restaurants. Prices at the spa are obscene, even with our included spa credit, unfathomable. The gym was somewhat small, but decent...didn't use it. The pool was alright, rooftop style about half way up the building, but it was only about 4 feet at its deepest point. DJ kinda sucked, but it was def the club/party type scene with beautiful people getting good and toasty. Room: OMG, this is what it's about. You get a fridge, microwave, ipod dock, and best of all a hot tub! Fit both of us, I am big, she is not. The in mirror TV was alright, but hard to see from the tub. The bed was amazing comfy and the robes almost came home with us. They do this private entrance thing with a foyer for two adjacent rooms. It was pretty cool and probably reduced some hall noise. So clean, elegant, and perfect! Service: Well you pay $15/day for it, so I guess it was pretty good. We didn't have any problems, so I guess that is cool. There is only a valet option, so I guess it all balances out with the complimentary valet service. They did bring out free shots for the people at the pool though and it seemed like everyone got them except for us. They just kept skipping around us. Location: Well, its a bit off the strip. There is not much immediately by there. The Wynn is down the street as well as the mall with some decent looking restaurants. There are some liquor stores and pharmacies a few VERY long blocks away, but nothing too close. Although it was easy enough to just drive down to the casinos, park for free and walk around, it was kind of a pain to deal with traffic and parking every time we wanted to go somewhere and there is not much at the hotel itself. If you are drinking, you will have to take a lot of very expensive cabs around because there is not much to do there. Value: This place was perfect for us and really served our purposes. Considering its a 5 star, we got a ridiculous deal online for just about $79/night. When you factor in the $15/day though, it could be less of a good deal at times. The rooms were just too good to be true though. I absolutely would stay at this place again, especially if I could get it for less than $100/night before the resort fee.

We booked by naming our price on Priceline.com and ended up with this hotel. At first, I wasn't happy with what I got due to its \"off-strip\" location...but then, I knew when I use Priceline, you get what you get, so can't really complain. When we arrived at the hotel, the doormen greeted us -- nice touch, reminscent of the 5* service I have gotten in Asian luxury hotels. The lobby is beautiful, sparkling and smells really nice. I think they pump in some really nice scent through the lobby. Check-in was a breeze. I signed some form acknowledging the $15 resort fee. Priceline hadn't included this detail during the booking; but luckily, the TA reviews had clued me in to the $15. We got a city view room on the 53rd floor, as I had asked during check-in for a room where I could not really hear the train noise. Front desk informed me I'd have to upgrade (meaning, pay extra) to face strip view or give me a higher up floor. I took the latter, which didn't really eliminate the train noise but it was less loud (I heard it in the middle of the night, but my husband didn't). The room was beautiful and well furnished. The small kitchenette had top-end appliances (Wolff, Bosch) and small appliances (Cuisinart), and even the kettle was a Le Creuset. The bed was most comfy with a nice duvet. The bathroom was luxurious with a giant jacuzzi tub, huge shower stall, and lots of marble. Nice towels and a good supply of it. Housekeeping was good at clean-up. We had no issues. During the course of our stay, I have only a few complaints: 1. On our first morning, we had to have a cold shower. That was brutal. When we mentioned the cold shower morning at check-out, they acknowledged that they did have a problem that morning with the water and we weren't the only ones to complain. 2. The location. It is off the strip, though you can easily walk the long block to get to the strip, or go through Nordstrom's at the Fashion Show Mall (only during opening hours though). My husband and I didn't have a problem with the walk as we are healthy and typically walk a lot to wherever we like to go. But this may be a problem for those who have mobility issues. The location is also a problem if we wanted to get to the Bellagio or Caesars fast. That would've taken us about 30-45 min. 3. Not great dining choices at Trump LV. Only one restaurant that looked overly pricey and not quite casual enough. Wished there could be more choices. 4. The train noise for light sleepers (like me). Though my husband didn't hear it at all. I suggest a high floor, as high as you can get. 5. The daily resort fee. I don't like this hidden fee. Why don't the hotels build it into the nightly room rate? 6. The low-end bathroom soaps. I was surprised at the poor quality. It really dried out my skin, and made it red and itchy. And I don't even have sensitive skin. If you do have sensitive skin, make sure you bring your own soap. What we really liked: 1. The nice smelling lobby we came back to in the evenings. Coming from Canada where smoking is banned indoors and a required distance from the outside entrances, we found the smoking smell to be overwhelming in the casinos. It was nice to come back to a smoke-free zone. 2. The fitness room. Very nice atmosphere to work out in. Great equipment. 3. The service. Really friendly and attentive. 4. The 4pm late check-out, with no extra fees. Nice touch. 5. The beautiful room. It was in top condition, no worn out couches or carpet tears or poor quality linens/towels. It was all good. 6. The Wolfgang Puck coffee packs in the room. 7. The bed. We had some nice sleeps. 8. The security. There was guy who would check our room keys before we could hop onto an elevator to go to our room.

Checking in was a breeze and we even got \"Happy New Year\" hats at the front desk. The entire staff was courteous during my stay, and the doormen were especially polite. Our room was on the 22nd floor offering a city view as opposed to the strip view...not too impressive but I was fine with it (the whole idea is to be on the strip, not watching it from your window).

I don't care about the money, I do care about business ethics. What's wrong with this charge Mr. Beaudreau ? Why do you think so many reviewers on this site have criticized this mandatory fee? Simple, it's easy to miss the information about this fee. It's missed in the fine print, or the hotel booking staff forgets to inform the guest or one member of the booking party forgets to tell the other members. Once missed the person feels deceived especially since it is a mandatory charge.

The resort fee includes valet AND Health Club (though the in-room guest book mentions something about a $22.00 user fee for the Health Club...this is obsolete or not applicable) for both of us, so we dismissed comments to this effect. Overall we loved the Trump LAS. Reception/check (though for us bewildering at first as it is not clearly marked) was superb. Our porter showed us attributes of our suite we would not have known otherwise, so it is well worth having baggage delivered to the suite. Staff throughout our stay were gracious, attentive and friendly. We appreciated security asking us for a room key one late evening, as we arrived with a bag of goodies in tow (looking like we were going for at a registered guest's suite). A billing issue at the end of the staff was corrected without question. The room was \"masculine\" by design; it means business and delivers Trump as we know it. The bathroom was gorgeous and the toiletries were lovely. On other notes, even though we were on the 52nd flr, I guess we are light sleepers and woke periodically to train blasts (which apparently is not reserved just for city view) and aircraft / helicopters (as we were on or close to a flight path), as well as the ambient city noise. I was not a big fan of the Spa...hmmm. I wandered in and found the attendants were more interested in chatting about days off than showcasing a possible treatment that would give this business hotel a \"romantic\" feel. Though the staff are great in the Health Club, I asked about spraying down equipment (especially mats) after I ran and stretched out. They seem to not know or expect Health Club users to do this....I immediately went to the room and showered with a feeling of \"icky\". It would be great if that floor was a tight as upstairs service-wise. I didn't expect a one night stay to be immediately charged to the card after booking. As I frequent more upscale hotels, I was unaccustomed of this practice by a hotel branded as luxury, but will respect this practice for the future (being a residence/condo establishment will treat it like a boutique hotel stay).

The sheets were high TC and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before. My complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet.

Beautifully laid out, clean, comfortable, great TVs (3 of them), and super bathroom. Yes, the furniture in the bathroom was knicked/scratched and one of the lights had a blown bulb, but oh well. Not so minor in my opinion was that the spa was waaaay overpriced (when compared with other, better-equipped properties). Hidden costs there (support staff fee) irked me, too. Back to expectations. This is a tough ecomony and Vegas has been one of the hardest hit. When you couple that with as low rates as we got, it was hard for me to expect 5-star quality treatment (at 2-star prices). We got 4-star service, which isn't bad. Oh, and for those who complained about the noise, what do you suppose the hotel staff can do about a train passing by?

The Trump Tower was unable to provide this upon request, leaving me with no reliable way to wake up when I wanted to.

The sidewalks are not well lighted, and in some places turn to gravel or are blocked by trees. 3) Advertising a low price, and then adding a mandatory $15 per night \"resort fee\" (actually, $16.80 with tax) is just plain tacky.

Upon arrival, we were immediately impressed. The property was beautiful and the gentlemen doing valet were very helpful. The thing I appreciated the most was that they did not expect tips, but rather appreciated them. When we first arrived, we had no cash on us and the gentlemen did not seem bothered at all! Once we had cash, we returned and tipped them extra simply because they treated us like gold without a tip right away. Check-in was very smooth as we arrived late and it was not busy. We were given a room on the 24th floor. The one thing that would have been nice, would have been a brief overview of the hotel & it's amenities. (ie. direction of the elevators, restaurants, etc) Basically they just wanted to make sure we signed for the ridiculous $15 \"resort fee\" and that's all they cared about. I really don't mind paying a resort fee when high-speed internet is included, however at Trump it is not. That would have to be my biggest complaint about our stay, if they can provide large jacuzzi tubs in every single room then internet should be complimentary. We were extremely impressed with the room and everything included. The room was modern, spacious, clean and upscale. Definately not just a place to lay your head. Large jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, huge vanity with TV in the mirror, separate glass enclosed shower and toilet. The only thing that I was a bit confused by was the way the entrance to the rooms is set up. From the hall-way there is a set of double doors which gives access to 2 rooms. From there you enter a small entry way where you can enter the individual rooms. Great, except that these doors are VERY big and heavy so I can only assume if there was someone staying in the room adjacent to ours that we would have disturbed them coming and going. The \"do not disturb\" notice is electronic and done from inside your room, which is nice. It displays a light outside the room for housekeeping to see. Kind of a neat touch.

On the mechanical side, we tried to use the stove the first morning. After three calls and an hour someone was there to reset the circuit breakers and get the stove started. 30 seconds after he left it quit working. We called and waited for him to come back a half hour later. He admitted that it was operating wrong and he had never seen this before. He was able to reset the breakers and get it running again. To his credit we waited a few minutes to make sure it was running correctly. About a minute after he left it broke again. After the third call, the front desk offered us to switch rooms. After we switched rooms, I noticed that they moved someone else in to the old room within a few hours of moving us out. Given how long it took to reach the mechanical person. I am skeptical that they fixed or replaced the stove. If you expect to use whirl pool tub or stove, I would suggest checking it works as you enter the room and definitely before you buy groceries. In the second room we were given, one of the showers would not get hot enough to be comfortable. Luckily there are two and we left it as close enough as we only needed one to work. I am not fond of resort fees but, they were very upfront about the $15 addition when we reserved. However, it is taxed so closer to $17. We were able to get some value out of it with the pool. However, I would rather have lost it gambling somewhere. The valet parking which was included in the resort fee was mixed. It was great early in the week when no one was there. We would get our car very quickly. However, there were several misses. When leaving the hotel at a busy time around 7pm, we had a 20 minute wait for the car. To make things worse, this is a non-smoking hotel and all the smokers would collect and smoke where you wait for your car. Not being a smoker, I really enjoy the non-smoking aspect, but did not like the full smoke out waiting for the car. The professionalism of the valet is debatable. Once while waiting for the car, we saw the valet squeal the tires of another car they were taking to park. We did not have anything stolen, but it was obvious someone had gone through our glove box. At one point we were stuck behind another car waiting for management to investigate their car they claimed was damaged by the hotel. There were points, I thought the valet was nice and other times I just wished I could walk to my own car. The wireless internet is not included in the resort fee. This is the one thing I actually would have voluntarily used the resort fee was an additional $12 per 24 hours. I did not know they allowed dogs in the hotel. Surprised to see quite a few small dogs. This may make some happy or unhappy. For some reason, I had the impression this hotel was on the strip (Las Vegas Blvd.). This is not the case. The sidewalk between the hotel and the strip is limited and it is almost a 1/4 mile. For normal people in good shape this is not an issue. For someone with a one year old a stroller it is a problem. In some spots the sidewalk is gravel and there are several curbs without ramps. The shortcut is to cross the street and walk through the mall. However, this only works when the mall is open. In general, the location is not that bad if you able to walk or take cabs. If you are willing to accept three/four star quality and the room rate matches those hotels, then I would recommend this hotel. If five star is expected than I would not recommend.", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi", "Title": "\u201cgood hote but no casino\u201d", "Author": "skhemka", "ReviewID": "UR50665131", "Content": "the hotel is good but no gaming facilities. also the connectivity is not that good to the strip, so one has to take a cab or shuttle to the strip hotels. it is JUST off the strip but qualifies as a strip hotel", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cTRUMP is a RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The bathroom glass door is very heave and it has about a 1/2 inch space between the end of the door and the floor. When I was opening the door I hit my toe very close to the nail, and let me tell you, it hurts, a lot!!! A simple piece of rubber or plastic over the button of the door would have done the trick.

Not a big deal, but when you stay over couple of days you get not so nice surprise at the checkout, so heads up would help. 5. Food: We wanted to order in-room service of sandwich or soup ( I was sick the whole stay, so could not get out of the room). When we calculated , the price for the chicken noodle soup would have been $9 + $5(service charge) + 18%(tax, gratitude).... My husband got downstairs to take it from the restaurant to avoid ridiculous fees, and the menu in the restaurant was completely different from the in-room menu. On the other hand.

The rooms were booked in advance and prepaid. One of the rooms was booked for an employee who no longer works for the company so one day before check-in I called Hotwire to amend the booking. Hotwire indicated that they could not change the booking name but recommended to get in touch with the hotel directly to let them know someone else was going to use that prepaid room. I called the reservations desk and they told me clearly that they could not change the reservation name but could add the new occupant as an extra named guest on the reservation so that he could use the room and check-in. I therefore added that employee's name to the reservation. When that employee arrived, there was no record of the amendment and they refused to give the room to him. I have now tried all day to try to fix this problem but have been bounced around all the departments at Trump without result. I called reservations first who listened to the situation and could not even find the reservation in the system. I had to get the Hotwire confirmation number and was then sent back to reservations who found it but told me they couldn't do anything. They transferred me to accounting, the wrong department as I didn't want a refund but for the empoyee to get his room (he's staying with another employee in the meantime) We just wanted the room for which we paid in advance in full, all resrvations were on the same credit card.

We were on the 47th floor and had a great view down the strip. The room has a kichenette, but not like a kitchenette that you may be thinking. This has a subzero refridge and is sleekly built in against the wall. It was so nice having this amenity.

Indeed, this Trump Tower Las Vegas has the look and feel of his guilded, brassed-up monoliths from two decades ago. However, the idea of getting a hotel suite like this for under $70 would be unimaginable. But The Trump Tower is one of those hybrid condo-hotels (where you never know who actually owns the unit you are staying in), and it does indeed offer a five-star caliber room with a mid-week pre-holiday rate at such a low price. That said, the service is ordinary at best. Simple requests for room items turned attempts to call housekeeping into the seemingly eternal abyss of the hotel phone system. Once the housekeeping is finally reached, the results are fine. The staff ably turned the sofabed (one in each suite) into a comfortable bed. Apparently, this hotel is the product of a Trump project gone the wrong way. Without a casino, this hotel has to fend for itself as a luxury hotel in a Las Vegas that is loosing its luxury customers fast. The result is to cut the rates as much as possible while cutting the service as minimally (or as invisibly) as possible. The toiletry items in the unit's spa-like bathrooms consisted of soap and skin cream. Hotel guests who know their way around five-star varieties also know that a bathroom with a separate oversized jacuzzi and a wide-screen color TV recessed behind the wall-sized mirror would also have a bit more on the vanity. Sure enough, an eventual call to housekeeping uncovered such goodies as sugar face scrub, exotic varieties of lotion, shower and bath gel and spa-quality bath salts. A $5 tip to the maid might ensure these items would be restocked the following day without another request. The hotel has a lunch restaurant on the wonderfully designed pool level, where well placed palm trees make the area seem like a summer oasis right off the Nevada mountains. The soups and salads are pricey at about $15 apiece, but they are well done and filling. The lobby-level restaurant simply prices itself out of use for most of the mid-week residents in early November. But those who can manage the nearly $30 breakfast buffet would be well rewarded with exquisite selections and friendly service in a setting that might very well be out of the most posh of design magazines. Room service was of high standard, too. But the best deal is to walk to Wallgreens and get breakfast items to use in the kitchenette. The $15 resort fee is a bit underhanded for a hotel that's not on a beach. But the extra fare came with fair warning during all stages of booking this hotel. I only wished the person checking me in didn't have to recite, with a straight face, that the $15 fee included two whole bottles of drinking water in addition to valet parking.

At check-in, the clerk suggested an upgrade to our room. They have a photo book showing the different rooms. We were at a conference which had gotten great rates ($90 a night + the usual Valet/Spa/Pool fee of $15.00 a day). The upgrade started at $50.00 a night additional and then, went down to $30.00 when I mulled it over. I offered $25.00 and got the two room suite. I did request to personally see the difference in the rooms. The clerk showed me both rooms. The studio room has one major flaw. The bathroom door is not your usual, solid wood or metal door. It is a partially frosted, see-through glass door. If a guest came to visit & someone was in the sitting in the bathroom... too much is visible. That made simple the decision to upgrade to the one bedroom suite. Even in the one bedroom suite (2 rooms), in the main bathroom area (off the bedroom), the door to the toilet is the same semi-frosted glass. Unless there is a bath mat rolled up on the floor, when the door is opened, the glass clangs against the 2 person Jacuzzi that is between it and the 2 person shower. It also has a bathroom with a separate shower off the kitchen/dining area. Fortunately, there is a solid wooden door there. For privacy, there is a sliding wooden door that separates the bath area from the bedroom. It is a large bathroom about 10 feet wide and 20 ft long. In the main bathroom there is a large table with lamp, a large wall mirror, a lighted magnifying mirror and a comfortable chair. That room could double as a study room! On the opposite wall slightly above the two sinks, is a 12\" plasma tv built into/behind the mirror. A handy remote control is provided. Watch out when you adjust the shower water temperature. There is no blue color for cold or red color indicator for hot water. Once it is set, it takes at least 30 seconds for a change in temperature as the water has to come from a few floors below. (For the 30th floor, it was at the 16th floor, I was told by an engineer). Fortunately, there is enough space between the shower head and the wall that you can duck out of a hot stream of water. That's little consolation when your face is covered with soap! Also, there is no automatic cut-off switch on the shower head when the temperature goes over 108\u2109/42\u2103 as recommended by plumbers. If you have a car, I suggest going to WalMart and purchasing some higher wattage light bulbs as the Trump chain provides a tiny 14 watt fluorescent bulb in each lamp = 55 watts incandescent. No need to strain eyes. We bought two packages of four Reveal incandescent 100 watt bulbs ($4.63 w/tax) for reading/study and used all but one. We also turned the lights off when we left the room; although electricity and lighting gets a run for the money in Vegas. We replaced the fluorescent bulbs at the end of the stay and left the Reveal full spectrum bulbs for the maid along with our tip. As you enter the suite at the kitchen there are two light switches on the wall. One doesn't seem to do anything. However, it controls an outlet with nothing plugged into it. Just above that outlet is a switch that controls the lamp on a table near the dining table and chairs. OTHER NOTES: The bed is very soft, if you are used to a firmer bed. I complained and the maid came to remove a 4 in/10.16 cm thick down padding over the mattress. That made it firmer. And, if you have an allergy to down/feather pillows, request the synthetic fill pillows. If you're a large person, be sure to request the extra long towels--everyday--or, the maid won't leave them always. And, if you want your room cleaned by a certain time request that at the concierge desk near the front desk. We clicked the on the wall lighted button for \"Do Not Disturb\" that appears outside the entrance way door (to two separate suites). With that showing, she never checked back to see if there was a change in the status. We either had to find her (not hard) or call the operator to get service. The suite came with a full refrigerator/freezer, glass-top stove & oven, microwave and an electric dishwasher. There are glasses, plates, silverwear, pots and pans too. If you're staying awhile and will do some eating in, you'll need to buy some dish cleaning liquid, detergent tabs or sponge at WalMart. The closest is at 4505 West Charleston Blvd, (702) 258-4540. There are .99\u00a2 Stores around too. The maid will supply dish towels. We washed the utensils were were about to use. The internet costs $14.95 per 24 hours. Possibly due to the gold on the windows, we found it hard to make speedy wireless connections, although there was a cell phone tower not over 1/4 of a mile away on the north side of the building. Cell phone calls would often drop off. Between two carriers we did get through. Local calls on the hotel's landline are free. I note that one comment mentioned the loud train whistle at night. That is true as the fresh air ventilation system is built into the horizontal frame of the windows. Otherwise, it is quiet. In the living room is a 47\"/119 cm LCD High Definition TV. The remote controls will just about drive you nuts (except for the bathroom one, which is simple). Everyone we spoke to said it took at least 15 minutes to figure it out. There are no printed instructions on how to use it. The bedroom has a 32\"/81 cm HD tv between two large closets that come with two fancy robes. If a person is short, it is better to close the right hand door of each closet before closing the left hand door as the latch is so high up, only a tall person can reach it. Other way around is to tape a piece of paper over the latch so it won't click shut. That wasn't the smartest place to put a latch. All parking and retrieval of cars is by valet. Typical tip is $2--$3.00 most said. All in all, we did well on that $130.00 a night stay.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms.

It was also very convenient to have another shower in the bathroom located in the living area. Having the bedroom and a seperate living area with a kitchen was amazing! The location of the hotel was not far from the spots that I was planning on going - XS at the Encore (right across the street, walking distance) and Lavo at the Palazzo ($6 cab ride). And there is the Fashion Mall right across the ways which was very convenient to run and grab make up I had forgotten to pack. Of course there is no casino here at the hotel so it is a lot more quiet. I'd say it is a great place to stay with your family since the rooms are big and there is not any gambling and drinking going on at this hotel. The WORST part about staying at the Trump was the service. I tried to call in 3 times the morning of check out and was placed on hold each time and anytime anyone did answer, they would just put me on hold again - like they didn't know who to transfer me to. I ended up having to go downstairs to check out. Also, I tried to call Valet before I came downstairs to have my car brought up so it was ready right when I got out, but no one picked up at Valet either. If you are big on room service and needing attention from staff, do NOT stay here. Our group got by since we were really only staying there to sleep in the room and playing outside the hotel, but if you are looking for a place to stay where you want to stay within the hotel the entire time for their entertainment and amenities, this is NOT the place, go somewhere else! Overall, I'd say it's a good bang for the buck if you are on a budget and want a comfortable and clean room.

Jacuzzi tub was wonderful. Also, when I discovered our radio was broken, a new one was promptly brought up by a very professional attendant from house-keeping. The only reason why it's not 5 stars from me: it's a little too far from the strip (must take taxi), and I wasn't really floored by the food we got at the DJT.

If you are expecting a real five-star hotel, this is not for you. If you usually stay at a Marriott or Ramada, this will most likely feel like a five-star hotel. At a real five-star hotel, the doormen would never let you open your own door - here the doormen are sometimes manning the door. I can live with this, but some folks may have issues with this. Now the bathroom is top notch - nice shower, huge tub, and privacy door for the toilet, but there can be hot water issues. From talking with them, it seems they have boiler problems (again, a five-star hotel would not stand for this). The problem was fixed after a few minutes of letting the water run, but this too could upset you if you were not flexible. When we first arrived, we had a lower room (18th floor), but after reading these reviews, we asked for a higher room because of what we read about the train noise. Victor, the front desk manager, we very accomidating and relocated us to the 53rd floor on the city view side. From here, we barely heard the train - and the view was incredible. We got in late on the first night and tried the hotel restaurant and it had a $29 per person prix-fix menu that we tried. The food is actually really good. One night we wanted to eat at Paris' Mon Ami Gabi so we visited the concierge. Vicki was very helpful with the reservation and pulled some strings to get us a time that we wanted. Some of the other concierges come across snooty, but Vicki is top notch. We used the gym a couple times. It has everything you need to get a well rounded workout. No free weights, but they do have machines and dumbells. Treadmills, elliptical machines, and bikes have TV's built into them. They have trainers there to help you with the equipment if you have any questions. We also visited the pool. I thought it was nice. They had music playing and a DJ that tried to make it a fun atmosphere. My wife seemed to think that the waitresses were a bit snobby. We ordered a few drinks (sangria), which were refreshing. We would have ordered more, if our waitress paid attention to us. I also would have brought my own beer, but they do not allow outside drinks. Location to the strip is not too far, but can wear on you after awhile. It is about 5 minute walk to the strip, but another 10 to where the action really starts. Closest casino is Wynn or Treasure Island - for betting NCAA or NFL games on Saturday or Sunday morning by 9 or 10AM, this is a bit of a drag after a long Friday or Saturday night. We often used the mall across the street as a means to get to the Strip. The mall (they call it Fashion Show) is your typical mall with the usual suspects, some high-end. A real five-star hotel would not stand for this less than stellar location - they would have had a shuttle constantly taking you to the Strip. The only real nagging matter for me was the daily fee for internet usage. A real five-star hotel would not charge you for internet access. I already knew about the daily \"resort fee,\" so I did not have an issue with that. My guess is that they charge this separately because of a commission structure with the booking agencies and they cannot afford to discount this expense. If I go back to Vegas, would I stay here again? Probably not. I think I would rather be on the Strip. Am I disappointed with my choice? Not at all. We had fun and enjoyed the hotel, but I would rather be in the middle of the action.

I wanted to try a 5 star hotel just to see if it was worth it at this destination. I got a great deal at $75 a night through priceline. Now I read about the resort fee and it was way cheaper than others (Planet hollywood charges a hotel fee but if you want to use their pool they charge an additional $25.) Turning onto the hotels street you can see the fenced up property of where the \"casino\" may be built. the road behind is a bit scary I wouldn't suggest anyone walking at night. There is only valet parking which is annoying I don't like to give control of my car to anyone, plus that means I have to take everything out because I can't access my car when I want to. Service: The valet attendants are rather nice, but again they are expecting a tip. The front desk was horrible. Their fake politeness irritated me. Having dressed properly it was interesting to see the change of attitude when they found out I booked through priceline. I found that rude. No help on giving me any directions or information about the hotel. They rushed me through to get to the next person inline, only one person. The pool attendant ignored me maybe because I appeared younger. I had fun at the pool with a nice couple I met there and neither party new where the towel drop off was. The concierge attendant was genuinely polite, she even printed me directions to a best buy near the hotel and asked if I needed anymore assistance. Common areas: The hotel appears small compared to others in the vicinity. Online I was intrigued by the \"gold\" hotel only to discover that the mandalay and the mirage are have gold reflecting windows as well. The lobby was nice, but I have seen hotels in Hawaii with nicer decor. The pool are was decent. i loved the music playing from speakers, which caters to a younger crowd, and the landscaping that blocked the strip. I felt like I was not in las vegas and I liked that. The pool was nicely heated but be warned the deepest area is only 4 ft. I needed to do some aqua therapy which could not be done. They offer in water benches on both sides of the pool. Room: I was in studio facing the city not the strip. First, the room size was amazing! My room was actually quite I was up late and didn't hear any trains and I was on the 18th floor. I loved the mountain view in the morning and it gave me an idea of what traffic was like. I could see circus circus, and the stratosphere. I appreciated the dual entry way that kept the hallway noise at bay. Now the closets were european style so to me they were average. It is very contemporary. I personally love the color scheme, same as my homes. They provide coffee table books and a tic tac toe wooden game. Easy check out from the room via the TV. The two water bottle equal one average water bottle. The flat screen TV appeared cheap. My bed seemed rushed. I could see the sheets popping out below the bed frame. Oh not to mention there was a giant blood stain on one of my pillow cases!!!!! one of the lamps didn't work properly it wouldn't turn on until I wiggled the cord. Now I agree with the others, the bed was comfortable! I have a bad back and was very grateful that I woke up with out any aches. The stereo works with any ipod so bring it along =) there is a stove, microwave both are convection. The sub zero fridge is a good size. Note Target, albertsons, best buy, and other stores are not too far away at all, just near flamingo and maryland street. Bathroom: Now that bathroom was nice. The tub was huge! being only 5'2\" I almost drowned because I put too much water in it and kept slipping. There are three jet modes. I am not a tub person. The shower had good pressure, but no seating bench. This is hard when you are trying to shave your legs. There was noticeable lime residue on the shower head. The complimentary shampoo, conditioner, facial soap, and lotion were excellent. Toilet paper was hard and cheap. They provide a vanity mirror with 10X view and lighting which I really appreciated. The hair dryer that was provided had great power didn't take long to dry my hair. The cord for the tv in the mirror is visible so it ruins the illusion of a magical tv. Down fall to that is the shower glass. If it was only clear I could have watched tv while letting the hot water relax my muscles from my travels. My total came out to roughly $100 for the night and besides the rudeness and the stain, I'd say it would be worth it especially since it is a smoke free hotel. Now pay anymore than that better be sure you have a kid in diapers to make up for the costs (great kid amenities, baby warmers, free diapers, etc). PS. self-parking is free at almost every casino so invest in renting a car and save money. My parents always travel to vegas and driving saved our feet they said I saved them over $200 in tip and taxi fees. check out that newspaper for events and deals on the strip.

Your perception of the Trump will largely depend on whether you want a casino in your hotel, and how quickly you want to be able to reach the Strip. We liked it that the hotel was non-smoking. We booked the Trump through Priceline. I think we paid about $142/night, including taxes. When we arrived, we learned that there is a mandatory $15/night \"resort\" fee that they tag on. Priceline would not let me cancel based on this; the release I initialed apparently mentioned the possibility of resort fees. Live and learn! In any event, once you added on the resort fee, the price was not outstanding. The front desk 'upgraded' us to a room with a view of the Strip. Our room was on the 51st floor. We had the impression that the hotel was largely unoccupied during our stay, and felt that the hotel must be losing money and trying to conserve a bit. As noted by another recent poster, the concierge was lacking. We called down to inquire about free roulette and craps lessons (they are at the Venetian at 11 for craps, followed by 12 for roulette). The concierge said she would call us back; she never did. The room itself is lovely. I was happy with the bed; my sleeping partner felt it was too soft. There was no option of queen beds in the rooms - each room has a king bed with a pull out sofa. The nicely-decorated rooms have a ton of storage space, two large closets (with two nice fluffy robes) in-drawer safe, ironing board w iron, lint brush, extra blanket, coffee maker (with only caf coffee - the nearest coffee shop is about a 10 minute walk), blender, microwave, fridge, range, kitchen sink, wine opener, utensils, dishes, etc. It would be a great place to make lunches/breakfasts, if only we could have found a grocery store in Las Vegas. :) Ice is available on every floor. The bathroom is very nice. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, 2 bars soap, shower cap provided. No shower gel, no sewing kit. When I needed a sewing kit, housekeeping took about 45 minutes to bring it to the room. The shower is lovely and large. The toilet is in its own room. 2 sinks on the vanity, and lots of storage. Ample towels. I did peek into the business center. They charge for internet service - by 15 minute increments. And there is a charge to print documents, except your boarding pass. The pool area is lovely. We enjoyed the large double-lounge sofa chairs. The pool closed at 6p, however. We wondered whether this was part of a \"conservation\" effort to reduce costs. Other reviewers have noted an issue with the location of the hotel - about 5 minutes off the Strip. 5 minutes is a long walk on high heels. :) Yes, you can cross the street and cut through Nordstrom into the Fashion Mall and then figure your way out and over to Treasure Island, but it is certainly not a convenient location. If you want quiet, then you might enjoy the hotel. For us, it was not convenient. Also, when one of us wanted to rest or sleep, the other had to go back to the room - there was no option of remaining downstairs to game. Walking alone in the middle of the night past the empty lot does not feel secure. Moreover, there are not sidewalks on the entire walk to the Strip - at times you must walk in the road. We did not use room service, the restaurants, or the bar, so I can't comment. You might enjoy this hotel if you are looking for a lovely non-smoking hotel without a casino, with okay service, that is a short heavily-trafficked walk off the strip.

First the pros: Clean Nice rooms Food is decent Beautiful bathrooms Cons: Location Resort Fee Train NOISE starting at 3:30am I had read some of the reviews regarding the train noise so when I made the reservation I informed the agent of my concern and he assured me he would reserve a quiet room for us. If what we got was a quiet room I am afraid to know what a regular room is like. At 3:30am, 4:30, 5:30, 6:30 (you get the point) Sunday, Monday and Tuesday mornings the very LOUD train noise sounded like it was next door. We were on the 36 floor facing the Wynn hotel which is what they qualify as their quiet room. I went to the front desk and complained only to have the very nice lady explain to me that she couldn't do anything else because I was already in a quiet room. She went on to mention that this is a known problem and they are working with the city to see if they could get the train to stop blowing the horn when it passes literally on the side of their hotel. Now I knew why they were so accommodating and lowered the price to $89 when I made the reservation. While we were given a rate of $139 on Saturday and $89 on the other days once you add up all the dumb fees they tack on you are better off staying on the strip for $129 - $140 per night. They tag on a $15 resort fee to use their pool, spa and two 4oz waters they provide nightly. Now they tax you on the resort fee and the room rate (two different line items on your bill) just not worth it. One last thing to consider. The hotel is off the strip not a huge deal because the walk is not too far. However, at night the street that you must walk through to get to the hotel is very, very dark and the sidewalk is not paved so if you are not wearing sneakers you are in trouble. Most importantly, it is not a safe street. You have cabs, cars, and shuttles flying by especially at night and since no lighting exists you can easily get hit by a car. One night when we were walking back to the hotel we saw a couple nearly get hit by a shuttle. It was very scary because no one even saw the shuttle coming.

The suites are large with beautiful bathrooms ,exceptioally comfortable beds and nice understated decor plus a kitchen and lots of storage/wardrobe space,and floor to ceiling windows giving great views of las vegas.We found the staff very helpful and efficient unlike some other posters on this site.Check in for us was also very quick at 8.00pm on a Sunday.The pool area is not large but still very nice with great beds, loungers .parasols etc. the pool itself is 4ft deep and not very large but adequate . The two restaurants and room service in the Hotel are really good if a little expensive as is the cost of drinks in the hotel. Be aware Trump charge a daily resort fee of $15+tax which is mandatory even if you do not use the facilities it covers(use of pool and fitness suite,valet car parking,2 bottles of water/day and a daily newspaper). There is a railway line nearby and Trains can be heard hooting at times , and could wake you up during the night/early morning. However we did not find this a particular problem Overall we thought this was a great value Hotel and worth its 5* rating.we paid $95/day average for a city View suite plus resort fee,and thought it well worth the money.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, shame about the valet and internet reception\u201d", "Author": "jsarchibald", "ReviewID": "UR47290066", "Content": "I really enjoyed staying in this hotel, at least for half of it anyway.

It was like being at home with all the conveniences. Daniel was very accommodating and understood the needs of a young family.

The hotel is only a few years old and it is lovely. I would highly recommend staying at the Trump. Shopping is only a few steps away with the Fashion Square Mall across the street. There is a free shuttle operating from the Trump to Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. Suites are well furnished and are also equipped with refrigerators and safes.

The charge isn't optional however, so it's just a bit of a racket. The internet would have been an additional charge (didn't use it). Even though we got a good room rate, there weren't any affordable dining options here so we ended up going elsewhere as opposed to having $50 breakfasts. It would have been much more convenient to have a hotel with these kinds of facilities. The hotel is right directly on train tracks. At least on the \"City View\" side, you can vividly hear the train. We were on the 42nd floor. The trains woke us up 2-3 times per night. We live right on a busy 6-lane street at home, and yet the train was loud enough to wake even us up. To move to the other side of the hotel was going to be $25 per night extra (facing the strip instead of the city). In retrospect, it would have been worth it because of the train noise.

The concierge was super helpful, and got us great tickets to Penn & Teller.

Went with 5-star for $85 and got the Trump. The hotel is really in a good location beside Fashion Show Mall. It is not actually on the strip but set back about a quarter mile. You can tell they had big plans to expand towards the strip but I guess the economy stopped that. It is hard to miss the white and gold tower from any where, so not hard to find. The lobby is very modern and elegant. Lots of gold that drives next the tacky edge but never goes over. I was there on a Wednesday night, so no crowded. Went right up to a desk clerk and was checked in quickly. Room on 50th floor facing north (downtown). They would have upgraded to a \"strip\" view if I would have paid another $25. No need. The room was great. These must have originally been marketed as condo rooms because the were large. This was a king room and the layout was one large room with bed, seating area and bathroom. The difference was that the room also had a large mini-fridge, sink and built-in cooking surface. Plates and silverware where provided. Very well appointed. The room was modern wood and metal. Very elegant. The bed was low to the ground and had lots of pillows and great linens. It had an ultrasoft mattress that was comfotable. The sitting area was large with a full couch and two comfortable sitting chairs around a full size cocktail table. The whole outside wall was floor-to-ceiling window that had a great view of the mountains. There was an ample desk with comfortable chair. The TV was a flat screen but it was small compared to what you would expect with the rest of the room. The bathroom was a real highlight. Large with seperate doored water closet, oversized jetted tub and huge walk-in shower. There were two large sinks in the vanity that was also huge. Everything was spotless. If you judge a good hotel room by its bathroom, this is one of the best I have seen. The toilet area and shower have textured smoked glass that is incredible. My only complaint is that the shower was so large, it could have easily taken another shower head either in the other wall or overhead along with a shower seat. It seemed a waste to have all that space without some extras. The location was great to get anywhere on the strip. I had not been to the Fashion Show Mall in years, but a quick walk across the street and there you were. Really nice and had a great dinner at the sushi restaurant at the front of the mall. Was there during happy hour (3-7pm) and everything was half-off. It was great. Note that the hotel does not have a casino. That is so unusual for any hotel in Vegas - especially one this nice. No long walks through the casino, loud noises, etc. If you like to gamble, you have to go across the street to the Wynn or on the other side of the mall to Treasure Island. I would stay here again.

Amazing modern decor, stainless-steel kitchen (love the SubZero, nice touch), beautiful bedroom (nice view of the Deja Vu Showgirls & Erotic Museum--lol), and the bathroom was the piece de resistance. The master bathroom has a shower for 2 and a hot-tub, not to mention a t.v. in the mirror of the his & his sink area -- SWEET! Now, the not so good points of Trump International. They have the audacity to charge each room a $16 a day fee for two 4 oz. waters in your room, use of the pool and gym. Seriously? Totally ridiculous. The pool area is very small, especially for Vegas--boring, small lap pool (4' was the deepest point). The girl at check-in looked like she might work across the street at the \"gentlemen's club\" (a ton of pancake make-up and turquoise contact lenses, not very professional) and had a snobby demeanor. While our room was lovely, as we walked in I noticed a few stains on the carpet near the entry-way and the velvet-like couch had lint on it. The bed was too soft and felt unstable. The frame was squeaky, every time we moved it made loud squeaky noises and felt a tad wobbly. Our friend's had the same complaint with their bed--I've had better beds at the Best Western, seriously.

The studio suite is much bigger than we had imagined, immaculate and with all the advertised amenities. Bathroom is really large with a jetted tub, separate shower and toilet areas and an extra large vanity (The TV embedded in the mirror is something new!). King size bed/extra soft pillows has to be among the best we ever slept on. Lot of closet space, extra large LCD TV, kitchenette with cooktop and some essentials. We were upgraded to a strip view on the higher floors for a small acceptable fee. And boy! they got some really fast elevators here. Being a non-smoking hotel with no casinos, it is a quiet retreat from the smoky and loud casino hotels on the strip. Good place to crash down after all that hard work making money at the casinos. There is a 15$ resort fee (per day), but we were aware of this fact and is charged by almost all hotels there. We also tried out the breakfast in room and food/service was pretty good, and pricing fairly reasonable. The stay gave us a feeling of royalty!Definitely staying here again on a return trip! The fashion show mall (pretty big one) is just across the road from Trump's exit. Can be used as a shortcut to Treasure Island casino and beyond for those preferring to walk. Having a rental car is better though, as casinos further down south of the strip like MGM and Mandalay are pretty far away. Car parking is free at all casinos, and that really helps roam around quickly. We had a day trip to Hoover dam and GrandCanyon planned, so a car was absolutely essential. Also we generally saw long queues for the bus. Tix4Tonight (for discount show tickets) is in front of the Mall on the Las Vegas Blvd side, we got discount tickets for Blue Man Group (50$) and Mac King Comedy/Magic (20$). Both highly recommended and a tad cheaper than other Cirque O Soliel shows. The lines begin forming at 9:30 and they open at 10AM. They have a coupon online which helps you get rid of the service charge. Stratosphere tower is further north of the Trump, hosting those extreme rides. We took the XScream, that shoots you down and dangles you from the edge of the 108th floor. One scary ride, just lasts about 2 minutes, but definitely worth taking. Sit in the front 2 seats if possible, as you will extend well beyond the rails before abruptly stopping giving you one hell of an experience of nothingness below! There are a few souvenier shops between Trump and Stratosphere, mostly near the Sahara. The easiest/fastest way back to the airport/car rental place. Take the Las Vegas Blvd, turn left on Sands ave (between Wynn and Venetian) drive upto Paradise Ave and then turn right. Its a straight road all the way from there on! Also a note for those who are from out of state and driving to Grand Canyon, Arizona has a photo enforcement policy, so drive 11 miles above the speed limit and there is a chance you may get snapped along the way.

The first night we asked for the bed to be made because they didn't provide the linens to make it up. We gave them 1 1/2 hours and they still needed another prompt to show up late. A sheet was placed on the mattress, yes no pad and no protection between you and the mattress. Yikes that was the worst quality day bed, mostly like a hammock except directly on the springs.

We arrived with several bags, the valet did not assist us in unloading the car - there was no bell hop present and no door man so we basically had to handle all of our luggage without anyone even raising an eye to offer to call for assistance. During the check in process, the hotel clerk loudly announced that since we booked our reservation through priceline.com we would be receiving the lowest quality suite grade in their hotel. He was clearly grandstanding as we caught startled glances from the couple checking in besides us. This was completely unnecessary. The suites are great and contain every amenity possible, but it was hard for us to ignore the poor service we received. Even after our check in experience we tried to keep an open mind, but the staff had an air of arrogance with the exception of the valet staff (minus our initial check in). There was never a door man present (occasionally the valets would open the door if they were available). We have stayed at all the other 5 star hotels in Las Vegas and we received far superior treatment in each of them.

Our college student slept (so she says) on the L-shaped couch that converted into a very large sofabed.

I have not left yet so I am writting this review while my memories are fresh. The Trump far exceeded my expectations. We managed to get a room for $108 per night on priceline. I do think we could have done better but I really wanted this hotel and didn't want to spend days bidding to save a few bucks. The Trump certainly won't dissapoint at $108 a night. I have paid triple for bad rooms in Vegas. The rooms are ultra modern, clean and large. The beds are so amazing like being on clouds. You really won't want to get out of bed. We've used room service and eaten at the retaurant here. The food is outstanding but do keep in mind it is pricey.... But Vegas is that kind of town. Before I booked I read other reviews of the Trump on tripadvisor prior to booking this hotel. I did notice that people complained about nickle and diming. Although I'm not a fan of nickel and diming I think I you can keep in mind that you are getting a quality room with outstanding service for $108 bucks you do have to respect they have to make money somewhere. They do have a $15/day resort fee which is typical in hotels of this caliber. They do have free valet BUT parking fee is $14 per night. So expect around $30 misc fees per night. I thought the hotel is worth it. I would recommend a $25 studio suite upgrade of the strip. I'm in Room 5702 so 57th floor with direct view of the strip. Also the room is very quiet on the strip view side of the hotel. One thing I have to mention is that the bathrooms are incrdible at the Trump. Check out the pictures on mu review. The jet tubs are amazingly clean. There is also a flat panel tv built in to the mirror so you can watch tv while getting ready. Trump is also nice since there is no loud casino.

That said, we loved our 4 day stay at the Trump hotel in late August, early September. We were also one who received this hotel on Priceline for $90/night. Also, were concerned about some of the comments from previous guests, all of which turned out to be factual. Still, we decided to give it our best shot and see what happens. First, the valet. I agonized over this, hating the fact that there was no self parking. For short hops, I did use the Fashion Show Mall's parking lot, across the street, yes, to avoid the $2-$5 valet tips. I wasn't just about the money, but more about the time it took to park and retrieve the car. When we knew we were in for the night, then we would valet park, which is included in the $15 resort fee. The resort fee of $15 per day included the parking, 2 bottles of water in the room each day, and use of the fitness facility (which nobody in our party used), was not unreasonable, although other Vegas hotels have free parking and free hotel pools and fitness facilities that are, by far, superior to the mini-size pool of the Trump hotel. The rooms and public facilties have to be the main selling point of this hotel. Beautiful, modern and fashionable in all respects. The bathroom with seperate shower and tub, two sinks, enclosed toilet area and, yes, TV in the mirror are, overall, very impressive. The room itself was large with a King bed, 2 seater couch and 2 easy chairs. The couch unfolds into a double bed, although with a matress far inferior to the one on the King size bed. The kitchenette has everything but a stove, and there is two of everything: mug, cups, cutlerly, plates, etc. Unlike another reviewer, there were pots and pans supplied in our room, including a blender and stove kettle. Our room, 4319, overlooked the \"city\". This meant we were not overlooking the strip, but had beautiful views of downtown Las Vegas, which looked beautiful at night, and the mountains, which looked beautiful all day. The elevators were, as another reviewer noted, the fastest I've ever and I seldom ever had to wait more than 30 seconds. The sidewalk issue. Despite what other reviewers promised there is NO complete sidewalk on EITHER side of the street all the way to Las Vegas Blvd. (\"the strip\") I have personally walked down both sides. The better sidewalk can be found opposite the hotel; however, when you get close to the end of the street the sidewalk veers into the Fashion Show Mall. To continue you must walk on the road, or across a rock planter, which is doable if careful. The sidewalk on the side of the Trump hotel is incomplete and, at times, passes broken bottles, strewn garbage and some sort of derilict gate house of sorts. Either way the walk would not be a pleasant one at night. My only suggestion is what other reviewers have stated: walk through the Fashion Show Mall, accessible from Nordstroms. Nordstroms is a less than 30 second walk across the street from the hotel, while the strip is 10 minutes through the mall. The only problem is when Nordstroms closes, there is no mall entry point from the Trump side of the mall, which makes access impossible. (we tried one early morning before the anchor stores: Nordstrom, etc. opened). Internet is $9.95 per day. Should be included in the resort fee. My son and his friends who were staying in 2320, complained that although they called room service to pick up their table, it was still in the hall 24 hours later, even though they were told it would be picked up within the hour. At times I wished this hotel had a casion, and at other times I was glad for the peace, quiet and lack of cigarette smoke (I forgot just how annoying this is in public places until I re-arrived at Vegas this year). The hotel is what it is: a residence that sub-lets owners rooms out as hotel suites. If one goes in with this in mind they won't be disappointed. If one is expecting a typical Vegas hotel/resort then there will be disappointment. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I would return for the peace and quiet again.

The shower is separate from the tub. The tub is great if you are wanting to have a little bath time with someone special! Also in the middle of the mirror, it turns into a tv! It has two sinks which is very useful! So watch the news while you brush your teeth or a movie while you take a bath! Also every standard room comes with a kitchen.

The hotel does not have a casino so you don't have an endless line of people trailing in and out of the property. I felt that it was a little bit my personal oasis away from the strip. The employees were the nicest I have ever experienced on the strip, from the room service attendant to the concierge and wait staff. The only person I wasn't impressed with was the gruff man at check-in, but he was still nice. This hotel had the fastest check-in I have ever experienced on the strip. And this was my 10th trip to Vegas. The rooms were awesome. I had a city view room, but the room was still amazing. The five piece bath was gorgeous. Large jet tub, 2 sinks, a hidden commode, large shower, as well as a TV imbedded into the mirror. My only beef here was that the beautiful floor would turn into an ice rink if you stepped on one drop of water so be very careful. They did have bath mats. The hair dryer sits in a bag on a shelf under the vanity. I even liked the makeup mirror. I felt that the flat screen TV could have been bigger, in the main room. The sitting area was so so comfortable. I was also expecting a more comfortable bed. Ours had a hump in it. It was a King though. The worst problem was that there was a train that would blow its whistle every few hours and a very tacky museum was beneath our window. You could also hear the highway. This hotel has limited eating facilities and is designed for your own cooking with a glass cooktop with two burners or a microwave. Room service is also available 24 hours. The restaurant is very good for breakfast but as expected expensive. You will not find the cheap buffet here. It is very easy to walk across the street to Fashion Show Mall for snacks and shopping and to reach the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, or walk toward the east to experience the Encore and Wynn. We took taxi rides quite a bit and it averaged about $12 with tip. I seriously enjoyed getting away from the rat race of the strip and would stay here again. I did not check out the pool area, and there is quite a large pool and nice fitness facility.

The building itself - from the lobby through the elevators and common areas to our studio room - was immaculate and spotless (pool is an okay size but who really goes to Vegas to hang at the pool all day, right?). The service was uber-friendly and courteous. Security in the lobby discretely ensures the place is for paying guests only. The DJT restaurant in the lobby is quite good but we enjoyed our meals on the Strip better ... breakfast was overly pricey and not worth a second visit. The only real nit - the mandatory valet service took about 10-15 minutes everytime. It is included in the resort fee, which we thought was reasonable, and the valet staff are great, but self-parking if available would have been our choice. We finally figured out, though, that for shorter non-overnight stops at the hotel to change clothes, take a nap, etc., the trick is to park in the underground parking at Nordstroms and just walk 90 seconds across to the hotel - saved us a bunch of time.

She said she would come right back and never did. SO GROSS!!! when our luggage was finally brought up, we realized my friend's camera was missing from her bag which was partially open. The bellman said they didnt have it, so we figured maybe it fell out in the car. The valet said they didnt have it, so my friends camera was stolen by someone, probably a hotel employee.

They added a $15-per-day fee to each room (resort fee) without telling me upfront. The hotel is located in an industrial area right next to train tracks...and TRAINS blow their ghastly horns all night every night--like HOURLY--sometimes four or five blasts at a time.

One potty seat was broken, and I had to tip a maid to bring TP--it's SUPPOSED to be there already! The bed was so hard that I ended up sleeping on the couch an hour at a time in between train blasts!!! The facility itself looks posh, but it ends there.

More lies from them. They sent me pictures of the rooms we'd have (two of them) and when we got there we were put in other rooms--nowhere close to the pictures they sent.

Front desk Peter hooked us up with an unexpected upgrade. Thanks Peter! It had a full kitchen, full bathroom off the kitchen, bedroom with a humongous master bathroom. Seriously the bathroom was the size of a 2nd bedroom. There was an LCD in the living room and another LCD in the bedroom. Our suite had a view of the area behind the strip so we had a great view of Deja Vu (gentlemen's club) and the Love Boutique. In the distance, we could see Fremont Street and the 15 freeway.

I am amazed at the people who pay admit to geting a room for $70 on priceline and then say the hotel isn't up to their standards of a 5 star hotel. The fact is, you can always get this hotel under $130...and often under $100. For that price in most cities you are staying at the Courtyard or Holiday Inn. Instead we got a wonderful studio suite, great bed, wonderful view with huge windows, nice ammenities, robes, huge huge jet tub, flat screen tv, tv in bathroom mirror, fridge, stove.... the room was in perfect condition. So to compain about the rooms at these rates in my opinion is really of base, and likely coming from people who expect to get star treatment after geting a room on priceline for $50. Now the thing you could complain about is the location. It isn't great, but it is not terrible either. It is a 30 second walk from the hotel to Nordstroms and the mall. It is about a 7 minute walk to the Wynn. The other thing that makes the location bad in my opinion is that you have to valet, so you can't come and go as easily as you may want...but again it wasn't a huge problem by any means.

The staff was very friendly, even opening the front doors as u approach. Our room was even ready upon our check in at 11am. The maid was normally prompt and efficient. On 1occasion I had to call for water etc. twice, when none was not left in the room or delivered on first request. The room and hallways, pool etc were very nice and kept quite clean. The bathroom in our room was too die for!!! Service is available at the pool and was not intrusive. It was however, quite pricey, as may be expected ( .5L of water $6, pitcher of spiked lemonade $55). The only real problems we had were the trains and road noise that came into the room thru the window vents. The vents don't seal well and when it is windy they actually whistled! I thought it was an alarm at first?! We were on the 39th floor at @ 4am, 4:30am, & 5am the trains would pass by and blow the whistles repeatedly. I woke up every nite. The hotel does charge $15 a day service fee. It was supposed to be for the valet, water in room, daily paper and use of the pool and fitness center. There really isn't any other option to park but valet, so we didn't fuss about the charge. The pool is not in the lobby as it is in just about all the other hotels in Las Vegas. Which is nice. You don't have to parade thru a casino and gawking passersby on your way to of from either the pool or adjacent fitness center which is very nicely equipped. TIP: If Las Vegas Blvd. is packed, turn off on Russell Road to the south as you are coming from the airport, then take Dean Martin and Industrial all the way to the hotel on the backside. No problems with traffic then. It is kind of a service road.

They have no record of the charges to my account, and claim they wouldn't have charged my account, only done an authority - when I offered to show them my bank statement they changed their mind and agreed with me, then said it will take 5 business days to refund my account - by which time I will be back at home. Therefore - they're taking all of my spending money ((WITHOUT my authority)) and won't give it back until long after I leave the country. After the initial difficulties checking in, I offered to get an alternative credit card authority sent through. This seemed like like a fair solution - until the hotel screwed it up in multiple ways. Firstly, they sent the form asking for authority for my first night only - which, incidentally, they have already charged me for TWICE so it seems they want a 3-for-1 deal???; then the person who received it didn't print it out, and took the next day off which means that now, 48hrs later, even though they've received the authority and have charged me multiple times, they're asking for more money, denying they've charged anything to my card and refusing to use the credit card authority they've already received. All in all, worst hotel experience ever. Staff are not helpful at all. Hotel charges multiple times for single nights and takes money off cards they don't have authority to use, and mysteriously charge accounts and yet have no record of it.

When we entered the room, there was a terrible stale odor (we will remember it as THEtrump odor - very specific) - probably nobody had been in the room for a while. The bellman confirmed the problem so I called the front desk to request another room. They moved us to another \"better\" room which had similar odor (much less, though) and we decided to take it (tired of the flight and wasted too much time). The bathroom was nice, but there were a few things broken there. The \"kitchen\" did not have anything in it - no utensils, only 2 glasses (I guess they wanted to show some class with this :-)??? - but then why advertise as kitchen?). The next day we went out - by the way, there is *nothing* to do in this hotel, very boring - and spent the day in the normal hotels on the strip. When we came back, we found our room not cleaned even though we left the housekeeping light on! There was a message on the voicemail from housekeeping saying that they did not clean the room because we left do not disturb sign on the door! What a [--]! Are they blind of someyhing? I called the housekeeping and explained the situation - they apologized and said that they were sending someone to clean the room right away. Then we were waiting and waiting and waiting... 50 min. (in the mean time, the kids were tired and wanted to go to bed already). Eventually, after nodoby came, I called housekeeping again. The same stupid [--] picked up the phone and started apologizing, saying that somebody was on the way (obviously lying). We waited to 20 more min. and I called back asking for the manager. I was put on hold for 15 min. and eventually talked to someone who presented herself as \"manager of housekeeping\". She said she was going to find out what's going on and in the mean time send someone to clean the room. Eventually housekeeping lady came (after 30 more min) and was cleaning the room for ~2 hour!!!

Here were some of the complaints on this site: Staff being snotty -- absolutely not! I found the staff incredibly friendly and courteous. I did not come across one snotty or unfriendly staff. Everybody, from the front desk to the gym to the pool were all friendly Loud noise -- never heard that either. The hotel was very quiet. I never heard a peep in my room. I never heard a train or loud music. I never heard loud guest. I never heard anything. Dirty rooms. -- The rooms were clean. I will say that I cut myself on something in the carpet. My foot was bleeding and I called the front desk. They were up immediately and sent a doctor to my room. I did not need medical attention but they went above and beyond to take a care of situation that shouldn'th have happened. this was the only negatve experience of the trip Hotel being off the strip. Ok, I have read everything from the hotel is on a dark road, that it takes 15 minutes to walk on the strip, that there is no sidewalk, that you have to take a cab to the strip. ALL NOT TRUE! There is a sidewalk that runs from the hotel to the strip. It is fairly lit and was a 5 minute walk! I timed it. It took no time at all, and was an easy walk. The long way is through the mall, which is right across the street. If you want to stay on the strip, then don't stay at Trump. If you don't mind the 5 minute walk, its not a bad place to stay. Hotel itself. there is no casino. But, the TI is a 10 minute walk and we ended up gambling over there. The hotel was clean and the pool is nice. its not huge. Its medium sized, There is loud music buts its a fun environment. They have very friendly servers who are serving drinks. I enjoyed the pool very much. the rooms were great.

Nevertheless we wanted a good bed to sleep in and got a great deal on Priceline. The hotel says it is 'on the strip' but is actually located 200m off the strip but this isn't a problem and it is only 2 min walk to the Strip and the Wynn. The entrance, through Nordstrom in the Fashion Show Mall is straight across the road. As we booked through Priceline I guess we were in one of the poorer located rooms just above the swimming pool but it was INCREDIBLE. We've been lucky enough to stay at some amazing 5 star hotels around the world but this was right up there with the best. The room was massive with a huge bed, sofa, chairs and beautifully appointed kitchenette. The bathroom was palatial with a huge spa bath, walk in shower and every conceivable amenity - including TV in the mirror. The appointment of the room was immaculate as were the fittings in the rest of the hotel. We wandered around a few other hotels on the Strip - Wynn, Bellagio, Encore and while we didn't see the bedrooms in those the common rooms in the Trump oozed an opulence and class that the others could not match. I think this is down to the fact that it is a hotel and not a casino hotel - so there are not loads of other people trapsing through the corridors or people smoking in the lobby (it is a non- smoking hotel) and it meant you could feel apart from the madness of Vegas but still have it (literally) on your doorstep. Also being across the road from the Mall meant that we had access to great food in the restaurants or food court. Having seen Trump on TV we were expecting something pretty gaudy but were very suprised, yes it had plenty of gold but it wasn't over the top mock versace like the Wynn. In the class stakes Trump definitely outscored Steve Wynn - haircut aside of course. The piece de resistance in the room was the bed which was heavenly. Sadly my wife was ill when we stayed but this meant that she got to spend plenty of time in bed which she described as like 'sinking slowly into a warm fluffy cloud'.

The bathroom was huge, with a whirlpool/jacuzzi style bath, two sinks and a tv in the mirror (cool!). The shower room was seperated by glass doors, as was the toilet. Cleanliness was 100%. The noise from other rooms and corridors was non-existant however you can hear the music from the pool which plays all day and the sound of the occasional passing train. It wasn't enough to cause annoyance or prevent sleep for us, but a light-sleeper might find the trains to be a problem. The gym and pool areas are kept to a high standard. However my only gripe is the constant music playing (often the same songs) quite loudly in the pool area. This makes it hard (almost impossible) to relax or read a book. The business centre is ok - quite small with 3 computers for which you can use the internet, it cost around $6 per 15 minutes and extra for printing which is a bit steep. In the fashion show mall food court you'll find it for $10 per 30 mins and there is a little soul food cafe off the strip (just north of encore) which has it for $5 for 30 mins. We ate at the DJT restaurant for breakfast one morning. It was nice food but the prices weren't on the menu. We were a little shocked when the bill came and it was over $60 for breakfast!

I recently stayed at the Trump while attending a conference in Las Vegas. I chose the Trump because it was a non-smoking facility that was not on the strip. My sixteen month old baby and husband accompanied me on the trip. We checked in on Wednesday and checked out on Sunday. During our 4 nights at the Trump, we had to be moved three times. We checked in around midnight and by 6 a.m.,we were up because the hotel had decided to begin construction that early in the morning. A loud jack hammering sound woke my son up and he refused to go back to bed. We asked to be moved and we were moved to a new room. When we walked into our new room, it was filthy. There were crumbs on the counter, lint all over the chair, the furniture looked beaten up, and my toddler found leftover orange seeds embedded into the carpet. I was appalled and asked to be moved again. In between our second and third move, the fire alarm went off. Frightened out of my mind and sleep deprived, I grabbed my baby and began my journey down the stairs from the 56th floor. On the 28th floor, we were turned back and told that it was merely a test. We moved into a room on the 40th floor. This time, no bellman came to help us with our luggage and we dragged our things down ourselves. The room on the 40th floor was no better. My toddler found an old, moldy toothbrush under the nightstand and an old McDonald\u2019s cup and straw that had been left by someone who had stayed in the room before. Exhausted from moving and not having slept enough, we decided that it wasn\u2019t worth it to request another room. We spoke to the manager and the best he could do was waive the $11 internet fee and the $15 a night resort charge that we had not even known about when we first booked the hotel. This hotel is not a four star hotel. The housekeeping staff seems to be overworked or underpaid. The rooms are not clean. My son spilled cheerios on the carpet and for the four days we stayed in our third room, the cheerios remained there.

Something I appreciated is that there was ZERO noise from neighboring rooms and the hallway. Thats one thing i really HATE about some hotels and fortunately, this room was super quiet and private. THANK YOU TRUMPY! The bathroom is HUGE with a big shower, plenty of space for two.. with a big jacuzzi tub and a built in TV in the vanity mirror! Spotless space with plenty of towels. They only give you two soap bars, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and a shower cap. Nothing special. The bed was big and soft and super comfy. The kitchenette was well equipped with everything you'd need, except napkins! Anyhoo, the kitchen comes with pots, pans, silverware, plates, cups, mugs, wine glasses, salad spinner, pot holders, spatulas, place mats.. all sorts of stuff. One thing I noticed is that they forgot to take the used coffee filter thingy out of the coffee machine. Minor mistake, no biggie. They wash your dishes for you everyday. YEAH! LOVE IT! Also, they give you a few bottles of water every day which I appreciated. We were on kind-of-a budget so we took cereal from home and just bought milk from the Walgreens down the road. It helped to save a few bucks for breakie. We also brought our leftovers from the restaurants we went to so the fridge and microwave came in handy. Hey, times are tough! Gotta do, whatcha gotta do, right? We had a city view (39th floor). We heard the train passing by the first night but only because we were still awake around 2am. It wasn't that bad though.

I noticed people waiting a bit for their cars at the valet. But they seemed to only wait 5-10 minutes. We just walked and took the DEUCE bus everywhere. It wasn't bad at all but we really like walking so it depends I guess. Also, something really nice was that they day we checked out, we went downstairs to leave our suitcases with the front desk because our plane didn't leave until 7pm and the front desk guy offered to extend our checkout until 4PM! At this point it was 11am and we had other things planned but we thought it was a nice gesture! Next time we'll take them up on it. I appreciated that it is a non-smoking hotel.

My daughters thought they saw Clinton from \"What Not to Wear\" while we were there, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Trump is popular with celebrities as it has such an insulated, peaceful atmosphere as compared with the casino hotels. It is difficult to walk to the strip due to the lack of crosswalks and sidewalks in the area. From experience, I think the best way is to cross directly from the Trump porte cochere to Nordstrom's porte cochere (entering through the men's department), walk straight through (go around escalators) and you will see a mall map straight ahead. We would usually walk to Neiman Marcus and exit near the Tickets4Less storefront. Once outside, turn right and walk to LV Blvd, \"the strip.\" There is a bus stop right in front of the mall for the double-decker \"Deuce\" buses. These are the tourists' best friends as they stop up and down the strip and even go downtown to Fremont. Fare is exact-change-only!! Prices are $3 one way, $7 for 24-hour unlimited pass, and $15 for 3-day unlimited pass. Tickets4less is a good source for show and meal tix, but check the best prices online before buying. One of their best values is a $2 coupon which gets you Harrah's Flavor's buffet for 1/2 price ($8 for lunch, $18? for supper which includes bottomless soda/milk/juice). They had snow crab legs when we went for supper but it was overcooked. We thought the lunch was fabulous though. We got stuck in the Trump's elevator during our trip, and the management was very apologetic and compensated us for our trouble. In the evening, it is imperative to return to Trump through the mall or take a taxi at night if you aren't fast on your feet or can't see well.

I found that ridiculous....also RIDICULOUS were the room service prices (eggs, 2 sausage links, toast and hashbrowns were 26 dollars + 18% grat + room service fee + tax) The building which puts you in the mind of a park avenue condo building, also lacked the charm of having a staff that made you feel warm and welcomed like you were arriving to yur home destination every time you walked in the door... they were drab, impersonal and made you feel like you were bothering them by askign a question. The security features of this hotel are fantastic however. I appreciated the security camped out front of the elevators that checked for room keys...I appreciated the seperated area where you could answer the door without giving access to your room. I appreciated the inability to get your car without verification of ownership. what I didnt like was that you cannot call down for your car, the hotel lobby while casion-less is devoid of ANY activity, it was so dead, there was not light music being played, there was no activity at the down stairs bar/lounge area where one would typically come in a potentially be enticed to have a glass of wine and relax and chat with guests before retring to your room.

I had read all the reviews on Trip Advisor before, so I called the hotel the night before our arrival to confirm our reservation and to request a room away from the train. The woman on the phone was delightful and happily agreed to accommodate my request. Check-in on Friday was a breeze--the front desk was fully staffed and we were waiting less than 5 minutes. The young man that checked us in was very friendly and when I asked him to confirm we were in a room far from the train, he said that he'd moved us to a better room and the train noise should be minimal. We were on the 50th floor with a view of the Stratosphere, and when we saw our room we were delighted that we had been upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite! The room was beautifully appointed, with 2 full bathrooms and a separate master bedroom. The master bathroom was absolutely huge! We enjoyed massages at the Trump spa, which were wonderful. The spa itself was smaller than expected, but nice. We asked for discounts on the massages and received $50 off coupons (the massages are $150 each for 60 minutes, so that saved a chunk). We did not use the gym or the pool, though the resort fee included use of both. Since we were a group of 3, two of us slept in the king size bed in the master bedroom and the third slept on the pull-out sofa. Housekeeping came and made up the pull out bed for us (upon request). The \"real\" bed was quite comfortable; my friend on the pull-out said it was just \"okay.\" The first night, the train woke up my friend who is a very light sleeper. I had earplugs in, so I didn't hear it at all. The second night, the train woke up both the light sleeper and me (even with my earplugs), but we fell back to sleep shortly thereafter. We were on the 50th floor (there are 52 floors total), so just plan on hearing the train, especially if you are on a lower floor. We didn't hear any of our neighbors at all; in fact, we never saw anyone else on the 50th floor all weekend. Housekeeping came once daily; we left our room by around 10am each day and by the time we'd return (around 3 or 4pm), the room was made up. The housekeeping staff did a great job, too. We really liked the idea of pushing a button to indicate the room was ready to be made up or to not be disturbed instead of hanging a sign on the door like every other hotel out there. We knew about the resort fee, and given the deal I got on Priceline, I really didn't mind paying $15/day. They noted that it included use of the gym, pool, and in-room stocking of coffee/water, and some other things I can't remember. On Friday night, there was a great lounge singer in the lobby by the bar and we enjoyed listening to him while drinking raspberry lemon drop martinis (very good). The wait staff and bartenders were really friendly and came over to chat with us. As for getting to The Strip, you have a couple options. There are always cabs waiting in front of the hotel, so you can take a cab. If you want to walk, the fashion mall is directly across from the hotel entrance, however, there is no pedestrian crosswalk, and you must cross with care (there is a surprising number of cars that drive fast past the hotel, so watch out). If you walk through the mall, it can take awhile as it is a little confusing inside, so I'd give myself 15 or 20 minutes to find The Strip. Note that the mall closes at 9pm, so it's not a late-night option. If you decide to just walk down Fashion Show Drive straight from the hotel to The Strip, it takes about 5 minutes (not 20 minutes as some reviewers have said, unless they are really slow walkers). Also, there is not an erotic museum between the hotel and the strip, despite what you may have read in other reviews on here, and there aren't crazy people lingering along the walkway, so I wouldn't call it \"dangerous.\" It is important to note that the sidewalk on the side of the hotel is not continuous, and as you get closer to the strip, you will have to walk on the side of the road, which is a little scary if the drivers aren't paying attention. In my opinion, it would behoove the hotel to finish paving the sidewalk all the way to Las Vegas Blvd. for the safety of its guests. If you don't want to walk or pay for a cab, the hotel offers a free shuttle to the Wynn between 4pm and midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. We didn't take advantage of it, but the doorman offered every time we walked out! On Saturday night, we walked down to The Mirage to see \"LOVE\" and it took us 30 minutes total, door to door. We are all in pretty good shape, but I don't think we were walking exceedingly fast (we were in heels!), so hopefully that gives you an idea of how far the Trump is from other hotels. All in all, the Trump is my new favorite hotel in Vegas. It was nice not to have my hair smelling like smoke all weekend, I didn't miss the \"ding-ding-ding-ing\" of slot machines in the lobby, and the staff went out of their way to make us happy. If the weather had been nicer, I would have loved to take advantage of the pool as it looked really relaxing.

She put us in unit 5728, on the 57th floor with a direct view high above the city with a perfect strip view. Amazingly, we could hear the train during the day, but never noticed it at night. We were able to see the Bellagio water show. Before the wife and I had a chance to finish bringing in our belongings, the kids were so excited about the jucuzzi tub. Be warned, just add alot less shampoo than you normally would for a bubble bath. With the jets on, it made a mountain of bubbles and the kids could hide in it. The unit was top-notch. The maid service was perfect. Everything was replenished, dishes washed, even the sofa bed was made up for us. Put the minifridge on the coldest level and your drinks will get cold fast and freeze. The pool area wasn't impressive, just functional. It was heated though and the kids still had alot of fun. Service there was also very nice. A life guard grabbed us towels and escorted us to a large, padded lounger that could fit several people. When the pool closed, they allowed us to keep the kids wrapped up in the pool towels up to the room instead of having to return the towels at the pool and have the kids go up cold. The kids ages are 6, 4 and almost 2. The hotel is non-smoking and we really appreciated breathing clean air. By the way, the lobby area smells great. Sounds weird, but you notice it.

Stay at any of the mega resorts, and its a hike to the elavator from your room, then thru the casino before you get to the strip. Its probably about the same time. Most of us are gluttons while in Vegas and could use the walk to burn a few calories anyway. The location is great because you have the convenience of the mall across the street and 5 star resorts like Encore, Wynn, Palazzo, and Venetian very close by. Check-out was smooth, no hidden fees, just the expected resort fee. The valet wait wasn't long at all and we checked out on a Sunday. My brothers were at the Encore, checked out on a Monday, and waited for a half hour for their vehicle. After driving away, we realized we left some clothes hanging in the closet. We called the Trump, turned around, and the maid had already prepared it for security to bring down to us. It was truly a perfect overall experience.

The Hotel is a little bit out but by no means to far, one main benefit was that it was quiet because there is no casino in the hotel. when we checked in they swiped our Visa and told us there was a $200 deposit which could be charged for any damage to the hotel property, also there was a daily $15 + tax resort charge, we asked what this was for and we were told it covered things like car parking, use of the Gym and swimming pool and incidentals used in the room, we said we were not happy to pay this charge but were told it was compulsary. The rooms was beautiful, very large and had everything we needed. you can even cook in the room if you want. being English we wanted some Tea, which was not in the room, when we rang Housekeeping we were told we would have to pay for the Tea bags and $5 for them to be sent to the room. we had several minor problems in the room but when we reported them they sent someone up quickly to put them right. All the staff were VERY friendly and could not do enough for us. Drinks are very expensive wherever you go in Vegas and vertually everywhere you go if you want to sit at a table and just have a drink you are told you have to sit at the bar unless you are having food, we though this was strange as there were many empty tables. when we came to check out we told the receptionist about our various problems and that we did not think we should pay the $15 a day resort charge, he had a word with the Manager and the charges were dropped. On the Strip going towards Downtown there were two great places for Breakfast, Peppermill which was the dearest and Denys they were exellent and you were seated quickly. We all had a fantastic stay, one week was not long enough for us, we never stopped but did not see everything. We caught a Taxi back to the airport, the driver was really friendly, the Taxi bill was $15 we were so pleased we gave him $20.

If you are travelling from England and are unsure whether to stay here, then this is my suggestion. Stay if you want a smoke free environment and no casino - this is purely a 5 star hotel with no gambling facilities - if you want to gamble - this is LAS VEGAS - Casinos are everywhere! You will have a modern kitchenette in your room for cooking. If you enjoy the environment of a top class hotel, this is for you. Each room has a jacuzzi bath and TV installed into the bathroom mirror. Views from the higher floors are out of this world. If you want to be on the strip with a casino on the ground floor with people getting hammered 24/7 and the bustle of the gambling arena, then go for a lesser hotel on the strip. It may suit you more. Also, Trump charges a compulsory hidden $15 per night ameneities fee which bumps up your price which gives you access to the pool and spa...but when the sun is out, you tend to feel it as the sun reflects off the tower to the pool area. Also, you may read bad reviews on valet parking. It takes about 3-5 minutes for them to bring up your car. We are holidaying, why does it matter! It is not a problem. Like most strip hotels, the services offered in the hotel are expensive, but it is Vegas living after all. Overall, great friendly staff and a top class hotel which should be experienced.

This is not what you expect from a 5-star hotel. Some notes: - The ventilation system does not work very well, because of this you hear a lot of noise from outside, for example a lot of cars from the freeway closeby, a train every hour and - I noticed a lot of things being broken: doors that do not close properly, handles that are loose, a toiletseat that is not fixed which caused me to nearly fall off the toilet, a broken lamp, broken tv in the bathroom, broken checkout computer-system, .. In a real 5-star hotel most of these would have been fixed. - The staff was not what you expect from a 5-star hotel. The bell-boy just dumps your bags right after the door, the concierge does not really help out and when we walked to our hotel-room we needed to show our hotel-key to a doorman that looked like a bouncer from a nightclub. The inside of the closet was really dirty and somebody just walked into the room at 9pm when the do not disturb light was on. You have to pay extra for everything you use. You have to pay a mandatory $15,- resort fee for things like water and newspaper, but that does not included internet (an extra charge) or use of pool (also an extra charge) or overnight parking (I believe a $15,- charge per night which is very expensive for vegas).

I liked having less foot traffic in the lobby, which for me, made it more relaxing coming back from the strip. But, if gambling is your thing, The Trump is only a short walk to casinos. So in short- The lobby and rooms are very nice and clean. The pool was simple but adequate. There are plush lounge chairs with pool side service. The gym and spa (although i didn't use either) seemed sufficient. The Trump is very close to the Wynn (Tryst) and I saw Jersey boys at the Palazzo which was a very close walk.

I was disappointed with the location, because to do anything, you must go outside and walk to shopping, dining or a casino. The Trump has one restaurant and a poolside snack bar and has no casino. I am not a wimp about walking, but the location did get annoying as the trip progressed. The rooms were fine, nothing special. The pool area looks similar to one you would find in your local gym with more seating and probably a slightly larger pool. My biggest problem with the Trump was the service. If this is the service one expects in a five star hotel, then I will happily stay at the Red Roof Inn. After being out of my room from 8:00a.m. to 2:30 p.m. I returned to find my room uncleaned and a message waiting for me. Housekeeping said they could not clean my room because the do not disturb button was lit. I explained to them that no button at all was lit because it was broken. They offered to clean my room immediately. I said great, I would go to the gym for an hour. After my time at the gym, I was starving but found the poolside snack bar was closed for a private party. Since I was very hot and sweaty, a trip outside the hotel for food did not seem like a good idea. I decided to take a shower and head out in the world for food. I got back to my room and it was still not cleaned. I called and they started talking about the light again. I explained that it was broken once again and they agreed to clean immediately. After a half hour of waiting, still no housekeeping. I went to the pool to get clean towels and threw my dirty towels into the hallway. After my shower I called housekeeping again. Once again we had the discussion about the light. They brought my towels, picked up the old ones out of the hallway and offered to clean my room. I told them I had to get dressed and dry my hair first. To make a long story a little longer, when my husband and I returned to our room around 10:00 p.m. it had still had not been cleaned. I made a call to housekeeping and just begged for some coffee for the morning. We talked about the light again, and I told them to never mention the light to me again. They did show up with the coffee and offered to clean the room, but I declined. Housekeeping was actually not my biggest complaint! We started out on the wrong foot with the bell desk at the beginning of our trip. My husband asked them to bring up packages to our room that had been delivered for his business meeting. We went down to the desk the next morning and they retrieved our boxes from storage, handed them to us and never offered to deliver them to our room. We were on our way out, but trudged up to our room with several boxes unaided. On the morning of our departure we called the bell desk to pick up our luggage. We had a ton of it because this was a multi city trip. After fifteen minutes of waiting we carried the luggage downstairs ourselves. I went to the bell desk and asked them where they had been. The bell captain looked confused so I said never mind. I did then ask him to retrieve our golf clubs out of storage. He brought the golf clubs to the bell desk, and then three bell people stood by talking to each other while I wrestled all of our luggage outside. (my husband was in a long line checking out). I thought they liked to help people so they would get tips, but it must work differently at Trump. I was actually making quite a disturbance trying to muscle the hard shell golf carriers out the revolving door, but no one saw fit to lend a hand. I would be really upset with this hotel if we had not only paid $114.00 a night for the room. We paid an economy price for economy service. You can get a room now for $89.00, and that is close the rate of a super budget hotel. You won't be disappointed with the service!

We were hoping to get the Wynn or the Venetian, as we did on our last trip. So, initially, we were a little bummed, particularly after reading that the Trump had no Casino, charged a $15/night mandatory resort fee, and was a bit of a walk to the Strip. It turned out, though, that none of these things were a very big deal and we had an excellent stay at this property. The walk to the Wynn/Strip is a short, pleasant, 5-minute jaunt. Moreover, you can enter Nordstrom\u2019s across the street and walk through the mall to the strip. We also found the Trump lobby to be pleasantly scented, which we much preferred to the ubiquitous cigarette smell that perpetually wafts through all Vegas casinos. The resort fee, on the other hand, is lame (if you have no choice but to pay, they should just include it in the price of the hotel rather than make their guests feel that the hotel is trying to cheat them out of a few bucks). However, it does come with some nice perks such as late check-out, a choice of a range of newspapers, 2 free small bottles of water per day, use of the pool and access to the fitness center. Concerning the paper, we did get the Sunday NY Times (eventually), which I would have had to search all over town for and buy for $5. On Monday, though, I received no paper. I\u2019m sure a call to the front desk would have rectified this, but I still had the NY Times magazine from Sunday, so didn\u2019t bother. We also made use of the late check-out (until 4pm), which is convenient if you have a later flight. We never tried the pool or the fitness center, but hear both are quite nice. The service at the trump is outstanding! Over the course of our stay, I requested extra clothing hangers, a down pillow, regular coffee (we only had de-cafe in our room) and a newspaper (on Sunday the times hadn\u2019t yet been delivered at 7am, but they said they would run a copy up as soon as it arrived); all items were brought immediately and the operator, Jasmine, was very pleasant. In fact, everyone we spoke with at the hotel was very kind and accommodating. The only slight exception is the maid service. In addition to not providing regular coffee, they failed to refill our conditioner (which was empty). The studio suites at the Trump are among our favorites on the strip. We still slightly prefer the rooms at the Venetian (we like their living room area a bit more and prefer the extra flat screen to the half kitchen \u2013 it\u2019s more esthetically pleasing if less functional). The Trump, though, has a far superior bathroom (a Jacuzzi tub and a cool TV built into the mirror) and the fridge in the kitchen/living room is a nice touch. The beds are very comfortable and, provided you get a suite facing the strip, the views are spectacular. We were in 2827 and had an incredible view of the Encore, the Wynn, the Palazzo, the Venetian, Treasure Island, and the Mirage. Strip view rooms are supposed to be an extra $40/night, but we politely requested an upgrade at check-in and they gave it to us. While it\u2019s clearly a 5-star resort, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worthy of a 5-star review given the resort fee, the coffee, conditioner and newspaper. These are obviously very small issues and I expect they won\u2019t have much impact on most readers\u2019 stay. For those that stay at the trump, I would like to pass on a few of additional recommendations. Esthetically, the Encore casino (about a 6-minute walk) is our favorite on the strip. Rather than the dark drabness of most casinos \u2013 which can make one feel a bit claustrophobic \u2013 the Encore is bright with high white ceilings; cool red chandeliers; and richly-colored, upholstered walls. My favorite poker rooms, though, are the Wynn and the Venetian. Both have top-notch dealers, complimentary drinks with many top-shelf liquors (if requested), and over a dozen flat screen TV\u2019s, etc\u2026 We also liked Dal Toro for breakfast. It\u2019s at the Palazzo, with outside seating and good eggs benedict \u2013 they use toasted sourdough and some parmesan cheese, which is a nice twist. We didn\u2019t like the buffet at Beliggio, though. The food was just okay and the ambience is that of a Denny\u2019s. It may be worth the $15 on weekdays, but not the $25ish on weekends. If you want to do a buffet, I recommend paying the extra few dollars and going to the Wynn.

The spa is relaxing and the service AT THE SPA is stellar. I had a wonderful, relaxing massage. My host was very polite. My facial made my skin glow. I did have a pedi, which was adequate enough. The extra little touches found at the spa seem to be missing from the salon. I had the breakfast buffet in the restaurant each morning, and the food was very good: omelettes to order, thick bacon, ripe fruit, and happy pancakes. The service was not even close to 5-star. There was a LINE to check in. Hire more desk staff, PLEASE. The waitress at the bar was awful - it took SO LONG to get each of our rounds it was laughable. Now, they staff was not rude at all. They spoke to us politely. They just weren't good at their jobs. There is a $15 resort fee. They really need to just add $15 to the price of the rooms, and stop lying to people about the fee. It's not like it's an optional fee, so in my mind it's just a way to force you to pay more for your room than you agreed to at reservation. It does not pay for anything. You have to pay $22 a day to use the facilities and you have to pay for parking. A half bottle of water does not cost $15. I never received a newspaper, which is another item they claim the \"fee\" pays for. I would be less upset about the \"resort\" fee if I wasn't treated like an idiot by being lied to about it's purpose. Let's also be honest about the fact that a 5-star hotel is supposed to include these things, not charge extra for them. Lastly, this hotel is far removed from the strip. I know that you have to take cabs everywhere in Vegas, but sometimes it's nice to look out and see the goings on - or step outside and walk the strip a bit. You certainly can't do that from The Trump.

I\u2019m a frequent traveler to Vegas and enjoy the excitement of the city. Even though I am not a gambler, I like the entertainment that casinos offer. The Trump Hotel doesn\u2019t have a casino so there livelihood of the hotel is suffering. But the positive to that is not having to navigate your way through the casino to make it back to the room after a long night out. The lobby is attractive and smells wonderful. As others have stated, there is a $15/day resort fee for the use of the pool, workout facilities, etc. I did not use those amenities but still had to pay for them, which was ok by me but I would have preferred for this charge to be included in the cost of the room and not a surprise when I check in. The room, a one-bedroom suite was nice and cozy. The kitchenette was convenient and the bathroom was huge. I expected any room I got in Vegas to have a choice of one king or two queen/double beds but Trump\u2019s one bedroom suites only come with one queen bed and a pullout sofa. Needless to say this was a little disappointing for me and my guest but since I got my room through Priceline, there was nothing we could do about it. Another disappointment was the noise of the train and its loud horn. It comes through around 1 am, 4 am, and throughout the day. Making your way to the strip is not as convenient as other properties. You can go through the Fashion Show Mall instead of walking down the partial sidewalk or take a taxi. A taxi ride to Caesar\u2019s Palace (Forum Shops) is about $10. There is no self parking but you can easily park across the street in the Nordstrom\u2019s, but unexpected for a 5 star hotel. The staff was ok for the most part. One evening my guest forgot her key to the room and the security would not let her up. They told her they always have someone to check the guests who use the elevators to ensure they are guests of the hotel. Strange, we were there Thur-Sun and that was the one and only time we saw anyone checking for room keys. The only onsite restaurant, DJ T, was ok. There are much better places on the strip to eat. Trying to get a taxi, don\u2019t rely on the hotel staff. We were not ready for the maid service when they came Saturday to clean the room. You\u2019re instructed put the housekeeping light on once maid service can come back. We did so at 1pm and left the room to go shopping. We returned at 5pm and the room was still not cleaned. At 6pm we called in a complaint and requested towels to be brought up. That never happened. We showered again and left the room at 8:30pm with the maid service indicator still on. We arrived back to the hotel @ 3:30am and our rooms keys would not work. We tried to use the phones in the hall to have staff come bring us new keys but the phones did not work so we had to go downstairs to get them. At this point I was very disappointed in the Trump and expressed my concerns to the manager. He offered to upgrade our room but we were checking out in a few hours so there was no point. The only other thing they offered was to waive the $15/day resort fee. The last disappointment I encountered was an e-mailed reservation confirmation for another night at the Trump Hotel and the charge for $99 plus tax! I was shocked since I paid for my stay Thur-Sun on Priceline. I called the hotel, spoke with management and they refunded my cc for the charge of the extra reservation.

I have done both, but I travel for pleasure so much that I couldn't review all of my wonderful or marginal experiences. I am taking time to write this review to warm other travelers to Vegas of the disappointment they may experience staying at this inappropriately labeled 5 star hotel in a city with many more better choices. I suggest this hotel for business travelers who are habitual gamblers and must stay away from casino hotels. It is also good for couples or individuals who dislike Vegas and are forced to visit the city and wish to remain alienated from the cities energy. I travel to Vegas about 6 to 8 times a year. I am not a big gambler, but enjoy the energy of the city as well as the restaurants, shows and night life. I have stayed at most of the 4 and 5 star hotels up and down the strip and was anxious to experience the Trump. It was a total disappointment from the moment I walked through the door. When I arrived at 11pm the hotel was dead. There was no one at the bar, in the lobby and most importantly, there was no one to check me in. I walked around the corner behind the podium and announced myself in hopes someone would be in the back room. There was no one. I walked outside and asked the bellman if there was anyone working the front desk. Finally, after about 10 minutes (or more) someone showed up. I was check in and told about the $15 resort fee. I know this has been covered by other reviewers so any guest should be prepared. Resort fees, however, are a sore subject for me as I find them deceptive ways to make additional revenue without fully disclosing the charges to customers when booking a reservation. I can only hope one day that legislatures take note of this fraudulent charge and make all 'resort fees' illegal. I loath that I am charged a fee that covers parking a car when I arrived by taxi and that is not the norm for any other hotel in Vegas. The fee also covered things for which I never use like the newspaper (I use the Internet), coffee (no thanks), pool (it was empty and being repaired), and bottled water (I can pick this up at the mall for a fraction of the fee). Scam. More importantly, the hotel is not on the strip and currently inconvenient for walking to the strip except during daylight hours. If you are unfortunate to be caught staying at this hotel and are reading the review I suggest that you use the mall to transverse the walk to the strip. If you cross the street and turn left you can take the walk into the parking garage and then enter the mall from the doors on the left underground. Then, walk straight ahead and you can get to the strip. At night, forget it. Once the mall is closed walking back to the hotel appeared dangerous because of a lack of sidewalks and lighting. There are so many wonderful restaurants on the strip that I never did try lunch or dinner at the hotel. I did think it was important to give it a try for breakfast. What a disappointment. The day I was there I was the only one in the small part of the restaurant that is cordoned off for breakfast service. I felt like I was staying at an old hotel that had to create a place to serve guests breakfast. Then, the prices were a little high for my independent traveling budget. Okay, I am complaining about money twice in this posting and I am the first to dislike other postings that focus on cost and not the experience. If you have a beverage (coffee, tea or soda), orange juice, oatmeal and a bread you will pay more than $30. I know Vegas is expensive these days, but this place doesn't offer atmosphere or a unique dining experience. At least the nearby Wynn and Palazzo have places with style and excitement for breakfast. The hotel looks like a designers potpourri from a gaudy classless Greek lobby to a lifeless neoclassical elevator area to a modern dysfunctional hotel room. It appears to me that no one could agree on one cohesive look and feel for the property. The hotel room would be impressive in New York, but it is less impressive than competing hotel rooms at the Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, The Hotel and others on the strip. On one trip to Vegas I sampled The Signature hotel which is a condominium complex connected to the MGM via a long, and I mean very long, covered walkway. The Trump isn't connected to anything. You are forced to rely on taxis, driving or walking to get to any activity besides watching the car valet or lone bartender organizing his bottles. I would guess that very few of the guests return to this hotel after their first stay. I talked with a couple of other people who were staying at the hotel and disappointed ruled. One can only feel sorry for the investors who purchased rooms at this property as an investment. At night, if you want turn down service you need to call housekeeping and put in your request. If you don't request the service it wont happen automatically. I find this to be the case with many hotels. I find it inconvenient to remember to make that call every evening before going out. Over the course of my stay I did think that the service people were friendly and tried to help.

Unlike some, who have done the same, and expected the Venetian, Palazzo, etc., we figured it would be the Trump. We were correct. The hotel is nice. It is clean, and certainly stands out, with it's sparkling gold color, in the sun. The rooms are nice, and certainly not a typical hotel room. I don't think, however, that the hotel warrants 5 Star status. Upon check-in, you are hit with a $15 per day fee, which is called a \"resort fee\", and includes use of the pool, the fitness center, and receiving a newspaper (of which you have several choices), in your room, each day. I do not agree with this fee, especially since it is hidden until check-in. Most 5 Star hotels include such services, for no additional charge. I was disappointed at being charged this fee, after not receiving the newspaper during our first day, and finding that the pool was drained, and down for maintenance. How do you charge someone for \"use of the pool\", knowing that the pool is drained, and down for maintenance. The hotel is noisy, at night, due to the train, and I believe, also, the monorail, which is probably the \"whistling\" noise that some describe. The train and monorail run late at night, and early in the morning. If you are not a hard sleeper, it may cause you issues getting to sleep. The location of Trump, is not really on the strip, even though it is advertised, on HotWire, as being \"central strip\". It is a good 5-7 minute walk, to get to the strip. It also involved a walk down a side road, with no sidewalk, which can be dangerous, considering there is traffic, especially at night. Not safe for anybody, especially children. We had no problems with room service. Our room was cleaned both days, of our stay. The bar at the Trump has a very nice staff, and great drinks. Definately try it out. We did not try the restauraunt, but the menu is limited, and pricy. It also isn't a menu that would appeal to children, if you stay with children at the Trump. We had no problems with the staff, but our check-in, and check-out was a bit cold. We were not met with a very \"welcoming\", and \"glad you stayed with us\", type of attitude. More of a, \"here are your keys, this is your room\", now be on your way, at check-in, and a \"here is your bill, now be on your way\", at check-out. Considering the \"5 Star\" rating, you would expect to be greeted at check-in, as though you are appreciated a little more, as well as thanked at check-out. It wasn't as though we were treated rudely, but it just wasn't a warm, welcoming attitude, that you would expect at a 5 Star hotel. In the end, I can't say I wouldn't recommend the Trump, but I think you would have a better experience, and stay, in the heart of the strip, at other hotels - where you'll actually spend less money. The last time I was in Vegas, I stayed at the Monte Carlo, which was much cheaper (especially when considering no $15 \"resort fee\"), and very nice, as well. It was actually, \"on the strip\". The Trump is also a place of residence, as many of the condo's, and rooms are actually owned by people. I think this may play a part in not getting the full \"hotel\" experience that one might expect. It is also, because of it being a residential building, that it doesn't have a casino. I am not a gambler, and didn't mind this. Others may enjoy this as well. For the typical Vegas traveler, however, the Trump can seem a bit removed from the typical Vegas atmosphere.

So, be careful if you have a flight to catch. Better off park across street (Nordstrom) if you are going in and out.

I was not sure how I would feel about staying in Vegas in a hotel without a casino but thought I'd give it a try since the price was right and most hotels were booked (we were there for CES). Upon arriving we experienced the quiet sophistication of a high end hotel with out the loud slot machines, lights and cigarette smoke Vegas is known for. The check in was painless, the staff at the front desk was very polite. Going up to our room we were pleased to find we were on the 58th floor, facing the strip. This made for an absolute beautiful view at night as we could see clear from one end of the strip all the way down to Mandalay (the opposite end), it was truly a spectacular view. The room was very large, well appointed, a very comfortable bed, a couch, chairs, coffee table, desk, microwave, fridge, cooktop, blender, toaster, big closets, lots of drawers. All this and the room did not feel cramped at all. The bathroom was gorgeous, very big marble, flat screen in the mirror, enormous tub, beautiful shower. I also like the location of the hotel. It is set a bit back from the strip, yet is right across the street from Fashion Show Mall, and on the other side of the street is the Wynn, Palazzo, and Venetian. The Bellagio is a painless 1 mile walk (or 8 dollar cab ride). Anyway point being, we went to those hotels to gamble and then did not have to walk back through a casino to get to our room, or in the morning. Ok now to the service issues. Before arriving at The Trump I attempted to make use of the renowned \"attache services.\" I was requesting they fill our fridge with beverages we wanted during our stay. I e-mailed and after a couple days heard back. I had a couple questions and she never responded back. I thought this was disappointing as it is touted as one of the highlights of the hotel. Annoying. Upon arriving to our room, our fridge had something spilled in it (yuck), and our water bottles which are supposed to be in each room (as part of the \"resort fee\") were not there. The gentlemen who brought our luggage checked these things and appeared very unhappy with the oversights, again he was very kind and assured us it would be taken care of, and it was. Our friends were also missing the water bottles out of their room, as well as a bathrobe. These may seem insignificant but for a hotel that really prides itself on its service, we a little surprised at the oversights. I did order room service and it came very quickly and was delicious but set my tray in the hallway to be picked up (around 3 in the afternoon) and when we left to check out the next morning it was still there. Overall the employees that we came in contact with were VERY nice and helpful, it were the ones you didn't see who seemed to not be doing their jobs.

In terms of the room only, the Trump is nice. It's very similar to the Signature, though with slightly less square footage and no balconies. The room fittings may be of slightly higher quality than the Signature, beautiful sinks in the bath and lots of tasteful marble. Rooms are a couple of years newer than the Signature, so may be fresher. We checked in just after 3pm on New Years Day. The front desk attendant was pleasant, but said our room wasn't ready yet. We really didn't feel like waiting -- there were a lot of people in the lobby obviously already waiting for their room, so I asked if there were any upgraded rooms available. We ended up upgrading to a premium corner suite 1 bedroom for another $100 a night so we wouldn't have to wait. Our room was on the 19th floor and had a bathroom as big as the bedroom, with a large window over the tub. Unfortunately, the view was mostly of the freeway and parking lots. Would've been cool to have a higher floor and strip view... The Trump charges $15 a day now in a resort fee which I wouldn't have minded -- if internet was included -- but that's an extra $12 a day (again, the Signature fee includes wifi). The resort fee includes bottled water and coffee -- the water wasn't replenished the 2nd day, there was only 1 coffee cup in the kitchen, and the only creamer available was a hazelnut cream cremora flavor. Bed and linens were the least comfortable of any high end hotel I've stayed in in the past year, including the Palazzo, Palms Place, and the Sig. Room service took an hour and a half to arrive. Food was good quality, but by the time it got to us we wished we'd just gone out for breakfast. In sum, the hotel is a beautiful facility, clean, and it should be excellent, but it's obviously understaffed, and too many little things added up to make it a really good hotel.

There was a nice gym and swimming pool, the area was clean and tidy with a good selection of sun loungers with a plentiful supply of towels.

We spoke to reception, there was no quibble, and they could not have been more apologetic, they told us that the carpets had been washed and this maybe the problem. They asked us if we would mind moving and said they would upgrade us to a suite by way of apology. The suite was fantastic, it had every amenity, kitchen with cooker, freezer, and dishwasher, bar area and dining/sitting areas, plasma type screens in both the dinning and bedroom. The bed was very comfortable, my partner and myself had a great nights sleep, the air conditioning was great throughout the property.

The whole property was well maintained. The staff on the door were great, always happy to help, calling taxis or giving advice, looking after luggage etc. The only negative is that the railway line runs quite close to the hotel and the trains blast their whistle/horn while going through the level crossing.

Expecting to be pampered by great accommodations and customer service we were appalled by how we were treated during our stay and afterwards. We arrived on a Friday evening and called from dinner to have the sofa bed turned down for us. (All the standard rooms all come with one king and a sofa bed. Since I was sick during my visit, I opted to sleep in a separate bed. Since they have no rooms with two doubles, that left one us to the sofa bed.) When we arrived back from dinner 2 hours later, the sofa bed had yet to be made up. Several additional calls later, someone from housekeeping finally came. Unfortunately, she made the bed wrong and did not give us a sheet - which meant I was forced to sleep with the comforter directly against me, which is kind of gross, considering they don't generally wash those things. We were too tired to try to call housekeeping again and I wasn't sure if that was just the way they made up beds at this hotel. I should have known better. Every time we called housekeeping we were automatically put on hold and eventually had to connect through the front desk. Needless to say, I didn't sleep that well. The bed was bowly and lumpy - but what can you expect from a sofa bed, I suppose. On Saturday, we left our room at around 11:00am and called housekeeping again to have our room made up. When we came back to our room at 3:30pm, no one had come. Once again we had to go through a song and dance to get someone from housekeeping. Someone finally came at 5:30pm. When we came back from dinner around 10:30 - surprise, surprise our room had not been turned down. Given that I was sick and running a fever, having to wait for housekeeping yet again to go to bed really stunk. After a few more calls, the floor manager finally arrived to convert our sofa bed and acknowledged that the sofabed had been totally made up wrong. She apologized and said that the hotel's occupancy rate for that night was the highest it had been since the hotel opened. I gotta tell you - that's no excuse. Rooms are booked in advance. Staff up, people. Sunday morning when we went to shower, we realized that housekeeping had not even touched/cleaned the shower area. Our shampoos and soaps had not been refreshed, and there was hair in the drain from the day before. When we checked out on Sunday, I complained at the front desk, Peter was sympathetic and offered to comp the meals that we had charged to the room, which I appreciated. He also offered an upgrade on our next visit. Given that I booked through hotwire and prepaid the room, there was nothing he could do in that department. When we were at the airport, my friend who was staying with me realized she left her ipod charger in the room. She spoke with Peter and he assured her that it would be sent out to her. It is now 1 month later, and she has had to call the hotel almost every other day to track it down. She was passed between the front desk, security, shipping...and everyone had a different answer as to where the charger is. She was told several times that it had been shipped. She was also told that UPS wouldn't accept it because they couldn't spell the work \"Patriot\" which was part of the address. She was even asked for her credit card number on several occasions, even though it was made clear to us that the cost of shipping would be covered by the hotel. Just today, they admitted to finding the charger which was lost (guess it wasn't really sent like she was told) and said that it was being sent to \"shipping.\" Needless to say, we are not holding our breath. I was shocked at the lack of respect given to us as customers. I definitely expected more from them. We will not be back free upgrade or not. I would not recommend staying here to anyone.

If you are a light sleeper, just don't go to Vegas. I personally fell asleep with the tv on and only woke up b/c I had so much to do in Vegas. The bathroom is one of the best. But watch out for the glass doors in the bathroom. They could have put as much thought into them as they did to most of the drawers in the room as the glass doors slam quite easily. I rate the hotel above avg as a hotel in itself. However, this is not a hotel for those of us who want to be close to the action. Do not stay here for your first trip to Vegas. There is no shuttle at this hotel. Not even one to the airport. The room has a fridge, tons of drawers, microwave, hd lcd tv that swivels on an arm, \"kitchen\" sink, phones all over (even in the bathroom) and a small tv in the mirror of the bathroom that you can watch while taking a nice bath in the jacuzzi. The room service menu is pretty limited and be sure not go order drinks when you order. I got the same thing twice for room service, once with a sprite and a coke and once without. The price difference was almost $20! It seemed like I was overcharged but I lost the receipt and paid in cash, so I didn't bother to dispute it although I should have. Go to the ABC store in the Fashion Show Mall across the street and put the fridge to good use. Checking in and checking out was fast as there aren't too many people staying here. The rooms were very clean and the whole hotel smelled very nice. The elevators are super fast so don't worry about staying in a room at a high level. My main gripe I have other than location is that everything here costs you. The wireless internet is $12/day; the internet access on the business center computer is $5.95/15minutes! And the fitness room costs $22/day! This is ridiculous if you ask me. Anyhow, if this hotel were further away from strip or in any other city, I would have given it an excellent rating. It is close enough to the strip to aggravate you with the walk b/c there is no shuttle to anywhere.

It was then that we noticed that the lobby/lounge area was completely full of people waiting for their rooms. We were given an option to wait (for an unspecified amount of time) for the room or leave our bags with the bellhop (for tip). We were not offered any compensation until we checked back (they waived the $14/day valet fee). Only after my friend was on the phone with them for nearly a full hour, did we get the keys to the room at around 3:30pm, but everyone else was still waiting for their rooms; some since Noon! When we went back out around 4:15pm, the same people were still waiting. At around 6:15pm, even more people were waiting both in the check-in line and in the lobby/lounge! This is not the way that anyone wants to begin a vacation. There is also a fee for smoking in the room. I don't smoke, but apparently the people in the adjoining room do, so the doorway area and our room kept smelling of smoke, so I had to call reception/security about it. Nevermind, the odor when it was promised to be smokefree. Reviews had talked about the long wait for the valet (for us 15 minutes at an off-peak time), so we opted for cabs at peak times. However, the queue for the cabs so we crossed the street to Nordstrom to get a cab there instead. At time of checkout, they had the valet fee on the bill, which I had to remind them that they'd promised to waive. All in all, the hotel ended up being the sole source of stress during our vacation.

Husband is frugal and appreciated the great value provided by booking this 5-star hotel with an online discounter (Hotwire). The hotel is a short walk from the action on the Vegas strip. Husband believes the fun is not at the destination, the fun is in the journey. Going from Trump to the strip: Jaywalk across street, cut through Nordtrom's(Fashion Mall), go through food court, cut through Neiman Marcus, across outdoor walking bridge, down escalator, through casino, up escalator, ride casino tram. Really only a 15-20 minute adventure and a good way for husband to work off a few calories. Wife doesn't need to work off calories and not thrilled about walking in dress and heels. Positives: A very nice hassle free hotel. Check in was easy. Rooms are huge and very nice. Pool and sundeck are great and very low key. Fitness room was well equipped but a bit on the drab side. I would have expected more in this area from Trump for the $22/day fee. Negatives: At certain times of day there were a lot of people trying to catch cabs.

There were no bathrobes in the closet either (they are supposed to have them in the room, the hangar was in the closet but empty). I will admit the staff corrected these problems but they should not have occurred. Our door key was not programmed to open the pool doors...had to get a new one.

Although they rent these units out as hotel rooms, this is in no way a typical Vegas Hotel. They should have left it as a condo building for residents only & not opened it to the typical tourist. The overall feel is like visiting your old grandmother on Park Ave: a high-end unit to sleep only & find any reason to get out! Simply nothing to do! Although this just might appeal to the older crowds? Meaning: it's smoke-free, non-gaming, & extremely quite. (except the train honking at all hours of the night). Like every other hotel I have stayed at in Vegas they have endless amenities to keep you from visiting the next hotel. Don't expect a cab to be waiting outside when you decide to go out (OFTEN). There is no cab stand. This hotel isn't on the strip so you will need to walk about 10mins to the nearest hotel. And if you drive, expect a mandatory $14 parking fee. (no-self parking)! So some more of my frustrations & lack of amenities. Only two front desk clerks so check-in took>30mins. Room was spacious with a kitchenette but had no mini bar? So this hotel has over 1200 rooms but only one restaurant/bar, & located in a museum like lobby? Which was very very quite! Oh and it doesn't stay open late. And forget about room service as it wasn't available after 1am? The only attractions are the pool area & spa/fitness room. The one & only pool is very basic & small, but did include a lounge area with bar & tvs. Again very quite & lack of people? Finally the fitness center. Nice cardio machines but limited weight machines & free weights. Oh, & it's $22! (with an empty frig & empty water cooler). Very annoying not to have water when working out. The spa didn't open until 9am so had to walk down the hall to get water from a warm water fountain. Like every hotel I have been too in Vegas there was always excitement in some way. Of all places, Circus Circus could do a better job of entertaining, seriously! If you're into extreme quite, very few people to see/be seen, & lack of amenities, give it a try.

We booked through Priceline and were bidding on a 5 Star hotel. We expected the Venetiian or the like. When we were told it was the Trump Tower we were shocked because there is no casino, live music or any type of entertainment. It's like a morgue. Plan on paying an extra $15 a day for valet.

I had stayed before at the Trump Tower in Atlantic City and remembered a lot of gaudy gold surroundings, but not much else other than the clean room. We were pleasantly surprised when we got to the Trump Tower, especially for the price ($144 per night)! First of all, the hotel is brand new and not crowded, unlike some other hotels on the Strip. The service from the moment we stepped out of the taxi was excellent from the doormen to the front desk to room service. Our room was great and I generally consider myself picky. The bathrooms are fantastic with a nice shower, a large tub, and a TV in the mirror on the vanity. The room itself has nice furnishings and was very comfortable -- even for a pregnant woman like me! The pool was a nice break from screaming revelers and children at other hotels. Most of the lounges had sun shades and the bar and wait staff were very attentive in terms of bringing out food and drinks promptly. Our room service order was delivered within 15 minutes of ordering it and was delicious. I also appreciated a reprieve from all of the smoking at the other casinos. There are some things to consider depending on what type of Las Vegas experience you are looking for: 1. There is no casino which my husband and I are fine with since we are not big gamblers, but if you came to gamble you might not enjoy it so much (or at all). The Wynn is a very easy 10 minute walk from the hotel. It might seem farther than it is when you first come down the street. 2. Extremely limited shopping and restaurants in the hotel itself. The Fashion Show Mall is directly across the street though. 3. Room service menu is limited. 4. Some of the amenities are limited, perhaps because the hotel is relatively new? I asked for bubble bath since the tubs in the rooms are perfect for relaxation, but they did not have any. The Front Desk said that this is a common request and that they would be correcting it within the next month. 5. I did hear the train once in the middle of the night that some previous people had written about, but I personally thought it was no big deal. We were on the 27th floor facing the Strip so maybe location does matter? Overall our experience was outstanding, considering we paid 4X what we paid for this room at Caesars for the same level of room quality.

Good luck crossing! LIke I said before, about a five minute walk each way, but if you leave the hotel twice a day, that's 20 minutes walking to and from this place down that crappy road. It would be a BIG problem for the elderly or someone who had trouble walking. The location keeps you away from noise from the Strip but you'll have to deal with a LOUD train whistle.

I had a room on the 56th floor and it sounded very loud. And here's the best part, it comes very early in the morning. Hoo-boy!

There were barely 10 people at the pool at any given time, they have great round 2 person lounge chairs with sun covers, the standard lounge chairs, pool floaties and also loungers in the pool. There are cabana's but they haven't completed them yet and 2 hot tubs. The room was good, nothing fantastic though. The huge bathroom with 2 sinks was great for 3 ladies all trying to get ready at the same time. The toilet and shower are enclosed glass areas for a bit of privacy (although see through). The room was made up nicely each day by the staff and we loved the complementary Trump slippers and drawers to keep your toiletries organized! The kitchenette as fine but they didn't have free tea (only coffee) and when the cleaning staff replaced the coffee they only brought decaf. When we asked for tea to be supplied as well as coffee they told us it would be an additional charge for tea. We also had to call and ask for cream, additional bedding, extra hangers, towels and dishes for the 3rd person as it wasn't supplied in the room (although we had made the reservation for 3 people). The staff was accomodating after the call but we shouldn't have to ask for items that should be supplied in the first place. There was a bat in the airconditioning unit a couple nights that was annoying for the first few hours but the train didn't bother us at least. I had read previous reviews about the train so I specified at check in that I wanted a room on the opposite side of the train and on a higher floor. We had room 5803. The view was fabulous (right down the strip toward Mandalay). The walk late at night from the strip (after the Fashion Show mall closes) is on a darker side street with no side walks. A little creepy for 3 ladies. I couple of tips: - Walk through the Fashion Show mall - it's cooler and makes the trip to the strip seem shorter (hours are usually 10am - 9pm) - Nordstrom's across the street has a great cafe on the 3rd floor. Delicious salads, sandwiches and pastas. - Tickets 2nite (discount show and restaurant tickets) is just across from the Wynn in the Fashion Show mall. We arrived at 11:30am and still got great tickets for Mystere's 7000 show. They also have discount buffet passes for Paris - fabulous food! - If you take a taxi from the Trump to Mandalay make sure the cab driver takes Industrial to Frank Sinatra Dr. The price of the trip will be $12 compared to $20 down the highway. - There is an ABC store in the Fashion Show mall to purchase bottled water, milk, booze, candy/snacks, cereals and some toiletry items. We found that quite handy as there was no other convienience stores close to Trump. Although this is my 6th trip to Vegas, I thought the Trump was quite lovely. It's nice to have a smoke free attentive hotel to return to after a long day on the strip. I suppose it's not going to be very popular with partying young adults but it's great if you're older than 35 and like to relax.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cTerrible train noise - don't stay here\u201d", "Author": "Lizzy-Lee", "ReviewID": "UR20262737", "Content": "6 of us stayed 2 nights in 3 rooms. The main problems with this hotel are 1) The hotel is right next to a freight train line that goes all night and the soundproofing is totally inadequate 2) rooms vary, especially in size of bathrooms but not in price 3) location - it feels quite a walk to anywhere and has views of a construction site We all had serious problems with the train noise. It is not just the trains, it is the blowing of their whistles. A friend described it as \"as if the train was coming right into the room\". No one got a full nights sleep. I slept at most 3 hours, listening to trains from at least 2am-5am, and then woke at 7am. The 2nd day I asked to be moved and was initially told this would cost an additional $40 as it was considered an upgrade. When i pointed out I should not have to pay extra just to get a quiet room I could sleep in, the manager was consulted and I was moved withuot charge. However this turned out even worse as the air con unit had some sort of loud droning buzzing noise that was especially loud in the bedroom. It could be heard over the TV. As I had moved rooms quickly before going out for dinner this wasn't apparent until I was in bed late at night and trying to get to sleep. It was so excessively loud I called the front desk. They offered to send someone up to \" see what it is and if it could be fixed\" but I got the distinct impression this was unlikely. They then agreed to move me but only on the condition I packed all my belongings up and took them. Given it was midnight by this stage and I was incredibly tired, I suggested that they should let me simply move somewhere to sleep but they insisted that my belongings could not be left in my room 'unattended'. Err ....isn't that what happens when you go out during the day? I begged them but the were adamant - pack up to move or stay where you are. I was so exhausted from no sleep the previous night I decided to cram the earplugs in & try to get to sleep. After an hour or so I finally did - apart from trains waking me up twice at 3am and at dawn and then finding the buzzing noise making it very hard to get back to sleep again. Unsurprisingly I was not at my best when I got up the next morning. Other points: Location is an issue as it is at the far end of the Strip and feels further given it is set back down the road. You can cut through the Mall across the road which helps. Room size varies. 2 People got roms with tiny bathrooms with showers over the bath and no shower curtain. If you do stay here a) don't pay too much - there are better options for the price b) Ask for a quiet room away from the trains and do not accept having to pay extra for the privilege c) use the Mall as the short cut to get anywhere The only plus is that the rooms are equipped with a kitchenette, including coffee making, fridge, microwave and stove top. I do like being able to make a cup of tea or coffee in the morning. Overall this really spoiled my stay as I was so tired both days I had less energy for walking around and sightseeing, and could barely make it through dinner.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious accommodations and a staff with a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude.\u201d", "Author": "photogrrl", "ReviewID": "UR20019398", "Content": "This hotel is just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip.

We found out that this hotel is not rated yet because it was open only 5 month ago and only after 1 year it can be rated. It started with the fact that non of the rooms have 2 beds only one king + sofa bed. When we open the sofa-bed, we found a very very thin and soft mattress with lots of coils sticking out of it in a way that you absolutely cant sleep on it. We asked for another mattress like the one they have on the main bed (which was also too soft ) but they said they can't give us a mattress like that, only another one like the one we have on the sofa bed. I have to say that the staff that we spoke with were not kind at all the only things that they came up with were that they can give us another room but we need to pay for it or that they can help us find another hotel which I explain to them more then 10 times that we already paid for this hotel through Priceline, but they kept suggesting this stupid idea over and over again. Other then that I can just say that the Jacuzzi in the bathroom was really nice until we operate it and found out that it was filthy, lots of dirt came out of the pipes \u2014 it was really disgusting. The pool was just a regular rectangular pool with no trees or anything special like you would expect from any hotel in Las Vegas and particular from a 5 star hotel.

The security guard at the entrance to the elevators was extremely rude. During my three night stay, the same guy asked me for my room key three times. On two of those occasions, he ignored other well dressed White gentlemen to ask me. Those occasions embarrassed my wife and me a great deal. We were there on a holiday and to get some relaxation, not to be harrassed by some big bouncer-type guy. Then, we had a poor in-suite dining experience. The waiter dropped a glass of water, broke it but assured us that everything was fine. He then left after which my wife and I found a number of glass pieces. The waiter never came back to clean the mess. This hotel does not warrant a 4 star rating, let alone 5. I don't think I'll be booking into Trump International in the future.

Luckily, I have the reservation printed out, he called Hotels.com, and got it sort out. He was very friendly, and upgraded me to a suite with strip view on high floor for my patience.

They blow some kind of fresh scent through the vents! We were greeted with cold water and to get to our room, we had to only walk through the lobby. Our room was on the 59th floor with a fabulous view of the south Strip. The room was lovely and clean with a small, fully equipped kitchen. It did not, however, have a minibar, so if thirsty, we had to go to the store in the lobby. I will add the the location is a bit peculiar, and not super handy for walking around (especially in the summer heat), but we had a car,and the valets were very quick, so it was not an issue for us.

After spending the day trying to squeeze past crowds in the other hotels and inhaling pungent cigar smoke, it was nice to come back to a hotel that smelled like flowers and was always quiet. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They will go out of their way to make your stay more enjoyable. Two things to note that we didn't like. First, the pool closes at 6pm which is absolutely ridiculous. It's 95-100 degrees in Vegas all summer. it would be nice to be able to take a swim in the evening to cool off and unwind. Second, it is very convenient to cut through the mall to get to the strip during the day, but at night, when the mall is closed, it can be a little dangerous trying to navigate your way back down the street with cars whizzing by and no consistent path for safety. I hope they address this and build a walkway to the strip for patrons. As for the room itself, it is heaven! The bed is the most comfortable you will find anywhere and the bathroom is a woman's dream! Double marble sinks, a jacuzzi tub, a huge shower, and a separate area for the toilet.
