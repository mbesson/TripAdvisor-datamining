Although the rate was more than three times what it would normally be, the hotel was not out of line with what other places were charging. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The sales manager Dennis was very helpful and welcoming as well. Although a taxi was 40$ into downtown, the hotel staff always helped with calling a car and securing it. The rooms were average in size but very clean. Beds were super comfortable and the entire hotel was spotless. Complimentary full breakfast in the morning was very well done.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Sailguy", "ReviewID": "UR118911294", "Content": "my wife and I stayed here after taking in the IU football game in Bloomington--we're from Chicago and didn't feel like driving back up that night. Property is definitely newer, right off 465, nice lobby, tons of parking, Fountain at the main entrance was a nice touch too. Staff was very friendly. Room was good sized, flat screen TV, had a king and mattress and comforter/pillows were excellent. Fridge in room too along with microwave. Got to the pool and it was heated. Hot tub was great. Suburban hotel so pool was nice sized as was the adjacent gym--all super clean. Precor equipment in the gym so definitely nice. Didn't try the bar but did do room service.

I was all set to give them 3 or 4 stars right up until I came back from work last night to find that the maid had left my door propped open with the security bar! There was nothing of value in the room and nothing was missing but it easily could have been. Fortunately the room was at the end of the hall so not much foot traffic would have seen it open. I called the desk to complain and they told me they would \"get back to me\" - nobody did so I complained again this morning and was given a free breakfast coupon for my trouble.

One night it took forever to get the food and then the order was wrong, which was annoying but they brought up the right order within about 20 minutes. Breakfast buffet was good and had lots of options though the fruit is set up in such away it is really hard to get the fruit in the back if you are short, which I am. It was a relatively quiet hotel, though I was there during the FFA event and there were a ton of kids I only heard noises every so often.
