{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Clean and cheap but showing age I have stayed at Mastapa several times over the years, most recently July and August of 2007. The service is great and the pool/courtyard is lush and beautiful. The rooms are really showing age and could handle an upgrade. The lighting is dim, mini bar showing rust, furniture and curtains are faded and scuffed. Love the morning breakfast. If you are looking for a cheap option in a great location in Kuta, this is a good spot. You might find better, though.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR716786648", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "papua2001mk"}, {"Content": "Quiet oasis Very clean and friendly family run hotel.
