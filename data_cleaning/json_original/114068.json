We had a beautiful ceremony and the hotel helped in any way they could. We took up quite a few rooms so we got to see the entire range of rooms. Obviously the oceanside loft was fantastic. Beautiful views of the sunset, vaulted ceilings, Sand steps from our door. Even wales viewable from the balcony! The other two rooms i was in were exactly as stated and well worth the room rate. Although one of them did have a pretty bad view (a wall), the hotel staff was notified and the situation was corrected immediately. My point here is if you are unhappy about your accommodations, don't wait till you get home to write a bad review of the hotel. Ask the staff to correct the situation. I find it hard to believe that you will not be satisfied with the service. The grounds were amazing! Well maintained and very open. The beach was small but beautiful and private. We were able to snorkel right there in front of our room which was a bonus for me! So here we are 10 years later and are booking at the Maui Lu again. We cannot wait to go back and i am sure our experience will be fantastic. Of course a review will follow after our trip also. For all the people complaining about this hotel, i want you to understand that this place plays a vital roll for some families. It offers regular families the ability to get good accommodations on one of the most beautiful places on earth. This hotel is not perfect and they do not claim to be. On a budget this is the best deal on Maui in my opinion.

The service is very good, any issues we had (there were a couple, which I will address) were taken care of quickly and without any off-hand remarks. The rooms aren't anything to write home about, but they are more then adequate to handle a week or two vacation. As for the issues we had, we originally booked a single king room, but got put into a double queen room. We called about 5 minutes after we got into the room and realized the mistake, and they told us they were booked for the night and to call back in the morning. We did, and they had us in the correct room by that afternoon. There is a laundry facility on site, which is nice if you have a family or are on a longer trip, but the facility isn't kept up as well as it should be. There are three washing machines and three dryers. One of the washing machines was out of order, and two of the dryers had full change containers, meaning they were inoperable. Also, the Tide and Bounce dispensers were empty and apparently had not been checked in some time. We addressed this with the front desk and they had someone there to get us what we needed, but the appliances couldn't be taken care of on the spot (the facility they were rented from must take care of them personally). The location is good, about 30 minutes from Kahului Airport and 45 minutes (with traffic) from Lahaina. If you are planning on going to the Hana side of the island, it will take a bit of time, but other than that no complaints. Shopping and dinning can be found 5 or so minutes to the south. You can get to the Shops at Wailea (outdoor mall) in about 15 minutes. The rooms are run-of-the-mill and not memorable. They are somewhat dated, but clean and easy to move around in. The closet isn't huge, but should suffice for a few \"must hang\" items. The bathroom is somewhat small, but two people can get ready at the same time with minimal elbow bumping. The only huge issue we ran into was the shower. The regulator was apparently no longer working, and the shower would jump between hot and cold very quickly. Anytime there was a change in water pressure anywhere in the building, the temperature would jump one direction or the other. Nothing could be done, so we had to live with it. If you are planning on staying in South Kihei and you aren't worried about having a 4 or 5 star resort to crash at, the Maui Lu is a good bet.

The gardens were immaculate and very well maintained. As I mentioned this is very close to the beach, from our room it was about a 2 minute walk across the road to the Kihei Beach. The downside was the shops and eating places were about a 20 minute walk which meant each time you had to allow for that or consider a taxi. Once in Kihei though there was plenty of places including fast food, cafes and some restaurants. There is also a supermarket, drug store and plenty of other stores.

The pool is fine, not sure it is heated, though. The pool house/housekeeping area is very worn, keep out unless you need towels. The grounds are pleasant and well kept. Landscaping is nice, plenty of birds flying around, and a few cats. It appears there is a building that was once part of the complex that has been left to rot right next door. Keep your nosy kids out of there, it looks dangerous and should be torn down. The front desk personnel are super friendly and helpful. We had an opportunity to peek into some ocean-front rooms, and they were updated and nice. They had tile floors, and lovely lanais. The tiny beach across the street is cute and swimmable.

It has 2 full size beds, and my fiancee is 6 feet tall and his legs were hanging outside of the bed when lying down. I called the front desk, who were very quick to give us a queen size bed room with an ocean view. I was thankful for that. The 2nd room it felt a little bit cleaner. Though upon a close loo, the couch is very dirty and has turned black, but they covered it with new fabrics, but most of the \"black\" arm areas are still showing. The worst thing is the noise from the air conditioner and the traffic. We stayed at 508, and it is right on the side of the road. Normally I am a deep sleeper, but this time round, I couldn't even fall asleep. I tried to turn off the air-con only to find out that the noise from the traffic is continuous (busy road) even at night. I decided to leave the roaring air-con on so that it covers the traffic noise. Bed is too soft for my liking, and luckily the bedsheets felt clean (or so I told myself). Maybe the first room would have been better noise-wise, but it just wouldn't have worked for me and my fiancee. Front desk did try and give us a \"better\" room w/o the extra ocean view charge. There's a microwave, only it is behind the front desk to be shared by everyone. I have never seen this before, even other motels I went to have microwave in each room. TVs are old, and maybe 13\" big. Picture quality was poor (i.e. snowing effect on tv). I have to say it is my first time in Maui, so I had too much hope for what I was going to get.

The Maui Lu Resort was in the top five of Hotels that I had planned to possibly stay at. My flight landed at around Midnight, so I decided to take a Taxi to the Maui Lu just for a single night and check out the other Hotels the next day. I stayed in the low-buget room No.305 and was pleasantly surprised with the classic style and ambience of this inviting room. The room had vaulted ceilings, very spacious, clean and well maintained, certainly not a 5-star Hotel Room, yet in many ways, 'better' than the high priced Hotels that I always stay away from. The next morning, I had strong intensions of staying at the Maui Lu for the complete 10 days of my trip, yet I decided to also investigate the 'other' Hotels in the Kihei area to compare values. The Maui Lu is definitely the favourite 'best' Hotel for the value, in truth, even if the cost of accommodations were higher at the Maui Lu, I would choose to stay there. The location is quiet, serene and pastorial, the surrounding grounds, landscaping and exquisite Coconut Grove were gorgeous and amazing. I was awoked by the sounds of birds every morning which was a true delight. Another advantage of the Maui Lu is the almost 30 meter Swimming Pool shaped like the Island of Maui. I am a strong, endless swimmer and probably swam several miles in that Pool, it is illuminated at night. Although I was somewhat reluctant about the Maui Lu before my trip to Hawaii, after reading some of the reviews on this site, my stay at this beautiful 'classic-hotel' ranks as one of the best vacations I have ever experienced. I can understand that certain people have specific requirements, yet the 'negative-reviews' are actually banal, misguided, very misleading and inappropriate. The Quality of a Hotel Experience must be guaged on many different levels. The Staff and Management of the Maui Lu are superb & deluxe and deserve special applause. I have never stayed at a Hotel where the housekeepers, groundsman, pool cleaners, almost everyone, appeared to be extraordinarily happy, cheerful and welcoming to all the guests, many were also actually singing, which is usually a reflection of the attitude and performance of the skilled management. The Maui Lu was most certainly a 'classic-secret-suprise', I was thrilled to have the good fortune of staying there. I will be returning in November/ December 2011 to watch the returning of the Humpback Whales. I have also advised dozens of my friends in Vancouver, Canada that if they travel to Maui => stay at the Maui Lu. Two sidenotes: I was tentatively thinking of renting a car, but decided against that option. The MAUI BUS System served my purposes completely, Day Bus Pass is only $2.00, amazing.

I didn't use the pool, but it looked inviting and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are actually quite large for standard hotel rooms. Now, the bad: The mandatory $10/night \"amenity fee.\" If a fee is mandatory, then it should be included in the room rate - otherwise it's pretty much a bait-and-switch. They can advertise their rates as $10/night lower than they actually are, and then charge this mandatory fee. I'm sure plenty of other hotels do this, but that doesn't make it less scummy. I didn't even want the stuff it was supposed to pay for - I don't care about having a PlayStation in my room, I don't want to rent DVDs on vacation, and if I want wifi I can find a cafe. Seriously, if you want to charge $10 more a night, go ahead and list it as $100 instead of $90. Don't advertise as $90 and then charge a \"mandatory fee.\" It makes you look shady and it makes the customer feel manipulated. The bathroom was not nice. The floor was cracked and yellowing, and the sink counter had big nicks in it. The mattresses felt old; I could feel the springs. I could have forgiven all of that if not for the inescapable white noise. Even if I turned the one in my room completely off, I could still hear the ones next door, and they were VERY loud.

The people that worked there were nice enough. I kind of felt sorry for them for working in such a dump. I stayed in one of the back buildings, not the ocean side ones. Honestly I booked it because it was the cheapest I could find and wanted to save my work money. However, there was a mandatory amenity fee which was reasonable for what you got, especially since they don't charge for parking, but it shouldn't be mandatory. I could have lived without it. If those charges had been in the initial price I would have stayed elsewhere. So if you expect the cheapest, expect what comes with the cheapest. For me it included a pillow that reeked of urine, a shower that had what looked like years of soap scum, an A/C that necessitated using ear plugs to sleep, and what was likely the worst bed I ever slept on. Also, our room was supposed to be a single queen bed but instead had 2 beds which wasn't so romantic--on the plus side it actually allowed one of us to sort of sleep. It's nice to see the manager responds to reviews and I feel bad for her. I'm sure she is in a tough position trying to manage what is basically a dump.

Unfortunately, we were also woken up every morning by other guests talking outside our room at 5am. I don't know why people don't realize that other people might be sleeping at that hour! Also regarding noise, the resort has a luau three times a week, which can be noisy. The only other thing I worth mentioning is that there's only one pool and they had to unexpectedly close it for repairs. They suggested using the community pool in Kihei but we didn't want to do that so they offered to move us to the Aston Banyon, also in Kihei. The Banyon isn't oceanfront so we were upgraded to a suite with a partial ocean view to compensate us for losing the oceanfront room.

We usually go to Kauai so Maui was new to us. We are very experienced travelers having been all over the world and to Hawaii 10 times in the last six years. My review is not to bash this business but to educate potential patrons. First, we arrived to a very friendly staff that checked us in quickly. We were concerned when we pulled up and noticed a condemed building right next to the main building of the Maui Lu. I thought they must be renovating and there is no way thier buildings are in bad shape, WRONG! Enter the elevator for a suprise, as a Professional Fire Captain I would not ride in that thing if there was a flood on my heals. The railing was unstable on our walk to the room, then we entered our room. WOW, this was not anything like what the website shows, torn up base boards, stains on the walls, sewer smell, stained carpet, old furniture (not old like 10 years old but old). There was no way I was going to stay there for four nights. I went to the desk and tried for a refund but no luck, since I paid about $400 and cashed in roughly 15000 World Points (about $150) for the room they could not help due to a third party issue. Did I believe they could not refund my money, NO. They did offer us an upgrade to an ocean view room which was in SLIGHTLY better condition across the street fo an additional $80, I went back and asked if they could move me to one of the other Aston Hotels on the island and that I would gladly pay any differance in rate, at that point the lady said \"Here, I am giving you our best room for no charge\". After just being tired of spending 2 hours trying to fiqure out our situation I agreed. This women was very helpful, If I remembered her name I would have recomended her for a customer service award as her hands were clearly tied by Aston Hotels. The new room 402 was better and with alittle TLC could be really nice. Its right on the water, needs a security fence to keep the pot dealers from hassling you while relaxing.

They have a microwave and toaster located in the lobby for your use as well as BBQ's. The hotel also offers beach towels at the front desk and boggie boards. Check in was a breeze as was check out. We didn't go to the beach accross from the resort, but it looked very nice. They also have someone beside the front desk that assists with booking tours. Some other reviews commented on the old building on the grounds. I honestly didn't notice it until the 6th day and we drove past every day twice a day! LOL Great stay for a great price. We were only in Maui for 8 days and we decided to eat out most of the time. We brought bowls and spoons from home and had cereal and toast for breakfast it worked out great. Loved having the fridge to keep our snacks, fruit and beverages cold. The beds were great , I thought they may be way to hard...but I had the best sleep of my life better then home.

It is cheaper to stay here than other places because it is an old property. This is a fact, no sense staying here and then complaining afterwards about how old it is. I was fully aware of that fact when booking here. I do have to agree with other reviewers that when driving up to the check-in area the old, unused, falling apart building that is front and center provides a very poor first impression of the resort. I stayed here for my first night in Maui. Chose this hotel for proximity to the airport and price. I wanted to stay 1 night here as I could get here quickly after a very tiring day of travelling. I also wanted to save some money on my first night as I knew I would be tired and not want to spend hours shopping and stocking up for my condo. This was the perfect place to do this. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. Check in was painless and pleasant. I stayed in an oceanside room across the road from the check-in area and main gardenview buildings and pool. The Oceanside parking lot is very small, but there is lots of extra parking just across the road if the lot is full or you are driving a larger vehicle. My Oceanside room had been recently upgraded with new bedding, drapes etc. The bed was very comfortable, the room was nice and cool and there was a mini fridge and stocked coffee maker. I was in a ground floor room with a nice patio area with 2 chairs and a table. The patio doors do come off track, they are old, but it locks well so felt perfectly safe and comfortable. The hotel does not offer free internet. You must purchase a package or use the pay per use computers at the check-in area. Our room also did not have a safe. The grounds at this property are huge and beautiful. They have a very serene feel and get you in the Aloha Spirit very quickly. The pool is very nice with lots of loungers and tables and chairs to relax around. It is a bit hard getting in and out as the sides of the pool are sloped. This is not a problem if you use the stairs and railing. The Luau was going on the night we were there and it looked very intimate. It is a small family style Luau and looked like it would be good for a family with young children. Not huge and commercialized as at some of the larger resorts. The beach coves are very tiny and not suitable for swimming/sunning, but are very nice to get your toes in the sand and water. The location of this hotel is not really walkable to restaurants/shopping. You will certainly need a car if staying here. All in all I was very satisfied with this hotel and it met my expectations perfectly. I would not have been satisfied spending my whole Maui vacation here, but to get my bearings and get a good night's sleep I would not hesitate to stay here again for a first or last night stay in Maui due to location, close to the airport, exceptional grounds and low cost.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms with mini fridge.\u201d", "Author": "BluesTraveller292", "ReviewID": "UR96260552", "Content": "Loved our stay at the Maui Lu.

We were here for a two night stay and enjoyed the beautiful views of our oceanfront room! If you are fussy about the \"glitz\" factor of hotels, this is not for you, however. The sliding glass door to the lanai goes off track, and the air conditioner is a little loud, but we did not fret about things like that. The views off our lanai were amazing! The grounds were beautiful! Our walks on the beach were wonderful! The location is not the greatest, but we are walkers so we actually walked north to the marina which is probably a little over three miles, and south to the commercial area of Kihue by the post office which is probably a mile. The walk on the beach, north, is a nice walk, however, the walk, south, is along the road and can be unsafe at times. This is due to lack of sidewalks most of the way which requires you to walk on the shoulder. We were in Maui for tranquility and relaxation, and this place fit the bill. We walked to the ABC Drugstore everyday, and had a bite to eat at a short order place next door. There also is a small farmers market there. Also, there are two canoe clubs which you can walk to and sign up to paddle on certain days. You can see whales breeching off the beach. Amazing! We also walked to the Isana Restaurant close by and had a delicious Korean meal. All in all, it was a great stay despite the isolated location. We are walkers so we did not rent a car. We took the Speedi Shuttle from the airport for fifteen dollars apiece. However, for most people who want to take in all the sights, a car would be a necessity. They do have a city bus with limited service, however. That could be another option. A room could be had for a cheaper price across the street, eighty-eight dollars at the time we went, but for a short stay we opted for the ocean front for 150.00, senior discount. Being budget conscious, if we were there longer, we probably would have stayed across the street. However for two days, the splurge on the oceanfront was well worth it. The room did not have a microwave, but it did have a refrigerator and coffeemaker.

The room is very spacious with the size of 1 bedroom + 1 living room. We had the garden view room at a cheaper rate but the greenery view was pleasant enough to compete with the ocean view. The only downside we can think of is that there's no free internet. What's the most impressive is there are a few lovely cats living in the hotel area. If you're a cat lover you'll immediately like this place. Among all those cats, Samuel, a very cute grey tabby tomcat who appears to be the king cat in the neighborhood, made our stay absolutely unforgettable. Samuel seems to be a former house cat who got abandoned and he seems to be striving for love from people. After our first meet Samuel came to our room every morning before we left and every evening after we came back, for an hour or so. To show that he did not come for food, he usually would not eat the little snack we gave him at first, but would kindly finish it before he left. He's always very loving, gentle and polite, never hopped on the couch without invitation. Most of the time he would simply lying on the floor, taking a peaceful indoor nap. There's one evening we got some take-out food and offered the leftover to Samuel. At the end of his stay, I walked him down the stairs and saw him run into the dark to chase after something. After a few minutes when I was about to have a shower, I heard Samuel meowing outside our room. My boyfriend opened the door, took a peek outside and quickly closed the door. He told me Samuel was waiting there with a mouse in his mouth. Obviously Samuel was thanking us in his own way. Due to hygienic reason we didn't let Samuel in, he waited for a while and left. We felt bad to turn down Samuel's friendly gesture which we highly appreciated. The next day we went to the store to pick up a few cans of cat food and a flea collar for Samuel. On the day we left Maui, Samuel kept us company until we checked out. He walked us down the stairs and saw us off. This unexpected friendship with a Hawaiian cat has become the highlight of our trip. We keep missing Samuel after we came back to Canada and I do have a plan to go back to Maui and to this hotel again sometime in the future just to see Samuel. So, if you're a cat person, stay in this hotel and meet the legendary Samuel! He has a white belly and hopefully still wears a beige (used to be white) collar.

If you are a budget minded traveler who doesn't mind worn (but safe) facilities, this is a good place. Private beach, free parking, good price, friendly staff if you don't mind the worn furnishings and some level of grottiness. I only had one night in Maui and wanted to do as cheaply as possible. This room was the result of a priceline bid of $63. For that price (less than apartment stays), I was willing to put up with some wear and tear. When I checked in, I was offered an upgrade to oceanfront for an additional $20 and I probably should have taken it. The resort consists of three areas. Two oceanside buildings which flank a private beach with its own parking lot with the main resort across the street (open air lobby/reception/concierge and pool and then the main resort behind the lobby). From the main resort, it's 5 min. walk across the grounds and street to get to the beach. Like the rooms, the grounds are minimally maintained. Grass and landscaping are cut/trimmed, but not terribly inviting or pleasant, The main buildings face each other across a large expanse of grass, so one can pretty much see the entire resort when you walk out of your room...not terribly private. As others have said, the rooms are dated and worn, but I personally didn't see evidence of mold, grot, etc. My room was quite large with two beds (neither of which were comfortable...I think it's been awhile since the mattresses were replaced. The location is very convenient. 15 minutes to the airport, 3-minute drive or about 10-15 minute walk to downtown Kihei, close to a new mall (with a Hilo Hatties if you're looking for souvenirs and otherwise pretty central.

There are about three old lounge chairs strewn about. So if they're not taken, you can relax on the beach, which is quiet as long as the waves drown out traffic from the nearby road. - The room has a fridge and coffee maker. - The hotel hosts a luau throughout the week. It is smaller and less fancy (and albeit less expensive) than other luaus in Maui. But it is convenient to just walk across the street rather than driving to Lahaina or another hotel. During the luau you can make your own lei and there are other kid-friendly activities. The food leaves a lot to be desired, but the entertainers are fun and you can tell a lot of them are related. It's truly a family affair. The bad - The room is out of date and not really worth the price (definitely not a resort). - I was shocked to find ants living it up in and around the sink in my bathroom. - The room didn't really scream cleanliness and relaxation.

My wife spent $100 and bought two outfits. If we did not stay at the Maui Lu, we would not have the experience of the flea market, and outlet stores and other things as well.

Sure you can stay at one of those expensive resort and lay around the beach, but you would not experience the culture, the store and the events.

Property was nearly sold to Marriot for condo development in 2007, but deal fell through at last moment. There is a main building thats now used by a church \"Calvary Church\", a sunday school, a hula school. There are two entire wings that have been abandoned to nature, the railings are collapsing and are uninhabitable. There are 7+ villa-bungalow things that also are mostly collapsed on themselves and uninhabitable. Then there is a wing by the pool thats in good shape. There are also \"ocean view\" buildings that are recently renewed. They are in better shape but there's quite a bit of road noise, and the view's not that important for us. The main property is so great and special, we prefer it to the beach. We had a ground floor room 173. 2 Queen beds, fridge, lanai that looked out on the back yard (acres of grass and tennis courts, then a fence and residential neighborhood beyond). Kids loved the green grass to play catch and run in the sprinklers. The big pool is in the shape of Maui. The night we arrived there was a Luau, tons of guests in full Hawaiian regalia, guys with matching hawaian print shirts, shorts AND shoes. Fire dance, hula girls, cheesy luau MC \"any anniversaries this evening...\" Couples hula, kids hula, guys from audience hula with the hula girls, fun for all. Kids STUNNED and amazed and enchanted. Old school hawaii tourist. Fun for all as we watched from the pool area (along with the hotel staff). Price was very reasonable, <$90/night. The lobby is pretty neat, there is wifi there. Free coffee too. There is a beach across the street by the Ocean Front rooms, but its small and not that exciting.

We spent 2 weeks in one of the Ocean Front rooms and could not have been happier. Every morning we went and ate our Costco muffins on what felt like our own private beach. The views were wonderful. We watched whales from the beach and from our lanai. We watched tiny crabs one morning on the beach and one day my husband even saw some fishermen bring in a stingray caught in a net and free it at the beach. The room was clean as clean could be - no bugs ever and we stayed 14 nights and had food everyday in the room. The fridge was much bigger than we expected and we kept a gallon of milk, a large carton of juice, several sodas, yogurts and 3-4 leftover cartons in it all the time. We would re-heat with the microwave in the lobby and the staff could always get us forks or knives as we needed them. It was an older room but we were in Maui - never in the room, I think we turned the tv on once in 2 weeks. Staying here let us extend our stay in Maui from 10 days to 14 days for the same price. We wouldn't give up those extra four days to stay at the 4 Seasons. The pool which we had read so many bad comments about is AMAZING. My kids are both competition swimmers and this pool is over 25 yards long. It is not a lap pool as it is shaped like the island of Maui, and it is not for young kids as it gets very deep. It was clean and clear and wonderful. Another very cool feature of this hotel was that they had a big \"sharing\" box by the front desk. You could leave things like boogie boards or coolers or extra suntan lotion when your trip was over. And use things others had left while you were there. We never bought the bamboo mats for the beach as there were always 3-4 in the box. We were too busy to do many of the craft projects offered, but the one we did was fun and low key and very Aloha.

My sister and her husband also had a room. We loved the Maui Lu. From the beautiful sprawling grounds, to the recently renovated pool, to our rooms which were large and comfortable. Our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ocean Front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room was large with new paint and carpet. We had a great view of the daily Humpback Whale show out in the bay. The room contained a small fridge and coffee maker along with all of the typical amenities. Two double beds, Table and chairs. There were chaise lounges and chairs for sitting outside. My sister somehow lucked out and got a suite which is twice the size of a regular room. Her two room suite had a small kitchen/dining area with a microwave, two TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a couch, two lanais. She paid the same price as we did- $113.00/nt The grounds are beautiful and the pool is fantastic. The area around the pool is very nice with plenty of chaises and chairs. The pool is very large and I had it to myself every morning for my daily swim. By my measurements it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about about 58 lengths at the longest point for a mile. I would finish my swim about dawn \u00e2\u20ac\u201cwhat a wonderful way to start the day on those beautiful grounds. The beach area just out from our rooms was small, but doable. It is a beautiful area with kite surfers and wind surfers are in abundance. They provide propane BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s if you feel like running over to Safeway and grabbing some surf and turf \u00e2\u20ac\u201cwhich we did a couple of times. To conclude, our stay at the Maui Lu was fantastic. The front desk, housekeeping and grounds personnel were all very helpful and nice. The room was great, bedding was nice, everything worked properly, my sister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room upstairs was even better. From some other reviews posted apparently rooms on the mountain side of the road have not been or are the process of being updated. Our room had fresh paint and carpet.

I do recommend the Maui Lu, but you need to understand that the property is a bit run down, rough and grungy around the edges, however, the staff are very nice, kind and helpful. Aston recently took over the property from ResortQuest Hawai'i and is in the process of upgrading the facilities...but slowly. Most of the property, including the pool, checkin, tour desk and rooms are on one side of the road through Kihei, and the beach, along with 3 beachfront buildings are on the other side of the road. We stayed in an oceanfront room right next to the sea, if we had been any closer to the ocean we would've been wet. Our room was spacious and clean, although in need of some rehab; the bed was comfortable and housekeeping stopped by most days. The view from our lana'i was splendid, a public beach with views of Kaho\u00ca\u00bbolawe and Molokini on one side, the West Maui Mountains and Lana'i on the other, and the vast expanse of the ocean spread out in front of you. For the money you could not beat our location and views. On 2 different days we saw a number of Humpback whales breaching off in the distance just off the coast from Lahaina Town. Awesome!

We had booked an ocean front room, and they gave us indeed a two level room, with a magnificent view. But other than that, the room as well as the rest of the hotel was falling apart. Where to start from? Room: at the lower level (sitting area and bathroom) the sofa had breadcrumbs on it and was so filthy, that we had to ask for a bedsheet to cover it, in order to be able to sit on it. There was a mini fridge and coffee/tea making facilities, but there were ants crawling everywhere. Again we called the maid and asked her to spray for the ants. The bathroom was just basic, the shower curtain old, the filter of the hairdryer covered with mold and again, ants were everywhere on the cheap formaica around the sink. The upper level (sleeping area) was good but ants (far less than in the lower level) were there too. The two a/c units were loud and their outer parts so filthy that you think twice before using them. Paint is peeling everywhere, wall papers and carpets look dirty... what a shame!! We complained about the ants the next morning and the hotel manager came to reassure us that they would take care of it. We returned in the afternoon, only to find the ants in our room alive and kicking! Plus the people who where supposed to clean the room had unplugged the fridge by mistake, and next morning the carpert in front of the fridge was soaking; that's how we found out. Overall, the view was great, and the bedsheets were soft, but that's all there is to it. Service: the hotel offers no breakfast, not even with an extra cost. There is free coffee, hot water, a toaster and a microwave available for use. So make sure you bring everything you need for your breakfast -plates, forks, mugs and something to eat. All there is around the coffee machine is a bowl with sugar / creamer (thank God in individual portions, because the bowls are filthy as well). There is an activities desk by the reception; we booked our whale watching trip there. Grounds: the grounds are well kept, and the sitting area in front of the reception is inviting. But right behind it, there is an abandoned building with broken windows -probably it used to be part of the hotel- and you don't even want to think how dirty this must be. Location: you definitely need a car as the hotel is located at the very beginning of Kihei, away from any restaurant, super market etc. Plus there are signs around the hotel, warning you that \"you enter the sea at your own risk\", therefore the beach ther might not that inviting (we did not try it).

Yes, you can get a good deal on price but you get much less than what you're expecting. My husband and I got the cheapest available room, and it was the worst place I have ever stayed in. Room 103, bottom floor. I have stayed in hostels in Europe in my early 20's that were cleaner than the Maui Lu. The foul, moldy odor is clear as soon as you approach the door to the room and will come home with you on your luggage and all of your belongings. Have a bottle of Febreeze handy as soon as you get home. The AC unit barely affected just the corner it was in, and the wooden housing holding it outside the window was completely covered in mold (look at the ones on higher levels and it's not as bad). The only bug bites I got in Maui were from the room. I wouldn't walk around barefoot on that carpet either. The blankets were the worst! All bedspreads are typically not comfy, but the \"blanket\" was like sleeping with a brillo pad (wire mesh sponge). And the bathroom was bad. From the slanted formica counter top, to the power outlet at the top of the mirror that didn't work, the most horrible part of the bathroom was that the shower had one of those \"bed sheet on a curtain rod\" things where you're showering and desperately trying to avoid the wet curtain touching your body. We left our room early in the morning each day, and got back late each night but the little time we did spend in the room was disgusting. And who can forget the lovely abandoned hotel building on one end of the property, with some boarded windows and some broken, and big holes in the wall where you can see tables and chairs in the room, and the marks where the staircase used to be. I believe even a homeless person wouldn't want to squat in one of those units. And the location is not great if you plan on hanging out in Kihei. Yes, there's a small private beach right across the street but most guidebooks don't suggest swimming anywhere there until you get to Kamaole Beach I because of the cleanliness of the water and the seaweed issues. All of what you want to be close to in Kihei is not near the Maui Lu. You'll have to drive atleast 2 miles down Kihei Road to get to anything worthwhile (except Oceans and Homemaid Cafe are closer than 2 miles). If you are looking for a great deal on price, and the Maui Lu is what you're finding, look for the next cheapest deal. The Maui Lu is not worth the little you may pay for the room.

We kept the balcony door open to get a breeze, but to really get air into the room we needed to open the front door, which we saw other people doing, as well. The walls are very thin - we could easily hear our next door neighbors (and some kind of band practice that took place in the main hotel building one morning at 7AM!?!). So, overall, this is not the kind of room that you want to spend any time in other than for sleeping. If the priority is saving money and being centrally located, this is a good place, but otherwise, I would not recommend it.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cBreath taking ocean view...\u201d", "Author": "emailgreg", "ReviewID": "UR46852658", "Content": "The resort is large, older yes but worth every penny.

We did have a problem with the room, it seems that a group of ladies booked the entire bottom floor and the hotel told us that we have the bottom floor for 3 days then we have to move upstairs! We did not want upstairs and we did not want to move. They wanted us to move on Sunday, we were married on Saturday. So we choose another room on the bottom floor in the other unit. Now that room was not very nice, it had a damp feel to it. So I called the desk again and YES there was a room in the original unit and we could move in the morning. The staff was great, they really went out of their way to make us happy, considering they gave our room away! The grounds are beautiful, the beach area is pretty. I miss my tree! The one cove has a bent palm tree that I sat on drinking my coffee in the morning while watching the water and enjoying the view. Now there is a 2 cup coffee maker and small fridge in the rooms along with ironing board, iron and blow dryer.

We saved some $ going with this resort and were kind of worried with some of the mixed reviews we read here but are so glad we stayed here now. After reading reviews here we were allready aware that this is not a \"resort style\" property. We opted to upgrade to their ocean front rooms for the addtitional $25 a night and were so pleased! There are no resturants or bars on the property but there is a small fridge in the room for drinks and small smacks, which worked out perfect for us. We made our own drinks at the hotel room while we enjoying the beach and a refill was less than 20yds away! The ocean front rooms are acroos the beach road from the main resort but we never even went to the main resort so we were cool with this. Everything you need is at the building, Ice, beach, nice patio. I highly recomend the ocean front rooms and ask for a lower unit so you can walk to and from beach and yard area freely. The grounds were clean, as is most of Hawaii, and the staff made check in and check out fast and easy. The room was as described in here not a 5 star hotel. More like a motel 6 or holiday inn quality but was roomy and the AC worked great, and the linens and restroom was very clean. We could not hear the traffic of the street as some here reported, it was nill and barely could hear it over the sounds of the crashing waves right outside the door! When I say you are on the beach with these rooms they are on the beach, less than 10 yds from the patio door is the ocean! We stayed in room 404. The hotel is located a little north of the busiest part of Kihei but we liked this also. Really quite and great beaches with hardly anyone ever on them. The hotel gives you that kind of condo feel seeing how you never have to get in an elevator, never have to worry about parking, and the patio leads straight out to the beach. The ocean front rooms have their own private parking lot so parking was easy and we were really close to the room. We highly recomend this hotel and have allready booked a return visit in August, we requested the same room and everything. I have allready recomended this to family and friends and feel we have found a great reasonable priced home in Hawaii from now on. Like I said if your looking for the \"resort Style\" vacation expierence, stay away from the Maui Lu as it's more of a laid back do it on your own style of resort.

After seeing the reviews on Trip Advisor I was more than a little concerned about this place. Now that I have been here for several days I feel it is only fair to offer some feedback. After a very long day of travel, arranging for a rental car at Kahalui, and driving at night to the Maui Lu, I was first surprised by the beautiful grounds - large property with hundreds of palm trees, flowering bouganvillia and plumeria everywhere, and a friendly staff. I was exhausted so the porter who drove his cart to my car, loaded and delivered me and my bags to my 3rd floor room was much appreciated. The room was larger than I expected, but not a luxurious accomodation. I slept well, as it is very quiet here. In the morning I found that the view from my room looked out over a gorgeous setting of palms and lawn to the waves crashing against the shore, with a volcano in the background. A stunningly beautiful pool was surrounded by more palms and manicured lawn. Is this place dated? OH YEAH. Is it shabby? A bit. But I can't say it is dirty, just old. The towels are dormitory quality thin THIN white towels, there is a gap between the window air conditioner unit and the wall that I can almost place my hand through, it looks as though it was last decorated in 1980, and the hot water takes a while (*think summer camp in Tahiti), BUT GOOD GRIEF....YOU ARE IN MAUI! So get over it and realize this is a BEACH resort and EVERYTHING is casual. You are right across the street from the beach, and if you don't like the beach, then the pool is really nice - spectacular actually. This is NOT the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton, but I have been very comfortable here. Today for lunch I stopped at the Farmer's Market down the street and have been enjoying fresh pineapple, bananas and macadamia nuts all afternoon while watching paradise outside my window. The location is great if you have a car - 5 minutes to the center of Kihei, 10 minutes to Ma'alea, 15 minutes to Kahalui, and 20 minutes to the airport. They advertise wi-fi in the lobby, but I am able to get it in my room (maybe since I am close to the lobby). There is also a refrigerator and coffee maker in the room, so you can pick up some provisions if need be. POSITIVE POINTS: Location Pool Easy parking and elevator Probably the cost (I am not paying so I don't really know) Proximity to beach Beautiful grounds Quiet The view (at least from my room - 301) Friendly staff NEGATIVE POINTS: Dated A bit shabby You MUST have a car No room service or restaurant on premises Not luxurious The adjacent building is abandonded and falling apart - a bit unpleasant to walk or drive past....maybe they will renovate it soon? Would I stay here again? Absolutely! Would I recommend this to friends? Yes - with the comments I have made above. If you must have luxury and all the ammenities, this is not the place for you.

We had two rooms, both had clogged toilets, dilapidated furniture, and just an over-all run down feel.

It went down hill from there. The room I stayed in was across the street. The parking lot hosts the smallest car spaces I have ever been in and it was full.

The bathroom gave me the willies, I dared not step barefoot on the floor. There was a small A/C unit that I promptly set to cool, but the room never quite got comfortably cool... Probably because my front door did not adequately shut. The Maui Lu still uses the old fashioned KEYS for your room and the deadbolt barely fit into the door jam. There were traces of an old bar slide lock but the area where the lock would fit into has been long wittled away leaving about a 1\" gap between the door and the door jam. I am guessing this contributed to the mass of tiny mosquito like bugs flying around. The beds were not comfortable at all. There was a wall print that was dated \"1989\"...I'm guessing nothing has been done to the property since then. The upstairs balcony had bubbled paint that exposed rotting wood and it was starting to fall. Read: the balcony was not 90 degrees straight, it tilted slightly to the outside. There was a small mini fridge - next to the old broken mini fridge in the room. The outdated rattan furniture had stains and grossness on the sides.

Over the course of the few months between booking and our stay, I had been reading the reviews of the Maui Lu on various sites. I had convinced myself that the negative reviews were for the cheaper, \"garden view\" rooms and since we had booked a \"deluxe ocean view\" room, that we'd be o.k. I decided that I would thoroughly take pictures and notes so that I could come back & advise others like me, with no actual experience but a desire for true advice on the place. Here it goes: the positives: our room #515 was a huge loft, only paces from the beach. Every window offered an absolutely unparalleled view of the ocean, beach and opposite part of the island in the distance. In fact, every night the booming of the waves lulls you to sleep and the view from one's bed in the morning wakes you with a smile. The ocean view/front rooms have the best location that anyone could ever wish for when staying on the island. The small beach in front of these buildings is truly small, but if you walk around to the other side of the building (approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute of a walk) you have a large, generally vacant beach all to yourself. This is where the positives end. (LOCATION, VIEW & ROOM SIZE of the deluxe ocean view room). As I said before, I truly wanted to love this place. I tried to love this place, but it was filthy. Previous reviews remark on the attentiveness of the housekeeping staff. I wish I could as well. In our 6 day stay, the sheets were never changed. I put a small X on a corner of the sheets & came back each day to find the bed neatly made, but with the same sheets. Also on 3 occasions dirty hotel glasses, which I had emptied of their contents & set out for the staff to take away, were left where they were, dirty. The loft portion of the room was never vaccumed, as small dead bugs and other crumbs were apparent from check in to check out, however the bottom portion was vaccuumed daily. The couch was like something you'd find in a dump. I have dust allergies & it became immediately apparent upon sitting on the soiled and grimey thing that it was laden with dust (among who knows what else). The entire stay, I had to lay a towel over it to keep myself from erupting into fits of sneezing and watering eyes & a runny nose. There is a gecko that lives in the room as well, but he was very entertaining as he'd come out of the cracks in the walls each night & watch out over us as we watched t.v. in bed. Also, the air conditioning was filled with dust and therefore we often had to due without it. The last day of our stay, we both came down with colds and although I'd like to not blame it on our room, it is possible that the filth of it all contributed at least in part. When we first got there, I likened the room to a cabin. A little old and dirty, but not half as bad as people were saying. Upon a day into the stay, I began to see what all the fuss was about. So, in the end, if you like camping but like to sleep in a comfortable bed instead of on the hard ground, this place would work quite nicely. I mean this in all sincerity. It is filthy, but the bed is comfortable and the view is extra-ordinary. If you are like me and don't require much but clean surroundings, think twice about it. We got one of the \"nicest\" rooms in the place and what I've told you is the honest truth from someone with minimal expectations. There are a number of places to stay in Kehei & many of them are not costly. I would recommend checking them out, as Kehei is the best town in Maui to stay in my opinion.

We didn't spend much time at the hotel, our focus was being on the beach or some other activity (e.g. snorkling). We came to Maui to have fun on Maui, not hang out in our hotel room. We did not have any children with us, and for us room service is not important (there is none at the Maui Lu). We are the kind of folks who don't mind staying at a \"Super 8\" or \"Motel 6\" to save money (which we then spend on other activities).

There was mold around the edges of the sink and the shower. There were holes in the wall where it looked like a towel bar was or a handicapped railing was. The closet door was off its hinge when we got there and house keeping did not put it back on during our week long stay. There is a small fridge in the room which was nice to have. There is only a fridge, so don't go thinking that there is a stove and microwave like some of the condo resorts have. Airconditioning worked fine. I did see a cockroach but it was outside and I never saw any bugs in the room (we were on the 3rd floor so that may have made a difference) Water: The front desk tells you that they have their own private beach cove which is true but trust me this is not an ideal swimming area. Apparently most of the rain runoff comes out in this area so the water is not as nice as the waters/beaches to the south. Save your money and get a gardenview...you are going to be at the beach everyday anyway. Activities: We did the Maui Dive shop Molokini and Turtle snorkel ($50/pp for 3 hours). This is the no frills trip but I loved it. Really, how much time can you spend looking at the same fish...save your self some money and do a shorter trip with fewer people (only about 12 on our trip out) and you must do the morning trip. Saw and swwam with several turtles which was amazing. Do the road to Hana too! Food: Best place is in Ka'anapali - Leilanis (right on the beach and the best location for a sunset dinner on the island). It is a casual place and you don't have to wait long for a table, even at sunset. The food is cheap compared to the other places nearby and the fish tacos are great...try the hula pie as well and you won't be disappointed. Best Advice!!!!!!: Pick up the book \"Maui Revealed\" at one of the souvenir shops. This is the best book especially if you have not been to Maui before. The book has great insider tips on places to go and very candid/honest reviews of attractions and restaurants.

The Maui Lu is in a great location in Kihei, there was a little cove of a beach directly across the street for Maui Lu guests with beach chairs, and a shower, that was nice, and there were miles of beach front to expore across the street on kihei road, around the corner was a great little sushi type resturant, and just down the street heading back into the heart of Kihei only about 3-5 mins away, were grocery stores and plenty of places to eat and shop. It's best to have a car if you stay here, or anywhere on maui for that matter! We would stay at the Maui lu again in a heart beat.

The pieces of motel art on the walls were so faded you couldn't tell what colors they once were. The top of the dormitory-size refrigerator was sticky and stained. Tears and burns in the blankets. The room smelled like public bathroom disinfectant. The hanging light over the table flickered, and when I touched the cord, a flash came out of the plug and the bulb burned out.

Beds were very uncomfortable--you could feel the springs (we paid for a King and got two doubles). Sheets had stains. Small, old, brown refridgerator in room was dirty and barely worked. Coffee maker was not even cleaned. The bathroom was just frightening -- stains and rust everywhere, tub was definitely not clean, toilet looked like it was about to fall apart. 2.

Anyone walking by our patio could see right into the room because the curtains did not completely close. 3. We had an oceanfront room but there was no beach to walk on and this was not a swimming area. 4. Very rude front desk service. There was one lady there (Hawaiian with very long hair) with a lackadaisical and condescending attitude. When checking out, we were not nasty or rude to her at all. We politely explained what we found in the room and that we didn't feel safe staying there. She didn't offer any apologies, didn't offer to change our room, and didn't even offer to not charge us the cancellation fee. When my husband asked that we not be charged this fee because of the room conditions, she gave him a nasty look and said \"This is our policy\". Well, okay, but how about offering us a different room??? What confuses me the most about this hotel is that according to some of the reviews, some people had a wonderful experience and a very nice room (even oceanfront) while most experienced substandard service and conditions. Our experience was so unpleasant that we do not have a desire to visit Maui again.

I hope that whatever is replacing the Maui Lu has it's old traditions and Hawaiian Flavor of the original. I don't know if we can get back to the Maui Lu before it's gone. Is there someway we can definitely find out what's going to become of the Maui Lu and it's properties?

Hairdryers and pool towels were available at the front desk, as was coffee and tea in the am. The gardens were lovely - lots of palms of course and flowering shrubs, birds and the resident cats. The in room fridge was big enough to hold lunch and breakfast materials and lots of water etc. The morning paper delivered to our room was a nice touch, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The road between the beach access was not as busy as we had expected from previous reviews and we found crossing it uneventful - the drivers are courteous if you make your intentions known. We did experience smoke drifting in to our room from neighbours who smoked, but it was only a mild annoyance and we closed the door, briefly. I don't see how this would be any different at any property at any price. Of note is the fact that all beaches in Hawaii are public access, no matter how swanky the hotel fronting it. So go ahead and save your money on the lux accommodations and enjoy the beaches in front of other people's condos! We felt the value was great and spent very little time in the room anyway.

You are right on the road & if you are from a big city with traffic noise you'll love it. Being country mice, we could not sleep the first night at all. Traffic noise NEVER eased up. Not even between 1am & 4am. We did what everyone told us not to do & begged for nice quiet rooms on the other side of the road on the main grounds of the third floor. We thought this was a much BETTER room! Absolutely zero traffic noise. Peaceful, quiet & a view of Haleakala. Only had a couple of pet peeves. While we were on the 3rd floor & in non-smoking rooms the floors below us were smoking rooms. At various times the puffers would light up their cancer sticks & their annoying stench would waft up to our belcony forcing us inside our room. Another thing not advertised by the chambers of commerce on the islands is that there are numerous norway rats. These are wide spread thoughout many lodging facilities on all the islands. Most keep them under some kind of control. At the Maui Lu they were living in the palm trees off our balcony. Told the desk about it & they cut some of the palm fronds so the rats could not go from the trees to the room balconies but they did not kill the rats. We saw them every morning & evening for 9 days. (Actually the town of Kihei had a bubonic plague epidemic from rats in the 1800s. Most of the people living in town were Chinese field workers. Other island folk burnt the whole town down with the workers still in it!) The Maui Lu facility is suffering from both termite & dry rot damage. (Also saw 1 dying cockroach under a chair in the room). They recently sold to a company that will raze the entire resort & construct time shares as soon as they get the necessary permits.

We spent the week before down at the Grand Wailea. For those that have ever stayed at the GW would know, leaving it is never a happy time. OMG, that place is amazing (and crazy expensive, of course). When we got to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLu, I was prepared for the worst, but being budget travelers by nature we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect much. First off, we stayed in the 500 building with the closest room to the ocean. Most of their rooms are located back by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153main office\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is 100 yards or so back from a very busy road. I would not recommend staying anywhere back there unless you want a long walk to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and playing a fun game of haole Frogger trying to cross that road. The ocean-front room we stayed at had seen better days, as most of the reviews here will also mention. Nice size living room area with an older mini fridge and a vaulted upper bed room, which really makes the room seem more like a condo. Nice little lanai with a fantastic view. This end unit room (#514, if I remember right), is literally less than 15 yards to the sea. The view alone made up for any other negatives that the Maui Lu had. The bathroom is small, but it did the job. The TV was also older (everything is older, really) but has basic cable. Overall I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend this place for anyone on a budget who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting the Hilton. Just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in any of those back buildings, unless you only want to hang out at the pool. We passed on that, WAY too much other things to see.

Go horseback riding. Go snorkeling at Molokini Crater, Black Rock, Honolua Bay and Aquarium. Wake up at 4am and go catch the sunrise on Haleakala, then ride bikes back down from the summit. Pack up a cooler and hit the Hana highway, and take the detour down to the Blue Pool, words could not do it justice, you must see it. Spend all day trying to get a parking spot on Front Street in Lahaina. Hey, even this was fun, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maui!. Or just kick back and relax at Big Beach. If money is NOT an issue, then stay at the Grand Wailea, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it.

I wanted to spend our money doing the activities that people come to Maui enjoy like dining out, shopping, cruses, snorkleing ect. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful.

Now let me tell you about the staff...we had no idea where to go to get our marriage license, the staff gave us a printed map and set up our appointment, we had no minister to perform our ceremony, the staff set us up with the most wonderful minister in the world named Jesse, people who were also staying at the hotel came out and watched our ceremony, the grounds caretaker stopped what he was doing and he became our videotographer with great excitement, another couple who was staying there became our photographers. In our room I saw no sign of falling wallpaper or stains, our room was clean...after reading the review I was looking for these things. What I did see was geckos on the walls...but I thought they were real cute and was not bothered by them at all. The only bad thing I have to say about the Maui Lu is about the parking lot by the ocean view rooms...bad bad...bad, very narrow, very awkward very packed after 5pm.

It was our first time on the island. We read several books before traveling, including Maui Revealed and Fromers guide to Maui. I highly recommend the Maui Revealed book. It describes just about everything you need to know before you go, including restaurants, lodgings, and the sites you'll want to visit. We chose the Maui Lu even though some of the reviews were less complimentary. The Maui Lu is not the Hyatt. It is a quiet, comfortable relaxing hotel that is centrally located to just about anything on the island. What we found was a jewel. We selected a room facing the ocean for just a little more than the garden view rooms. The room was plain but clean and comfortable with a small refrigerator and two full size beds. We wanted a Queen, but those rooms were taken. The view from the Lanai was amazing with the ocean only 20 yards from our back door. The Maui Lu has a huge pool but at the time of our visit no hot tub. If your going to stay in the ocean front or side rooms, I would select the 2nd floor for more privacy. The staff was warm and friendly and kind. They exude the feeling of Aloha. The Maui Lu has a small cove, but is adjacent to a nice beach with plenty of space for stretching out for some sun. We often went into Kihei for coffee and the basics necessities. I recommend packing light and bring a big suit case and buying what you need there. The prices are pretty good and believe it or not, Hawaii has better hawaiian clothes than the mainland. If you plan any activities, a Luau is a must. The Royal Hawaiian Luau is usually sold out, so book your Luau before you go. We attended the Hyatt Regency Luau. Get there a hour before it starts for a great seat, otherwise sit in the back. The Hyatt has beautiful gardens and plenty to enjoy. We also attended Tony and Tina's Wedding, a theater production where you are a guest in a classic New York Bronx style ethnic wedding. That was so much fun. Skip the Dinner cruise out of Lahaina. Its a photo opportunity and ok food on a crowded boat, pricey and just ok.. Do consider a sail cruise to Molokini for snorlking and sunning. If you decide to drive around the island, splurge for a convertible or Jeep. While everyone drove the road to Hana we took the less traveled route around the other side of the island. The views were incredible. There are little artist communities open to the public and they enjoy talking about their work. Before we left, My girlfriend and I married on Maui Lu's little cove. That was two years ago.

The reviews of this hotel are all over the board. We were in the 400 building, which faces nothing but open ocean. The second floor has a better view, with no one walking by your room. Overall, the resort needs routine maintenance and our room needed the carpet and couch/chairs replaced. However, the room was clean with all amenities replaced as needed daily. They provide a coffeemaker and the first morning's coffee packet, and a refrigerator. The icemaker is a short walk to the 600 building. The 400 building has 2 beaches on either side, one a small cove and the other is walkable. The resort provides lounge chairs on the beach and a table and 2 chairs on your balcony. You definitely need a car in this area, as it is on a very busy road which is actually dangerous to walk on or even cross from the ocean side to the inner resort area where the pool is. The pool is large and deep (10'), but not heated - the ocean was actually warmer. But it is a lovely pool area. Apparently the pool is being refurbished in October. The parking lot for the 400, 500 & 600 buildings is extremely small and parking spaces are very tight. We stayed for 9 nights and did get a space all but 2 - the alternate lot is just across the street - not a big deal. The staff at the resort was very nice. We got this room at a great price through the Entertainment Book and it was a great value. I would recommend it to anyone not too fussy and we would stay there again. The trade winds were pretty constant in the afternoon and we got a bit tired of them; however, it would've been quite hot otherwise.

This was our first trip to Maui, and, despite the negative comments on this site, I booked a stay at the Maui Lu due to our positive experiences with Aston. It is also true, as another reviewer notes, that different visitors can see the same property on the same day and form entirely different opinions. We are very, very experienced travelers, very flexible and relatively undemanding, so I generally do not let negative comments -- especially from those I suspect are spoiled or inexperienced travelers -- sway me. Do not, under any circumstances, book a room at this resort unless you intend to rent a car. We made that mistake and felt totally stranded. My husband and our 11-year-old were especially listless, as the property is near absolutely NOTHING in terms of food, shopping or entertainment. It would help a great deal if the management would put out a bowl of fruit or a plate of breakfast pastries next to the coffee in the lobby. That way you could get something in your stomach before the cab ride into civilization. The grounds of this property are just beautiful, and you are cheating yourself not to walk outside and sit near the large trees and watch the birds. Yes, the rooms are older and in need of a little effort, but once that effort is made many of us will not be able to afford to stay there. I found ours clean and safe and adequate to our basic needs (sleeping and showering), and that is what I demand for whatever I pay, which at the Maui Lu was very little. I never travel with the hope of rooming at a property so wonderful that I need never leave it, as many do. That kind of attitude is hardly travel; it is insulation, and I can get that at home. I would stay at the Maui Lu again in a heartbeat, but I would rent a car with the money I saved on the room.

We knew it to be an older hotel, with the advantage of spacious and lovely grounds, beautifully kept. It was inexpensive and good value. The Maui Lu consists of several buildings. Three buildings are 2-storey oceanfront, beside two small sandy coves. Two of these buildings have marvellous ocean and sunset views. It would be lovely to stay there right by the water with the waves lapping all night long.The views from the third building (which I think was the 600 block) are obscured. Our room (in one of the buildings across the road on the land side in the 300 block ) was large, clean and obviously recently renovated with new curtains etc. The views from the buildings in this part of the resort have only garden views but they are pleasant. There are some cottages on the landward side that looked in need of renovation. The reviews for this resort are very mixed. Pehaps it depends on which building one stays in, and what one's expectations are. I would certainly recommend it for people who want good value and lots of space. I would personally rather stay beside their lovely garden than be right on the main road in Kihei looking out on to parking lots and overhead wires. If you are looking for the last word in luxury go spend lots of money in Wailea. If you can get one of the Maui Lu's oceanfront rooms it would be heaven. But be sure to ask for one with views. P.S.

I was originally staying at the Banana Bungalow hostel but personally it was too far from the nearest beach (4 miles) and without having transport just not good for me. So after checking what was available I moved down to Kihei. THis was the best thing I could have done. The Maui Lu is at the top end of the road that leads into Kihei so at the quieter end. Across the road from a lovely beach the location was perfect. It's a 20 minute walk into town so my one piece of advice is to get a car. Its cheap and so quite on the island it's well worth it to give you the freedom. A taxi into town costs $5 each way and there isn't public transport to speak of. The room was fine no complaints about that. Two double beds a good size balcony over looking nice gardens and a decent size bathroom. All of which were kept clean. I was on the second floor overlooking the pool and the gardens. As the front looks onto the pool you won't be awaken by kids diving in (not that there were any but you could during summer) It may look a little tired from the outside as most of the hotel is wooden so therefore there will be peeling of paint etc but nothing too major. The staff here were very friendly and would help me as much as they could as they knew I was a female travelling on her own. Joanie on the Pleasant Excursions desk is fab - she was really helpful and suggested I go whale watching. Around $30 to be picked up and dropped off and for a 2 1/2 trip out on the Prince Kuhio.

I would recommend the ocean front units especially the upper floor, the sunsets were truly remarkable with an island on each side in plain view, We were about 50 feet away from the shore and could hear the waves sliding up the shoreline all night, not a bug insight but the geckos were kind of cute, they like to stalk around the light fixtures outside, their about 3 to 5 inches long and I am assuming thats why the bugs aren't there.
