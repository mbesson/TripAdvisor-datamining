It was chosen from our travel agent on our group tour to Istanbul. Before getting to Turkey I sat down and read all the reviews that were written here. Judging from the reviews I would to have to deal with rude staff, things missing from my safe, no TV, no heat, no decent breakfast and so on. See I couldn't change the hotel, only my tour guide could, so I was prepared for the worst. First of all let me say that my stay at the Gran Star was overall a very pleasant and comfortable one. The room gave you a sense of warmth and coziness. The beds were very comfortable. The room and the bathroom were clean. We had a fridge, a lcd television with satellite receiver, hair dryer and a safe. The staff was very polite and willing to help. At least the people we interacted with. They didn't understand English well but if they didn't understand something they always tried to find someone who understood and did their best to help. After all in Istanbul English is not a common language. The staff's knowledge of English was on par with most of the shops or restaurants we went. Not much but not zero either. We used the safe and there never were any items or money missing from it. Even my personal items hold the same exact place where I left them on the table or chairs. About the TV, there is a tv set in the room which has only one Turkish channel but there is also a digital satellite receiver which is connected to the tv and has more than 200 free channels( English speaking channels like bbc and cnn included). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the hotels fault if someone uses only the TV and not the satellite receiver underneath it. The breakfast was nice and and with a fair number of choices. The food was fresh and very tasty. Of course there were a few quirks, but nothing serious. Would I stay there again?

Then I asked the receptionist please if anyone ask about me just say that I am not staying in this hotel, so what happened after is that someone came to ask about me at 3 am and they called my room to wake up me at this time even I didn't answer the phone! Another thing, I came to the reception to ask about the time that I should leave if my plane is at 8 pm! And the answer was u should pay full day, oh gosh! I wasn't talking about money, then the receptionist called a guy and the guy came as he is a big thing and said I am the captain of this hotel! I dnt care what ever u are, just give me a good service!

When i arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the guys at the reception who barely spoke English and would totally ignore you whilst you talk to them. Anyways we were given our two rooms and after getting some rest we decided to go for a stroll, came home and went to sleep. The second day however i got up early and went to a business meeting just outside of Istanbul then went had lunch and a some sight seeing. I got home around 1 AM, the following day i got up around 11 AM got ready and tried to open the safety box that was in my room. I put my code in and i got an error did it a couple more times and got the same error message. I decided to call reception who sent someone to the room to open the box. Minutes later a man came and opened the box by putting the master code. After he left i decided to check my things credit cards, money and passport. I was suspicious because normally i wouldn't get that error message unless somebody opened the box therefore my numbers didn't work. When i counted my money $2000 were missing, they left me barely enough money to get home. I was shocked and in disbelief. I ran to reception and asked to speak to the owner or manager or who ever is in charge. They called the manager and owner who did not at all seemed concerned nor interested in what i had to say. And instead of him being reassuring he was asking me questions like \" Are you sure you actually have this kind of money\" and \" Do you have any proof that you brought this money with you to Turkey\" and here i am trying to get this guy to believe me. He was coming up with all kinds of scenarios about me perhaps forgetting to lock the box before i left or maybe my colleague somehow being the culprit. There and then i knew that they were all in it together and it was all a setup because of their negative reaction, their lack of concern and the way i was treated. I then threatened to call the police if they didn't show me more respect and attention. The manager then waved a paper in my face that i had signed when i checked in, i did not even read it simply because i was checking into a supposedly a 4 star hotel i mean what could be on it so i simply signed it and never looked back. Well it turns out that this paper says that the hotel is not responsible for anything that goes missing in the rooms, and that the hotel has the right to sue me if any complaints are made. I asked the reception to call the police and they refused telling me \" if you want the police go to them yourself, we will not call them for you\". I went to the police and told them what had happened, they sent two guys with me to the hotel they started an investigation. After hours and hours of questioning one of police guys told me that there was noway i could get my money back, simply because i can not prove anything and that there is no chance that the hotel could be held accountable. Not only that but i run the risk of them pressing charges on me. So it would be a good idea to let it go and bite the bullet.

Sketchy\u201d", "Author": "foodtourist13", "ReviewID": "UR116178761", "Content": "I booked a room online at the Economic Star Hotel, and then found to my surprise and worry that the Economic Star Hotel didn't seem to exist! All I found out ahead of time was that the entrance was (suspiciously) the same as the Grand Star Hotel, but I felt at least relieved that I would have someone to talk directly to, in case things turned bad. I also sent them an email ahead of time and received a response (though not a very polite one). We arrived at the Grand Star Hotel and showed them our reservation number, and we were told that we had been \"upgraded\" to a room at the Grand Star Hotel. I asked about the Economic Star Hotel and was told that it was \"attached\" to the Grand Star, just behind it, and that the rooms were their more economic or standard rooms and that the Grand Star were the deluxe rooms, or something to that extent. So I believe that the Economic Star Hotel doesn't really exist, but is a way for the Grand Star Hotel to advertise rooms on online booking sites, perhaps at a cheaper price (we paid 80\u00e2\u201a\u00ac a night), but also under a different name to attract customers, since the Grand Star has some pretty bad reviews out there. The location, as noted, was the best thing about the hotel - a five minute walk, not even, from Taksim Square. The Grand Star Hotel room was nice - could've used vacuuming, but otherwise fairly luxurious (nice bedspreads and decoration, nice bathroom with an interesting shower with a shade that could be opened so the person in the shower can see into the room, and vice versa.. !!), though the shower door didn't shut completely and water got on the floor). The AC smelled bad, but we got used to it. Breakfast was good, with a variety of Western buffet items as well as some Turkish. Strangely, the fresh squeezed orange juice was an extra that was very overpriced, the equivalent of something like 3\u00e2\u201a\u00ac a glass. The staff, as has been noted, were not friendly in the least. The initial email I sent was responded to with a curt line, and they never greeted us when we came in or out of the hotel. But the worst is the way guests are treated on this website - being accused of breaking things, and having \"hysterical\" children? How incredibly unprofessional, unwarranted, and downright impolite! On that note, we signed an agreement at the beginning of the stay that we would have to pay for anything we broke in the room, which I've *never* seen at a hotel before. Considering that a recent reviewer says that they had to pay $150 for a broken glass (and, the hotel claims, a broken mini-bar door - but even so, a huge amount of money!), I was worried that I would be wrongly charged for the already broken shower door, or anything else, though fortunately I was not. Maybe they're trying to improve their reviews.

In fact they were curteus only when I ordered a transfer to the airport, guy insisted on paying directly to him and smiled only then.
