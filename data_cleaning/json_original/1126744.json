We booked the Aloha suite because we wanted to have our own bathroom. The room was big enough for us and it really felt like home. It was fully furnished just like your own house from extra towels to the fully equipt and stocked gourmet kitchen. We checked out the backyard and it was secluded, quiet and very well maintained. At the time we were there, there was just 1 other couple, but saw them just once because we had stuff to do and so did they. Our room came with breakfast and the owners left out breakfast items: 2 kinds of bread, butter and jelly, 2 types of cereal w/milk, 2 kinds of juices,coffee w/cream and sugar,tea,cocoa,3 types of fresh fruit,yogurt, It was a nice spread considering it is included with the room. We liked that we felt at home, we hung out in the parlor and they had direct tv. The weather at the time felt cool and airy with occassional sprinkles-well it is upcountry after all. The weather up there is so much more cooler and wet anyway. I highly recommend booking this place because it is just wonderful being in a place that is so relaxed, quiet, secluded and homey.

They were so friendly and helpful to recommend good beaches for the kids or kid-friendly restaurants. They know everyone in town, so when we wanted to go paddle-boarding, they hooked us up with somebody for lessons. When we wanted to hear live music, they had a friend playing at one of the restaurant clubs so everywhere we went, we could mention that Jeana sent us and all of a sudden we it was like we were old friends getting special treatment. Each morning, the kids would wake up and run around outside to gather fruit for our breakfast - guavas, bananas, loquats - fascinating. Several mornings, there was yoga offered in a large studio which was so refreshing and fun. I also had the opportunity to get a massage in the spa that was AMAZING!!!

I booked this after calling and asking for another room which was booked, I was told that the bamboo was like it at the same price. She told me the bamboo had just been remolded and was super nice and would work for our small family of 2 adults and a toddler. The other room I looked at was the same price and pretty large with tv, big kitchen area and plenty of room so I was thinking it would be the same. The pictures for the bamboo were not up on the website yet but I was told it had a full kitchenette with microwave. After we booked I asked if they had a crib to use, they did but it was a $15 charge. When we got there we were surprised to find a tiny, shabby \"cottage\" which was actually an old work shop or small converted garage attached to the owners house. First the bathroom does not have a sink or any counter space. So you have to use the sink in the \"kitchen\" to brush your teeth. The shower floor was stained and grimy and there were several holes in the walls. The towels were mismatched and had large stains. The room is so small that there was good 5 inches between the bed and the small crib they charged us to use. The crib was actually a bassinet and when I placed my toddler into it she could easily step out and she was level with the cords from the window blinds.. not safe at all, so we did not use it and got a refund. The kitchette was not really usable either, we only attempted one meal here. No microwave, just a two burner hotplate and a small toaster oven. Cooking utensils were lacking, no measuring cups for liquids and no counter space to put anything or chop anything. The counters were not finished and a grass skirt was hiding some of the raw 2x4's that were holding up the sink. There is no fan in the kitchen or bathroom so it steamed up the whole place when I tried to cook. There is no closet to put anything, no room for a suitcase. No tv since there is no place to put it. If you decide to stay here I would suggest renting out the main house to use, which is very nice. The other \"cottages\" on the property looked a lot better than the bamboo, and since it was the same price we felt ripped off. But if the service had been good many of the inconveniences could have been over looked. The owners as not really friendly it feels like they are too busy to chat with you or give you any recommendations besides trying to sell you on there own \"services\" like the massages she gives or the tours they will take you on for a price. Not once were we asked if we had everything we needed or if they could help. They also charged us a $50 cleaning fee. There was a check list of instructions of what was supposed to be done before check out. We had to take out our own trash separate the recycling, clean the bathroom, wipe down all the counters with cleaners (good thing there weren't any) clean and wipe out the mini fridge. So we did all of this and spent a good deal of time getting the place back good as it was. So after all this I was thinking we would get a refund on the cleaning fee since there was nothing left for them to clean. But no, you have to clean it yourself and pay them to clean it. The location is out of the way to say the least.

Even with the windows open, air circulation was very limited. During this weekend, the owners had also decided to host a large party for friends and neighbors in their spacious backyard. This event went well into the evening and was rather noisy, especially with the back and forth passing of several cars on the gravel path just outside our window for several hours. To minimize the noise, we needed to close the windows and endure the still heat of the room. I wish the owners would have alerted us to the fact that there would be an event that weekend, and that the peace, quiet and \"zen-like\" atmosphere that is touted on their website might be compromised.

It was nice and cool at night which made it perfect sleeping weather and the sky, well it was lit up with stars like we have never seen before! Definitely take the time to look up at night and see some shooting stars! The room had a nice zen style to it and a comfy king size bed, bamboo flooring, coffee maker, satellite tv (since the world cup was on it was a must). Location Was good because Maui is a BIG island and it takes time to get places so here is a nice idea were its located. Near the town makawao. 15 minutes from paia which is an awesome town to eat especially at the paia fish market(best fresh fish tacos on island along with best fresh fish and best value!) paia has a beach and is nice but nothing compared to the \"big beach\" by makena (45 minutes) but go early because the beaches are really good before about 1:30 then the clouds and wind move in quickly and it's not so pleasant. Also you are near the Hana highway and about 15-20 minutes from the first waterfall site twin falls. Just in case you dont know, hana highway is one of the most beautiful drives you can take and has all sorts of different waterfalls and fresh water pools its basically paradise. It's a must see but it can get tiresome driving from the resort areas on the island,so your in a great location to start the drive. And dont worry about a guide book because they have great ones in the rooms library! Staying at the hale hoomana your in a great location to see Maui. We drove through the other towns and did not like the vibe, we felt it was nicer here than being confined to a resort or these towns. We enjoyed being surrounded by nature and quietness was better for us. Four star comfort and room, for the value, location and whole package it gets high marks from us. To get an idea of places we have stayed as a barometer: iberostar grand punta cana 5-star, Couples swept away jamaica 4.5-5 star, jw Marriott cancun 4.5-5 star. This place is not like those hotels but it's not meant to be, it's perfect for what we wanted. To summarize, good location, close to great food at a even better value, very nice, comfy, and quiet rooms. Must eats paia fish market for lunch and dinner Komoda? deli and bakery for awesome creme puffs, donuts on a stick, buttered sweet bread, and oatmeal raisin cookies. Paia flat bread for great pizza (outside of NYC of course) Ulanana? Shaved ice in lahaina. Great shaved ice! Not sure of the spelling on all of these places but if you check restaurants in Maui on trip advisor you'll find them. We spent 7 days here and loved it.
