By Venice standards, it offers superb value for money. We arrived mid morning off the night train from Paris to a very friendly welcome. Our room (107) was already available and was clean and bright with a wonderful view out over the lagoon through a large opening window. The buffet breakfast each morning was quite a revelation: fresh fruit, fruit pulp, cereals, meat (including freshly sliced ham), cheese, small tubs of pate, rolls, croissants, jams, a coffee machine dispensing various types of coffee (and freshly grinding the beans for each cup), orange and grapefruit juice (also from a machine) etc. The nice part was that the lady in charge of the buffet was constantly topping it up, so it didn't matter what time you came down for breakfast, you always had a full choice. If you want a \"posh\" hotel in the heart of the action with big bedrooms and bathrooms, this is not the place for you, but if you want a professionally run, clean, friendly establishment where you can sleep peacefully, wake up to the sights and sounds of the lagoon, watch the locals standing round putting the world to rights and taking their dogs for a walk, and enjoy a great buffet breakfast, then I can't think of anywhere better in Venice. Yes, you're about a 15 minute stroll from St. Mark's, but what a place to stroll - along the edge of the lagoon! And, of course, there are the vaporetti stops just a couple of hundred metres away at Arsenale from where you can get to anywhere. In the evening, after enjoying the wonderful sunsets, eat where you see the locals eating along Via Garibaldi and other nearby streets.

Would recomend Ristorante Giorgione,just down Via Garibaldi, and book or get there by 7. Charming, good food, about 60 euro for 2, good value. We came by train from Paris -I thouhgt it would be like the Orient Express, deluxe cabin and amazinf restaurant car for romatic dinner (see Angelina Jolie in The Tourist). In reality, the carriage is like a broom cupboard-and as the restaurant staff were on strike and often are -f so no restarant car, food was limited to a weird crossant and an 'orange' drink. Luckily we bought some foodf at the station buffet so did not starve. Avoid water taxis at the station, for 12 Euro, vs *0, the vaporetto is a great way to spend and hour going down the Grand Canal, ditto from the airport. It is a 5 min luggage pull from Arsenale to the hotel. On the way back, going to the airport we treated ourselves to a water taxi, 100 euros as advised by the hotel (their website says 80,( probably 2 weeks out of date..). It only took 30 minutes. When we arrived my wife got off, I handed her the bags, got off myself and gave the driver 100 euros. He pointed to a sign that said \"110 euros to Venice\". I said 'maybe , but I'm coming from Venice and the hotel said a 100, so there it is'. Sadly for him, we were on dry land with our bags and he was stuck in his boat..........

It was at the end of our trip and the only hotel we stayed in. We had an apartment in Paris and Rome and stayed at a friends in Siena. Despite the fact the hotel had less amenities we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was clean, easy to find (in Venice), had a great view outside, and was away from the craziness by a block or two yet close to San Marco square. The biggest perk was the location to me. it is on the water outside the grander canal making it one of the easiest hotels to find in Venice. Which is a big deal. we weren't in the room much but when we needed to be it was quick and easy to find. It was also very close to the airport water taxi. It is a 45 minute ride at 15 euros but is only a block and one small bridge away. Believe me this is close. The hotel room had a fridge we didn't use as an added benefit. Now what prevented me from giving it a full 5 in everything... I don't rate on stars of a hotel but on experience. As I said before this was the last days of our trip. We needed to have WiFi which this hotel claimed to have. I was told to sit in a corner of the lobby where the WiFi did not work. I was unable to confirm my flight and pick up and respond to important emails. Thankfully on our last night a place down the street had free WiFi with a glass of wine and I confirmed our flight saving time at the airport. The second issue was when we arrived (via train so different water taxi) I asked so a map describing the airport taxi wand asked where the stop was. The person told me it was too far to walk and I had to take the regular taxi to the other side to catch it. He said it would take 1.5 hours but a personal taxi company they use could get us there in 30 minutes for 120 euros plus tip. I did not believe this and asked a different person our last day and he said that was incorrect and the water taxi to the airport was a block away and a max of 45 minutes. The first person was the same man who insisted that they had WiFi and my computer and phone didn't work. I felt he was getting taxi kickback and would warn that this is possible so be careful.

The elevator was very tiny. Small enough to only fit two people! The tv in the room did not work. Check-in was easy and you need to provide your passport upon arrival. Every time you leave the hotel, you need to leave your room key at the desk (this was odd to me). The hotel also had an odd set-up.

Having tried a few other hotels before finding Ca Formenta, I now use this hotel for its service, quiet location and beautiful setting from the front. I spotted Ca Formenta on my first trip to Venice on the Alilaguna boat from the Airport as it speeded towards Venice proper from the Lido stop and I thought at the time what a wonderfully, easily found location it was in; I made a mental note to try it sometime. On my last trip at the end of March/beginning of April, I stayed there for the second time. This time there was a large bowl of fresh fruit waiting for me from the management in my room. All the staff there are brilliant and so much more friendly and customer focussed than any of the other 7 hotels I have stayed at in Venice My single room was small (but so are many rooms in Venice hotels and not just the singles) and well maintained. It was very well priced and although it would have been lovely to have a room with a view across the Bacino to San Georgio Marggiore, I don't mind paying less and getting an economy room as this means I can go back to Venice several times a year. Besides in the Spring, Summer and early Autumn who wants to sit in a hotel room when you can be outside with that view. My one and only gripe was that I don't think that the bathroom floor was as clean as it could have been, with several stains or water marks. I don't think it got washed down before I arrived or during my stay. The rest of the small bathroom including the shower unit, surrounds and tray were immaculately clean. The Ca Formenta is located in between the Arsenale and Giardini/Biennale vaporetti stops. It is so nice to sit outside for breakfast in front of the Bacino/ Lagoon watching the different boats shuffle up and down, looking down the Riva Schiavigeni towards San Marco/San Georgio Maggiore/Salute or just watching the local Venetians taking their children to school or walking their dogs. No milling crowds of day tourists in this vicinity, but some pretty decent restaurants down the Via Garibaldi. Try the Trattoria Giorgione on the left just down from the Hotel. I had an enjoyable dinner there one evening for a reasonable price and good quality food. Around 9.30pm the owner takes up a guitar and microphone and sings to his customers - better than most singing gondoliers. The rest of the customers were very friendly and I did not feel awkward being there on my own. If you go to Torcello, try the Restaurant Villa 600 opposite the rustic Cipriani's by the little bridge infront of the church. Villa 600 offers a three course lunch for 24 euros or a wider range of tasty options. Or just grab a capucino and a slice of gateau or a cool drink. Service there is impeccable in beautiful surroundings, I have eaten there several times for lunch and have never been disappointed. The wine list is very reasonably priced too, More Venetian than the tourist traps around San Marco, another nice thing is that on the waterfront by the Ca Formenta there are great marble/concrete blocks all along the front for about a mile where you can sit and watch the great sunsets towards San Marco or take a rest during the day and enjoy a great ice-cream from Via Garibaldi. Locals fish along this spot too. The Alilaguna boat from the airport stops at the Arsenale but I don't bother with lugging my luggage over the 2 bridges (but only a short walk) to the Ca Formenta, instead I stay on the floating pontoon and wait for a no 1 vaporetto in the direction of the Lido to go one stop to the Giardini and then walk up the broad, tree lined avenue in front of you to the Via Garibaldi and then turn left and walk down the street towards the waterfront and Ca Formenta. This way no steps up and down bridges to contend with luggage. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to San Marco but what a walk and what a view. . . Finally, f you have been to Venice before and are familiar with the Vaporetti, the 82 has now become No 2 ( and don't get on a No 3 because those are for the local inhabitants only although it is not that clear on the notice boards). The Orange Venicecard with Alilaguna from/to the airport was 104 euros for 7 days last week, sounds expensive but not really when you work out what you get for it and what you would pay separately for each trip/visit /journey, visit to the loo etc otherwise.

Bit panicky, due to being female and travelling on my own. However, the night boat was still running to the nearby Giardini stop, and I was so relieved to find a night porter waiting up for me (I couldn't get through on the phone, for some reason). However, the downside to being a solo traveller is so often the tiny room you get. In this case, it was really small, with no view at all and a slightly scruffy carpet, I have to say. Having read the other reviews, I'm sure this room is an exception, but be aware that not all the rooms have a view here. The bathroom was small, but well equipped (great shower) and everything was clean, with friendly staff. Breakfast was fine but, as a veggie, I couldn't eat the cheese because it was in a mixed display with the meat - but there was plenty of choice. The location is perfect - I loved being away from the madness of St Marks and Rialto, and spent most evenings near the Acadamia bridge.

Then a 30min vaporetto ride to the stop nearest to the hotel. Next time I would try to fly into San Marco where the transit time is shorter. We found it worth buying a 72hour vaporetto pass.

There are more luxurious places to stay, and certainly many more expensive ones. But if you want good quality and a reasonable price, this is the place to go. Step out of the front door and you see what must be one of the finest sights on earth: San Giorgio Maggiore, the Salute at the mouth of the Grand Canal, San Marco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campanile. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a few minutes walk to San Marco itself but C\u00c3\u00a0 Formenta is beyond the hordes and the tourist tat around the Piazza. In fact, Via Garibaldi is where very ordinary Venetian life carries on impervious to tourists. So it also has some useful food shops, places to eat, a post office more or less opposite the hotel. My room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a view (some have) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather, the view was into a tiny \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCorte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, washing hanging from the window. But all of Venice is a room with a view so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter. It was on the ground floor, with a decent sized bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean, as was every other bit of the hotel I saw. It has all been tastefully refurbished. Mini-bar in the room (handy to have a little fridge), satellite TV (improbably, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLista canali TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122/ TV channels included BBC in English. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but no matter; I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Venice to sit in and watch the BBC.) The heating and the air conditioning were both very efficient. Breakfast is a continental buffet in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreakfast room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and is also excellent for the kind of establishment this is: choice of cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, croissants, cheese etc. Very much better than a 3* London hotel. All of the staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is a slight misnomer by UK experience: it is bed and breakfast only. You later realise that the seven sets of tables and chairs beyond the reception entrance are in fact the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreakfast room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. It works perfectly well but there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclounge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as such. This area also becomes a small bar, until 9pm. My only quibble about my stay is that I was woken every morning by the sound of the breakfast tables being laid, as it was the first of the downstairs rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this was not at an ungodly hour, but earlier than I would have chosen. This is balanced by the fact that this is the quietest hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in, even tough it seemed to be full: no slamming doors through the night; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not big enough for large groups.

This hotel sits at the (quiet) end of Venice nearest the residential section, but within easy walking distance of St. Mark's Square. The staff was excellent (though our boyish concierge could have been a tad less snooty). Breakfast is served in the lobby every morning consisting of muffins, yogurt, cereal, coffee or cappucino, etc... You can take this in the lobby or outside sitting at an umbrella-shaded table on the edge of the beautiful wide street (no cars anywhere on the islands!). Hotel summary: quiet, clean, recently refurbished, great location, fair price. Beautiful, beautiful city - lots to look at, such atmosphere! Wander around - we never once felt unsafe (even wandering around at 1a) and there's just so much to see! While *you* may find good restaurants somewhere, our experience with the well-reviewed restaurants we hit was that food was awful across the board - do not get suckered in, you will likely be disappointed. While Florence restaurants were *great*, and Rome's were at the very least good, Venice was dispiritingly bad. My recommendation would be to keep expectations for food low and stick with pizza, panini, beer, wine and gelato - laugh, drink, wander about. Save the food money for Florence or Rome. Getting around Venice - do not listen to anyone who tells you that you'll be looked down on for wearing tennis/walking shoes - nearly everyone during the day time is an obvious tourist wearing tennis shoes - and you will 100% need *very* comfortable shoes as you unavoidably climb and descend close to 1,000 steps a day. We listened to the 'don't bring tennis shoes' and ended up overpaying for a pair (75 Euro for walking shoes) to save my girlfriend's rapidly blistering feet (after only a day and a half) Here's a tip if you are flying in to Marco Polo and going directly to Venice - pay the extra and take one of the water taxis directly to the hotel. It'll save lots of time, lots of effort lugging your bags up and down the everpresent steps (don't underestimate this), and it affords a staggering and beautiful view of the city - who needs a gondola ride after this (at the same price, no less)? Top it all off? Ca' Formenta has a tiny dock so the water taxi delivers you right to the proverbial doorstep and the hotel staff handles the baggage transfer to your room.

I got prices off a few of the travel sites but ended up emailing & booking direct with the hotel for the best deal, all communication with the hotel was prompt & consice. We arrived late afternoon at the airport & caught the public water taxi which was an unusual & great way to start the vacation, it dropped us off just a few minutes walk from the hotel. We purchased a 4day travel pass for the water taxi which we found a great way to travel, although sometimes pretty crammed in, they were much better than the usual humdrum taxis, buses, tubes etc in most big cities; we hopped on off at diferrent places throughout Venice stopping in between for leisurely walks, drinks & snacks as we explored the superb sites. We were not dissapointed with the hotel, it was pretty much as outlined in many of the reviews, a small friendly place in a great venetian location right next to the lagoon & a nice 10 minute stroll from the hustle & bustle nearer the city centre. We also enjoyed walking the opposite way to the centre exploring the venetian areas & having a drink or ice cream with the friendly locals. We mainly ate our evening meals in the restuarants close to the hotel which were all reasonable & friendly. After a meal on our anniversary night we sat outside & watched England play in a football world cup match (who said romance was dead !?); we sat with many nationalities & other hotel guests & had a great evening followed by a few headaches the next morning. The weather was sunny & warm during our stay & we ate breakfast each morning outside the hotel watching the world go by - fantastic. We never experienced any bad water smells that a few other travellors had mentioned but we did go in June & maybe things get a bit worse late summer after a few hot months ? We have visited many large cities throughout the world but we found the whole Venice experience magical, assisted by oneoffs like the water taxis & no traffic + the many interesting places to visit. Yes the centre was very busy at times, but generally we got round OK & loved the place as being totally different. Of course we had to do 'The Gondola' on our anniversary - expensive but it had to be done & we took some great memories back with us . We'll definately go again at some stage in the future (possibly 5+years as we do like to visit other places) & we'd certainly recommend the Ca'Formenta........it's not vast, it's not glitzy, but it's nice, it's friendly, it's a decent price & it's in a good location, nice & quite but only a short interesting walk from the centre. The hotel remembered from my booking that it was our anniversary & sent a complimentary bottle of champers to our room on the day which was a nice touch. All in all we had a great time, well recommened for a few days vacation. Hope this review helps others, if you go hope you have as nice a time as we did.

We spent 4 nights at the Ca Formenta, and on arrival we were shown to our room (203) and given a complimentary bottle of prosseco. The room was more than adequate along with the breakfast. Plenty of choice - cereals, rolls, crispbreads, fresh fruit etc. Staff were really helpful and friendly and the location was excellent - near the vaporetta stop with easy access to the airport and surrounding islands (Murano etc). As for Venice itself both my husband and myself were a little disappoined with it on the whole. We were glad that we had picked the week after carnival to visit as it was quiet and queue free. The Peggy Guggenheim was a real treat - and we did go into the Basillica, but as the weather was so good we just meandered around. One definate eating place for the evening is the Casa Di Noble found not far from the Accedamia bridge - a real treat and not expensive - beware of drinking or eating near St Marks sq - as prices there are a complete rip off. We also went to one of the many Vivaldi concerts - it was OK but no where as good as a concert that you may see in London - although the ticket price was just as expensive and the concert only lasted 1 hour. Make sure you look inside the venue before purchasing your tickets, and make sure you know how many instrumentalists there will be, as the pamphlet often displays more than is actually playing on the night.

We arrived via Ryan air from Liverpool and got the airport bus into the Piazzale Roma (9 euro return) and as advised we bought 25 euro three day waterbus passes which you definitely need if only to get from Piazzale Roma to the Arsenale Waterbus stop and back again. You can take the number 42 or the number 1 but definitely go for the slower number 1 because your first hour in Venice will be a magical cruise right down the length of the Grand Canal past Rialto, Academia and of course St Marks and the Doges Palace. Get off at Arsenale and turn right and head in the same direction as the boat which has just dropped you off. You go over one bridge and the walk about 200 metres to another bridge which you cross and then the hotel is virtually the fist building on the via Garibaldi which is actually more of residential neighbourhood but it is only 10 minutes walk from St Marks. Everyone who arrives in Venice has to drag their cases so travel light and stay at the Ca Formenta because its easy to find (5 mins from Arsenale) and you wont have to spend half an hour dragging your case around the streets and over the bridges. You could of course opt for a water taxi but the 20 minute 2km ride from from Piazzale Roma to the front door will set you back about 50 euro and you don't want to get your pants pulled down in your first hour in Venice now do you!!! By the way don't even think about walking it unless you know your way around Venice and you have absolutely no luggage. The hotel staff were friendly and the breakfast was o.k. Our room was on the ground floor so it had no view but it did have a great bath and shower which was nice to relax in after a hectic day in Venice. It was warm and clean and most importantly for us, quiet. There are two restaurants close by. Both with similar menus and prices. The Giorgione food was good but you had to wait for an hour to get it and they don't seem too fond of tourists whereas the Garangala is much friendlier with much faster service. Venice is a beautiful one of a kind island city. It is very small and easy to get around both on foot and by waterbus but allow yourself plenty of time to get places. 2 kms on a waterbus can take along time even on one of the faster ones. Don't worry if you feel like you are bobbing up and down all the time even when your on dry land. Apparently everyone does. Venice is expensive but we paid \u00c2\u00a365 a night for the room in the centrally located Ca Formenta and only \u00c2\u00a325 quid each for the flights but its easy to blow a few hundred euro during a three day stay in Venice without doing any thing extravagant like a gondola ride or having a drink in St Marks.

Some rooms had beautiful views, including ours, except at the time we were there, they were doing some repairs and scaffolding blocked the view. No worries. We loved it anyway. The place is SPOTLESS. The front desk help was nothing short of fabulous. They went above and beyond in helping with helpful hints, restaurant recommendations and, more important to us, a bit of history of Venice. Breakfast, although it is called continental style, was just spot on. It is selve serve, but filling, tasty and a nice selection. Our room was small but just wonderful. Three of us traveled together and we never felt cramped. Bathroom was just brand shiny new. I can think of NOTHING negative to say about this place, and my only reluctance in posting a review of it is that it will become TOO popular and change! One suggestion on Venice. Bring your pocketbook if you like to shop because it is shopper's paradise. Small and elegant city, restful and relaxing without any hustle bustle, and delightful in every way.

Ca Formenta was our 2nd stop. Well what can I say\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6? Glorious!!! Location, service, staff. First let me state my circumstances. This started out as a 70th birthday gift for my mum. The trip took a great deal of planning because mum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as good with the walking as she used to be so we had a wheelchair along for comfort and safety; when mum gets tired pull out the wheelchair and keep on going. So all hotels had to either have a lift or accommodation on the ground floor and the room would have to have separate beds. We also needed a hotel that had its own wharf. Since we were traveling for weeks and many stops, we had lots of luggage. I had read other reviews where people talked about getting off at the closest waterbus stop and lugging their luggage over bridges to the hotel. Clearly this was not an option for us. I had to make this trip as pain free as possible so mum could relax and really enjoy herself. Boy, did I luck out with Ca Formenta. At the airport we hired a private water taxi that would take us straight to the hotel (should have reserved it on line ahead of time. Might have been cheaper. As it was, I paid about 120 euro which included the shuttle from the airport to the water taxi.) The ride, our first sight of Venice, was glorious. What a perfect place!! Anyway, the moment we arrived we were met at the dock by housekeeping who were ready to take care of our luggage (6 pieces plus a wheelchair) and were guided to the front desk where I was eagerly greeted by Simone Contin, a young gentleman who isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the manager of the hotel but easily could and should be. Apparently he was the one answering my many e-mails, always providing specific answers to the tons of questions I asked. After a 2 minute check in we were escorted to our room, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superior twin room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd overlooking the Grand canal and local \u00e2\u20ac\u0153street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (weird to call it that when the only traffic is on foot.). En-suite bathroom, of course. The room was lovely. Everything seemed brand new. We had two windows, one huge one that could open fully to bring in the beautiful breeze, and a double glass door that opened up to a small balcony. Lovely. I stood on the balcony and took many a picture. You can see all the neighborhood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities from that balcony. And since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in the heart of stuff (literally a 10 minute walk to St.Marks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Square. 15 if you want to stroll which I strongly recommend!!!!!) you really get a sense of how everyday residents live. The hotel provides a continental breakfast in the morning with consists of breads, deli meats, cheese, cereal, fruits, tea, coffee, and juices. I would have preferred a full \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd breakfast but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to matter much; our bellies were full and quite satisfied and we certainly did a lot of tasting at the various cafes and restaurants throughout the city. Anyway, Simone was instrumental in helping us plan our 3 days in Venice. The hotel provided free transportation to Murano (known thorough out the world for glass art) and a free tour of one of its\u00e2\u20ac\u2122glass factories, and arranged tickets for us to see a jazz concert. Simone was also very helpful in directing me to the best place to find traditional Comedia Del Arte masks. The rest of our time was spent strolling San Marco, visiting the various museums and shops and, of course traveling the town on the Gondola. Taking the water buses from one place to the next was also a treat. Oh what an amazing place. Thank you, Simone and staff, for making our stay in your city such a magical one. I will definitely be back and will not stay anywhere else!!! A word of caution; travel light. Because mum and I had so much luggage (coming from the US into Europe we were well within the restrictions) we got hit with HUGE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excess fees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when traveling the intra-continental airlines servicing Europe alone. EasyJet, BMI baby, flybe, etc. charge between 5 and 8 euro for any kilo over 40 for each person. As insane as it sounds now, for each flight (and we went to Venice, Rome, Paris, and England) be paid around 400euro for excess weight!!!! \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ouch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is an understatement. EasyJet does not inform you of any weight restriction on their website and there is no number that you can call from the US.

The location of this hotel can't be beat for those looking for a peaceful & calm alternative to the loud & bustling area surrounding St. Mark's Square or the Rialto Bridge. One of the nicest things was approaching the Arsenale Vaporetti stop & noticing our hotel in the distance. After all of our extensive research it felt comfortable already. Prior to our arrival we sent numerous emails to the hotel staff and consistently received prompt responses. We were able to secure a rate of Euro 110 per night which was extremely reasonable for Venice. Our check-in was quick & the staff was quite accomodating with our luggage. Our room was situated towards the back of the hotel near the entrance to the patio. The recently renovated room was decorated in a rich color palette of blue and gold with a safe, television, phone, alarm clock and comfy double bed. It was a tad on the small side, but you will only spend time in your room to shower & sleep. It looked out onto a courtyard the hotel shared with local residences & we had views of laundry hanging between the buildings. Our only negative experience was the extremely narrow shower. After a day of sightseeing, it wasn't enjoyable to navigate a shower door. Just be careful not to drop your soap! Unfortunately, we didn't utilize the patio since we had such a limited time in Venice (only had a chance to sneak a peak). The hotel itself is located in a wonderful Venetian neighborhood with delicious restaurants nearby. Breakfast is set up in the main lobby of the hotel. Our plans only permitted us to have one breakfast at the hotel, but it was generously stocked with fruits, cereal, cold cuts, juices and, of course, coffee. It was a sufficient way to start the morning. The hotel is a ten minute walk to St. Mark's, but with such wonderful views we strolled our way there enjoying the ambience of the city. The greatest experiences of Venice lie in the backstreets-tour the main sights & then let yourself get lost in the neighborhoods. You won't regret that decision for a moment. We asked the desk clerk for some restaurant recommendations & he quickly responded with some great choices less than a block down from the hotel. One of the most delightful experiences of our time in Venice came at the Ristorante Al Giorgione just down the block from the hotel. We were seated with locals in what seemed to be an extension of the kitchen, eating delicious food (their specialty is seafood), soaking in the atmosphere while being serenaded by a delightful band dressed as gondoliers. At that moment we realized how happy we were with our decision to stay in this ideal neighborhood of Venice. Upon our exit of the restaurant a private party was being held in the front and as we made our way out we were greeted by the owners as well as the guests. It was a comfortable feeling & a wonderful way to spend our last night in Venice. Our second dinner recommendation would be Trattoria Alla Madonna (located near the Rialto Bridge). We had dinner there our first night & were impressed by their perfectly prepared seafood and knowlegable staff. Get there as close to open as possible otherwise you'll be standing in a line that stretches out the door! The weather was ideal for early November-mostly sunny with ideal temperatures (light jacket required). It did rain our last night there & well into the morning. If you travel in the fall or spring, be sure to bring an umbrella. The staff of the hotel were quite helpful with our plans from the beginning through the end of our stay.

Although some paint was peeling off the walls, (seems to be a common occurance) it was a great place to stay. We walked to the hotel for Breakfast each morning and their selection was outstanding. There is a supermarket down the street if you wanted to cook your own food. The front desk was very helpful. They gave us a bottle of Prosecco for our honeymoon. We bought a 3 day Vaparetto pass for 22 Euros per person which allowed us to jump on and off all day at all the stops to explore Venice. We took the Alilaguna to the airport for 10 Euros from the Arsenale stop. We lucked out with having ramps over the bridges due to the marathon that was run the week prior so we did not have to drag our luggage over the steps. Be sure to go to the airport early even though we were told 1 hour was sufficient. We went almost 3 hours early and it was still a nightmare.

I thought that I had made a mistake by not booking a lagoon view but we were in a room at the rear of the hotel and it was perfect. It was the quietest hotel room we have had in years. Good size and had room for a small table and two chairs where a bottle of Prosecco was waiting for us on arrival - because we were there for a long stay apparently. We had two windows with views of the canal. Lovely bathroom en suite. Breakfast set us up each day for lots of walking and sightseeing. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. We bought Venice Cards online before going and included the Allilaguna trips to and from the airport at half price. The Card was invaluable - gave us access to some museums as well - and we hopped on and off the boat as often as we liked, including trips to Murano and Lido. We were up and down the Grand Canal like yoyos. Other visitors have mentioned the steps on the two bridges between the stop and the hotel and this could be a problem for some people. We are 'older' travellers and managed this although tired after a 3 hour flight delay. During our stay ramps were put up over the two bridges for the Venice Marathon which meant that the walk to the stop for the return journey was easy. The taxi from hotel to airport was quoted at 85 euros which is a lot for two people especially since the Allilaguna fare was already paid. We would also have had the wonderful view behind us. We ate the first night at Giorgione - just up the street - and had a lovely meal but we tried to go somewhere different every time. We had only one meal that we were unhappy with and, unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of the restaurant. All food was Italian but for the lunch at Gam Gam, a Jewish restaurant, in the Ghetto area, which was truly memorable - can be reached by the No. 42. Apparently best to book for the evenings. I am vegetarian and had been given lots of advice on the Tripadvisor Forum which I used. Didn't care for the Coperto or cover charge added in addition to the service charge in lots of restaurants but it varied quite a bit and some made a point of stating that there was no charge and service was included. I would be amazed if anyone had a bad stay in this hotel - people were being turned away during our stay because it was fully booked. I hope to return to Venice some day and will definitely stay at the Ca Formenta. We also went to two concerts which were wonderful - although they each only lasted around an hour.

There is a money machine and post office right across the street. The people at the front desk were always very helpful. When arriving in Venice (at the train station) with luggage, I would advise taking a water taxi to this hotel because the vaporetto stop (Arsenale) is a short distance from the hotel but you need to go over 2 sets of stairs (not an easy task with luggage). The water taxi takes you right to the hotel back door. It should not cost more than 65 euro (with luggage) from the train station. It was 80 euro for us because we had 6 women and lots of luggage.
