We booked in on Easter Monday & hotel seemed very quiet, no evening food available that night, but we had read other reviews on Trip Advisor, & walked round the corner to Mirkos. This was a friendly restaurant, carafes of house wine recommended, with an English version of the menu. Continental breakfast, but staff are happy to cook bacon & eggs, you just have to ask. Getting into Rome was really easy, get the 709 bus on the opposite side to the shopping centre, & get off at EUR Termini, then Metro in. We got off at the Colosseum (wow, what a sight as soon as you leave the Metro station) & you can walk the rest. Aris Garden sell the bus tickets, 1 Euro each way per person. You just have to click the ticket in the machines on the bus to validate. 4 ticket inspectors boarded the bus on one of our journeys into Rome, & caught out several locals who hadn't got tickets. They had to get off the bus, and were fined 50 Euros on the spot, so be warned. We found Rome to be very expensive as expected. We decided to come back to Aris Garden, get freshened up & eat at Mirkos, which was considerably cheaper. Also we were glad to relax away from the bustle of Rome after a hard day of sightseeing on your feet all day. We must have walked miles. We did have one evening snack at Aris Garden, both had lasagne, with a bottle of wine, which was very nice & not too expesive. Be aware that you have to pay a government tax of 3 Euros per person per night, so add that to your costing. Our room was on floor 6 right at the end, but the lift worked well.

The hotel is very pretty and round the corner is a great choice of shops less than a 2 minute walk away. There you will find a great place to eat called mirkos the owner is fab, doesn't speak much english but very sweet and funny! The bakery is incredible and the little shop a few doors down does sandwiches and cigarrettes etc they are also lovely, But I have to say the absolute highlight of the hotel is Sonia the waitress she was such a lovely sweet and warm woman, our little boy adored her, she made a fuss of him daily and could not do enough to help us, it was a sad departure with a genuine Italian farewell with hugs and kisses all round, congratulations to all the staff for creating such a lovely warm environment, the decor is a little dated but to be honest it only adds to the charm.

Staff were very friendly & helpful. The decor was traditional if not alittle dated and perhaps needed some TLC in places, but that didnot detract from the overall service. The best way to get to this hotel is via taxi from the airport as it's nearer the airport than Rome centre (approx 10 miles). Be prepared to use local transport to commute to the centre of Rome. The local buses were frequent and the stops were around the corner from the hotel so within easy walking distance. The bus drops you at the \"Termini\" where you then need to jump on Metro Line B which speeds you into the centre. The commute took approx 30-40 mins. Transport around Rome is very easy, Day Tickets & 3-Day Tickets can be bought(4 to11 Euros), enabling you to jump on and off buses, trams or metro. There's limited local nightlife being \"out-of-town\", but there was an excellent family run taverna round the corner. They were very welcoming, and by the end of the week we felt like part of the family! I got an excellent deal on this hotel, making it fantastic value for money. I probably paid a third of the cost for a hotel in the centre of Rome. If you don't mind a bit of commuting I would recommend this hotel as a good base for sightseeing in Rome.

The hotel staff were lovely as they looked after this single female traveller and her little nephew. Bus times, directions all in English to help me understand. The breakfasts are better than the standard fare on package holidays and as the previous reviews suggested I tried MIrkos, in fact we had our own seats by the end of the week! This hotel completely suited our needs, a pool break with links to the city for a little adventure. Getting to Rome is easier than getting to the beach although all possible on bus and metro. The coast isnt the prettiest and the public beaches are hard to access and obviously not receiving the most investment but the views from the beach make up for it. The biggest challenge about picking this hotel is getting from the airport. Technically the cheapest route is to go in towards Rome and out again via metro. The taxi would have cost us about \u00a370 well over any amount registered in the hotel information , however the taxi driver took pity on me with my young nephew and only charged around \u00a350.00 Bear this in mind if you book here and you did so to save money on a hotel as there may be others nearer the centre if you add the taxi fee are a better deal. (if the hotel reads this please sort out a reliable airport pick up and this hotel would be ideal.) During the week the hotel pool is used by local people and the primary school for swimming lessons which I found quirky otherwise it was very quiet through the week. At the weekends however the pool was inundated by locals who book out all the best sunbeds. What no one told us was we had to reserve beds even if hotel guests. I didnt like this and felt reception should have let us know this as they knew it may impact our stay. It worked out ok...just but we were not considered favourably on a Saturday or Sunday and I found this the only let down from the hotel as it could so easily have been managed.

The pizza was yummy and the ice cream.... well, you know Italian ice cream! The thing that most annoyed us was getting to the hotel from the airport. It's not cheap. Unless you decide to use public transport. We ended up getting a bus from outside the airport to Ostia Beach. From there we got a train to Acilia and then a 016 bus from just outside the station to around the corner from our hotel. We did have to ask the bus driver to tell us when we were there and he was very kind. The buses though! Ugh.... they are not frequent at all and some get very packed! To get to the city centre, we found the easiest way was to get the 709 from just outside the hotel to the last stop which is EUR Fermi. That is a metro station and from there you can get into the city. Oh and if you ask the hotel to book you a taxi back to the airport a day in advance, it's cheaper.

We started our holiday by flying to Rome airport with the Italian airline 'Alitalia' who gave us a comfortable flight with free meals and drinks. We were planning on the taxi costing about 30-50 euros which is what many other people had suggested it would cost, only to find the fare was 80 euros instead! We had failed to realise that we wouldn't all fit in one taxi as there were five of us, therefore had to take a minibus back to the hotel. Also there is a 30% charge for after 10pm and for extra luggage. The journey back to the hotel was about 20 minutes and the taxi driver was very friendly. We were met at the reception by friendly staff who were willing to help us and who spoke very good English. We checked in quickly and easily. Our first night was a Saturday and we found it difficult to sleep as the entertainment was very noisy and kept us awake untill past midnight. We didn't need to worry though as this was the only night we had any trouble and on other nights the hotel was very quiet. The public transport was very cheap at 1euro, and this gave you a ticket which lasts 75 minutes which you could use for the metro or the bus. there were also other length tickets however this suited our itinerary most. Once on the bus or metro you must validate the tickets using the yellow machines situated at the front and middle of the bus. The train to Rome was not too busy and quite comfortable, however on the metro around Rome (like any other in a big city) was packed. It is on these trains you have to watch out for pickpockets. The buses, unlike the ones in England have little seats so most people stand. You can get bus tickets from reception or from the shops round the corner. The restaurant at the hotel was not advertised anywhere with no evidence of a menu so our only option was to go down and see for ourselves. The restaurant was very quiet and civilised- and very empty! The meals were expensive at 25 euros for a starter, main dish and pudding and it was a set menu. So we decided to eat at the restaurants next door where you can get pizza and sandwiches and salads for a reasonable price. This restaurant also had the nicest ice cream, the cheapest being only 1.30 euros! Inside this restaurant you can also buy yoghurts and milk and juice to take away so we bought suplies and stored them in the mini bar in the rooms. The other shops nearby are toy shops, clothes shops and one bakery, however most of these shut after about 2pm and don't open untill 4pm and most are closed on Sunday and sometimes Wednesday. Overall these shops are quite usefull and can be used to get small suplies and postcards. However if you want to get proper food from the supermarket this is harder to find as you have to go up the road for about a 15-20 minute walk before you can find one. PAM is the name of this one and sells most things (at an expensive price). When you go into Rome don't waste money on drinks from street sellers, take a water bottle and fill up from the many fountains dotted around the city, which provide you with clean, ice cold water. Toilets in rome and hard to find as we only found two- one by the Vatican and one in the Roman forum. These toilets were generally clean and pleasant. Watch out for beggars in Rome as they can appear from anywhere and are quite scary. the street sellers will rip you off and it's better to buy souveners from shops in the centre. Don't stop to talk to a street seller or he won't leave you alone and one even chased us down the street after asking about his goods! If you are visiting the Colloseam be wary about having your picture taken with the dressed up soldiers there as they charge 5 euros a photo and don't tell you befoe hand. The hotel it's self is very clean and we had clean towels and bedding everyday. The staff were helpfull and polite and the rooms were simple but that was all we wanted. The pool was very clean and of a large size, during the day it was very empty however got more busy at about 4pm. the pool is open during the summer from 9am untill 7pm and the lifeguards are helpfull and friendly. The lifeguards allow you to use inflatables in the pool which was great. The gym however was a disapointment and the lady who was in charge was unhelpfull and didn't understand our English when we asked about volley ball and only gave a ball not explaining that the volleyball net was broken. the gym itself is very quiet with no superviser and no age limits and all the instructions in Italian. The indoor swimming pool had no water in and had no signs up explaining it. the tennis was also a letdown as the courts were there but no balls and no rackets for hire. the only peiople playing were people who had bought there own stuff. Don't try to ask at reception about the sports facilities as they don't have a clue as it seems to be separate from the hotel completely. After the booking we had asked for a extra bed and was surprised to see it was an extra full sized bed not just a camp bed and the price for this was 20 euros per night- a fair price. If you are planning a day on the beach get the bus down to the metro then get the metro to Lido di Ostia where there is are lovely beaches. Most of these beaches however you have to pay to enter and the price is about 6euros per person, however you can then use their shower, change and toilet facilities and play volleyball on site. However if yo wanta public beach you have to walk about a mile down the road untill you find one. This beach is quite busy and you can hire an umbrella for about 4 euros. Overall we enjoyed our stay at Aris Garden Hotel and would definatley come again as it was set in a quite green area and we felt very welcome.

This will determine whether you will really enjoy this hotel. The service is great, but I must say the men are more useful than the women at the desk. Our check-in was quick and efficient (which is rare for anything in Rome) and on top of that we were given complementary breakfasts for our whole stay as there was a mix up with our booking (which was not really their fault in the first place). The facilities avaliable at the hotel are amazing and although you have to pay to use the sun beds, it did not bother us too much as we were always out in Rome. Location: the hotel is about 45 mins outside the city centre and this we found difficult especially at night. It is fine to take public transport but, as the last train/bus ends at midnight it meant we spent alot of money taking taxis back to the hotel. This was a shame as everything else with the hotel is good. However, the free internet, free breakfast, cheap price and the pleasant service made the location bearable. Plus the hotel is only a 20 min bus journey away from Ostia beach which is beautiful and as Rome city centre is very busy it was a nice change to come back to a quieter area. The area where the hotel is located is very posh and safe with a shopping centre right next to the hotel with restaurants and bars to relax in. All in all, a great hotel, with good service. The previous reviews were unnecessarily harsh as this is a very good hotel and the service is good.

The most negative factor has to be its location! - it is in the middle of a small suburb town which is only accessible via a bus. This means ** you take the metro first- the line B (piramide line) towards the direction of laurentina. You must get off at Eur fermi station and take the 709 bus to ascilla or eschillo and walk to the hotel from there which is only about a minute away. Having said this I can say that most other little adversities are very well compensated by the price you pay for the hotel ( quite cheap relative to other hotels in rome). My stay at Aris hotel- \" we did not encounter and insects or mildew or anything else in our very clean bedroom/bathroom which was cleaned by room service every day- that is a big positive!. The lounge downstairs. the free internet access and pool etc are to a very high standard. The reception staff are not the most sociable people nor are they very good communicators- but who cares whether you get a smile or not- plus why would you got to italy to have a decent conversation with the reception staff?? Some good advice would be to use the very nice and relatively cheap pizza/pasta shop in the little shopping centre round the corner from the hotel. Also buy your bus/metro tickets from the Tabbaconist (newsagent) in the shopping centre. Remember to validate these tickets as soon as you get on to the bus-(little yellow machine). Anyway, once you have an idea of how to get to and fro the hotel to the city centre you really dont see it as a negative.

All of the \"normal\" hotel shuttles don't go tho the hotel so we had to take a \"private\" one to the hotel for 50 euros - pretty steep. The hotel had also promised a driver would pick us up, however he was a no show. The hotel it self was just fine. What do you expect from a cheap place? So what if the decorations are tacky? It gets the job done, right? The room was clean and there was no mold or insects in the room. However, do not leave the window open at night with the lights on because of mosquitos.

You can also catch the 709 bus in the opposite direction of the metro, transfer to the #06 (which I call the \"ghetto express\" as it goes through a pretty bad part of the suburbs) and go to the ocean which is absolutely BEAUTIFUL.

The reception staff were very courteous & helpful in all aspects & explained how to make our way to the centre & even provided maps to show how & where we had to make the journey from ( the bus stop is round the corner, you get off at the last stop which is the metro station & the metro stops for all the sites are clearly marked). The bedroom & bathroom were clean & tidy & we had no complaints on that score. Breakfast consisted of breads, croissants, jams, cereals, fruit, cakes with complimentary ham & cheese available on request. Again all very nice. We also ate round the corner in a small restaurant in the shopping complex frequented by locals - this was cheaper than the menu offered by the in house restaurant at night. Although the pool was not available until the 1st June, we laid around it in the garden area which was lovely & quiet. The gym & health club facilities were more than adequate.

The cab ride from Leonardo da Vinci airport was a wild ride that cost 50 euros and even the cab driver had trouble finding the hotel. Upon arrival the reception staff were very disinterested in what was going on, and even had the cheek to ask me to leave my passports at the desk until the morning so that they could photocopy them. I declined his request and told him to copy them straight away as I was not leaving them there. Our room was very spacious and very clean, as after reading other reviews and arriving with trepidation, the first thing I did was check out the bathroom. I wasn't happy with the lock on the door which consisted of a flip over hook and so we pushed chairs up against the door so that at least we would hear if someone was trying to come in. There was no mini bar as advertised, no hotel information books on services, the pool was empty, and like others I never did find the fitness or health centres. The decor was very dated and tacky within the room but the bed was huge and comfortable and the room was serviced well each day with fresh towels. This hotel is ideal if you want somewhere cheap to stay and if you plan to be out all day anyway. It was cheap and perfect if you plan on spending the whole day in Rome and just want somewhere to lay your head at night. I would not recommend it if you were planning on living at your hotel and wanting use of facilities - they just don't exist. It is not hard to get into Rome, go around the corner to the little set of shops and into the tobacconist and ask for a day bus/metro ticket which costs 4 euros and lasts the whole day as opposed to a ticket costing 1 euro that lasts only 75 minutes. Don't forget to validate your ticket as soon as you get on the 709 bus, this is done in the yellow machine on the bus. The bus will take you to Eur Fermi station and from there you can go to the central station of Termini or wherever you need to go. The website is very misleading, the hotel and photos look nothing like the real thing, but I would stay there again for the price, because the room was clean and the fact that we weren't there all day anyway and would buy takeaway pizzas and beer from around the corner and take them back to our room.

The hotel was clean, tidy, everything worked in the room- NO BUGS(but it was March) , Quiet in the Night - breakfast is a Cold Buffet. We flew into Campino Airport and it costs us 35 Euros by a prebooked car for the four of us to get to the Hotel.( about 1/2 hour ) And yes the location is in an area of residental houses but they are big pleasant houses with large gardens We found it more relaxing being away from the centre and more involved with the \"locals\" The 709 Bus from just around the corner goes to Bus Terminal at EUR Fermi about every half hour, this can take anything between 25 minutes and 45 minutes depending on the Italian \"Rush Hour\", From The EUR Fermi Metro station it is about 20 minutes into the Centre . The good thing is that it only costs one Euro all the way. It was an adventure taking the bus (Shame that sometimes it means standing all the way in), The Metro is no so good it gets very crowded as you get close to the Central area, but then anywhere you stay in Rome will mean a Metro ride of Hell - BEWARE the Pick pockets -They really Exist - I had my Pocket \"felt\" on the Metro and My Friend has his wallet stolen on a TRAM ( The Cabinerri said this is one of their favourite places to do Tourists ) AVOID So the hotel is a balance an Hour of travel each way ( admittedly quite crowded on occasions) to save on the big hotel bill .

It was almost impossible to find, arriving by car. The drive from Naples to the Rome ring road took 2 hours. Then it took 3 hours to find the Aris Garden. I called the hotel for directions before leaving Naples. The directions I received were incomplete to the point of misleading. I called twice more during our search, and received more vague instructions from people who really didn't seem to care whether we got there or not. When we finally arrived, we found that the only route from the parking lot to the hotel passed through a construction site which had been turned into a sea of mud by recent rain. Apparently no-one had considered putting down planks for guests to cross - or given the general attitude of the staff, they may have considered it, but couldn't be bothered. The person on reception was civil, but clearly not interested in helping arriving guests beyond handing over the key. The public areas were dingy and grubby. Our room was similar. The hairdryer was broken. There were scuffs and marks on the walls, and fixtures missing from the bathroom. The shower curtain was covered with mildew. Clearly, cleaning and maintenance is a low priority at the Aris Garden. I phoned the front desk for an extra pillow, and was told \"I will try to find one\". When nothing happened in 30 minutes, I called again, and was told \"I told you I will try to find one, but the hotel is full so they are probably all being used\". No pillow ever arrived; nor did we get a call from reception. I find it hard to believe that a hotel has no extra pillows, even when it is full. Given our other interactions with the staff, I think that the effort of locating and delivering the extra pillow was just too great. In summary, the Aris Garden is a sad, grubby, inconvenient, and depressing place, run by people who would much rather be doing something else.

Only two items on menu (sister and I thought food was good for 24 euros vs downtown Rome restaurant not so great meals). Brekfast ok(free). Rides... yes bus/metro takes 35-60 min but everyone, on their own, took the bus (hotel stop is around the corner with nice shops across the street) and then hooked up to frequent metro trains to Termini station and then took bus to spots off metro just for a 4 euro day pass which pays it all.

Bus 709 stops running at around 10:30 10:40pm Daughter missed it and took 15 min to get a 20 Euro taxi ride back from metro. PS no hotel shuttle to metro.. and no night entertainment Friday. They should not advertise those services. Also, airport to Termini(central metro spot) is 10 euros from airport for a 30 min ride(runs every half hr) then another 40 min to hotel by metro/bus... not worth effort in my opinion if two people can share taxi. Trips... Forget vatican museum on Sat (even in Sept) it felt like sardines in the chapel. Read the guide books to do walks.. Good luck finding toilets... They Exist at Colluseum, Vatican, metro (you pay for it), restaurants All in all get out of touristland and try the hotel if you can handle doing a bus and metro. Good luck...

After looking at the hotel on the website, I suppose I should have not built up my hopes too much, seeing as the price was more than reasonable! Hotel Staff were quite helpful but not in a friendly way. And there was certainly no entertainment or nightlife at the hotel, or for miles around. Apart from a coffee bar around the corner that was open until the early hours. Luckily after all the walking around Rome, late nights were not an option. The hotel bar (or should I say shelf) was situated in the restaurant. Unless you sat at one of the tables, then there were 4 wicker chairs to relax on. (For a hotel with 101 rooms!) After extensive walks in the evening, to find an alternative place to eat, other than the Hotel or Coffee Bar, we had come to realise that the hotel is actually situated in the centre of a huge residential area. I also did not see any evidence of the health and beauty treatments on offer, or even a gym. Room As the title of this review suggests, it is more like a worn out Travel Inn back in the UK. Rooms are basic with no ironing facilities. Complementary toiletries comprise of a sachet of 2in1 shampoo/shower gel. Mini Bar is basically a very old fridge under the desk that contains 1 small bottle of still water and 1 small bottle of sparkling. (1.3 euros each). The TV in the room did not pick up any of the advertised UK channels. But as stated on the Hotel website, the windows do actually open??(What\u2019s that all about) However I must comment on the fact that the maid service was excellent. Very clean and fresh bedding and towels each night. Travel The hotel is about 60-90mins from central Rome using the Public Transport, which can be packed tighter than a can of sardines at times. However it is great value! 1euro gets 75mins on the local transport, Bus, Metro and Trams. 4euros buys you a travel card for the entire day. And finally 11euros gets you a 3-day travel card. The hotel shuttle bus was not running during our stay. On the downside, the metro and the bus finish too early to enjoy an evening in Rome.
