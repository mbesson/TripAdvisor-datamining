It's not overwhelming, we just left the bathroom shut. I'm also sure ours was one of the worst since it was a top floor room.

Even though our room was on the first floor and faced the street, we did not really have an issue with noise at night.

The hotel was, also, incredibly well located--we could be at all the main sites within a few minutes of leaving the front door! However, because it is in such a tourist district, you have to walk a bit farther to find less tourist-y restaurants and things to do.

The hotel isn't as glamorous as they make it look. - According to their website, \"this is a residence, which smells history abundantly...\" Really? It certainly smells of something, alright! It's not a completely unpleasant smell, but it definitely has that old-building-with-old-facilities smell (which it probably is). I wished I had brought some air freshener. - Wake up call is utterly unreliable. On our first morning, the wake up call never rang. On the second morning, it was five minutes late. On the third morning--when we were leaving for the airport!!!--it was TWENTY FIVE minutes late. Thankfully, we learned not to rely on it, so we set the alarm on our cell phone. - Power outage at least 2x during our 3-nights stay. I wonder if it's a regular occurrence. - The air conditioning only worked sometimes. - Lastly, weird (and kind of shady) business practice. When we called to make last minute reservations, we were told that they were all booked. But a minute later, upon someone's suggestion, we were able to book via booking.com. We were told that this is a common practice among some hotels in Istanbul. They save some rooms open to hike up the price to someone walking in. (I really hope this isn't true.) The hotel certainly didn't look fully booked during our stay. Okay, it's not all that bad. - Good location. Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, and all the major sites in Sultanahmet are just a few minutes away by foot. (Caveat: it's located in a small street that's kind of deserted and dark at night, so just be extra cautious.) - We got a fantastic view of the Blue Mosque from our room, though I'm sure not all rooms have that view. - The facilities were clean, despite the smell. - The staff was overall very hospitable.

Very deceiving website.\u201d", "Author": "Angelwings256", "ReviewID": "UR105223400", "Content": "Despite its good location just a street away from the Blue Mosque, this hotel is extremely overpriced compared to others and is not accurately described on its website. We first tried to book the cheaper garden suite but they managed to give it to someone else leaving us with no choice but to book a deluxe room at 120 euros a night. We didn't want to pay this much but thought of it as a treat - we were looking forward to the sort of room you see on their website. Unfortunately the photos you see on there are very cleverly taken. There is barely enough room to walk around the bed, let alone put your cases anywhere. We also had no view whatsoever, just walls of other buldings about a metre away from our window - this is despite the website saying all of the rooms look out on to the sea or mosque - make sure you don't get room 204. Although if you strain your neck and look up you might just be able to see a little bit of sky to see if it's sunny or not. The worst flaw of this hotel however is the terrible noise from creaking floors. We expected some as it's an old building but it was beyond ridiculous. We had 3 very interrupted nights' sleep, mostly because the people above somehow managed to walk around their bed for hours at a time at any point in the night and as early as 6am. Don't expect a lie in if the people above are going for breakfast at 7. The creaking wouldn't have been half as bad if the vibrating ceiling from people walking above hadn't rattled the ornate light with every step. It was like kitchen plates being rubbed together constantly as it clanged about and it's not just minor creaking noise, it's full on banging and this from average sized people. It was like a herd of elephants and that's no exaggeration. At 1.30am this isn't what you want from a so called 4 star hotel. We complained but nothing was done, what could be done apart from asking the people to stop walking about at stupid times which didn't seem to be asked of them as we continued to lose sleep. We couldn't even rely on the tv to block out the noise as the signal was so poor and there was only one English channel anyway, BBC World, which you can only watch for so long before it starts repeating itself! We ended up having to catch up on sleep after the people above us had gone out for the day which meant we lost time in the city. Breakfast wasn't great either so we didn't even benefit from this being included in the price. If you wanted a meal in the so called restaurant it wasn't exactly a restaurant but the empty breakfast room. You had to go and find someone at reception to ask for food and I presume they then went and found someone to cook you something. On the positive, the decor is nice and traditional and the bathroom is great. Staff are friendly and rooms were cleaned well. Location is very good. All in all, don't believe anything shown or written on their website - the so called gardens are virtually non-existent and are simply walkthroughs. Again, the photos are very deceiving. This a very small but tall hotel, well decorated throughout but I would never risk having constant interrupted sleep when you only have a few days there, especially when there are equally as attractive places in the same area for a cheaper price.

On the positive side, the hotel provided a great pick up service and is a fantastic location for seeing all the main sights. The hotel is decorated beautifully and the price includes an average buffet breakfast. On the negative side the room we were initially given was tiny and quite tatty. There was no room to leave our cases and there was no room to walk around, as the bed took up 90% of the floor space. At the price we paid for the room and the way the rooms were described on the website we were really disappointed. Also the room was really warm and stuffy. We were willing to put up with the size of the room, but were unable to put up with the heat in the room (air conditioning wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working). We therefore asked to be moved to a different room, which we were eventually able to after two days. The new room was larger, but had an unbearably disgusting smell of drains in the bathroom.

I'm not sure how many stars it is, although its advertised on splendia as 4 star. It definitely doesn't meet the standards of other hotels we've stayed in with this ranking. Our bedlinen had a very large hole in it and the cleaners didn't replace out towels. Also, there was no iron in the bedroom which was inconvenient. Also, it was advertised as having free wi fi but the signal was so weak that it didn't work in our room. We had been staying at another hotel before hand and had called into this hotel a few days before to book a cab to pick us up. We assume that they forgot as the cab never turned up and the man we had booked it from didn't refer to it once we got there. One incident that made us feel unwelcome in particular was that the cleaning ladies were very rude to us. My boyfriend had gone out in the morning time to the local shop and on returning found the two cleaning ladies camped outside our room (It was 11am) saying when were we going to be out of there because they wanted to finish. When you're spending well over \u00c2\u00a3120 a night for a room this behaivour is hardly merited. After about another half an hour, we had a knock on our door, this time it was one of the hotel porters. He wanted to know when we were going out or if we wanted the cleaners. I found this very intrusive and rude. When we left a few minutes later the two ladies scowled at us as we left despite my boyfriend saying thank you and smiling at them. All in all it made us feel very uncomfortable. When we returned, nothing had been properly tidied and the towels and sheets had not been changed.

Also, access to higher floors is by spiral staircase only, so it's obviously not for elderly people to climb. The hotel is very new, and hopefully, with time it will only be getting better. It shows much promise, and has lots of charm.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montb\u00c3\u00a9liard", "Title": "\u201cHotel nice but room not what we expected\u201d", "Author": "berurier", "ReviewID": "UR23045922", "Content": "This hotel is very new, it opened at the end of august. The house is very nice, it's and old Ottoman wooden house which has been repared. The interior is as nice as outside, and all is decored with good taste. Staff is kind and helpfull. breakfast is very good, with fresh juices, choices of things to eat like bread, jam, cheese, jam, eggs, sausages, cakes, good crepes etc... But we had a disapointment. We booked via a site (booking.com). We were supposed to have a large room with large bed (like said in the description of the room I was supposed to have) . In fact we had a very small room (It was dikkicult to walk around, and our cases disturbed us) with a small bed (140 cm). I wanted to go at the reception to protest, but my girlfriend did not want to, as she doesn't not like to protest. Location is very good, in the heart of Sultanahmet. So i think that if you have the chance to get a normal room (not 6 m2 like ours !) with a normal bed, you should have a very good time here.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Erten Konak", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1223257-Reviews-Erten_Konak-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$104 - $331*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "1223257", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/29/cc29ff94aa672dc92a80dfc207e85a154large.jpg"}}
