{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Don't Book This Hotel We booked this hotel through Hostelworld for A$30 a room and paid a deposit. We arrived in Beijing about 8 o'clock at night and followed the instructions to take a bus into the centre of Beijing. The instructions then were to take a taxi. However despite the fact that we had taken the precaution to get the name and address of the hotel written in Chinese, we were not able to find a taxi who would take us. The temperature was about -10\u63b3. Eventually two young women who spoke a little English came to our aid and managed to persuade a taxi driver -- apparently the only one in Beijing with a map - to take us. It took nearly an hour as he kept stopping every five minutes to ask people directions . We went up and down tiny alleys (hutongs) beside the canals lined with karaoke bars and saw a lot of the night life of Beijing which probably most westerners don't see. We eventually found the hotel and paid the taxi driver a huge tip for his efforts. We thought our problems were over. When we went in and presented the agency confirmation sheet, it quickly became obvious they didn't read any English. Or speak it either. And, though it took us nearly 10 minutes to work this out, they had no rooms for us.By this time it was nearly midnight. We were both virtually in tears. All the cheap hotels in Lonely Planet were either not answering or were full. We ended up in the Grands Hyatt at A$200 a night each.Have you ever tried to e-mail Hostelworld with a complaint? Well you can't. My advice is don't use this hotel but more importantly don't use Hostelworld.", "Date": "Apr 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR121242049", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Agnetes"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d651034-r7395720-Hang_Xin_Yuan_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "651034", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
