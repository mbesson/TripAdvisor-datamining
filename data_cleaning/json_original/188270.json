The hotel is across from the main emergency entrance of the hotel. We didn't check out the restaurant or any ammenities,so can't comment on those. The cleaning staff was great, one lady in particular noticed my mom didn't look very good one day & stopped her to see if she was ok, and proceeded to ask her every time she saw her how things were going. I wish I had gotten her name! Anyway, as we are from a small town & thrown into the big city at the worst possible time, it was so nice to see a friendly face once in awhile!

Everything is now lit by the new florescent coil style bulbs which project a harsh light, especially in the bathroom. Some of these bulbs offer a warmer cast, but these tend to be more expensive. I also wish the heater had been quieter. It was just beyond the foot of the bed. I finally turned it off at night so I could sleep in peace. When it ran it was loud and the curtain above it would balloon outward about two feet. The curtain was impossible to pull all the way to the side and keep it there.

We have stayed at some fantastic hotels before and had wonderful service but this \"welcome\" at the awful Park Inn really takes the biscuit. I was so incensed by the hostile welcome of the front desk staff that I actually wrote the review this from our room on the first night of our stay! We arrived after a 300 mile drive to the hotel to find that the rear car park was occupied by an unfortunate homeless man begging for money. Inside the hotel we be greeted by a five minute line up and two members of staff \"serving other customers\". I witnessed very poor customer service while I was waiting to be served and I was amazed at the lack of discretion and sympathy involving another customer in front of me. There was no warmth, empathy or welcome and I thought that this was a very unfriendly hotel. I finally got to the front of the line and a new member of staff came to the desk. I explained that we were staying for 2 nights and that we had made 2 bookings. This seemed to throw the receptionist, who made a big fuss about seeing whether it was possible to retain the same room throughout our two day stay. She eventually agreed and asked for a credit card and photo id. I produced an american express card with my photo on it and was immediately told that this was not sufficient to prove my identity. She abruptly told me that she wanted my driving licence as the photo id on american express wasn't sufficient. She then issued me a key for room on the first floor and sent me on my way. Not a smile. Not a \"How's your day going?\". Not an acknowledgement that she was pleased that we were staying with the Park Inn and Suites. Not a welcome..more a non verbal display of hostility towards customers who were interfering with her day by turning up and asking to be booked in. Turns out that the room was just around the corner from reception and opposite an open fire door leading to the car park, where I had parked my car prior to booking in. The door to our room was wedged open prior to our arrival and we entered to find a scruffy twin room with poor furnishings and antiquated beds. My wife sat on the bed and found that it was in very poor condition. The room was so scruffy that we had to have a good look around to check whether it had been burglarized prior to our arrival. We decided that there was no way that we could stay in that room and I exited thru the open fire door to move our vehicle before we negotiated another room. I secured the fire door as the homeless person was hanging around immediately outside. When I joined my wife at the front desk a third member of staff was dealing with my wife and I arrived just in time to hear the receptionist say, \"If you book with priceline your choice of room is restricted\". Sadly this receptionist also obviously believed that her customers were a major inconvenience in her life because she chose to be abrupt, off hand and rude. At this point I pointed out that the room was sub standard and that it was unlocked. My wife suggested that the homeless man could have easily entered the insecure room and that it was unsatisfactory. Amazingly the receptionist then decided to lecture us that all major cities had problems with homeless people and that we have to put up with it. She then told us that the cleaning staff had a policy of wedging open the firedoors and leaving the hotel room doors open for their own convenience. She seemed to completely miss the point that the safety and security of the hotel and guests should have been a priority for the staff. She finally gave us a better room but only if we paid an extra $20 upgrade fee. Prior to doing this she berated us as she had to change our parking to two days as we hadn't been told that we were staying longer than the initial booking. She was less than pleased when we pointed out that the initial receptionist had been apprised of that fact only five minutes previously. The bottom line is that our second room is perfectly adequate but we feel that the hotel treats its guest as though they are second rate citizens. Okay we are priceline customers but we do stay in hotels at least once a week on average. This place has been completely let down by three members of their front desk. All of them need to understand that customer service is paramount and that priceline customers do exchange information with their peers!", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BC", "Title": "\u201cgood experience\u201d", "Author": "gottagetoutofhereBc", "ReviewID": "UR121210840", "Content": "Good experience, friendly staff, $148 tax incl with breakfast for two and free parking.

They don't nickle & dime you here. Parking is cheap and Wifi is free, The staff are friendly and helpful. They offered great advice about exploring this neighborhood and about the easy transportation options nearby. Pay the small surcharge for the city view rooms.

The big problem with this hotel is the noise - although the view from the rooms on the street side is spectacular across Vancouver to the mountains beyond, there must have been a big gap or a vent somewhere around the window, because although the window was closed, the busy street outside was very loud - I would recommend requesting a room on the back side of the building if you want a quiet night's sleep - but even with a room at the back, you will still have the problem of a large gap at the bottom of the door, which means you can hear everything going on in the corridor that runs along the centre of each floor.

We paid $160/night - which I thought was pricey for what you got.", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cRoom OK, rude staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4161099", "Content": "I stayed at the Ramada on Broadway in late November while I was in town to get laser surgery on my eyes. This was the closest hotel to the clinic and at $85/night seemed a reasonable option. I won't be back. The room was nicely furnished but very cold and the thermostat didn't work at all. The lobby is being renovated and the way to the elevators is through an open construction zone which was inconvenient and the rude desk staff didn't offer directions until prompted. They asked for picture ID upon check-in, which I produced and it was promptly whisked away and photocopied. The copy was stapled to my registration card. I indicated that I expected to get that back upon check-out and was told that that was not going to happen. When I did check out, the same surly woman refused to give the woman in line ahead of me her photocopied drivers license and the woman simply left unhappy. I asked for mine, was refused, and so I ripped it off my registration card. The clerk YELLED for the manager. The manager said she wasn't going to physically force me to give it back (!) but that I would be expected to comply with this policy if I stayed there again. Well of course I'm not staying there again. Copies of my identification don't belong in the hands of third-rate hotel clerks, or in anybody else's hands. I was told the policy was particular to this Ramada and not Ramada-wide, and that it originally had something to do with the war on terrorism. Oh brother. I felt like I was staying in a welfare flophouse. Maybe I was, maybe that's the market Ramada's after.", "Date": "December 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto, ont", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "nanaimobum", "ReviewID": "UR4130105", "Content": "My mom and I stayed here for four nights in mid November.

The restaurant and room sevice were very good and staff very friendly. There are plenty of other food outlets nearby so you have plenty of choices of where and what to eat.
