The neighborhood of Prenzlauerberg was a fantastic base from which to see Berlin, with unique shops and cafes throughout the area. Berlin is a large city and no matter where you stay you will likely need to use public transit to see what you want to see. We bought a week transit pass and used it each day to explore neighborhoods in east and west Berlin. The tram is right next to the hotel and the U2 subway, one of the main lines, is a few blocks away, and there is never more than a few minutes' wait for public transit.

We chose this hotel cause looked very pretty on the picture and because of the area..still city center, nice and quiet, convenitently located to all the rest of the city thanks to the U Bahn. What Ackselhaun mostly features is a one of a kind structure that doesn't give it the proper feeling of a hotel but more like apartments. So if you don't like the \"hotel\" life it is the perfect place. You enter in a lobby (non operation 24h but they were so nice to wait our arrival by 23.30) and then you get into a beautiful garden that brings you to some rooms on garden floor and then up with the elevator to other rooms. It is very quiet and perfect if you want relax. It is conveniently located 5 min walk from the U Bahn (senefelder strasse) and if you like something to eat or drink, very closeby there is kastanienallee full of pubs, fast food, cozy restaurant and typical nice stores. We decided not to have breakfast included cause the price of 25 euro per person looked too much. But don't worry: walking through Kollowitzstrasse you'll find a lot of cafes. If i may suggest Anna Blume is one of the most delicious. Also another good place right close to the U bahn stop (senefelder strasse) is LPG Biomarkt. it is a biological supermarket that has also a cafeteria where prepare coffee and pastries. it is a cheap and fast solution.. Talking about the rooms, i admit they're stunning. We stayed in the one called honeymoon. It is more an apatment than a room.. There was a kitchen, a bathroom, a big bedroom and a second room with a comfortable sofa and a drawer. the theme of the apartment was the honeymoon so it was fully of romantic details: from the curtains to seclude the bed area by the rets of the room, to the lamps, the flower theme wallpaper.

Firstly, the area itself is THE place to be, not because it is trendy, relaxed, bohemian, arty, live music streaming most places, alternative, classy, relaxed, organic haven - yes it is all those things, but more so because it has such an amazing ambience. One can spend literally days just in Prinzlauer Berg and surrounds.

Pre and post booking service was great. We were offered a last minute cancellation on a 2bdr apartment at the same price as the double room(s) we were after that were booked out.

Fish tanks inserted into the walls, lovely buffet breakfast, with fresh bread for you to pick put in your cane basket and take outside to sit in the sun, blanckets cushions and cane chairs, with great attentive service. The highlight, particularly on a sunny May long weekend, has to be the lovely gardens that both Ackselhaus and Blue Home offer their guests. It is a tranquil paradise, and the photos on the hotel's website are a true reflection of reality. We bought beautiful fresh produce at Kollwilplatz open air markets on Saturday (a must experience) and had an alfresco long lunch with friends who dropped in to see us.

If you are after touristy trip, dont worry, we walked to Alexanderplatz no probs, but you can catch a tram that is 50m from the hotel, 3 stops and you are there.

The only minuses were the pretty small bathroom and the very squeaky bedframe (which could deprive couples of their sleep). The breakfast in the morning was very tasty with a good variety of rolls, bread, cold cuts, cheese, cereal, fresh fruit, and boiled eggs, served by a cheerful young Australian lady. The Ackselhaus is a great base for exploring the East side of Berlin, providing a homey atmosphere and not an anonymous hotel experience that you would find elsewhere.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cLoved the hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Nitina", "ReviewID": "UR8451872", "Content": "Me and my partner stayed here in June 2007 for a week and we loved it. We stayed in of the apartments in the main hotel (Ackelhaus) and it was very spacious and very nicely decorated. The neighborhood around is very pretty and it's also quiet, no street noise. We found the staff to be very friendly and although we chose not to pay for breakfast, there is a small supermarket just on the corner called 'Netto' and we bought breakfast for the whole week. Food in Berlin is so cheap. The location is excellent. It is very close to the city centre and all the sights. There is a tram stop 1 min walk from the hotel that takes you straight to Alexanderplatz and takes about 5 mins. From there you can take any metro to go to different parts of Berlin. Also there is a metro stop near the hotel that takes about 10 mins walk. The location makes it very convenient for transport. The neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg in East Berlin is so nice! There are many nice cafes, restaurants etc and it's not touristy either. The architecture was very pretty and interesting, we found it nicer than other parts of Berlin. I would highly recommend staying in East Berlin as your base when you visit, the west is more commercialised and the buildings look like any other European city. If I go back to Berlin I will definitely stay in this area again and in this hotel.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "zagat", "ReviewID": "UR8035646", "Content": "I stayed in the Blue Home, in a wonderful room overlooking the street.

On cold days the room was nicely warm (in March). half a block away is another gem, Luso - a Portugese restaurant with very fine and friendly service and most tasty grilled fresh fish, and green wine.

I had not visited this part of Berlin before. However the flat in which I stayed which was well furnished and decorated got too little daylight to the main sleeping and living area. Opening a blind which kept light out, one realized that this room was on the same level as and directly next to a roof area, hence the shut heavy blind. On one occasion, there was a person looking directly from the roof area into my main room (lack of privacy, if blind not shut keeping light out). Stairs led up from the main courtyard to the roof area where sheets were hung later. Seeing me in my room, an embarrassed person seemed to scuttle away back down from whence he had come, the stairs from the communal courtyard area. Also, the advertised wireless-LAN acessibility anywhere in the ackselhouse seemed not operate at the desk of my flat (Reception confirmed that in one flat wireless-LAN did not work; I had to go into the communal courtyard in the dark). Perhaps what I got was a flat cheap at 95 Euros a night (without breakfast). When I booked over the telephone asking for a room for one person, I should have checked better what I was getting. And if I had been told that I was not getting a single room or a double room at single rate but a flat cheap because it had no wireless-LAN access and lack of light or privacy, I would not have stayed there.", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cI love this hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3524061", "Content": "We stayed in the apartments last year and thought they were great.
