I have stayed in Hawaii many times and really think it is worth spending a bit more and staying at a hotel other than the \"Grand\". As each room is individually owned you can never be sure of the facilities. The room is only serviced every 3-4 days and they don't even renew the soap or shampoo even though I was there for a week.

I wanted to word it a bit differently. To start, the Castle Waikiki Grand isn't a traditional hotel. The studios, one + bedrooms, and suites are privately owned condominiums. At least most of them are anyway. The decor, the appliances, and the furnishings in the rooms are the sole responsibility of the condo owner. Therefore some rooms are going to be nicer than others. I had a room on the 6th floor, that overlooked the Honolulu zoo. The property is directly across the street from the zoo. However there were no weird odors or loud noises. In the mornings I would sit on the lanai and watch the peach colored flamingos walk around. From the lanai, I had a fantastic view of Diamond Head and the ocean. To the east there was Diamond Head, and to the west was the ocean. I couldn't have asked for a better view. In the mornings and the evenings, watching the sun rise and set from the lanai was absolutely beautiful. My studio had been renovated like a year before, and it was very nice. I did not see one creepy crawler in my room. It was clean, roomy, had fairly new furnishings, had a decent sized lanai, a queen sized bed, a full kitchen (no oven), dishes, utensils, pots and pans, microwave, a full sized fridge, 25 inch flat screen television with cable. The kitchen counters were granite top, the bathroom was clean and nicely done., I paid around $100/night. I went to the local grocery store (I rented a car), and I prepared most of my breakfast and dinner meals in the room and had my meals on the lanai as I watched the various people walking by and the flamingos roam around their area at the zoo. Granted, it did get a little noisy at night, but the noise didn't go on all through the night. The building has a burger joint on the lobby floor, and an alternative bar on the 2nd floor, mainly for men, but this was not a problem. I was there alone for 5 days and did not have a problem coming or going. I did not see, or experience anything weird while I was there. Sure the building could probably use a paint job, but it certainly is in decent shape. There is also parking provided for a fee. As this is moreso like an Extended Stay type of hotel, maid service is not available everyday unless you pay a nominal fee. If I am not mistaken, after 5 days maid service is provided at no charge. In my opinion, if you want to save money, this is the way to go. Just be sure to inquire about the room prior to booking. Ask about the decor, and the condo owner in general. However, if you're one of those who like to stay at overpriced hotel chains and pay a ridiculous nightly rate just for the sake of saying that you did, be my guest. Sure, you get a few more perks with these higher priced chain hotels, but in my opinion, the extra that you're paying could be used for something else. Think about it, when you're on business or vacation, how much time do you actually spend in the room anyway? I like the Castle Waikiki Grand, I'm considering going back before the year is out.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value and Fantastic Views!\u201d", "Author": "jojowego", "ReviewID": "UR118785509", "Content": "I am very surprised at the amount of negative reviews of the Waikiki Grand Hotel, as I stayed there for a week and had a great room on the 6th floor with TWO private lanais.

They never once smiled. They seem to go out of their way to avoid eye contact with anyone entering the lobby, exiting from the elevator to the lobby, etc. They only look up if you stand at the counter. Wifi keep dropping service so ended up having tp go to Starbucks to send emails. First moring, I brought back a cup of coffee and a bagel from the Starbucks and sat in the lobby and as I began to place spread on my bagel, a man with a dustpan full of cigarette butts told me I had to leave as there is no eating or drinking in the lobby! I said that I was aguest in the hotel. He pointed to an obsecured sign and said \"no food or drinks\" you must go! I was shocked that i had to leave the lobby! The man stared at me untill I got into the elevator to go up to my room. The room was in great disrepair. The deadbolt did not latch but the worst was the A/C unit that sounded like a Boeing aircraft engine even on low.

I placed my shirt on the flat bedspread to make due and yep, you guessed it, stained my shirt as the irons sole plate was so filthy, it transfered onto my shirt.

Honolulu is FULL of expensive hotels that are nice, as nice as any downtown Hilton or Marriott or Hyatt Regency but no more. Honolulu also has its helping of laughably silly expensive hotels that have opulent lobbies, overpriced restaurants and pool terraces with guards to keep out the rifraff. The Castle Waikiki Grand Hotel is none of these. Its pool is not worth the trouble, it is behind the hotel and ground level and surrounded by tall buildings so it gets no sun, no big deal, you dont need the pool. The Grand has no restaurant or hair salon or gift shop. It does house Honolulu's biggest and best gay bar as well as a GLBT clothing/trinket shop. What the Grand has is an awesome spot at the end of Waikiki Beach, less than one block from the sand and one entire side of the hotel and the front has a view of the ocean and the extensive Honolulu Zoo and surrounding lush parkland. You wont get a view like this anywhere else except maybe at the Parc Hotel next door. This place is a mix of owned/rented small studio condo units that are lived in and hotel rooms. The rooms are small but clean. This building is old and in same cases looks like it needs some paint here or there. The lanais are perfect for all day sun and I mean from 7am-5:30p, nothing gets in the way of the sun since there are no more tall buildings across from the hotel. There is high speed wireless internet that worked fine and cable TV with medium sized LCD TVs- I stayed in two rooms, both had nice TVs. Both rooms I was in had refrigerators and microwave ovens, one did have a 2 burner mini stove and sink, the other one did not. All rooms have A/C which you will need if the day is sunny. Dont count on quiet in Honolulu, there is always street noise but my room on the 9th floor was much quieter than the one on the 4th floor. The front desk closes at 10p so dont find yourself needing something after that! The Grand is within walking distance of all of Waikiki shopping and dining, its just right around the corner in either direction. For quick food there is a Teddy's Bigger Burger right downstairs, its a Hawaii based burger chain. Starbucks is next door, McDonalds, Subway and Burger King are minutes away. The International Marketplace is about 10 minutes walk and there is a pretty amazing food court with every kind of Asian food you can imagine from Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Korean, sea food of every kind and, well, much more. In addition Lu Lu's is a nice place with lots of fresh sea food and salads right next door. The Aston has a nice terrace restaurant around the corner and a liitle further down is the main shopping area where you can find such appalling restaurants as The Cheesecake Factory, Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville and Cheeseburger in Paradise- I always say that there is nothing better after a hot day in the sun than a big creamy slab of cheesecake! Anyway, chooses the Grand for a great value and a great location and you wont even notice that the room doors like like they may be about 40 years old!", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, Nebraska", "Title": "\u201cHands down, best for your buck!\u201d", "Author": "corylong", "ReviewID": "UR89616714", "Content": "I was slightly nervous based on reviews about what I would walk into.

We were a little concerned that we got the room for $53/night but we figured we could spend the money we saved on other things. When we got to the hotel it was in a very sketchy part of Waikiki (near the zoo). The guy at the front desk was not very friendly. We were assigned room 804. We knew before hand after reading some reviews that we would ask for a different room if we were not happy. We went up to the 8th floor and it looked like a run-down apartment building. In the room was a tiny double bed (supposed to be a queen). The bedspread was old and worn with holes in it. The ceiling was falling to pieces, the drapes were tattered, the carpet was disgusting, the furnishings were old, the tub was grungy and looked like it hadnt been cleaned in years, the fixtures were falling off and the room smelled like death. The clincher for us was the couch and stools in the room which were covered in BLOOD and \"other bodily fluids\" everywhere. We went back downstairs and told the desk clerk that there was no way we were sleeping in that room. He huffed and made i seem like we were being unreasonable in asking for another room. He gave us room 822 and said that was the only other room that was avaialble. We went back up to the 8th floor into the new room. This room was slightly better but not by much. It had a king bed with and old soiled mattress, the carpets were just as gross and the curtains had the same blood and \"body fluid\" stains as the frst room. The room was musty and the A/C didnt work. The room looked over the inner courtyard area which is surrounded in low income housing with some very unsavoury looking tenants. The only upside (if there is one) is that it had a flat screen tv. The window locks barely worked. By this time it was very late and we were tired from a long day of travel so we decided to stay the night and get another hotel in the morning. In the middle of the night the bed crashed through the frame and onto the floor. The noise from outside was very loud with crazies and druggies shouting at all hours of the night. I was itching all night and barely slept. We were up and checking out of that place at 6am. The new guy at the front desk made no effort to correct our stay nor did he apologize for the condition of the room. The only thing he said to us was to contact Priceline about a refund. It seems like they are well aware that this hotel is disgusting. We aren't usually picky when it comes to our accomodations but this is by far the worst place we have ever stayed. We went to the hotel a few doors down to use their internet access to book a room at the Hilton Hawaiian Village which was absolutely amazing! Do not stay here, spend the extra money and book a nice hotel, it saved our trip thats for sure.

It's definitely not luxurious or even a 4 star hotel, but I felt it was clean (no bugs or other creatures, which was a big plus to me) and fairly large/comfortable (after we upgraded to a suite). The very best thing about the hotel is the view, especially from the 10th floor, which was where our room was located. Our first room (#501) was tiny, almost claustrophobic - especially for 2people (we would have been miserable there). So we decided to upgrade to a suite (#1009) and had much more room, incl 2 bathrooms - one for each of us. My favorite thing to do was relaxing out on the lanai while looking at the ocean or Diamond Head; there was usually a nice breeze, and it was lovely (except when the construction started at 6am at two sites across the street, the Zoo and a nearby hotel). We had several problems w/our stay -- incl no free Wi-Fi or internet access in the room, even though it was advertised; having to change our parking space every day; and the curtains in the room were in shreds making it impossible to open them to allow the breeze to flow thru. When we reported these issues to Jason, the manager, he was very helpful, deleting the parking charges and cost of room upgrade from our bill, and refunding my friend's charges for accessing Wi-Fi. All in all, if a lovely view/proximity to beach/cleanliness are important to you and you don't need free Wi-Fi/internet access or all the little amenities you get at a nicer hotel, then I'd recommend this hotel.

The deck was shared and there were constantly people stroling up and looking in our room. One person even asked how we got the room and how much we paid. It was very weird.

The were cheap and dinjy. Most of the windows didn't work properly or wouldn't open and the AC was not enough to cool the room. There were no closets but had a good size wardrobe cabinet. The doors were held shut by toilet paper shoved in the middle. Noise was aweful and construction next door started at 6:00am. They promised free WiFi and there was none. On top of that the staff didn't know anything about that service. I got a lot of \"I don't knows\" Even pluging into the roughter didn't work. I had to pay for an outside internet service that my wifi found. Parking was a nightmare. We had to change parking spaces 5 times in the 4 days we were there.

When owners are not using their units themselves, they can rent them through the Hotel service or through private management companies. I have stayed many times in the past 5yrs at this property, I have been to Hawaii 23 times. I can tell you from first hand experience, it all depends on who you rent from, whether or not you will have a good or bad experience. Let me explain. I have found the best units in the building are the ones managed by anyone other than Queens Surf!!! I recently stayed in unit 918, for 22 nights and it by far is the best most well maintained unit that I have had the chance to experience. Many times I have rented from Queens Surf vacation rentals and the majority of reviews I have read on this web sight are things that I have experienced as well. However, just to let people know, this is a great location in Waikiki, it is in the heart of everything, you can stay here with or without a car, just out the front of the building is all sorts of options for transportation, from taxi's to the major routes for the bus systems to shuttle services. As far as the hotel, you just have to do your research, you can find great units here, just don't limit yourself to only one option for the condo units. Google, Waikiki Grand, or look for other rental services at the Grand, you can find better and more reasonable units in this great quaint condotel property. I would suggest trying units 302,319,605 or 918. I have seen and inspected all of these particular units and they are of the best quality in this building and the most well maintained for cleanliness and well appointed with every amenity needed for your stay while in Hawaii. In the basement of the building there is also a laundry facility that is available 24hrs a day. This is very accommodating, now that the airlines are restricting the amount of luggage you can check free of charge. I truely hope this review will assist you in making your trip to Paradise a very enjoyable one. I have to say that I am a very picky traveler, I have a degree in the hospitality and airline career industry. I have worked many years in the business of travel myself and know what to expect for the value of my travel dollar. My only suggestion is once again, do your homework and research and I am sure you will enjoy your stay at \"THE WAIKIKI GRAND\"!!!!!

Previous reviews of the Waikiki Grand highlight the importance of researching your accommodation to have a realistic expectation of what to expect. We spent 6 nights at the Waikiki Grand Hotel - I looked around and it was the best deal we could find for our budget (Originally I wanted to stay at the Royal Grove Hotel, but it was sold out). We were strictly trying to stay to a $100 per night limit. A few things to help anyone thinking of staying here..... Yes, there is a gay bar! But who cares really - you don't have to go if you don't want to. Some people are still very ignorant to the gay community - it's not like they are going to chase you down and convert you! In this day and age people really need to 'get over it'. Yes, there is noise - especially the garbage trucks! It happened twice during our stay. But hey - its $95 per night with housekeeping included! It's also Waikiki! Things happen at night here with people coming back from the nightclubs etc - stay outside of Waikiki if you can't handle the noise! Yes, the rooms are small. The carpet was very badly stained (we were in room 620) and the kitchen and bathroom was very small. But as I said before, we were using the room only to sleep and shower - it was clean and that's the important thing. However, as a note to Management the carpet needs to be replaced in this room as it is a bit of a joke, but not 'un-liveable'. If you are a young couple (of any sexual orientation) who would like some privacy and stay somewhere which is a few steps up from a hostel, this is the place for you! If you are older, have kids, don't like noise stay somewhere else and fork out the money for what you want!!!

There is a \"GAY\" bar in the hotel, it didnt bother me being a girl, but my boyfriend found it a little uncomfortable when he heard some discussions outside the lobby. NOT SO APPROPRIATE!

Also, the full kitchen *minus the oven* was perfect and we saved a ton of $$$ on food. That is a HUGE recommendation! A lanai and a kitchen! The hotel was obviously built a while back and you can tell with the elevators and the plumbing, but those were small things we worked around and didn't let it bother us. The staff were nice. I wouldn't say they were the best, but they were informative. It would have been good if the staff greeted you with a hello once and a while. We have decided never to stay here again, because it is just too small for 2 people and 5 suitcases. But I would say we never had any SERIOUS problems with our stay!

Each of the studio condo units are privately owned, therefore, they reflect the owner's personality and style...which I find refreshing! No cookie cutter rooms here! And many of them come complete with kitchenettes, which is another great added bonus! They are also planning upgrades to the building in the near future....so it's only going to get better and better! You can't beat the rates, either!

Waikiki was booked and no hotel rooms were available. Since our favorite hotels were full, we booked 2 nights through a travel engine on the internet . Never staying at the Waikiki Grand Hotel, we didn't know what to expect. I called ahead to alert them that we were going to arrive late in the evening. When we got there, we were confused by the Private Parking signs under the hotel, but parked anyway thinking it was for hotel guests. Out of the elevator the 3 of us adults came (me+hubby+daughter), only to see the Front Desk clerk say goodbye to the Security Guard, even tho she sees us arriving. We were greeted by the Security Guard with a, \"Driver's license, please.\" Where's the aloha in that? Then we asked if we could park downstairs. He put the fear of God in us and said to move it immediately if you don't want your car to be towed away. We had to park across at the zoo or 5 blocks away. We ended up in the latter. Now it's 10:30p and we go up to the room where there's only a king bed ... for 3 adults? Hmmm, let's go back to the Front Desk. I explain the situation, he puts up both hands and says he can't do anything because he's only a security guard and he doesn't work for the hotel. There's also no manager until 9 am the next morning. By this time, steam hits the top of my head and I find myself yelling at the guard. All of a sudden he gets a brilliant idea to check the computer and call the FD clerk that left earlier. Luckily there was one more room that might be empty and daughter could sleep there until other accommodations could be made in the morning. To make a long story short, we got another room with a less than acceptable futon and double bed for the next night - hardly worth the money I was paying for. The parking nightmare never ended because the zoo, as well as other parking structures, were always full . No manager ever contacted us to make amends which goes to prove that there was no aloha extended at the Waikiki Grand Hotel. Don't stay there.

It had breathtaking views of the Ocean and Diamond head. It is the last building near the corner of Kalakaua and Kapahulu, so you have an unobstructed view from your bed and lanai overlooking the lush greenness of Kapiolani park and you can have a beautiful view of the beach from this room. I can't say enough about this view because it has to be one of the best in Waikiki. The beach across the street is Queen's surf beach and the city has just completed new landscaping and paving so there is a beautiful new promenade to walk along . Also on weekends they have Free movies on the beach there. They set up a 50 foot screen and everyone gathers on the beach and buys food from the stands located temporarily for the show. You can even watch the movies from the Lanai of the room I was in. The 24 hour fitness facility is just around the corner on Kalakaua. So entertainment, shopping, movies, botanic gardens, aquarium, zoo are all within a 15 minute walk! There is a Denny's and Starbuck's on the corner, it is also where the bus from the airport stops. The Lyon Arboretum and its rainforest palm collection is a 5 minute bus ride away. You can stay at the Queens surf and have no need for a car rental. But if you do want to rent a car and explore the other parts of this beautiful island, there is parking underground here. That is very important because parking spaces are very rare in Waikiki and so it is difficult to find a space if it isn't provided and they ticket and tow readily in Waikiki. The Queens surf is a vacation rentals type of lodging.. These units are in the Waikiki Grand hotel and vary in size, view and price.

The view from you balcony of Diamond Head every morning as you have coffee and the view of the surfers returning to their cars in the evening is well worth the small difference in price from the city view room. The imaculately clean and white studio we had (#414) was perfect with a tidy kitchenette with every possible item of utensils, dinnerware and cookware...plus a coffee pot and microwave and fridge. We do agree with the earlier review that there is some noise from the elevator, but that happens in any hotel. We requested, and received promptly from the front desk, a small fan which we turned on at night to mask outside noise. It worked perfectly and our sleep in the very comfortable bed was undisturbed until the sun started streaming in the next morning. Hulas, the largest gay bar in town, was on the second floor but the music from the club never disturbed us. In fact, we could not hear it even when we were on the balcony. And it was very convenient to pop in for a drink or a cruise whenever we wished. Queens' Surf beach is a 5-minute walk away and the execellent and very-gay-friendly W Hotel bar is a 10-minute walk. Situated on the far East end of the the main drag in Waikiki, the property is out of the press of the main tourist trade. Whenever you are ready to head to the beach, the front desk hands out large towels and beach chairs. They are yours for the day free of charge. There is also a large and recently renovated coin laundry room in the basement with new washers and dryers that have digital timers, plus a large flat-screen TV to help pass the time. This property was the perfect place to relax, play, or just enjoy the best of the beach and the city. We will be back every February for at least a week.", "Date": "March 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't recommend\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1546736", "Content": "This is a great location and the price is good.
