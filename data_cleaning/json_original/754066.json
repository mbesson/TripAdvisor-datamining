{"Reviews": [{"Content": "HSH, just right for us I selected this hotel after spending a good deal of time on the internet checking many hotels and their locations.HSH is well located in Mitte, only 100 yards from Zinnowitzerstrasse UBahn and about 10 minutes walk to the Hauptbanhof, the main railway station. Trams and buses are also available outside the hotelIt is an easy walk to Oranienbuger Strasse where there are many restaurants , bars and entertainments. A bit further on takes you down to Friedrichstrasse and the must-see which is Checkpoint Charlie. There are many sights to see in Berlin and the contrast between the west and east of the city is very marked. I would recommend taking a river boat trip along the Spree , it is most interesting and informative. Another great way to learn about Berlin is to go up the TV Tower in Alexanderplatz. Be sure to pay the extra 3 Euro for the Audio guide as they take you round the 19 viewing points of the city and explain the history of the buildings and areas throughout Berlin. The views are excellent as the viewing area is on the round and is over 600 feet up.We had a junior suite at HSH and it was large and very well appointed with a kitchen with fridge and dishwasher. It also had a large balcony overlooking a garden area and it was very quiet.Breakfast was very good with a good variety of breads, meats and even smoked salmon and fresh fruit. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and they spoke good English.I would certainly go back to HSH when visiting Berlin.", "Date": "Sep 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR739934781", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "F0rest"}, {"Content": "Excellent value We have just returned from a 3 night stay in this hotel. Having an apartment with a separate room for our 22 year old daughter was very economical compared to some of the hotels we have stayed in before.The hotel is very convenient to the underground rail system and 15.60 euro covered a full days transport for 5 people in zones AB C.All in all a good choice, our only complaint being the fact that the hotel must be close to an emergency station as several times our sleep was broken by sirens from emergency vehicles passing in front of the hotel. This being the case I would ask for a room facing the courtyard the next time rather than one facing the street.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR208026862", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "hxdirect"}, {"Content": "a great place to stay in the heart of Berlin I will definitely recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. With the price, we surprised to get a lot unexpected accommodations - excellent complementary breakfast buffet, laundry room with three washers and three dryers that are free for guests, two computers with internet, very modern gym room, sauna, bike service, large TV with DVD player, large and very clean bathroom.... I will definitely come back. The front desk service could use some improvement. They should find a way to control the use of two computers by some school children who occupied the computers and played the games for a long time....", "Date": "Oct 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR489608196", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Heidan"}, {"Content": "all the home comforts in a good location       sitting area", "Date": "Oct 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR603463943", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "hrcnow"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d754066-r20218025-HSH_Hotel_Apartments_Mitte-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "754066", "Price": "$248"}}
