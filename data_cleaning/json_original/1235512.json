When I said that I have not, they arranged someone to go up to my room with me. The guest officer told me about the facilities in the hotel and offered to show me the features of the room. I thought that was a very nice touch! The room was quite big, with mirrors all around. The bathroom can be seen from the room as it was a glass wall. It was quite nice to be able to lie in the bathtub and soak away while watching TV. The bed was comfortable and clean, but the pillows were a bit too soft for my liking as I prefer harder pillows. Everything was in order, the shower facilities, the view of Orchard, the many TV programmes... We went up to the gym on the 12th floor too. The gym is well equipped enough, the pool is a little small, but has a nice view. The sauna can only seat 4 people and the steam bath was out of order, hence we did not get to try those as the sauna was already packed. We had a simple breakfast too. Nothing amazing, just a simple spread of bread, coffee, tea, milk, cereals, some salad and fruits, the usual eggs, sausages etc. One thing I liked was the nice touch of putting an umbrella in the room's cupboard. As Singapore has very unpredictable weather, the umbrella shows the hotel's thoughtfulness. Worth a stay as it was only 5 - 10mins walk away from major shopping and the experience there was great. :)", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cAn Traquil oasis in centre of town\u201d", "Author": "CSom", "ReviewID": "UR127983809", "Content": "located just 5 mins walk from the famed Orchard Road in Singapore, Quincy is an unique full-board hotel in town.

Free use of nespresso machine & complimentary minibar (2 cans of soda, 2 beer, 3 bottles of mineral water, 2 pieces energy bar, Lays chips, instant coffee & tea). Very comfortable bed & pillows. The free Wifi was great throughout the hotel. Hope they will add more choices in their breakfast buffet. We ate dinner there and my husband loved their steak. I liked my sweet & sour shrimp with rice and their soft ice cream - delicious. The hotel is around 10mins away from the nearest Orchard MRT station. Lucky Plaza was just around the corner of Orchard Rd and this is where we had our money exchanged. A bit of a walk when returning to the hotel if you are carrying a lot of your purchases.

I had breakfast the first morning and didn't return for another meal in spite of the fact that the three meals are included. The food was very basic and choices limited. Beans out of a can, lowest quality bread, etc. Obviously skimping on the food to make money. I will probably go back but if I want a decent breakfast I'll book the Hilton next time.

I returned from a full day of work and took a quick swim in the small (but very nice) pool to wake me up, showered, changed, had a fresh Tiger beer on tap at the (again free) cocktail hour (6-8pm) before going out to a business meeting.

When I told reception the next morning they instantly offered me another room. I should point out that the air conditioning in the new room wasn\u2019t exactly arctic-like. It certainly made the room quite comfortable, but if you like your room to be like a fridge (it is Singapore after all) then you might be disappointed. The free meals are a good bonus. We had breakfast most days but only had dinner a couple of times, mainly for convenience. On one evening my wife and I were in a bit of a rush heading out to a show. We asked the waiter at dinner to serve us whatever on the menu was the quickest to make. He suggested one dish, but also offered to make another dish, which wasn\u2019t on the menu. Both dishes arrived very quickly and we made the show.

I have to admit that this experience was in one word 'Awesome'.Let me start from the beginning: Reached Singapore in the morning by Singapore Airlines at 07.30 am (half an hour before schedule). Breezed through Immigration and Customs ( I had 2 packet of Cigarettes with me and hence went to the Red Channel with intent to declare and pay duty, if required). However, the officer just waved me on through the Green Channel even while I was showing him the packets. Good start to the day. At the exit there was this gentleman standing with my name on a Board and in a short while we were on our way in the Mercedes (Complimentary Limousine Pick up arranged by the Hotel) and reached the Quincy in 30 minutes at 8.45 am. The nice little Front Office girl Alicia checked me in and explained to me the policy of early check in for which you had to pay SGD 20/- per hour (they had mentioned this in the mail in response to my query so no surprises there). She offered to store my luggage and requested me to come back at 12.00(Official check in time is 14.00 hours). Walked to the MRT station Orchard Road ( walk took 10 mins. to Paragon on Orchard Road and another 5 mins. to the MRT). Went to Mohd. Moustafa on Farrer Park for some shopping of Toiletries and Chocolates(only place open 24 hours and prices the cheapest in Singapore). Returned at 12 and Room was ready. However, since I did not want a Room on the 11th Floor due to the reported noise of the Swimming Pool pumps mentioned by a Trip Advisor member so she suggested I have lunch in the meantime while some other Rooms get vacated. Had a lovely lunch of Seafood Fried Rice and then soft serve vanilla ice cream with Chocolate Sauce and was in my Room 1003 on the 10th Floor by 13.00 hours. Rooms : The Rooms are not too large but cleverly designed with lots of Glass to make it look much bigger. Very comfortable King Bed and huge Bathroom with those lovely Molten Brown Toiletries(shampoo,soap,body lotion,shower and bath gel), shaving kit, Toothbrush,comb, cotton buds set Huge French Window with a lovely view of Buildings around with electronically operated curtains to black out the light completely. Complimentary 3/4 bottles of Water ( no hassles of puchasing water and lugging it from the Grocery to your Room) which is replenished daily as are the toiletries and Mini Bar items(Lays, Beer,soft drinks,cup noodles etc.) and coffee/tea/sugar sachets. Hair Dryer, shoe polish, bedroom slippers, Dressing Robe and safe all in the Room. A long working desk and Chair with free internet and multiple plug options are all there in the room.Tell me what else do you require in a Room. Only they could do with some more storage like drawers and a luggage rack . Food: They have a breakfast Buffet from 07.30 to 10.30 am with a variety of dishes which include juices,cereals,croissants/bread,egg options(if you do not like the one on the buffet they can make your choice for you),hash brown,sausages,bacon,baked beans,one local dish like Rice or noodles and excellent coffee from the machine.The breakfast is both varied and adequate. The cafe where all the food is served is an extension of the Reception Area and kept absolutely clean all the time. Lunch is from 11.30 to 14.30 and consists of a set menu with several options of Continental, local(Fried Rice or Fried Noodles),some buger/hot dog options and some pasta etc. The choice is quite good, portions generous and the food tasty.Then for dessert you can help yourself to soft serve vanilla icecream with a choice of Chocolate or Strawberry Sauce.Also soft drink,juices and coffee are freely available. Happy Hours are from 18.00 to 20.00 where you can have your drinks (wine, beer, spirits etc. - house brand only) free and please note that the do not scrimp on the drinks and no sooner you are nearing the end of your drink there is a waiter who politely asks you whether you need another one. Great service all around. Dinner is from 18.00 to 22.00 hours and they have here a soup of the day and dessert of the day and at least 10 options of various dishes - Continental (Grilled Steak,Pan Fried or grilled fish or Chicken,some pastas,risottos and local dishes like nasi goreng,noodles,rice etc. and also 2 items of Special Dishes for the Day. The menu changes everyday but I suooose if you stay for a long period there is bound to be some repetetion.Not Gourmet food but extremely well presented, tasty and generous portions. The dessert while I was there were Tiramisu and another day Chocolate balls or Chocolate Profit Rolls. Yummy. Service: Top notch with smiling people all around and they make you feel at Home both at the Reception and in the Cafe.Alicia the girl at the front office even printed my boarding pass and called a taxi for me. Location: It is around 10 mins leisurely walk to the Orchard Road. Returning back is a gradual incline but nothing much unless you have small children or mobility issues. I thought it very good exercise after all that food . In any case you can always take a taxi which is extremely cheap in Singapore. To sum up this would be an experience of a lifetime and wish more Hotels should introduce this concept or at least a half board concept since most people are away for lunch.If you are in Singapore for a gastomanical experience and wish to move around all over Singapore in search of that perfect meal and to sample all the local dishes then this Hotel is not for you. However, if you have already done the food street experience once and are on a repeat visit to Singapore and would like to relax and enjoy a couple of drinks and some good quality food and experience the All Inclusive concept at a very competetive price and VFM then look no further than Quincy.

The room was compact, but not too small, with a modern/contemporary decor. Important things: the bed was very comfortable, slept great from day one; and the shower had great water pressure with a choice of hand held or rain shower head. No waiting for hot water either. Nice bed linens, thick towels and Moulton Brown bath products. Only downside to the room was there was no plug in the bathroom for the provided hair dryer so it had to be used in the room and the plug was not by a mirror. Overall though, not a big deal since everything else was so great. The breakfast had many choices of hot and cold items; and the dinners were very good... especially the pastas, many of them handmade! When I commented to the waiter on how excellent the pasta dishes were he told me that the head chef was Italian. After running around Singapore all day, it was very relaxing to be able to have a nice dinner with wine at the hotel... although the dining room setting was very casual and not fancy, the food was great and the menu varied each night. The pool area was nice, with a few chaises and a couch/sitting area set up, but the pool water was very cold, so we did not use it. It was a nice view though from the 12th floor pool deck. The airport pick up was very convenient, and our taxi back to the airport at the end of our visit was only 18SD. Our flight in was 6 a.m., and although we weren't able to check in that early (well, we could have paid extra, but we wanted to start exploring Singapore), they had some shower rooms that we were able to freshen up in, they kept our bags for us and we were able to check in early, just after lunch, with no extra charge.

In fact, the black phone cord was so dusty the inside of it looked light grey and fuzzy! Disgusting. The decorative headboard also had a thick layer of dust on top. I called housekeeping to ask them to dust when they serviced the room the next day, but they did not. Pretty unacceptable. Another complaint was that it was Chinese New Year and we were told by the lady at the front desk that Chinatown would be dead so not to bother going there. We found out the next day that in fact there had been a parade in Chinatown that night and the neighborhood was packed. That was a deal breaker and so we will not go back where the staff is so clueless about the town they live in, especially as we told her we were there for CNY. They also said they had a list of the 'only' restaurants open, which again was a lie. Maybe they were getting paid a commission?

The concept is disarmingly simple; include everything in the price that other hotels charge through the nose for, design the rooms to be elegant and simple, treat the guests as part of the family and then let them relax. We really enjoyed our stay here; our room was on the 8th floor and the RFID 'key' means it is easy to open the door. We arrived into Singapore early (around 07.00), were picked up by a driver and his Mercedes and whisked off to the hotel. A small niggle is that check-in isn't until 14.00 so we had to twiddle our thumbs for a while. Nonetheless the staff couldn't have been more helpful, suggesting we could freshen up on the 12th floor, where the pool, gym and sauna/steam rooms were. The showers are beautiful; they're walk in rain showers and there were plenty of towels to grab if we needed them. The pool is beautifully appointed although there are only three sun loungers so it's first come first served. Our room was perfect for us; Moulton Brown products, accessories such as hair dryer/iron etc were thoughtfully arranged all in one place so you don't have to 'hunt them down' and there was a large bath as well as a huge rain-shower. The mini-bar is stocked with water, soft drinks and a couple of cans of beer and you are invited to help yourself. There are facilities to make a cup of tea though there is no milk. Each room can choose to have 2 items dry-cleaned or laundered by the hotel. My wife was sceptical but I dropped off a pair of trousers and a linen shirt at the front-desk at 09.00 and they were ready and brought to our room around 18.00 that same day. They looked as if I had just bought them! Happy Hour is from 18.00 to 20.00 and the service we got was first class; our glasses were never empty and the bar man was excellent at keeping his eye on things and coming up to the guests for a chat. Dinner was good but a bit 'hit and miss'; the menu is a limited one (although it is 'a la carte' and not a dreadful choice of help yourself bain-maries); we would have enjoyed more Singapore dishes but again this is a slight niggle and didn't detract from the experience. Breakfast was excellent although most of the guests seem to twig that much of Singapore doesn't open until 10.00 so they tend to have a late breakfast, which means most people arriving at the same time with a limited number of tables. Even so, we only had a 5 minute wait for a table. To get to Orchard Road is incredibly easy and is a gentle stroll from the hotel. Once we were bored with the 'mall' concept, we took a taxi to Arab St and had a Moroccan peppermint tea at one of the cafes and then caught a bus to China Town for a late lunch. We both really liked this hotel; the experience has been carefully thought out to make it an elegant yet simple one to enjoy and agreed that we would certainly stay there next time we visit Singapore and I liked the fact that all ages seemed to feel equally comfortable.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok", "Title": "\u201cVery stylish modern and efficient\u201d", "Author": "Ch B", "ReviewID": "UR123903070", "Content": "This fairly new set up hotel just of the Orchard Road on the hill, is a nice place to stay.

I read someone who complained that this is not a 5 star hotel and I understand that this is not a 5 star hotel in terms of luxury (although it is cracking) but for the package you get, the staff and food - this is excellent (which happens to be 5 star of trip advisor site). The hotel is modern, the rooms are clean and the bathrooms are lovely (shower amazing) with a nice touch of Molton Brown products. There is a very large tv on the wall, a coffee machine and mini bar. All items in the mini bar are free - mostly soft drinks but a few tins of beer too. The only complaint I had was that we were woken a few times in the morning by the sound of water in pipes, like someone somewhere was flushing the toilet (room 301) and I think the hotel should look into this. The wifi is free. The pool (on the 12th floor) is open air and slightly overhangs the building which is pretty cool. Don't get me wrong, if you're an olympic swimmer, you're not going to get a massive work out but it was great to unwind after a day on your feet. There were loads of towels here for your use and another big fridge with free water/soft drinks. The sauna was lovely, as was the steam room and the small gym was modern. The food was very good - I was only there for 4 days so no issues with the choice. I can honestly say that there was always three or four choices on each menu I could have had. We also made use of the 2 hours free bar where you could get most alcoholic drinks. The restaurant staff were lovely - very attentive and friendly. The location of the hotel was fab - I read one review that complained that it was up a hill - I can only think this person lives in Holland where there are no hills because there was a slight incline to the hotel, nothing more and it was a 5 minute walk to Orchard Road. We had no issues with being collected by the hotel taxi either. We did arrange our own taxi for going back to the airport as the hotel would charge you $68 but arrange yourself it was only $45.

We were there a total of four nights and on the first night our room was hot and the aircon was just not reaching a comfortable level of coolness for us. We asked to have it seen to and a maintenance man was sent to check on it. He adjusted some things but after an hour we still did not notice any change and as it was late decided to tough it out and see what happened after more time. The following day it was still hot and humid in our room and the aircon was on so high we could not hear ourselves talk. We went down for breakfast and explained to the very helpful lady at the front desk that there was an issue. On our return from a day of shopping the room was yet again unbearable so we notified the front desk. Within a half hour they had moved us to a gorgeous corner room that was larger in size, more comfortable with a few special touches that the first room definitely could have done with. This room was perfect in temperature with everything working, as it should. This was not a room I saw advertised on the Quincy\u2019s website, if it was I would have reserved it as for us price is not necessarily the deciding factor. The room was more spacious and the bathroom more luxurious. Dinners are included in the Internet rate and I found the food served was really actually surprisingly good. There is a free cocktail hour but the staff is happy to reserve a glass or two of the wine or whatever for you so you can still have it with your dinner if you go over cocktail hour. The menu varied every with some interesting meals served and my fussy foodie palate was kept amused and happy. Not gourmet fare at al but honest and simple and good cooking being done in the kitchens. Breakfasts were a bit repetitive and boring but I did love the help yourself coffee machines that served a nice strong good quality fresh coffee. All in all the Quincy won big with us. There staff is brilliant and helpful, always smiling and ready to help when it is needed or just returns a friendly greeting. I loved the modern twist this hotel offers in so many areas and the location is excellent and close to the shopping mecca. Perhaps our only complaint was that as mentioned previously the Quincy needs to put the more luxurious rooms on the Internet as an option to reserve with perhaps more detailed photos. If the second room we were given was on the Internet it is most definitely the room I would have reserved. Our first room was adequate but small in size but still passable for a short stay. The Quincy also has a fascinating poll floor. My husband and I enjoyed one night sitting out in the cool air watching the lights and reading a newspaper.

The room was clean, slightly on the small side. The bathroom was good sized with a tub. The internet speeds were good and the minibar included a selection of soft drinks and two cans of lager. Given the higher cost of alcohol in Singapore, I think the included drinks in the Minibar and the free drinks in the evening is great. We arranged pickup from the airport and the driver was waiting when we arrived. The transfer in the Mercedes was around 20-30 minutes, although the car does have free wifi on board. Our driver was nice and the hotel reception staff were as to be expected. The staff at the restaurant area were also polite. The service is polite, but not too extreme which is what I visioned. I found the location pretty good. The main advantage is close proximity to the shops, malls and Orchard which is what I wanted. The hotel is located at the top of a small hill, but nothing too dramatic. The closest MRT is a 10-15 minute walk. The pool area is cut in to the building so is mostly shaded and the gym is small but well equipped. The pool area and gym have free drinks for guests.

We are Singaporeans and decided to make a reservation at the Quincy Hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We wanted a spot near to the Orchard Road shopping belt from which we could enjoy the restaurants and cafes in the vicinity. A lot has already been mentioned in other reviews so I would just focus on experiences that were unique to our stay. We had a room on the 13th floor, which is the second from the top if I was not mistaken. View was average, since it was surrounded by buildings of similar height. Room size was average for Singapore hotels but very well designed and fitted. Bathroom fittings were quality all through and Molton Brown toiletries was a nice touch. Even though all the meals were included, we decided to save our stomachs for restaurants that we had targeted before this stay. We did grab lunch after our check-in and the food was good. There was a decent selection to cater to most palates. Breakfast was average. Could understand why some reviews were critical as the rest of the package/hotel sort of raised our expectations. There is room for improvement but we were more than satisfied with the choice and quality. For a hotel with a small footprint, Quincy has done a good job putting in a small pool, gym and steam room on the 12th storey. Our focus was not to make use of these amenities during our stay but did check them out. We liked what we saw. Service was great both before and during the stay. As we are locals, airport transfer did not quite apply. I emailed the hotel to request for a pickup from a local address. The response was prompt and positive. No fuss at all. In view of our anniversary, a couple of bottles of Sauternes and a personalized card were left in our room while we were out on our first night. Icing on the cake, we must say!

Aside from the great location, the hotel itself is a pretty impressive sight. Very unique and cosmopolitan, it has a real architectural charm and great street appeal. Inside, the place reflects the same attention to trendy detail, with modern and stylish furnishings. Upon check in and throughout my entire stay, ALL the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful.

For a business traveller, it's also a great and easy option. However, it's proximity is to Orchard Rd and shopping - not the Financial or major Business districts.

What we noticed the most was the cleanliness and number of staff around the hotel cleaning and polishing the lifts, floors etc. The hotel also has a pool & gym on the 12th floor which is lovely and great views while you are paddling around. If I had to make a criticism it would be the buffet breakfast being a little average, but having said that they have a self serve coffee machine which made great cappacino and I am a coffee addict so this went down well! Highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok", "Title": "\u201cPerfect and Impeccable Service, Excellent Boutique Hotel, Impressive Amenities\u201d", "Author": "LawyeroftheYear", "ReviewID": "UR121282317", "Content": "Check in - convenient; fast and efficient Amenities - all working and serviced properly - nice gym, I used the pool and steam The hotel is well designed, trendy, Apple Macs in the lobby for surfing the net, wi fi throughout - good coffee and lots of free water regularly replenished.

We chose it based on Trip Advisor reviews, location (5-10 min. walk from Orchard Road shopping district and MRT station), and price. The Trip Advisor reviews for the Quincy are right on the money. This is a great boutique hotel at a great price, considering all the perks. The hotel is clean and modern but not fussy. It is described as very \"trendy,\" but I did not think it any trendier than a W Hotel, for example, and the staff was certainly very friendly and accomodating. The hotel seems to make an attempt to make guests feel at home, with free yoga on Sat., cupcake baking classes on Sat., and once/week \"movie night\" at the very cool infinity pool on the 12th floor. If I were a business traveller in Singapore, I think this would be a very comforting place to stay. Included in our room rate ($235/night) was a limo transfer from the airport, two free pieces of laundry or drycleaning/day (LOVED THIS, having been in humid Thailand the week before), free Wi-Fi (excellent speed and connection on my iPhone), free local calls, free minibar( water, tea, soda, beer), free cocktails from 6-8 PM, and breakfast/lunch/dinner. We did not eat 3 meals a day, but found the hotel food to be pretty decent. Breakfast was a buffet with Asian and Western options. The pasta we had for dinner was surprisingly good, but there are simply too many great places to eat in Singapore to be eating at the hotel all the time! The rooms are small (like NYC or any large city) but well-designed and feel larger than they are. The beds were a bit firm for my taste, but linens were nice quality and pillows soft. Bath was good-sized with separate (large) tub and shower. The toilet was Japanese-style with attached bidet. Toiletries were by Molton Brown, always a plus. We had no significant trouble with noise during our stay. We did not use the pool or workout rooms but did check them out. The pool is very nice with a lovely city view and free water, sodas, and beer and towels available at the pool. The workout area is small but has very nice, new, state-of-the art machines. We enjoyed our stay at the Quincy very much. When we return to Singapore, we would definitely consider returning. I think I might have preferred a location closer to the river as I am not a big shopper, but a similarly charming hotel there (Fullerton was beautiful) would have been twice as expensive.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent service!\u201d", "Author": "emmoo", "ReviewID": "UR120990035", "Content": "Quincy Just back from my Singapore trip not too long ago.

My friend and I checked into Quincy on 22 October 2011 for the weekend. Firstly, the day before the check-in, my friend who made the booking received a call from the hotel asking if we are interested in the Baking Class. Although we did not join the class, we were thankful for the effort made by the hotel staff to verify before we check in. Upon checking in, we were told to wait for our room in the restaurant and take our lunch because they needed to verify which room was the twin room. We were rather puzzled due to this, and finally asked them about it, when the front desk staff very candidly told us that the twin beds used to be together, serving as a King bed, and now Housekeeping will be pulling them apart while we have our lunch. We were rather amused by it. (But let me assure you... the beds were gloriously comfortable.) That evening, when we were having our dinner, the staff of the hotel appeared with a Tiramisu cake to wish my friend \"Happy Birthday\". Apparently when they updated our particulars into their system, they noticed that my friend's birthday was the day before and surprised my friend with a birthday cake and a personalised birthday card! For the past few years, we have been celebrating birthdays with staycations and this was the only hotel which did something like that without being prompted. Thank You to Quincy Hotel for making my friend's birthday weekend memorable! The room was well equipped, cozy with the complimentary mini-bar, the wi-fi (so many hotels in Singapore do not have that!). The bed was comfortable, and they allowed for late check out. The food at the restaurant was good too! I have stayed in many hotels, even hotels such as St. Regis and Hotel Fort Canning. I have to say that Quincy Hotel was the best staycation I ever had with my friends and I will sincerely recommend it to people. I may be back for my next staycation too!

Called down to the reception and the receptionist; Claudette/Claudine - i need to confirm her name - switched me to a new room without hesitating. I didnt even need to ask for a switch. Two mns later she personally delivered the new keys with an apology. Furthermore, she knew that my brother had checked out earlier in the day and consequently took the initiative to put me in a king size bed as opposed to a twin room without my even requesting it. That was what i appreciated more than anything. So i walked into my room later that night only to find a personalised letter apologising for the 'mini swimming pool' in my room - not to mention the personalised Molton Brown giftbag with several toiletries (that werent even offered as a standard in the room). Overall, the hotel is very well located, has free internet (a big deal in a world in which established five star brands dont), a few free bears and at least seven free bottles of water per room! Had i selected a St. Regis, Four Seasons or Shangri-La - i wouldve paid at least S$400. The Quincy stood at about S$280/night and while it had several kinks (bar isnt open late night, free drinks at the bar btw 2-8pm didnt extend to my friend who was hanging with us --> even though we were two guests in the bedroom the first night) i would definitely say this hotel is excellent value for money ..

If there was only one thing we could have done with in the rooms it would have been more storage space. Nonetheless, the bed was very comfortable indeed, the hotel quiet despite its location (very convenient to Orchard Road shops and MRT) and the free minibar a great idea. We enjoyed the gym and the groovy swimming pool on the 12th floor (the temperature of the pool was cool which is just what you need in humid Singapore). The waiting staff in the restaurant were great and the drinks at cocktail hour and the wine during dinner, were free flowing. We ate breakfast and also dinner at the hotel both nights. The menu changed between nights and there were daily specials as well. The selection is predominantly western with a strong pasta bias but there was also fish and steak on the menu. The starter was soup and bread and there was a different dessert each night or alternatively a help yourself soft serve icecream or fruit salad.

As we were an early arrival (8am) we were offered the opportunity to pay extra for a room available then, or wait until it was ready.

Rooms were nicely decorated in a modern look but the bed was just lovely as we succumbed to jetlag about 12.30. Reception said our room would be available at 11.30 and right on the dot, they came over and took us up. We had a corner top floor room overlooking the east and the view was spectacular at night, especially when it stormed every afternoon. Did not use the pool but it is a lovely area to read and relax. Having all meals included was great and the range was varied and suitable. A short walk to Orchard Road and transport but out of the noisy bustle.

I booked a room and breakfast package through pyo travel website. When we got to the room, the attendant asked us if we wanted to add $30 per day for wireless internet, minibar. I was a little annoyed as I thought wireless internet would at least be included in a hotel like this and didn't think Sin$30 per day was reasonable. Luckily there was 2 mac computers I could use at the lobby. The other thing I was surprised about was the water stains mark around the bath tub (looked a bit like rust) and also there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. And on my third day, the cleaners took both my bathrobes away so there was no bathrobe to wear at all. Regarding the good points of this hotel.. it is very close to the Orchard MRT.. took us 10 mins to walk there. So it was very convenient for shopping and going out. Secondly service from the receptionists is very good. One night, one of them offered to book a table at a restaurant for me which I was very happy with. Thirdly the bed is very comfortable which helped us with sleep. And the room is very quiet (infact I could not hear any traffic noise at all). Fourthly, the pool area is nice with the sauna, steam facilities and seating area. With breakfast, I think the range of food you can get is rather basic compared to some hotels that I have been to.

Great 'all-inclusive' boutique concept but didnt value my trip this time\u201d", "Author": "PandoraSkies", "ReviewID": "UR117068345", "Content": "On paper, the Quincy is everything a chic city boutique should be, with a dramatic design exterior that is as exciting inside from reception to rooms to restaurant and, based on this alone, I want to sing the Quincy praises. Regrettably, however, my stay was somewhat marred by a poor customer experience but I am confident, based on others feedback during my stay that certainly stood out as the exception to the many other reviews Quincey has received and, albeit bad luck in my case, would appear to be just that. Focussing on the positives (and there were many) from a design perspective, expect the Wow Factor - neon lights, egg chairs, waterfall patio, 12th floor pool and state of the art technology in the rooms - definitely a stand out in a road of more tradtitional hotels and everything the boutique traveller wants to see. Rooms are small by Singapore standards but normal for boutique. Decor is chic and modern and rooms have quirky glass cubed bathrooms that allow you to view the skyline as you take a hot soak and are accessorised with lush Molton Brown products. The monsoon showers are incredibly addictive! 12th floor pool is adequate and chills to a mediterranean vibe after dark and there is a well equipped gym and sauna. Well located on the hub of shopping on Orchard Road you are met with some of the best Gucci and Armani stores globally, more luxe than their NYC 5th avenue counterparts. That said, Singapore is a competitve city for chic hotels, whether large scale or boutique the price point can be similar and unless the all inclusive really works for your personal needs there may be better options elsewhere with equally and higher style that are sure to exceed on service. Quincy distinguishes itself in this compettive space as the first in all inclusive to the boutique hotels but this under delivered for me on this trip (mini bar is soft drinks only and a few snacks, all inc bar is at a time i was heading into town for dinner) so it may not have had the true value for money I expceted or enough to distinguish Quincy over others. travelling in a group tho, this would work well. Again as I was oin a short stay to see the city, flexibility was key and , unlike typical all inclusive offerings you may find in Europe or other cities, Quincy places a restriction to set times for meals which conflicts with the diary of anyone exploring a city like Singapore and there are much better ciulinary options in the trendy Clarke Quay or adventurous China Town. The restaurant is not extensive, but the menu is good, so it can serve for early evening refuelling and still eat late evening elsewhere. The cocktail hour 6-8pm is a nice touch but for short breaks there is a need for caution with sitting times as you may not synchronise for the lunch and/or dinneror breakfast on your arrival and departure days. The all inlcusive extends to mini bar, although the reality is that these are 95% soft drinks and a few snacks. My personal experience was that this wasn't replenished during the course of my weekend stay but I think I had an exceptional hit of misfortune and following my trip the hotel have made an incredible goodwill offer to counteract, which is sure to have me revisit. wifi in rooms is insecure - certificates have expired so you may not be able to access devices, although there are imacs in the lobby. The wifi cited in the airport limo service is not available.

Location is on a hill behind the main shopping street of Singapore, Orchard Road, so you can say it is fairly central generally speaking. The walk to Orchard Road is around 5-8 minutes but is kind of hilly so despite the short distance, it can become kind of dreadful with all the shopping bags under the scorching heat of this great island. So somehow we couldnt decide whether the location was great or not. It was definitely walking distance to the subway and Orchard Road but the walk was not a very easy and smooth one.... Service was ok, they kind of tried to be friendly which is already quite something in Spore where in most places you get fast and efficient service but not a friendly or polite one even in top rated places. We did notice though that the night reception staff were pretty much clueless about dining and entertainement spots in Singapore though. But overall service was fine. The room itself was kind of small but very modern and nicely designed. Mini bar was included in the rate which was cool. The pool on one of the top floors was great and the fact it is open 24 hours was really convenient for those arriving on late flights.

Efficient transfer to the hotel in a late model Mercedes set the positive tone for the rest of our stay. Service from all staff was second-to-none. Our twin share room was faultless - the best sleep I have had in ages (perfect mattress & pillow and gorgeous top-quality bed linen). The rain shower - OMG, what can I say? Worth the stay alone! We used the hotel gym and the pool every day; again top notch, Unlimited bottled water around the hotel, wireless internet, iPod docks, plus free minibar and laundry... great! The room rate includes all meals and we initailly thought we wouldn't eat at the hotel restaurant (other than at breakfast) as we were fully expecting a basic lunch and dinner-time buffet with dried out bain-maries of yesterday's leftovers... Nope - its all a la carte dining - and very very nice food to boot. We ended up having three out of four dinners at the Qunicy, plus a couple of lunches - the menu changes every day.

After comparing the rates of Singapore boutique hotels, we decided that Quincy has the best deal in town. I only made my reservation a week before my stay. By then, through the online booking, there were no more king size bed rooms available. I settled for the 2 single beds but decided to email them if they could help. I got a prompt reply from them a few hours later saying that they will take note. On the website, they mentioned it is a 5mins walk from Orchard MRT station. We exited at Lucky Plaza from Orchard MRT station, turn left and head up Nutmeg Road and turn right walking past Mt Elizabeth Hospital. From there on, it\u2019s a gradual climb and coupled with Singapore hot weather at 3.30pm plus our baggage, our walk slowed to a crawl and we only reached Quincy after 10mins. The reception staff Holly who served me saw that I was drenched in sweat offered me some tissues (very thoughtful). After giving me the room cards, internet login code and a bottle of red wine, I thought the process was done but she actually came out to accompany us to our room and even explained all the equipments and stuff when inside the room. I asked if they do wedding banquets which unfortunately no, but she mentioned they could decorate the room with rose petals upon request. I missed the chance, but it\u2019s good to note that they have such service. Room wise, their design is modern chic and to my surprise, they actually manage to give me the king bed. The full height window commends great city-view even from my 8th floor. Complimentary toiletries and minbar were provided. Abundance of towels were given ranging from different sizes. Bathroom has a bathtub, a rain-shower area and integrated bidet system. Equipments wise \u2013 iron & iron board, ipod docking system, broadband internet cable, safe deposit and 40\u201d LCD TV. Level 12 is where the swimming pool, gym and sauna/steam bath are located. They are open 24hrs. There is also a relax corner with sofa and bar counter to laze and enjoy the city view. Beverages and towels were available. The area wasn\u2019t crowded during my stay there but I prefer to have lesser people while using the facilities so I only head there after 10pm. IMO, level 12 isn\u2019t rain-proof and their sofa and day beds were soaking wet during heavy rain. The sofa and day beds covers were quite stained and looked worn, probably due to the exposure elements. Hope they can frequently change the covers. Apart from that, everything looks new including the gym equipments. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were all inclusive during the stay. Breakfast is the buffet type, but there are almost 12 selections of meals for lunch and dinner. The hotel only has one dining area and hence breakfast time is usually packed. Notice people came down at 9.30am for breakfast (ends at 10.30am) and that was when the queue was formed. Try to go down earlier to avoid the crowds as the area is small and tables might not be enough to accommodate a huge influx of people at one go. My stay was very pleasant and definitely the hotel looks 5stars to me. Their customer service was however 6stars. While checking-out, they handed me a staff nomination card. Actually I felt bad to only name 2 persons because the whole team were superb.

ALL inclusive. you get a choice of decent set menus to choose from for dinner. Drinks, free flow housepour (Famous Grouse is their housepour whisky), wine,beer. This free flow was really highly recommended As we were both heavy drinkers who could easily drink up 1 bar in 1 night. The only cafe/bar//resturant in this hotel overlooks a pretty mini chic fountain to create a romantic ambience with the yellow lights at the courtyard at night. Breakfast had quite a number of hot food selection to cure a hangover. Can't say you really get the most comfortable position eating and sitting in an arty fatsy chair, class and comfy seldom marry together. Even had a bottle of red wine and plate of chocolates waiiting for us in the room afters lights down, not sure if that was paid extra. Gym/pool: small, but self sufficient. Could have been better if the bar is by the pool for the free flow. Smoking. Non smoking building. Cheers and kudos.

Granted, there is no single universally understood meaning on what a \"boutique hotel\" delivers, so there is no criticising Quincy for describing themselves as such. Why upmarket YMCA? Well, the sense I get is that the hotel has adopted the business model of stripping away anything that is superfluous to providing a comfortable bedroom for guests, thereby reducing staff and other costs and, to some extent, reflecting the cost savings in the room rate. For instance, there is no restaurant really, just a YMCA style self service type canteen. There is no bar or lounge to relax in. There is hardly a reception area, just a bit of corridor between main door and said canteen. Business centre? Please use the bit at the end of the canteen area that seems to double up as a conference table, or there are two Macs in the corridor by the said canteen. There is laundry but you need to drop them off at reception. As for newspapers in the morning, please pick them up at reception yourself. That said, it has a perfectly functional gym.

Parking: Is a tight car park at neighbouring Elizabeth hotel, but free parking available upon request at the concierge. Check in: Very pleasant and painless. Took no more than 5 minutes. Staff brought us up and showed us around the room which was nice. We were given a slip explaining what was included in the package and meal times, and the wifi user ID and password as well. Lobby area: Small lobby which is linked to the restaurant where the meals are served. Large supply of newspapers and 2 Mac computer terminals for surfing. Lovely landscaping surrounding the lobby and restaurant area which was nice through the floor to high ceiling windows. Room: Very nice size with lovely bay window on the side with electric black out blinds which the staff member demonstrated to us along with operation of the other items in the room. We liked the layout of the room, i felt that it was very well thought out and every space was well utilised without feeling tight or squeezy. We were even offered cables to link our lap top to the tv so we could watch stuff off our computer, or borrow some dvds from the reception. Bed was very comfortable. The toilet had a \"open concept\" with clear class at the tub area (which was comfortable). We were of course thrilled with the well stocked fridge (2 each of soya bean, chrysanthenum, green tea packets, diet pepsi and pepsi, sprite and beer) and snacks (2 packs of chips and 1 cup noodle) with coffee and tea. Lots of bottled water. TIP: there is \"unlimited\" stocks of roughly the same drinks and water in the chiller at the pool side. The room was tiled (save for a carpet under the bed) which we would have preferred to be carpetted throughout as it got cold from the aircon especially at night. Gym/ Pool: Gym looks very new and state of the art. Nice fluffy towels and water available. At the pool area, the deck was very nice place to chill out with nice sofas and papers and magazines. The chiller is well stocked with ice cold drinks. We did feel the music was a tad loud though. The pool itself is stunning (especially at night) as it is encased by clear glass all around and \"hangs out\" of the 12th floor of the building. As it is sheltered, the water is very cold! The construction around the hotel was not very noisy but did affect the enjoyment of the pool. Food: We ate 3 meals which were included. Dinner was nice with mostly pasta choices and some asian fare (About 8 different choices). We liked the soup, salad and free flow ice cream. Lunch was similar to dinner in terms of items but were different. We liked our lunch and dinner meals. Breakfast was something that we felt could be much better. The choices were very limited and food was not appetizing. We especially liked the self serve coffee machines available at all meal times with take away cups available which was a nice touch.

Had high expectations but sadly disappointed on quite a few levels. Free meals included were below average. Steak was overcooked. Happy hour - their choice in wines could be improved. I'm not a wine expert but it tasted super cheap!!! Breakfast had sufficient variety but cooked food was only average in taste. For those who look forward to nice b/fast at hotels - this would prob disappoint. I guess its cos meals are included into price of this hotel. So for those who are not foodies, this concept is great value but execution is generally poor. There really is no such thing as a free (good) meal in this world. And I realised this place is managed by Far East & for those who are familiar - their reputation is to kinda cut corners and generally they're cheap! I was surprised that the toiletries provided from the very high end brand Molten Brown...were really disappointing - extremely poor quality of moisturising lotion (felt cheap) and shampoos also rather crappy. My partner & I were wondering whether this is just a low end hotel range from Molten Brown. If this is a true representation of their actual collection - I am so glad I never bought their stuff - I would feel very ripped off. Good points - thoughtful to provide take away coffee cups for our convenience. Complimentary laundry is a bonus. Beds are comfy. House keeping service has been prompt. Good hotel but not sure I would return. Location a little inconvenient. Think I would use the same $300+ for a room without the free meals at Royal Plaza or Mandarin Meritus.

Stay on 24 - 26 Feb 2011 Read the last 1 star is 6 months back, but seems nothing has been done for upgrading especially the restaurant. It may seems fun to have all-in service in a 4 stars hotel, of which you may want to expect an exceptional buffet b'fast lunch and dinner. Had twice b'fast, once b'fast and once dinner. B'fast is common with porridge, dry crispy hash, \"charcoal\" bacon (burnt), chappati, dal, and cereal with its assortment. For lunch i selected pan fried steak which is super dry and hardly to chew. My dinner worst (attached photo) ravioli with burnt bacon. Waiter is good enough offering to change, no more appetite.They have salad (cannot find during dinner), soups, ice cream and serve-by-yourself coffee and tea. Have red-wine during dinner. Not a wine-drinker, but believe it is quite nice. From airport we have our pick up arranged (free from hotel - one way) with mercedes. Happened to arrive early after 5 hours flight and arrive hotel by 10am. we are told that the hotel is fully booked and have to wait till 2pm coz it is the time to check in. I purposely book from their website (best available rate - of which is SGD433 per night) compare to agoda which charge SGD 304 by time i do the booking) in expectation for early check in. And after requesting and was promised to be informed in 1 hour, we are made to wait for another hour. It was around 13.00 and by time we asked, we were informed that we still have to wait and was informed to book additional one day before to ensure we got the room. I was too tired to argue by then and ask to cancel one night of my stay and was told impossible. After insisting,i was told that they need to consult their assistant manager, of whom came out and ask me to do the cancellation from the internet. By time I was able to get through the internet, it appears that i cannot find my reservation anymore, and in less than 1 minute i was told my room is ready - well how can i find my reservation after it was made check-in? Anyway, i went to my room and found that some maintenance still being done. Hotel location is appx 10 min walk to orchard, free wi-fi (i would say fast), mini bar is for free with mineral water, some box juices, and couple can of soft drink (coke, pepsi, 7up) and 2 beers. Room i have no much to complain except the carpet is only surrounding the bed whilst other area are plain. make sure you have your sandal worn all the time. Toiletries from Molton Brown. Gym is small but decent except change room, sauna, steam is mixed for ladies and gents. Pool are small on 12th floor, bit windy, still acceptable. Unless you are staying full day in hotel, i don't suggest to stay here. This is a non-smoking hotel and make sure you don't ask for early check-in, they won't entertain unless you are willing to pay additional one more night. If you are westener, you may find the staffs are helpful, of which i don't except waiters in restaurant all are great - not the food. I never remember i had any burnt bacon, not to mention in a four stars hotel, even in any hawker center. i am a business traveller 40-50x a year.

Complimentary of Quincy as a package. I found out that literally everything is complimentary. In room mini bar and even all my meals there! The room was overlooking orchard road and it was modern chic style. See thru toilet and stylist room setting blew me away. They had iPod dock which was a pleasant surpise. Managed to fill my room with music all night. The have hdmi, usb and many more connection to their flat screen tv. I wished the bed was much more fluffy and have a thicker feather pillows. The facilities was great too. 24h access to the infinity swimming pool was great! Had a dip at 1am and sauna after that. Well i am a late night kinda person! Gym equipment was top of the range. Even higher range models than what is found in Fitness First. In terms of location, getting there is a little troublesome for me. Tugging my luggage from the Orchard Mrt, i realise is not as near as i thought it was. It was a hilly climb to the hotel. Nevertheless its is nearby shopping centre Paragon and Far East Plaza.

Once in our room Paulo (who is fantastic and very helpful) showed us the \"hidden storage\" and how to work everything. The beds were amazing and so comfy. In a drawer in the room we found crisps, noodles, numerous differnt teas, coffee, sugar and all this was replenished every day. The free minibar was a welcome change and the 6 bottles of water a day in it were great. (And yes it really is all included!) However if that was not enough you could go to the pool area and help yourself to a fully stocked fridge of cold soft drinks and more water. We only ate one main meal in the hotel and it was the best steak I had had my whole trip. The breakfast was more than ample catering for all nationalities from chicken porridge to bacon & eggs, curry, to croissants and cold meats to cereal. An extra great touch was the self service coffe machines with takeaway coffe cups incase you wanted breakfast on the run...brilliant. The rooms were brilliant and the bathrooms amazing. There is free internet access in the foyer with apple computers as well. One night about 11pm we informed the front desk we did not think our air conditioning was working properly and within 5 minutes there was a maintenece man in the celing of our room fixing the problem.

I was very positively surprised by its position (5-min walk from Orchard road), in a very quiet neighbourhood, the very \"Qool\" design of the hotel, its decoration, and even more by the amenities provided in the rooms, which are what you expect to get from a 4-star hotel. The bathtub (you may even follow your favourite tv program or movie from it, thanks to this ingenious idea of a huge glass window between room and bath. Or close the curtain for more privacy\u2026! ) and a real walk-in shower with all you can think of in bath amenities. The all-inclusive system works very nicely: Breakfast is quite complete and offers a nice range to choose from (cereals, bacon, excellent chicken sausages, greens, croissants and toasted bread, porridge, salty specialities such as noodles or omelettes, even Hindu food, and above all, OHHHH !!! the strange green stuff that turns out to be the local, exquisite KAYA, of which I shall say no more, you just HAVE to taste it !! ) Then you may choose every lunch and dinner between about 10 different main courses + soup + dessert of the day (+ ice cream always available). And all drinks of course (wine, juices, sodas...). Then if you want to relax from your all-day excursion go to the 12th storey where you will relax in the open-air pool (which is in the open-air even protruding outside the building, and I mean it!) or work-out and/or sweat in both steam room and sauna. All the staff from front desk to waiters or housekeepers really enjoy what they do. And when you need them don't hesitate, they are always willing to attend to your needs.

The pool area on the 12th floor was fantastic and private with great views. A really nice experience. We both have a love of modern architecture, interior design and horticulture.

Even though the issue was handled well, I was disappointed that we were given the room in the first place, since I assume the water pressure issue may be an ongoing problem with that particular room. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and professional. The all inclusive package was great value. Even though we did not get an opportunity to have any lunches and we only had two dinners in the hotel we felt we really got our moneys worth from the airport pick up, the two pieces of laundry each day (fantastic!) and breakfast every morning. The two dinners we had were very tasty and the menu selection was great. The staff in the restaurant area was very friendly and helpful. The pool was great also, for 3 days straight we had the pool to ourselves in the afternoon. I enjoyed the fact you could help yourself to drinks in the fridge at the pool and use all the towels you needed.

We tried lunch 1 day and it was great. Also note this is the only restaurant in the hotel. Rooms: The hotel is very new and modern.

Everything is new and in great shape. Pool/gym: The pool area is different that the usual. It's on the 12th floor so great city views. It's an infinity pool.

We stayed there for three nights and all the experience were great. Can you imagine with $378 with those facilities we get 3 meals + free minibar + free local phone + airport pick up by limo + wifi + free 2 pieces of laundry/day + cocktail hour, we think its worth it, compare if we need to stay at Value Hotel Thomson. We made comparison if we were stayed at Value Hotel Thomson instead Quincy, we only paid approx. $200 more for 3 days (For taxi, meals, laundry etc) which I know that's nothing, but the things that we could not compare ware to feel the comfort, coziness & obviously friendly staffs in the hotel. We felt infused by the bedroom, the pillow (goose down) & mattress,it made us slept really really well that night. The staffs, When we arrived Leo and the chinese lady (sorry , forgot you name) helped us our checked in and due its late night there was no porter to bring our suitcases to our room, and you know what Leo brought our suitcases to our room. Impressive ! We were impressed the hospitality by Jesslyn (hope the spelling is correct), Frances, and the waiter Chandri. We know its better if the room is bigger but its acceptable. But for the limo service why is only from Airport to the hotel ? because due we arrive from Value Hotel Thomson by regular taxi so we cant use the facility, maybe in the future Quincy could compensates for take us to the airport using the limo.

We booked 4 rooms thru booking.com (@350 sing dollar/room/night) and requested for the rooms in the same floor. Since we were traveling with kids and my mom is a cancer patient, what was the deciding factor about the hotel was the all inclusive deal. In case the kids or mom were exhausted or in the mood to stay in, the all inclusive service would prove handy. What started off as an ideal hotel choice with the prompt pick up from the airport and smooth check in of the 4 rooms being given on the 14th floor turned into a nightmarish 4 days. Don't be fooled into trying this place with your family. This is an good business hotel PERIOD. Will sum up by with highlighting a few points that all visitors must be aware of while booking Quincy - LOBBY & RESTAURANT - the hotel has a trendy business look but with the tiniest lobby and one narrow passage way that they call a restaurant/coffee shop - all meals are served at this place that cant seat more than 50 ppl at one time and the menu is SAME for breakfast, circulated every 2 days for lunch and dinner - some of the staff members are quite helpful and warm but the staff at the 'restaurant' are rude and obnoxious. Not at all at par with even 3-4 star service standard - the all inclusive deal does not cover children (no matter what age) and the food is BAD. - when we checked in we were told, kids (aged 5, 5 and 3) could eat breakfast but other meals would be a la carte. But every time we sat to eat we were questioned about it by the staff which was humiliating and upsetting to say the least. the front desk had to come and sort it out each time. ROOMS - Beware, the rooms are tiny! there is just enough space around the bed to walk around. No space to keep your luggage if you are staying longer than 4 days - the housekeeping service is pathetic as well. all they did was make the bed and vacuum the area around the bed. they should learn a thing or 2 from other star hotels - the mini bar is limited to 2 beer cans and 4 soft drinks as beverage options and 2 packs of chips as food but is a good value add - the AC in the rooms were not working and we had to call and ask maintenance to come fix it every night LOCATION - the hotel is a min 10 min uphill walk from orchard road and the MRT making it impossible to walk it with kids. - there is a shortcut to the mrt through the 'York Hotel' lobby across the road but can be uncomfortable and embarrassing as you have to walk through some other hotel (and that too is a 10 min walk) - the neighborhood is quiet and ideal for business travelers. you feel odd in the hotel full of business suits when you are in shorts and tee and a holiday mood with kids running around. - if you want to stay at Orchard, there are a dozen other better options that are bang on orchard road. dont pick this hotel if you're coming for a holiday and want quick access to malls, mrt, eating joints. SERVICE - mixed. the senior staff is well trained and warm, the waiting staff is a nightmare. try it to believe it FACILITIES - the pool is a joke if you are used to 5 star pools. its on the 12th floor and not barely 20 mt long and 5 mt wide. since its covered, the water is chilly even on a hot humid day. children are not allowed the pool!! and there is no separate child pool. - the gym is as big or small as the rooms with no instructors or trainers but with quality equipment - the internet access and speed is a big plus plus esp for business travelers - the tv channel options are v limited - there is no bar, eating area barring the lobby coffee shop making the place very prone to claustrophobia if you are a seasoned traveller and have seen high quality service and certain level of standard and are traveling with kids, then you most surely will hate this place. but if you are a business traveller in the city for a night or 2 and are looking for a trendy boutique hotel in a quiet neighborhood with free internet laundry facilities and all inclusive meal package then this place is ideal for you. at the end of the day, I believe I made the wrong choice in picking Quincy over Mandarin, Marriott, Four Seasons or other such options in the same budget.

This was my second visit to Singapore and I was looking forward to my next foray into this ultra urber city. First time around I stayed at the Shangri-La on Orchard Road, Krunthep Wing no less. This hotel is best summarised by fab service, fab facilities and a fab location so consequently, highly recommended! I do however try and not revisit the same hotel over and over again as I believe repeats if any, should really be confined to the TV, life's just too short! Having scoured TA as usual for ideas and suggestions, the Quincy Hotel was chosen as the location, facilities and price all seemed to offer a nice balance and so, how was it I hear you ask... Well dear viewer; pretty good! If your an inveterate page scanner, you can safely leave now assured choosing The Quincy is unlikely to disappoint you. For the rest of you, please read on as the devil's in the detail and I do so enjoy detail... To begin proper, I pre-booked 3 nights directly with the hotel via their website and arrived a little hot and sweaty but on schedule at least. I was greeted at reception by Nat, one of the Service Executive's at the hotel, who confirmed my reservation and duly completed the necessary paperwork. I was then shown to my room and it was then that I discovered there was a slight problem, at least for me. In essence, had I been travelling with a small furry feline friend for company say, then the only swinging that could have occurred would have been on the radio as the room would have simply been too small to accommodate the both of us, truly this gave bijou a new definition! I immediately decided that it was not for me at which point, I turned to the chap who brought me to the room and said, \u201cNo, not acceptable, we go!\u201d I then returned to Nat at reception to explain my unhappiness. To further compound matters, whilst discussing room availability I was then informed that due to essential maintenance, the pool was closed (hot and sweaty, remember?), the deep sigh that escaped was one of frustration rather than anger. Unfortunately, the pool facility was one of the deciding factors for me in choosing the Quincy therefore, it wasn't simply a matter of, \u201coh well, never mind\u201d! Furthermore, as I had personally confirmed the pool facility with the hotel directly, I simply couldn't understand why no attempt was made to inform me prior to my arrival of the change of circumstances. Enter Ruben, Service Executive number 2. Ruben listened and nodded at the appropriate moments, this at least enabled me to properly explain why for me, the current situation was untenable. After some initial confusion, it emerged that the pool's unavailability was not due to planned maintenance as originally suggested by my earlier companion, but was an essential repair which was therefore, unavoidable. What was I to do? The room was actually quite nice but just too small for this single lone traveller even without a cat, I have standards to maintain after all dear viewer! Ruben asked if prehaps a larger room would help to ease my current state of dissatisfaction; \u201cHmm, it's a start\u201d I replied. After some further discussion, I was eventually shown to Room 0901 by Ruben which was equally pleasant but could now crucially happily accommodate my single case which was no longer relegated and confined to the floor. This still left the pool facility to reconcile even though I now accepted it's loss was unavoidable. I decided to provisionally accept the room and my luggage was duly guided to it's new home in my absence as by this time, I had pottered off for a walk in the rain to ponder my next move. It was late by now and thoughts of moving were as unwelcome as the discovery of the pole-axed pool so whilst out, I made the decision to sleep on it leaving just the two nights to fill, if I had to! I arrived back a little soggy but lighter in mood nonetheless to find a handwritten \u201cI'm Sorry\u201d card from The Q Team and a small soft toy Crocodile (which I still have by my desk as I write this!) on my bed hoping that, \u201cI enjoy my new hotels swimming pool\u201d. Well I never, how unexpected! Such thoughtfulness really was surprising, especially after my honesty, big brownie points here folks, other Hotel's please take note! After a pleasant nights sleep, I concluded that as there were only 2 nights left in Singapore, negotiating with a different hotel would have simply consumed to much time therefore, I would stay for the duration and make the best of it, pool or no pool. As I've rambled on a little, let me try and detail more specifically the strengths and weaknesses of the Quincy, sorry it's taken so long to get to the point...LOL! Location is OK but getting to Orchard Road is kinda convoluted, fastest route walking being through another hotel which may not be too everyone's liking also, if your not a regular walker, then it's best to be aware that you may have problems with the steepness of the local roads, especially in the rain. As I'm sure you already know, The Quincy is an all-inclusive Hotel, meaning that your breakfast, lunch and dinner are included within your room rate. This was a new experience for me and overall worked well but, there are some important considerations to bare in mind. The set meal times are just that, set so deviation is difficult. The Menu is also rather limited and repetitive I believe having spoken to other guests. Overall however, I found it perfectly adequate as indeed were the drinks on offer; i.e. drawn beers rather than bottles, house wine and the necessary soft alternatives although it must be said, service could be inconsistent at times ranging from good to poor. More specifically, as regards the menu, there were also a couple of issues concerning what was and was not possible. Example 1. I asked for an item not on the menu (there's always one I know!), plain potatoes instead of the spicy potato wedges on offer as they simply overpowered the very nice steak I was trying to enjoy. This request was graciously agreed to so, loads more brownie points! Example 2. I then asked for a bottle of red wine with some 20 minutes still remaining in the window for ordering and was denied. After an interesting discussion with the Ma\u00eetre De and unwilling to be thwarted, I offered to pay what was required regardless; not a happy bunny and nothing whatsoever to do with the money! What makes this last example even more confusing and annoying is that when reviewing my final bill, I don't think they actually charged me for the wine in which case, why create such unnecessary bad feeling when there was no reason to? For the record; whilst never previously a fan of the \u201call-inclusive\u201d, the Quincy came out very respectfully, a little more flexibility would make it even better though, if that's possible with an all-inclusive. Finally as I am not a stranger to Customer Service in my own business, I would specifically like to mention and commend Ruben, whose input I found particularly focused and constructive, so much so that I was minded to show my appreciation in a more practical manner other than this review, my sincere thanks. And thank you for your company. If you do ever make it to Singapore, give the Quincy a go and don't forget to let me know how the pool was, maybe one day I'll return for a quick dip, who knows?

I am a seasoned business traveller and have been to Singapore many times. Have stayed at most 5-star hotels, and decided to stay at a boutique hotel this time for a change. - Draconian penalty for smoking - terrible Food - Limited room service, closes at 10pm - Small room - Pathetic mini bar - TV channels limited - Small pool with limited sun - Nice small gym I was shocked when I was told to sign a statement during check-in that I would be charged one night rate's as a penalty if they found traces of smoking in the room as a \"cleaning fee\". WHAT? I was not told during booking online, even though I fully understood that this is a non-smoking hotel. If I had, I wouldn't have booked this hotel. What if a friend of mine decided to smoke without my knowledge when I was out? Usually in five -star hotels, all you would get is a friendly reminder about it. I refused to sign it, since I had not been told. When I said I would go to the Hyatt, they said they would charge me a night's penalty for cancelling. The point here is that they didn't inform me about this \"extra', and outrageously high cleaning fee during booking, not that I am a chain smoker! they wouldn't let me check in unless I sign that statement. 2 managers came out and finally one of them said it's ok to smoke as long as I didn't burn the room down. Have never heard of any rule like this anywhere in the world. Food is absolutely awful. The breakfast is a meagre buffet, with very few choices of food. Everything that's available is oily and processed and unhealthy. The \"omelete\" is flat and oily. The bacon is soggy and soft. The cheesse is cheap processed cheese. The coffee, oh the coffee, it \"self serviced\" - 2 office canteen type machine for you to choose from. I asked for scrambled eggs, and it came back as over-cooked lumps of egg. I dare not try their lunch nor dinner after my first breakfast. They really need to train their kitchen staff. AND room service closes at 10pm??????? the problem is the hotel is a about a 10 minute walk to the nearest 7-Eleven. so after 10pm - good luck if you are hungry. The room is small - definitely NOT a studio. It has space for only one bed, and a small desk right in front of the TV. storage is very limited. The bathroom is super nice though. I got a bigger room with a bath tub. The bed is very comfortable. The unlimited mini-bar: you get 2 cans of beer, pepsi, pepsi light, and some water plus some local juice. Half the channels on my TV didn't work. The Internet is rather fast, compared to other hotels. The Pool... nice pool. small. but it's covered and you won't get any sun until late afternoon. The gym is small but adequate. The steam and sauna is co-ed and never turned on. Honestly speaking, I do not believe this is very good value for money. free wifi, free limo, free laundry and free crap food and mini bar.... I would rather they charge everything separately. Late check in - \"oh our hotel is very full today, but if you are willing to pay s$20 per hour, we won't be that full.\" I am very used to the Asian hospitality style, and this hotel is not even on par with any 4, 5 star hotels.

The buffet breakfast was same as any big hotel, cold food, hot food, good coffee, pastries, eggs. In the lobby there are free mac stations for use which was handy. But most of all the staff at this hotel were so helpful and friendly. We forgot our phone charger and they were happy to charge our phone every morning. We wanted restaurant recommendations and they looked them up. We needed to get to a friends house and they printed off a map for the taxi driver. I would stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it. This was my first time in a boutique hotel, we always stay in the 5 star big chains, but never again. The service and rooms at the Quincy has made me think twice about the big chains. .", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BondiAustralia", "Title": "\u201cNothing needed\u201d", "Author": "TimmyTonsil", "ReviewID": "UR67418353", "Content": "Great Hotel and that all inclusive deal was great in the arvo after a long day shopping and sight seeing to have a drink and meal in the lobby was great.

For S$298 (only available for Singaporeans and PRs) we also had free meals - Buffet breakfast, Set lunch and dinner, late checkout till 3 pm, complimentary minibar, internet and local calls. Quincy Hotel is wonderfully designed, sleek, chic, with lots of black and silver. Interestingly it shares its driveway and carpark with the neighbouring Elizabeth Hotel, same management perhaps, and its main entrance is via access-card only, so that makes it feel more 'exclusive'. Check in (at 2pm) was a breeze. There were Macs with high-speed internet right at the lobby and my partner could easily check his credit card account balance there before paying for the room. Our room was average-sized, on par to other 4/5* hotel rooms we've been to locally. Large king-sized bed with white plushy cushions, a huge flat-screen TV which got my partner very excited, huge windows looking out to the rest of the city.. My partner had no problems setting up his Macbook wireless internet access and PS3 (yes he had brought his PS3!) to the TV. I loved the Molton Brown toiletries, but took a little while to figure out how to work the shower, and got drenched in doing so. The shower has both an overhead 'rain' shower head and a hand-held shower head but I did not notice the former and stepped in fully-clothed and yeah, got drenched with icy cold water. My bad. The hot water supply here is plentiful, and I had a nice steaming hot bath in the bathtub after that silly faux paus. The minibar contains soft drinks and beer and there's a cup of cup noodles and some chips too. Dinner was Risotto for me and Sirloin steak for my partner. There was free flow of house pours, wine and beer too. Food was not bad, nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. Service was very efficient, and our meal was quite a quiet peaceful fuss-free affair. Later that night we headed to the 12th floor where the Gym, Pool, Steam-room and Sauna were. There was nobody there! We made ourselves at home in the Steam-room but it took too long to reach satisfactory steam levels, so we headed to the Sauna which was in local terms, simply \"SHIOK!\". The pool was beautiful under the night sky, but it was too cold to stay in for long. Had a comfortable sleep but my partner complained that the air-conditioning controls were not working and he had a rough night as a result. He said that the temperature on the control kept on changing, sometimes at 18 degrees, sometimes at 26, when all he wanted was a 22. I can't really comment, because I had slept throughout. :p Oh and by the way Quincy Hotel is a non-smoking hotel. My partner had to travel all the way to the ground floor outside the lobby to have a smoke. That must have been particularly troublesome, especially if you had wanted a smoke in the dead of the night. Breakfast was buffet-style. I had hashbrowns (very cripsy, the way I like it), a big bowl of fruit yoghurt, some cheese, a very good cup of Latte Macchiato, cocoa pops, sausages, etc. Lunch was Seafood Fried Rice for me and Spaghetti Bolognese for my partner. Again, nothing to complain about the meal. The gym is quite wonderful in my opinion. Its chic and sleek, and has a bountiful supply of white fluffy towels and bottled water. The machines are in great condition, and I had a refreshing morning run looking out at the city. A pity no one seems to use the facilities here, because I was the only one in the gym throughout the morning. Orchard Road was a 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel - something that I did not like really because it was drizzling and I was wearing heels. Apart from that, I think my stay at Quincy Hotel has been pretty wonderful. The staff here are warm and friendly and will share a joke with you occasionally.

Unfortunately when I arrived at the Quincy, at 7 am after a long flight from Europe, I was informed at reception that my daughter was not included in the all-inclusive package so I would either have to pay extra for her mels and drinks or eat elsewhere with her. of course niether is an attractive option - eating in 2 places each time and no child portions and overpriced food in the Quincy. Plus, I thought I had book all inclusive ofr both of us. The receptionist claimed - wait for it - that it was open to interpretation!!!!!! Not to me it wasn't - a deal is a deal. Nothing on the website or booking confirmation had indicated that one person was all inclusive and 1 person wasn't. It was bizarre. I do not know if this is a case of a toxic receptionist or if there is a policy of getting reception staff to look for ways of charging guetss for extras, but I have never felt so excluded from a hotel in all my life. The receptionist the claimed that a child was only up to 3 years old! Later, other staff I had to argue with claimed a child was up to 4 years old! Again, who has heard of that? A child is normally up to 11, 12 or 16 but 3 or 4? A baby is up to 1 or 2 so what is a 3 or 4 year old? I finally got my daughter included in the all inclusive but byy now it felt like they were doing me a favour. it is a good thing my daughter is so young she did not understand any of this. Later in the day, I went to eat in the hotel restaurant and the receptionist had ''neglected'' to tell the other hotel staff my daughter was included in the all inclusive package. Again, this confirmed my suspicions about what the hotel claims via booking and what it will deliver once you arrive. So I had to argue my case again with a new set of staff and by this time I was really not happy. Dinner ruined. I would advise anyone thinking of going to the Quincy with children to check with the hotel on what their definition of children is and who is included in the meal plan before booking. i can not understand why a hotel trying to establish itself would lose a customer in the first 5 minutes like this. I would also just go to one of the more established hotels near the Quincy and just go bed and breakfast that way you know where you stand. Cocktails are just vodka, gin or whisky with a mixer. Pool is really cold as it is high up. Quincy is a nicely designed hotel but I really did not enjoy it - see above. Also, early check-in is 140 singapore dollars (half as much again) so that can make your night at the Quincy very expensive, or you wait around until 2 pm!

We booked a package deal through expedia that included mercedes transfer from the airport, all meals, evening cocktails, mini bar and internet for about $220 USD. What we didn't expect was the most gracious service (including 2 pieces of laundry per night) and good food. Who goes to Singapore for free food? Singapore is the capitol of delicious, diverse fare. But the lobby restaurant changed their menu daily and cooked a la carte dinners to order. The staff were amazingly friendly, helpful and cooperative. Traveling with a 2 year old and a 4 month old has been challenging, but the staff at the Quincy made it so easy - from arranging the cots promptly, to supplying us with milk so that we would not have to walk to the nearest 7 eleven, to making the rambunctious toddler laugh. The hotel is conveniently located up a short hill from Orchard road (right behind Paragon and Takashimaya) but the street is quiet and tree lined. The lobby has 2 mac desktops for you to use while waiting for a taxi. Concierge exceedingly helpful printing maps, timetables, etc Rooms are modern, clean, cheerful with Moulton Brown products.

The room: As has been mentioned; the rooms are on the 'tight' size but have been cleverly designed with loads of mirrors and light so it works well. The bathroom is a good size and includes a bath and shower (with great pressure). Molton Brown toiletries always very welcome!. The pool: Once you've found it (12th floor - no indication in lift) it's very cool if a little scary if you are scared of heights. The perrfect place to chill for an hour or so. Gym: Well laid out with decent equipment. Free Mini-bar: Now, if you are expecting a European style mini-bar, think again. It's stocked with some weird (and possibly wonderful) stuff that you won't have come across before. IMO, the only 'useful' stuf was the TWO beers and I gave the soya drinks and stuff a miss. All-Inclusive aspect: A/I does not mean free; you've paid for it so don't think it's a gift. If you are there for a couple of days then it's OK but when in Singapore, I'd rather eat locally. It was OK but the breakfast was a bit disappointing with nasty OJ. Free Broadband: GREAT! Singapore was a 'mare for internet and it felt distinctly 1990's.

We had booked a room based on the good TripAdvisor reviews and ended up pretty happy about our stay. In general, the \"all inclusive\" proved very comfortable. No thought to give, all is in: we were picked up by a very friendly limo driver at the airport and transported through the city. During the trip we got a first glance of Singapore with some explanations from the driver and a free map to go around later. Arriving to the hotel, we were checked in a very professional (but a little bit cold?) manner. Early check-in was unfortunately only possible against an extra 100 SGD. Not really willing to go for the extra, we dropped our luggage and started our city tour. We returned around 2 PM and were shown to our room by a very friendly concierge who chatted with us on the way up, asked whether we needed any help with tour arrangements (he offered to look up transport schedules to the zoo for us) and later introduced all aspects of the \"package\": included meals, mini-bars, 2 pcs of laundry, cocktail hour, swimming pool, gym, etc. A word of caution though: Unfortunately the transport schedule for the zoo was incorrect, and taking the shuttle bus to the zoo is anyway a really bad idea unless you are on a very tight budget. The bus took about 1 hour, since it picked up guest from loads of hotels before actually going to the zoo itself. The bus costs 4 dollars per person, and a taxi cost us less than 20 dollars and took only 20 minutes! The room itself was nice and modern, having both a rain shower and a bathtub, some good amenities and a very comfy mattress - we slept like in heaven. After a short rest, back to town and shopping, which was quick as the location is ideal for shopping: 5 minutes down the road brings you to Palagon, one of the shopping centers on Orchard Road. We also had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel, which was convenient. Opening hours are quite extensive (6:30-10:00 for breakfast, 11:30-14:30 for lunch, 18:30-22:00 for dinner). Food was decent, not really Michelin-style but good solid dishes (lots of Italian style pasta dishes, burgers, etc) of reasonable teanure. For drinks, you can pick between an outstanding buffet of fresh fruit juices, a vast choice of soft drinks and some wines (or liquor in the evening from 6 to 8 PM). We liked our meals but I can understand the other comments mentioning that you can get bored of the food or worry for your cholesterol if you stay there a longer period. Summary: Like's: all inclusive concept, excellent rooms and bedding, friendly concierge, beautiful pool with glass walls overlooking the city, stylish design inside the hotel Dislike's: the extra charge for early check-in Overall, I'd definitely recommend the Quincy and would not hesitate to get back on a next trip to Singapore (amazing shopping location...!!!). If we had known how nice Singapore actually was, we would have stayed a few more nights instead of just a short stop over.

A beautiful and unique pool to swim mid afternoon as the sun is setting. The Service at the hotel by the office and room service was exceptional, and 5 star...except for the restaurant staff. If you consider that for the Quincy to provide good value for money in Singapore one does need to have about 2 meals at the hotel, then one would spend the most time with the restaurant staff... yet for some reason it appears that the hotel decided it wasn't important to hire staff with smiles. Having just arrived from The Hilton in Kuala Lumpur for 5 days, I can say that there the Quincy restaurant staff was far below subpar in comparison. The range of foods is much better than school canteen food as other reviewers have said, and indeed not all oily - with a healthy mix of fruit and vegetables. But if you're looking for a gastronomic tour of Singapore you wouldn't stay at the hotel for every meal of your 4 day stay, which in a long winded way gets me to my point; this is a great hotel for single travelers or couples, on short stays, and will only provide value for money if you eat at the restaurant for most of the meals on your stay.

Firstly, planing a 3 days trip to Singapore, we were trying to make our choice between the executive floor of the Hilton Singapore, PanPacific Orchard, Swissotel Merchant Court, Intercontinental Singapore or in Quincy Hotel. All of them are in same price basket and we just tried to find just better service. Wrong list! The level of service of Quincy is not even remotely close to standard of Hilton or Intercontinental or any other reputable international chain! And they are too huge and too understaffed to provide any personal touch as it supposed to be in \u201cboutique hotel\u201d (as they proclaimed itself) The advertised concept of \u201call inclusive\u201d is also very confusing. Normally, most of us do not consider a collection of soy milk cans and other cheap soft drinks as a standard mini-bar. There is absolutely no alcohol in \u201cfree minibar\u201d! Not a big deal for us by itself, just a disappointment. The inclusive breakfast was a disappointment as well \u2013 the selection of food is very limited. Dinner and lunch were not much better \u2013 the same garnish for all dishes and piece of fish or meat. Evening cocktail consist of three drinks \u2013 wine \u201cwhite or red?\u201d and \u201cbeer\u201d. It\u2019s just shame to offer such food in city with great culinary reputation The most problematic area was a size of the room \u2013 never in my life I stayed in such small rooms. They are small, and I mean it! And there is defiantly something wrong with plumbing \u2013 the noise in the pipes is close to the level to working vacuum cleaner. The staff are polite but rather inattentive. Even finding a taxi could be a problematic. And the waiting staff in restaurant probably the most unsmiling waiting staff I ever seen.

Initially, the hotel's online booking engine was not working, so I tried contact by email. After a few hours, the web engine was restored, and I made my booking directly. Just after booking through the web, I received a reply to my email with an offer for S$10 less. Too late. Too bad. The limo pick-up idea is nice, but pointless. Singapore has excellent public transportation options including: MRT (subway), bus, taxi, and limo, all available on demand at the airport. Taking the hotel limo required a special call to the hotel to confirm my flight details (more than 48 hours in advance), arriving at the airport and hunting for the limo driver (since there are multiple exits from the baggage claim area), then following him downstairs and waiting ~10 minutes for him to bring his car over (in Terminal 1). I could have just walked straight out of baggage claim directly into one of the waiting limos and paid ~S$35 without any waiting required. Why doesn't Quincy just provide the limo as an option and reduce their hotel rate? It's silly to pay for some guy to stand at the airport with a sign when there are plenty of the same cars waiting for on demand passengers. I arrived at the hotel to discover that the pool was under maintenance and not available. Too bad, since that's a showcase item at the hotel. In fact, not only was the pool under maintenance, but so was my room. The closet light didn't work, and an access panel was open on the ceiling. The air conditioning was permanently set to \"freeze,\" so my only option was to completely switch off the fan if I didn't want blue fingers. The room layout is decent, and the decoration is suitably modern, but the size of the room is tiny for Singapore standards. Clearly the window through to the bathroom was included to make the room feel bigger without actually occupying more space. The toilet flush capacity in my room was very limited. Both the small and big flush buttons resulted in the same amount of water being released from the tank into the bowl. The shower (like nearly all showers in Singapore hotels) is poorly designed from the perspective of water leakage and usability. The door swings either in or out, and it's almost impossible to stand inside the shower and swing the door due to the limited space available. Swinging the door out results in covering half the bathroom floor with water. The shower has a funky amenities shelf that is virtually useless for holding the supplied mini bottles of Molton Brown shampoo/conditioner/etc.. The shelf is more like a flat grating that has been bent into a U-shape, but because the bottom is not solid, the bottles can't stand up straight and end up falling on the floor. The (small) rainshower is nice, but the water spray doesn't work well at distributing the water over a large area. Due to the limited space, only one person could reasonably use the bathroom at a time. Minor issues, but these are things that should have been noticed when designing and building the rooms. The hotel room's TV is wide screen, but since none of the channels offered on the hotel TV system are HD or 16:9 format, all the images are stretched. Why aren't any Singapore hotels offering HD? Singtel and Starhub both have HD channels now. If they aren't doing HD, there could at least be an option on the remote control to change the aspect ratio of the screen to 4:3 so everything doesn't look squashed/fat. I didn't bother with the included dinner or drinks. The hotel's website and staff seem to make a big deal out of the \"all inclusive\" package, but I just don't get it. If this hotel is targeted at business travelers, why offer those meals? I always have business lunches and dinners when I travel, and I rarely have time to take advantage of cocktails at the hotel. The all inclusive aspect of the hotel is not much more than a typical club or executive floor gets you at a larger hotel, and since everyone at the Quincy is essentially on the \"club floor\" it loses the privacy and exclusivity that is typical of such floors. Yes, the minibar is included, but this is quite typical in Singapore, and the minibar is actually no better than a drink machine in the hallway (no snacks/candy/liquor). Breakfast was O-K. Honestly, I wasn't impressed. Nothing is available to order, and there was no coffee offered. I had to go hunt for a mug and use the coffee machine myself to pour a cup. The fresh fruit selection truly failed for Singapore. There were apples and some old papaya. Besides all those points, which are things I have learned to live with at other hotels, the clincher came at the end of my stay. When I arrived at the hotel, I told the manager who showed me to my room that this was my first stay at Quincy, since I normally stay at the Naumi hotel, but they were fully booked this time. I indicated that I was giving this place a try as a possible venue for our company during CommunicAsia (a big expo in the summer every year). This was a not so subtle hint that I expected things to go well during my one night stay. Unfortunately, I doubt this was communicated to anyone else, or if it was, they just didn't care. After my breakfast, I had a 10:30 AM meeting. I also had a 12:30 PM meeting/lunch. My flight out of Singapore was at 4:30 PM. I could: (a) shave and go to my first meeting then return to the hotel around 2:00 PM to pack and check out, or (b) no shave but pack everything and get out of the hotel ASAP. I called the front desk to request a late checkout at 2:30 PM. After some deliberation with a computer or person, the front desk told me that they could give me the late checkout, but I would have to pay a late checkout charge. I explained that I could not accept a late checkout charge due to company policy, so that wouldn't work for me, and I asked why they needed to charge me. The clerk informed me that because the hotel was very full over the weekend, they needed the rooms back earlier for new guests. Think about that for a minute. Why would paying a late checkout fee have anything to do with making room for other guests? How would me paying a late checkout fee create a new room for the people arriving later? This was just a poor excuse to try to extract more money from me. After I explained my situation (I needed to go to a meeting now, and I didn't have time to pack everything) and schedule to the clerk, she told me that I could keep the room until 1 PM. Obviously, if I was having a meeting at 12:30 PM, keeping the room only until 1 PM would be useless. She then asked if I needed the room or just a shower. Hello? Was I talking to a wall? Here I am, a first time guest who normally stays at other hotels in Singapore. I'm a business traveler, and many frequent business travelers need late checkouts. I expected better from a new hotel trying to attract more customers. This attitude to try to extract more money from a new guest asking for a late checkout without paying any attention to my situation was very poor form. I won't be staying at the Quincy again, and neither will my colleagues. I will gladly go back to the Naumi (a much smaller boutique hotel with only suites and much more personal service).

We like to think of ourselves as well travelled. We usually travel overseas 2 to 3 times per year and have stayed at countless Luxury hotels - None however like this gem. I will not try and double up on the countless positive (and accurate) reviews on here, rather give some more precise info to help you in your Choice. Firstly let me say the reason for our trip was our Honeymoon, so finding something special was important. Thanks to my research on Trip Advisor the Quincy was just that. We arrived into SIN at Midnight and were met by our well dressed complimentary Limo driver who shook my hand and congratulated us on our wedding. Whilst en-route to our hotel (and giving us a very informative narration along the way) he contacted the hotel to inform them of our arrival. When we pulled up, staff were waiting at the door (1am mind you) to give us a warm welcome. After a fast, friendly check in, we were escorted to our room. Our Room....where do I begin. BEAUTIFUL. IMMACUALTE & MODERN. Too much to say but a nice size, comfy bed and all the mod cons of a 5 star hotel (even though this isn't)...and yes FREE MINI BAR. Now the mini bar is a small fridge consisting of juice, soft drinks and beer (no spirits) but hey...how many hotels provide this for free? Toiletries provided were top shelf and replenished every day. The GYM. As regular gym nuts the equipment was high quality. 3 x New Gym quality Treadmills with LCD TV screens. Exercise bikes and Elliptical machines, new gym quality weights and weight stations...everything you need for a quality workout - overlooking the... MAGNIFICENT POOL....amazing. Located on the 12 floor this pool really does 'jet out' from the building. The walls are glass so the view of the city (even underwater) amazing - even more special at night...and as expected immaculately clean. The Sauna and Steam rooms also clean and both function well. My only negatives for this area (hey this is an unbiased review) - you have to turn on Sauna/Steam when u want to use (approx 30 mins warm up...but I understand reasons why) - Music in the gym would be nice (a little too quiet) - Area is unsupervised which is no problem, but the only phone on floor (in case of emergency) is not working. DOWNSTAIRS DINING AND HAPPY HOUR. I will start with the \u2018Happy hour\u2019 6 \u2013 8 pm every night. FREE\u2026that\u2019s right FREE drinks. Have to say, someone needs to teach the staff how to pour drinks. Bennie and the guys really do serve it up. Firstly, the beer. Tiger Beer on tap served in a Chilled glass (or jug if thirsty). Spirits \u2013 hmmm this is where they need to learn (and I mean this in a good way). Normally when you ask for a drink (especially when free) you would think they would be a \u2018little tight\u2019 on the serving size. These guys serve the biggest pours (glass is over half full of scotch / vodka etc). You add your own free mixer. These are the STONGEST drinks I have had\u2026amazing. Red and white wine is Italian and is quite nice. I was expecting the service to be a little slow to limit drinking, but was pleasantly surprised at the speed and friendliness of staff. WELL DONE GUYS. BREAKFAST \u2013 unlike some buffet Breakfast\u2019s the menu is changed daily. Food was excellent and good selection. Eggs cooked to order also available. I am a very fussy coffee drinker, but the coffee beans and machine used does make one great Espresso. LUNCH & DINNER \u2013 Now we purposely avoided the free meals here for the sole reason we wanted to get out and have the Local Food. We had a late checkout (1800 hrs) which I will add was complimentary due to our honeymoon. Due to the time, management offered us Dinner and Drinks before departure which we gladly accepted (rather than airline food). Again the Lunch and Dinner menu\u2019s are changed daily. I am so glad we did not eat here until the last day. The food was absolutely DELICIOUS. Had we\u2019ve eaten here on the first night we would not have left the hotel. I had the Mee Goreng \u2013 which was as good as any I have had. More importantly, my wife felt like a steak and chose the Sirloin. Now, being Australian we are spoilt for quality beef and have high expectations. My wife\u2019s steak was THE BEST she had ever eaten, cooked to perfection. Beware \u2013 don\u2019t eat dinner here too early in your trip or you will be hooked. Yes\u2026all your meals are FREE. STAFF \u2013 what can I say\u2026exceptional. It would be so hard and unfair to single out any one staff member. I am not sure whether the fact we were honeymooners made a difference \u2013 all guests seemed to receive the same service. EXTRA\u2019S \u2013 2 free pieces of Laundry per day. Internet free and no problems with the connection. The only thing the hotel lacks is room service (which is probably why not 5 star). Having said that, room service was not high on our list (never is) but if it is a priority then you would be Stupid to overlook this hotel for that reason. CONCLUSION \u2013 We truly had an exceptional honeymoon thanks to this amazing property. I am concerned (like many) that we may not be able to return once the popularity of the Quincy increases. From a selfish point of view, I hope it doesn\u2019t. I found this property thanks to Trip Advisor. I have been disappointed so many times before with Hotels in Singapore (more expensive too). The Quincy will always get my business.

It was a great experience for both of us. We didn't use the limousine, a service that I was impressed to hear of and certainly worthy of mention, as I secured our stay by other means. And yea, all meals provided is a great bonus. Our first impression was that security to the hotel is very tight and this was comforting. Only guests who have a card can enter the lobby. The lobby encompasses lots of glass to make up for its narrow design. Upon entering the lift, you could say we were pretty impressed by its modern and new feel. We were pleasantly surprised when told by the staff that the hotel was only less than 20 days old. The vibes that we got in the lift was reflected in the room interior. There was lots of glass used. Interestingly, the toilet which was seperated from the room by a mirror-like glass panel was hidden when the lights in the toilet were out but fully visible when we hit the on switch. We liked it that the door to the closet doubled as the toilet door too. The desk stood right below the TV along with a convenient panel for TV connectivity sandwiched in between. Complimentary mini-bar drinks always help. One minus is that air-con is centrally controlled, which turned out to be a pain at night 'cos it got pretty hot. Location-wise, we can't say it was very close to go to Orchard Road. It's probably better to cross the adjacent hotel to access Far East Plaza on Scotts Road. For other hotel amenities, we'd have to say the swimming pool floor is amazing. This was probably the first pool we tried that has a glass panel to allow swimmers to look a vertigo-inducing 12 floors below. It's great that one could look out at the vicinity while having a swim. The sauna and gym facilities were located on the same floor too. For parking, Quincy doesn't have any space but it does share the lots with the adjacent The Elizabeth Hotel. In terms of value, the experience is something one would probably want to try at least once. The price is a little on steep but once you consider the limousine pickup/complimentary meals/ultra modern facilities/exclusiveness, you realize it's fantastic value.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel for solo traveller\u201d", "Author": "Petal86", "ReviewID": "UR46504007", "Content": "This is a new hotel with friendly staff.

A couple of days before, I called the hotel and Franck (I didn't know he's the manager until I read the reviews) was on the line, I informed him that I had arranged a floral delivery to the hotel, for my wife as a surprise. I was afraid that the flowers will arrive before we check in so this is just a heads up. Franck said it will be all taken care of. On the day of check in, my wife and I were served by friendly Nathan who showed us to our room. On the way up to level 13, I noticed the hotel's minimalist decor style which is what I like. The room was, as expected, tastefully done up with a pretty good view. Nathan briefed us on the room amenities and hotel facilities. He then picked up a card standing on the bed and handed it to us. It was a \"Happy Anniversary\" card from the Q team, it even contained a caricature of both my wife and I. Thanks to Franck and team for the thoughtfulness. The flowers did not arrive by the time we left the hotel at about 5.30 pm for some shopping at Orchard road. We returned for dinner at about 7.30 pm. I excused myself to check with Nathan about the floral delivery and he told me with a cheeky grin that the flowers are already in the room. Needless to say, the wife was pleasantly delighted to receive the flowers. I had always wondered if the hotel staff deliberately kept the flowers until we left the room before sneaking them in so as to create the surprise element for my wife. Whichever the case, I could not have arranged that better, it was exactly how I wanted and Quincy's staff seemed to have read my mind. We had a short but great weekend at Quincy, the service was impeccable deserving of a 5-star rating. Kudos to Franck and your great team.

I've rarely stayed at the same place twice, and I dread every new venue as my experiences have been invariably lacking. The Gallery tried the funky minimalist hotel concept and failed miserably. Most other hotels in Singapore are overpriced and/or tired. The Quincy, however, manages to be edgy and funky while still being extremely comfortable, friendly and reasonable value for money. The all-inclusive concept has its pluses and minuses: On the upside, the free internet, breakfast, one way airport transfer and plentiful bottled water and soft drinks in the rooms is fantastic. On the downside, I think the lunch offering is the weak link - carb, carb and more carb. Cheap and easy high volume food (although freshly prepared) rather than high quality or healthy. The fact that it's free makes me hesitant to criticise too strongly, but in this one area I think you get what you pay for. The rest of the hotel, however, exceeds expectations. What really clinches the deal for me at the Quincy is the high quality room amenity and the fantastic service. The rooms are small but incredibly well designed and very comfortable. The bathrooms are well appointed - fair to say luxuriously appointed - and the beds are far more comfortable than the usual Singaporean Slab. The shower is luxurious with hand-held and overhead rain shower options, while the bath is deep and long enough to enjoy a soak, complete with speaker and glass wall for those who want to watch TV while they relax in the tub (there's a privacy shade for those who don't). The blackout shades on the external window are fantastic (especially after a red-eye flight) and the bathrobes/towels/linen are all high quality. Good digital climate control, wall-mounted flat screen television and very fast (free) internet complete the package. The staff are cheeky and fun, and most impressively they seem to remember and genuinely like the guests. Frances has been a particular standout for me on both of my recent trips, although all the staff have been terrific. The Quincy would benefit from a loyalty program so that things like late check-out can be extended as a matter of course to frequent guests rather than only to those who stay for three days or longer, but may only be one-time visitors. I've negotiated late check out for both of my stays, but I hate having to do that when other hotels extend it to me as a matter of course due to my status with most major hotel chains.

Miyuki came to my room to hook up my laptop to the large screen TV and showed me how I could legally watch movies from the internet. Reuben brought excellent movies from his own personal collection to help me pass the time. When I was too weak to come down for breakfast, it was brought to me by Bene or his staff. Bene even came up with a specialized menu for me based on the dietary restrictions subsequent to surgery including supplying special food and drinks for my fridge. Suresh made sure my medical documents were scanned properly and quickly. Suresh and Chau helped me to mail boxes since I couldn't lift anything.

Also allthough it may have nothing to do with the hotel, having arived late evening from the UK, I slept like a baby, and the next night etc. it's never happened for me before to sleep that well with a 7 hour time change.

Location: Okay, so you would understand better where I\u2019m coming from, I normally stay at the Grand Hyatt and one time I stayed at the Meritus Mandarin, which were both very close to Orchard Road, you won\u2019t even have to count 100 steps. Although Quincy is still within the Orchard area, it\u2019s a good 7-10 minute walk from Paragon, and in the searing Singapore heat (or wet monsoon rains) it makes a lot of difference. Check-in: Was very fast, someone even brought me up to the room, to show me how things work, and where things are located. Room: was standard, in fact if you are with someone, you might feel a bit cramped because there is no place for your luggage, I like the use of space, but somehow I wish there was a little bit more to move around. Bathroom: The bathroom was standard although be careful with the hot water on the showers since it could get very very hot.\u2026the Molton Brown toiletries did give a nice touch. Bed: Bed was quite comfortable and the pillows were a mix of synthetic and down feather plus the duvet were very comfortable. Breakfast: was standard hotel breakfast, nothing much to write about. Lunch: I was able to have lunch once, the fried rice was quite nice, better than what I was expecting actually\u2026unlimited sodas and juices plus you can also help yourself to the salad bar. Dinner: quite unfortunate that I missed dinner on both nights that I was there so I couldn\u2019t write anything about that. Check-out: Check out was fast and efficient, nothing much to write about that. Overall Evaluation: Service is excellent, I guess if you will compare it with the bigger hotels, the service at Quincy is definitely warmer. It\u2019s also pretty affordable especially if you take into consideration the Mercedes Transfers which is about 50SGD, laundry plus the lunch and dinners, it\u2019s gonna come out very cheap.

Even though this was my first visit the staff greeted me like I was a long term friend, a really energetic vibe that I've not encountered in any hotel anywhere else in the world. I've never stayed at a hotel that is all inclusive and I've got to be honest and say that I was sceptical at the time of booking. I thought the meals would be tiny and unappetising for a start. Thankfully, not the case at all. The menu is generous, the servings the same and the food is more than enjoyable. The wines served at happy hour were also of a good quality. Breakfast was also good with great coffee! I broke my neck to get back to the hotel for every meal! The rooms are a good size and are very comfortable. The only criticisms I have are that the pillows are a little firm and the absence of a clock in the room was also intriguing (I'm sure there's some sort of philosophy behind this omission...). The mini bar fridge could also be a bit colder so that you can fully enjoy the complimentary beverages... Vaguely cool drinks are not the greatest after braving the humidity outside. The swimming pool deck was also very enjoyable, I really dug swimming in a glass pool on the 12th floor! Very unique like everything about this hotel! The value that this hotel represents is nothing short of amazing, the rate inlcuded all meals, mini bar, two pieces of laundry each day, limo pick up at the airport in a shiny new E Class Mercedes, free wifi access, happy hour cocktails and free tea and coffee all day.

I now understand what it was all about, not only I discover a good website with a lot of hotel reviews, but I now also get why this lady kept saying \"it is so unfair\". I read the review called Buyer beware as well as the other two, which are in all fairness very good. Before I give my feedback, I have to say that Raymond must be a flea market addict as I would never categorized this hotel as such. In fact, it is modern, excellent staff, very practical rooms, there is all you need for when you travel. The lobby looks gorgeous, it is not a big hotel so do not expect big rooms, big restaurant. The concept there is like athome, you help yourself at the buffet, you press for your desired coffee (free all day long), itis convenient, easy, you do not need to wait for anything.

At this price, you get a room only anywhere else in Singapore, especially in this part of town. It is off Orchard road, ok 6 minutes walk but when you reach the hotel, it is so quiet and peaceful, and the hotel is reserved to hotel guests, making it very private. If I have the chance tomorrow, I will speak to this couple and tell them what I did and if I see the caucasian gentleman tomorrow I will also tell him that I rate the hotel highly and in all fairness, they are trying so hard to make you feel special.
