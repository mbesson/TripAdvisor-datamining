The bathroom is also very clean stylish with bath tub and shower, the shower is closed by red glass and similarly the toilet/WC is hidden behind another semitransparent red glass wall inside the bathroom itself. sleep quality is excellent. Breakfast is in the main restaurant room with fairly large choice. Free wireless internet is available only in the lobby, only for 30min and it does NOT support VPN, hence it is almost useless for a business traveller and I do not consider this as \"free internet available\", which in my opinion is \"free internet available\" only if 24h and in room. The hotel is located at 10min from Les Corts metro station, which is on the green line at 10min from Placa de Espanya, very good! As I stayed during the peak Mobile World Congress event, the price was outrageous...", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cNo good at all\u201d", "Author": "L-Cay", "ReviewID": "UR73865390", "Content": "No 4 stars hotel at all! Facilities were dated and the service was terrible. At first we got a room that wasn\u00b4t cleaned at all after the prior guest. Second room was okey. Later on we asked the receptionstaff for ice-cubes and they just laughed and told us to go to the supermarket. Pool area was small and crowded, the spa-staff was rude and the gym had very limited openinghours. Our flight was delayed and we asked for a late-checkout. The reception told us that would cost us 10 euro per hour extra. The only, and I really meen the only, good thing was the breakfast. The restaurantstaff was very serviceminded and the choice of food was excellent. Everything else about this hotel was really bad. Stay at some other place.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFair value for the money\u201d", "Author": "torontotraveller7", "ReviewID": "UR33156139", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Costanza with a girlfriend in June of 2009. The location is great - walking distance to good shopping, dining and sightseeing - and there is easy access to public transit. The room was attractively decorated and had a lovely shower. A large balcony with seating was also a plus, although it did overlook a daycare playground so there were noise issues from time to time (primarily around 11 and again at 3 or so). The service was not always the greatest - you'd occasionally get stuck dealing with someone who could not be less interested in assisting you - but I would still recommend this place to friends.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Nh Costanza", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1216555-Reviews-Nh_Costanza-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle deu i mata</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">66-99</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1216555", "ImgURL": ""}}
