Even that experience was as I would expect a hotel to manage it -- when we arrived for check-in it was obvious there was some problem, but we were treated to complimentary breakfast, told to leave our things in the lobby, and assured that everything would be taken care of. When we came back in the evening, our luggage had already been moved and we were in for the best surprise of the trip! As others have mentioned One by the Five is a private apartment with an atmosphere fully devoted to love and romance. Possibly because we were staying in a 900+ Euro room that we'd only paid $150 Euros for, we didn't get the complimentary champagne and fruit, but it was nonetheless a treat. I can understand some of the complaints that the decor is just \"too much\"... I would definitely recommend One by the Five for a romantic getaway of 1 or 2 days, but it could be overkill for an extended period of time. However, our one night was so lovely and comfortable that we completely skipped the plans we'd made for the morning to stay in. The bed is without a doubt the most comfortable I've EVER slept (or done anything else) on. The only hitch was that once the hotel staff left after showing us how to use the ridiculously complicated TV-iPod-lighting room controls, we couldn't get any of it to work again, except the lighting after a whole lot of fiddling. But honestly, the point of One by the Five is NOT to watch satellite TV!", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels", "Title": "\u201cRomantic Getaway\u201d", "Author": "JenMcTBrussels", "ReviewID": "UR103756479", "Content": "We stayed in the One by the Five for two nights and had a lovely romantic break from the rest of life. The suite is part of a hotel however it is in a separate building and so you are completely left to your own devices - your only interruption will be your breakfast being delivered at a time of your convenience (TIP: Make sure you have already unwrapped the bath robes for when the door-bell rings as they will keep ringing and you will end up fighting with your bath-robe) :) One by the Five is designed to make you think about just the two of you and it really does achieve that well. From the champagne in the fridge, to your own private dance floor, to the cocktail receipes, to Edith Piaf and Barry White on the ipod (they have a really great selection of music tracks), to the bedroom and rain shower - it really is fabulous....and great fun. It is expensive at 940 Euros per night (includes breakfast, the champagne, the fresh fruit in the fridge, the spirits and bottles of water) but it was really worth it and if you want to treat your spouse/partner/partner to be to something special then this is something they won't forget. The staff were great, extremely welcoming and have great recommendations for local places in the Latin Quarter - they really help to make your visit perfect (thanks to all for such a great stay). .....and on final note, the bed is probably the most comfortable we have ever slept in...you never want to leave.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Asheville, NC", "Title": "\u201cOne by The Five is an amazing experience\u201d", "Author": "NCRen", "ReviewID": "UR84333095", "Content": "This suite is the thing of dreams.

Behind an unappealing facade, start an amazing journey. In a typical parisian district, we felt far from everything. The One is THE place for couples looking for an escape, far from the reality of life, looking for complete privacy and above all an amazing experience. I can't say everything about this place as it has to be a bit of surprise, but let say it is the ideal place for a wedding proposal, for a honeymoon or just for a dirty weekend far far from the screaming kids. The design is great, the fittings are luxurious, the bed is a dream, everything has been created to create a one off experience. It is like being in your bubble, the two of you. and if you need a break, Paris is on your doorstep and its restaurants, bars, nightlife etc... So all in all we had an amazing time and we can only recommend this place for couples like us just looking to get away from it all.

You want to touch everything and try everything out straight away. As soon as Carine left us to it, I jumped on the bed! The bedroom is magical. If you have this room, you don't want to explore the rest of Paris! A night under the stars in your own cloudy bedroom is heavenly. My partner surprised me by booking this suite and surprised me even further by proposing to me! An absolute must if you like the original, boutique, unique, sensual style in a hotel. I loved my experience and it will definitely be one I won't be forgetting.
