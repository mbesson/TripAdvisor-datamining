The other side of the coin is, The room they first gave us was less more value than a cheapest hostel you can ever imagine, but we complained on it then they gave us a top floor which was ok looking room, and those are the one you see on their hotel room images. other problem with the hotel was about the bed since it was kind of broken as you feel better sleep on the floor (since they dont have sofas in the rooms as you see on the picture) rather than the bed we found in the room. also there is no wifi internet reach in the top floor, so we were suppose to go down the bar/restaurant to get a wifi and this was such a disappointment i most felt. also the room TV have less than 4 boring germany channels only. another thing is the noice from the main road since their windows are not sound proof which forced us to wakeup early everyday as u can not sleep more than 6am and it was also supported with the sun light getting all in your room since the curtains were so thin. Therefore, i recommend this hotel to high school teenagers or something like that but not for couples or other backpackers since we found out that, in berlin there are alot other cheap hotels worthing the price.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGet what you pay for, and a little more\u201d", "Author": "tieler", "ReviewID": "UR118643846", "Content": "We booked this hotel for our stay while running the Berlin Marathon in 2011.

It is in a trendy neighborhood full of nightlife and convenient to the train station.

The only problem is that they're moving equipment pretty early each morning. The hotel is reasonably clean, not perfect, but you're not paying for a four star hotel either. I would skip the breakfast. It says they have wifi in all the all rooms, but we could only get anything useful in the lobby or bar.

The price at 78euros pn for a twin room incl breakfast was very good for money. The hotel is opposite the East Side gallery and only a 5min walk from the U bahn. We flew into Schonfield so the S9 train takes about 25mins to reach the hotel and is a great location to explore Berlin. Day tickets are EUR6.10 and much easier and cheaper than taxis. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and breakfast served until 11.30am which is great if you want a late night out. The hotel has a bar which is open 24hours so convienient for beer or food but at the same time it retains a quiet ambience. The room was basic but clean and and good value for money and no problems with shower/water. The area around the hotel feels safe and the river next to the old Berlin Wall is perfect for taking a relaxing stroll. The nearby Simon dach Strasse (10mins walk) is a lively street full of good bars & restaurants and well recommended. Ask for direction as it is not easy to find at first. The O2 World arena has recently opened near the hotel so excellent for those attending a concert there.

Neither problem was fixed when we returned after our evening out even though we were assured they would be!
