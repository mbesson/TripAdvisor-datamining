{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Pleasantly Surprised!!! We visited Punta Cana in April '08 for 5 days. A friend who had previously gone recommended Liriocala. When we arrived, we noticed that it was a newer property. The check-in process was quick and we were able to check-in early (12:30pm) without problem. The price for a Junior Suite was excellent. The rooms were nice; queen bed, full bath, great air conditioning, full kitchen, dining table and sofa.The staff was very friendly. The only knocks were that we had to request face towels each day and the 4 a.m. wake up call every morning by the local rooster, who was roaming near the hotel. Breakfast is available at the hotel. I would definitely return in August and will recommend this hotel to all.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR243018759", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "huskey1"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d676648-r17191301-Liriocala_Apart_Hotel-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "676648", "Price": "$77"}}
