Other than those minor happening we were very impressed until we left the hotel and when we got home realized we left our laundry bag hanging on the back of the bathroom door with soiled laundry inside. I right away called the hotel and left a message. They called back the next day and \"yes\" they found it and would return it via UPS. Over a week later we received a call from UPS saying someone turned in this package which was delivered to them. The wrong address had been put on the box. Upon opening it, we found all the soiled clothing but no laundry bag! Now this bag is special because my husband has had this since he was in the military over 40 years ago. Why would they dump out the clothing and not send the bag. I have called several times and either get an answering machine or a call back saying they would get back to me on that. Still no answer or bag. This may seem trivial to most but it is special to my husband.

We were there in mid-January when Branson was not busy and the hotel had plenty of rooms. So why we were put next door to a barking dog (I was unaware that the hotel was dog friendly) is beyond me. We called the front desk and they immediately tried to resolve the situation with the barking dog's parents, but if it continued to be a problem, then they would happily move us.

I'll start by saying that anytime you are going to visit an area that emphasizes the tourisrm industry, you're going to find yourself having to pay for amenities. The Hilton is no exception. Upon arriving, we found that valet parking is available, as is parking that is closer to the entrance. Valet parking was quoted at $12 per day and covered parking at $8 per day. The hotel does have free parking on the far side of the convention center. If you opt for the free parking, be prepared for a hike. I found that it took approximately ten minutes from the time I left the room to the time I made it to the car each trip that I made. Internet is charged at a rate of $10 per day. During check in, we were offered our choice of free internet or free covered parking in lieu of housekeeping services during our stay, so you have your choice of parking, internet (WIFI) or clean towels. The hotel is also \"pet friendly\" which is either a plus when you are traveling with Fido or a curse if you don't like dogs in your hotel. The hotel is located near the Branson Landing and the old downtown area and both are within easy walking distance. The hotel also has a fitness center, business center, swimming pools, two bars and a restaurant. Additionally, the convention center can hold any sized event. The staff at the hotel is first rate. Everyone that I encountered was friendly and courteous. The convention staff was first rate and the meals and snacks provided during the convention were superior. The room that I stayed in was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. I also had a choice of varying degrees of softness to firm pillows on the bed. The room was equipped with a small refrigerator. The bathroom was large and well lit. I was also pleased with the cleanliness of the room as well as the overall appearance of the hotel. The only real drawback to the hotel was that there is one bank of four elevators to get you to your room from the convention center and the lobby. With large numbers of convention goers, the elevators are really taxed and you can find yourself waiting for quite some time to be transported.It is unfortunate that there are not additional elevators located near the middle of the convention center, as that would have greatly improved the logistics of getting people moved from convention venue to their rooms.

I will say they really need to wash the windows, as in the mornings with the sun coming up, you could barely see out the window for the dirt. The one huge disappointment was their restaurant...it was supposed to be \"fine dining\" and the decor and ambiance definitely made you feel like you were in for a treat, but the food was mediocre at best and my husband (who is NOT picky), just could not eat his stuffed pork chop because he thought it might be bad/old...and I must say it had an odd flavor. Everything else was great - the staff was very polite and efficient as well as courteous and pleasant. I would give them a try again, but I suggest they look for a new chef/manager for their restaurant.

Staff are very friendly and they are very aware of guests needs and respond quickly and professionally. If you are upgrading to a suite do not get an end room as they do not have a balcony and stay on the street side (positive numbers) as the trains come through in the middle of the night and are very noisy Suites are a good option because they have a limited kitchen with dining area.

The Breakfast buffet is not very good the bagels were stale and the choices limited. If you decide to have breakfast make sure to order an omelet or other breakfast offerings from your waiter as it is part of the buffet.(my waiter failed to mention that) For meetings the hotel needs some improvements. The meeting rooms are quite far from the hotel elevators and for many meetings the professional displays are in public areas. This is difficult as all supplies etc must be removed daily as there is no security and these areas are open to the public. Most of the food and break services were also in the public areas and without staff to supervise the break areas people from different groups and the public would visit and use these services that other groups were paying for. The design of these areas were not conducive to business as the general public would enter the exhibits.

That's not always something you want to do, particularly if you are carrying stuff back and forth from your room to your car (or if you are sneaking out and back from the convention hoping no one will notice!). You have to pay for internet in the room -- not unusual for a convention hotel -- and it's a standard rate. But don't bother asking about wifi in the convention center -- it's operated by the City of Branson, NOT the Hilton, and the connection in the convention center is $40/day! Seriously! Thank God for aircards! it is close to the Branson Landing and it is across the street from Starbucks -- a lifesaver! Check out Plum Beads across the street!

Excercise facility is also good-sized with new equipment (TVs on machines, etc). I would have preferred a few more ameneties in the pool changing area - the changing area being very small also. Staffing - The staff was all very helpful but I was struck by how few staff members appeared to be on duty in the lobby. For being a \"full service\" hotel, it was low on staff members. Usually only one person working the desk and the one or two bell man who helped with luggage and valet often seemed to be hard to find. Once or twice there was a line waiting on valet car pickups. Having said this I would stress again that what staff they did have did a great job. It just felt like in the lobby that you were in a ghost town relative to staff. Restaurant - The Level 2 restaurant offered a great - but expensive - dinner. It is priced like a high-end steak house so be prepared. Breakfast was great - but I was annoyed that they charged full price ($15) for my young daughter. It is cheaper to order off the menu for breakfast and just as good. For both meals - the food was excellent, however.

We also requested that our sofa bed be made out for our guests while we were at dinner which did not get done. Really enjoyed the location. Right across the street from the Landing. Great indoor and outdoor pool and hot tub. Pool was huge. There was also a fire pit outside by the pool which was would be nice to use at night. We ate the breakfast buffet which was very good. Overall a really great stay. I have also stayed at the Promenade which is right on the Landing and I think I liked this hotel better. I felt like this hotel had better amenities and the Promenade is too spread out. I also got much better service at this hotel.

The only concern for us is that it was a bit pricey. This is probably due to the proximity of the Landing, but overall we didn't have a problem paying for a King room. The room size was ok for a non-suite. It was nice to have a comfortable sofa in the room when we did not want to sit on the bed. The only issue worth mentioning with the room was the shower pressure. The room was a shower-only feature, and I assumed the shower pressure would have been much stronger. After several attempts to adjust the showerhead, I realize that it was not going to be a good result. Overall, it was a good stay for an extended night in the Branson area.

I found a good deal on Hotels.com that allowed us to pay for two nights at the Hilton and receive a third night for free. I had seen the Hilton when I was in Branson the past two times, but hadn't ventured into the lobby. When I arrived late Friday evening, I was very impressed with the level of service and the hotel lobby. The entire hotel is decorated in a modern/rustic style that is perfectly fitting for both the 21st century and the Ozark Mountains. We checked in quickly and made it to our room. The room was decorated nicely and was very spacious. We booked a King bed and were given a corner room. The view was very nice and I must say that the Hilton is definitely the most modern hotel in Branson. The level of service was excellent. Front desk staff and valet attendants were both very helpful. Room service was great too! Breakfast was delivered on time and the staff took extra care when delivering the wine we requested one evening. Being located beside Branson Landing was definitely a plus. The hotel is located downtown, so it isn't on the strip where most tourist attractions are located. But the downtown location is convenient to access the time saver routes that can get you to the area of the strip you wish to visit quite quickly.

There is a nice water display set to music every hour!", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, Il", "Title": "\u201cThe Hilton is tops\u201d", "Author": "clover0310", "ReviewID": "UR17687242", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Hilton Branson Convention Center for 2 nights. I had asked for early check-in and arrived at the hotel at 2:45 PM. Not only was my room ready but I had a view of Branson Landing Mall and Lake Taneycomo. I used the valet parking and the attendent was great as was the bellman who took my luggage after a 9 hour drive. The lobby is beautiful and relaxing with a water feature, concierge desk and places to just sit and soak it all in. The elevators were quiet and seemed to be always available. My room was on the 5th floor and had 2 quenn beds. The beds had wonderful linens and a mattress which one did not need to get used to in order to get a good night's sleep. There was a chair and ottoman by the windows too. The room has a large flat screen TV with access to pay per view movies and Nintendo games for the kids. You can easily block any or all of these items using your remote control if you don't want anything ordered by accident. The bathroom is large with a granite countertop. I do agree with the other reviewer comments on the bathroom lighting. It is difficult to see when trying to do hair or makeup. The towels are large, soft and fluffy. Best towels I've ever used in a hotel. We did not eat at the Hilton preferring to walk to the Landing for more choices. In addition, I was never able to find the hotel's coffee area, Java Jive, open. The literature stated it opened at 6 AM and stated no closing time, yet everytime I walked through the lobby area, it was closed. The pools and fitness center were amazing. An indoor pool and spa as well as an outdoor pool and spa. It was great. The fitness center has Precor machines so you have no excuse to not keep up on your workout. I booked my room using the Hilton site and got a AAA rate. I've stayed in Branson several times now and this is hands down, my favorite hotel. For a short trip, it was very relaxing and peaceful and I would stay there again as long as I could get a great rate. Here's hoping the Hilton continues to give travelers a great retreat!", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "WellTraveledLady", "ReviewID": "UR17085061", "Content": "This hotel is beautiful.

This is an experience you Must make a priority. The train station is directly below the rooms. Shopping is right out the door. We have been staying in Branson three times a year for the past 30 years. There are many attractions in the area, this is one in itself. We had two rooms reserved. We asked for one to be upgraded for our children's anniverssary and were given a suite that was like a luxury condo. Two flat screen tvs. That helped when the men wanted to watch the basketball playoffs and the kids wanted to watch a movie. Nice pools. You feel so special. HINT: get take out and stay in the room. You want to spend every moment in the room. Parking is right outside. Please, treat yourself. It is worth every penny. The staff was the greatest! No place compares with the beds.

From its first impression as the valet attendant whisks my vehicle away and another leads me into the stunning lobby, I was distracted by so many wonders! Finally, an elegant yet comfortable hotel in Branson where nature meets urban. A perfect balance for the area. A much needed facility, with its large convention center, this place is bound to become a haven for many business travellers and companies that need to book large meetings. The rooms were high-tech, comtemporary meets rugged as each Hilton is designed specifically for its location. Branson is a step back in time as people come from all over to meet the past and see shows, crafts, and experience life of yesteryear. However, although history draws visitors here, visitors still need to have the modern offerings of the high tech world that we live in. It's not only an excellent place for business guests but those who are there for pure FUN! With in-room on demand movies, room service, state-of-the-art fitness center, indoor and heated outdoor pools and hot tubs, and amazing dining, those who come to have a great time will find it at the Hilton.
