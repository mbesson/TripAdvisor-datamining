The hotel is modern, clean and fairly tastefully furnished. Although we rented a car, we chose to drive the car until just outside the city center where parking is easier and free and then catch a bus into Centro. The only downside to this hotel is the fact that it is located outside Rome in the outskirts. There is a Carrefour Hypermarket nearby but apart from that it is a pretty remote place. However, a half hour bus ride into Centro is worth it when you compare apple for apple with the postage stamp sized rooms that you'd get for the same price from hotels in the center of Rome!. The rooms are fine and we found the toilets fairly well appointed with good toiletries supplied. The king sized bed was comfortable. Internet was available downstairs and although fairly well patronized, we did not have to wait for an inordinate amount of time before we could use them.

It is billed as a conference center, and it is probably well suited for that because it has several large dining areas and seems built to handle large groups, although it wasn't staffed for large groups when I was there. The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable if you like hard mattresses. Our group spent 4 nights there at the start of our tour and the last night before we left, and the only real complaint from anyone was the remote location. The meals in the evening were good, but not outstanding. Our breakfast was a buffet in a different serving area and had a large variety from cereal, pastry and fresh fruit to eggs and sausage and bacon. They had 2 modern coffee machines and 2 juice machines where you press buttons for your choice of beverage but every morning one or the other wasn't working, so you couldn't depend on getting that red orange juice or a hot chocolate. For those who must be \"connected\", there was WiFi and 2 computers by the elevator that were free for the using on a first come, first served basis. I had no problem checking the weather and news every day, but others in the group reported outages in both wired and wireless access. Our group boarded a bus every morning and went touring in Rome, so we spent too much time in the horrible traffic, especially on the October morning the flash flood hit Rome and turned our 30 minute ride into a two hour trip. If your primary purpose is touring Rome, choose another hotel! You'll pay more, but it is worth it in the long run. If you want a kickoff point to go North, East or South, this is your place.

We booked this hotel for just 40euros a night so we weren\u2019t too fussed. It was well air-conditioned, which is a bonus when combating the Roman heat. It took one metro line and a bus to get there from Roma Termini, both only costing 1euro each, which was very good. You have to be sure to get on the right bus though, as we did initially head off in the wrong direction. The hotel offers a free shuttle service, but it only leaves from the nearest metro station at 10pm heading back to the hotel, and at 10am & 12pm heading out to the metro station. So it\u2019s good if you\u2019re arriving late or have spent the day in the city, but you do need to book it. Our room was good; we had a mini-bar, which we simply used to cool our own cheaper supermarket drinks. There is a casino-come-caf\u00e9 about 500m down the road (not a pedestrian-friendly walk however!) There\u2019s also a great little local restaurant further down over a bridge, more like 1km away. It was worth it though, as they did a pretty good spaghetti, and for a fraction of the cost of the hotel\u2019s overpriced restaurant. We would recommend this hotel to those on conference or those wanting a 40euro a night hotel in Rome and don\u2019t mind the travel. It is very far out, but it\u2019s cheap transport in Rome, and if you do your homework it\u2019s not that bad. 40euros a night is hard to beat and you have to take the good with the bad.

Rooms are very clean, comfortable, quiet and dark at night, a good night's sleep is on the cards after lots of sight seeing. We found the staff really friendly and helpful. There is a bar and restaurant although we didn't see much activity at breakfast time and went into Rome to eat. The down side is that it's a long way out. Using a taxi would defeat the object of saving money on the hotel and so the only realistic option is public transport. It's cheap and easy when you know how and here's how. Buy a metro / bus ticket for 3 days or a week depending on length of stay, it's cheap and makes life a lot easier as you only validate on first use. Get on the metro B line, direction Rebibbia, and get off at Ponte Mammolo. Go out the metro station and you will see the bus terminal, you need the 508. They should run every 20 minutes but there doesn't appear to be a time table. Get onto the right hand side of the bus and near an exit if it's crowded. It's 20 - 25 minutes and so you have room to manoeuvre if it's busy. Watch out for a 'Penny Market', then the turning (not advertising sign) to 'Decathalon' and then Hotel Bright, at this point ring the bell and get off at the next stop. Walk on for 5 minutes in the direction of the bus (there's no footpath) and you'll come to the hotel's drive on the right. If you miss the stop you can get off at the next one and walk back but it's further. To get into Rome reverse the journey. Out of the hotel's drive, walk left along the road, cross to bus stop. Take 508 to the Ponte Mammolo terminal. Switch to the metro B line. For Colosseum stay on the B line to Colosseo. For Vatican Museums, Spanish Steps, etc you'll need to switch to A line at Termini.

The hotel is in the middle of nowhere but you can get the shuttle to a local underground, where you have to find your own way into the city. The shuttle only leaves three times a day, 10:00, 12:00 and 22:00. But we were happy to stay out all day from 12-10pm to see all the sights. When asking the staff how to get into the city they were very unhelpful. There was always a queue at the reception and they were in no hurry to serve you. They answered the telephone when you were in the middle of talking to them. They also did not care if you were waiting in a queue and other people pushed to the front, they would just serve them first. It was cheap enough to stay there, although by the time you add on the price of taxis's, the shutle bus and underground passses etc then is it really!? You have to be confident to get around on your own, following the complex underground system etc. The room had no complimentary tea/coffee which you find in simple travel inns etc. The t.v. had no english channels, they were all Italian. But, again it depends if you are wanting to watch the t.v. The hotel did take advantage of the fact it is in the middle of nowhere. You have to pay for tea/coffee, drinks etc, no local shops. The hotel restaurant was lovely but quite expensive (4 euro for a coca cola). Ending on a positive, the rooms were very spacious and clean. The daily upkeep of the room was excellent.

Seeing as this was the case and we were still paying a fair bit for it we went ahead and set off the next day. On arriving at flumicino airport we asked tourist information on how to go about getting a taxi as it was late. We were told a taxi would be in excess of 75euros!! so we took the train instead to Tiburtini which took 45 mins, then the metro to ponte mammalo anf then a bus to via prenestina where the hotel is located. All in all it took about an hour and a half to reach a road scattered with milatary bases and car dealerships in the middle of which seemed like nowhere. The staff were surly and rather unhelpful and just handed us our keycard to our room. The room its self was spacious, though ive seen nicer premier/travel inns to be fair and the bathroom, though clean and modern only had a shower, which disapointed as all i wanted was a nice hot soak after the journey. We were told the hotel had cable and pay TV ...there were no english channels at all ( no BBC prime or anything ) which i wouldnt have minded as i dont go away to watch TV in hotels, but as we were restricted on being back by about 10 at night as the only transport would have been a hefty taxi cost, it would have been nice. Turned out there was no 'pay TV' either and then we later found out the internet in the room didnt work. After complaining about the internet twice and a technician coming up to fix it with no success, we were simply refunded and told that was that ( deal with it basically ) The staff couldnt have given a monkeys and seemed quite put out when we asked anything of them. After seeing the cost of the restaurant in the hotel we asked where the nearest bar/pizzeria was. We ended walking 15mins up some busy road with no pavements and constant traffic, with what looked like prostitutes hanging about to get to. There was a major supermarket 'carrefour' 15 mins in the other direction which we ended up buying food and wine from and simply emptied the mini bar to keep our goods chilled as the food at the hotel is overpriced and when ordering room service it turns up cold. Getting to Rome every day was a chore taking just over an hour though the transport in Rome is fantastically cheap. Im glad i went to Rome as the city is stunning but i was so saddened that this part of my romantic getaway was spoilt.

We wanted a double bed but were greeted with two hard single beds pushed together which wasn\u2019t so comfy at night due to the split down the middle.

Returning to the Termini we collected our luggage and took the Metro to Tiburtina station, from where we took a cab to the hotel, costing us around 22Euros. The check- in process was swift and smooth. We found the hotel room to be spacious and clean but what worried us was the mode of transport to the city centre as cabs were expensive. We booked the hotel return shuttle from the Termini which was 4 Euros per head. On an experiment basis we took a cab outside the hotel to Ponte Mammolo, from where we took the metro to Termini. It felt good being back in the historic city and we continued to explore the city as the Hop on and off tickets were valid for 24 hours. We were back in time to catch the return shuttle to the hotel, the journey took us 20 minutes.

The shuttle bus to Rome worked out very well for us as we drove to Rome and knew better than to try to drive into the town center (we did this on our first trip to rome and paid 60Euro a night to park our car!!!) The only trouble with the bus was that you had to make arrangements for it in the morning and couldn't change your plans. A better option would probably be to use the public transport just outside the hotel property but our friends from Texas would have none of that after seeing the women walking the streets. This hotel is really too far from Rome to be considered for a Roman holiday. For the same price you can get a decent two star hotel in the town center with breakfast. The trip into town takes about 45 minutes and it is impossible to simply leave the hotel at night and wander the streets of the eternal city safely which is one of the things that makes Rome great. If you are driving to Rome, however, the Hotels free parking may make up for the long trip to town.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Comfortable Hotel, a little far out, but value for money\u201d", "Author": "saltbran", "ReviewID": "UR16353231", "Content": "A hotel by the termini was very expensive, so i decided to stay here, compared represent excellent value for money.

We had to pay 40 euros for the taxi only to reach the hotel from Roma Ciampino airport otherwise we could not go to the hotel. I asked them about the transportation to the hotel from the airport but there was no reply at all from them so we had to take taxi. After we arrived, there was no problem with the check-in but there was one with my room door. The electronic key could not open it. I went to the receptionist to complain it and he gave me another one. Still, it didn't work. Finally, he gave me the regular key and promised to fix the problem in the next day but it didn't happen. In the second day, we had a problem with the shuttle bus service. We already had booked for such service one night before and the receptionist told me to come to the receptionist again tomorrow before departure for the bus ticket. We booked for the 12.00 bus and he told me to come downstairs at 11.45. What happened was astonishing. I looked a very long queue of people for checking-out and were serviced only by one hotel staff. I had to stand in the line as well just for the ticket. I started to queue at 11.40 and until 12.10 I still could not able to have the tickets. I lost my patience and went forward to the staff to ask about my problem. He said calmly, \"Oh, the bus already left Sir.\" Then I got furious and he replied \"Sorry Sir, you have to wait in the line\". I could not stand it anymore. Then we managed to find our own way to the center of Rome by public transport which cost us cheaper than we took the shuttle but takes longer time, about 1 our to the center. Then, when we checked-out, the hotel billed me for the booked shuttle service. I complained and the staff told me that I cant complain because I already booked it. I got furious again and finally talked to the manager and she managed it and said sorry to us. Overall, this is a brand new hotel with brand new management as well. All rooms are well-furnished. Very modern style with good private bathrooms and toilets. It could be better if they can provide water cooker in the rooms. However, for for us, the value for money of this hotel is not OK at all. Although it's cheap, it's too far from the city center and if you want to take the shuttle, you have to pay 4 euro each person for one way only. Return = 8 euro each.

The room was small, the bed extremely hard and uncomfortable, and there was minimal lighting. The biggest problem was the heating. There was no way to shut it off since it is centrally controlled. We had the window open 100% of the time (and so did everyone else). The shower in the bathroom was so small that I had to squeeze myself in and out of it with some discomfort. The conference food was terrible. My husband and I didn't eat it several times. Lunches and dinners were served in three courses: pasta, meat and dessert. No salads and a vegetable only once. Potatoes twice. Rolls were on the table as were still and effervescent mineral water. The waiters and waitresses came to the tables with platters and served us from those platters which took a long time for our group of about 110. The pasta was certainly not up to Italian standards and often cold. The meat was skimpy, and one day the pork they served was not fully cooked: it was a dark pink. The breakfast buffet was not up to par either. It did included scrambled eggs, however, they were powdered and not fresh eggs. The breads served were somewhat stale. On the plus side, for celiacs (those with gluten allergies), they did offer several gluten-free packaged pastries. I'm not a celiac, but I have a daughter who is (but she wasn't with us). This hotel is quite a distance from the center of Rome, so I would not recommend it for sightseers. The hotel does have a free shuttle into the city, but we didn't use it. There was only one computer in the lobby for hotel guests to use so there was sometimes a line. We stayed at the hotel one night beyond the conference and ate in its restaurant. The Caesar salad was made up primarily of sliced chicken breast and parmigiana cheese. What little lettuce there was came from the very inside of the lettuce and was bitter.

Me and my Sister decided on the Thursday that we would get a last minute flight on the Sunday morning and spend 6 nights with them. As we had decided to go last minute we didnt have a huge budget just enough for the flight, hotel, food and to see all the attractions. We searched for a hotel in our budget but as we were last minute most central hotels were fully booked and because of this we had to look futher out of the city centre. This led us to Eurostars Roma Congress . When my sister told me the distance from the hotel to central Rome I was a bit shocked as we had worked out it was about 8 miles and thought it may spoil our trip, but we were lucky that all of us had chipped in to get a rented car for the 6 days and so driving to and from the hotel to central Rome was not a problem (although we got lost almost every night going to the hotel), though if you were planning to stay in this hotel and see all Rome attractions without a hire car I would not advise it, cos it would mean paying 35 euros for a taxi (one way) or getting on the shuttle bus everyday but there are only 2 in the morning into Rome and one at about 8 at night back to the hotel (which makes your days very limited). Apart from the distance and travelling into Rome centre, the hotel is fab!!!! It was so modern and clean. The reception area was huge and tidy and as it wasnt in the centre it wasnt to busy with tourist and was mostly used for business people who were there for conferences. The room was big and beds comfy and the bathroom was immaculate and roomy. All the towels were changed everyday and when we came in each night the room was tidy and not once were we bothered and everything from check in/ out to paying went smoothly. The only thing was that we didnt have bed and breakfast and a couple of days we had breakfast but it was dear at about 17 euros. I used the free internet access every night (in the lobby area) which was great to keep in touch with my partner, which was an excellent facility provided by the hotel (internet access in available in the room but at a charge). I would highly recommend this hotel for comfort and price but if you want to go to Rome to see the sights and fill your days with sightseeing then I would suggest getting a hotel closer to the centre.

We headed off and in about 10mins were outside the hotel, all smiles until I asked how much the cab fare was, to be told \"sorry meter is broken, but price will be sixty euros\" To which I said \"You are having a laugh\" or something to that affect as I am certainly no fool and can blag best price as good as the next man.

We freshened up and headed off into town, reception advised us to get the bus at the bottom of the road as by 1100hrs we had missed the shuttle bus. We headed off down the road to the bus stop which is a good 5-10mins walk. Buses run quite regular but the journey takes at least 20mins to bus station where you then have to get a tube which takes a further 15mins to the terminal....... from where you take an additional journey to whichever attraction you are going to see. Totalling that up the trip could be a minimum of fourty five minutes. Not to forget that even in May weather in Rome is warm and public transport is overcrowded to say the least.

You would be much better off picking up something to eat here! Try the blood oranges...and the hard rolls were great! It is true that the showers cycle hot and cold water, you would think a newer hotel would not have that problem!", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cFantastic & Cheap 4 Star Hotel If You Plan For Location Issue...\u201d", "Author": "StevenParky", "ReviewID": "UR7391034", "Content": "In Summary... Hotel Quality **** Location * Value For Money ***** We arrived at Ciampino after some really cheap flights from Nottingham East Midlands. I went over to a taxi driver who said it would be \u20ac55 for the journey! OUCH - there goes the cheap flights? It was actually a lot better for us to take a \"terravision\" bus from the airport (for ryanair and easyjet passengers only - \u20ac8 each) to the Termini (train station) in central Rome. At the station we left our luggage for 6 hours (costing \u20ac3.60 per item). During this time we were able to make the most of the time we had and started exploring! I used my mobile to call the friendly reception desk who said that the hotel shuttle bus left from VIA MASALA in between building numbers 7 and 9 (this is a small bus park on the edge of the street for about 8 buses). We thought this would be free as it did state in our details it was, however it was \u20ac4 per person per way. Note: the bus leaves the hotel at 0830 and 1100 and returns from VIA MASALA at 1800 and 2230. This proved a much cheaper way of getting to the hotel rather than taxi. However - the hotel have a black mercedes service for the way back costing \u20ac50 (we had no option than to get this because of our flight time)! People have had some bad experiences with this hotel and I kind of thought twive about booking it. I took the gamble and it was excellent, upgraded to superior at no extra charge! If you plan ahead - you will win. Those who mentioned the poor, slow reception service - isn't that just the Italian way?

Check in staff efficient and we got our room straight away even though its was only 11 30 am . The room was spacious with king size bed good size tv but as usual the only english channels were CNN and BBC world news ..Room was spotless but the shower had a lot to be desired , it looked great but varied between freezing cold and scalding hot (not the best ) . I had read reviews about money being taken from the room so didn't risk the safe . On our day of arrival had missed the shuttle bus so made our way into Rome via bus and metro which is easily doable . The hotel is situated in a quiet area but there is a small shopping mall not 5 minutes walk from the hotel with a large Carrefours supermarket there . Didn't have breakfast but tried the bar food one night which I have to say was pretty bad. We personally would not stay at this hotel again becuse of the location , it's too far from Rome ,1 night it took an hour to return to the hotel", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cDont stay here\u201d", "Author": "joebatafuco", "ReviewID": "UR7155397", "Content": "This hotel was horrendus.

It is a little way out, but it is not in the middle of nowhere, it is on one of the main roads out of rome. We paid between 15 euros and 30 euros in metered taxis., depending on traffic from hotel to Termini station. Takes between 15 and 45mins, depending on traffic, but all of rome is like that. From termini station there are unlicensed taxis who you can haggle with. We paid no more than 20 euros late at night to get back to hotel. On saturday we used public transport from hotel,;bus then metro, whole journey cost only 1 euro each, and was a good way to meet some colourful locals. Wouldn't recommned this late at night. Hotel shuttle bus was also useful 4 euros each way to Termini, although i think they could run more services, particularly later at night, with a smaller minibus.

What we didn't like was having to stand in a queue outside the breakfast room until a table became available, but the breakfast and the staff more than made up for this.
