The room was small but well equipped, & everything in the room worked ok. I had an excellent view of the fire escape, the area outside of the window was narrow, tall & shadey so the air outside was never too hot to have the window open. The airconditioning outlet looked quite small, but as the room is also small it functioned well enough for me to have to increase the temperature during the first night. (Digital thermostat with one-degree increments.) Hot water was reliable and at a good pressure. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, the sink had a small selection of the usual goodies (soap, shower gel, shampoo). Hairdrier worked ok, I don't need one but I had to test it... Shaver socket in the bathroom, 220Vac. I counted a total of four power points in the room, three above the desk & another hidden beneath it. Storage in the room was adequate, with a wardrobe containing a roomsafe & several drawers, and a small desk unit. The bed was clean & comfortable. No noise from the street (being away from the road), or from the neighbours, although I stayed Monday to Friday so I missed the weekend. Large flatscreen TV with remote control, easily found a music channel (Kiss- channel 31). Room entry uses a swipe card, once the card is swiped against the sensor the door just pushes open. The lights don't work until the card is fed into the slot on the wall just inside the door. The door has a robust looking double lock. Lighting in the room was good. Breakfast room in the basement ok, self-service continental. 7.30 - 10 am. Croissants, toast, rolls, ham, salami, cheese (sliced but stuck together in one lump!), coffee, hot & cold milk, cereals, fruit juice, butter, honey & jam. No eggs though. No bar or restaurant, but there are plenty around nearby. The bars in Calle San Bernardo close about 11pm, but the ones along the Gran Via stay open later.

I had a really nice, clean and spacious room overlooking the main street (I asked for that). It was well-equipped and had a strong and hot shower and maid service was fine. I had spoken to Almudena at reception prior to booking and arrival. She is fluent in English as also is Ivan at reception. But having named those two, I must stress that ALL the reception staff were cheerful, helpful and highly professional \u2013 helping with information and even confirming a restaurant booking for me with no hesitation. It is the sort of service one would normally expect from a much higher priced hotel. Unfortunately I don\u2019t know all their names or I would mention them all. The Alexandra is in the last stages of renovation but this didn\u2019t disturb me in any way. Not noisy or intrusive. Some of the corridor carpets are a trifle dusty - but why would anyone need to stand in a corridor for more than 30 seconds while going from the elevator to their bedrooms? The hotel location is about 2 minutes off the Gran Via - so totally central and even arrival by metro from Barajas, with a couple of line changes, was not that difficult (as I only had hand luggage anyway). The hotel is within a 5-minute walk to Callao and Sol\u2026 and in fact is really so central that it\u2019s within walking distance to nearly everywhere. Breakfast was adequate and there was plenty of it. The dining room was pretty busy and staff quickly replaced food items on empty dishes. On my next visit to Madrid (which I hope won\u2019t be too long away), I will most definitely stay at Hotel Alexandra. The staff are all so willing and happy and the hotel is such good value for money - which is often difficult to find in a beautiful and vibrant capital city.

I used the free wi-fi in the McDonalds on the charming plaza of the Opera metro, due south of the hotel. Nearby, go see the incredibly impressive Palacio Real south of the Plaza de Espana: phenomenal in size, elegance and grandeur. In the evening, mime artists (like the silver-coated skier who makes a funny noise every time he moves, plus the seated man with no head but who's wearing a hat and sunglasses, whose white-gloved hand waves at incredulous watching children, out with their parents), street performers and a Mariachi band enliven and captivate throngs of people up the hill at Plaza Callao. There are many traditional Spanish bars and restaurants in the side-streets, displaying appetizing photos of paella; sea food; ham; and pasta dishes. For morning coffee outside, consider the expansive, sheltered, quiet square at Plaza Ramales, where there are many comfortable cushioned metal chairs in the open air outside cafes - ideal on a sunny autumn morning. While crossing the white-striped road at pedestrian traffic lights, listen out for the song bird sound indicating when you can cross, which becomes more insistent as the lights are about to change against you. For a most pleasant 2-day stay in the heart of Madrid, with everything close by, within easy walking distance, consider Hotel Alexandra, in the UK\u00b4s Thomas Cook City Breaks package, flying from Gatwick London.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cvery comfortable and friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "sloppyjoeBelfast", "ReviewID": "UR48450132", "Content": "if and when we go back to madrid we,ll be sure to stay here.the alexandra hotel its a very friendly and comfortable place to stay .its location is ideal 2euros from airport by metro 2 stops . 1 euro by bus outside hotel to real madrid stadium.seconds away to gran via. various metro stations whithin walking distance hotel staff were excellent .very informative and friendly.highly recommended for city break value for money", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood location but very, very noisy\u201d", "Author": "paperalice", "ReviewID": "UR43050266", "Content": "The location of this hotel, for the price, can't be beaten.

We had to ask to change rooms as they put us next to the room being worked on. They workmen arrived, very loudly, at half 8 in the morning and didn't stop until 7 at night. We couldn't have a relaxing lie in or an afternoon nap, which is often taken in Spain. The walls are also very thin and you can hear everything from next door.

The reception staff didnt speak great English (though I found this in most of Madrid) but you got by. The hotel is a little grubby and in need of a facelift. The lifts look like they could break down at any time. The breakfasts are poor. You get a choice of 2 cereals, a small bread roll with the usual cheese, ham and salami you normally get at European hotels. I would suggest not bothering booking B&B, nobody checks anyway so you might even be able to blag something. There is a 24hr shop next door to the hotel that provides most stuff to get you by anyway. As for the noise. We stayed on the 4th floor at the back of the hotel and didnt hear any traffic noise although the rooms ARE thin walled and you hear a lot of door slamming, toilet/bathroom activities and conversations. The beds were made each day though the sheets werent changed! There are plus points though. As everyone says the location really is good, the nearest metro is a couple of minutes away, as is the main shopping areas. If you are on a budget then this hotel is probably only on par with some of the better hostels, so you may want to look around.

The location is brilliant as it is located just off of Gran Via, right near all the threatres. The entrance to the hotel was clean & average for a european hotel. We had booked a double room but on arrival were given a twin room & were told that even though there were rooms available! The staff in general were fine but two of the men working on reception were very rude & not one bit helpful. They also refused to speak english, even though they knew exactly what we were saying. The room itself was clean - the beds were changed everyday & the bathroom was small but fine. It's very true about the carpets, they are TERRIBLE & dirty looking. We had breakfast in the hotel on the first morning but I would suggest giving this a miss as the cereal was gone off & there was very little choice. All in all the hotel is fine if ilke me you want a clean, not too expensive hotel to basically put your head down in at night as you will be out all day. One thing that this place really has going for it is it's location, it is so close to everything that you would easily put up with the rudeness & not so great furnishings.

Even though a notice at reception said that breakfast would cost extra, I wasn't actually charged for it. The room was comfortable enought , though rather functional and characterless,and the bathroom (with bath and matching plug!) was spacious and well-appointed.
