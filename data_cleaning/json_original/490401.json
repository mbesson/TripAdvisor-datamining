The Hotel is located far enough from the crowds of the Boardwalk but close enough to some of Ocean City's highlights. As a part of the Fagers Island complex, there is a foot bridge that goes directly to the restaurant. The hotel is a boutique style hotel that has a very private feel. The rooms have floor to ceiling windows with panoramic views of the Bay and the 60th Street Bridge. Most rooms have an in-suite jacuzzi and the bathrooms are large with walk-in showers. The staff is very friendly, however, guests should know that this is not a 24 hour full-service resort. The front desk and room service are available until 11PM each evening. The only reason that The Edge received 4/5 stars is because some of the room features were a little dated (carpet, window treatments, etc.) and since the suites have floor to ceiling windows, not all of the windows have blinds/curtains. This means that the rooms are VERY bright at about 6AM. Otherwise, if the Edge would make some renovations and updates to room fixtures (especially the blinds) I would give it 5 Stars.

Many thanks to her! I had never been to OC before but had heard that the beaches were beautiful. Returning from a roadtrip to visit family in North Carolina, we stopped at a few well known locations along the eastern seaboard. Two nights spent at the Edge along with the spectacular beaches just across the main road have made OC a spot we will return to again in the near future. The Edge is not your typical Ocean City lodging. It is away from the hustle and bustle of the Boardwalk and strip and it is not ocean front. It does however sit on the Bay of Wight and offers spectacular sunset views if you are lucky enough to be here on a clear day. We were booked in the Left Bank Suite, Suite #1. It wasn't my first choice but my husband wanted a balcony and loved the two stories of windows on the 2 walls facing water. The balcony is on the small side with enough room for 2 chairs and a small table and sits just above and to the right of the pool. It is a first floor accomodation. It has a queen bed which offers beautiful water views and a double jacuzzi tucked against the 2 story wall ofwindows. A warning to anyone who may have read in prior posts that one cannot see into the windows. This is untrue. A couple exploring the pool deck walked along a small deck slightly below our windows and seemed to look in ( i would have too)...since the shower area is wide open if you don;t pull the curtains, i asked my husband to go outside and see what he could see....which was everything up to the glass wall of the shower. A warning if you plan to be in the jacuzzi without the shades drawn...which i guess is the point of a jacuzzi in this location offering great water views. In spite of that issue, this is a great room , very spacious and very bright and open. There is a chaise tucked near the balcony slider which offers a great spot to read if the weather outside isn't the best. The sofa is a little stiff but we weren't there to watch TV! At turndown, the girl(s) will light the array of candles scattered through the room and draw the shades but we opted to enjoy the views when we woke and asked that the shades be left open. They deliver breakfast bread, OJ and fruit the night before which personally i would consider a \"snack\" not a continental breakfast. All were great and appreciated. There is a coffeemaker in the room with Starbucks, teas and hot chocolate as well as a small fridge. The pool area is just above the marsh area and is fairly small. I am not sure if there is another at the Lighthouse. It was overcast and a bit windy and we chose to stay on our deck rather than the pool deck since our view was the same we were so close! Right at the end of the pool area, within 20 ft of our balcony, was an ospray roost which provided alot of natural entertainment as a pair of osprays spent a good portion of each AM and evening. We walked to the beach just across the main road and had it all to ourselves for a few hours as the weather alternated between fog rolling in and the sun struggling to peak through. I am sure in the high season, it is crowded given all the condo units but we enjoyed our quiet pre-season day on this beautiful expanse of the eastern seaboard, We ate dinner at Fagers the first night and returned to eat in the less formal bar area the second night. Sunday night was quiet but Monday there was a DJ and the bar area was very crowded and lively. There are firepits and tables which was lovely and appreciated during our stay which was a little cool and overcast! I am sure after driving around contemplating other dining spots that this is one of the best Ocean CIty has to offer.

We stayed in Room 1, \"The Left Bank\" which has a 20' ceiling and windows that dominate the wall facing the bay. The room had all the amenities and was so relaxing. A continental breakfast is delivered every evening for the following morning, which we ate on the balcony overlooking the bay, listening to the sound of the seagulls flying over the water and watching the gentle ripples of the currents. We loved the swimming pool -- so different from the usual run of the mill hotel pools. With this pool, you walk into it like you would at the beach or lake; the steps are further in. It's very cosy with lounge chairs arranged around the pool. The people we met at the pool were very friendly, and, while the pool is not large, it was never crowded. While there were some housekeeping issues with our room, they were minor and remedied immediately. The staff were very friendly and responsive. We ate several times at the property's restaurant, The Restaurant at Fager's Island, and were never disappointed. I can highly recommend the mojito's -- (especially the mango mojito) -- the best ever! The lobster tails were also especially sweet and deliciious. The strawberry shortcake is to die for! We hope to make this an end-of-summer tradition and come back each year and stay in the same room. There are only 12 rooms in The Edge and each one is decorated in a different style. We did see some other rooms, but we decided we liked The Left Bank best and hope to stay in this room again.

We, and our luggage, were then loaded onto a golf cart by a gentleman who drove us over a small bridge to our room. We stayed in suite #9, each room is different. He gave the run down of the room. We asked him how far the beach was and he offered to drive us to the bus stop when we were ready. when we called he was at our room right away, it then started to rain lightly and we decided to drive. There is maid service twice a day. The room was immaculate. I once accidently left some money laying around along with my camera and I am pleased to say it was right where I left it when I returned. The room was kept stocked with free soda, godiava coffee, hot cocoa and tea. There were lovely glass mugs for drinking. The only charge for the refreshments was for the Fuji water which we decided not to drink. The \"continental\" breakfast is two small plates of breakfast bread, fresh grapes and orange juice. Not much, but still nice. It was enough to tide us over until we got out in the morning. The bed was incredibly comfortable. At night, there was the turndown service. Candles lit around the room, chocolates on the pillows and the electric fireplace lit. The heartshaped jacuzzi is right by the window. No worries, there is nothing but gorgeous water (not the beach) so no one can see in. There were comfy robes and thick , plush towels, extra large ones at the jacuzzi. This is a room for couples, the standing shower is open with no curtain. (No room for modesty) I was a little sensitive to the soap and had a very unpleasant reaction. Not a big deal, I ran out to CVS and bought what I normally use. The crab cakes at the restaurant were so good, when we checked out we got some for the road.

We previously stayed at the Lighthouse so we were familiar with Fager's Island. I found the Edge to be much nicer than the Lighthouse, although it is quite expensive at $400 a night (make sure to ask for the AAA discount, that saved us 10% a night). The suite was nicely decorated and very comfortable. The hot tub overlooking the bay was very relaxing and the king size bed was comfortable with a nice pillow top mattress pad. The views are incredible and it was a real pleasure to sit out on the balcony during the evening sunsets. The room has an \"electric\" fireplace, which is just a fake fireplace that lights up -- it's cheesy and not at all like a real fireplace. As other reviews have noted, the continental breakfast is a bit skimpy, if the pound cake were just double the size, then it would be fine. The nightclub at Fager's Island goes until about 2 a.m. and we could hear the music in our room so we had to put the air conditioning fan on to drown out the sound -- next time we'll bring a white noise machine. The only other downside is that the housekeeping staff is very, very slow -- they were all quite friendly and did a great job, but were slow; they took about an hour to clean our room each morning and the evening turndown service took about 15 minutes; so several times we ended up waiting out on the balcony for them to finish, it was definitely the slowest housekeeping crew I've encountered of all the hotels I've stayed at. I wish they'd add online booking as an option on their website.

The decor is contemporary and cosy and includes an open wet-room/shower and electric, real-flame fireplace. Just to add to the romantic atmosphere, the turn-down service means that you return to your room to find the place lit with candles and Godiva chocolates left on your pillow. The staff (Andrea in particular) were invaluable in pointing out a number of restaurants in Ocean City, based on the type of food/environment we were looking for and booked taxis for us where necessary.

The bathroom was very modern, with glass-block walls and an open granite and glass-block shower. There is also a huge whirlpool situated in front of the windows (with blinds of course!) were you can soak away and enjoy the sunset.
