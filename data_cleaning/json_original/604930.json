Spent the night there while in B'more overnight about a week ago. First, let me say the rooms STINK and smell of cigarettes (we had a non-smoking room); the minute you walk in the smell of smoke hits you smack in the face. Second, the walls are extremely thin, you could hear couples not only on both sides of you having sex but the couple above us I thought was going to come through the roof you could hear them, I truly expected the bed to crash through the roof at any minute (also, while sounds of sex could be clearly heard, there were family's there with children in some rooms) I truly hope that couples were not in the rooms with children doing their \"thing.\" The KILLER of it all was when I awoke the next morning, I had a strange bite mark below my lip on my chin which I later found out was a BED BUG BITE! My wife freaked out because she's a nurse and she said she thought it was either a mosquito or spider bite based on the circular pattern of the bite mark, I saw my doctor who confirmed what it actually was. Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to the place of business ever again.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honey Grove, Pennsylvania, United States", "Title": "\u201cIt's not that bad...\u201d", "Author": "Ian C", "ReviewID": "UR126417019", "Content": "The lady at the front desk was very polite despite her not understanding English very well. The price was $20 cheaper than the Econo Lodge at the other side of the parking lot and had the same rooms. There were not many people there. The room smelled strongly of some sort of cleaning product, just cant think of what it is. The floor, furniture, and beds were clean and the sheets/ blankets smelled good. The t.v. worked good for an older model, about a 28\" screen. The bathroom was clean but there was water spots everywhere, and we wiped the toilet seat off before sitting on it. The room was very dark, not the best lighting. We only heard one siren from an ambulance at around 10 pm. There was a group of individuals in the \"pool\" area at 6 am yelling at each other and one kept saying \"what da f***\". That was very rude and annoying. I believe the same group was up for several hours earlier banging on each others doors and being very loud.

We wanted an inexpensive, basic place for two nights, and weren't expecting much, but this is beyond dirty and uncomfortable. Three rooms all had sinks and bathtubs covered with cigarette burns, and it didn't even look like they took the time to wipe the surfaces down. Cracked tiles and old fixtures do not harm, but I washed the shower and sink myself before going near them and can confirm that they were not cleaned. Worn-out, STAINED sheets, and not just a spot, a lifetime of unsavory things happened on those sheets! Pilly blankets i was afraid to let touch my skin. The king size beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. Two rooms had broken security latches. One had what really looked like a blood stain on the carpet. The area is depressed and felt unsafe, even though we didn't have any encounters with shady characters. The odd part is that I saw housekeeping everyday. Just can't figure out what they were doing. It was quiet at the hotel, but the squalor and ancient beds made it impossible to get a decent night sleep.", "Date": "August 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cHello no\u201d", "Author": "moneybags58", "ReviewID": "UR36407797", "Content": "The rooms are dark and dingy.

I booked this hotel due to its extreme proximity to Pimlico Racetrack, the site of a very popular yearly music festival. I did read the reviews here but as there weren't many, thought I'd take the chance. This particular part of town goes from very bad to really nice pretty quickly, and I wasn't sure on what side of the coin this hotel would be. it's - seriously - the worst hotel I have ever seen, and I've stayed in some fairly dodgy places in spots like Lima and Mexico City. The paint is cracked and peeling. The pool, which has been filled with dirt, is similar to a vacant lot of the type I've seen in abandoned industrial parks. There were folks who looked very like stereotypical drug dealers hanging around in the parking lot. There is no elevator (there's one on the property but it doesn't work, and is dented and decrepit.) The bathroom tile was atrocious. I was afraid to set my bag down on the carpet in the room, much less sleep there for the night. So I hightailed it for whatever other hotel my GPS could find (there's a very nice Ramada and a Hilton barely three miles directly up Reisterstown Road from this joint.) The best part? This hotel tried to charge me $130 per night. Seriously. Then when I tried to return the keys, nobody answered the bell at the front desk. I called to tell them I wouldn't be returning and was spoken to rudely. I won't be happy if the full charge for this reservation appears on my credit card. The website for this hotel reveals nothing of its true sordid nature. No way would I recommend this place for a single traveler of either sex, or anyone who values the safety of his or her person or belongings. For some reason there's an Econolodge sign outside, and I think I'll call Choice Hotels when I get home to warn them they need to disassociate themselves with this property.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!

A pseudo-modern 1950's roadside motel that is so run-down and shabby it should not be licensed. The neighborhood can be described as 'bad part of town' or 'high crime area' or 'urban blighted area' or 'the Ghetto.' The street is where you put up your windows and lock the doors. The room was filthy and depressing. Walls painted an awful \"baby vomit green\" or if you remember the movie The Exorcist: \"Linda Blair green\" ... who picked out the awful color sheme? The place smelled of mildew and mold. Broken tiles in the bathroom. No lamps anywhere in the room just a week flourescent bulb in a cheap ceiling fixture. Too dark to read except in the bathroom. I am not a fussy person, if you read my other reviews I am charitable about places that others found wanting. I have stayed at Youth Hostels, college dorms, hotels in Third World countries as well 4 or 5 star accommodations in places like London, Paris, New York, Hong Kong and Bangkok. This place was scary! The worst I ever stayed in!! I tried to get out of my reservation, but the management was unsympathetic. I stayed only one night and fled the next morning, forfeiting the amount I spent for two nights. This motel caters to men who pick up the nastiest and cheapest streetwalkers and need the cheapest room they can find. Just as I was checking in - in a tiny room (no lobby) with the clerk behind a thick bullet-proof window, a guy with a disheveled mangy looking female checked in after me: it was sleazy and scary. Oh yes! Where there was once a pool, the concrete rectangular hole was filled with dirt! Get this: after dinner when I got back to the grim cell-like room, there were a couple of ragged homeless men sitting outside my room! Please, please run from this place! Do not consider staying here!
