Arrived at 10 :30pm no issues with booking in with our pre paid deposit. Young couple on the front desk made everything easy. Was given a non smoking room on the 9th floor. Room was clean and well maintained. Bedding sheets etc excellent. Shower and tolit was also clean and tidy although no body wash etc to use in shower but did have a dispenser on the wash basin that could be used as body wash. Tea and coffee making facilities were provided but the coffee provided was a combined coffee/sugar and milk powder. with no alternative provided. Our room was on the front and the main road is out the front. Didn't stop us sleeping after the 8hr trip from Australia but would suggest that if possible you ash for a rear or side facing room. Unfortunately I cannot comment on Breakfast as it is not provided on Sunday Morning the day we left. As a budget hotel for an overnight stay going on a cruise ($5:00 ride to cruise terminal) I would recomend it to others. but as the distance is a way from the airport it is probably not where you would want to stay if you arrived one night and flew out the next day.

The staff was nice enough to explain that the hotel was undergoing reservations, thus the location of the meal. Meals were decent with continental choices. However, breakfast food was limited to cereals, milk, tea, coffee, something fried, and something steamed. By the fourth day, we were a bit tired of what we were eating. Since the hotel is quite far from the tube and the crowd, it's quite difficult to get to the hawker areas. Plus side to this though is you are away from the noise and the crowd, best of all, you are located closer to Sentosa. The best way to get around from the hotel is to take the bus which is just a short walk away. This is how we got to Sentosa, Jurong Bird Park (bus then tube), and the Chinese Gardens (bus then tube). I would recommend staying here if you plan to explore the city and spend little time in your room.

The staff were very helpful in almost anything that we need. They are very friendly and accommodating. (especially those front desk officers at night). You call them, and they'll respond in no time. EXCELLENT FOR BUDGET TRAVELLERS We booked two rooms and the price is cheap, but the quality and ambience are much more than what you pay for. Especially in Singapore, where hotel rates are very high. LOCATION The downside of this hotel probably is its location. If you want to shop, see the city, stroll along, or at least eat,you would always need to ride a cab which costs around 7 dollars during the day, and around 14 dollars at night. And for a family of 6, we always needed to hire two cabs, so whatever we saved from booking at this hotel were staved off because of the cost of transportation. You could go by bus, though, It'll be much cheaper - 1.10 dollars. But, if you're not patient to wait, and you're not so sure what bus stop you're stopping to, taking a bus ride is a BIG NO! Whereas, if you book a hotel near Orchard Road -- everything is almost accessible. or even if you need to take a cab, it wouldn't cost you that much. BEST PART! I love the breakfast! (no pun intended) The menu is since time immemorial. =) hehe It comes with unlimited beans, hotdogs, chicken nuggets, baked potatoes, loaf of bread, butter, peanut butter, spreads, cereals, milk, coffee. You would be served exactly the same menu everyday. I'm sure the lady preparing the breakfast can already cook those food even with eyes closed and hands tied. My siblings and I really the unlimited servings of baked potatoes and chicken nuggets. But my dad and aunt said that after five days of stay, they felt nausea at the sight of beans and chicken nuggets.

Also, as other people have commented earlier, you would need to have some transportation to get yourself to food courts or shopping or whatever. There is absolutely nothing around the hotel. If you are going to downtown area, it would take extra US$20 per night for commuting if you take taxi, which would be another reason we have to discount the rate that they offer.

A better choice if you can get a booking is IBnb a bed and breakfast, walking distance from this hotel. We walked to the Outram train station from this location. Turn left after leaving the hotel, keep walking to till you reach the T junction, turn right and another 10 minutes you reach the Outram train station. No real complaints, if you want a good price you can't expect top accomodation. One complaint worth noting is that the pillows were very thin. As the rooms are small I would avise going out for tea or something similar and using the room as a spot to sleep.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elmhurst, New York", "Title": "\u201cReasonable accomodations\u201d", "Author": "NY11373", "ReviewID": "UR10779491", "Content": "I stayed 2 days at the Harbour Ville.

The room was kind of small, as was the bathroom. But it was very clean and comfortable. There is no clock, so better bring your own. I was on the 8th floor and you could hear the traffic in the street. That is not a problem for me, but maybe to someone not used to it. Also there is a church next door that rings it's bell often. The location is not really convientient to anything. It is a 5-10 minute taxi ride to Chinatown. Taxis are cheap and there is a bus that goes there to. There are no facilities nearby. There is a breakfast in the morning except on Sunday, but it is not very good. The guy in charge seemed to have a grudge.

I booked this hotel on Expedia as it received fair reviews and was quite cheap for Singapore. It is not within convenient walking distance from any of the touristy sites in Singapore, however, is very near a bus stop and is about 5 stops from Chinatown. Also, it gets regular taxi traffic if one prefers that mode of getting around. It is also fairly near the Harbourfront station area. Bus service in Singapore was 90 cents (Singapore) per person/per trip, which is quite cheap and several routes pass by the hotel. We used the bus service to get around while staying at Harbour Ville and they have the numbers of the busses that pass by their hotel on their business cards for your convenience. The rooms are small, but the AC works well and there was adequate hot water. The bathrooms are also small and the toilet areas tend to share real estate with the shower. Each room has a small TV that gets about 4-5 stations incl. a movie channel. Breakfast is served every day except Sunday and includes coffee/tea/juice, fried hot dog, cold baked beans, scrambled egg, toast with jam and peanut butter and possibly fried potato. Staff there were courteous and business-like, but don't expect to be romanced! A cabbie pointed out to us that the hotel has a reputation for some prostitution traffic, however, this wasn't as issue during our stay although we did see a woman who appeared to be on the job at about 1 AM. Certainly, this is at least partially due to the fact that the hotel is across the street from the industrial harbour area where ships load and unload and there are probably some visitors in town in there with some needs for female attention! Again, our rooms were quiet on our two seperate stays here, however. I suspect whatever traffic of that nature the hotel might get is reserved for floors other than where longer term occupants might be staying. I just thought this was important to note. We saw numerous Chinese and Malay tourists staying there while we were there. For our needs, this accommodation was perfectly fine and allowed us to save some money on our overhead while in Singapore.

I booked a four day stay with my wife and 2 kids by calling the hotel directly. I did this even if it cost me about US$20/night more than booking through Expedia or the like for 2 reasons: firstly - to verify that there would be no extra charges for 4 of us staying in 1 room (2 twin beds); secondly - to make sure that my reservation was verified and wouldn't get mixed up as some other reviewers claimed. We got our room on the 8th floor. It had 2 twin beds, a TV, a miniref, a small closet with 3 hangers but no dresser / cabinet. The bathroom was as expected, a bit bigger than usual I guess, but there is no shower divider - just a depression in the corner. They do however give you floor towels now, so no need to use a bath towel on the floor. Beware the red light! We accidentally turned off the switch beside the red light when we left the room, which shut off the water heater - it takes about 30 minutes build up a store of hot water again. Also, pulling the key holder from the wall switch shuts off the power to the whole room, including the ref. Good thing the kids milk in the ref didn't go bad while we were away. This is probably a common feature, but it was almost a whoopsy. We henceforth took the key of the holder, left the holder in the wall switch and did our touring with the key on our key ring (keep the Do Not Disturb sign on your door if you do this). The room was a long thin rectangle, not too spacious but everything fit, and we weren't there to enjoy the room. The room was very clean however, and more so the bathroom. The lobby is really small, with chairs to the far left, the front desk to your left, elevators to the right and sandwich display case to the far right. There's a small verandah out back where they serve breakfast - no room service. The hotel staff was courteous, polite, knowledgeable and helpful. For instance, we asked for the room to be cleaned up at 5pm, not the regular cleanup time. They came by in 15 minutes and swept up. On leaving, the lady at the front desk got up, went to the curb and called us a cab. Don't expect any eateries too close to the hotel, but a 10 min. walk takes you to Vivo City / Sentosa Bridge / Harbour Fronte Centre / MRT-NE1 whre you will find more than enough to feed you and your loved ones. In the other direction 10 min. walk along Kampung Bahru, across from the Singapore General Hospital there are a few of the famous food stalls. All in all, a great budget hotel.
