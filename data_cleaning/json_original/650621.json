The hotel was indeed clean but the lobby had a foul smell. The room was small but adequate and clean. The shower was awful, small and had louver doors that did not stay shut so there was water all over after every shower. The breakfast was good and the woman who ran the area was nice, kept the area clean and stocked with good foods. The front desk people were nice, helpful when checking in with a map and location of hotel. We did not walk to any attractions as it was rainy and the hotel was simply too far from most things including the Forum and Colesseum and of course Vatican City. I did not like the area around the Termini, it was heavily traveled and always busy with tons of people. Not the best area to be wandering around but we felt safe enough. We had a couple of meals near the hotel, not the greatest but good. Overall a clean, modern hotel and I believe it is popular because the price is right. I would stay closer to the areas most tourists go to Rome to see next time in Rome.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean, beautiful room.

They gave me a free room upgrade, which was awesome. The only thing I found not so great was it is not in walking distance of the major areas of Rome. I took taxis everywhere to avoid taking the train (except my last day from the Vatican), as I had been advised about pick pocketers. The Termini train station is very close, which made getting there from the airport very easy. If you can get to all your destinations in Rome on the train then you will be fine with this hotel. Or you can take cabs like I did. I like the modern look and cleanliness of the hotel. The morning breakfast was a little skimpy but it was enough for me to fuel up for exploring the city and then eat my heart away at many Italian restaurants. I felt very safe and comfortable in this hotel. The bed was a little firm for my taste, but after days of walking everywhere, it felt just fine and opening my windows to hear the sound of the city was awesome. My favorite hotel moment was the church bells going off at 7am in the distant. I would stay here again and get more acquainted with the train system and use less cabs.

The room is of a high standard for the price paid. I can hoestly say I think this hotel should be rated higher than a three star. I have stayed in a lot of up market hotels, but found the hospitality of the Yes to be second to none. I was sad to leave Rome and the Yes hotel.

The staff in Yes Hotel is so helpful that we didn't worry about anything in Rome. We were warm-welcomed by the reception in this hotel by Mr. Marcello, one of the most helpful staff in Yes Hotel. He clearly explained the locations, sightseeing spots, transportation, fees and itinerary to us and helped us to carry our luggage to another building us a door next to the reception, which has 2-4 stairs before entering our rooms. He could even speak fluent English, so we could communicate with him easily. Btw, he knows Spanish too! Apart from the warm greeting when we first arrived the hotel, we also think that the room was nice, which a comfortable bed, neat, clean and tidy room and decorations. We thought it's a pleasure to stay in this hotel. Though it's not a very big room (maybe we booked at the cheapest price:D) but it's definitely a warm, relaxed place to stay. It would be more appreciated if they have bath tub, but we also felt good with the shower! It's so close to the train station and the bus terminal, which only takes 5 to 10 mins to walk to. Also, Termini Station is the centre of Rome, so you can get to everywhere conveniently, even till midnight. The breakfast is alright cause you need to know that variety of choices of foods in breakfast is that not common in Europe. Hams, cheese, breads, tarts, cereals and eggs etc could be found and you can fill your stomach before you start your great journey in Rome!

The rooms we've had were both pretty small, and the shower was snug, but we didn't spend very much time there anyway so it didn't matter. Free wifi in lobby, 2 Euro per day in the room.

Upon arriving though, we were thoroughly impressed by how clean and modern the hotel looked. We had no issues with the cleanliness, nor the size of the rooms. We were further impressed by the free buffet breakfast offered the subsequent morning, given the prices that we had paid for our stay. We stayed for a total of 4 nights, and were also duly informed during one of the mornings of a transport strike that was occurring during the day. The advice offered by the receptionists were also reliable, which made touring Rome alot easier for us.

Don\u2019t waste money on taxis as the option with \u2018Terravision\u2019 or \u2018Sitbus\u2019 (which stop directly outside the airport and leave very frequently) is so easy. From first entering the hotel, you find a very clean, well organised and friendly place. The receptionist was ultra nice & helpful. There are large maps ready for visitors to take (we found ours invaluable when taking in the sites) Also, any questions you may have are answered and directions given. First class service, couldn\u2019t fault this.

Also, when asked for a take-away breakfast for our last morning to take on the train with us to Perugia, we were given a paper carrier each & told to take what we wanted for our trip. This hotel is so central & because of it\u2019s proximity to the Termini for buses/metro/trains it was ideal for going back to after a moorings\u2019 sightseeing for a rest, lunch & a cuppa before starting off again in the afternoon! There is a lift to all floors and a card key for your door. Room was well decorated and adequate space for us with 3 single beds & quality linens. There is a fridge, flat screen television and plenty of hanging space (even for 3 ladies!) The only slight peeve is that there is no tea/coffee making facilities. We were staying 3 nights and had hold luggage, so I was able to bring my own kettle, coffee/tea. When we asked for cups for our room, no problem, they were given with a smile. If you turn left on exiting the hotel and walk about 10mins, you will get to a supermarket where you can purchase milk, water etc. Decent prices for the basics. There are water fountains around everywhere which you can drink from or fill up your water bottle. This is spring water & safe to drink. It is cold & refreshing as you wonder around in the heat. Also it is free and will save you buying the overpriced small bottles. I could go on & on about the Yes hotel & Rome, but I think you can get the drift\u2026\u2026.

We didn't feel safe enough to want this. Our time was also wasted as we had to wait around reception for a room to be made up for us upstairs. Thirdly, every time you wanted to put the air conditioner on/off, you would have to contact reception to do it for you. This was painful. And fourthly, the heating racks didn't work in the bathroom, so if you washed any clothes- they stayed wet. Every other hotel we stayed in Europe had heating racks that worked. Apparently, theirs only work in winter. The staff did try to accommodate our needs. The rooms were clean. However, at then end of the day, I wouldn't come back.

First, the good. The hotel was clean, and in a convenient location only two short blocks from Termini, the main Roman train and Metro station, which made it very easy to get around Rome. While some reviews and guidebooks mentioned this as being a bad area, I never felt unsafe, even walking around after a late dinner, and there are plenty of tasty restaurants nearby. The breakfast was pretty good--cereals, croissants, meats, and several kinds of pastry. However, the little glasses for orange juice were so small that I had to return several times to drink enough. The room, however, was small, even by European standards. Mom and I were staying in a \"Superior Double\", but it was cramped, in large part because the hotel tried to stuff a Queen bed with a nearby Twin into a room better suited for two Twin beds. As it turned out, Mom didn't get the whole benefit of the Queen bed, because half of it was taken up by her suitcase; there was only space on the luggage rack for storing mine. There wasn't even enough space for someone to be sitting at the writing desk and another to get past to reach the door or the bathroom. I like a firm mattress, but the beds at Yes were the hardest I'd ever slept on, worse than my dorm in college, though Rome is so wonderfully exhausting that I still slept well on the Twin. Service was mixed; the man at the front desk who greeted us at checkin seemed somewhat surly, but others we saw on different days were better. However, for the last 36 hours of our stay, the Internet on our floor stopped working (we weren't the only customers complaining).

There were three of us in our party and we asked for 3 single beds in a quiet room, which was lovely. The room was an adequate size, which was very modern and the bathroom was very clean with a great shower! The location was ideal for travelling all around the historic sites of rome via the Metro and a good bus service if required. As soon as we arrived we were checked in, the desk clerk was very helpful and gave us a map and outlined all the sites and how to get to them. I'd read on Trip adviser and other sites that Stazione Termini is an unsafe place, but we didn't feel this was the case! We never felt in danger at anytime and I would recommend this location highly. Don't get me wrong it's not the best area, and there is a lot of graffitti, but most people in the area were welcoming and friendly, especially the owners and staff at a lovely Italian restaurant on the same road as the hotel, called Donati which was recommended by the hotel. We liked it so much we went twice and we were only in Rome for a three day trip! The food was lovely and the waiters were very friendly and helpful. Complimentary Limoncello for us on our second evening with them...yummy! We booked our airport transfer with Terravision which for 8 euros each return, was excellent value!

It is extremely close to the main train station Termini and from there you can go everywhere by metro, tram & bus. The staff was very friendly and they gave us a map and extra information about Rome's cultural week. A valuable tip because most entrances to highlights were free of charge this week ! Our room was at the back of the building so very quiet. Didn't hear any traffic noise of trains. The church clocks waked us every morning at 7:00 a.m. which was fine. The room is modern, clean, had a flat screen tv with channels in Italian and also TVE, TV5, BBC, MTV and CNN. There are amenities provided: shower & shampoo gel, shower cap and soap. We got clean towels every day and the room was made up every day. Breakfast was great with toast, buns, croissants, donuts, cake, pie, cornflakes, yoghurt, crackers, cheese, meat, eggs, etc. Check out time was 10:30 but they have a luggage room and asked if we would store our luggage for the rest of the day. There are a few minor details, actually not worth mentioning. - the toilet seat was a bit wiggling - the heating system was hard to switch off, but maybe it was me not understanding it - after 6 days of white bread breakfast I would loved to have some brown bread or fresh fruit, because I am a vegetarian there was only sweet/sugar breakfast stuff - the sheets weren't replaced for 6 days Tip 1: make your reservation on their site and pay cash on arrival, this saves you money ! Tip 2: ask the reception for wifi it's free for one hour ! Right after check out they sent me an email with a survey so I wrote these things down and I am sure they will do something about it, because they gave me the impression to do anything to improve their hotel quality.

As usual your comments were spot on. PROS * Room - My room was spotless, and the recent renovations are appreciated. Yes the room was small, but if you go to a European boutique hotel expecting to get a Marriott-sized room you will be disappointed every time. Also be prepared to bring your own alarm clock and iron as the room had neither (again common in small European hotels). The bed was VERY firm, which made my back quite happy. *Location - Roma Termini is a very short walk from the hotel. Since I took the train from the airport I was concerned that I'd have to lug my suitcase all over town, but 3 blocks later I was in the lobby checking in. In addition, Termini is the only station in town where both the A and B subway lines stop so it is really easy to get to anywhere in the city. *Service - The front desk staff was very helpful and were more than happy to answer any questions or give you advice on where to eat, what to see, etc. CONS *Breakfast - nothing to write home about at all. A bland European spread with deli meats, cheeses, bread, cereal, overcooked eggs, and mini hot dogs masquerading as sausages. If possible I would recommend skipping the breakfast option when booking. There are plenty of spots at Roma Termini where you can get a cheap and much tastier breakfast. *Location - the Termini area is a little run down, but it's not that bad and I felt perfectly safe walking alone at night. Having said that, if you want a nice dinner you may have to hop on the Metro as restaurants in the neighborhood are few and far between. *Climate control - while sleeping I like the room a bit chilly (65F - 18C), but the thermostat would go no lower than 71F - 22C. Thankfully there was a window I could open so it ended up not much of a big deal. Even with the cons I was very happy with my room.

We chose this hotel for our last, stopover, night in Rome, having arrived in Rome by train from Venice in the afternoon on our return journey, and due to leave Rome airport the next morning. Thus, it was really only a place to sleep for one night. Proximity to the railway station (Rome Termini) was a priority, and the location of this hotel was brilliant in that regard. It\u2019s easy to find from the Termini train station using a standard tourist map of Rome, once you work out where you have exited the huge Termini. It also means that getting around Rome itself, whether by the underground Metro system or by bus (including the open-top double decker tourist buses), is easier \u2013 just go to the Termini for the outgoing journey, and make sure that your return trip is also going to the Termini. The reception staff at the Yes Hotel were friendly and helpful, providing maps and arranging for a maxi-taxi at a given time. Check-in was prompt and efficient and our rooms were all ready. Booking and payment over the internet was straightforward, and we got a good deal price-wise in this way. The room (and ensuite), though small, was clean, comfortable and air-conditioned. No complaints in this regard. The self-serve breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was a bit disappointing. The juices were powdered, whilst the hot food (scrambled eggs, beef bacon and little sausages) was cold, as were the hard boiled eggs (we were eating at 8.00am; it has probably been put in the tray at least an hour beforehand). Cold boiled eggs you can handle \u2013 you eat them in salads; not so bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs. The yoghurt was dispensed through an ice-cream machine, and was a bit watery but not too bad with the tinned fruit. There were pre-packaged pastries, cereals and you could make toast. For a country that thrives on coffee, the coffee from the vending machine was a huge disappointment \u2013 some found it undrinkable; instant would have been better. I know I\u2019m harping on about the breakfast, and in fact, apart from the cold hot food and terrible coffee, it was quite serviceable, especially for the price. I\u2019ve had worse in the US. They should probably drop the hot food option \u2013 better not to do it at all than to do it badly. For the price, no one would criticise them for not having bacon & eggs; but you deserve to be scolded for serving up cold food.

There are a couple internet cafes nearby that offer better value, if less convenience. It's steps from Termini station, which means you're a short walk to an array of buses and both Metro lines. Rome is pretty compact, so if the weather is nice and your mobility good, you can walk to some major sights. There's nothing special about the hotel's neighborhood, but day or night we saw nothing \"sketchy\" like a previous reviewer described the area.

We found the hotel based on comments from this site and were not disappointed. The hotel is located an easy walking distance from the railway station even with a couple of cases. However, a word of warning - if you arrive by rail from Civitavecchia or Fiumicino Airport you will most likely exit the station on to Via Giovanni Giolitti. Here you will find very helpful taxi drivers telling you your hotel is 3 km away. They will charge anything from 25 euros to over 100 Euros depending on your nationality for a drive around the station to the hotel. As the platforms for these destinations are located about 10 mins walk away from the main station, I strongly suggest you stay in the station and head for platforms 1-24. Then head right and cut through the main station - unmistakeable with shops, bars restaurants etc. Cross the main road ahead of you - Via Masarla - as you exit. Head down Via Marghera and take the first left on to Via Magenta towards the hotel. This is no more than a 15 minute walk and will avoid the extortionate cost of a taxi.

Before booking we had checked hotel reviews on TripAdvisor and were impressed with the recommendations. We were not disappointed as we pulled our luggage in through the sliding glass doors. The area around the hotel doesn't look safe (especially at night) but me and my two friends (we are all younger females) walked up and down the streets late in the evening after dinner many times with no issues whatsoever. The Yes Hotel is about one/two blocks to the left of the front entrance of the Termini station (where all of the buses converge at) so it was an extremely convenient location for travelers that need and want to use the Termini station as their base area. The hotel room itself is smaller than what you may be accustomed to but for us the big items that made the room great were that it had air conditioning (though we couldn't make it any warmer than 21 degrees Celcius so we would turn it off after awhile since it would get chilly in the room but it didn't matter since there WAS an air conditioner), a safe to lock your valuables up, complimentary breakfast in the morning (sliced meats and cheeses, pastries, cereal, caffe, juices, yogurt - not a hot breakfast but definitely a good one especially when you wake up hungry and want to save money), daily maid service, a proper bathroom with a hair dryer, and the circuit breaker box in your hotel room (my friend popped a circuit plugging in her hair dryer and it was easily fixed since the box was in the room). The hotel has a contemporary modern design that was very pleasing and all public areas were very clean and well maintained. The price to use the internet service was a very affordable (pay the 10 euro fee!) and it was very handy that the hotel has wi-fi. We met multiple staff members on our stay there and they were all very pleasant. You hand them your room key as you leave and they hand it back to you as you come back to the hotel which I think was a great idea since you didn't have to worry about losing the room key or having it stolen as you were meandering around Rome. Also you plug in your room key into the room key slot when you enter the room to make all of the electronics/lights in the room work as an FYI. The hotel has a breakfast bar/wine bar but there is also a bar nearby that is between the hotel and the Termini station that is packed at night and seems like a good place to drink and mingle and there are a few restaurants in the nearby vicinity. The Termini station also has a few shops and food establishments if the need to shop hits you. The only things we found not desireable about the hotel were the air conditioning issue (they just need to make sure you can make the temperature in the room go higher than 21 degress Celcius) and the fan in the bathroom needs to turn off a little faster when the lights come off (it turns on when you turn on the bathroom light but not the mirror light so if you want just light in the room for a little without the bathroom fan turning on, use the mirror light instead). Those were small issues and they did not deter from our amazing stay at this hotel in Rome. I will definitely book here again when I come back to Rome (I did throw a coin into the Trevi fountain so I should be coming back!) and it made my first visit to this country a lot less stressful since it was an amazing price for our own room and I didn't hate coming back at night to this hotel!", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWe do not recommend this hotel !!!!\u201d", "Author": "jayjay020", "ReviewID": "UR35278900", "Content": "In the breakfast room there are two ladies who speak Arabic or Russian and mock customers continuously, especially the one with the red nail polish to the toes.

The beds felt fine to us. Everyone talks about the hard beds in europe. We have a high quality mattress at home and the hotel mattress was almost the same feel. Linnens were of high quality also and the room was spotless. One of the cleanest rooms that I have seen in all of my travels. The highlight to the 1 day stay was the morning breakfast. We enjoyed some of the best cold cuts and cheese that we had in our 2 weeks in Italy and France. The two beautiful women that were taking care of the breakfast area were very proud of the product they served and it showed. The cold cuts and cheese are cut in the kitchen right next to the serving area and are as fresh as can be. They were GREAT! The coffee was good and strong like we expected they even had an automatic espresso machine that you woked yourself. The rolls and yogert , toppings and the cereal,OJ and fresh milk were all great. The eating area like the rest of the hotel was spotless. This hotel woked great for us and exceeded our expections after reading reviews on TA. We took a tour of Rome the next morning which ended at our cruise port. On the tour we found out that it was not only the area by the Yes hotel that had grafitti which was light compared to the rest of the city.

We argued this as advised in my tourist guide book, but he became angry and insulting, and at one point I thought he was going to stop the taxi and make us get out. We finally agreed to pay 35 euros but told him to forget a tip! He had his revenge, however, cos he dropped us off a street away from our hotel, which is not well signed.

After a weekend stay in late October 2008, would I choose Yes again for a future Roman holiday? Maybe, but probably not. Here's why. Pros: (1) Location (also see Cons): Yes is just a few minutes' walk from Rome's Termini Station, which means that you can get from Fiumicino Airport via the Leonardo Express train to the hotel in under an hour. As with many big Euro cities, the area around Rome's major train station is not great -- but it is safe and replete with cheap eats from around the world (although I can't imagine why anyone would want to eat anything other than local cuisine in one of the world's greatest food cities). Many of Rome's attractions are withing walking distance (mostly long walks, I must add) or short taxi or metro rides from the Yes. (2) Ambience and decor: Yes looks good, from the small but smart lobby to the modern, attractive rooms. I stayed in a double, which wasn't large but larger than your average Euro three-star room. The bathroom was quite large, with a full bath and \"watering-can\"-style rain shower. My room had a newish, wall-mounted flat-screen TV and decent A/C. (While Rome wasn't hot in late October, temps did reach nearly 70C/21F during the day, and the room was a bit stuffy.) The decor was quite nice: dark wood, rich contrasting fabrics. Cons: (1) Front-desk policies: Perhaps this is normal for mid-range hotels in Rome, but I was surprised when the evening front-desk clerk who checked me in asked me to pay for my stay in full in advance. I'd used a website other than Yes's to book my stay, and he said that had I used the hotel's website, I would have received an e-mail confirmation of reservation clearly stating the advance-payment requirement. Still. I put the amount on my credit card, only to receive another surpise: a demand (well, request, but it didn't seem to be wavable) to leave a deposit against the (electronic) room key. I left 5 Euros. Breakfast was included in my rate (135 Euros/night) but the available wifi internet was not, so I shelled out another 10 Euros for 24 hours of that. (2) Location/street noise: The downside of Yes's convenient location was the attendant street noise from people and cars in the very busy area around the hotel. It wasn't bad late at night, but I don't recommend the hotel for light sleepers. Yes is located in two adjacent but not adjoining buildings; the main building has just two floors, and the annex -- in which I stayed -- has rooms just on the ground floor. Again, the room was comfortable, and the large windows -- pretty, but with nothing to see from them -- were pretty well insulated. (3) Breakfast: I wouldn't pay extra for Yes's breakfast, which was basic: rolls, a few cold cuts, cheese, watery yoghurt, food-service coffee from an urn, and dry cereals. Not inspiring by any means, but with good food and arguably the world's best coffee available on every block, no one needs a hotel breakfast in Rome. (4) Beds: I know this is a common Euro-hotel trick (especially in the two- and three-star range), but I was disappointed to see that my \"double\" bed was actually two narrow twins covered with a double sheet. I felt the crack between the two beds, and while it wasn't a sleep wrecker (the bed was fairly firm and comfortable overall), I wouldn't take such a \"double\" bed again. Upshot: I give the three-star Yes 3 out of 5. I'd consider staying again, but only for 100 Euros or less. Rome appears to have many good (better?) three- and four-star hotels in or near that price point, so Yes is definitely a maybe for Roman-holiday lodging.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stevenage, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThree x Yes!\u201d", "Author": "ukwlb", "ReviewID": "UR20933103", "Content": "Stayed at the Yes Hotel with two girlfriends whilst on a site-seeing trip to Rome.

Look on the Yeshotelrome.com website as it has a list of local restaurants you can get a 10% discount from when staying at Yes hotel. There is also a supermarket 2 min walk, and the termini station is also about 5 mins walk. I would recommend this hotel, and would have absolutely no hesitation in staying at this hotel again, it was lovely. I would also recommend buying the tourbus tickets (yellow buses are religious tours, green are parks and red is basically everything). We took the red bus, you can hop on and off as many times as you want in 24 hours - they are excellent value and a great way of seeing everything without walking everywhere and spending a fortune in taxi fares. if you do catch a taxi, always ask them to put the meter on - they have a habit of charging a little bit extra if they think you don't know the area (which we do).", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cyes sweet\u201d", "Author": "tbacheller", "ReviewID": "UR20102792", "Content": "The room was very nice.

The hotel is in an excellent location but has two different signs on it calling it the 'New York Hotel' and another name , I think it was 'Giancarlo Hotel'. If you look very closely in the glass door, there is a subtley inscribed 'Y' and 'H' and the word 'YES' in very small letters??? The maps that you can buy there or indeed are given to you by tour guides, etc are ALL wrong and ALL different from eachother so it took us a while to find this hotel. It was only by asking at other hotels that we did so look out for this. You have to look for the Via Marsala, which runs directly along the side of the Termini station and the Via Magenta runs parallell with this road. It's about a 2 min walk from Termini; fabulous once you know. Apart from this, the actual hotel is very nice. It's immaculately clean, although the rooms are small. The breakfast room is tiny and I imagine in high season you would have to queue. It must only seat about 24 people maximum. The breakfast was adequate, nothing special but ok; rolls, croissants, jams, ham, cheese, a few cereals, tinned fruit and yoghurt. The coffee was undrinkable so we just drank tea every day. Our room looked out onto the bins and a sort of 'courtyard', if you could call it that. A horrible view so the shutters were kept closed. It was so warm in the room on our first night and we couldn't work out how to turn on the air con, (we never did). We finally opened the window a tiny bit at about 3 in the morning. This is in January and yet an infected mosquito got in and bit my face and hand quite badly!! I had a swollen face and hand for the rest of our stay. So do not open the windows unless you have to. (This is probably obvious but we couldn't sleep in that room without air). The open topped tour buses are good if you only have a few days and they stop on Via Marsala, which is about 2 mins from the hotel and City Sightseeing costs 14 Euros each for 2 days. Always make sure you know when and where they are going to pick you up though as they are very unclear and finish at about 5.30pm, possibly leaving you stranded somewhere. It can be very difficult to find your way back without proper street signs or correct maps. I would recommend this hotel because it was clean and in an excellent location. The staff were friendly enough and the breakfast was included in the price and was adequate. When I return to Rome very soon hopefully, I will stay at Hotel Colosseum, a brilliant hotel, which I thoroughly recommend. It was fully booked for this weeks visit.. The Yes Hotel is good but the Colosseum is much better and about the same price.

This may have been a genuine technical issue (and at least we got a room somewhere) - but if this was really the case, there should have been more explanation and support provided. It seemed that this was simply business as usual for both hotels. Indeed, unlike some other properties, the Yes Hotel adds a paragraph covering this possibility in its up-front terms and conditions - suggesting to me at least that this is a common practice.

My husband and I took our 11 year old son to Rome (somewhere our son had wanted to go since learing about the Romans at school). First I must say how easy the hotel is to find. We came off the train from the airport, and then turned right leaving the station via the exit at the end - few minutes walk thru the station in the shade! On leaving the station cross the cobbled road and the Hotel is easy to find a street back and to the left. We really couldnt believe how quick we were in our hotel room on leaving the station. In fact the train from the airport only took half an hour and we brought our tickets from the little shop opposite where you come up from the plane terminal. The man in the shop was very helpfull and we brought our return ticktes then and there as they are only valid once you valildate then in the yellow machine at the end of the platform so buying the return tickets there ment we didnt have to worry about getting them at the termini. The hotel reception gave us our key quickly and a helpfull map. So, happy to be in the room with no major hicups and no kid hissy fits! We were again pleased with the room - just right we had a family room, a double bed not a big gap between that and the single but its all you need and the bathroom worked really well tto again not big but just enought to make it ok. We all said we would like to go back to Rome and if we did we would stay at the Yes Hotel again. Breakfast is nothing special but its not rubbish either - stuff to wet your whistle and get you off on your day out really - a couple of times we sat at a table that hadnt been cleared but the waiter soon came and took the dirty stufff away - the breakfast room is small with not much room to move which could have made the start to the days a mare - watch the two steps if you sit at the end - you will forget they are there and stumble down - every morning we watched the same people do it! Staying here made every where a doddle to get to. 2 mins from the termini so 2 mins from the two tube lines. Still you will walk your feet off and to be honest my feet still have not forgiven me for the pounding I gave them - I read lots about Rome b 4 we left , keen to make the most of the time we would spend there and nothing I read really prepared me for how my feet would feel - I truly am active, being a mum 2 a sport crazy boy - I though my sensible clark walking shoes would stand up to it but they never - please please get the right shoes. Rome. Well, we could not choose a best bit, it was all best! Look up on here the Rome guide and the food guide - we went to the ice cream places and the two that are the oldest are the best and one of them is two blocks the other side of the termini - well worth a detour on your way home - do look it up you wont be sorry it is wellworth it. Pay for what you want at the pay desk then take your ticket to the counter. Our son loved the granite. The other one is on the list as near the Pantheon. When you go to the Colosseum walk past the enternace and go towards the Arc go up the little hill and past the fist kiosk then buy your ticket at the next kiost which is the ticket office for the Roman Forum, when we were there there was no que at all, not a single person (if you are travelling with kids be sure to have acopy of their passport then you will only have to pay half for them if you dont have it they will expect you to pay full price for them) So if you have time do go in this bit it is soo interesting and so old its hard to get it that its still there! If you dont want to go around this bit go back to the Colosseum and take a look at the que - you may not be able to see but go to the left and you will come to a fast lane saying groups go up there and put your ticket in the machine and your in and you dodged the 2 hour que! Like any city it is easy to eat rubbish! We had a 'rubbish' meal the first night neat the Hotel right at the other end of the same street the hotel is in. The best meal we had was two roads back from the hotel in Via Millie - we went on our last night and wished we had found it sooner. The other meals we had around Rome where good but I cant remember then to tell you. I drank house red with every meal - lovely! We spent one morning at a swimming pool - we had read we could use a near by hotel pool so aske dthe hotel reception to get the details for us - which they did but she also told us about a place at the end of the blue tube line EUR Palasport, where she herself goes, so we went there as it was cheaper. It took 20 mins on the tube and it was easy to find across the road on the left the enternace is on the road side - we walked thru the park and had to walk all the way around the outside to get to the enternace! It was good fun, you must wear a swimming hat as you do allover Italy. It was really funny watching the localls doing a water exercise class with the 'typical' instructor standing in the front! I am sure I cant write about it even tho it was so funny! One of those you would have to be ther things! It was a good move as we ahd all been on the go for 4 days and our son played in the water for 4 hours - we didnt see him - apart from checking on him! We left there and headed for Piazza Navona and sat for a while watching the world go by! Other than the usual places that are a must we also had a look in the Farari (sorry if i spelt it wrong - I am a girl) shop - not sure if that was a little extra for our son or my husband and as I messed up the coin throwing in the trevi andf had to go back to do it again ( I still dont know if I got it right as we went back after dinner and so after wine - at least we got to see the trevi at night) I didnt mind the detour to the car shop! All in all a fantastic trip and a gem of a hotel! If you had read allthis waffle then you deserve to know that as soon as we arrived we left our bags and headed of to the other sideo f the termini to get an open top tour bus - which was great for getting our bearings and was nice to sit on the top and get our fisrt look at Rome. We sat on it all the way round which took a couple of hours. It was well worth the money - was kind of like we saw it all then and there! Wont every forget our sons face as he had his first view of the colosseum! Turned a corner on the bus and there it was at the end of the road d d derrrrrrrrrr the Colosseum! Go a bit more look to the side and there it is Circo Massimo! St Peters and the Vatican, the river and the old old Castel Sant' Angelo....................................Go, have fun, enjoy!

We went to Rome in the highest season, which is on August, so it was pretty hard to find hotel to stay. But we managed to find this hotel from google since 3 months earlier. Yes hotel is quiet new, so it was pretty hard to find the reviews from other travellers. When I openned tripadvisor website 3 months ago, I only found one review of the hotel and I am quiet surprised actually to see the increasing number of the reviews. That means good! So anyway, even so, finally we decided to book it cause I preferred to choose a new hotel than to gamble on hotels which post their back 15-20 years pictures on their websites. Plenty of old hotels in Rome, so I would prefer a new one than the old one. In the beginning we thought that the hotel is quiet far from Termini station, but actually it's very very close and not more than 5 minutes walking. If you get out from the east door of Termini Station (next to track no.1) you need to take left, and turn right on Via Vicenza, and on the first cross road of Via Vicenza take left and the first building on the left is the Hotel. But I must warn you that the name is pretty confusing. On the door it does say \"Yes Hotel entrance\" but on the board says \"Hotel New York\". ?? We stayed the three of us, so we booked a triple room, which has one large size bed and one single bed. The room is very clean, and rather small, maybe because they just add one single bed on the double room, but it still OK. Beside the beds, they have one flat LCD TV with some Italian channels, table with chair, small fridge and a wardrobe with locker. The Bathroom is clean and have everything that you need, towels, soap and shampoo gel, and it is not that small although they do not have bath tub. Everything on the room was computerized. For example if you open the window, automatically the Air Conditioner will be off. You also can set up the door message (don't disturb, please clean the room) electronically from inside the room. The window can be closed well, so although we were on the second floor, we did not hear anything from outside. You do not need to worry about the noise from outside the hotel. For breakfast, you have option to include it on the room or not. If you do not want hassle, i suggest to take the room including the breakfast. They have small dining room which can be fit for more or less 24 people, everything was new and nice. I heard from some friends who visited Rome, that the breakfast in most Rome hotels were a bit disappointing because consisted with croissants, toaster bread and coffee in small portions only. But fortunately in Yes Hotel, they serve continental breakfast including croissant, plain bread, various toaster bread (biscuito), good cheese and ham, 3 types of cereal, several types of jam. For drink, they have coffee, milk, water, tea, and not so fresh juice. They also serve the fruits salad. I think all the Hotel staffs can speak English well, and they were also very friendly and helpful since from the beginning when we booked. Overall I think Yes Hotel is really good deal. We paid 110 Euro for triple room including breakfast on the high season. If you pay with credit card I think the price is a bit higher around 124 Euros/night. I highly recommend this hotel for families or someone who travels to Rome.

We stayed one night at this hotel on Aug 12 after our Mediterranean cruise. We booked this hotel after reading through numerous Rome hotel reviews for the reasons of location, price and the fact that the hotel was brand new. We already had the expectation of a new 3-star hotel, but when we arrived, the impression we had was nothing short of a 'WOW'. The interior design is very modern, clean and fashionable (check out the bamboo-mat like designer floor tiles and the slick elevator in the lobby). The hotel also has quite a state-of-the-art energy saving control system that is a win-win for the environment and the hotel. For each room, there is a card sensor where you place a key card close to it to open the door. The card sensor also has a 'Do Not Disturb' indicator to replace the traditional door-knob hanger. Once you are in the room, there is a card slot with flashing blue light where you insert the key card to turn on the light and start the air conditioner. Next to the card slot is the temperature control for the air conditioner. It starts at 23 degree Celsius and you can adjust the temperature up and down. Setting it to 19 degree Celsius during the day and 24 degree Celsius at night worked well for us. Another power-smart feature is the air conditioner shuts off automatically if the window is open. The bathroom fan is also sensor controlled but you need to at least turn on the main bathroom light to activate the sensor. When you leave the room, taking out the key card from the card slot automatically turn off everything after a few minutes. The lights in the corridors are also motion-sensor controlled. They automatically turn on when someone approaches and turn off minutes later when there is nobody present. Another smart design feature is the use of floor tiles instead of carpet throughout the hotel. The floor tiles won't soil and trap allergens so they stay new and it is the best thing for allergy suffers like me. Our group stayed at a deluxe (quadruple) room and two superior (triple) rooms at \u20ac114 and \u20ac134 each respectively. The quadruple room (room 215) was very roomy and the triple rooms (rooms 216 and 202) were good sized as well. All our rooms have a large bathroom (by Rome standard) and a flat screen TV. My room (215) faced the front but either the street was very quiet or the window was very sound-proofed, I didn't hear any road noise at all. Other reviewers' comment about noise from the corridor and next rooms did not materialize for us. The fire exit route map is on the back of the door. The fire exit was just next to my room and the exit door has a big red cross-bar that you push to open. The hotel is located one block away from the main terminal station on a small street. We didn't need a map. We just followed the direction on the hotel confirmation email and it took us less than two minutes to walk from the station to the hotel. There was no hotel sign though. The hotel name is only on the entrance glass door but you can look for the big Hotel Milani sign as it is just opposite Yes Hotel across the street. The area is actually quite safe as it is packed with hotels and there are more tourists than locals on the streets. The staff at the front desk was very helpful with directions, bus/train information and restaurant suggestions. We also found out from the staff that there was a supermarket just down the street. The breakfast was basic (no real fruit juice) but adequate, and the staff did replenish the items when they ran out. I'm not a coffee drinker but my wife thought the coffee was okay. The only negative thing with the hotel is they don't accept single-night bookings for Saturdays. Otherwise, we would have stayed there also for the night prior to boarding our cruise. Instead, we had to stay one night at Hotel Columbia (our second choice) which had an excellent roof-top breakfast but at twice the room rate as Yes Hotel.", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "greater manchester", "Title": "\u201cexcellant hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "jroyle", "ReviewID": "UR8429688", "Content": "Just returned from 4 days in rome.

I work in the hospitality industry so I'm always a little extra picky about hotels. People should be able to pay a reasonable rate for a nice clean hotel in a good location. The Yes Hotel meets completely meets that criteria. The rooms are spacious, very clean, modern and simple. I can't think of a single complaint, from the front desk staff to the showers. Rome is very hot in June and the Yes Hotel was always refreshing and relaxing to come back to after a long day of sight seeing. Rooms - The rooms look exactly like the pictures on their official website. We had a superior room with three beds. Our room had plenty of space for and more than enough room for our luggage. Loved it!!! Nice flat screen TV with 2 or 3 English channels, which is hard to find any where in Rome. Make sure to keep your windows closed when the air conditioning is on. For those Americans who might think this is silly it's actually very smart because it conserves energy which is good for the environment. I only wish more American hotel chains would have the same technology. Cleanliness - Impeccably clean and sanitary. The bath rooms are nice and they come with large towels. The shower is great and good water pressure. I would agree with other readers about the bathroom fan. It's a little annoying but definitely not enough to bypass staying at this hotel. Location - The hotel is 2 minutes walking distance from Termini Station which is perfect for taking the train to all the tourist spots. Navigating the city wasn't hard because your getting on at Termini station which gives you access to the A and B line. Instead of having to backtrack to Termini to switch train lines. Perfect location if your navigating the city on your own. Don't waste your money taking a taxi from the airport, instead take the direct Leonardo Express Train which drops you off at Termini station and there are no stops. Very Very convenient and only 11 Euro!!!! The streets are fine during the day and just use caution when walking around at night. It's not a reflection of the hotel but Rome in general which is a urban city. If your expecting quite Italian streets, grow up and realize the world is not designed to suit delicate sensibilities. It's also nice being close to Termini because there are lots of stores at Termini. Perfect for picking up a quick sandwich or things you forgot at home like toothpaste or an extra pair of pajamas. Over all I would high recommend this hotel to anyone and their families. I hope you enjoy", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Yes Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d650621-Reviews-Yes_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$98 - $228*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Magenta 15</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "650621", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/52/57/da/lobby-view-reception.jpg"}}
