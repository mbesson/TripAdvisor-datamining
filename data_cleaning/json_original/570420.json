In order to get into Rome we drove to the Laurentina metro station from where we arrived at the Colloseum within 20 minutes. Parking was safe and cheap!the hotel is conveniently located near the motorway (about 10 minutes) and traffic is not chaotic (like in Rome). Plenty of parking at the hotel too.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cSwiss quality in Italy\u201d", "Author": "Begemoth", "ReviewID": "UR94057838", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with my wife for 4 nights. This hotel is run by a Swiss family couple and it means that everything in this hotel has unsurpassed Swiss quality: the room, the clearness, the service! Family is very helpful and personal. Breakfasts are more in Western European style then in Italian one. Free Wi-Fi all over the hotel. The only drawback is location outside GRA. So you are to take a bus or a cab to reach the nearest subway station. But the countryside location equals peaceful nights. The hotel is highly recommended for those who rent a car in Rome or don't afraid to spend 40-45 minutes to go to city centre. It was a great stay, thanks!", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marini Park Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d570420-Reviews-Marini_Park_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$46 - $132*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Castel di Leva 258</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00134</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "570420", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/5c/89/5c89940a171632c48d4604a24d0f73a83large.jpg"}}
