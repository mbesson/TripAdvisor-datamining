Wouldn't stay anywhere else.\u201d", "Author": "Elphaba175", "ReviewID": "UR115250137", "Content": "I don't have a single complaint to make about this absolutely wonderful B&B, in spite of some of the other reviews. It was the perfect beginning to an amazing holiday, and we had a far more pleasant, enjoyable and much better serviced experience in this 3* B&B than we did in the 4* Hotel Carlton on the Grand Canal in Venice. Casa Linnea is a B&B owned by Anna Eriksson and her husband, both of whom were absolutely lovely. The communication with Anna via email when booking etc was fantastic - she always replied quickly, in perfect English, and was very helpful.We were also told in our emails that we would need to pay upon arrival for our stay, so not a problem. Upon arrival, we were let into the building after buzzing as instructed, and were met by Anna's husband who was absolutely lovely. The payment was without problems - he did not have the change to give us but we were assured his wife would give it to us the next day, which she did instantly. When we told him it was our first time in Italy, he was quick to provide us with a large map and mark us a safe and easy route to follow that would enable us to see all the sights we wanted to see. We were also told they lived in their own flat above and were available if we needed any help with anything. The location of the B&B is amazing. We were ten minutes from the Castel Saint Angelo and ten minutes from the Vatican. It was then only short and very easy walks to get to the Trevi Fountain, Altar of the Fatherland and Coliseum. It's also close to the Spanish Steps but we managed to go the wrong way and missed it! We asked for a twin room because we weren't sure how they would be with same-sex couples, so we ended up with the triple room. Needn't have worried about the bed situation - the two singles were pushed together like a double anyway! We were astonished by how beautiful the room was - very vintage and rustic looking. It was massive, with a beautiful, large bathroom too, with a hot, powerful shower. As someone else pointed out, the rooms have windows that open onto a six floor atrium. We, however, had no problem with noise. Yes, we could hear people talking below us but it wasn't too loud at all, and it was nice to feel like you were in the heart of Rome living amongst the locals. It was also a lovely addition to the stay hearing someone playing their saxophone during the middle of the day. Breakfast - I don't get why so many people complain about this. Yes, it's basic but it is a B&B, not a 5* hotel. It's run by Anna and her husband, but they do have to maintain the B&B and their own apartment, and for what was at the time (don't know if they've extended it) only a three bedroom B&B, why spend so much money on hams, cheeses, cereals, fruits, yogurts etc that might have been wasted? Unless you're living the high life, I don't really think everyone sits at home on a Monday morning and cracks out the speck and parma ham, the three cheeses and the bacon, before their croissaint and jam anyway! The breakfast was ample, and freshly bought by Anna every day. My partner needs a good, and reasonably large breakfast to make it through until lunch time, and I thought this would never be enough, but it kept her going until tea time! There was milk, tea, coffee and orange juice whenever you wanted, and yes you served yourself in the mornings but you do that at the Hotel Carlton breakfast buffet in Venice too. No big deal. And yes, you wash your own plate, but you've only used the one! I really liked the self-service thing - felt like I was at home in Italy. There's a fantastic little restuarant just opposite Casa Linnea too called Raf's. Amazingly friendly staff and stunning food. Went there every night. Anna was also extremely helpful when it came to sorting a taxi to the station. She was away the morning we wanted it, but was more than happy to book it for us from where she was. We didn't want to bother her with it so she left us instructions when she dropped off the breakfast that morning. In all, the best stay I've had in any hotel, B&B, motel etc...anywhere. And we've stayed in some pretty damn nice places. You felt like part of a family, like they cared about you, and we were well and truly looked after and kept safe. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Rome. Thank you, Anna, for being so hospitable and caring.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "violet67", "ReviewID": "UR88198357", "Content": "Casa Linnea is a small place, relaxing after long walks in central Rome (true walking distance to many sights).

Both of us have stayed in several B/Bs in Europe and the United States. The good news: Location, location, location! This bed and breakfast is situated quite well and within walking distance of major historical sites and museums. Restaurants and shopping are very near. The proprietor provided very helpful maps and area advice, as well as calling her private driver for our transfer to the airport. The bad news: Awful beds and NOISE!!!! Not street noise, but noise within the building and within the B/B itself. The room windows opened to a 6-floor atrium that was a virtual echo chamber, and we could hear every dish being washed, television show being watched, and every child\u2019s cry or dog's bark (and one dog barked constantly). There was a bathtub above our room, and we could hear every time someone got in to or out of the tub. To make matters worse, even after 10-12 hours of walking daily, I was never quite exhausted enough to sleep well in the bed. I began calling it \u201cThe Evil Bed.\u201d My friend used a sleep aid. There was simply no way to recover from the day in a bed so awful; not only was it uncomfortable, it was sized for a 12-year old. Although the proprietor indicated free WiFi, she could not name the network and was baffled when it (whatever its name) was not available. Reiterating other reviewers' comments, breakfast was a choice of sweet roll or cereal. No single-use soaps or shampoos were offered. In this day of liquid restrictions on flights, these little conveniences would have been appreciated. I've stayed in other B/B's in Italy where much more is offered for much less, to the point of feeling spoiled. I would not recommend even a brief stay at Casa Linnea in Rome.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, truly living among the Romans\u201d", "Author": "m0bius", "ReviewID": "UR82232370", "Content": "I chose this B&B based on TA reviews, and for its location. My wife & I stayed here for 4 nights, and it had it's pros & cons: Pros: This is a converted apartment, and it makes you feel like you've moved to Rome and are living with the locals. It feels more alive and integrated than staying in a traditional hotel, which I really enjoyed. The location is excellent. It is a 15 minute walk to Vatican City, 20 minutes to Piazza Navona, and only a 5 minute walk to the Metro for any other locations you may want to visit. Another plus about the location. It is just off the shopping district which means it's a middle / upper class area and feels very safe (though I've never encountered a part of Rome that I felt was dangerous). The kitchen has a coffee maker, fridge, stove, oven, and dinnerware in case you want to bring home your own food. It's not clear whether we were allowed to use the stove & oven, so ask first if you're thinking about it. Cons: As this is a converted apartment (multi-story building with courtyard), some of the neighbors across the courtyard were quite loud and didn't seem to care that their yells echo very loudly into all of the other apartments. The water pressure in the shower was dismal. The supplied breakfast is nothing more than basic twisted bread and an assortment of jellies/jams. However, there is also milk & juice in the fridge that's replenished as needed. ------ As previously stated, the rental is a converted apartment. There is a shared kitchen & dining room, then (three, I believe) bedrooms with private bathrooms. With only three rooms, it mostly feels like you have the place to yourself. Only twice did I encounter fellow renters in the B&B, and they were considerate & quiet when coming & going.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Nice Room, Dissappointed Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "jwinn", "ReviewID": "UR69697628", "Content": "Casa Linnea is located 5 minutes walk fro Castle St Angelo and 10 minutes walk from the Vatican.

Our experience was somewhat mixed. On the plus side, the owner was nice, location was excellent (near Vatican) and other fellow travellers staying there were pleasant. On the negative side, it's billed as a B&B but they don't inform you in advance that it's self catering involving preparing your own (basic) breakfast and doing wash up afterwards. Also towels are only changed twice a week - we were there for 4 days so the towels were fairly scuzzy after 2 days. We asked for a change which we got. When we arrived, we were asked for full payment in cash on day 1 which were not informed about in advance. Our room (in a 3 bedroom apartment) was very small, with fairly drab furnishing. The bed was made every day but the bathroom was not cleaned during the 4 days we were there. Having stayed in B&Bs in several countries, we expected a daily change of towels and breakfast prepared - If we'd been told upfront about these conditions in advance, we could have made an informed choice about whether to stay there or not . We paid 96 euro per night which was in our view poor value. We realise that accomodation is not cheap in Rome but one would nevertheless expect more for what we paid. The overall experience was one of having stayed not in a B&B but in an upmarket hostel. This may suit some but most probably will disappoint others as it did us.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cWell situated, cheap, clean and confortable.\u201d", "Author": "AnapDK", "ReviewID": "UR62236835", "Content": "We spent 5 nights in this bed and breakfast and were very satisfied with the place.

The communication when booking was a little difficult (over email), especially trying to pay the deposit (as they didn't accept credit cards and therefore we had to work out how to do an international transfer) but we finally were able to do it through paypal. They apparently don't usually accept late arrivals (our plane arrived at 10pm) but they made an exception. So although it was not the most pleasant of experiences over email to start with, once we got there that was all forgotten. The B&B is in an ideal location, close to a main shopping strip and in walking distance to everywhere. We were greeted by Anna and she told us everything we needed to know and then told us that she was going away for the weekend so we had the place to ourselves. As we weren't leaving until late on the day we were checking out I asked if we could arrange a late check out and she said we could have the room until whenever we needed as there was no one checking in that day. It was ideal, especially as it was so hot and to be able to come back and have a shower before going to the airport was wonderful. The room was quite large, and ours had a balcony outside. It felt like staying in someones home as I think it actually used to be an apartment which they have converted into a B&B. The owners live in the same complex but not in the B&B. Breakfast was simple and typically european - muesli, yoghurt, bread and spreads. Very nice and a good start to the day.

The owner of the B&B is very welcoming and was there to meet us upon our arrival. The B&B is in a very modern building (the doors open on their own!) on the second floor. There is an elevator but it's quite tight.. The B&B is designed in such a way that it's more of a private appartment than a B&B. Once you're all settled and have your keys, you don't see the owner (or the other guests, there are only 3 rooms and we were using 2 of them). The rooms are spacious and have 2-3 beds. Each bathroom has a different color (we had the pink/purple one) but they are very clean and have a good supply of towels. NOTE: if you are staying for a while, towels are only changed 2-3 times a week. The rooms have TVs, but there are few American channels- this shouldn't be much of a problem if you're running around Rome all day though. There are no phones, but there are hairdryers; electrical outlets and plenty of lighting. Breakfast in the hotel consists of fresh bread & pastries (the owner comes by early every morning to deliver them), jams, cereals and espresso/capuccino (there's a Nespresso machine in the kitchen). The location of the hotel is great, minutes away from the Vatican, shopping, great food and the river! This area of Rome is called \"Prati\" and it's away from most of the touristy attractions (Colosseum, Piazzas etc.) but everything is a short ride away either by car, bus, taxi or subway. TIP: if you're going to visit the Vatican museums book your tickets online and you'll save yourself a tiresome wait outside of the Vatican for at least an hour. The walk to the vatican is short (10-20 minutes) and depending through which online company you book you'll meet somewhere accross the street from the museum (we met on the steps accross from the street).
