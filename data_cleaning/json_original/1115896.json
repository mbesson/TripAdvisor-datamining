My friend and I just came back from a weekend to see a concert and we stayed here on Friday and Saturday nights. We arrived late Friday night, after 1:30am, and the staff at the front desk was very friendly despite the few French words and phrases we know. I had made a reservation a few weeks prior through their website for 1 room with 2 beds and upon opening the door to the room, I found exactly that. Comfortable and basic. It faced the back, and I thought that I would be woken up by outside noise Saturday morning because we kept the window open but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was very quiet both nights. A few downsides were that there is no elevator and our room was on the 5th (top) floor, the toilet was located a bit too close to the wall in the bathroom and the shower had no light and the curtain was not sufficient in keeping the water within the shower stall. All in all, this quintessential no-frills hotel, which is reminiscent of a European hostel, served our purpose and we felt it was a great value. I'd consider staying here again if I'm planning to return to Montreal.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cBare bones; not for light sleepers\u201d", "Author": "Catherine G", "ReviewID": "UR128015864", "Content": "Hotel is clean, conveniently located, and well-priced, with friendly staff. Had no problems with booking or check-in, although it seemed odd that we were asked to pay in full upon checking in. Perhaps a lot of guests depart early? We did - none of the people in our party could get a good night's sleep due to noise - the front rooms face a bus terminal and hear buses idling and beeping when they back up, at all hours of the night. Another room toward the back of the building shared an air duct with the room across the hall, and we could pretty much hear every word the neighbors spoke. Seems like a safe, friendly bargain hotel for young travelers who plan to stay out late anyway, but not a good choice for light sleepers.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and service!\u201d", "Author": "soujournals", "ReviewID": "UR123973399", "Content": "Great service, the ladies and gentlemen at the desk were so friendly.

The rooms are neat and clean and it is conveniently located close to the Metro, City Bus Terminal, Restaurants and shopping area. The rates were very reasonable. I really had a good time talking to the staff and getting to know them. They were very nice and friendly people and they helped me plan my tour of Montreal and Quebec and gave me advice on what to see, where to go etc. So if you are looking for a few nights to spend in montreal at a reasonable rate, with really friendly staff, this is the hotel of your choice!:D", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery Much A Budget Choice\u201d", "Author": "C0rnc0b", "ReviewID": "UR119415448", "Content": "Stayed here purely for the location, as it's right by the bus station and we needed to catch a bus out the next morning.

The bathrooms are small and quite basic; in one case, there was hardly any room to sit on the toilet without turning sideways: the seat almost touched the wall.

The neighborhood is lousy but well connected; it's across the street from the bus station and a subway station. The staff is helpful; no problems there, but you never know who you will get next door.

The staff is friendly (they happily watched my bicycle while I ran upstairs--there's no elevator, by the way--to grab something from my room, and they also happily lent me the desk phone to make free local phone calls), and the place is clean enough, but the interior, furniture, and all details are badly in need of a renovation. The shower rod and towel rod in my bathroom kept falling off, and there were water damage stains on the ceiling above my dresser. The staff told me they were planning on renovating some rooms soon. Breakfast, which is included, is barebones--white bread, butter, jam, canned orange juice, coffee, and that's about it.
