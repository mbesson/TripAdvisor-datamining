The Seastar restaurant operates a small lounge in the hotel and there is a tiny passageway enroute to the bathroom to get into the restaurant, however main entrance is also outside the hotel. Both restaurants appear to operate as separate businesses on the property. Some good points about the hotel: -good deals can be had if you search around, that include free valet parking -free wifi, newspapers and large room safe -good sized rooms with comfy beds -3 block access to the I5 making access to SEATAC easy -Whole Foods on the block is great to have for sure and has a restaurant inside (and mini places to eat as well) -one of the better ranked seafood places (Seastar) in Seattle is next to hotel, and a pizza place that is really good (and cheap) is 2 doors down -front desk and valet staff are great as others have mentioned Downsides are: -location is on the edge of downtown, not very walkable for elderly or folks with children or frankly at night, we walked without issue, but if shopping you may need to take a taxi back -the hotel does not have large public spaces you might find at other 4-5 star properties, and has a small area of the lobby as the only seating area -the fitness centre is across the retail parking area and up an elevator or flight of stairs, not convenient at all (we watched people in towels dodging vehicles to get access), we used it and while equipment was great, location was a nuisance -for some strange reason the rooms do not have tea or decaf coffee in the rooms, but pods for caffeinated coffee only -wifi works in the lobby best but was spotty on the 6th floor where we were, so we lost connections often -mini-bar prices are astronomical (thankfully Whole Foods is open until 10 pm everyday) -electrical plus somewhat inconvenient in terms of placement (behind the desk) for computer use etc., you may wish to bring an extension cord with several outlets to connect multiple devices -we stayed in 2 rooms for 3 nights and sheets not changed, only towels (no signs to advise they would not be changed or request a change etc.)", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, Excellent Food, Beautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nicole B", "ReviewID": "UR127485668", "Content": "I had a wonderful experience at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Seattle.

The hotel is a short walk from the Space Needle and monorail. A streetcar stops right in front of the hotel and goes to the Pike Place Market area.

Read lots of reviews and decided that the Pan Pacific was on our shortlist of 3. I rang to see if we could get a deal and Kayla answered the phone to me and was so helpful, friendly and informative that our decision was made and we booked the Pan Pacific without checking any other rates at any other hotel. The deal we got included Valet Parking which was invaluable as parking at the hotel is $39 a night ( in and out allowed) The valet team were fab, and when they saw us coming would run and get the car and put the heated seats on for us so we were nice and toasty! All of the staff are so warm and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble, they are very interactive and will help you with local places to eat, visit etc. The rooms are lovely, found the shutters from the bathroom to the bedroom a little unconventional but they are easily shut so no drama. We had a room overlooking the back, but some rooms overlook the space needle. The rooms are spacious and the beds comfy. The bath towels were a tad on the small side, I like big towels wrapped round me and these were a lttle small but this is such a minor thing. The addition of Whole foods was invaluable, after a long flight from the UK, we popped down there to eat ( once we worked out what to do with the boxes etc) so all was good there and was handy to get water and snacks for breakfast. The location of this hotel is perfect right by the I-5 and close to town, as the weather was so poor we used the car a lot ( paid the parking charges ouch) and took advantage of the palces that we could get too. We also went to Vancouver for the day which was fun, the border control officers thought we were lost both ways which was amusing. Take a trip to the following places Pike Market (breakfast in Lowells was lovely we went twice), Kerry Park for the views, the Seattle outlet mall, Boeing factory the list goes on but all easily reached from the hotel.

I think that it's rated four stars, but there were so many things about it that felt much more like a 5 star hotel. First of all, the rooms are really tastefully decorated. I read some reviews that said the rooms were too basic, but I disagree - the style is zen modern, and the decor made me feel instantly relaxed and calm. The bathroom was especially nice - it had a large, separate soaking tub and a glass enclosed shower. Note that I had the most basic room type. Linens and toiletries were also all top-notch. And having that Whole Foods on the ground floor could not have been more convenient. FYI: it's one of the nicest Whole Foods I've ever been to in my life, at least in terms of the prepared foods section. There are a bunch of other amenities nearby but I think that in general, the hotel is a little bit out of the main tourist area, for better or worse. You could probably walk to some of the main attractions, but it would be a long walk, recommended only for nice weather days. One small negative point (not enough to knock off a star): valet parking only (no self-park) and it's expensive! $39(?) for 24 hours in/out privileges. I think it's around the price of other hotels, but since this hotel is slightly outside the main tourist area, I still think it's a bit high.

I was able to find overnight street parking around the corner (I wanted to keep costs down since the goal was to collect miles), though there is valet parking.

All things considered, $100 even was a great price. Your mileage will vary of course. In any event, I liked everything about the hotel. It's proximity to good food and shopping; it's in a good neighborhood for walking.

Nice robs, towels and toiletries are also a nice touch. As is the free in-room wi-fi. My only caveat about the hotel, is that it is bland. All the tones in the public spaces and in the room ran from light brown to dark brown. This may be a small deal to many guests, especially since in all other respects the hotel presents so well.

This was our final stop on a long road trip from SFO to SEA. We had stayed here 2 years ago and found our second visit as enjoyable as the first. In fact, the neighborhood has evolved a bit only improving the experience. The property has a luxurious feel bordering on stuffy. I think the stuffiness comes from serving more business travelers vs. pleasure travelers. Not a criticism, just an observation as everyone is very proper, professional and somewhat robotic... not a bad thing - efficiency is good. The rooms are standard size. I booked a premium king and the room size is adequate. Honestly, I like their rooms because of the bathroom. The soaking tub is divine. Nice size shower. A proper hair dryer rather than a tiny thing attached to a wall. Comfy robes. Obviously, I like a nice bathroom and put emphasis on this part of the room. The one drawback is the sliding screen that opens the tub/bathroom to the bedroom area. Now, this is no big deal for me and my husband but if I was a traveling with someone and wanted privacy, well, you hear everything in the bathroom because of these screens. Again, no biggie for most but if you are a new couple and still not completely comfortable with each other, there isn't much privacy/sound proofing with those screens. The location of the hotel is what I would call city fringe - not the CBD but certainly close enough. You can easily walk to Pike Place Market and to other city spots. I believe the neighborhood is South Lake Union and it does not offer much in terms of restaurants and shopping but you can access other areas from the Pan Pacific + they have a complimentary car service at certain times of day to get you were you need to go. There is a Whole Foods Market and a Starbucks on the property so that helps with a quick coffee, breakfast, snacks etc as the hotel does not have coffee service in the morning (I refuse to use those in-room coffee makers). And, the Whole Foods has a grill that will cook any fish or meat for you + they offer great sides. It's an affordable way to grab a seafood dinner on the cheap but still have high quality. The gym is nice. All updated equipment and plenty of space. I used the gym twice during the stay and it was never crowded and was very clean. I love this hotel. It is comfortable, great location, pleasant staff, great amenities and I will stay here again if I travel to Seattle.

Another time, they didn't arrange the van taxi to the airport that we requested the previous night (but made up for it by driving us in their suv). The receptionist said something about the bell hops/transportation being a different company, but from a customer's perspective, it is irrelevant if they are working on the premises taking taxi reservations from hotel guests, so I didn't find her answer acceptable. It was a little frustrating... they kind of shrugged their shoulders for both incidents, leading to a pretty unpleasant guest experience.

The room itself was spacious and airy-feeling, done in muted neutral colours that brightened it even further than the gorgeous sunlight. We found the T.V. slightly on the small side (I think it was 26\"), considering that the Pan Pacific is considered to be a luxury hotel. However, the spacious accomodations and clean, luxurious bathroom made up for the smallish T.V. The hotel room came with a free appetizer or dessert voucher for the Seastar restaurant next door. We enjoyed a meal full of seafood there- try the crab & corn bisque, it is so flavourful and delicious. The proximity of the Whole Foods Market was a major highlight for our stay at the Pan Pacific, if not Seattle all together.

Relatively new, in an area that is seeing considerable redevelopment off the main drag of downtown Seattle. The hotel itself is an oasis \u2013 the architectural and styling lines ooze creature comfort. Check in is flawless, with no limit on the amount of information conveyed in a helpful, welcoming way. Even booking through Expedia, at a reduced advance rate, we were given a 10th floor Lake view room. The room boasts almost floor to ceiling windows from post to post. The amount of natural light is stunning, even on two gloomy days in Seattle. The bathroom is set off by sliding doors, which when opened convey and reinforce a sense of roominess. The natural wood and compatible fixtures are handsomely elegant, again, just right for the space. The bed and working areas are top notch.

We found it to be a clean and friendly hotel with wide, quiet halls and an iconic view through tall windows. Location The hotel is located in an interesting complex with a Starbuck\u2019s, cards/gifts shop, and a pet store. There's a nice public park, Denny Park, kitty-corner, that is great for walking, and it ensures that no buildings will block the view of the Space Needle. Best of all, downstairs (accessible by lift and escalator) is a giant Whole Foods Market. The Whole Foods Market provides all kinds of breakfast lunch and dinner foods and tables. If you select a steak, they\u2019ll cook it for you, and you can sit down and eat it. The most interesting shops would be along Westlake Street. We walked to Pike's Place, stopping at Serious Pie on Virginia Street near 4th Avenue for a Yukon potato pizza. We had taken the Gourmet Seattle tour, and we were not impressed with any of the \"gourmet\" dishes except the potato pizza. Restaurant We were happy to find that Seastar restaurant is accessible through the hotel. It has excellent food. The hotel provides a coupon for a free soup or salad. We especially enjoyed the crab and corn bisque and halibut with artichokes and mushrooms. There is also a pizza restaurant, Tutta Bella, next to the Seastar. Room Or room was quite large with a view of the Space Needle from the desk, the bed, and the bathroom sink. A coffee maker and a hair dryer are in the closet, but in order to be used, they have to be moved to a location where there is an electric plug. The refrigerator was cold but there was no freezer. There are both a phone and a temperature control in the bathroom. We received a free newspaper every day. Quiet enjoyment The fourth floor may be a bit low for light sleepers because trucks go up a grade on the Denny Way side of the room. The windows are double windows and we had no problem with the traffic noise. No neighbor noise, not even footsteps overhead. Internet Everyone gets free Internet. A huge plus. We used only wireless because the signal was good and strong and we couldn't find a LAN cable in the desk. Concierge The doormen are special here. The concierge personnel open the door and engage guests in conversation which makes them seem especially friendly and helpful. The concierge, I think it was Mike, gave us a lift in the hotel car to the Space Needle (uphill) and we walked back to the hotel (downhill). We ate lunch at SkyCity and found the food and service to be a good value and not overpriced.

While the room wasn't huge, every facet of the room was clearly designed to enhance a sense of comfort -- both physical comfort and comfort with one's surroundings. I was particularly pleased with the bathroom, which had both a standing, glass-enclosed shower and a separate, deep bathtub. Even better was the decision to have a window through from the bedroom to the bathroom (with shutters for those of you who prefer complete privacy), allowing natural light from the large main windows in and allowing me to leave the bathroom lights off. I appreciated this both for being able to save the electricity and for ambiance, as my visit coincided with a rare sunny day in Seattle in February, and the natural light filtering in really was more than adequate. It also helped the comparatively small room feel larger to have the bathroom more \"integrated\" with the space.

The driver will try to charge you the full rate instead, claiming that the Pan Pacific is located at the edge of the hotel district and therefore does not necessarily qualify.

We found the parking garage easily enough, but were shocked that it was $35, (yes, $35, that's not a typo) to park for 24 hours! Holy cow!...Oh well, it IS Seattle! We sucked it up and paid. Check in was extremely simple and friendly and we had to sign a waiver for our two yellow labs that we brought with us at a charge of $50 for the night. We were aware of this in advance and had no problem with it. Loved how you have to have a room keycard to activate the elevator. Awesome security feature, although this part of town doesn't feel at all unsafe. We got to our room on the third floor and were pleasantly shocked to find that they had given us an amazing room with a full on view of the Space Needle all lit up at night. Simply gorgeous. (Room #309) The room itself couldn't have been cleaner. Very modern, tasteful furnishings, and very nice comfortable beds and linens. Their down comforters were great. The bathroom literally sparkled. It was HUGE, had a cool eco-friendly water saving toilet, and very high quality, good smelling shampoo/conditioner/lotion kit. I even used the tub for a long hot soak, while watching TV (a very nice good sized newer either LCD or plasma) with the Shoji screens that separate the bedroom area from the bath wide open. Kinda cool. Further on the bath-The tub is humongous/very deep and super clean (I am not usually one to use the tub at a hotel, but...I couldn't resist) The shower was also enormous and spotless, very roomy. Light bathrobes are provided which is always nice. There was a safe, iron/ironing board etc too. Since it is a pet-friendly hotel, there were of course, large raised stainless steel doggy bowls complete with special doggy treats from the boutique doggy shop across the plaza. Nice touch to us dog lovers! Although it is very expensive, we loved having the ability to walk downstairs to pick up late night snacks at the Whole Foods Market. We only stayed for the one night, so we didn't get the chance to walk around and shop, although GREAT shopping is just blocks from this location.

First, we were surprised that a three-year-old, luxury hotel would have frayed carpet, chipped dressers and rather cheap lounge chairs. We did enjoy the bathroom but even here found the performance of the hot water and air conditioning to be erratic.

They have a separate bath and shower so you have a lot of room to move about and set your clothes and not have to think about being so cramped and lots of steam and sweating at the same time! Our room was so clean, we forgot to bring our bedroom slippers but I had no issues with walking barefoot on their carpet and tile at all.

I asked for a nice view and I was not disappointed, with the Space Needle to a hard left, and a direct line of sight of Lake Union - perfect as my stay coincided with the Independence Day fireworks. The large desk had a really comfortable chair. There was plenty of room to walk about and a good-sized wardrobe. Oodles of space. The bathroom was absolutely huge, with a full-sized separate shower and bathtub. The most unique feature of this bathroom is that it opened out in to the room. Only a sliding door and panel seal the bathroom off from the rest of the room. Not a problem for me, a solo traveller, but if you were staying with someone and you value your privacy, it's not really concealed at all. I was amazed to find that the housekeeper had bundled and neatly tied my messy cables on the desk. I thought it was a really nice touch and showed thoroughness in the service. I can't really think of many drawbacks. I booked through Expedia, which had a much cheaper rate than the hotel's own website. While they would match a price, it would only be after you made a reservation directly through them.

I found the staff to be extremely welcoming and helpful during my stay. The hotel decor is awesome. Having said that, I was surprised to see just how many odd things there were in terms of features and functionality in such a hotel. I arrived in the room and unpacked and wanted to iron my clothes. I looked through the entire room and couldn't find it. The service guide for the hotel tells guests to touch \"Service Now\" for all needs. Alas, there is no \"Service Now\" button. So I dialed 0 and explained the situation. A housekeeper then came by with an iron and ironing board. I then walked into the bathroom and found the coffee service sitting on the ledge above the bathtub. Why would they place the coffee maker at the foot of the bathtub. Sure looks nice but it's not functional. Later that evening, I wanted to plug in my laptop and cell phone to recharge them and was looking for an outlet by the desk. I found it after crawling on the floor behind two layers of drapes. A small point, the bottle of conditioner in the shower had a small foil seal under the cap. There was no tab or any way to lift it up or puncture it. Not very functional. The reason I am mentioning these things is that it is one thing to have a hotel that looks nice. It's another thing have a hotel that functions well for a business traveler. I am partial to other national brands for this reason. Hotel rooms should have irons as a matter of course. Desks should have electrical outlets. All of this stuff is straightforward. I sent the hotel a message about these things via the hotel web site and received a voice mail apologizing for the problems and a gift certificate for one night's stay. That was a nice gesture.

There is a Starbuck's adjacent to the lobby and a Whole Foods market next to the hotel. The hotel is also part of a condo complex. Overall, the hotel is very nice aesthetically.

Throughout the stay, the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations and directions. The first night we ate at the restaurant next to the hotel, Sea Star.

You never have to go to the garage ever cause they get it for you and put it away as well no matter how many times you come and go. Starbucks, and all the other shops plus Whole Foods is so convenient!!! When other shops come to the nearby area you won't have to leave there for much. My grown daughter and teenager want to live at the PanPacific! Housekeeping found our wallet and it was mailed back to us at home with everything intact. They have umbrella's for Seattle's raindrops. I am sure that no matter what the request the Pan Pacific staff would do everything within their means to see that you are accomodated. Our coffee maker quit working and they delivered one within minutes late at night. We thought the light bulbs had burnt out so within minutes staff was at the door to help turn on the lights (we didn't know how to flip the switch).

We chose to stay in Seattle because we love the sightseeing and shopping in Seattle. My wife did a lot of research before choosing the Pan Pacific Seattle Hotel. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was the location and the nearby Whole Foods market. We figured that it would be very nice to pop into whole foods at will and get food, etc. We had requested early check-in, but when we arrive they told us that it would be over one hour before we could check into to room. We were disappointed because after the plane trip we were tired and ready to get in and freshen up. We reluctantly left our luggage and went to Whole Foods to get a bite of lunch. Within 30 minutes they called us and told us the room was ready and they upgraded our room as well! The room was quite nice, very clean and well designed with a beautiful corner with windows along both walls. It had a nice view and was quite comfortable. The bathroom had a garden tub and had a set of sliding doors that could be opened and allowed a view to the huge windows if one desired to enjoy the skyline while soaking in a hot bath! The bed has to be one of the most comfortable beds that I've ever slept on. I hated to go back home to my new high end mattress. It's just not in the same league :( The staff was quite courteous and helpful. From the small detail of opening the door for you to helpful and good advise for dining and even a courtesy limo to take you around the area. The lobby was very stylish and elegant and they even had access to a spa across the courtyard with 24 hour access to the fitness facility. The location is great! It's in the corner of Westlake and Denny way. We walked to the Pike Place Market and North a little farther than Harrison St. Very easy to get around and c lose enough to walk to many shopping, dining and tourist spots in downtown Seattle. We were very pleased with the Pan Pacific Hotel and it's friendly and capable staff. We would definitely return there. BTW, a short walk away at the corner of Harrison and Terry, you'll find one of the best brunch/breakfast places in the country. The Portage Bay restaurant is awesome!

Examples: the water pressure was intentionally low (they listed it as a \"feature\"); the hot water was intermittent and never truly hot (we tried different times to make sure it wasn't just shower rush hour); the air conditioner could not be set lower than 65. Besides the conservationist failure, there was also an overall sense of nickel and diming you to death. You had to pay for parking - which by itself we can understand, it's downtown Seattle - but you also had to pay for silly things like the plastic laundry bag ($14!!). On top of these issues was the sense that not much thought went into the actual rooms. Examples: the insulation was so thin we could hear other people's wakeup phone calls; the bathtub was placed so the person could watch tv, which would be a win except the drain was inconveniently placed directly where the person would sit; the light on the smoke detector was bright enough to light up the room - in fact the resident before us had actually wrapped up the detector with a washcloth to mute the light... and it was still overly bright! One last note: the rooms were designed with a sliding partition window between the bathroom (by the bathtub) and the rest of the hotel room. Initially this seems neat as you can watch tv or enjoy the view from the bathroom. However, this room design becomes extremely inconvenient as soon as one person is asleep - going to the bathroom or using the shower/tub are too noisy as the partition barely muffles any sounds.

There were some small stains in the carpet here and there, black smudges on the cabinets, and the loveseat was the most uncomfortable piece of furniture I've encountered in a hotel! The cushion squishes down, leaving your legs hanging over the hard frame in the front. Another disappointment was the minibar policy - even in the Executive Suite there is only an area for about 4 pop cans left for personal use. The rest is electronically monitored, so that if you move one of their bottles, you pay! A note said they will remove all the drinks on request - for a fee of $35! Ridiculous. And finally, the fitness center is located in a separate building across a small courtyard. It's not far at all, but it would be a lot more convenient right inside the hotel.

Yes, it's as fabulous as everyone says. We were enthusiastically greeted every time we entered and left. Check in and out were seamless. Dinner at the Seastar restaurant was outstanding. Then there's the room. . . Room 714 faces northeast and was a very comfortable size for two people. (We could see the Space Needle if we pressed our faces to the glass and looked left.) The abundance of toiletries was a nice touch - loofah mitt, large tubes of shampoo & conditioner, bath salts for that big tub, etc. Free in-room WiFi is a BIG plus - we hate it when hotels nickel-and-dime you for internet access. We streamed music from on line, though the room is tricked out with every entertainment gadget you could want. LOCATION: Definitely not in the middle of the tourist attractions, but we liked that. A 3/4-mile walk down Lenora will put you directly on an overpass staircase/elevator that leads directly to the waterfront/Alaskan Way tourist attractions. The hotel entrance doesn't face the street and accessing the internal courtyard can be a little tricky the first time. (Enter on Terry Avenue.) 30-minute parking is allowed in the plaza for unloading. We didn't want to pay the steep valet parking fee so we saved $7/day by parking at the Pacific Place mall garage and walking back to the hotel. We used our car for dinner at Canlis on Saturday night and were able to find free on-street parking right outside the hotel when we returned. (Street parking is free after 6pm Saturday and all day Sunday - why pay for a garage?) The hotel is adjacent to the residential tower and the plaza has lots of amenities - Whole Foods, the obligatory Starbucks, dry cleaner, FedEx/Kinkos, card shop, pet store and a few nice restaurants. It felt like home away from home (rather than a tourist mecca). And Jazz Alley, Cinerama and Top Pot Doughnuts are a short walk down Lenora. I didn't use the fitness center (which was probably equally amazing) because we had awesome weather. I ran every day along the waterfront - straight down Lenora to Elliott Bay and north into Elliott Bay Park. There's a time-release water fountain about 1/2 mile in and another at the Fisherman's Pier along with public restrooms. Continue on the paved path past the grain terminal, along the cruise ship pier, follow the train tracks, around the school bus parking lot, and end in cute Smith Cove Park on the water (another time-release water fountain), which is a little over 4.5 miles from the hotel. If you head south, the rest rooms at the Seattle Ferry Terminal may come in handy. ;) HIGHLY RECOMMEND: If you've money to burn, have a phenomenal dinner at Canlis. Not to be believed. We saw the Dave Brubeck quartet at Jazz Alley, a really nice club. Don't miss the Seattle Public Library - it ain't your grandmother's library, funded by Microsoft and a technological wonder. You could easily spend an hour starting on the 10th floor & wandering down to the cafe. Bring your camera. Take a sightseeing boat tour if the weather is nice - it's the best way to see the city from a new perspective (and boat rides are just so darn romantic).", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201c5 Star !\u201d", "Author": "woodsmokeillinois", "ReviewID": "UR41961506", "Content": "Wonderful, comfortable rooms and very quiet.

But the fact isn't the market itself, but its the deli, the cafe, and basically your own DIY restaurant.

After looking online for the best rates, I called the hotel directly who gave me the same rates I would have had through Expedia, a deal at $235 for two, spacious, Executive King rooms, (814 and 914) with all the bells and whistles. The beds were the most comfortable I've slept on in any hotel. The teenagers who drew the short straws for the pull-out couches said they were good, too. The bathrooms were first-class with separate shower and large soaker tub. I was impressed to see that the coffee supplied in the room was the same rather expensive brand we use at home. My husband and I used the gym facilities which had top-notch equipment. The rooms, lobby and hallways were spotlessly clean. It was the best chain hotel I've stayed at where you get the local feel of the city: the hallways were decorated with historical photos of old Seattle, the Space Needle featured prominently in the view (the hotel is situated to maximize the views for as many rooms as possible), the modernist glass architecture in the hotel and surrounding neighbourhood was typical Seattle, reflecting the subtle Pacific Northwest skies. The view from the courtyard looking towards the Needle is very fine. While we never ate at the hotel restaurant, the large Whole Foods store at the street level was ideal for breakfast and a fast snack. How much more Seattle can you get than drinking fresh, organic carrot juice? The upscale pizza restaurant next door was delicious. The service was attentive and genuinely friendly. The restaurant recommendations were excellent. The hotel surprised us with complimentary appetizers while we were seated at a near-by Italian restaurant. And now to location, which the previous reviewer didn't like. It's just east of the Space Needle and slightly north of downtown, about a 10-minute walk to Nordstrom's. When our bags were too full from a day of shopping the taxi fare back to the hotel was less than 5 bucks, but otherwise we walked. If one were staying in a larger city, such as New York, one wouldn't even notice such a triviality. The hotel felt as if it were in a real cool urban neighbourhood, where people actually lived, but with the benefit of being right next to the downtown core. (Silly, I know, but I could imagine Frasier neurotically pacing behind one of the penthouse windows in the surrounding condos.) We went to several local restaurants, where real Seattle people eat, which were fabulous. And so, unless you have serious mobility issues, don't let the location deter you. And even then, take a cab. The best of all was the service. I'd stupidly left my expensive telephoto lens and camera bag in my room after check-out, which I'd tucked in the night table stand. The hotel kindly shipped it to my home right away. While you're in Seattle, here's a must-see. Be sure to check out the Experience Music Project (EMP), rent the iPods and listen to the guitars in the guitar gallery.

This hotel deserves all the positive reviews it gets and although some kinks may need to be worked out the staff will always be there to take care of anything you need. We were fortunate enough to stay at this great hotel on two occasions during our trip to the Pacific Northwest. The General Manager, David Sullivan, as well as Paul, who will be the first to welcome you, and Angela at the front desk made our trip the most memorable yet. This hotel should be the top on everyone's list when you come to Seattle. First of all, the rooms on both occasions were great. Our first room was Deluxe Double facing the Needle. My two kids refused to close the curtains at night as they fell asleep with a Seattle landmark gleaming in the distance. The bathroom was also great with a nice tub that had doors above that opened up to allow you to bathe and look outside at the great view. My son and daughter took a bath every night during our stay forcing us to go to Lush at Westgate Center to by bubble bath. It was a neat feature to have that I'm sure other hotels in Seattle could not offer. On our second stay in Executive room on view was of Lake Union which was equally beautiful. The bathroom was even bigger, if possible, with a shower you could invite all your friends to. (If you are in to that!) Anyway, both rooms were spectacular. Having a Whole Foods along with two great restaurants, Seastar and Tutto Bella, come in handy after a long day of sightseeing. Also a nice feature at the hotel was the access to the free internet right near the front desk. All these things add up on along vacation and the fact we could get a good affordable meal or save on internet services helped out. These are things the big chains nickel and dime you on. Having stayed at this Pan Pacific and the Pan Pacific Village Centre in Whistler I felt we got more than our monies worth. Finally, As most reviews stated it is a couple of blocks from Westlake Center and shopping, the Space Needle, or a little bit longer to Pike Place Market but what better way to enjoy this beautiful city than to walk it. Public transportation is located steps from the hotel, the hotel has a car service, and taxis await in the parking lot for those who do not wish to take it all in. This should not be a reason to not to stay at this perfect getaway spot. We did it with two kids in the middle of a heat wave. In a very green city everyone should go out there and just walk it, unless it is raining which then the Pan Pacific will gladly give you an umbrella.

The hotel was located in a convenient location - you can easily walk to Pike's or the Space Needle within 10 to 15 minutes from the hotel. It is also convenient to any of the downtown area and you walk through some of it on the way down to the Market. The hotel is also situated with a few businesses adjacent to the property which is convenient if you need food, drink, etc. The best is the Whole Foods Market which the hotel sits on top of - I am still going through withdrawals not having one near me in Florida. There is also a Bank of America, Starbucks, drug store, mail/packaging shop all within one minute of the lobby doors. I upgraded the room to the Space Needle KIng room. The room was on a low floor but still had fantastic views of the Needle. There is apparently only one of these rooms per floor - each one on the corner of the building facing the Needle. This gives you an entire side of the room (including bathroom areas) that face the Space Needle. While a higher room would have been nice, the view was still great. Our friends did not have the upgrade and while they could \"see\" the Needle, it was only by looking out sharply to the left. We, on the other hand, could lay in bed looking out towards it - there was no place in the room you could not see it unless it was foggy. The hotel was immaculately clean - probably one of the best kept properties I've been to including some Ritz's, etc. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Negatives? Yes, a few but they were minor. First, the TV programming is difficult to use and figure out. And checking out online from room proved to be frustrating and impossible. I also had just left the front desk where I made arrangements for a taxi to take us to the cruise terminal and when I got up to the room to checkout, the door keys were deactivated. I went back down, got the keys reactivated and went up to get the bags and checkout. That's when I had the issue with the online checkout. So, upon visiting the desk the third time in a half hour (the same person), he looked at me like he did not recognize me at all. So that was a little odd - but the hotel did allow me to check out a bit later so I was able to overlook this as a minor problem. Would I stay there again?

We've stayed in hotel bedrooms that were smaller than this bathroom. Robes and slippers were provided as is bottled water each evening and the coffee maker was well-used. We appreciated the balcony and were content to watch the evening skies in a period of wonderful weather with our coffees. The proximity of a Whole Foods market below the hotel was a real bonus and we loved it - for breakfast, some dinners and fruit, sodas etc to take away. The availability of a free PC/internet/printer was useful for keeping in touch with family and for on-line flight check-in. Special attention is clearly paid to staff training and their professionalism was outstanding. Some hotel staff can be \"stuffy\" when polite but the Pan Pacific staff seem to have got it just right - warm, friendly, relaxed and helpful. They should be a model for hotel staff everywhere and deserve special mention for the warm welcome, every day. Other reviewers have commented on the fact that the hotel is on the edge of downtown but we found it easily walkable- to downtown, Lake Union and the Space Needle- all within walking distance though buses and trolleys are right outside if you don't walk! We \"discovered\" transit terminals latterly close by and free buses take you quickly to most downtown areas such as ferry terminals, Chinatown etc - quicker than the surface buses due to the tunnel. We took a floatplane trip to the San Juan Islands and ferries to Bainbridge and Bremerton, all thoroughly recommended. Seattle is a great city and the Pan Pacific helped to make it a really special trip for us. Would not hesitate to return there and recommend it highly.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, clean, excellent service\u201d", "Author": "wanderlustfultexan", "ReviewID": "UR34482098", "Content": "Seattle Pan Pacific is one of the nicest places I've stayed.

This time, I had more of an opportunity to explore the hotel and environs, and this is really a good choice in Seattle. First, the hotel rooms are cleverly designed, quite comfortable, with beautiful and pristine bathrooms. I had a corner suite looking toward the Space Needle, and the view was great. Last time I only saw the street and an old building, so this view was much better (and I actually paid less this time and was upgraded). The bed is incredibly comfortable, although the room would have benefitted from a good easy chair. The desk chair was very good, but the other chair was more decorative than inviting. The gym is awesome! If you like to work out, you won't want to leave the gym. It's not huge, but larger than most hotel gyms and the equipment is state-of-the-art. I felt like I got as good a workout as I do at home, and you can't get that at most hotel gyms (and it's free!). It, too, was spotless and open 24-7. It's about a 7-10 minute walk to the central city/Pike Place Market, but not bad and safe. There is also a tram if you don't mind paying $1.75 to ride a few blocks. Right at the hotel is a terrific Whole Foods and Starbucks can be accessed from the lobby (it's a real Starbucks, not the hotel kind). If you want to get out of town for the day, there is an Enterprise Car Rental office just a block from the hotel. My only complaints about the room were that the sink doesn't drain (happened on both visits - it's a design flaw) and at night all the tv/dvr/dvd equipment and fridge make noise and there are some lights that kind of blink on and off. Also, the clock by the bed is a retro tick-tock clock, not a digital clock like you usually see in hotels. It was cute but a little loud - I stashed it in the closet.

We've heard good things about the hotel, so when we got a $110/night rate through Travelzoo, we thought we'd give it a shot. We easily found street parking and walked a couple of blocks to the hotel. The lobby was very pretty, both the general design and the Christmas decorations. Check-in was very easy. The person at the check-in desk was helpful, making sure we had parking, seeing if we needed to make any dinner reservations, and asking if we'd like a morning paper. Our room was located on the 7th floor, which is about halfway up in the building. We had a view of Lake Union, which wasn't anything spectacular, but pretty nice. The weather in Seattle in December is a little too gloomy to do much gazing out the window anyway. We had a deluxe room, with a queen bed,which is the lowest on the totem pole for this hotel. The room was a good size with a desk, chaise lounge, bed and dresser. The TV was a large one, with many stations to watch. The bathroom is huge with gorgeous marble counters, a beautiful tiled shower and the most amazing soaking tub. The toiletries in the room were nice, and even included bath gel, which I put to good use in the big tub. As others have mentioned, the bathroom is open to the bedroom, but has sliding covers for the large window opening between the two rooms. This makes the room seem even larger, which is nice, but it also means that the bathroom is very unsoundproof, which is not my favorite thing on a romantic weekend getaway. The room also had a coffee pot and coffee, which is always nice. The mini-bar fridge has a small space that's for personal use, which I thought was a good touch.

I LOVED this place and I've traveled all over the world. The most pleasant thing about the PanPacific is the design - it is sleek, Asian-inspired, elegant and it is only 2 years old so it has the feeling of being new. The place just oozed relaxation and comfort. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, not pretentious at all. Many of the other guests were international travelers, many from Asia, some from Africa. The room was wonderful - I can't say enough about the great design. The bed was heavenly. The flat screen TV was amazing. Wifi worked great with no problem at all. There was a Japanese-like screen that separated the bathroom from the bedroom that could be opened up, giving the room a much more spacious feel than most hotel rooms. The room could have been bigger in size, but it is an urban hotel and thus one can't expect lots of space with a regular, non-suite room. The tub and shower in the bathrooms were fabulous. Endless amounts of hot water, great water pressure. The room included a safe and a mini-bar. We also had a nice sized desk and a chaise lounge. The room service food was delicious! We had 3 breakfasts and a dinner through room service. (We got a room deal that included room service breakfast for $20/adult/day.) Some of the best food we ate in Seattle was room service at this hotel! But the piece de resistance was the Vida Spa. I love spas and I usually get a massage wherever I travel, plus regular visits to the spa at home. The Vida was divine! I have truly never been to a spa like this before. The room that you wait for your masseuse in is dark, quiet, and so dramatic- there is a long rectangular window with a line of flames flaring upwards. All the chairs seat facing the fire. And the white leather chair I sat upon was one of the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in. I relaxed so much before I even saw my masseuse! The massage I had was outstanding! For the life of me I can't remember her name but she was quite young, petite, with shoulder-length dark hair, slender. The lady at the front desk accomodated a last minute request to change the time of my massage. My visit to this spa really added so much to the overall stay at the Pan Pacific that I would *highly recommend* going, even if you are not the type that usually goes to the spa. Trust me - this is not to be missed. My husband and I had our 3 year old son with us. The hotel is not the kind of place one would normally take a young child as it doesn't cater to kids. But the staff were extremely friendly and sweet towards him. Also, our son loved the hotel because he loves elevators and escalators. There are two public outdoor escalators in the plaza just outside the hotel. Also in the plaza is a Starbucks coffee, Whole Foods, an upscale pet store, a tobacco/cigar store, and more. There was so much to see and do in Seattle that we will definitely come back and will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific. Even though it is a little further away from downtown than many of the other hotels, it is definitely worth the extra walk or short cab ride. This hotel has set a new standard for me for hotels in this price range. I absolutely loved it. My husband, who is thrifty and cost-conscious, was initially uncertain about staying here but did it because I was so eager about it. Even he enjoyed himself and is willing to go back and spend the extra money for all the amenities and overall luxury experience. If I was Howard Hughs and looking to spend the rest of my days in a hotel room, this would *definitely* be the place that I would stay!!!!

On both I was disappointed, and I don't consider myself too picky about hotels. The hotel is extremely hard to find. To find the hotel, it would have been helpful to know that I should drive into the Westlake condo complex rather than look for a hotel entrance. Don't rely on GoogleMaps, it has the hotel in the wrong place. The parking ($28/day plus tips for valet) seemed expensive. There is self-parking next to the Whole Foods right on Westlake Ave., but the front desk told me valet parking was actually more reasonable for guests. The hotel is outside of actual downtown, about a 15-20 minute walk to Nordstrom/Macy's in a classy multi-use condo complex with a Whole Foods right below it (great for snacks). This area appears to be transforming into a new upscale high-rise residential area, but there is little visitor activity in this vicinity. There is a LOT of construction going on, with one high rise right across the street going up. Perhaps all the construction is reflected in the daily rate of the hotel, but the thick glass keeps out most of the noise. A lot of other Seattle hotels are much closer if you will be going to the Farmer's Market or shopping as a tourist. That said, there is a GREAT Italian restaurant recommended by the hotel about 2 blocks away called Barolo. Absolutely outstanding food and service, and the best food we had in Seattle during our stay. Our modern room was enormous and a gorgeous Japanese-onsen (spa) inspired bathroom. Windows in the bathroom were huge, but of clear glass (even in the toilet room!) so we kept the blinds tilted or closed for privacy. Separate shower and bathtub. Shoji-inspired doors slide open if you want to make the bathroom part of the bedroom. Beds were decent, but not of Westin or Four Seasons caliber. There were a LOT of b-i-g stains and dirt on the carpeting, something I would not expect of a luxury hotel. Because there are two handles placed right next to each other on the very edge of the wardrobe closet doors, I smashed my fingers in the handles daily. Strangely, there was only one upholstered chair in our room, so one person always had to sit on the bed. Service at the front desk and valet was caring, prompt and courteous. The dramatic, clean-lined modern lobby is of the latest urban design using a lot of zebra wood paneling. The hotel serves breakfast in the AM for its guests in the bar. Price for a luxury hotel is not unreasonable, about $15 for an egg omelette, coffee extra. This Whole Foods also serves breakfast: you order at cashier and they bring the food to you.

If you love modern, contemporary design and architecture, Asian flair, unique room layout, then you may well love this hotel. However, if you value function over form, you may be very disappointed. If you want to call \"Service One\" (i.e., the concierge button) for a bucket of ice, and don't mind waiting 15 to 30 minutes for your ice, this is your place. If you would rather walk down the hall and have the bucket of ice in 2 or 3 minutes, you will be disappointed. If you want to walk out and get into your car and drive away, stay elsewhere. If you don't mind $28 per night for parking, plus a valet tip, plus 10 to 30 minute wait to get your car, this place will be fine. The room is about the same size as any major-chain hotel, but the layout is quite different. The bathroom is much larger, with a separate tub and really nice shower. The toilet is unique: \"half flush\" and \"full flush\" buttons (made by Caroma in Australia, http://www.caroma.com.au/index.html). The shower head is a great Kohler unit that supplies a soft, wide, drench. The bathroom is separated from the bedroom by sliding \"screens\": open is nearly useless, as the toilet is visible from the bed. Closed is ok, but the bathroom is not really separate from the bedroom, but more like a toilet with a bed sheet for privacy. This form/function conflict appears numerous places: a wonderful, round, retro clock that goes tick-tock, but uses \"glow-in-the-dark\" hands that, about 10 minutes after the lights go out, cannot be read. Wake up in the middle of the night and you cannot tell what time it is. The bedroom has a contemporary work desk, ergonomic chair (entirely out-of-place with its all-plastic construction), tiny round end table, and \"chaise\" sofa suitable for one person. We had room service dinner one night, and there was no place to simply sit and eat. Tray on the desk, service on the chaise/chair/bed. Very uncomfortable. Oh, and they forgot to give us any type of table napkins with dinner -- we could have called down again, but used face clothes from the bathroom rather than wait for them to bring napkins while our food got cold. Finally, the \"service one\" button on the phone gets prompt answering, but very erratic response. I was here with several acquaintances in other rooms, and we all had ice buckets take from 10 minutes to 1 hour, car valet service from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, etc. Summary: if you value form over function, you may love this place.

A real plus is that there is a Starbucks connected to the hotel and Whole Foods is right around the corner. The downside is there is a charge for everything. Parking was $30/ valet for $28, no continental breakfast, pay for local calls, and so on. The room service was also not good at all for the quality of the hotel. My steak was overdone, the potatoes looked and tasted like they had come out a box and put in a microwave, no crab in the crab omelet.... Stay here but eat at Whole Foods or another restaurant downtown.", "Date": "February 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver BC", "Title": "\u201cFather/Son 2-nighter\u201d", "Author": "ianpeean", "ReviewID": "UR13659142", "Content": "We arrived in the dark around dinnertime in the pouring rain. Of course we are used to this coming from the OTHER rainiest city in North America, Vancouver. My son and I were on a \"boy's bonding\" trip so I booked a room with 2 queen beds. Overall I was very impressed. The staff was VERY good. The room was very tastefully decorated and the flatscreen LCD TV syatem was cool (although not quite as hip as the Hotel 1000). The room had a fantastic view of the Space Needle which was fun for my son. I really hav no complaints save for the water pressure in the shower was a little anemic. Which is strange considering some of the other reviews mentioned that their water pressure was too much - go figger. Anyway, if you cn book this for under $200 it is a STEAL. Even above that price the Pan Pacific is a quality place. We got a very preferable rate, (let's just say it was under $150 per night) and I would highly recommend it. One word of caution though, If you are the type that likes to sleep in be aware there is a big construction project going on next door that starts banging before 8AM. Oh, and a parking tip. If you arrive after 6 PM and leave before 9AM (technically the clock starts at 8, but I'm a gambler) you can park for free on the street beside the Bank Of America. The Pan Pacific followed up with a customer satisfaction survey and when I had one or two slight negatives on the multiple choice, they apologized personally via email.

The bed, linens and pillows were luxurious and provided an excellent nights rest. The soaking tub was great and the amenities were very acceptable. Outside noise was almost zero except for the emergency vehicles when they operated sirens to get through traffic. The shower stall does need some help. As mentioned in previous reviews, the floor will become wet due to the inability to adjust the shower head away from the door causing water to run down the door and drain to the exterior of the shower stall. The bath floor mat captured most of the water but beware when walking around in your socks! Breakfast room service was tasty although a tad overpriced for the quantity and quality.

Location & Convenience: Although a bit out of the main downtown area, it is an easy walk or a cab ride to downtown shopping, museums and pike place market. You can take the new trolley for free that stops right outside the hotel and it takes you to downtown shopping areas so this was very convenient. Also, as others have mentioned, Whole Foods Market is just beneath the hotel as well as Starbucks, which is actually connected to the hotel through a side door. I'd rate 4 out of 5 for location and 5 stars for convenience. Room: We had the king room which had simplistic modern design with very good bathroom layout. There was Asian style sliding doors that would open up the sunken bathtub to your bed which made the room feel much bigger than what it actually was. Bed was very comfortable with very good pillows too (possibly on par with Campton Place in San Francisco) . Bed and bath are always a high priority on our vacation and Pan Pacific Seattle delivered. The only complaint I would have is the bath amenities, although plentiful, should be of better quality. 4.5 stars. Service: I have to give 5 stars on this as everyone was eager to help and it showed. Although a tad inexperienced as would be expected for a new hotel, service as a whole was very good. Personally, we hate the gigantic hotel chains as the service can slake off but this one was well proportioned with just enough rooms to accommodate their guests needs. Room service food was above par but selection wasn't abundant. Quality wise, I'd rank 4 stars. Extra tips: Since the hotel is fairly new, our cab driver from the airport did not know where it was located, even his GPS navigator did not pick it up. We were lucky that I had remembered the address... also, it took about 30 minutes for the taxi to arrive in the early morning of our departure. If you're taking a cab from the airport to the hotel or vice versa, take the Orange cab since they have a flat rate. Otherwise, it'll cost about $35~$40 (including tip).", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cFive star hotel at four star price\u201d", "Author": "Echo888", "ReviewID": "UR12296366", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Pan Pacific and was very impressed at the five star quality of the hotel.
