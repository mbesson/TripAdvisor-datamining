From the moment we walked in the door after being picked up at the airport by a hotel representative, we were treated like royalty by the very sweet and professional hotel staff. A guest relations concierge, Zeynep, welcomed us and presented us with Turkish coffee and fresh juices as she sat with us and outlined city highlights and helpful tips on getting around the city before presenting us with our own map and train schedule. Our room was spacious, immaculate, modern, and comfortable...we opted for the Superior room and had a wonderful verandah with a great view of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorus. The hotel offers complimentary wine on the upstairs terrace from 19:00-19:30, where guests can gather to watch the sunset. The food was incredible...breakfast is a feast of meats, breads, eggs, yogurts, fruit, honeycomb, juices, and coffee, and always included a selection of local dishes, as well. Afternoon mezzes are available from 1300-1900, and were also impressive. We happened to be in town for my birthday, and the lovely staff brought a cake to my room and presented me with a lovely turkish coffee set as a gift...I was so surprised and moved by the personal touches and attention to detail. We have both stayed in tons of luxury hotels all over the world, and upon leaving, we agreed that Neorion takes the prize as the best customer service we've ever experienced. The hotel itself is also charming and comfortable, with great city views. We especially liked our bathroom...great lighting, spacious shower, and again, the whole place was spotless...we could've eaten off the floors. We're so glad we chose this hotel, and will definitely be back.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camberley", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "John D", "ReviewID": "UR128533911", "Content": "The Neorion is a very pleasant hotel in a great location for sight-seeing.

We stayed there in two rooms, 306(double room) and 303(twin room) for four nights, from 17th to 21st of April. I am absolutely sure I will stay there again the next time I visit Istanbul. It is very conveniently located next to Sirkeci tram station (which gives you access to Taxim by tram and funicular) and being in the historic centre of the city ,all major sightseeings (Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque, The Byzantine Hippodrome, The spice market, the Grand Bazaar, Galata Bridge etc) are in walking distance. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, it is a rather small one (approx 60 rooms) which are all big, very well equipped with huge bed, fine linen/pillows, a lot of storage room , wonderful bathroom and everything you need is inside (fluffy towels, slippers, bathsoaps including a wonderful cinnamon one) wooden floor and excellent cleaning.You are also provided with tea and coffee making facilities and turkish delights are offered in all rooms. Furthermore, its breakfast buffet is magnificent and it offers delicious meze-time from 13:00 to 19:00 hrs free of charge. We were also offered a free taxi transport from the airport to the hotel upon our arrival. Use of the pool, sauna and tzakouzi are also free of charge, you only pay if you need a massage. Furthermore, we were offered a 10% discount on several restaurants. Its best advantage though are the people working in it, who are all extremely nice, polite and eager to help, from beatiful PR Zeynep to the cleaning lady, the helpful young men in the reception who can find quick solutions to every problem , the polite waiters and waitesses in the breakfast room. Finally, the gesture of offering us a goodbye present was very much appreciated for its symbolism. If I must notice a disandantage, that would be that the rooms overlooking front (like 303) could be noisy and the ones overlooking back (like 306) have a view of a ugly building. But, that was not a problem for us since we only went to our room to sleep and there is a terrace with wonderful view of Bosporus on the top of the hotel.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alicante", "Title": "\u201cLovely staff\u201d", "Author": "Sallyalicante", "ReviewID": "UR128425208", "Content": "There is not much I can add, but we loved this hotel and it's staff.

The breakfast was wonderful and had changing items each day and the mezze provided an opportunity for our kids to chow down while we regrouped and planned the rest of our day.

From the point of booking the hotel staff were extremely pleasant to deal with, confirming the free airport transfer quickly and offering an 11% discount if we paid in cash which was very useful.

The hotel itself is very well maintained and our room was very pleasant, spacious, clean and tidy.We had free bottled water and a silver platter of turkish delights on our table The staff were very very good, making us feel immediately at home at check-in and everyone from the cleaner (who always said good morning), to the front desk staff, to the restaurant staff to the guy who was in charge of the swimming pool being exceptionally well-mannered, professional, and just pleasant to deal with. A real positive and something quite difficult to find in hotels we've travelled to The real factor that pushed this from a 4 to a 5 for us was what was (unexpectedly) included in the price. We had expected breakfast to be included, which was excellent (buffet of hot and cold everything of turkish and western european selections), but not the free glass of wine every night on the fantastic roof terrace overlooking the Bosphorus (surprisingly not shown on the hotel website), or the mezes from midday to 7pm every day, or the free half bottle of wine in our room to celebrate Easter.

After about 15 minutes on the way to the airport, his mobile phone rang and he was speaking for a minute or so and then asked me whether I had forgotten my camera bag in the lobby of the hotel. I checked and I had indeed forgotten it without realizing it! As I started to panic he just said not to worry, the hotel had already sent it by another car and it would meet us before we reached the airport. It did. No fuss no charge no worries.

The pool, jacuzzi, sauna and private hamam are all lovely, and the attendant there was so helpful it was a pleasure to use.

There is a rooftop terrace, but I was there in the winter off-season and didn't have a chance to use it. Breakfast is included and quite good. Negative: The bathroom was incredibly tiny - a result of a bad design choice in planning the rooms. Toilet, sink, and stand-up shower are packed tightly into a very small bathroom space, while on the other side of the wall there is unused space in the main part of the guest room. The furnishings are rather cheap in some areas, for examples the floors are artificial laminates rather than real wood. I noticed the floor already showing signs of serious wear in some places after only a few months use. This suggests the hotel will age quickly. Choices were made in the construction process to keep costs down, but in about 5 years, this hotel may be falling apart. Also, apart from breakfast, there is no restaurant or room service. Not really a problem since there are many nearby restaurants, but it would be nice to be able to call for a sandwich and a beer when working late. Overall, an excellent hotel. I would stay there again.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cGood value, Good service.\u201d", "Author": "TLCJJB", "ReviewID": "UR124745750", "Content": "For the price, this is an excellent location in Istanbul.

The welcome and service is (I would venture to say) beyond what even the Four Seasons offers. The price may be a bit steeper than other hotels in the area, but believe me, worth every penny. Factor in the free breakfast, free mezzes (which is really the equivalent of lunch), no charge for bottled water or drinks in the lobby, the FREE pickup from the airport, and this becomes the bargain of the decade. And IN ADDITION, the rooms are brand new (the building was totally renovated in 2007 when the hotel opened), with modern amenities, and a lovely little spa with sauna, swimming pool, and hot tub. About the ONLY suggestion I would have, would be to increase the counter/shelf space in the bathroom. I would also add that this is a great part of town to stay if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a tourist.

Neorion is unique! Day and night, before and after does matter to them. Before the trip, they already sent a welcoming email/s with suggested links, etc. We arrived in Istanbul early morning and the hotel airport transfer was patiently waiting even our flight was delayed and luggages took ages to come out. As it's very early, our room was not ready and the first thing, we were offered breakfast while waiiting for our early check-in. Our room was upgraded from what we booked and when we got to our room, there was a welcome letter from the hotel OWNER with his mobile number, in case we want to request or complain - great. The room's good and most important, very clean. The breakfast was good and the complimentary mezze in the afternoon also shows the personal touch. The environment in the hotel was so relax. Even after check-out while waiting for our transfer to the airport, we were still offered drinks and mezze. We dined in 2 of Sikerci group restaurants too. The food recommended was good and the service was great too. Neorion Hotel said goodbye with a bag of gift - turkish delights, traditional sweets and apple tea! Very sweet and thoughful and made you miss the city when you arrived home. The team even sent you to your car and wave goodbye. And that's not all, there's an email waiting for you hoping you have arrived safely. Truly Turkey hospitality!

The hotel staff went the extra mile to check my records to ensure I was entitled to a cash discount since initially they were under the impression I had made my reservations through a third party vendor. I got a free airport transfer that I was not aware of till the service was graciously brought to my attention. Not only did I get a little farewell package of the finest Turkish deserts and tea to say thank you for staying with them but the front desk attendant walked me out to the waiting car and shook my hands to bid me farewell and a safe journey.

Service here is outstanding, the rooms are comfortable and immaculate, and it's also quite a reasonable deal financially. I would absolutely recommend and stay again, however only if the hotel could ensure a room off the street side. The general street noise is bearable, but there is a nearby construction site which seemingly operates 24x7. We didn't notice on the first couple nights, likely because the site was shutdown for x-mas. But when it started up again there was loud heavy truck traffic, dumping noises, and general construction noise until well after 1 AM. Of course I can't fault the hotel as they have no control over the situation, but it should be a consideration for fellow travelers. In keeping with the fantastic service ethic of the hotel, they graciously offered us an upgraded room at a nearby sister hotel for our final night, which was very much appreciated. I don't think the noise would be noticeable in rooms away from the street, so if you're able to secure a quiet room (or if you're a heavy sleeper), I can whole-heatedly recommend the Neorion. I would also note, as a general bit of advice for first-time visitors to Istanbul, that the Sultanhamet area might be ideal only for a short stay. Most of the major sites are here, and quite near the hotel, however the area seems exclusively focused on tourism and you can knock out the sites in a couple solid days. After a few days it felt a bit stale. For longer visits to the city, I would stay in Kadikoy or the New District, which seem like more interesting and vibrant areas (and getting to Sultanhamet from either is very easy via tram or ferry).", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, believe the reviews!\u201d", "Author": "VamonosDeViaje", "ReviewID": "UR122283340", "Content": "Good location, nice hotel and everything the other reviews say but, what makes a difference is the service their staff provides to all guests, very friendly and ready to help in anything needed.

We had never been to Istanbul before and had heard all the horror stories about taxi rides, so the free transfer to the hotel with a driver was a real selling point. Unfortunately, due to air traffic control problems, our flight ended up coming in seven hours late, at 12:30AM, and the driver wasn't able to meet us. A quick phonecall to the hotel, and a new plan was sorted out, and we got a ride with a driver from another nearby hotel. A good reminder to always carry the contact information for the hotel with you, even if you will be picked up! After that, everything went smoothly, and the hotel was so welcoming and comfortable. The room was clean and quiet. We had a room on the 6th floor on the back of the hotel, so it did not have a view, but did have nice natural light and was very, very quiet. Wonderful touches in the room, including Turkish delight, and a fresh carnation sitting on the washcloths one evening. The staff were excellent help getting activities planned - we wanted to see the ceremony with the whirling dervishes, but had heard that the Medlevi Lodge might not be open, so had the concierge desk call the lodge for us, only to find it was closed. But not to worry, they found an alternative, which was closer by and perhaps better than the original. Dinner reservations were handled perfectly, and the hotel's sister properties had great food! The breakfast buffet was very good - lots of interesting choices. My favorite was the Easter bread, which is a slightly sweet and very soft bread with powdered sugar - a great sweet treat in the morning. There were lots of choices of cold cut meats, cheeses, breads, cereals, along with hot scrambled eggs, potato wedges and sausages. Everything was great! The mezes were available for about 6 hours in the afternoon! And had so many choices that we could make a late lunch out of the offerings. Our flight schedule was seriously messed up due to some kind of problem with Croatia Airlines and the Turkish Air Traffic Control, so not only did we arrive at 12:30AM, but we also ended up having our flight delayed outbound, and so found out the day before our departure that it was rescheduled to depart at 1:10AM. When we talked to the desk about having our bags held and arranging a driver, they checked the schedule, had a spare room, and actually rearranged things to allow us to stay in our same hotel room (free of charge!) until it was time to leave for the airport at 9pm!

It is sparkling new, with understated but elegant features such as marble trim and travertine stairways, museum-like pieces displayed in the common areas, and the beautiful clean tiled spa area. Mostly loved coming back after a day touring to warm greetings by people NOT selling you anything but the comfort of being home. Rooms are comfortable, convenient, and meticulously tidied daily. We stayed in the standard quality queen double room -- perfectly suited for a couple -- though not remarkable as hotel rooms go. The bed was comfortable, but morning came early with the amplified calls to morning prayer at nearby mosques preceding any hint of dawn (and there are always mosques nearby in Istanbul). The sunflower shower head makes for a wonderful shower. We stayed on the 5th floor, which had a very small balcony window and a teacup view of the Bosporus. The 6th floor has premium rooms, I think, and likely better views above the surrounding buildings, but the easily-accessible rooftop terrace has the best views. You will not suffer for lack of beautiful views in Istanbul, even if your hotel room does not have one. We loved the breakfast buffet, with plentiful combinations of sweet and savory, traditional Turkish (I suppose) and Continental/American -- they were able to accommodate both of our divergent breakfast needs. Although we did not take much advantage of the late afternoon buffet/snack, it appeared to be a nice assortment of foods to tide over hungry folk until the traditional 8PM dinnertime. . We took great advantage of the spa, using the sauna to warm away any chills, the whirlpool to massage aching backs (note the whirlpool/jacuzzi is not heated above pool temp.-- only about 82F -- which we liked once we got used to it) and the tiled-in pool to take leisurely laps (it is probably only 7.5m long). The spa became an everyday event following a day of sightseeing. The private steam baths and massage area looked inviting but we didn't indulge. It should be pointed out that the hotel location, while convenient to sights and transportation, is a little bit funky. The street, like many in Istanbul, is in a state of flux--evidencing both disrepair and construction. Neorion is one of only two nice hotels on the block, and it appears likely that others on Orhaniye street will soon be built and/or renovated. It is located just thirty meters off the tram line where bustling restauranteurs and shops provide services to both locals and tourists. Right near the hotel, the mix is more locals than tourists, in fact. Finally, and most importantly, the Neorion staff is its biggest selling point. Each was humble, warm, willing to assist with anything but without being over-solicitous. Nothing was expected in return for this service, except they seemed to appreciate our gratitude, and in fact we left with a small gift from the hotel staff! Everyone had good command of English, and I am told, a variety of languages. In a city full of merchants you have to be constantly vigilant. Many of the folks you encounter are hungry for tourist dollars/euros/lira, and although most transactions are conducted with politeness and humanity, there is still a sense of contest at every turn. Not so when you are welcomed \"home\" by the Neorion staff at the end of your day or evening. They greeted us with a sense that the contest was over for the day, we had all survived, so feel free to go get a bite, or a relaxing spa, or take a long winters nap.

The hotel is perfect for all regular people who do not use a wheelchair. There are few steps on the entrance and a few more entering the restaurent. when we entered the hotel my wife and I were a taken back since we booked the handicapped room in a hotel that was handicapped accessible, when we entered the room there was one low step entering the bathroom which caused a problem coming out of the bathroom and the bed was 40 cms below 50 to 55 cms which is the minimum for wheelchair users. We had a problem which needed to be solved. It was the start of Bayram the Islamic Turkish holiday and I was worried that people in charge were starting their holidays and I was wrong. The Night manager told me that he informed upper management of the situition and to please wait till the next morning till the problem is solved and the first management decision is that they will not charge us for the 1st night plus they will serve our breakfast in room. The next morning the owner Farouk came personally to see me after going over the points I mentioned he suggested we go see his other hotel the Sirkezi Konak (Number 4 tripadvisor) which we did The hotel entrance is accessible Farouk was great and we quickly became friends he assured me he will do his atmost to solve my problem and he did just that he ordered ramps for the neorion he did a ramp for the bathroom he elevated the bed we stayed 2 nights in the neorion and 7 nights in the Sirkezi Konak We loved it. Handicapped people should help establishments in stating their needs before booking HOTELS should be accessible if they claim they are and if they are less than that they should help handicapped people like these great people did Farouk and his managers in both hotels are scarse to fing nowadays they carry their responsibility and wont let it go until they please you People!!!!!!!!!!!

The Guest Relations staff began emailing us regarding airport pick-ups and finalizing details over a week before our trip, thus we felt secure that everything would be smooth. Our arrival at the reception area could not have been better; since the Neorion only has 54 rooms, it never felt crowded or pressured to hurry through anything (meals, coffee, discussions w/ guest relations). The initial welcome drink and tourist map overview were very welcome to get our bearings straight on where we were in Istanbul. A quick run down of using the tram/metro was nice, even though most things are user-friendly and/or in English. Our room was very well-appointed, with one of the biggest and most comfortable beds you can find in Europe (particularly from a boutique hotel). Nice hardwood floors, a lounge couch, and some neat artwork were very welcoming. The hotel is located in the Sultanahmet area, mostly known for tourist sites at the Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, and Grand/Spice Bazaars. Each of these is a 10-15 minute walk away, or 1-2 stops on the tram line. We felt the location was perfect for everything, even spots in the Iskital area, which takes about 30 minutes to reach. The true beauty of the Neorion is in it's staff. They go out of their way to ensure your experience in their city is a memorable one. From booking dining reservations (at their partner restaurants or others), to knowing the opening/closing times of nearly everything, they are there for you. We found the prices for coffee/wine to be better in the Neorion than nearly any other bar/cafe in town. In better weather, I'm sure the rooftop terrace would be a bustling area, however in mid-November, it was rainy and windy, thus meze was offered in the breakfast area. Breakfast included is a wonderful offer for many travelers, and with restaurants opening a little later in Istanbul, I'm not sure where else you'd go for a good cup of coffee (aside from the many Starbucks around). Warm and cold options are there for the taking, and again the small size of the hotel meant breakfast was never a swarming mass of people. Coffee and tea are both plentiful and tasty, and we enjoyed this each morning. The meze from 1400-1900 was a nice break in the day- we often came back from haggling in the markets or sightseeing for a quick snack and glass of wine/turkish coffee before heading back out. To repeat for the fourth time, the Neorion is truly the classiest hotel in Istanbul.

Although our accommodation at the Erboy was available as planned, we were offered the option of trying out the nearby, newly opened Neorion. This upgrade was at no extra cost. It had just recently opened and certain of the planned facilities were yet to be completed (such as the indoor swimming pool).

Nice touches such as thick toweling gowns, kettle with complimentary tea, coffee .. mini bar fridge, bottled water (and lovely Turkish Delight). An extensive buffet breakfast is served and is included in the price of the room. We found all the people within the Group (& Neorion in particular) - with whom we interacted, to be service driven with a genuine desire to be helpful. Both before our trip to Turkey and upon our return, we were contacted by the hotel's guest relations department to enquire if we required any assistance with our planned holiday and subsequently if we were satisfied with our stay. A map was provided upon arrival and we were given helpful tips to facilitate our intended itinerary - even the mobile number our the guest relations contact - should we experience any problems whilst out touring. Notwithstanding minor things that understandably still had to be sorted out / completed (reception area facilities etc) - we really have no complaints.

So..... after a few hours of waiting around, wondering what would happen to us, we were offered upgraded accommodation at the Neorion at no extra expense. Weren't we the lucky ones!! The Staff at the Neorion could not do enough to help us. One day we were to meet a group of school children (6 as well as their parents) and they were more than happy to let us gather in their hotel lounge room. My colleague and I had to leave early every morning (right on 7:00am) to get to the competition venue and to meet the children; the staff at the Neorion could not do enough to make sure we had breakfast and anything else we needed before we left for the day. We had an amazing time in Istanbul, mixing business ( The National Robotics Competition) with pleasure, that included lots of long, tiring days siteseeing. We returned every night to beautifully clean rooms, that were spacious and tastefully decorated. We loved the copper serving bowl full of turkish delight! This wonderful cultural experience could not have been possible without the thoughtful and amazing staff at the Neorion.

There was free coffee and thee, but no drinks (alcohol or soft drinks), except than in the minibar. The wonderfull terrace was not yet being used (no seat or anything).
