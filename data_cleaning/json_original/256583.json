The location is great with many of the attractions of Sydney within walking distance (to be honest Sydney's central area is so compact that getting around on foot is easy). If you want to go further afield the metro is just round the corner. Some great places to treat yourself to coffee for breakfast near by (My Sweet Memory was our choice but the QVB is not far away which gives you even more choice) and a large Woolworth and a well stocked bottle shop to get supplies for supper. The two bedroom (one en-suite) apartment was large and spotlessly clean (and kept so by the helpful and cheerful cleaning staff) with everything we needed (although it took us until the last evening to find the chopping board). We had a room on the 25 floor which gave views towards the Chinese Garden of Friendship and was very quiet. There was plenty of space to relax, write cards and play games.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment on a higher floor with a balcony. Check-in was smooth & the staff were pleasant & helpful. I have to say they were great during the entire stay & acknowledged us each and every time we walked past the reception desk. The room was very spacious & the furniture fairly simple but with an added Barcelona chair (for design geeks). The Televison was a plasma & had plently of the local cable channels, there was also a mini Stereo player althogh this was not a dvd player it did also act as an ipod dock. It may be better to have a weay of connecting PC's or Ipods/Ipads to the TV screen in possible. The bathroom was large with a shower over the bath there was also a Washer & Dryer which we made plenty of use out of during our stay The Bed was very comfortable & there were plently of pillow options. Overall the bedroom was comfortable & had a second wall mounted plasma TV although I was woken at 4am on one of the first mornings as a previous guest seemed to have set the 'wake' function on the television. I wish hotels would have housekeeping check any device in the room with an alarm after each check-out to make sure said device does not go off in the middle of the night for the next guests! The Kitchen I have to say was a little bit old but all the appliances worked, the utensils were a little old as well though & some a little worn out. I had all the utensils I needed to cook with though. There is an oven, Microwave, toaster, kettle, stove, full size fridge & a dishwaser which housekeeping kindly ran for me each day although on a couple of occasions I could've waited until it was a little more full to save some water but, nevermind I appreciated the touch none-the-less. The stove is a glass top electrical style which is not the greatest for gourmet cooking but, being a hotel I understand this from a safety standpoint. Sadly I did not use the gym during my stay & the Pool which is outdoors but covered seemed to be emptied for rennovation. I used the internet which seems expensive at $25 per day however I could connect 2x devices at a time which was good for my laptop & ipad. Once connected the speed was good. Overall I would stay again & recommend the hotel to anyone who wants a more comfortable space & to feel like you're in your own apartment rather than a run of the mill hotel. It's centrally located & has great staff. There are some great dining options just outside the door to with Chinatown not so far away.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, NC", "Title": "\u201cMixed bag\u201d", "Author": "G V", "ReviewID": "UR127603541", "Content": "Stayed here early Feb.'12. Day time desk staff barely took the time to make eye contact, but night staff was very attentive. Internet access and laundry were outrageously priced. I found the room uncomfortable for the first two nights as the air con was not blowing cool. Tried adjusting the thermostat in the room (the \"down\" button was crushed and faded from countless hundreds of other guests trying in vain to lower the temperature). The staff informed me that it was inherent to the hotel's air handling system (read: sorry, it can't be helped) and they sent a fan up to my room. While not a complete solution, I appreciated the effort. The following day an actual technician came by while I was out and fixed the air con. This was great, but left me wondering why it had to be fixed on the 3rd day of a 4 night stay. Are they so accustomed to getting complaints about the A/C that they routinely disregard them as 'the same old complaint that we can't do anything about'? Told the same desk staff on day 1 that the elliptical machine in the \"gym\" was squeaking and needed a bit of oil on the bearing. This is a $1 fix. This was not attended to. The rest of the fitness equipment was antiquated and seized up due to a sloppy spray paint job that bled onto the moving surfaces of the machines. My travel department booked some of my co-workers and I at the Medina Grand, and some at the nearby Park Royal. Having seen the digs at the Park Royal, I would book there if you're traveling to the CBD of Sydney. On the plus side: Once the room was cool, it was comfortable. The location is also great. The kitchenette was a nice feature that enabled me to hit Woolworths and stock up on basics, which saved money on food.

I have to say I booked this property based upon the good reviews on tripadvisor and convinced myself that the few poor reviews were exceptions. We booked a 2 bedroon, 2 bathroom apartment here for 5 people for 5 days (including a 3 year old). Here are the + and - of our stay: First the +'s: 1. It really is a great central location near to Darling Harbour and Shopping area 2. The bedrooms are reasonably sized and there is a good sized living room. 3. The apartment had good washer and dryer facilities (but no soap provided so take your own). The porter was helpful. Now the -'s: 1. After a long flight to Sydney, we had to wait 4 hours before we got a room. When we finally got a room, Reception told us that there was a smell in the room and placed a humidifier in it. We were told to turn the humidifier off when we were in the room and turn it on when we left! Having turned it off, the smell was unpleasant so we asked to change rooms. We got a room directly 2 floors above. Why give out a room when 1. you know there is a smell in it and 2. you have another available 2 floors above? 2. I have never seen as much mould in hotel bathrooms as there was in this apartment. We were on a trip of the Far East and Australia and this was 1 of 8, four star properties we stayed at. The shower in the ensuite bathroom was covered in it. There was less in the other bathroom but much more than I would have liked to see. The back of the fridge had a layer of mould on it too. I complained about this the next day. Reception said they would send someone to deep clean the next day. I have no idea if they did or not, but I noticed no difference. The next day I was asked whether it had been cleaned and I told them that, the only way they could get rid of that mould was to re-grout the bathrooms. He made a note. 3. The room had views of the walls and if you stuck your head out enough you could see some buildings towards Darling Harbour. 4. The kitchen is not equiped to cook for a family of 5. The 1 egg sized camping frying pan and butchers knives were comical. We asked for bigger pots and got one. 5. Unfortunatley Sydney was cold and rainy during our stay. The hotel's air conditioning system was set to cold so it was not possible to turn the heat on. We were given one portable fan heater to heat up the apartment! Having read some of the poorer reviews and the hotel manager's responses, I informed the hotel of our problems whilst we were on site to see if they could rectify the situations.

Market St where you can find Myer and David Jones and the Pitt St Mall is just a short walk and going the other way down George St you can find World Square and further down is Chinatown and Paddys Market. If you go down the hill at Bathurst you can cross a bridge and get easy access to Darling Harbour. Town Hall Railway Station is close by (go through the undergound arcade where Kathmandu store is). The hotel has a small lobby, 2 lifts, and a small cafe on the corner (free wi fi in the cafe). We stayed on the 10th floor in a spacious 2 bedroom apartment facing east (2 bathrooms and laundry, well equipped kitchen). Small balcony and not much of a view but I think the rooms on the west side would have views of Darling Harbour especially if you are above the 20th floor. Free newspapers delivered to your room in the morning. Lots of dining options nearby. Tetsuya's is on the same street but only for the well heeled traveller. If you like Ramen - try Menya at the north end of kent St or Aisen Ramen. From the airport you can catch the SkyTrain for about AUD16 takes about 30 mins but you have to lug your own luggage through the train station (get off at Town Hall Station) or we caught a taxi about AUD50.

Originally we booked a standard 2 bedroom apartment but was given one on level 10 with a poor view. The reception staff worked hard to find another one and was able to give us another one on the same floor with a slightly better view. So we asked for an upgrade to a premier room and was given an upgrade for 50% off the normal price to the 27th floor ... SUPERB views of Sydney and the Darling Harbour. GREAT location. Diagonally across is the Town Hall train station. A short 5 min walk is the monorail, light rail and bus stops. 20 min walk to Powerhouse Museum (we saw Harry Potter exhibition), Capitol Theatre (Mary Poppins) and The Domain. 10 min walk to Darling Harbour and the ferries. We snuck out of the Carols early, made it back to the hotel (via train) in 20 mins and in time to see the Carol fireworks from our apartment window. We bought a metro pass (all transport methods) for a week - cost $40 adult and $19 for all children. This was the best, easiest and fastest way to get around and we even got the train from the airport to Town Hall station and walked across to the Medina. Apartment was great. 2 bedrooms with comfortable beds and we got a roll away which was placed in the lounge area. 2 bathrooms which came in handy with 3 girls and a kitchen with microwave, stove, fridge, dishwasher and all the cooking and eating utensils. Laundry was through the 2nd bathroom. Room service was daily - they only replaced 4 towels (not one for the 5th guest) but the kids swam in the pool daily where there were fresh towels - so they would bring up extras. Didn't use internet as we had a prepaid mobile internet USB but we had great coverage. Staff were great - reception met our request with the upgrade and printed off tickets and boarding passes. Asif was a terrific attendant - giving us advice, telling us to call him at housekeeping should we ever need anything and bringing up things to the apartment. He saw us on the way out struggling with 3 suitcase and helped us out. He always greeted us and made us feel known and welcome. The gentleman who booked us in (wish I got his name) always greeted us also and he remembered what we were doing on which days and would ask us how it went - very friendly! We ordered groceries from Woolworths online. Woolies delivered them to reception and Asif bought them up to the apartment. Woolworths is a short 5 min walk past the Town Hall. We ate breakfast there daily and sometimes lunch and dinner. Housekeeping would clean up and turn the dishwasher on daily. Coffee, Tea and sugar were replaced daily but milk is only complimentary on the first day. Close to many restaurants - within walking distance. 20 min walk from David Jones where we saw the Christmas windows and 10 min walk to Hyde Park and Paddy's Market. Darling Harbour playground with water activities is also a great place to visit with the kids. Only complaint - which is nothing the hotel can do anything about - was the noise of the sirens (often through the night) and the bells of the Cathedral which rang for HOURS on Sat and Sun mornings :( After awhile we got used to the bells while we were awake - slightly painful at 9am when you're trying to sleep in.

Had a no fuss check-in although we had a late check-in at around 7pm. The apartment itself was very spacious and nicely decorated. Kitchen looked a bit dated but very much adequate as to their needs. Room was also nice and bed was comfortable (I tried it out). Was a great plus that they had Foxtel channels. Location wise it was excellent. Just a stone throw away from Town Hall train station and a short walk to Darling Harbour. Expected it to be a little noisy as it was on the corner of Kent and Bathurst Street but it was actually fine. The negatives of the apartment was that the air-conditioning wasn't exactly cold and was a little stuffy. Sometimes after a long day around the city, we'd head back and you could barely feel the air-conditioning even after it was left on for a long time. However, opening the windows did help a lot as it was spring time. While not needed at all times, it would have been a nice to have to just cool down. Secondly, I was a little disappointed that we had to pay for clothes washing powder and softener. I stayed in a service apartment myself when I first came to Sydney and I was provided with sufficient detergents, washing powder, softener and etc to last me the full 14 days I was booked in for. While I do not expect Medina Grand to provide an entire 1L bottle of detergent or softener, it would have been a nice touch to provide a complimentary pack (sufficient for 1 full wash) as we were booked in for 8 nights. I believe that's a fair amount to provide and if anyone needs more than 1 wash per week then they'll have to pay. Overall, I have to say that the experience was good. The service was good, apartment was very good and location was excellent.

The bedroom and living areas are functional but not luxurious. The bed is my biggest complaint. It is just plain uncomfortable. The bed is the quality of a very cheap bargain basement spring bed.

We had planned the holiday for 6 months as we bought very cheap Virgin air fares when they were on sale and because we looked at the same time found a good deal on the price of the accomodation. Even if you look on the internet it can sometimes pay to ring the hotel and ask what their best prices are as they will sometimes better the internet price. Anyway we accepted their deal but had to book and pay for the hotel then and there. There were no refunds or changes allowed but we are talking a difference of hundreds of dollars so if you are game (and if you take out travel insurance) you can get yourself a good deal too. We had stayed at a Medina in Melbourne last year so were familiar with the size of their rooms and their amenities. As I have a bad back I look for hotels that have a heated pool so I can exercise every morning. This hotel had the pool and it was ok except that although covered overhead one side of the pool area is exposed to the outside air making it freezing when getting out of the pool. The area and pool were always clean and well maintained and there were plenty of towels. There is also a gym for guests use. Our room was on the 26th floor and faced a wall but we had a small balcony that we could see a bit of Darling Harbour on one side and some of the lights of Sydney on the other. There was a lot of traffic noise when the door to the balcony was open but having fresh air was great. When the door was shut there was no noise. The room was not huge but big enough for 2 and had a toaster, microwave, sink, small fridge, crockery, cutlery and some food preparation dishes and utensils. It had everything most rooms normally have, tv, clock radio etc plus a table and 2 chairs and plenty of wardrobe space, a safe and an ironing board and iron. The room was clean and serviced daily as was the bathroom. The shower (over the bath) was great with good water pressure. What they didn't have that the Medina in Melbourne had was a small communal laundry for guests to use. In Melbourne there was one for the studio guests to use as the other rooms had washing facilities in them. It was only the size of wardrobe but had a washer, dryer and sink in it. I missed having this and it meant I had to take more clothes with us. This hotel does have a laundry service but like all hotels it was expensive. The only things that I would suggest to improve this hotel is for the bed to be a little firmer and higher. It was very low, I hit my arm several times on the bedside table while sleeping as the bed was level with the bedside table. With the bed so soft and with soft sides it wasn't very stable to sit on the edge and as it was so low not always easy to get in and out of (for someone with a bad back). The other thing that would be good would be to have a comfortable chair to sit in. I have yet to find any hotel with a comfy chair in your room where you can sit in a read a book and lets face it we can't be out sight seeing and shopping every minute of the day. The location of the hotel was great. Next time we will get the train into the city (you get off at Town Hall station) from the airport because it is literally a five minute walk to the hotel through the Town Hall Square shopping centre and is all under cover. When you walk out of the shopping centre the hotel is just across the road. In this shopping centre there is a Woolies supermarket, a Subway, as well as a variety of food shops, a chemist and newsagent as well as lots of other shops.This shopping centre leads to The Queen Victoria Building, The Galleries shopping centre, even the Westfield shopping centre and the mono rail. If you are like my husband there are 2 Starbucks within 5 minutes of the hotel as well as Krispy Kreme donuts, McDonalds, Hungary Jacks and hundres of eateries giving you a ton of choice. We found the Albion Hotel value for money with a lovely rump steak dinner for $9.90 with a drink purchase and if you don't mind a bit of noise the Edinburgh Castle Hotel do a good schnitzel even at 9pm at night. Paddy's market and Market City are only 10 minutes walk away, Darling Harbour is about the same and Circular Quay is about 20minutes walk away. We bought ourselves a weekly 'Multi 1' ticket for $41 each and this took us every where we wanted to go. Circular Quay and the Rocks (the markets are huge on Saturday and Sunday) is only 2 stops away on the train and to go to the Paddington markets on a Saturday take the train to Museum (4 stops away) and catch a bus just outside the station and go down Oxford Street. Catch the ferry to Manly for breakfast on a Sunday and visit the Manly markets (many of the same stalls from the Paddington markets) or take the ferry to Watson's Bay and have fish and chips sitting under a Morton Bay Fig tree. We took a ride on the ferry up to Parramatta and back just for the ride. All this for the price of our tickets, that is better value than the $20 one day ticket and a lot cheaper than going on a cruise around the harbour. Sydney is a great place for a holiday and my husband can highly recommed the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb. The Medina is certainly a place we would go back to especially if we can get a great deal like we had this time. If we had to pay full price I am not sure I would.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGenerally fine\u201d", "Author": "Daren L", "ReviewID": "UR117218477", "Content": "I recently spent 2 nights in a Studio room.

The room was clean and generously sized, with a large bathroom that had a full-sized bath and shower over bath, the most amazing thing about the shower over bath was that you could take a proper shower and manage to keep the bathroom floor dry! I travel quite a bit with work, and normally find that shower over bath set-ups end up leavign water all over the bathroom floor, so this was a welcome change, and a great functional design. Back into the main room and there is a small kitchenette in the corner, a table and chairs, as well as a small workdesk - everything I needed during my stay. There is also a large wardrobe with mirrored sliding doors - no hunting around for tiny hotel mirrors, these mirror doors are great! The TV sit on the side of the workdesk, and is easilly viewed form bed, or from the table and chairs, it's a reasonable sized flat screen as you'd expect and has all of the free to air channels including HD. The only downside was the pay TV channels, I'd been told by my booking agent (admittedly not the hotel) that there was a number of pay TV channels, I assumed the standar package with Lifestyle, Discovery, Sports and a Music channel, but instead I found the only pay TV channels were all sports channels with the exception of Arena. A little disappointing but didn't really make a big difference, and like I said, it was the booking agent who failed to properly manage my expectations here, not the hotel. Finally, I must mention the staff. They were exactly the way I like them, friendly and professional without being pretentious. Everythign was smooth and trouble free with everyone I spoke to, and I was treated like a person rather than a number or an unapproachable exec. I really appreciate that sort of service and rarely find it - If people from the Medina are reading this, keep doing whatever you're doing to find, train and keep your great staff - they turned a good place to stay into a great place to visit.

Could not fault the fit out, it was all newish and functional - own laundry, dishwasher, etc. But I did bring my coffee plunger from home, as there is only a kettle for instant coffee, which is not good enough for us. The lounge, dining, kitchen shared area was spectacular and really spacious with 180 degree views to Darling Harbour and over the city including towards Hyde Park and the Sydney tower. Our apt was a corner suite, hence the views and spaciousness plus we were on the 23rd floor (out of 24). I could not comment on smaller 1 bed apts or those not on the corner, but everyone in the lift seemed very happy to be staying at the Hotel. They also have 3 bed apts. We arrived on Australia Day, 26 Jan, so we saw the fireworks over Darling Habour from our Apt balcony. WOW - that was an unexpected treat. It is a 5 minute walk to Town Hall metro station, and can be done underground if raining or really hot. This train line connects directly to the airports and is about a 20 minute train trip. We took the train both directions,my mother could manage it easily. The train takes about 8 minutes to Circular Quay, where all the action is. The station is disability friendly. For seniors, the trains in Sydney are very cheap. bring your seniors card, many discounts to attractions. Town Hall station has several lines passing through it. The light rail, above ground, also has a stop a few blocks away. The hotel is on the edge of China Town, so we enjoyed the Year of the Rabbit being launched that weekend, too. The adventure shops are on this block, so Kathmandu, Paddy Palin, Mainpeak and more such shops are handy. It is 5 minutes to a Woolworths, open til midnight, by Town Hall station, so easy to shop for food. Queen Victoria Galleries, etc all within 5-10 minutes walk. Lots of cheaper Asian cafes around, as well as Tetsuia's about 5 minutes away if you want to splurge. We splurged at Quay restaurant overlooking the Opera House. Darling Harbour with its abundance of cafes and attractions is 5 minutes downhill from hotel. So - yes, a perfect location. We thought the room was very good value, booked on line with Visa Platinum. First time I had used this site, and saved about $400 over the 5 day stay. This hotel is a good location for people with mobility problems. My mother could manage with her cane as everything was quite flat or there were lifts and escalators everywhere. Also taxis are constantly passing. The hotel recommended the Thai massage a block away and it was far more pleasant than our massage at the Observatory Hotel spa which was 3 times the price. The Thai massage was actually really really good. Great healers. We had a fabulous time and the young desk staff were friendly and helpful. I would return to this hotel even for a romantic holiday as the view is so spectacular.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cGood location, bad service\u201d", "Author": "Cdntraveller56", "ReviewID": "UR92226734", "Content": "Clean hotel in a good location but the front desk staff could learn a thing or two about customer service.

Opening windows for fresh air were another bonus even though it's quite noisy when you do open them. All the comforts you would expect from a 4* property including a great poo area, in a very convenient location. Located right in the Spanish 1/4 and only a short walk to Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Haymarket and 1 block from Town Hall railway station made for easy access to all of Sydney's attractions. Staff were friendly and helpful and it's nice to have secure on site car parking when visiting the city from the country. The hotel was initially a little difficult to find as it is surrounded by one way streets and our Google maps directions were incorrect (sending us the wrong way up 1 way streets) so would recommend carefully planning your route if driving. Car park entrance is right by hotel entrance and you can drive straight in when you arrive so don't have to fuss around finding a parking spot in order to check in. Our only glitch was that we had booked a rollaway bed and even though I rang the hotel the day before to confirm our booking and advise that we would be arriving late - the rollaway for our 4yo was not in the room at 8pm. It finally arrived after 9pm so we were a little disappointed with this. The good thing was that the rollaway was a \"proper\" bed with a full thickness mattress not just a flimsy camp style bed like we have had in other major brand name hotels. We took advantage of the order in menu on our first night and were impressed with the meals and service on a Friday night. We also ate breakfast in the cafe one morning and liked the freshly cooked options available (as opposed to hotel buffets). Room was serviced daily and mini-bar replenished daily.

We only found this out after turning the thermostat up in our room and leaving it for an hour thinking it might take time to kick in... meanwhile the system blew out cold air and the room temp kept dropping! I had a newborn with me and a toddler - it was so bad we had to buy fleecy tracksuits to wear over their PJs, and my baby was covered with cold damp throw rugs.

Definately avoid this place unless the weather is perfectly in tune with their central heating and cooling system or you will freeze.

While it was not perfect, it made for a pleasant stay. It was spacious, clean, and well-appointed (I've uploaded a video of our apartment so you can see for yourselves). As we got a \"last-minute\" rate on-line, it was a great deal. It was a lot cheaper for us, three adult females, than two hotel rooms would have been. We were able to eat breakfast and dinner in, most nights (Safeway was just around the corner), which saved us a lot of money. All of the basic utensils you'd need to prepare and eat a meal, are provided. The kitchen has a stove, oven, microwave, dishwasher, electric kettle, toaster, and full-sized fridge as well as pots and pans, dishes, glassware, and cutlery. A 250ml (8oz) container of milk is provided gratis, which was good for us for coffee the first morning, as we arrived at night. All other things provided (except instant coffee, teabags, and sugar) are \"mini bar expensive\". The next morning I went to Safeway and got some essentials. The beds were comfortable enough and all came with doonas with removable covers (so I'm assuming they are washed more than typical hotel bedspreads as they looked clean). Sheets and towels were all of high quality. Our 2BR apt had two bathrooms, one an en-suite attached to the \"master\" bedroom. It contained a sink, shower, and toilet (the shower control works very easily, and as it's right next to the soap dish, be careful not to knock it while reaching blindly for the soap or washcloth, or you'll get burnt or frozen! It was quite a shock!). The other \"main\" bathroom had a shower-over-bath, sink, and toilet. Water pressure was great in both. Both bathrooms had shelves above the sinks for cosmetics and sundries, very handy, and both were modern and clean. And the main bathroom had a retractable clothesline over the tub, as well as a cupboard which contained the washer, dryer, and ironing implements. You really could live there! All carpets were clean and unstained, the furniture likewise. We didn't hear any \"street noise\" worthy of note up on the 29th floor. I know others have mentioned it, so maybe there was some event on at that time. We were there for 3 weeknights, so maybe the weekends are noisier? Location-wise, it was excellent. Town Hall (train) station was about a minute away on foot, as were many shops and restaurants (the Medina has a breakfast cafe, but we didn't go there. There is also Tom & Tom's Coffee next door). Darling Harbour was a short walk, and Circular Quay (up in the vicinity of the Bridge and Opera House) was about a 15-20 minute pleasant walk. We were easily able to walk to the Aquarium. For those who aren't into walking too much, the train from Town Hall Station arrived at Circular Quay in two stops. While the girls climbed the Bridge, I took a Harbour tour on Captain Cook Cruises. It was breathtaking and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I got some great photos (including the girls climbing on the bridge!). As it's a \"hop on/hop off\" tour ticket, it stops at many sites of interest aroudn the Harbour. And I was able to get off at Pier 26, close to my hotel. Fantastic! I was surprised to find that there were no public internet facilities for guests. To be fair, each unit has internet facilities as long as you bring your laptop (we didn't, as we had to leave our bags in the car for a few hours prior to flying to Sydney and were afraid of theft). We incorrectly assumed that there would be one or two PCs in a public room or Business Centre that we could use for checking email, and whatever else. Not so. We were directed to a local convenience store which offered cheap internet, but man, were those computers grubby, and I wasn't comfortable typing my passwords into those machines. So I used my phone's internet capabilities, instead. There was a gym and pool but we neither used nor saw either as we had only a few days to take in the sights of Sydney. One complaint we all had (and I mean EVERYONE, not just us) was the sad state of the lifts. There are only two, and one was out of order. One lift for 29 floors worth of guests was ridiculous, and it usually meant a LONG wait for it to collect us at the top floor, and another long wait in a can of sardines as it stopped at virtually every floor on the way down. There does not appear to be a service lift, since we often had to share with housekeeping carts and the like, which was ridiculous. I was told by a lift worker that the broken lift is problematic, has broken down before, and needs big $$ spent on it (I got the impression that they keep doing band-aid fixes). I asked what would happen if BOTH lifts broke and the guy said with a chuckle, \"You'd be doing a lot of stair climbing\" (I don't THINK so!). He said that even having two working lifts was inadequate for a building this size. Climbing twenty-nine flights would simply be unacceptable. I'd need a holiday after my holiday! I would ask them to collect my things, check me out, and put me and my arthritic knees up elsewhere! For others like me, the lift situation may be something to enquire about before booking, I think! I shudder to think what a disabled person would do! Your apartment can be serviced daily, if needed. We found that although the \"do not disturb\" sign was hung on the door (the flip side was \"Please make up my room\"), housekeeping had come in as the bath mat was rolled up when I returned. I think it's primarily to count mini-bar items. Overall, we had a pleasant stay at the Medina Sydney Central. Other than the lift thing, I would happily recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, VIC", "Title": "\u201cA good apartment hotel right in the heart of the CBD\u201d", "Author": "karzrao", "ReviewID": "UR34875548", "Content": "If your looking for an apartment hotel, this one is not too bad.

Did not use the gym, but the pool was very welcome on our 40+ degree day in Sydney, and had surprisingly few people using it considering the temperature outside. Also, given the fact that the hotel was located in the middle of a busy city, we found it to be quite quiet. Only concerns were firstly with the single beds in the second bedroom, they were able to be zipped into one larger bed, which I know is quite normal, but when separated, they were extremely soft and rather narrow. The other issue was the extreme price of the in-room broadband internet. The plans appeared complicated in their explanation, and I think I would have had to pay $90 per day for access.

View was straight up Bathurst Street (ie no view). I was there during world youth week, and I had a lot of trouble with noise. This is in a quieter part of town normally, but the noise of cars and people is very audible, even with all doors shut and curtains closed. The party may as well have been in my room. You also get the noise of churchbells from just up the road, but this is not as annoying by itself, and is not constant of course. Just very loud. The staff were very helpful, but the place was so tired looking. It looked exactly what it was - an overcleaned, overused serviced apartment. There were marks and stains on everything, the kitchen was not very good - very grubby and lacking basic utensils - no chopping knives or boards (previous occupiers had clearly just used the laminate worktop to chop things), dirty pans and a kettle that was so awful I had to scrub and boil it about 4 times before it was approaching usable. The first thing I did on arrival was put everything through the dishwasher or washed it up myself. On the plus side, it was spacious, with a large bathroom (shower over the rather shallow tub), and a very useful utility area with a washing machine and dryer. The layout was well designed. The television was very old fashioned, and did require a lot of manual button pushing (ie the remote only changed channels really - I had to switch on and off on the set, and also adjust the volume on the set), plus it was a small old screen). There was a hosuekeeping service every day which varied according to who you got. Each cleaner seemed to have their own idea as to what they would do or not do, which made it quite interesting in some ways to see at night what had been done that day. The \"gym\" is tiny, and consists of one treadmill, a couple of bikes and a few free weights. The pool also is more of a tiny lap pool, better for splashing in. I only saw one other person there during my whole stay. The lifts are very very slow, they tend to shut one down a lot, and then it is all stops up and down. Not a large lift either - 4 people and luggage and it is bursting. Whilst I was there, the apartment next door was rented by a family for a week, and the cooking smells did permeate the hallway, and under my door - I knew what they were eating 3 times a day. Not very effective ventilation. I realise this can be an issue in all apartment blocks, but the low ceilings really did cause smells to linger nastily. As a whole, I would not recommend it - location is pretty ordinary, and the apartments are tired. The staff are generally very friendly tho'. I did have one issue on the last day when I specifically called down to reception to request an extra hour to check out. This was readily granted, but then at exactly one minute past the normal check out time I received a call reminding me of the time and asking me in a rather rude abrupt tone why I had not yet left?

The only downsides - a dishwasher that was hard to start (but then the room service attendant would turn it on for us anyway) and a slight delay on collecting our bags on the day we checked out (but then it was a public holiday, Australia Day, and the apartment may have been shortstaffed). The location is excellent, with an easy walk to most amenities and attractions and a large choice of dining options nearby.

We went for a walk and we came back the room was ready. We went to our apartment, and to our surprise the room was a 2 bedroom WITHOUT an extra bed.

We went to reception and showed - AGAIN - the voucher and empahside the fact that we had a 3 bedroom apartement. As logic indicates, the moved us to a 3 - bedroom apartment. After losing a lot of time, we left the hotel to go and enjoy the city. When we came back, in our room we had a note from a man named Robert something. He said that if we wanted to stay in that apartemente we had to pay an extra 200 Dollars per night since, in spite of what the voucher said, our travel agent had booked us a 2 bedroom apartment. We understood that our travel agent made the mistake, so 5 minutes after reading that note we went to the reception and told them that we were not going to pay that diference, that we wanted to move again to the 2 bedroom but, this time, with the extra bed. The answer from the man of the reception was that since this guy Robert went home he couldn\u00c2\u00b4t anything..... After speaking whit him and made him understand that if that night they left us in that room, under NO circustances we were going to pay the extra 200 dolars, he said that nobody coud help us in the hotel because robert went home and that all he could say. We finally stay that night in that apartment and first thing the next morning we spoke with this Robert and explain him the whole situation. BUT HE SAID THAT, in spite that we BEG them to move us to a 2 bedroom the night before, WE HAD TO PAY THE 200 DOLLARS for the night. We told him that we were not going to pay for that, so he said he would speak to out travel agent in Australia and see if they would pay for that difference and he PROMISED he would give an aswer that day. And we also asked him to move us again to a 2 bedroom w extra bed.. Guess what happen? Till the end of our stay we never had any news from Robert and that day when we came back to the hotel we had the 2 bedroom apartmente...but WITHOUT THE EXTRA BED. After we went to the reception and complaint about it, they finally gave us the extra bed. A few days later, one of the guys of the reception (the only one that had manners and cared about the guests) told me \"off the record\" that he heard our australian travel agente was going to pay for the difference (which, btw, i think thay shouldnt because that first night we specifically told them we wanted the 2 bedroom Netiher this guy Robert nor any other person apologize for the inconvinience or helped in other way during our stay.
