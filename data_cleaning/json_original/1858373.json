It looked like nohing fancy from outside. Inside was well decorated. Rooms were smaller than normal. Had many problems at this hotel. We started off the first day with leaving the room around 9 am and returning around 4:30, the room had not been cleaned. The second complaint was that we tried to go swimming and the water was freezing cold. My children, husband and I couldn't even swim for more than 2 minutes. The next day breakfast was horrible. Runny eggs, hard bacon. Yuck!!! That night when we returned we decided to order food from fliers that were placed under door. That was a SCAM!!!! WE waited for over an hour and then we finally got our food from A TASTE OF ITALY. The order was wrong and the brought us a pizza in a Little Ceasars pizza box. We tried to get refund but ever recieved one. The hotel staff said they would they to get us our refund so they placed a huge order over the phone. The man at front desk said I will call you when they come back, but as we were getting on the elevator, he called and canceled the order speaking spanish. That night we did't even eat dinner because it was already so late. We didn't even sleep the night either because people were arguing on our floor and car alarms were going off. Trying to check out was a nightmare as well. Elevators were down. We had to wait at least 30 minutes to take our luggage downstairs.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice hotel, but it's definitely overrated! It's hard to access, the parking is very limited, check-in could be quicker, the meal I had in the restaurant was nothing spectacular... and I should mention one of the only 2 elevators just happened to go out while I was staying there. That was a major inconvenience; especially considering there were no stairwells that I could find to access my floor quicker. I could go on... Bottom line it's a nice hotel (good, but certainly not great). I'd stay there again, but by no means was I overly impressed by anything. It's definitely overrated on this site.

Would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good clean place to stay and we walked around the hotel and it was safe and did not feel like we were indanger at all.

We stayed there for one night post cruise. This is a beautiful new hotel! We finished our cruise at around 9:00am and left the port with friends in a taxi to go to the airport. They were flying home immediately and we went along for the ride. We called the hotel and they said the shuttle would be there shortly. It arrived about 10 minutes later. There were already a bunch of other guests and their luggage in the shuttle. After a short 10-15 minute ride, we arrived at the hotel. Arnold, at the front desk, checked us in. He is a very pleasant and friendly young man. Very professional and efficient. Since we arrived rather early, before the official check-in time, he informed us that the rooms were not quite ready. He offered to store our luggage for us and said that he figured a room would be available in about an hour. We decided to sit outside by the pool where we enjoyed a pleasant conversation with a family that was also waiting. Arnold came to find us less than an hour later and told us that a room was ready for us. This was wonderful service! He completed the check-in process and we were in our room by 11:30. The room was AMAZING! The decor is modern and comfortable. It was a beautiful, clean room with modern fixtures and accessories. There was a HUGE flatscreen LG TV. The air-conditioning was quiet and steady. There was a fridge and a microwave in the room along with a small safe. The bathroom was gorgeous! Granite countertops. Brushed nickel faucets and towel bars. I felt like I was living in the proverbial 'lap of luxury'- straight out of a designer magazine!! Since we had some time, we decided to take the city bus that goes down Flagler St. to visit downtown Miami. The bus picked us up about one block east of the hotel. It should be noted that the city bus costs $2. per person but will not give change.( ie. If you put in a $5. or $10. bill for 2 people, you will not get change.) So make sure you take some $1. bills along. The bus took us all the way to the downtown where we got off close to the government buildings. We then caught the FREE metro mover that has a terminal in the government building and toured the city from the elevated ride. (We just asked the locals how/where to access entry) We got off the metro-mover at Bayside Park and had a wonderful time strolling through the park and the adjacent shopping center. It was a Saturday afternoon and there were lots of interesting sights to see and good food, music and drinks to enjoy. After about 3 hours, we boarded the free metro-mover again and toured to the Omni station and back just for the fun of it. We got off the metro mover at the Government Buildings stop and took the Flagler St. city Bus #11 back towards the hotel. We got off at 37th St. to buy some snacks at the Publix grocery store on Flagler. After buying our munchies, we walked the few blocks back to the hotel (on Flagler by 42nd). We felt totally safe throughout our excursion and met some interesting people. When we got back to the hotel, we printed out our flight tickets for the following day on the hotel's complimentary computers. We noticed that people were eating dinner in the hotel restaurant and it looked very inviting. However, having just finished our cruise, we were not in need of an other large meal and we were content to stick with our few munchies as we watched some TV later in our room. In the future, I think we would possibly choose to eat at the restaurant since the ambience was delightful. Candlelight, flowing water-fall wall scape, just lovely... and romantic! We slept well and arrived in the lobby at 6:30am to catch the 7:00 shuttle for the airport. The shuttle driver was right on time and brought us, and 2 other families, safely to the airport. Our flight was scheduled for 8:30 and we had plenty of time. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again in the future.

This meant my husband had to go down, get in line and wait again to get this issue fixed. The check-in clerk didn't even apologize. That being said - the rooms were great for what we paid - going rate is twice that and I would have felt a little gouged for that amount. Our only complaint was the bathroom - which was new and clean but adequate only for one person who didn't need counter space. For two of us, it was quite crowded. The shower was floor level and the water poured out into the main floor. My husband had trouble handling the European type hand held shower. He suggested I put down the toilet seat for counter space.

A bad point was that we waited over an hour at the airport to get the shuttle to the hotel and we could not, because the shuttle just didn't show up. So we had to get a cab. As for the location, it is very close to the airport. Other than that, I firmly and repeatedly recommend this hotel.

I'm a great tipper and have pictures from previous trips to prove it - when you leave a good tip sometimes the housekeeper makes interesting decoration out of the hand towels and beddings.

We stayed here for two nights prior to taking a cruise from Port of Miami and for one night after our cruise ended. Upon arriving in Miami, we took their shuttle from the terminal to the hotel. The shuttles runs every half an hour on the hour. When you get outside, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to call the hotel to figure out when the next one will come along. There are tons of airport hotels in Miami, and more than one Best Western, so keep a sharp eye out for the van. When we arrived at the hotel, we were checked in very quickly. The lobby area is a bit small and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much for it to get full. The check-in staff was very polite and professional as were all of the staff members that we encountered. Our room was outstanding. It was brand new! The room was spotless and the beds very comfortable. The flat screen television was a nice touch. The room was a nice size and the bathroom large and very clean. The rooms have climate control and it cooled down or warmed up pretty quickly. The hotel has done away with its complimentary breakfast. However, if you had booked your room when it was still offered, as we did, you still got it. If not, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to pay for it. The breakfast was buffet style and served in the lobby restaurant with excellent omelets made to order. There was also bacon and sausage as well as danish, breads and cereals. Service was decent but sometimes it took servers a little while to refill coffee cups or to return with requested items. They seemed to be a bit understaffed but they did their best. The restaurant also had a bar and was open for lunch and dinner. It seemed to be doing a rather good business. The hotel is in a very Latino part of the city and is perfectly safe. There are not a whole lot of restaurants but there was a 24 hour IHOP a few blocks away. A quick taxi ride can take you to many good places to eat. The front desk had many good recommendations. We used the workout room but the weather was a bit cold for us to use the pool. The pool is of decent size and is almost out on the street! However, it is surrounded by shrubs and bushes that conceal it from view. It was clean and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too bad that the water was too cold for swimming. One of the two elevators here broke down on the second night. This caused issues as it took a lot longer for guests to get up and down. The situation was even more complicated in the morning as it was still broken. It was a cruise ship sailing day and guests were having a hard time getting an elevator with all of their luggage to the lobby. We noticed this and got there early. If you are going on a cruise, the hotel can arrange transportation to the port for $10 a person. That was a good deal. You can also make arrangements to be taken back to the hotel if you are staying there after your cruise as we did. It was quite busy on sailing day but the people in charge of the vans and buses knew what they were doing and it everything well organized. If you are taking their shuttle to the airport after checking out, give yourself extra time to get to the airport. We arrived for the 5:00 a.m. shuttle with 15 minutes to spare to find it already full. There were other people in the same predicament who also had early flights. The staff on duty called taxis but given the time of the day, it was not easy to get many. Luckily, the shuttle van returned quickly and we were able to get to the airport in time. We saw a bus that the hotel owns in the parking lot but for some reason it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being used for the airport trips and seemed to be reserved for the port shuttles. The driver was a bit miffed about that himself. Overall, a nice stay prior and after our cruise. Recommended.

But after a great night's sleep (yes, the bed and pillows are terrific), we went downstairs for the buffet. We had to wait a bit to be seated, not because the place was busy. There was no signage about waiting to be seated or seating yourself. When someone finally appeared, he was flustered. When we sat down, the waiter did not ask if we wanted to see a menu or anything about the buffet. He also failed to ask if we wanted coffee or juice. The waitress who was supposed to working the room, wasn't. The table next to us was dirty, I had to bring it her attention. While waiting for coffee and juice, which was brought to me and not my husband, even though we asked it for each of us, the loud, booming voice of the person working the omelet station filled the room. He was talking non-stop to a fellow, even while making an omelet for a guest. The other fellow left after ten minutes. Although the man was a talker, he does make a mean omelet. The rest of the stay was fine except at checkout time. This is when the unprofessionalism of the staff really showed. At checkout, my husband read over the bill. We were charged for two meals and drinks at the bar. The bar staff couldn't be bothered to check if the signature matched the room number, it didn't. When we brought it to the attention of the counterperson, she asked to see our invoice, which we didn't have because we didn't eat at the bar at any time. It was then that another guest appeared and the phone rang at the same time. The counterperson reached for the phone. My husband and myself are customer service people and realize that the customer in front of you is what you should be focusing on. The counterperson didn't get the memo. My husband had to ask her to not answer the phone or the other guest and take of our situation first. She was very, very flustered. It was then that a manager appeared from the back and removed the charges from our bill. During all the action, I saw the waiter walking around the lobby looking for a guest who didn't sign his bill.

We walked into the room and loved the color scheme and decor. Nice size. Had everything we needed and more! Other than a couple small stains, it seemed extremely clean. Their pillows and pillow-top mattress were to die for! For the most part, the room was quiet. Never once did I hear anything coming from the rooms next to or above me, and I heard little street noise (though we did get there late) but I was awoken at 1:30 in the morning by a motorcycle idling in the parking lot for several minutes. Certainly not the fault of the hotel, because I know motorcycles can be loud. I wasn't coherent enough to fully figure out just how loud it truly was, but I don't feel that, being on the 5th floor with the window closed, it shouldn't be loud enough in the room to be awoken by. Also, all they have covering the windows is a sheer white curtain - no black out curtains, so depending on which side of the hotel your room is on (one side seemed to be facing a more residential/less busy/less lighted area), it likely will not get very dark. I can live with a motorcycle waking me up, because I know that's a one-time thing that can happen at any hotel, and I can also live with not having black out curtains, so my only real complaint was the service, which to me is the most important part of any experience. Check-in and check-out were slow, and while not necessarily unfriendly, definitely was not at all warm or friendly in person, or when I spoke with them on the phone. I was fully prepared to give a 4 star rating (3 for the service and 4 for everything else) before I filled out my online survey for the property, which was largely positive. I mentioned in that survey the same thing I mentioned here - that I was not impressed with the service, and the response I received back was a template email that apologized for not exceeding my expectations.

Close to Miami International Airport with free shuttle service provided. Restaurant on property. Friendly staff. Cons: Other than the airport, the hotel is not close to good shopping or dining. Service, while friendly, is inconsistent and lengthy at best. Airport shuttle, though free, may be non-existent unless you are prepared to wait 1+ hours. When the Best Western (BW) Hotels started to segregate their properties by class, I wondered how this would translate in the real world. Essentially, a BW Premier property is equivalent to the newly refurbished Holiday Inn properties or Hilton Garden Inns. If you go with this comparison in mind, it will help set your expectation level. The BW Miami Int'l Airport Hotel is a fairly new property that is still, painfully, working out all the kinks. On the positive side, it is lovely and spacious. In other words, it still has the \"new car smell,\" if you know what I mean. Every room has a large LCD flatscreen T.V., refrigerator, microwave, room safe, etc. Now, you may be thinking that every BW has this stuff, so what? You're right in one sense. Essentially all the BW hotels do have these things, but the difference is in the quality of these amenities. Towels and sheets are more premium, as well as the appliances. Also, more thought has been put into the interior design of the place, so it feels modern and more upscale. This property has a full service restaurant that you wouldn't find at Plus or regular BW properties. Having said all that, there are issues. First, the shuttle service is inconsistent. The first time I stayed at this property, the shuttle picked me up within 20 minutes, and there was friendly service from beginning to end. The second time, the shuttle never came. I called 3 different times to advise the staff where I was at MIA airport to no avail. I wound up taking a cab. Later that night, I ran into another patron who admitted he waited for an hour before throwing in the towel and hiring a cab. Second, the location of the hotel means that food options will be very limited. As another reviewer noted, there aren't a lot of restaurants nearby other than fast food options. This means you may be tempted to try the in house restaurant. Save yourself the headache and don't do it. They are still working on major issues. My first experience was to order room service from the restaurant, and it arrived mostly in to-go containers, and lukewarm with some parts of the meal still being cold as if it had been previously frozen. The second time I decided to eat at the restaurant hoping to improve my chances of a decent meal. No such luck. The restaurant was so swamped with guests and lacking waitstaff that I felt as though I were in a losing game of \"Diner Dash.\" While I truly wish I could give this property more stars, the truth is that the price point is competing with Holiday Inns and BW isn't on the winning side. For the same price, you get consistency and quality of service. Maybe in 12 months time, the BW Premier will finally be worthy of its name. Until then, for the price, look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barrie, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent BW hotel.

She immediately assigned me to a room on the seventh floor and gave me my room key. The customer service coupled with the modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor was what I expected when I initially made my reservations with Best Western Premier Miami International Airport Hotel & Suites. After a long flight from Los Angeles, I was ready to settle in. Upon entering my room, I immediately noticed an odor of mildew. Upon further inspection I realized the smell was coming from the air conditioning unit. Relaxing in my room was going to take longer than I anticipated. I gathered my belongings and went back down to the front desk. Leo assisted me this time. He was very professional and apologized for my inconvenience. He promptly assigned me to another room. I took my luggage to a new room and there was no mildew smell coming from the air conditioning unit. Unfortunately the carpet smelled musty. This is where my disappointment begins. After shuttling my luggage to two rooms at Best Western Premier Miami International Airport Hotel & Suites, I still had not found a room where I could rest comfortably. Once again Leo courteously assigned me to another room, 524. Although, the design of this room and the two others I was in earlier, were upscale, the stale motel smell soured me on this hotel. This was my third room and frankly, I was tired, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for another room. The room was extremely comfortable, however. I especially enjoyed the bed. It was plush and difficult to leave in the morning. The next morning I showered, only to find that the tub drained rather slowly. It took the water so long to drain that I had to turn the water off and on throughout my shower. I alerted the front desk and they immediately notified maintenance. The problem was corrected by the end of the day. The complimentary breakfast is better at the $70 a night Best Westerns. The orange juice tasted as flavorful as orange colored water. The fruit wasn't sweet, but I guess you can't blame them for that. The staff was very cordial and even made a waffle for me. I expected a waffle like I've had many times before, instead I get this undercooked, and super sweet waffle. I was so disgusted I left the restaurant.

The rooms were large, comfortable and well-equipped - except that non-dairy creamer powder was supplied with the coffee (yuk).

The shuttle runs every 30 mins, you don't have to phone for it, you just stand on the kerb and peer at all the minibuses going past (great fun at night when all you can see is the headlights coming towards you). The last shuttle is 11:30 pm (currently). Of course, if you go into the airport to look for information or a phone, you risk missing your shuttle and waiting another 30 mins. My advice would be, stay at a hotel a bit further away where you phone for the shuttle from the free phone inside the airport. Or, go to the kerb and phone the airport from your mobile to check if the shuttle is running. Also, make sure you have the correct airport Best Western - check the address!

She says, the only way to charge for the breakfast is to the room. I go back to the front desk and he apologizes and says that they just switched to a new system and gives me 2 cards with our registration information. I hand the hostess the cards and we get seated. Now the waiter asks us which room we're in and again, we tell him, we're waiting to check-in and we gave the hostess our registration information. There's 4 choices to choose from, continental buffet, continental, american, and I forget the last one. We order the non-buffet breakfasts and he tells us to get our choices from the buffet which is organized awkwardly. When we're ready to leave the waiter asks us do we want the breakfast charged to our room or pay now. We're like WTH, we were told we can't pay here. He says, no we can pay now. Ugh! He disappears for 10-15 minutes with my credit card. We're thinking, did he go shopping? But we see him at the bar probably trying to figure out how to charge the card. We tried to eat slowly but my friend didn't have much of an appetite so I go back to the front desk and ask him can we maybe upgrade the room to something that is ready. His supervisor is now there and she says sure and then while they were looking at the screen, she asks, do you have to have 2 beds? I'm like no, as long as it's a king or queen, 1 is fine. She tells the clerk, just give them the king, it's the same price. I'm again like WTH! He saw and heard my friend was feeling sick, he couldn't suggest that option? The room is beautiful. Fully loaded and really clean and modern. It even had a stainless steel microwave. The bathroom was just as nice with granite counters and good lighting in the shower with recessed lights overhead. I hate when hotel showers have that thick opaque curtain and the only lighting is in the vanity so inside the shower, it's so dark. The air-conditioner was quiet and efficient, the bed super comfy. The only thing wrong with the room was instead of shampoo and conditioner, there were 2 conditioners so when we showered, we had to use soap to shampoo our hair.

The 3rd room as soon as I walked in, I ducked down to see garbage under the couch again so i walked out to look no further and requested another room. The 5% fluent employee going up and down with us from front desk to room from front desk to room can't say more then \"WOW THIS NO CLEAN\". The 4th room once again has garbage under the couch this time pennies/nickels/dimes and candy wrappers and under the chair cushion there is a handful of bread crumbs and chewed pieces of salami which hasn't been vacuumed up probably in a long time.

Parking is miniscule but we managed to find spaces all the time. The hotel staff is extremely professional and friendly which makes it a plus! The staff took care of any and all issues we had concerning our stay there and also helped with local addresses and suggestions/directions with excellent results. Day and Night staff were all helpful. They all speak to you when you arrive and greet you goodbye. The Kitchen server staff during the breakfast hours were so unexpectedly helpful when they informed me in a busy and sincere rush that there will be more eggs coming soon. I didn't even ask, but appreciated it very much. There was lots of a genuine feeling care of atmosphere here.

I have three little kids including an infant. Based on the Star rating and location, we checked into Best Western Premier Miami International Airport Hotel & Suites which is newly built 4-Star hotel. Around midnight, as i was adjusting my 6 month olds sheet, i saw a bed bug right under her sheet. Also found a huge one running on the headboard. My kids were in deep sleep and as such they have nightmares about bugs i didn't want to wake them up and scare them. Lost my sleep and was constantly pulling the sheets to check for Bed Bugs. I caught one of the Bed Bugs to show it to the Hotel front desk staff and as evidence (You wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe its still alive with no food in the plastic bag). Also, took a video of the bug that was running around the bed. Next morning, i made a compliant to the front desk Manager; he refunded the money for the room with no questions asked. I wonder if they're already aware of this issue. I also booked another room for my parents. As they are old and really tired after walking around the downtown area, they never checked for Bed Bugs in their room but I found some in their room as well. If i could find couple in my room, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the whole floor is infested.

I booked this hotel based on its location, modern decor, free parking, and most importantly, good reviews, and came out very disappointed. For a family of 4, we booked a suite (instead of a regular 2-Queen bed room) hoping there's at least a tiny bit of privacy as there is usually a partitioned \"bedroom\" in \"suites\" - but it turns out the \"suite\" in this hotel is just a slightly elongated room with the King bed \"partitioned\" by a ONE foot long frosted glass pane that blocks view of the pillows from the sofabed... NOT a \"suite\" as all. We arrived early at noon and there was a VERY long line of people checking out, with only one counter person working, however, the other side of the counter (not yet staffed) has a sign that says \"check in\" so we lined up there (behind another couple) to wait for a staff person. When that staff person finally arrived 20 minutes later (the check-out line up had barely moved), she rudely told us to get back in line. We said we are checking in and everyone else in the lobby was checking out, and she just said, \"get in line\". Well, I thought it was rude. I mean, why bother putting a sign up if both counters are intended to serve one general line up? At least they gave us our room early, and we stayed in there till about 3 pm as my kids take a nap, which might explain my next mishap. We passed by the counter on our way out for dinner, and as we had missed the regular housekeeping hours, i just simply requested the front desk to please get someone to empty our trashcans (full from my kids eating snacks and opening packages in the room). They acknowledged us but when we returned, it was NOT done. We shrugged and readied ourselves for bedtime... only to notice that the sofabed had NO bedding. No extra pillows no sheets and for the 4 of us (we paid for 4 people at reservation) we only got 3 pillows and 2 bath towels. It was 10 pm so we called down to front desk, and he said there was NOTHING that could be done. So i said... how are we supposed to sleep... on the dirty uncovered sofabed mattress? I would not relent, and only then that the front desk guy came up with one thin flat sheet and told us that's all he could find. I asked if he could put it onto the bed for us and he said NO! So there I was, exhausted from a long day and making the bed myself in a hotel.... and out of the corner of my eye we saw a pair of underwear by the armchair that definitely did not belong to us! The next day, I told the daytime front desk people about the sofa bedding fiasco and the pair of DIRTY UNDERWEAR found in our room, she made an \"ew\" face and wrote it down on paper, but there's nothing after... no apologies no nothing. In the 2nd evening after we parked, I noticed the other cars had parking placards and we were never asked if we needed one, so i went up to the front counter (same rude man from the bedding fiasco) and he *very* impatiently said, \"oh well it's not like i have time to tow you\" and grumpily wrote up a placard.... Decor is modern, breakfast buffet was VERY crowded on the Monday morning but was great on Tuesday, and free parking was a plus. The room has a microwave and an empty bar fridge which helped, but no hot water kettle (only a coffee maker). The furniture is FULL of sharp edges and corners (more than usual) perhaps due to its modern decor so it's not too toddler-friendly.... The location was good (minutes to car rental return at MIA airport with lots of gas stations along the way, 15 minutes to midtown, 20-25 minutes to Coral Gables and 35 minutes to Zoo Miami) BUT all that aside, the dirty underwear and bedding fiasco had really scared me.

It was incredible... I don't see rooms like that in a 5 star hotel. I need to check the Best Western site to see if this is their attempt to compete with some of the \"Hilton's\" of the world. Regardless, it was a great hotel room. The service was great as well, since several of the folks in line were agitated flyers that were stuck in Miami. For whatever reason they only had one gentleman at the front desk, and he patiently worked his way though the line. My only issue was I didn't feel like you had a lot to walk to around the hotel.

The place has potential (outdoor pool, free business centre computers, good exercise room, close to airport) and I can understand the growing pains for a new hotel with new staff however I stay at a hotel to get rest and the rooms allow far too much noise (even just normal conversations) from adjoining rooms and hallways.

My only complaint is that Breakfast ends early (6-9am), would be nice if breakfast was available for an hour longer. Also, the hotel should consider having more than one person at the Front Desk more often to decrease longer than average waits.

In fact, the people that I talked to were there waiting for a flight or for a cruise. The breakfast was okay, except for the fact that in some periods the restaurant is completely full. The only thing that I have to complain about is the front desk. As a matter of fact, as the international flights arrive early morning, people go to the hotel expecting an early check in. The hotel has a good policy. They allow early check in as soon as they have rooms available. But, unfortunately, instead of putting the guests on a queue or write down who arrived first, they call the people in a mysterious way. It seemed to me that who keeps insisting with the front desk people is the first to be accommodated, what frankly it is the end of the world.

Although police took info and checked all 3 rooms, for the hotel this means nothing. We will not be reimbursed at all,since they claim not to be liable for items left in the rooms.

My pet peeve, if you've read my previous posts, is not having access to the TV so we can plug Playstations or video players in. Not so with this place! You have complete control over the latest technology 42\" LCD TV and if you want to watch the premium channels, they are all there, as well. An excellent breakfast, as well as free internet and free parking are included, so no \"plus, plus, plus\" as in some of the major chains. No hidden charges this way, so no surprises at check-out.

I found this hotel on Orbitz, and we were thoroughly pleased. This is a relatively new hotel, and the accommodations were excellent. We took the free shuttle from the airport. Upon arriving, the front desk staff was welcoming and attentive. The rooms were clean, and the beds were extremely comfortable - the linens were top notch. We were skeptical about dinner at the hotel but didn't feel like taking a cab to a restaurant. Boy, were we happy with our decision! Compared to the cruise we had just completed, the food was definitely on par. I had the fillet and my husband had chicken parmesan. Both excellent choices. We were told the chef, Giraldo, was very good, and this proved be true. He visited our table and seemed very pleased that we were enjoying our dinner. Jose C. was a great bartender (full bar), server, and conversationalist. All in all the experience was great with one hotel drawback. We tried using the Exit to reach the first floor and found the Emergency Exit on the first floor locked on the inside. We explored other emergency routes and found none. The elevators seemed to be the only way down to the first floor. This made us extremely nervous. We mentioned this to the staff who said other guests had pointed this out too. We decided in case of fire, we'd head to the second floor, and jump out the window into the pool. Something to consider.

Coffee maker, microwave and iron was also provided. Had no trouble at all sleeping,the bed was comfortable and there was no noise at all from the road. Parking was apparently free, we did not take advantage of it since we arrived late at night (took the shuttle, was difficult to find - the airport in Miami could learn from other airports where they have designated pick-up points for each and every hotel and a map showing where these are) and picked up the rental car in the morning. The breakfast at the hotel was included in the price and it was decent. There was a selection of both hot and cold food.
