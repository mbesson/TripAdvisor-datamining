{"Reviews": [{"Content": "GREAT location if you're into WEST Berlin!!! Me and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel for 5 weekdays, and I must admit, the location is great... IF you are into the snobbish West Berlin city centre. The biggest mall of Europe, the KaDeWe, is located only a few blocks away, and the subway station is just outside the hotel! You have a grocery store, drugstore, Dunkin' Donuts, music-stores, money exchange, doctors office, McDonalds, Burger King, pizza places, great restaurants, the main railroad station in Berlin and plenty of other useful and great things just outside the hotel. So, again, the location is GREAT! Having that said, the hotel is very average. The rooms were pretty cheap, though. Less than $100 USD a night. What you get is: decent large rooms with high ceilings (the bulding is like over a 100 years old!), smallish bathrooms with insanely small bathtubs (I could barely fit my feet in it!), minibar, tv (I'll get back to the pay-tv part!), windows with a nice view of the city centre. The doors to the rooms are double, and old. They seem weird at first, but they do work. I didn't feel completely safe behind those old doors, though. But they have a 24-hour reception and video surveillance, so.... My biggest (and only real) complaint during my stay at this hotel was that pay-tv automatically started charging after 2 minutes of free viewing. The thing is.. There was no timer that said 10...9...8...7.... 2...1.. Ca-CHING! - So I ended up getting a $80 USD bill upon checkout, for something I really didn't watch. I only checked out a few minutes of the movie channel. I was never told (not until upon checkout) that the free part only lasted for 2 minutes. This is not the way to do it, dear Germans. Anyway. Staff was helpful and nice. There were some extremely attractive women working at the hotel, and some very kind male staff. I'd reccommend this hotel to anyone who would like to stay as central as you can stay in West Berlin, in an average-quality room. If you are YOUNG though (like we are...) you would be even better off staying in the East part of Berlin. The atmosphere is MUCH better in those parts! Less strics, less stressful.. More warm and cozy, and the restaurants are much more urban and fun in the East as well! All in all, we had a great trip, and a pleasant stay is Hotel Fruehling am Zoon in West Berlin!", "Date": "May 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR927298670", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ThomasWH"}, {"Content": "Be careful of the breakfast charge The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Just be careful of the breakfast charge. When we checked in the receptionist just told us breakfast was served in the room next door. So we figured it came with the room. (As does breakfast at most hotels in Germany) At the end of the stay we found out it was 13Euro per person, per day for breakfast. So we had to shell out an extra 78 Euro.Ouch! Definitely not an expense we were expecting. Other than that the rooms are ok.

She saw that we had our map out and she stated, I don't speak very good English, but where are you trying to go? We told her the hotel name and she gave us a short cut. We thanked her and walked to the hotel.The hotel is in a great location. I actually loved the area. The area was very clean, the people frinedly, plenty to see and do, etc.We were shocked to see that there were several steps to walk up before getting into the hotel. (The only downfall) We checked in and had no problems. They spoke great English and directed us to our room.We took the elevator up and got to our room. The entrance to the room is very interesting. First you have to open up two swinging doors to get into the main door. We had three beds in our room. The room was fairly large and was very clean.The bathroom was basic. It had a hairdryer, personal products, etc. It was very clean.If I were to go to Berlin again, I would stay at the Comfort Hotel Fruehling am Zoo.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR276505396", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Single rooms are uncomfortable prison cells The only good thing about that hotel is the location, directly at the entrance of K-Damm Subway-station.
