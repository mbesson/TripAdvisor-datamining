We were not expecting a great deal but the quality of the room was extremely disappointing. The lobby was very modern and funky looking but we got a shock on arrival into our room. It was the smallest room we had ever stayed in and certainly not 4 star standard! There was barely enough room to close the door and walk in without stumbling into the bed. The room was extremely dark and there was one small window which overlooked 4 grey walls and a large drop. The bathroom was small and every single one of the rails for towels, etc was broken and would fall off the wall once touched. The shower was poor as the water pressure was very weak. Then there was the temperature problem! On our first night, we turned on the air conditioning and it appeared to be working fine. However, we woke up early the next morning to an incredible heat which made us both feel very ill. We asked reception if there was a problem and they said that the air conditioning was experiencing problems and was blowing out hot air instead of cool air. The staff were unapologetic over this issue and simply advised us to turn off the air con even though the heat in the room would be excessive without it. We were eventually transferred to another room but the problem with the air con remained and the room was still unbareably hot without any air conditioning. This along with the poor standard of the room, made us want to stay away from the hotel as much as possible. The location of the hotel is excellent but that is not enough to earn it's 4 star rating. We were very disappointed with our stay and would certainly not be staying here again.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel/location\u201d", "Author": "Cindy P Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126755436", "Content": "Very good/clean hotel.

THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN !!\u201d", "Author": "William M", "ReviewID": "UR124288080", "Content": "Myself & my fiance booked into this hotel, to enjoy a city break in Barcelona to celebrate his birthday. Can I just start by saying that we are normal working folk, we usually stay in 3/4 star hotels. We do not expect platinum service, we just expect a clean and pleasant stay. On arrival we were pleased with the presentation of the reception (very modern & jazzy). The receptionist appeared very friendly & spoke great English. When we were checking in, there was a current guest complaining that his room was too cold & that he had been promised the heating would be fixed the day before. This elderly man was then given a blanket. The lift upto the room was a scary ride, after waiting a good few minutes for it to arrive, it was very out-dated & unsafe looking & both myself & my partner got a mini electric shock inside (this continued to happen everytime we were inside it). Other guests had obviously clicked on to this, as everyone else seemed to always use the stairs. The corridor was dirty & hostel like. When we opened the room (305) door the bed was instantly there, the most compact room I have ever been in! The door basically touches the bed on opening. The room was really really dark, the lighting was poor & the two windows were covered by two blinds each, that were broke & unable to be rolled up! The view looked on to an immediate void space between 4 brick walls. Everything in the room seemed grubby, broken & unclean. The bed had one thin grey/white sheet over it. The TV had no signal. The 'minibar' with 3 bottles of water in it was warm. The towel rail was hanging off. The towels were rock hard. Sockets were actually hanging off the wall! But the most unbearable of all.. was the ice cold temperature!! I phoned down to reception & said the instructions for the safe had been cut in half & the room was cold. He just said read the instructions & hung up. We went down to reception & the receptionist who had previously spoke perfect English, was now really struggling to understand us?! We were finally told that the maintenance man would fix it while we were out for dinner. We returned to the hotel just after midnight. We were told \"I dont know, I think so, take a blanket\" when asked if the heating had been fixed. We refused the blanket & reluctantly returned to the room to check, and surprisingly it hadn't been fixed & it appeared that no one had been in our room at all. I again phoned the reception to be told that I was to try turning the heating off & on a few times. This did not work. Then I was told to close the windows... The windows were painted shut!!! We gathered our stuff & headed to reception. We were given the key to room 705, this room was worse than the previous & the heating also never worked!!! I refused to stay a minute longer in that pit! I was reluctantly offered a refund! Although the \u00a3180.18 has left my account, it has still not been refunded! My bank are now disputing this! Overall this hotel does not deserve 1 star!! It was unsafe, unclean, cold & the staff were selective in their service! This is the first review I have ever left, but I just want to warn people off! We had to walk around at 1am in search of a new hotel. We paid \u00a320 more for an actual 4 star hotel called Hoteles Barcelona Centre... It was luxury!!

Breakfast gives a nice range of pastries, two cereals and various other meats. This is perfect to get the day started. It is a little over priced however we had a cheap rate that included breakfast. The hotel is close to the metro stop Juaime which is where all the really nice and traditional restaurants are. A hidden gem at that. I would have no problem recommending this hotel.

It was in between two metro stops that were easy to get to. As an aside, definitely use Barcelona's EXCELLENT subway system to get around the city. The hotel is right across the street from the cathedral and about a half mile from Las Ramblas. We either walked from our hotel or caught the subway everywhere.

Actually - after my fianc\u00e9 had been stolen his ID on the street after he checked out of the hotel, he returned there (as it wasnt far from the hotel) to sort out all the phonecalls in a quiet environment. They printed out all what he needed, advised him where to go to the police, etc. Although at some point the reception got very busy and there was always just one receptionist, we never found them unfriendly or rude. 2/ not enough choice at the breakfast - cornflakes, fruits, meat, chicken, eggs, sausages, bacon, croissants, muffins, cheese. The only thing I missed was the fresh vegetable but definitely - the choice is huge. 3/ small rooms and a bad view - our room was spacious and had a good view. But I suppose, as the hotel is attached between 2 buildings, some of the rooms might have a bad view. Our room also had a terrace - amazing and relaxing to sit there in the afternoon. The noise is there as Via Laietana is the main street but the room was totally quiet once we closed the terrace door (and also not too noisy when sitting on the terrace). 4/ slow lifts - this is what I agree with but we never waited longer than couple of minutes. Generally I must say we liked the hotel a lot. Our room was cleaned every day, they changed our sheets and towels daily, too (I actually missed the sign \"if you want us to change your towels today, leave them in the bath tub\" to be friendlier to our environment).

Of course we requested for a normal room with a normal bathroom utilities. We ended up in a room being very narrow very dirty and with most ground tiles to be broken. We requested for another change and we ended at room with a window covered by a sticky white paper for not allowing the view to other people\u2019s balconies.

We went down stairs and asked for the hotel personnel to come in to the room and verify the noise, as he did, in order to inform directly the hotel management of the situation.

We had a room with dripping faucets, a tv that didn't work, mattresses that had springs coming through, scratchy sheets, hard/flat pillows and absolutely no privacy. We felt like we were in a hostel.

The bathroom floor was swept clean but had dried \"spots\" on the floor so it obviously wasn't washed - I kept my slippers on the entire time. Our bed was barely made the next day, just sheets thrown over and by the next morning my husband was sleeping in his twin bed on a bare mattress. We were laughing at how sad it actually was.

The room had a mini fridge which had a couple of beers, water and soft drinks which were free.The breakfast was plentiful with lots of variety and the staff were friendly and helpful.The hotel is in a great location and dont miss a trip to the cathedral oppositeas it is a wonderful building. The only downside we found was that as we were on the main street it was quite noisy but we bought ear plugs and we were fine.

The area the hotel is located in is very good for exploring Barcelona. Only a 5-10 minute walk from Las Ramblas, 15 mins from the port, etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean with quite nice decor and modern. Breakfast was very good too. Now for the negative. We were on the first floor (we had two rooms) at the front of the hotel. The noise from the Irish bar below went on until 3.00am. The air conditioning in the rooms didn't work other than to make the room hotter. Many other guests on our floor had the same problem. If you opened the windows the noise from the main road outside was unbearable. There is no bar and no restaurant, although they do have a gym which is very small. The hotel is categorised as 4 star and we paid over \u00a3100 per night for each of our two rooms.

Good points: The room was absolutely immaculate and cleaned every day The minibar was free! Including beer and wine We got free toiletries etc The location - about 5 min walk to the harbour, 10 min to La Rambla etc and a tourist bus stop right outside the front door Bad points: The room was tiny! This was fine for me and my boyfriend, but would have been extremely cramped if we'd been overweight! The bed was rather small as well. The noise! Our window faced into a courtyard towards residential apartments - we could other people and also the deafening noise of traffic from the main road The air-con didn't work. Thankfully this wasn't too much of an issue due to it being winter! The restaurant - we didn't actually manage to find it until our last day there! Renovation work - there was dust and dirt in reception area and the lift. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to those wanting budget-style accomodation. You really couldn't beat the location.

So consequently we didn't bother. The hotel has nothing to offer, there is obviously building work going on as there were bags of cement left lying around, holes in walls and builders hand prints on just about every wall but even when this is complete I fail to see how the hotel will be much improved.
