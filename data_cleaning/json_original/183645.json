For a few days we wanted the convenience of a fully-outfitted suite complete with kitchen and laundry. We occupied a one bedroom king suite on the 20th floor. It came complete with four burner range, frost free refrigerator, a 24\" dishwasher, microwave, and even a combination washer/condensing (ventless) dryer. Our suite had pots and pans, dishes, glasses, even things like measuring cups, knives, a strainer, potholders and a cutting board. They even supplied detergent for the dishwasher. The suite itself is nothing special furnishings wise, it was clean, the bath had minimal amenities and the furnishings were fairly ordinary. For us the luxury was in having a suite that we could cook and live in as though it were an apartment. As much as I enjoy eating out, after more than two weeks in hotel rooms we were delighted to be able to go the supermarket nearby and buy groceries that we could prepare ourselves. The view from all the windows and balcony was spectacular. We faced towards False Creek/English Bay and had a panoramic view of the entire area, including the residential building we were waiting to move into. A picture from the balcony is attached. We could watch freighters come and go, small pleasure craft navigating the bay, and even at night the view is magnificent because all the ships are lit up then. The suite included a washer/dryer combination unit. It sounds nifty but in reality it takes 5 hours or so to do one small load of laundry, most of that time being the drying cycle. It doesn't work like hot air dryers but instead it dehumidifies the clothes. They do come out warm and dry but rather more wrinkled than from a conventional dryer. We did two loads a day while we were there and by the time we checked out to take possession of our new home we left with suitcases full of clean clothing. We were offered a very good rate, some $40/night off the published rack rate but that saving was offset some by the fairly steep $18.25 daily parking rate. They told us it was $15 per day but on the bill was added a $3.25 parking tax, whatever that is. However it is in a secured underground lot. I had tremendous difficulty with the Internet wi-fi connection, with frustrating disconnections. My partner had less trouble but his computer is newer and I suspect has a better wi-fi receiver than mine. Nevertheless I had more trouble at this hotel than any of the others we'd recently stayed in en route to Vancouver. If you are considering a longer stay in the West End The Sandman Suites is a good choice. There are any number of hotels in the area with more posh amenities but very few that give you the luxury of living in what is essentially a completely outfitted one bedroom apartment.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cEn-Suite 1BR with pull-out Sofa Bed is a gem\u201d", "Author": "Jos760", "ReviewID": "UR122787970", "Content": "My best friend and I are looking for an en-suite 1BR hotel where one who snores would sleep in the bedroom and the one who doesn't would sleep on a pull-out bed. We couldn't afford separate rooms and so we googled around to find an en-suite BR just like Embassy Suites. Our priceline.com search populated this result and we called their local number and verified that all their rooms are en-suite BR with pull-out sofa bed on the living room. The rooms are exactly as they were in the pictures: up to date and clean. There is a kitchen complete with dishwasher, microwave, oven, washer-dryer combo unit, and pressing iron. There are even dishwashing liquid, utensils, and chinas provided. Even though I get to sleep in the pull-out sofa bed, there is a separate closet by the washer-dryer for me to store luggage and equipment, a surprise but a nice thought. The location is perfect. We didn't realize it's on the \"rainbow\" stretch of Davie Street, and that was perfectly fine but may be bothering for some bigots (we're strait and only in town for Whistler and Grouse skiing). There were good food around the corner: we ate Indian, Arabic, Mediterranean, Chinese and Filipino food. Pacific Place mall and Canada Place is a mile or a little more from this location but given the food we eat is considered an exercise. Parking is not free but not a rip-off either. However, because of lofty tax, it could cost you a lot as we drove from Seattle, crossed the border into Canada and stayed here for our ski vacation in Whistler, Grouse Mountain and side trip to Victoria and around Vancouver.

The living space was comfortable, but the bedroom was WAY too cramped for the King bed in it. Also, the bedding is in desperate need of replacement, with old coverlets and fleece comforters that most hotels have not used since the 90s. Additionally the mattress itself is in need of replacement. The cleanliness was fine with the exception of the mattress pad. It was stained so badly (and looked fairly fresh) that it was clearly visible through the linens. Revolting? Yes.

It's a real mixed bag, so here are the pros and cons - Pros - great location, right near a 24 hour supermarket/pharmacy and plenty of terrific affordable restaurants. Lovely walk to Stanley Park and the beach. Having a washing machine and kitchen in the room/suit is brilliant too. The reception is also very stylish. Cons - Having seen the stylish reception, the very shabby, old fashioned rooms were a real disappointment (although the white goods were pretty new). The air con is one of those old boxes on the outside wall with a vent, which was practically useless, and the decor would have been old fashioned 15 years ago, with chipped furniture and very tired everything. But the WORST THING about this hotel was the fact that, without telling me, my credit card was charged $400 as a 'hold' when we checked in, and although I was told when we checked out that this would be refunded in 3 days, I ended up having to chase the hotel manager (who was VERY rude on email, saying that all North American hotels did this...well, having just stayed in 5 different hotel chains in America and Canada, the Sandman on Davie was the only one that a) didn't tell me, b) charged so much, and c) didn't automatically release the charge on checkout.) I also chased the hotel chain owner on Facebook, who did reply but didn't follow it up, and did not apologise for the rudeness of his hotel manager. I was finally refunded the money after more than 2 weeks, which is no fun when you're on holiday and need access to YOUR OWN MONEY. So, there are good points about this hotel (basically location and washing machine!), but make sure that you can afford an extra $400 on top of your spending money before you check into this hotel as you may have a fight on your hands to get the hold dropped from your card.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cIf you value sleep - don't stay here\u201d", "Author": "stitchnthyme", "ReviewID": "UR119346722", "Content": "The hotel is located in a very loud, raucous area.

Yep, orange - is the colour that greets you as you enter the lobby of the Sandman. Not what you expect, but it sort of works. The Sandman is a really good option in Vancouver for a few nights. It's a busy hotel and you can see that with the number of people always in and around reception and the lobby. On my visit, only two of the three lifts were in operation which resulted in a few log jams of people coming and going and 3-4 minutes waits up on our level. By the time I checked out, the third lift was back in operation, which helped with this issue massively We were given a room way up on level 22 - which is just superb with fantastic 180 degree views over the bay, and the mountains - and epic sunsets. The room was more of a small apartment style, with seperate bedroom (small). The living area too was quite small with only one sitting chair and not a sofa - so not really that good for two people. I did appreciate the kitchen with stove top, microwave, dishwasher, full size fridge and all the fixings. This apartment would be great for one person, even on a longer term rental - which may be their market as I overheard more than a few people discussing long term rates with reception. The place is clean and fairly modern, though you can tell it is an older building which has been refurbed into it's current spec. Someone suggested it was actually an apartment block that was turned into a hotel. I like the fact there is an ice machine on every other level so you can wander down and fill your ice bucket, or get a cold soft drink from a vending machine. There is a restaurant and cocktail bar downstairs although we didn't avail ourselves of this. A nearby supermarket was perfect for picking up some items to fix in the kitchen - basic breakfast essentials. And there is also a bottle shop (liquor store) right over the road if you want to pick up wines or beers (which you should, to enjoy out on the balcony at sunset!) The location of the hotel is slap bang in the middle of the Davie Street action. This is certainly the 'pink' part of Vancouver so be prepared for a gay vibe around this neighbourhood. It adds to the colour and atmosphere for sure - and you see and experience this in some of the nearby bars and cafes. Some other reviews had suggested this was seedy and their were a few creepy types in the neighbourhood. I didn't find this at all. The place feels quite safe and there are always people out and about. Reception staff were very efficient, super friendly and great for advice on local cafes and eateries. Thanks for the tip on Samurai Sushi - less than a block from the hotel. Wow - best value meal I ate the whole time I was in Vancouver. Massive portions of fresh sushi! Excellent bookshop down the street as well. You can walk to Granville Street easily from here and right into downtown. Can't fault the location, that's for sure. I enjoyed my couple of nights here. Highlights being the view from our room, convenient location, full kitchen scenario and friendly staff. No real downsides - the bathroom was a bit on the small side - but I didn't choose this place because of the bathroom. Free wireless was also appreciated. You can get a bus down the street to the train station (Canada Line) which will take you quickly and efficiently to the airport. It's too far to walk down to the station, unless you have minimal luggage. I actually got a cab down the street as I had a fair bit of luggage - price was about $8 down to the station. And about $3(?) through to the airport.

Kitchen was fridge/freezer, stove, micro, coffee maker. Pots, plates, cups for 4 people in the cupboards. Had washer/dryer in the closet. Worked but took 4.5hrs for a couple of pants to wash/dry. Bed was comfortable. Reasonable pillows and blankets were soft, not scratchy like you sometimes find. AirConditioner is noisy but from the bedroom it was just white noise. Alternative was to open the balcony door and street noise was a little less (16th floor). Free Internet. Not cheap hotel restaurant (Moxies) but why bother with so much nearby. Room was \"04\" and was near elevators. Sitting in living room sounded like someone was constantly rolling their wheeled carry-on up and down the hall but it was the elevators. Not loud, just something you might notice and then could ignore. A nice, suitable, comfortable room in a very ideal location.

I thought it would be full of bars and sex shops. Fortunately for me, Hotels.com gave me a good deal at less than $100 dollars per night so I decided to give it a try. Plus points : (1) the hotel\u2019s amenities: the one bedroom suite has everything on it (dishwasher, washer and dryer, oven, microwave, etc.). Internet (wired or wireless) is free of charge unlike other hotels and the signal was really, really good. (2) neighborhood: You can buy your groceries at a 24 hour store near the hotel or at two of organic shops nearby. You can choose to cook at your room or try out all the restaurants in the neighborhood. There are two Starbucks and Blenz Coffee next door if you just want to chill out. Minus points: elevator. There are three elevators. The one in the middle works fine. But the other two, although it works fine, has a faulty card reader. It usually takes some time for it to clear your card so you tend to spend some time swiping your card so you can punch in your hotel floor. If you are in a hurry, this can be irritable but otherwise, its fine. I hope the management will do something about the card reader of those two elevators. The hotel is in good neighborhood. The nearest train station (Yaletown) is eight blocks down the street. If you are coming from YVR airport, you can take the skytrain from there and it will cost you around $8.25 up to Yaletown-Roadhouse station. You can then take a taxi from the station or walk eight blocks up the street. If you have a big luggage, I suggest you take a taxi (probably cost you below $10) since it\u2019s a little bit on the hilly side. Or you can take a taxi from the airport straight to the hotel. It will cost you around $35 including the customary tip. Location-wise, you will need to walk a minimum of five blocks before you reach any of the sites mentioned in tourist books. Robson street is the nearest at five blocks. The Aquabus ferry station is at the bottom of Davie street so you can also just walk to the end of Davie street and you will end up at the docking station of Aquabus that will take you to Granville Public Market. Or Burrard street, which is one block away from your hotel, you just turn left and walk all the way down that street and you will end up in Canada Place. I suggest you use google maps if you want to know how to get from this hotel to the sites you want to go to. It gives you a pretty accurate walking directions to the places you want to see. Vancouver downtown is a walking city. You can practically see all the tourist sites just using your map. Don\u2019t forget to bring good pair of shoes so you can walk around and see the sights and not worry about blisters.

The rooms are adequately equipped for cooking - although a dustpan and brush would be handy. The towels were changed daily usually, despite our efforts to keep them sometimes.

I was a flight attendant at the time and have stayed at a lot of high-end hotels and a lot of dives. I'm pretty discerning when it comes to customer service and know how hotel guests are supposed to be treated. First off, I will say that although I'm pretty easy to please and don't like to be a bother to hotel staff, my boyfriend is kind of high-maintenance (he's a pilot, so...yeah). LOL! He has allergies, he prefers the suites with hardwood floors and he doesn't like a lot of noise (he's a light sleeper). He is a compulsive room-changer if anything is amiss. Front desk staff were not only tolerant, but they were friendly and accommodating when my boyfriend politely requested room changes - twice - on our last two visits. All staff we encountered were polite, efficient, professional, helpful and informative. Each time we've stayed they've honoured our airline employee corporate rate. During our first stay, we had a room on the 21st floor (2102 or 2103 I believe - harbour view corner suite closest to Davie Street, facing west, same side of the hall as the elevators). We were absolutely wowed by the hardwood floors in the kitchen and living area, the huge balcony, the stunning harbour view, the full kitchen complete with stainless steel appliances, dishes and a washer/dryer, and a queen-sized bed. We had absolutely no problems during our first stay. Yes, the bathroom is small, but are you planning on sleeping in the bathroom? Are you spending the majority of your stay in the bathroom? If so, then you have a bigger problem in life than a hotel room with a small bathroom. LOL! It's roomy enough for one person, a little tight, but I've had rooms in other hotels with smaller bathrooms, and besides, the rest of the hotel room more than made up for it. Being able to do our laundry, make our own breakfast each morning and having a fridge to put goodies in was a wonderful convenience. Parking rates were a little steep, but that's downtown Vancouver, and considering it's secure underground parking, we felt good about having a safe place to park. In all honesty, you don't need a car for most of your stay if you plan on staying at this location, as everything cool in downtown Vancouver is within walking distance. Street noise wasn't that bad at all, quite surprising considering how busy it is in this area. Housekeeping staff were always friendly and nice, and allowed me to take extra shampoo (I have long hair). We kept our laptops and other valuables in our rooms on each stay and felt confident enough in the staff's integrity to leave them in our room when we went out. The wireless internet connection in the hotel is a little janky, cutting out unexpectedly on one of our stays, but most of the time it was alright (we were there to enjoy the city, not the internet, so it wasn't that big of a deal to us). Also, if you plan on making local calls, they charge about $0.99 per call. I think that's about the only thing I didn't like about this hotel - it's a little thing, but when you're paying the standard nightly room rate, it kind of sucks to be nickeled and dimed for local calls (which I think should be free). Most hotels do this, and I think it's a cheap money-grab that tarnishes the experience somewhat. It would be nice to see the Sandman break from the herd in this regard. My boyfriend complained (nicely) about the phone charges, and front desk staff took it off right away without an argument. For those of you wondering about bed bugs - on all three stays, we had absolutely NO bed bug bites, nor were there any sign of bed bugs, and I've never had a single bite at any of Sandman's hotels we've stayed in (we've stayed at the Sandman in Richmond and Revelstoke as well and have never had a problem). The wait for elevators at this location is a slight annoyance during peak check-in and check-out times (or if there are teams staying at the hotel), but most of the time it's not bad at all. You need to use your room key at night to access your floor (a nice security feature, but a pain if you forget or you're not fast enough and end up going for an unwanted ride. LOL!) During our second stay, we were given a corner room - it was either the 12th floor, 13th floor or the 10th floor, I can't remember. The room was a corner suite with a harbour view (same side of the hall as our previous room and elevators, but on the south/alley side of the building). The suite had carpet rather than hardwood, was somewhat smaller than its it's other corner counterpart and had considerably more wind noise than our prior suite. My boyfriend experienced allergy symptoms and we found out this was a floor that allowed pets, so we asked to move. We looked at a corner room (on the north side of the building) a few floors up, which also had carpet (we thought all suites had hardwood like our first suite, but hardwood suites are only on the 21st floor and above, if I'm remembering correctly). They didn't have a harbour view suite above the 21st floor available, so they showed us a room on the 23rd floor opposite the elevator. We were a little skeptical, but the room was beautiful and you couldn't hear the elevator at all, and the view of downtown Vancouver was stunning, so we took it. We experienced no further issues. On our third stay, we were given a room on the 23rd floor (as we requested, as my boyfriend has minimal allergy symptoms in the hardwood suites) with a city view. It wasn't a corner suite, but I find the non-corner suites quite roomy on the city-side (we viewed a non-corner suite on the harbour-view side on a previous stay and though I loved it, my boyfriend prefers the layout of the inner suites on the east-facing city side). Again, staff was tolerant of his apologetic room-moving requests (more tolerant than even me. LOL!) and once we settled into a suite that he was happy with, there were no further issues. I've read some reviews saying that this hotel is in a ghetto location, and I completely disagree. It's in an excellent location, within walking distance of street-level shops and a surprising diversity of restaurants - within a block of the Sandman, there are two indian restaurants (the one on the same side of the road as the Sandman is fantastic), two mexican restaurants, a thai restaurant (delicious soup), three greek restaurants, a burger joint, two chinese restaurants, a Starbucks, and for those of you with more vanilla tastes, a Denny's. Moxie's (the hotel restaurant) is ALWAYS great (the Beef Vindaloo is my favourite, as well as the BBQ pork ribs with garlic mashed potatoes. The burgers are always great, and their eggs benny for breakfast is outstanding). It's within walking distance of lots of cool and eclectic street-level shops, and for those of you who like to party in your hotel rooms and make the lives of everyone around you a sleepless hell, there's a liquor store one block away. There are also two small grocery stores with fresh fruit stands and a Mac's store (chain convenience store). Honestly, if the Sandman ever converted to condos, it would be an ideal location to live. It's just up the hill from the ferry that takes you to Granville Island, it's about a 20 minute walk to Stanley Park and about a 10 minute walk to Robson Street. It couldn't be in a more ideal location in my opinion. It's a wonderful area, diverse, dynamic and buzzing with activity, and it's probably my favourite area of Vancouver. My boyfriend and I travel a lot and have stayed at a vast array of hotels throughout Canada and North America, and I have to say that the Sandman on Davie Street is, by far, one of our favourite hotels to stay in (and we've stayed at Starwood hotels, Marriott hotels - and we prefer Sandman, because the company is big enough to care about quality but isn't so big that they're arrogant and don't care about customers). I recommend rooms on the 21st floor or above (the ones with hardwood in the kitchen and living space) for those people with allergy concerns (or people who just like having a prettier room. LOL!), and I recommend corner rooms on the north corner of the hotel (closest to Davie Street) or central rooms that aren't on the elevator side if you want to minimize wind and elevator noise. As a side note, my boyfriend's sister stayed at the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre during our most recent visit in January 2011, and after leaving their room my boyfriend and I commented that we liked our Sandman room much better than the Sheraton, because of the location and in-room conveniences (and room rates at the Sheraton were double the cost of Sandman rates). If you're looking for a home-away from home with all the conveniences of home (in-suite laundry, a dishwasher, full-sized refrigerator, microwave, full dish set and cutlery, a toaster, a kettle and a coffee maker) in a great location, I highly recommend this hotel. :)", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cIt's all about Davie Street!\u201d", "Author": "MellieEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR115863474", "Content": "3 of us stayed at the Sandman Suites and we had a blast!

You couldn't hear from inside the rooms. - Ice Machine on our floor was VERY loud. TV was distorted (they need to upgrade them), no dish soap in the kitchen... only dishwasher detergent. - I was charged for an extra movie. BE CAREFUL! The remotes are tricky! We accidently \"purchased\" an extra movie. When I brought this up an checkout, the front desk clerk gladly removed 1 day of parking instead which was a better deal. This is a GREAT choice if you have kids and need an affordable central location. It was perfect because we ate meals in the hotel room instead of spending the money in restaurants and saved our money for attractions and souvenirs. If you are considering this hotel and need questions answered, please let me know. We will definitely stay again!

The bus runs on Davie street which is convenient; and Robson street isn't far where there are a lot of apparel stores (& there's a Mall about a mile away).

Sandman definitely isn't the Marriott or Embassy Suites, but it suited me just fine for a trip alone. The hotel staff are OK, some are pretty nice & others act like they are there cause they have to pay their bills (they move pretty slow- but I wasn't in a hurry so I didn't let them stress me- until I needed toilet tissue and it took them 50 minutes to bring it to my room).

The housekeeping service was excellent and fast and very accommodating with when to return to have the room made up.

Davie st is right smack in the middle of the Gay district of a proud Vancouver. Gay, Lesbian, Straight, A-Sexual...go for it, this is definitely a great place to hang out. Vancouver is an amazing city, where the harbour hangs with the parks, and mountains form a post card back drop. In the old days, Kodak would have made a fortune selling you film, its cities like this where you give thanks for digital technology. Sightseeing - a cycle through stanley park is a must - you can walk 10 mins from the hotel and pay about 5 bucks an hour. stop for a local lager in the centre of the park to quench a sweaty thirst. Also take the ferry, more like something you'd see in a child's bath, over to Granville island...the foods not great if eating there, though local produce in the summer market is stunning. Its a small city so you can just walk every where. Eating - sushi is big and can be eaten almost anywhere! Maxims next to the hotel is good fusion food, though avoid the lamb (and you can charge to your room) and Stephos on Davie, well this Greek joint is well worth queuing for. The Sandman Suites on Davie was clearly an older hotel, though they have give it a good lick (of paint) and is in good nick. The lobby is funky and in keeping with the environs, the rooms are spacious and all have a balcony, fridge and washing machine. There is A/C though its pretty noisy. If feeling rough, take advantage of the steam room and pool area, its pretty handy. The location is excellent. There is so much happening on the doorstep, great people watching and all the convenient shops you'd need (drugstore, bakery, starbucks, kevin kebab shop, chinese laundry). Don't be put off by the 25c peepshows across the road. cant imagine you see much for 25c. The service was exceptional, especially from the front office manager Eugene. 5 stars to him. Downsides were very slow lifts (sometimes waiting to descent for 10 mins) and there were never enough staff at check in or out. If you're going for a drive around BC and returning to Vancouver, they'll happily store your excess luggage for no fee. and the internet is free (albeit a little slow) if you have your own laptop.

I would say the room was ideal for 2 adults, if you had more it could get a little close depending how much time you spent there.

The first room we were shown did not have functional heating. When the manager attempted to rectify this a large chunk of piping came away from the wall. We asked to be moved. The second room stank of smoke. The hotel management assured us it was a non-smoking suite, but the stench suggested otherwise. They showed us to a third suite which we accepted out of desperation. It had a toilet unit propped up by folded beeer mats which rocked every time it was used. The french windows did not fully close, leaving us with an icy draft and a lot of noise. We complained and were offered a small discount of a breakfast in the restaurant. Insult added to injury - we sought breakfast elsewhere. On departure we complained again and were told we could claim 15% of our next stay.

The location is spot on for exploring the downtown area on foot and is also very close to most of the major bus lines that will bring you to the attractions in the Greater Vancouver area. Davie Village itself has a lot to offer including some very good restaurants and cafes that are just a step away from the front door of the hotel. The hotel is beginning to look somewhat dated on the outside but inside, the lobby is a modern, welcoming place. Possibly the hotel's strongest point are its staff, who are easily the friendliest, most helpful I've come across in any hotel I've stayed in. We upgraded to a cityview room on arrival (for an extra $30) and would recommend it for the views of the city, particularly at night. Being up on the higher floors probably kept things a little quieter too as Davie would get busy late in the evenings on the weekends. The room allocated to us was on the 22nd floor and was very clean, if a little dated in parts. However, a pretty comfy bed, ample complimentary toiletries and nice, soft towels make up for any other shortcomings (the bathroom is on the small side but not unmanageable). Internet access worked instantly and efficiently and was more than fast enough for everyday emailing and browsing needs. Housekeeping called each day and did as good a job as one would expect and replenished towels and toiletries. The rates are very competitive with other downtown hotels and, although the hotel is not necessarily cheap, it is after all, a hotel in downtown Vancouver and, as such, a hotel in downtown Vancouver will never be what one might describe as \"cheap\"! Finally, a word on the district: Davie Village is Vancouver's gay area but this shouldn't put people off. As is the way with Vancouver generally, the city manages to envelope all creeds, races and sexual preferences with great ease and candour, and Davie Village is a good example of this. As for the hotel being \"surrounded\" by adult shops (as was noted by a previous reviewer), I can't say that I'd agree.

The ceilings are very low and the hotel overall is in a ratty condition. First and foremost, housekeeping is not done on a daily basis here! Yuck, especially with a kitchen. The cleaners come and spend at most 5-8 minutes in the room. They spray some solution on the kitchen floor and make up the bed, and refresh the towels. I watched one day while she came in because I was wondering why my room had visible food stains in the kitchen, why the floor did not appear to be vacuumed and the ceramic floor was left dirty! For $200 a night, this is unacceptable! The stove was never cleaned off during my stay and I had to strip the bed of its sheets so they would be changed. The bathroom is about the smallest I have ever seen, only one person can fit in and it is a very tight squeeze and you are forced to back into the toilet just to close the door. Towels are rough and the shower pressure doesn't adjust to a gentle stream or mist, did I mention how small the bathroom is? The room showed noticeable signs of wear and tear, the furniture was ratty and the kitchen table and chairs were so cheap they seemed suitable for a 1st grade playset. The fridge, microwave and dishwasher are all modern and it is nice to have a kitchen in the room. The laundry machine is a European model which worked well, albeit takes some time. I had an oceanview room and the view is stunning, but the windows are so filthy you need to open the balcony door to enjoy it...the balcony was a nice touch. The living area is tight and the sofabed is only a twin and opens up directly into the desk/TV area, so no one can sit at the desk if the sofabed is pulled out. The complimentary internet connection here is wired and its very slow and I had to constantly restart it to get it to work. Quite annoying. Parking is $18.75 a day for valet and they were reasonably quick with the car (there is parking about a block away on Davie for $20 or so for 5 days. The entrance to the hotel is in a back alley and is very dangerous because there is a blind curve and when you enter, you can't see who exits, so you must move very slowly. The business center charges for internet access. The location is very good, I walked to Granville Island, downtown and Stanley Park and there are numerous affordable eating options along Davie Street (which is the gay center of Vancouver).

I had not previously seen Van from so high up, and it was simply breathtaking. We spent a fair amount of time on the balcony just enjoying the view (despite the rain, which was not a surprise) and especially the neon sign from the restaurant below us which made us laugh ( part of which read \"Do you smell burnt toast...then you are probably having a stroke\") and definitely got points for originality. The suite itself was fantastic - so nice to have something more than the regulation bedroom/bathroom. We had people over more than once and they also commented on how nice the place was, and convenient with the living/dining area - it can be awkward when you have people over to your hotel room and the only place they can sit is on the bed... the couch and chairs were essential and totally came in handy. I LOVED the kitchenette, and the dishwasher (big bonus points)..it was great to have the option to make our own food if we didn't feel like going out. As for the major issues found with any hotel stay - the suite was very clean and well maintained; staff were friendly and helpful; the location is central and we walked mostly everywhere we went; and most importantly - we could not hear a peep from the people above, below, or beside us. The decor in the main areas of the hotel and in our suite was very nice, and there was also plenty of room for storing clothes/coats/shoes etc. The only small drawback we encountered was parking - the valet couldn't park the standard vehicle we had brought, and actually called up to our room to ask us to come back down and park it for him. Then the next day when we asked for the car to be brought out front for us, we waited out front for about 15 minutes before going in to the front desk where they just handed us the keys. (!) This was not a huge deal to us but was something that came as a small surprise. After that we just parked in another lot down the street (about 2 minutes' walk away) - which ended up costing less than the valet anyway.

Compared to many downtown hotels, the rooms at the Sandman are definitely priced at the low end of the scale, and because of this, when I made my room reservation I was expecting a somewhat shabby family-style hotel with tired and worn decor and mininal amenities. I was SO wrong! I was welcomed into a very swish lobby that felt a bit like a trendy night spot. The wonderful staff at the front desk have somehow managed to find that magical balance between professionalism and genuine friendliness. I was quickly checked in by someone who truly seemed happy to be there! I stayed in a suite on the 21st floor with an absolutely jaw-dropping view of the West End, English Bay, Stanley Park, and the North Shore mountains. The suite had been recently renovated and featured cherry-coloured laminate flooring, a stylish kitchen with breakfast bar and black appliances, and fabulous plumbing fixtures. I wasn't expecting to find deliciously thick robes in the closet, in-suite laundry, and enough storage space to keep a small family happy for a week. I also wasn't expecting to find that the Sandman would have so many excellent facilities. The pool and the patio around it are just lovely. The pool change areas are gorgeous - all dark woods, with slate tiles and soft lighting. And there is an amazing looking spa (if you're into that - it's not my thing so I didn't go in), and a smallish but extremely well-equipped fitness room. I am a personal trainer, and I am used to shaking my head in bewilderment when some hotels claim to have a fitness room, but all that's in it is an elliptical and a treadmill. But this fitness centre rocks! Great selection of free weights, a couple of adjustable benches, decent range of machines, two BOSU's, body balls of various sizes, lots of stretching mats, medicine balls... it's just great!!! And there's no additional charge to use it! Oh yeah, and they have half a dozen cardio machines. But I would strongly recommend a run along the Stanley Park seawall Seawall instead - it's a runner's paradise :) I only stayed at the Sandman for one night to watch the HSBC Celebration of Lights (fireworks show), but as I drove away, I felt calm, serene, and happy.

We were lucky enough to have a \"bay view\" suite (all rooms are suites) on the 18th floor with a fantastic view of English Bay and a \"peek view\" of Stanley Park. This vantage point made watching the annual fireworks competition especially nice. Rooms on a lower floor may not have as nice a view. The suites were renovated a few years ago, with what appears to be IKEA cabinets/furnishings. But the color schemes and choices are very contemporary and upscale looking. The suite was small, but everything functioned well. The kitchen was stocked with basic cookware, flatware and dishes. Oddly enough, there were no paper towels or facial tissues in the suite, so we had to buy some at a nearby grocery store. The pool was nicely maintained, but we did not use the fitness facility or spa, so we cannot comment on it. We did enjoy the attached restaurant (Moxie's) and lounge. It seemed like an average value, and the food and drinks were quite good. The balconies have no furniture, so if you have folding chairs for the fireworks, use them on your balcony (as we did). The staff was, without exception, extremely friendly and helpful. The elevators did seem slow to come during peak times, and sometimes seemed frustrating for guests. If you like staying in suites, then this might well be a great place to stay. It was a little small for an extended stay, but was fine for a week or less. There is a washer/dryer in the suite, but we didn't ever try to use it.

We were going to ask to move up a few floors until the fire alarm went off and we had to walk down the stairs. The staff kept those of us wandering around outside the lobby doors informed and we were impressed to see a letter of apology from management posted on the inside of the elevators just shortly after the \"all-clear\" was given. As some other reviewers have noted, the elevators were VERY slow, the alley entrance was not entirely desirable, and sometimes the cleaning staff forgot to replace towels. But, generally the room was clean (and I'm very picky), the front-desk staff were friendly and helpful, and valet personnel were efficient. Our suite had a small kitchen with refrigerator, stove, microwave, kettle, dishware, utensils, etc. Very convenient.

The hotel is in a good location, in the city yet close to the beach, so an ideal location for exploring on foot. The kitchen contained an oven/hobs, microwave, full-size fridge/freezer, dishwasher, kettle, coffee maker, cutlery, crockery, pots and pans, dish cloths, dishwashing liquid and dishwashing powder. There was also a washer/dryer which enabled us to wash some clothes in the privacy of our own room (although you will have to provide your own laundry liquid). There was a breakfast bar, with chairs which separated the kitchen from the living room. The living room contained a sofa, coffee table and television. There was also a balcony connected to the living room, offering views of the city and the mountains. The bedroom was small, although it contained another television and a decent sized wardrobe (in addition to the wardrobe in the kitchen/living room). The bathroom contained a bath and a shower attached to the wall (not hand-held). The concierge was very helpful and he booked us an excellent tour to Grouse Mountain and Capilano Suspension Bridge, and he was even reluctant to accept a tip! Although overall we were pleased with our stay, there are a couple of minor criticisms. The housekeeping staff were not very thorough, for example, they did not empty the bins in the bathroom and did not clean the bath daily. They would also remove towels and dish cloths without replacing them. However, reception were very quick to replace the towels on request. The lifts were extremely slow, and staff also using these lifts further slowed down the system. There were occasions when a lift stopped, and we could not enter the lift because there was a member of staff inside with several bags of dirty laundry or similar, and there was no room for us inside the lift because of this. So we would have to wait several minutes for another lift to arrive and hope that there was room for us inside. However, the lifts also offer a security system in that a guest must insert their key card before pressing the floor number, in order to prevent those who are not guests at the hotel from gaining access. On arrival at the hotel our room was not ready (we arrived at 2pm), and although the receptionist was doing her best, we had to wait one hour before our room was available, which is not an ideal situation after a long journey. I find it hard to believe that they could not find one room available to us considering the size of the hotel. The bakery over the road (Sweet Success) offers a large selection of tempting goods. However, I purchased a sweet pastry and after eating half of the pastry, I discovered a live insect crawling underneath. I returned to the bakery two days later and the person behind the counter asked me to point out what I had purchased, and she was surprised herself to find several insects crawling around on the pastries and inside the tray. I was not expecting to find any insects there two days later! The drugmart opposite the hotel is a good place to do your food shopping, and here you can obtain maple syrup and maple cream cookies for less than you would expect to pay for these items in a tourist/gift shop. The farmers market a couple of doors away from the hotel, offers a wide selection of fresh, organic produce at reasonable prices. Granville Island is a good place to visit for souvenirs and gifts, if you want to get away from the typical tacky tourist shops! The Public Market contained several stands including, fresh meat, groceries, bakeries, gifts, as well as take-away food.

That was kinda bad to me. Upon entering the parking deck, you have to use your room key to open the gate. I do like the fact that your car is secure. Upon entering the elevator, you have to wait what seems like forever for the elevator to come down to the parking level, you have to also use your room key to operate the elevator. The room keys sometimes don't work, so you have to keep going to the lobby to get a new one. The rooms are small but have everything that you need. They are modern and up to date.

I'm sorry to say we experienced quite the opposite. I was stunned to reread these reviews based on the same hotel. I used TripAdvisor all the time for hotel referrals, and I've never been as shocked as I was with the Sandman. I have written a letter to Sandman requesting a refund on our room. Here are some of the excerpts from the letter: Heating. Our suite was absolutely freezing. We turned the heat up as high as possible, and while the bedroom (where the heater was located) stayed warm, the rest of the unit remained ice cold. There was a small vent, approximately 6\u201d x 6\u201d, from that heater that was supposed to warm the rest of the accommodation (see attached picture). It did not. We called the manager who told us there was nothing she could do except send up a space heater. An hour later our space heater arrived, broken and delivering cold air. We let it run for 45 minutes, waiting for it to \u201cheat up\u201d; it never did. The hallway outside our room remained at least 10 degrees (F) warmer than our room. To make things even worse, the heater in the bedroom sounded like a jet engine taking off every time it turned on. Bathtub. I ran the water in our bathtub, and dirty water came out. I wasn\u2019t alarmed because soon after clear water appeared. I then turned off the water and ran it again to clean the dirt from the tub. However, then a MUCH larger amount of dirt came out of the faucet. It was absolutely disgusting. We continued to clean out the dirt and run the bath, and as we did, the faucet fixture fell apart. Big surprise. General appearance of room, furniture and fixtures. The rest of room was in poor shape, as can be seen by the other pictures.

The staff on reception were always friendly and helpful (although I agree with one review that they could improve their knowledge of tourist activities in the Greater Vancouver area - but that's a minor point). My room in the hotel was great (although I didn't get a room with a view - only the 5th floor). I loved the fact that it had a washing machine in it and the separate lounge and bedroom was also quite pleasant - made it feel a bit more like a home away from home than a normal hotel room. The bed was almost a little too big for the bedroom! There was heaps of storage space (if you needed it). The kitchen was equipped with a dishwasher and a microwave. The free internet access is also great - there are only two terminals, but there was only one time when I wanted access and both terminals were occupied. The location is great. As with a previous reviewer, I didn't really get the gay vibe, but the hotel is surrounded by really good restaurants (esp if you like Greek food) and if you don't want to go too far, there is a restaurant/bar attached (Moxies) which serves great food (I think Moxies does the room service food as well, but i'm not sure). There are some 'panhandlers' around, but no one was intimidating or threatening and I felt safe at all times(and I was a female travelling alone). The hotel is only a short walk from the main shopping area, as well as Stanley Park. And if you want to take a bus, there is that option as well. I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I went to Vancouver again.", "Date": "November 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cSandman a value for Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "DizzEDenver", "ReviewID": "UR3992594", "Content": "We stayed at the Sandman on Davie for 2 nights and it was our favorite hotel of the 2 we stayed at in Vancouver and 1 in Victoria.

You have great access from there to many cool tourist areas of the city. Didn't have much interaction with the hotel staff, so can't comment much on that (perhaps because everything was taken care of?). They did let us check in early and held our bags for a short time after we checked out. The Sandman is in the gay district and my traveling companion and I are not gay, but that part of the city hosts a lot of cool bars and coffee shops and has lower crime than other parts. We thought the styling of the rooms and lobby was really cool. Good views from the balcony. Moxies bar (connected to the lobby) was impressive. Even the bathrooms in there are great (flat screen TV's, fireplaces, plants, etc). The bar staff was above and beyond friendly.

I spoke to the manager, whom I had dealt with directly in making the reservation, and asked him why we did not get a renovated room. He insisted that it had been renovated but had no problem assigning us to another room, which was the same design, but cleaner and less scuffed up. It worked just fine for us. At $145 CDN a night, we really did not expect more.

I apologize for it's length but I want future guests to know what is in store for them should they decide to stay here. I read the reviews before I went and thought the bad reviews were just being picky and, not being a particularly picky person, I figured I'd be fine. And for the most part, I was. There were just a few problems that I think need to be addressed. First of all the good stuff. The location is great if you're a city person who likes staying in a real neighborhood as opposed to a tourist-only area. The West End has a real pulse and we had a blast. Although I imagine folks not used to an urban and open-minded environment might find the area a bit eye-opening, we're Chicagoans and we loved it. The rooms are also great. I loved the kitchen and the washer/dryer as well as the balcony. I was a little surprised that a room so recently rehabbed would have peeling wallpaper and a toilet not fully attached to the floor, but otherwise I loved the amenities and the space. It's so nice to have a suite with something besides a bed to sit on, it's so much comfier. I didn't think there was an issue with the size of the room at all. Okay, and now for the bad... Cleanliness. Big issue. When we arrived late on Saturday night, exhausted from a long drive, all we wanted to do was make our plans for the next day and go to sleep. The first thing we noticed was some previous guest's used q-tip on the top of the refrigerator. Yuck. Then, as I was getting into bed, I pulled the comforter back to reveal pillows with someone else's hair on them and sheets that looked suspiciously rumpled, as if they hadn't been changed since the last guest. My revulsion was offset by my exhaustion so I slept on the bed anyway, but it was not pleasant. Then next morning I went down to the front desk to ask that our room be thoroughly cleaned while we were out and to inquire how to locate the high-speed internet connection in our room. We had read, direct from the hotel manager's response to an earlier review, that high-speed internet access was going to be standard in every room by the end of March. Here is a direct quote from his response: \"We are currently installing full high speed internet access into our guest rooms. This installation will be completed by March 31, 2005.\" Based on this, we decided to bring our laptop with us on the trip to help us plan our daily activities and keep in touch with our family and housesitter. Well, the two gentlemen behind the desk were apologetic about the room but looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about the internet connection. They said that there were modems available for rent ($5 a day) but other than that the only place with an internet connection was the \"business center,\" a stifling hot room about 6'x10' with two computers and one extra line that was in continual use. The gentlemen at the front desk were kind enough to waive the fee on the modem since we'd had problems with our room and had one sent up to us. Sounds great right? Well, the modem was completely useless. The connection speed was so slow we couldn't so much as check our email much less visit any sites with images. So we lugged our laptop to Vancouver for no reason, as we only managed to quickly check our email twice the whole week. The rest of the time the business center was in use. Naturally I couldn't get on tripadvisor the whole time so I wasn't able to verify what I'd read about internet access in the rooms until we got home. Which reminds me of another problem, the room had no booklet or binder with the amenities and other information listed. I thought that was pretty standard in most hotels, am I mistaken? But let me go back to the cleanliness issue. As I said, I'd asked them to make sure our room was cleaned thoroughly and our sheets changed, as well as the q-tip removed while we were out. We left for over four hours and the room was not cleaned. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because we had returned a little earlier than expected to have a nap, but I asked the front desk as we left that afternoon to make sure it was done when we returned. The woman assured me that, even if a thorough cleaning couldn't be arranged that late in the day, at the very least the sheets would be changed and the garbage removed. When we returned that night, the sheets had indeed been changed but the q-tip remained on top of the refrigerator. In fact, it was there for the remainder of our stay, even though I asked a THIRD time to make sure our room was properly cleaned. Yes, we could've thrown it out ourselves, I realize that. But it was a matter of principle. I felt if something that obvious was overlooked, perhaps other things were overlooked as well, like the cleanliness of the toilet or the dishes in the room. In fact, although everyone we met on the staff was exceedingly friendly, I would say a big issue was lack of attention to responsibilities, large and small. For instance, when we arrived we asked where we could park our car. We knew that we had to pay for parking and were prepared to do so, but were surprised when the woman gave us only one option for parking-- the hotel's valet. So for our entire stay we had to deal with waiting for the valet to get our car, tipping the valet each time, having to clean out our car each day because we couldn't go back out to get anything out of it, AND paying a hefty daily fee for the \"privilege\" of this service. It wasn't until the night before we left that we found out from another guest that the hotel also had a paid parking lot that allowed the guests to park the car themselves without having to deal with the hassle of a valet. We were so frustrated when we found this out because we never asked for a valet, it was forced on us. Not only that, one time the valet lost our little valet ticket somewhere in the 5 minutes it took him to get our car. He promised he'd drop it off at the front desk but, sure enough, nobody knew anything about it when we inquired later that day. So then we had to go through a 15 minute hassle of explaining to 3 different people what had happened so we could get a new valet ticket for the car. Other small annoyances happened, like requested items being promised but never arriving, \"clean\" towels with long hairs on them, and no one answering the phone when we called the front desk, but one very large problem and potentially hazardous situation happened late one night. At about 2:00 am, we awoke to the sound of the fire alarm. Very scary. We threw on our clothes and scrambled down 15 flights of stairs to get outside. Unfortunately, the stairwell we descended opened up to the parking garage (the one my husband and I never were given the option to use). This was troublesome to me because the only way out of this garage was a large metal automatic gate. What if the power was out? Would we have been trapped behind that gate? Fortunately the power was still on so we were able to trip the gate mechanism and head outside, but that was still a scary thought. When we got outside, I realized something else quite troubling. There were plenty of guests waiting outside but never once did I see any member of the staff. When it was finally determined to be a false alarm, we heard the news from another guest who asked a fireman. When we returned to the lobby to make our way back up to our rooms, still no staff anywhere that I could see. I don't know exactly what responsibilities a hotel staff has in the case of an emergency, but I would've thought that someone would be directing guests and generally handling the problem. The next day we received an note apologizing for the false alarm from the hotel manager, which was nice but in some ways unnecessary. False alarms happen and can't be helped and I certainly prefer a false alarm over a real emergency! But the real and potentially dangerous problem, a staff perhaps not properly equipped to handle an emergency, wasn't addressed by the manager and really should be.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kilmarnock, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat with only one complaint\u201d", "Author": "killiegcm", "ReviewID": "UR3730782", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Sandman for 5 nights and 3 nights before and after our tour of the Rockies.
