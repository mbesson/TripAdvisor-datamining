However upon contacting the cleaning company, they informed me they did not know anything about the situation and therefore denied all knowledge of 'taking legal action against me'.

Found this hotel on Laterooms for \u00c2\u00a369. As it was a Days Inn I thought it would be good, as I have stayed at Days Inn before. Arrived at hotel, very easy to find. Only 5 mins walk from Pimlico underground station. First impressions were good - The street was quiet and tidy, and outside the hotel looked fine. The reception was also clean. Checked in, took them 15 minutes as my booking was quite late. I noted the rack rate was advertised at \u00c2\u00a3125 per night. The room was 106 on the ground floor, a 5 seconds walk from reception. The room was clean, but small. There was a burnt mark on the floor caused by the iron, but the room itself seemed ok. The bed was comfortable, the TV worked properly, and the bathroom was functional although small. The shower though was very powerful, that possibly was the best thing about the room. The view from the room.... well look out the window and you would see a brick wall!! Literally there is a half a meter gap and then a solid brick wall, so no view at all. I guess you could say it is a mini patio, although it did make the room hot. Days inn did provide items such as toothbrush and toothpaste for free, and the shower gel/shampoo provided seemed quality stuff. We slept fine, did not hear any noises from other guests or staff, and no traffic could be heard. I noticed the hotel advertises on the internet a bar, room service and a restaurant but it actually has none of them at all. So would I stay here again? If I could not find a better hotel for a good value price then maybe, I would not pay above \u00c2\u00a370 for it though. Im not sure if this is a Days Inn any more though, the room had no Days Inn brochure/adverts, and except for the sign above the door and an invoice with the brand name you would not guess its a Days inn.

Upon checking in, we provided our debit card and were told that the total for the stay would be \"pre-authorised\" until we checked out. On 05/06/11 we noticed that our account was significantly \"lighter\", and on investigation, it transpired that the hotel had debited the \u00c2\u00a3240 total for our stay, and the \"pre-authorised\" figure (the same amount) was still being held. I called the hotel on 05/06/11 to request this sum be released, as it can take up to a week otherwise, and was curtly told \"it takes 72 hours, you just have to wait\". I adivsed the lady on reception that this was not acceptable and I needed to speak to somebody that could rectify the situation. Eventually I was transferred to the accounts department (who, evidently, was dealing with a similar complaint for another customer) and the gentleman there (Assad) said he would look into it \"in the next hour or so\". 2 hours later I called back, only to be informed that Assad had gone home, but had left a note (where was my phone call?!) stating that he had called someone else and had been told that they had only debited one amount. Again, I had to explain that yes, only one sum had been debited, but an additional sum was being held. The gentleman I spoke to on this occassion (Prentin) could not have been more unhelpful if he had tried. When I stated that we had not been told that the money would be held, and that we would have happily paid for the stay upfront rather than go through the inconvenience and stress of having our money rendered inaccessible. His response was \"well, you could have paid with a different card\"... this would not have helped, as the pre-authorised amount would still be held. As we were at a stalemate, I asked for the contact details for Head Office and was given a number to call. I spoke to another gentleman (Steven) who seemed sympathetic and gave the impression that this practice was incorrect. Steven advised that he was escalating my complaint and would get somebody to call me. By lunchtime on 06/07/11 I had not heard anything, so called and spoke to Steven again, who said he would chase the complaint (though, this time, he definitely seemed less interested in my problem). This morning (07/07/11) I called Head Office again and was advised that the person Steven probably emailed was off sick, and my complaint would be passed to somebody else. I received a phonecall back from a lady (whose name I did not take) who advised that this hotel had left the group at the end of last month, but she would ask for the owner to call me. I have received no further phonecalls and we are still waiting for the money to be released. This really is not good enough- as I said earlier, we would happily have paid for the room in advance, rather than have to deal with this. I have spent over an hour on the phone and have had to borrow money from friends as this was to be our money for the week. I cannot express how upsetting this whole ordeal has been, and at the moment I have absolutely zero faith that the hotel will do anything to help the situation- I suspect that the money will just be released as it usually would anyway. With regards to our actual stay- the communal areas of the hotel are extremely rundown, room was small but clean, but was absolutely boiling. We were on the top floor and it's like a furnace up there. The weather this weekend was fairly warm, but not hot- it was much cooler outside than in our oven of a room! The lift was pretty terrifying too. We are used to staying somewhere a bit more central so this felt very out of the way. Reception staff on check in seemed helpful, but when we called down to ask for them to book a taxi, they basically said no! You can get better value for money elsewhere, so please do!

The website promised neat modern spacious rooms, clean refurbished bathroom, a classic English breakfast, and an overall cozy atmosphere. In reality everything turned completely different from what we expected from these over-promising statements. When we arrived, the receptionist could not find our booking (that i made online) in his records, and i had to unpack my luggage at the reception to prove that i had a reservation. Moreover, after the booking was confirmed, it turned out that the needed room was unavailable. We wanted a twin room, and instead were given a double bedroom. The most outrageous fact is that he didn't apologies, but started to argue that I did not mention this request while booking the room online. In fact, there was no even this option (to choose from either one or the other room type) on their website, which implies that on arrival the hotel should offer an option to choose from. This is an ordinary procedure that any hotel should stick to. After this horrible check-in, we got a \"double\" room, which was not even close to double, and rather nearly enough for one person. And it smelled awful! All these things were accompanied with a rude and extremely impolite service, as the receptionist was shouting while we tried to solve the room availability issue, blaming that \"I sneaked around\" to check his words. Although he was not the manager of the hotel (it was happening after midnight, and the manager was at home), he tried to threaten me saying that he can turn us out without giving any room at all. The second room was located in the basement, and it was very noisy with vibrating floor because of the working generator (which was somewhere close to our room).

We flew to London Heathrow from Glasgow and getting to The City couldnt be easier. We got 2 Weekend Rail Tickets (\u00c2\u00a321 each) and this gave you access to both underground and the buses. The underground train (Picadilly Line) takes about 45 mins to Green Park Station and then its the Victoria Line to Pimlico and its round the corner from there. The hotel let us into our room at 12.45pm although we werent meant to get in until 2pm so that was a bonus as we got to drop our bags and head out. The room was on the small side as was the bathroom but its a base for sleeping ?? We had a double bedded room and it comes with hairdrier and trouser press is you need that sort of thing. The Bathroom had a large Shower cubicle but again not much room to move when two are in there. I couldnt comment on the Food served at the hotel as we never ate there but the staff were friendly and pleasant enough. The underground station is a 2-3 min walk away and the hotel is also served by the No.24 bus which stops directly outside the hotel. You couldnt ask for more !! Travelling time into the city is about 10 mins on the bus and roughly the same on the Underground given that you have to change trains a few times.

You expect a `standard' approach from chain hotels, which can be disappointing in terms of a `genuine' experience, but I'm a brit, so it didnt really matter. The hotel though was a huge let down. The hotel seemed in a good location, and in practice the surrounding area is rather nice, the common areas were clean, and the hotel pretty well furnished. So the negatives.. I called the hotel to ask about parking - because the website wasnt clear, and should have picked up at that point the key problem here - the staff. The girl on reception had a poor standard of English, and effectively couldnt wait to get me off the phone when I started asking about nearby parking options. Apparently there was a meter outside - cheers for that, other than this I was met with very long silences, I gave up and went to try and find one on the web. On arriving at about 1.40pm, the girl on reception told us our room wouldnt be ready until after 2 - we looked around to survey at least one other couple waiting - did we really have to wait for 20 minutes?... I suspect a tad more investigation might have found our room ready, she didnt even offer me the opportunity to check in, so you can gauge she hadnt even checked the reservation, 0/10 so far. We were given the key to the luggage room, the girl utterly oblivious to a 3 hour drive to the hotel, and 20 minute walk in the cold to the hotel from where we parked the car. Did I mention parking was an issue! \u00c2\u00a345 for 29 Hours at the nearest NCP. If you're driving, avoid this hotel. So, we come back, get to our room, sold as a family room, to sleep three adults. It was tiny, for the money we were paying. We went downstairs and asked if the hotel could get a cab for us, we were simply told we'd be better off trying our luck on Belgrave Road outside reception that if they ordered it would be a 15 minute wait, again bad attitude from the girl on reception. The night porter was worse when we got back. The machine swallowed a \u00c2\u00a31, and I advised him, he wasnt prepared to do anything for me, until my wife - by now fed up with these clowns, told him we were finally fed up with the attitude of the staff in this hotel, he proceeded to tell her to calm down, she quite rightly told him his attitude stank whereon he did give me my money back. \u00c2\u00a31 is neither here nor there its just the overall way the staff behave here which is the matter. The hotel management need to get this sorted. The hotel bar shuts at 930pm, the breakfast is \u00c2\u00a37 per head extra on top of the exorbitant fee, the walls were paper thin too. I could go on. But my final comment is simply if you want somewhere to put your head down close to Victoria Station, and don't care then go to this hotel. My belief is that a 2 star hotel should do the basic things well. Be polite to your customers, as polite as they are in a 5 Star, offer clean rooms of an acceptable size, and if you offer facilities then ensure they are managed and run to offer service which makes the guests stay a pleasant one. I originally gave this two stars - I'm deducting one, reading the above, and suggest if you feel the same way I do then avoid the place. I'll finish on a final up note - want a good breakfast for half the price of the days inn? and although i didnt have it Imagine nicer - walk up to the george and dragon en route to Victoria Station, we had a really excellent breakfast in nice surroundings.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cOverall Good Value\u201d", "Author": "VSJEngland", "ReviewID": "UR23158983", "Content": "We have just returned from staying at the Days Inn, Westminster to celebrate the New Year.

Shower was very nice and hot which we needed as; The Major drawback to this room was the draft through the windows, appreciate the building is very old but even with the radiators on there was on constant draft, bearing in mind it was -3 degrees outside and probably not much more inside, so we had to keep layers of clothes on all the time we were in, we also had to use all of the extra blankets provided. obviously this wouldnt be issue in the summer!

This hotel is clean, basic and comfortable at an affordable price for london. We booked this hotel after scouring many sub \u00c2\u00a360 per night hotels for a cheap weekend in london. We picked this hotel as previous reviews have said it was exactly what we were looking for. The hotel is situated on Belgrave road in the quiet suburb of Pimlico. We we're a little apprehensive at first of staying here as we had never visted this area of london before but the hotel is on a street of townhouses and other hotels. The road that the hotel is on was rather quiet, we didn't hear any traffic noise during the night whatsoever. The hotel check in was fast and the staff we're freindly, we were given a room on the 3rd floor but we had to drag our cases up the stairs as the lift was tiny and as we're all fairly fit we could walk up the stairs rather than waiting. Our room was small but had a double bed, a desk, cuboard, tv, tea and coffee making facilities and a bathroom with shower. Even though it was small it was in good working order and most importantly of all, spotlessly clean! The bathroom came with soaps, towels and you could ask reception for supplies if you forgot toothbrush, shaver etc. To be honest with you for the price we paid we we're very suprised by the room. Its not the type of room you'd want to spend a week in but for 2 nights it was perfectly fine. Besides whos going to be stuck in a room all the time in london? Not me! The hotel is not far at all from the Pimlico underground station, but due to my poor navigation skills when we arrived it took alot longer than expected to get there, when i got my bearings it was around 5 minutes away and in the area there we're 2 pubs and a few supermarkets.

I got the room for \u00c2\u00a370 through an online booking site which seems expensive but judjing from other reports, is reasonable for London. I noticed the front-desk price was double that which it certainly was not worth. I had to pay a \u00c2\u00a310 (refundable) deposit in case I used any 'extras'. I didn't see any 'extras' in the room except for the pay-per-view movie and adult channels. The room had a hot radiator though it was still cold in the room.

The reason for our stay there was because we required a QUAD room - there are very few quad accommodations in London. The room was tight for four people - very small bathroom - but clean. Cleanliness is the most important thing to me! We had a wee balcony overlooking a very busy street. It got quite loud at night, especially because our street was full of youth hostels. So young adults (if you could call them adults) would be out in the street all hours making loads of noise. I felt the concierge could have been more helpful - when asking questions they were very reluctant and didn't have any suggestions for supermarkets or eateries. This was our second trip to London - so we felt like we knew it pretty well. I'd have been a little put off if it had been my first trip.

Continental breakfast is included and very nice. One can upgrade breakfast include eggs, bacon etc at additional price. It is walkable with luggage from Victoria station but not for the weak. I was definitely having a workout lugging suitcases for 28 minutes.IT would be best to transfer to Pimlico Tube station and walk 5 minutes to Days Inn. Buy Day pass before getting on tube so that you can go back out to sight see after checking in hotel 15 minute walk to Victoria tube, train and coach station. 27 minute walk to Buckingham palace. 5 minute walk to laundrette and Pimlico tube station. HINT: to take tubes go out front door to right to Pimlico tube station. It is closer than Victoria tub station. If you are going anywhere in central London it is still only a 1 zone trip although you will probably have to transfer at Victoria station. Look into day pass for tubes. The pub right next to Pimlico tube station is nice with good family food. If you book day tours through Evan Evans tours, you can pick up tour 15 minute walk on Vauxhall Blouvard or at Victor coach station.....Jack the ripper tour is different and 10 hour tour to Oxford University and Warwick castle was great. Victoria at front desk was a sweet heart and very helpful. You might want to request room away from front as street got noisy when pubs closed at 2:00 Am.

Now to be fair it wasn't all bad in fact there were many positive aspects to our stay. The room was of a reasonable size the hotel clean and the staf by enlarge pleasent and responsive to our requests and enquiries. Again the continental breakfast was adequate and facilities good. However when an hotel quotes in its lierature that their ethos is to provide good, clean accomodation at a reasonable price where everything works and then it doesn't, that irks. Our room had non-functioning lights, a badly cracked wash basin a kettle which broke down on first use and housekeeping who had not cleaned our room by 2.00pm then obviously not everything worked. We had two doors to the room with a gap between to cusion noise which was very good. But one door didn't close properly on its automatic closure and had to be pulled closed while the other had fallen on its hinges and jammed against the upper part of the frame and again needed to be pulled closed with a hefty tug. Add to that the fact that an English Breakfast costs \u00c2\u00a34.00 extra for scrambled egg and bacon and this does not constitute good value either. Along with that was the frustration of a long narrow dining room with a buffet breakfast (either EB or continental) which meant shuffling up and down squeezing past other breakfasters to get to your selected table. Now the location of this hotel is good, near to both attractions and transport links and while we were there the area seemed pleasently quiet. But don't expect perfection or anything near.

London, England SW1V 2BJ on June 4th & 5th, 2007.. We had been to Iceland and Scotland without any problems and arrived at the Days Inn at 11:15pm. We were given the keys to room 364 and took the elevator which dropped us off on the wrong floor even though we had hit the right button. Upon entering the room we noticed it had no resemblance to the pictures we saw on the Expedia-Days inn website. In fact, the room did not even match the pictures on the brochure from the Days Inn lobby. In addition, the room smelled and the shower door was broken making difficult to enter or get out of the shower. Since it was late we decided to stick it out and stay, however lying down to sleep we noticed several small insects in the bed with wings. I tried to catch one but they would leap and were impossible to catch. Whether they were bed-bugs or flew in from the screenless window didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter to us, we knew we had to leave for health reasons. In fact I had been in the bed for about 15 minutes and I sustained a bite above my ankle (I have a pic but don't want to disgust people reading this). We packed up and went to the lobby for checkout around 12:15 am. The desk clerk Smadar was very unsympathic and said that we were getting what we paid for in a 3 star hotel. I said no hotel should contain insects and asked if Smadar would stay in a room with insects if he were on vacation with his family. Still, nothing seemed to get through and I was told no refund would be given so I had him call a cab and we left at 12:15am tired and disgruntled. We ended up staying at a Marriott which cost $475 US dollars per night.(compared to the Days Inn $214 per night). Days Inn gave us a refund for 1 night but with the night they charged us for plus the Marriott, cabfare ($25 US), and calls to the Days Inn Manager ($25) we ended up spending $570 in unforeseen expenses (not to mention the hours I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spent calling Expedia at work and trying to get a hold of the Days Inn Manager while still in London). Regarding the Manager, Mr. Ali Rizwan, I called the following morning from a payphone (June 6th) and explained my predicament and that a full refund would be needed given the hardship, insects, and terrible shape/smell of the room. He said he would need to check with his managers and call in pest control to check the room. I called several times from the payphone in London and he kept saying he had to check with his supervisors and that the pest control folks had not found anything. Given the insects had wings they could have easily flown out of the screenless window so this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at all surprise me. Also, he said the pest control co. was under contract for Days Inn so finding bugs would be a conflict of interest and could result in their contract being nullified. Since I was flying home I gave Mr. Rizwan my phone # and e-mail address and he promised to contact me with his supervisors refund info. After a few days I had heard nothing which surprised me because he seemed professional when I spoke to him on the phone. Finally I called with my cell phone (Verizon charges me $1.50US per min.) and though I called during his hours (London time) I was continually told he was not there and that he would get back to me, I left my contact info. each call. Even writing this letter I have yet to hear back any info from him.

Each time I would be put on hold for several minutes then the rep. would try and call Mr. Rizwan to see if a refund would be issued, it was like I had to call Expedia to remind them to contact Days Inn! For the last call it took them 30 minutes to say that Days Inn would only issue a credit for 1 night and I asked to speak to a supervisor whereby I was told I would be on hold for 2 hours before getting through. It was like the rep didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want me to talk to someone over their head and while I was on hold she kept saying that I should just accept the 1 night refund and it was a good deal, I informed her it was not acceptable and left my phone # and asked for the supervisor to call me back and I never heard a thing from them after that.

The tube system is easy, but closest station is still at Victoria station. Cost 10 dollars to take a taxi to see Mama Mia (great show). The neighborhood is nice and quiet, and the hotel was clean and friendly. The rooms are tiny by USA standards. This is common in Europe, but still had to dance around the suitcases to get to the restroom.
