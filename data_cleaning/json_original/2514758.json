Breakfast was pretty good and the staff were charming, helpful and always went the extra mile. The really good thing about the hotel was it was a great price, about \u00a385 per night for two of us when booked with the Eurostar.

The rooms were tidy, but I did not find them as clean as I would typically experience. i.e. there were toiletries in the bathroom which were unopened, but the wrapping was water-stained from previous guests.

Our issues were flukes, but how a staff handles these types of situations makes A LOT of difference, and in that arena, this hotel totally failed. Not to mention all these issues in a ONE night stay. I\u2019ll start with the good: Our room was spacious, even with an enormous bed The shower was splendid, big enough for two and a \u201crain\u201d style with water that got wonderfully hot (this is what caused one issue, but we\u2019ll get to that) It was quiet, and tastefully decorated The location is excellent, two minute walk from Metro station with quick access to Gare du Nord Miscellaneous odd bits: I had a real hard time figuring out that the lights would only turn on when the plastic door key was inserted into the switch \u2013 since it was pitch black in the room on our arrival, I had no chance at even figuring this out on my own and with no head\u2019s up when we checked in. This same key would also give us trouble later one, but we\u2019ll get to that The bathroom door was a sliding glass door that did not close all the way. When it slid to cover the door opening, it left a really wide (like inch) gap all the way around the sides and top. So the other guest in your room can see, and worse, hear everything. Horrible design. Now for the really bad: #1 During my evening shower the hotel fire alarm went off. Bad enough, having to panic, dry off quickly and figure out what the hell is going on. Then the staff came to our door and said it was OUR bathroom alarm that had triggered the whole building. They asked if we were smoking in our room. We said no, but there was steam from the shower (which should not make a difference but all we could really say about it). They clearly didn\u2019t believe us but at least I didn\u2019t have to go out in the cold with wet hair. #2 After getting home later that same night, our key would not work in our door. Kept showing the red light and on the third push in, it got stuck (with half the key sticking out). My husband went downstairs to get the night staff member, explained the problem, then went to use the lobby bathroom while I waiting on the stairs. Husband returns to find that the staff member has PUSHED THE KEY ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE LOCK. Why? WE have no idea. Now what? The guy says they\u2019ll call a lock smith in the morning and put us up in an open room in the meantime. No apologies for the inconvenience (or for making a bad situation worse!), and we spend the night without access to tooth brushes, contact solution, pajamas, face wash, you get the idea\u2026 Next morning at 930a I call down to see if they have in fact called the lock smith to get this sorted straight away. He can\u2019t understand me so I go down, and he assures me someone\u2019s been called and at my exasperation when he can\u2019t tell me when he expects the lock smith will show up, starts going on about how they just can\u2019t understand how we (meaning my husband and I) could have broken the lock the way we did. We were infuriated \u2026 still no apology and now an accusation?! We left it for the moment as we just wanted the problem fixed and not to make it worse. We finally got access to our room at about 1130a. We get immediately in the shower and guess what \u2026 #3 The fire alarm for the building goes off again! My husband gets out of the shower to call down to explain that no, we are not smoking, and then gets back in the shower. Minutes later, a staff member lets themselves into our room to see what the issue is! It\u2019s starting to turn into a joke at this point. #4 After all this, they have the gall to call our room to remind us that check out is noon \u2026. Even though we\u2019d only had access to our room for the last 30 minutes, 10 of which were spent dealing with staff and phone calls about their faulty fire alarm. Wow. So, yes, very one-off issues but handled so very VERY poorly by the staff that it made a bad situation worse. When we checked out and said we expected a refund since we technically did not stay in the room we paid for (not even getting into the fire alarm, the broken door, the accusations), they would not budge, just kept saying they would have to contact the night man first to find out if he indeed was responsible for the key (yeah, that will happen) and only assured us they would not make us PAY for the broken door. Again, just wow. Other than the egregious weird issues, it was a lovely hotel. So, if you like, you can try your luck ... we won't be returning to this hotel.

The room had a small bathroom, but the shower (rain) was excellent. Breakfast was included on a rate of 130 euros - and it was Ok with reasonable continental-type selection. The cooked food at breakfast looked awful though. Coffee was dispensed through a machine.

The hotel is in easy walking distance to the gare du nord and gare de l'est. Also very close to poissonniere metro station. We even walked into the centre of paris which is easy enough if you like walking. Overall a pleasant stay but a little expensive for the actually time spent in the room.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunedin, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cEurostars Panorama okay for wheelchair\u201d", "Author": "rugbytommo", "ReviewID": "UR75374775", "Content": "We stayed there because of proximity to Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est but It is not so close that you cannot get lost.

The male receptionist was friendly, polite and offered us a wonderful room. The room itself was huge, the bed would have easily fit four people and the shower room was spotless. As others have said there is a slight issue with the sliding doors not reaching the other side, but it seems it could easily be rendered by the hotel with a screwdriver. If you're comfortable with your partner its not an issue, but if with a work colleague probably best to get separate rooms. The shower had a superb rainforest head perfect for heating up from the cold outside. A 30 second walk from the hotel a supermarket, pasta shop, bakery and the metro station can be found.

I stayed in this hotel in late June 2008. I think at that point it had been renovated for not too long. When booking the room online I remember seeing a mix of new and old pictures of a dated and gaudy looking hotel claiming to be this hotel (it had the same address). Well rest assured, Hotel Eurostars Panorama has been complete renovated and it is extremely modern and classy looking now. My partner and I were very pleased with the room. It was a little small, but suitable for a few nights stay. The room was very clean with a huge and comfy bed taking up most of the space. There is a work table with a lamp that didn't get used much though during our trip and also a little storage area for hanging up coats, suits, etc. Our room faced the inside of the hotel which didn't lend a great view, but it was quiet. You could even see into some of the rooms because they are situated so close. The bathroom was small but clean. The sink did have some stains in it, which was odd considering it was relatively new then. If you are not going with your partner, then privacy could be an issue as the bathroom is separated from the rest of the room only by a sliding door and is not by any means sound proof! Otherwise, it is fine. The power shower and rainshower was probably the highlight of the whole room for me. I absolutely loved the rainshower and could be in there all day! There were some basic toiletries and a hair dryer provided and also plenty of towels. Location-wise, the hotel is on a quiet side street, close to Poissonni\u00e8re and walking distance to Gare du Nord, making it very convenient to catch the Eurostar, which is how we arrived. There is a supermarket nearby too so you can stock up on snacks and drinks. We didn't really need to ask the staff for anything, but they were all friendly from what I recall. We didn't have the breakfast because it was very pricey and from what I read it's not that great. Contrary to what it says on their website, our room did not have a bathtub, just a shower stall. There were also no coffee/tea making facilities, which they don't provide, but we would have liked. There were some teething problems during our stay like wifi internet not working as promised and it took awhile to get our room ready/confirmed. We were also given keycards to our room that did not work. But the front desk helped us sort those out when we went back to them. A cleaning lady knocked on our door once too before we were due to check out. Slight inconveniences, but overall very enjoyable stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for an affordable, clean, stylish, comfortable hotel in an excellent central location with great transport links.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cLarge comfy rooms, excellent staff, modern refurb, awesome shower\u201d", "Author": "Camnicsydney", "ReviewID": "UR43132016", "Content": "My partner and I stayed here early september and absolutely loved this hotel. A very last minute decision we booked online the morning of our arrival. The front desk receptionist, Susannah is worth her weight in gold. She was super friendly, helpful and efficient. We had a room on the 1st floor at the back of the hotel and even though it didnt have a view it was exceptionally quiet. The room was huge in paris terms. The bed was a total dream....the shower had a 'rain shower' with excellent water pressure and it was so spacious. The floors were made of floor boards which had a nice clean, hygienic feel to them, great wireless internet and overall just perfect. We paid 123 euro/nt direct through their website and even though it was slightly more than we intended to pay we were overwhelmed with our overall stay. We didnt get breakfast included but the location was excellent. there was a supermarket less than 50 mtrs away, metro was 2 blocks and not to mention a fantastic choice of bakeries, patisseries and cafes to try.

This wasn't too much bother so we decided to stick with it. Location of hotel was excellent, very near to both the Gare du Nord and a Metro Line (Pink No 7). Room was on 6th floor and quite small but spotlessley clean (as were communal areas). Bathroom was a little wierd - a glass box type affair in the corner of the room (taking up quite a lot of the tiny floorspace!!) Glass totally opaque but still felt a little bit 'public'. Also, the sliding door didn't shut properley, leaving a 3 or 4 inch gap giving your comapnion a full-on view into the loo! This is ok if you're very close with the person you're travelling with - if you're a little more shy, it might bother you a lot!! TV looked nice, just didn't work properley at all. There was meant to be a selection of channels, but it was very limited and the reception was awful - a good picture required one person to stand by the window and if they moved, then the picture fuzzed and turned black and white - frustrating!! Also, no WiFi access at all over the three nights we were there, and no internet access either on the computer in the reception area. These things were all little problems as we weren't in the hotel a lot, but the breakfasts were a totally different matter....... On the first morning we arrived for breakfast and it still wasn't all laid out, despite it being 20 minutes after 'opening' time. The coffee came from a machine and was awful. On the second morning the coffee machine was broken and there was a nice jellified lump of cold eggs and some chopped up frankfurters left in the hot breakfast section - yum. I asked for coffee from the kitchen, was told to go away and wait. 10 minutes later, a tiny pot arrived. On the third morning there was no coffee at all (!!!!) and only tea on offer. Again, no bacon, just a cold lump of rubbery egg and no frankfurter this time either. Along with the lack of coffee, this broke my patience, so on check out later that morning, I complained about the (expensive) but awful breakfasts and was told that I could have a 4 Euro discoount on that morning's breakfast and no more! Not wonderful then on the customer service side of things.........
