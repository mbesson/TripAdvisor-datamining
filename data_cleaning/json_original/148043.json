El Convento is an amazing property, kind of a cross between a museum filled with beautiful artifacts and a modern hotel with all of the required amenities. I requested a room on the top floor, with a view of the water, and they assigned me to room 512, which was perfect. It was in a great location for walking all over Old San Juan, which I did each day of my stay. The staff is professional and personable, the food of a very high quality, the accommodations comfortable and beautiful.

But the room was well-appointed with nice linens, outfitted with a large flat screen, and included a nice seating area. I enjoyed opening the large windows and watching outside.

They emailed me confirmations, left me voicemails, and made sure I had directions on where to go for the tour. Annette was particularly helpful with this! All of the staff was really helpful with restaurant recommendations, walking maps, etc. The walking tour with David was packed full of information. The history was cool, but the hubs and I got a little tired in the heat and with all of the details. David was pretty enthusiastic, so we hung in there. I might skip this next time as we are not big history buffs. We enjoyed the wine & cheese hour, the views from the balconies, and the onsite bar. We did breakfast one morning and while it was good, it was overpriced and there was some construction going on at the time so it was pretty noisy. The price was a little more than we would have liked, but we didn't need a car during that time, we had wonderful accommodations, and loved the walking proximity to most of the things we wanted to do locally (i.e. forts, shopping, restaurants, and nightlife).

My reviews are honest and forthright. So lets get to the hotel. If anyone tells you there is a better hotel that is better at capturing the essence of Old San Juan, they are dead wrong. We stayed here for 5 days and traveled ALL of old san juan....and to be honest, this is absolutely the best thing there. By saying that, i'm not putting down OSJ, it's just a testament to how enjoyable Hotel El Convento is. Where to start? Every single room walks out to a beautiful courtyard containing a beautiful tree with plenty of conquis that serenade you every night. You never walk down a hallway to your room, your room opens to a 10 foot wide walkway that travels along the entire inner part of the hotel. The restaurant on the bottom floor in the courtyard (Patio del Nispero) is just awesome. Pumpkin fritters, crusted salmon, Flan Brulee.........completely original and awesome. The food is cutting edge. Altho, i will say, El Picoteo (the tapas restaurant on the 2nd floor, rents the hotel space) has better Pina Coladas. After our meal, we asked to see the restaurant manager so we could tell him how much we enjoyed our meal; he was unavailable at the time, however, the next morning, slipped under our door was a hand written card from the restaurant manager (i forget his name) thanking us for how much we enjoyed our dining experience (try getting that in the states) and 2 coupons for free sangrias (which were awesome). Every one at the hotel was incredibly hospitable. My wife and I were enjoying a bottle of wine at the table outside of our room when a hotel employee walked by........without even making eye contact, he offers us an ice bucket for our wine (which is not his job btw), we accept, then he goes and brings us an ice bucket and stashes our bottle of wine in it immediately. The rooms: the terracotta tile was very authentic. The room was very comfortable and not cramped at all, the fridge was fully stocked with bottled water which you could replenish for free at the honor bar at any time (oh btw, there's an HONOR BAR). What's more is that there is a privacy door between your room and the door to the hallway....so any noise from the courtyard at night was basically blocked and reduced to white noise akin to your A/C running or a ceiling fan, if anything at all. The first night, i woke up 3 times but went back to sleep b/c i didn't see any light AT ALL and thought it was the middle of the night. Turns out, the shutters and the curtains don't let in ANY light....so my body was right....it was telling me to get up b/c it was 10 am.....but pitch black in our room (which i found very pleasant). El Picoteo is a very nice place to eat, and is equal to and in many cases much better than the restaurants around town. It's a bit pricey, but u get what u pay for. Garlic shrimp were truly jumbo shrimp and worth $14 for 5 of them. BTW, a lot of the restaurants in OSJ are a bit pricey, so whatever, if u stay at el convento, don't be afraid to enjoy their dinning. There is a pizza joint w/craft brews on the 2nd floor too. Didn't go there, but they have a nice little selection of craft brews.....surprisingly, a lot from North Coast Brewery.... Oh, how about this....the staff knows who you are. Several times, my wife and I were sitting somewhere on the premises and a member of the staff whom we'd never even seen before would come by and address us by our names....i don't care how they know who we are, to me, it says that they care about their guests. Beautiful rooftop with a nice view of the sunset over the harbor. The pool is small, but i'm not going on vacay to do laps, so who cares. Finally, one of the best parts (which really got our evening started) was the free happy hour from 6-7 every night. We fully took advantage of this. I'm not gonna say the wine was awesome, but it was ok and it was free. 7 diff varieties. 4 Reds from Spain. A white from cali, a white from spain and a sparkling rose......plus plenty of cheese and fruit to satiate your appetite. meunster, bleu cheese, brie, reggiano, cream cheese w/chives, it was nice. Drink a bottle of wine and listen to the coquis while sitting on the patio watching the sun go down, compliments of the hotel, that was great. To sum up my very long review (sorry), i wouldn't ever stay anywhere else in old san juan (just b/c of how amazing this place is) and i would almost go back JUST to stay there again, b/c it's worth the trip alone. Not to mention, it's located right in the heart of old san juan. Oh also (i can't shutup) there's a guy singing and playing guitar in the plaza in front of the hotel, its very pleasant and he's very good. You can have your beach front mega resort, i'll take the 500 yr old piece of history with the best of everything all in one place. If you stay here, you will not regret it, unless you're a horrible person, i guarantee it. Bottom Line: i'm going here again, and i don't think i'm leaving the premises.

Flight delay! The night we supposed to arrive in San Jaun, we instead, were put up by the airline (AA) at the Miami Internation Airport Hotel(never stay there! gross!) and phoned El Convento at about 10pm to tell them we would be a day late. To our great relief we were assured that we would not be charged for the missed night. We also called the car rental agency that night and even though we would have the car for one less day, they charged us $100.00 more for changing the reservation so late. Our long awaited and well planned vacation was falling apart. We decided things couldn't get any worse so had high hopes for the hotel. We arrived at Hotel El Convento in the rain, a day late after flight delays, parked our rental car along the street, handed the keys to the valet and went to check in. The desk clerk was quick to check us in and answer a few questions and by the time we turned around, our bags were waiting for us. Our room was ready even though we were early and we went right up. Our room was a good size with a nice bathroom, great view and noise was not an issue. That night we had supper at El Picoteo in the hotel. The atmosphere was wonderful and the wait staff excellent. I had the Grouper Civiche which had just right texture and terrific flavour. I also had the Paella which was way too salty, or at least the rice was, so I picked out all the seafood and meat and ate that as it was still pretty good. When the waiter came to clear the plate, he saw what was left and inquired, I explained about the saltiness and he offered anything else on the menu in a hurry but I was fairly full so we just shared a dessert. The Paella did not appear on the bill even though I ate all the good stuff. Again I was quite happy. When we asked for our car it always appeared in a very reasonable time and all the staff were very happy and courteous when ever we needed them While almost all the reviews I have read here are glowing, a couple were not and can only chalk it up to people who are unwilling to accept that a building contructed in 1646 might have some flaws.

Second,the housekeeping and cleanliness was excellent. Everything was in great shape, very clean, and the decor was amazing with an old world charm and feel. Third, the location was perfect for us. We could go out in many directions from this hotel and explore all of San Juan, the forts, have great shopping, great places to eat (would recommend Pirilo for excellent tapas and Marmalade for excellent upscale food and experience, and St. Germain bistro for great fresh, delicious food). Fourth, the grouds and atmosphere were so romantic and beautiful. The courtyard, verandahs, eating areas, lobby, hallways, everything was so intimate, romantic, and welcoming. Beautiful. Fifth, the food. Well, it was great to set and drink sangria, but I do have to admit we had better food elsewhere. But, if you are tired it is right there and great for a close option. The reception they do with wines and cheeses was such a great touch. It was nice after a day of walking to relax with some wine and small food while experiencing the beautiful scenes and sounds of old San Juan. I read complaints about the construction. It was ongoing while we were there too, but hey, improvement is an important thing! However, I did notice they never started before 10 am and finished in late afternoon - the times people are usually away. I thought that was very considerate. I also read about not sleeping due to noise? I'm not sure where that room was. Ours was on the third floor and we slept so soundly and the room was so dark, we found ourselves not even waking up until 10 in the morning and we never do that!

I wish I had paid better attention to a previous review that noted how noisy this room is. It's the only room on any floor that is adjacent to (and actually wraps around) the elevator. The constant noise of the elevator in operation was enough to awake us many throughout the night. Thankfully we were able to switch to another room for the following two nights. Also, no safe in that room. And the room looks out onto the patios, so you can't really leave the windows open if you want a little privacy. The bedrooms were very nice, but the bathrooms were more of at a 2-diamond level than a 4-diamond level. The bathrooms in both rooms that we occupied looked like they had recently been painted by a blind person (no offense to the blind). Quite a sloppy job with paint brushed onto all surrounding surfaces. Sounds nitpicky, but not something I'd expect in a high end hotel.

It is a charming hotel with character and history and we felt as though we had been transported back into time from the moment we stepped into its rustic lobby. Location The hotel has a marvellous location, right in the heart of Old San Juan and almost all restaurants/ places of interest are at a walking distance. This was a big plus for us.We could walk around exploring the entire island until afternoon and come back to the hotel, take a power nap, go down for the lovely wine and cheese reception/ guzzle some Mojitos at El-Picoteo before we set out on our night-time expeditions!There's a beautiful church right across the street and a charming little shop (Poets Passage- be sure to visit both the stores in Old San Juan, you will fall in love with them). One night, there was a guy playing Spanish guitar just outside the hotel and it was simply surreal to sit on the hotel stairs under the stars and listen to him play. Rooms The hotel manager very kindly upgraded us to a Queen Vista(From our original Queen Deluxe) on the third floor. The room had beautiful Spanish furniture and a louver door and looked exactly like the picture on the hotel website. Unfortunately the view outside wasn't great, as it overlooked onto neighbouring houses but on the upside, there was ample sunshine and if we tried really hard, we could see the San Juan bay in the distance! The flat-screen TV in the room was quite neat. Ditto for the toiletries in the bathroom (Aveda if memory serves). The bathroom was quite basic, it had a bath-tub but was a tad small and its rusticity took a little getting used to (but its part of the package, I guess). The room was conveniently located as the swimming pool/jacuzzi is on the third floor too, so we could easily pop over anytime we felt like. Outside each room, in the lobby, there is small table with 2 chairs that overlooks the courtyard (Around which the hotel is built and where the lovely old nispero tree is)- perfect spot for a morning cup of tea! Staff The hotel staff is very courteous and helpful. They were prompt in responding to our requests/ queries and have a range of ideas/tours to help you plan your stay. We really wanted to go for this wonderful Bio-bay tour, but unfortunately we were too late in informing them and all the seats were booked. If you do plan to take any of the tours, it would be a good idea to book as early as you can. Other Old San Juan doesn't really have any beaches, but you can use the beach club facilites at the El Convento's sister hotel for a nominal charge (You might want to keep an entire day for that). The hotel restaurants are great and not overtly expensive. We loved the pizza at Pizza e Birra and the ambience of Patio del Nespiro (in the shady main courtyard). The staff also recommended great restaurants - Bar\u00c3\u00ba, DragonFly (The duck nachos are to die for),Parrot Club,San Juan Cafe. At night time, the quaint historic San Juan of the day turns into a lively Spanish-Carribean town with thriving night-life. Whether you want a quite romantic meal or an eventful night out, there is a plethora of options to choose from.

They weren't looking for excessive tips, as they were quick to leave you after their duties were fulfilled. They were pleasant and caring to say the least. The room was beautiful with windows (no screens) that opened to overlook this ancient gem of a city. The interior balconies/hallways overlook a beautiful garden & various restaurants. The hotel itself speaks volumes for what was once (and still is) the epicenter of the Caribbean. The nightly wine event/meet & greet is great, but anything but wine will cost you (we paid $6/Medalla) which is charged to your room. This matters not, since the atmosphere of this hotel is breathtaking. It's not beach front, but you're literally a 5 minute walk from the ocean. There is a small pool and jacuzzi on the roof with ample seating that is a spectacular bonus to an otherwise gridlocked city-esque locale. We ate at the Tapas restaurant on site which was wonderful, albeit slow as far as service is concerned. The bill was reasonable, but the island time service lives up to it's name here (maybe they were short-staffed or uber-busy). Regardless, the surroundings are second to none since you are dining within the open & vast walls of the hotel (Coquis are abound here within an enclosed oasis which is El Convento). The hotel was a convent in the 1500's and has since been restored. We had a perfect & calming view of the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista (c. 1521) which is the oldest standing cathedral in the U.S. & it's relevant possessions. It also houses the tomb of Juan Ponce de Leon who was the 1st governor of PR and the Spanish settler responsible for naming Florida, USA. So, yeah....this hotel is that great. I picked this hotel due to the #1 ranking for hotels in PR and we weren't disappointed. This is THE place to stay while frequenting Old San Juan. I just wished we had the following day to explore. The hotel, staff and interior grounds are perfect and deserve a 2-night stay minimum to explore the city and this historic hotel.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cperfect location, interesting history, lovely courtyard\u201d", "Author": "SaZimTanz", "ReviewID": "UR123919303", "Content": "This storied hotel is the perfect place from which to explore Old San Juan -- you step right into it, avoid the parking problems if you are driving in, etc. Sophisticated shops and restaurants blend in with the beautifully restored buildings and historical relics.

El Convento was the choice based on TA reports (#1) and location. It seemed like the perfect choice. In general we enjoyed our 2 night stay at the hotel but have to be honest regarding some disappointments we experienced. ~Booking. We booked a queen vista to insure nice bay views and had a request for room 508 which is a corner room and according to reviews has a bit more space. We booked directly with the hotel and reservation staff were helpful. We booked in October for late Dec. 2011. At no time were we informed about the construction taking place in the central courtyard. For sure it was going on because the project is very massive. That was our first disappointment that we had to learn of this on TA. I contacted the hotel and got various information indicating it was no big deal. Finally after more comments on TA I contacted the general manager who confirmed the situation and shortly after our email exchange the hotel decided to offer the breakfast coupons as compensation for any perceived inconvenience. That seemed fair but only complaint driven...probably should have been in place sooner. I do see they now have some small print on the website about the construction. A few days ago it was a pop up which certainly grabbed more attention. As it is placed now you need to really look for it. Most communication in advance of arrival with the hotel was email as phones to individual departments were not answered, messages left with no return call. Emails were answered with 2-3 day delay and usually after 2 emails. ~Upon arrival we carried our bags up the steps with no bellman in sight. Check in was efficient and we were upgraded to the Pablo Casals Suite. We loved the suite and felt very fortunate to be staying in this historic hotel and room. It was quiet (even on New Year's Eve) and very private in a corner off the reception area on floor 3. I did notice room 302 (a reviewer had been \"upgraded\" to this room and it is right on the public area with zero privacy if you want to open the drapes/blinds in the room. I would not want that room. Did not see any other rooms. ~Staff had recommended and made reservations at Marmalade Restaurant and it was a good choice. Since it was for New Year's Eve and I did follow up. It was not done by the first person I made sure it was taken care of by the second person I spoke with. ~Service. As we only stayed 2 nights the only experience with daily maid service was the one day and we were gone touring the whole day...upon our return hoping to shower/relax etc. we found no service to the suite. We called and they came shortly to clean the suite. Disappointing. ~Wine reception. This was very nice...only made it one night. Its a nice idea for sure and of course well attended. ~Terrace on third floor and Pool area on fourth floor. Very nice views...small plunge pool. Visited a couple of times just for the views but area was not well maintained and many used glasses/wine bottles/towels scattered all over. Clearly you would have to clean your own space. Disappointing. ~Restaurants. We did eat in El Picoteo and it was very good. The \"coupon\" breakfast was served in some sort of meeting room with all windows covered so you would not see the construction in the courtyard. The buffet was standard fare with the best choice being the hot station with made to order items. Service was excellent from the hostess to the server. We did not try Patio del Nispero as there was no patio. ~Check out. This is a busy place. There was only one person behind the desk and a line for check out. I would suggest that bills with so many extra charges require extra time to check out and between 11-12 staffing should be appropriate. I did notice some clear mistakes on my bill which she corrected. After getting home I did notice that the actual room rate was not correct and we did get that fixed. There were a number of people in line that did not have a clue on the \"resort fee\" which is very high. Make sure you understand what the room REALLY costs to avoid shock at checkout. While I am happy we chose El Convento, the property at the present time is over-priced. I do note that they are offering some midweek specials and I would suggest that is the best time to visit. Between the tourists in for a \"quick look\" who can with a very slow elevator(acessed with room key) easily make their way up to the third and fourth floor and the weddings (some may enjoy this) it is not a quiet place. Music (awful stuff) blares from the restaurants of the hotel into the courtyard. Maybe midweek you could avoid the weddings? We did not encounter this. I do think that once the construction is finished (more than a few weeks off I'm sure) and the courtyard is restored to its former grandeur it will be a great place to stay. In these Spanish buildings the courtyard is so important and honestly reading a sign telling you how \"it used to be\" and how \"beautiful it will be\" is disappointing. Thanks to my research we went in with proper expectations and there was very little actual pounding until the day we left. I think management was slow to deal with the situation and when I read \"huilhan 1's\" review indicating that the \"coupon breakfast\" offer was suspended for San Sebastian festival I simply could not believe it. In my experience when a hotel is undergoing construction the smartest thing is inform each client as they book and offer some sort of discount on room rate ie 15% would be acceptable. The offer made by El Convento is okay but should not be randomly pulled when a \"street fair\" happens which in fact causes more headaches for most visitors that did not come specifically for it!! I wanted to give El Convento a much higher rating but just could not. We moved on to another property just down the street for the last two nights in OSJ and found a much better option. El Convento is a good choice for the best location and historical value. Rooms are unique. Go midweek...be specific on room and understand the \"quirks\" of the hotel including outside noise. Read the reviews. I don't like giving an average review to a property that upgraded me to a beautiful suite but I had to be honest. Just my opinions.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201c24 Hours in Old San Juan\u201d", "Author": "travelfans29", "ReviewID": "UR123381362", "Content": "Our stay at the El Convento was not planned; rather it was made on a whim based on the advice of a friend we made at the W Hotel in Vieques. Though we had originally intended to stay all four nights in Vieques, this friend told us that our first trip to Puerto Rico would not be complete without visiting Old San Juan. And, we were told, no visit to Old San Juan would be complete without staying at the El Convento. Based on this advice, we cancelled our last night at the W and flew back to San Juan one day early. We were not disappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this hotel definitely lives up to its #1 Trip Advisor ranking. We were ecstatic to learn that we would be catching the last day of the San Sebastian festival. We received a courtesy call from the El Convento warning us of the traffic; we thought this was really considerate. Not fearing adventure and having experienced countless Mardi Gras in New Orleans, we felt prepared for the crowds and looked forward to catching some authentic Puerto Rican culture. As a lover of architecture, I was immediately impressed upon arrival by the El Convento\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stucco archways, elaborate woodwork, and colorful tiles. Though filled with modern amenities and fixtures, the construction is the old-world type that is too expensive to build anymore. Our Queen Superior room was right off the pool deck on the 4th floor. It was a standard size with all of the amenities you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a four-star hotel: large LCD television, marble and tile bathroom with quality fixtures, solid antique furniture. What set the room apart were the working double French doors that opened to the street scene below. Some of our best cityscape pictures were taken from this window. After checking in, we were pleased to learn that Old San Juan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best rated pizza restaurant, Pizza E Birra, was located across the hotel courtyard. The pizza was above average; what set the restaurant apart was the central location and cool vibe. We ate lunch and then caught some live Puerto Rican music in the El Convento\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s courtyard. We then headed up to the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception on the 3rd floor. Whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying on a normal day or festival weekend like we were, I highly recommend stopping by the evening manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception. Water, coffee and wine, as well as light hors d'oeuvres were complimentary (at other times of the day, I believe the same selection is available on an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honor bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd system). We met some interesting people preparing to leave for a cruise and traded travel stories. Before heading out to the crowded streets of the festival, we watched the sunset on the 4th floor pool deck. Because the El Convento is taller than the surrounding buildings and because the Port of San Juan is several miles wide, there is a clear line of sight to the sun setting over the Cordillera mountains. It was beautiful. After having been at the hotel for nearly two hours and not yet left the premises, we were ready to venture out to the festival. Because this review is of the El Convento, I will not get into much detail regarding the San Sebastian festival or Old San Juan. San Sebastian can best be described as Mardi Gras in New Orleans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 French Quarter without the beads or bare breasts. Crowds similarly walk up and down the streets, beer or beverage of choice in hand, listening to numerous live music stages and/or shopping at various art stands. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up for a party and willing to indulge in some different culture, I highly recommend it. Old San Juan itself is also a lot like the Spanish influenced French Quarter\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the buildings are actually about 150+ years older. Think tight, cobblestone streets, stucco buildings, French doors with balconies overlooking the streets. From the El Convento, all of Old San Juan can easily be covered by foot. The peninsula slopes upward to the north, but the incline is not too bad if you are up for a little exercise. With only three hours to tour on Monday morning, we were able to check out \u00e2\u20ac\u00aaFort San Felipe del Morro, the San Juan Gate (Red Door), the Paseo de la Princesa (near the cruise ships), and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. I recommend all of these sites. Whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re leaving for a cruise, or the islands, or in town for an extended stay, I highly recommend visiting Old San Juan.

We were dropped off at the side of the road by a taxi at 3pm. There was no doorman so we had to carry our own bags around the side of the building and in to the hotel. The check-in experience was good but there was no offer of help with our bags to our room. I do not expect to pay top-level prices for a suite in a luxury hotel where the assumption is that I will be the one carrying my bags to my room. The lift is clearly in need of help. There is a single tiny lift, which is the slowest I have ever come across. Whenever my wife took the lift and I walked up the stairs, even after negotiating the locked gates between floors, I walked to the other end of the building to our room before my wife had managed to travel the two floors in the lift. The room itself is very nicely furnished and of a good size, although the bathroom was tiny at around 5ft x 7ft. The suite has no views and just overlooks the brick walls of the buildings opposite. There was a good, easy to use coffee machine, with plenty of coffee bags and the fridge is re-stocked with water on a daily basis. Oddly, half of the small wardrobe in the bedroom is taken up by the fridge and coffee machine. Guests have to walk from the bedroom through the lounge into another kitchenette to access the main wardrobe. I could not understand why the fridge and coffee machine is not placed in the kitchenette where there is also a sink, worktops and plug sockets, thus allowing guests access to the whole of the bedroom wardrobe.

There is a small town park located right outside the hotel where a local oil painter sells his wares for about 20$ of scences of puerto rico that are quite nice. Across the street there is a catholic church that we attended for Christmas eve services.

We tried one of the restaurants and two of the bar areas while there. The most fun was the honor bar, which has a veranda associated with it. We hung out there for quite a while and met some other guests, one of whom we ended up going to dinner with that evening. Very cozy. The pool is TINY and located on the roof. It is very pretty and has a lot of charm, but this is not a pool that would lend to rowdy play and probably not for children at all. I would classify this pool as a \"plunge pool.\" It's barely larger than my spa at home. If you got 8 or 10 people in there all at once, you'd become close friends.

We stayed at the Hotel El Convento, which was great. It is a small, historic hotel in the middle of the Old City. If you are looking for a generic luxury hotel resort, this may not be the place for you. We loved it because it felt very special and unique. The building is beautiful and interesting, the pool deck is very relaxing, and the service is great. They offer free wifi, free coffee, tea, and bottled water throughout the day, and a really nice complimentary wine and cheese happy hour every evening from 6-7. Several reviewers here mentioned that they are currently performing construction on the courtyard, which is true. They told us when we checked in that the renovations were supposed to be finished before the holiday season but they got behind schedule, so to make up for it, they gave us coupons for complimentary breakfast buffet for every day we were there. The breakfast buffet was very good (included an omelet station) and we thought this gesture more than made up for the minor inconvenience of the courtyard renovation. One problem we had: we started out in room 324. On first glance, this is a really nice room...very big with a really high ceiling. It is across a very narrow street from a very noisy bar (El Batey), however we realized that if we turned the air conditioner up high, the noise from the fan drowned out the noise from the bar and it was ok (not great, but ok). However, one night (Wednesday) we came home and there was a HUGE party at the pizza place downstairs (Pizza e Birra). Music was BLASTING and there must have been a few hundred people there. We asked at the front desk and they told us that the party happens every Wednesday night, and that it was going to last until 2AM. There was just no way we would be able to sleep with that noise. The front desk people were very nice and understanding, and they offered to let us change rooms, which we did (into a much smaller but much quieter room which we were happy with). So if you will be there on a Wednesday night, make sure you are not in room 324. It really was terrible.

This hotel was probably one of the best luxury hotels I have ever stayed at, due to it's staff, location, and the price we paid. The hotel is located very close to SoFo, El Morro, and the cruise ship terminal. The rooms are comfortable, with Aveda products, free water, and sound proof inner doors that keep the cool in and the sound out. Our room, 516, had a view of the ocean and Old San Juan. Our bed was comfortable, and the room was very quiet, even with the construction going on in the courtyard. The wine and cheese reception at 6pm each night was great. They offer four white and four red Spanish wines. The cheese was plentiful, and there is an honor bar should you not want wine or the complimentary coffee, tea, and water that are available all day. Sure, the pool and hot tub are rather small (although we did fit 13 people in the hot tub one night) but the hotel makes up for that lack in a big way. El Convento has relationships with La Concha and Courtyard Marriott Isla Verde. We chose to go to La Concha in Condado, due to the restaurants and activities that would be close by the hotel. La Concha is beautiful, with three pools (one is adult only) and a nice beach. The waves were pretty wild, as it is on the Atlantic, so be careful with children in the waves. The pools were uncrowded, with waterfalls and palm trees. You can charge anything you want back to your room at El Convento. We rented a car and parked in at the hotel's lot, which is right across the street behind the church. The rate was 20/day, with unlimited in and out privileges. The valets and luggage porters were very nice, friendly, and full of recommendations of where to go and what to do. We ate at Patio del Nispero for breakfast (which is inside due to construction) and El Picoteo for dinner. Both were on the expensive side for the quality and amount of food received. The service was also quite slow at Patio del Nispero, but we were on vacation so we didn't really mind. The hotel is beautiful, with lots of old Spanish class. From the piano player in the Salon, to local candies at reception, to turn down service, we felt well taken care of and pampered.

Luggage in tow each time, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall the name of our bellman but he was so gracious about the whole thing. Our room was clean and cool with a view out onto the plaza / square.

The wine reception each day (6-7pm) was a lovely gesture and easy transition into the evening. An opportunity to meet other guests and travelers which we did and shared our stories and made new connections. The hotel was situated in a perfect spot to explore the city and enjoy walks each night to take advantage of the photographic opportunities. Whilst staying there we also had access to 2 other beaches / hotels. One of which that we did take advantage of was La Concha / Renaissance at Condado beach. This is such a tropical beautiful place, from the laid back pool and waterfall to the architecture in general and of course the beach. I was only there one time but really wanted to return to fully appreciate the place. The hotel provided towels and lounger for the beach which is great, the beach is clean and has the shade of palm trees if desired. One other highlight of the hotel was an employee / server named Ruben who was a joy to be around; he was so kind to us not only with his young persona and advice but great drinks. He offered recommendations at the hotel restaurant and bar as well as the San Juan area in general, he is a great asset to both the hotel and the travel industry of Puerto Rico in general.

There is a great wine and cheese reception where the libations keep flowing and they never run out of tasty cheese and fruit. The open air plan and Spanish architecture will also win your heart. If I ever go back to San Juan, I would stay here and nowhere else. The two drawbacks are: no beach and the pool is a small plung pool. My travel partner and I only stayed one night at the end of a trip that had involved more than enough beach so I didn't mind. But the hotel has relationships with others right on the beach and a shuttle to take you there, so it's hardly a drawback.

We stayed here for a couple of nights post cruise and overall I would stay it was a good stay. We arrived early and as our room wasn't available - neither was the porter - so with the help of our taxi driver we dragged our luggage into the reception area and we were told it would be stored until our return and we set off to explore the city. We were told that we wouldn't be able to access our room before 3pm but we arrived back just after 2pm and were checked into Room 504. We were happy enough with our room, we had a super view of the pool area and the sea beyond although the room was in a fairly noisy location close to the lift and we seemed to be staying in the midst of a wedding party. We were told by front desk that our luggage would be sent up to the room so we went to get some coffee (which is available 24hrs) from the lounge on the 3rd floor and decided to check in for our flights on the computers that were available for us to use there and chill for a while. When we returned to our room, probably an hour and a half later our luggage still hadn't been delivered - we rang the front desk and it soon arrived - I'm not sure if they didn't pass on the original message to deliver the bags or what happened. Tha managers daily cheese and wine reception is a great event which is well attended and we found that the charming hostess was kept busy replenishing both the cheese & biscuits and the good quality wines throughout the hour that the event is held. The downside of our room became apparent during the night - I think that the lift machinary was located on the roof near to our room so there was a clanging and thumping noise every time the lift was in use throughout the night. We didn't bother to request a change of room as we were only here for two nights, however if we were to visit San Juan again, we would certainly request a room further from the lift area but then we probably wouldn't have had such a great view - decisions, descisions....! On the morning of our departure we called for someone to help us down with the bags and the phone just rang and rang - we had checked the night before if somone would be available at 8am and were assured it wouldn't be a problem. Eventually the phone was picked up and somone did arrive to help us - however it wasn't the porter as we were told that he hadn't turned up for work on time! Maybe we were just unlucky but our experiences with the porter service in this hotel were not good and this is not really the standard of service we expected in this class of hotel.

The bathroom is tiny with little room for toiletries. The El Picoleto restaurant at the hotel was a huge disappointment. We ordered various tapas. Half were eatable; the rest over salted, over an undercooked. The flamenco show was a joke. Dancing was of the kindergarten quality. Once we had breakfast at the Patio del Nispero. Great service and a beautiful courtyard! Menu is limited and overpriced. Better places to have breakfast are within few blocks (e.g La Bombonera.) We were interested in walking tour. The hotel recommended a local guide (believe his name was David.) Although a colorful personality, he knew very little history and embellish a lot of facts. This tour was definitely not worth the $40. If you like wine and cheese, the manager's reception is worth attending. Unfortunately, the available sitting is a bit limited. Guests tend to linger. So, arrived early. If you worry about you health after eating all the delicious PR food, use the gym in the basement of the hotel. They have a few treadmills, an elliptical, a stair master, and a set of weights. All are in excellent condition. I don't think they see much use. Our room had a fridge. The staff always stocked it with bottled water. Grab additional water on the 3rd floor patio. We were a bit worried about driving and parking in the old city. Thankfully, there is a designated valet parking lot just across from the entrance. It is very convenient and easy to find. Parking costs $20 a day. Is the El Convento perfect? May be not.

It was also nice that our room had a \"sound proofing\" door within which seemed to buffer out construction noise going on in the courtyard.

The reception area, courtyard and banquet room are stunning and private. The rooftop pool is small but welcoming in the hot afternoon sun. Service is subtle and unassuming. The restaurant could use a bit more staff but is made up for by the self-service honor bar and nightly open-bar Manager's Reception, which is not to be missed.

It's a cab ride to the beach from the hotel, so if that bothers you stay at La Concha instead.

Our high hopes about El Convento from other TripAdvisor gurus made us wonder if the hotel could be as great as described, and if we would enjoy it that much. We did! I won't repeat all that others have raved about (charm, cleanliness, high level of service, wine and cheese reception) but will add a couple of other thoughts. We have enjoyed tapas in Spain and can say with confidence that El Convento's El Picoteo rivals the best. The portion sizes are extremely generous and the dishes we tried were exceptional. We ate a second night at El Convento when our daytrip to El Yunque/Luquillo Beach/the Bio Bay at Fajardo (all fabulous and recommended) didn't get us back to the hotel until almost eleven at night. Too tired to go anywhere else, we enjoyed delicious thin-crust pizzas, tomato/mozzarella salads and hearty red wine in the outdoor plaza at Pizza e Birra -- perfect! On Sunday the staff proved why it is consistently complimented on its excellent service. Three of the four of us wanted spa treatments, (my husband wanted to chill by the hotel pool) but the spa within walking distance that they usually recommend was closed. Instead, after some searching, the front desk staff found La Marina, a new spa (open since September 2010) near the port where the cruise ships come in. We took a short taxi there, but hopped on the free city trolley to come back -- just three blocks walk from La Marina. Not only was La Marina clean, and the staff there wonderful, but the quality of our massages was high and they extended a 15% discount to us as El Convento guests! Sauna, cups of tea, ambient music, highly skilled massage therapists... and a break in the already reasonable price added up to a joyful experience. We couldn't have found La Marina on our own. Another reviewer mentioned his unhappiness at the fact that we lost power for about twelve hours during our stay, from about midnight until about noon. The rooms remained relatively cool but a bit stuffy. I heard through the hotel grapevine that although El Convento has a small generator, enough to keep the kitchen and public spaces going with lights and fans, that they won't have a larger generator in place until 2012. We woke up that morning, still without power, and decided to take advantage of El Convento's sister resort: La Concha in Condado. Gorgeous! Four pools, a generous sandy beach with attentive cocktail service, more good food on the pool deck by Solero restaurant, clean changing facilities, fun staff -- we loved our day at La Concha and appreciated that we could access every amenity as if we were hotel guests there. All you need to do is ask El Convento for a letter introducing you as their guests to the La Concha concierge. Another sister resort option is the Marriott in Isla Verde (we didn't have a free day to try it). Overall, we can confidently add our voices to the chorus praising El Convento for being a generous, elegant, unique place to stay. Those who value character and charm will find this hotel sparks a trip back in time in the middle of Old San Juan.

Me and my wife stayed here during the beginning and end of our honeymoon. Two nights at the beginning and one night at the end. El Convento is a beautiful hotel. Perfect location in Old San Juan. Close to everything, but also very close to the edge of town near the water, so at times it is also peaceful. Everything about the property is beautiful, from the rooms to the courtyard to the verandas, ect. Keep in mind that this is a very old building and a convent as well. The rooms are small (I've stayed in standard hotels in NYC with bigger rooms), but they have all the proper amenities that you would expect with an upscale hotel: nice towels, bedding, frig, nice TV (although if you're staying here you shouldn't be watching any TV). We ended up staying in the same room for both of our stays, even though our last night was supposed to be in a cheaper room. We appreciate this, although I was curious as to what the non ocean view rooms looked like, just to see if it was worth the extra money. The wine and cheese hour exceeded my expectations. I've stayed at places in CA wine country that only offered 2-3 wines, El Convento offered 8 wines and 5 cheeses, all very good. OK, now for the bad part and why I'm only giving them a 3. First the construction noise. I realize that this is an old building and in need of upkeep, but at times the noise from the construction in the court yard was quite annoying. My biggest issue though was with the last night we spent here. I had considered writing a separate review and giving them a 1 for this. The electricity went out at around midnight on Oct. 16, and remained out until sometime the next morning. In small rooms such as these, with little ventilation, and in Puerto Rico in Oct., air conditioning is a must. To keep it short, the night was miserable. One of the worst nights I've ever spent in a hotel. I realize that it is not the fault of the hotel's management that this happened, and certainly would not expect them to just create electricity so that we could have some AC. However, the quality of my stay is ultimately the responsibility of the management. There was not even an apology from the staff. I think the correct response from the hotel in this situation would have been to offer everyone in the hotel that night a voucher to be used at a future date. I think this is the least they could have done and would have encouraged people to come back and enjoy what the hotel really had to offer such as was the case on our first stay.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carol Stream, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cPerfect, Perfect, Perfect\u201d", "Author": "buffywell", "ReviewID": "UR119326006", "Content": "Hotel El Convento is a Puerto Rican jewel!

Room is lovely, especially the sheets and pillows; but honestly,It's not very neat and convenient. Given the fact that the whole building haven't been changed much since built, we can accept that.

From Monte Carlo to the China Sea and have found few hotels that truly encapsulate the essence of their surroundings. The Old City of San Juan is honestly a destination of rich history and pure culture. The resonance of French, Spanish and Dutch settlements throughout this islands history bloom beautifully on each rustic cobble stone street. One can feel, while strolling through the streets, the energy of history past. Each edifice tells a story, and every road leads you to a new adventure. From some of the oldest buildings in America, to the incredible array of impeccable cuisine, bustling nightlife and some of the most loving peoples I have encountered in my travels, Puerto Rico and specifically Old San Juan is the definitive destination for any traveler. That being said, El Convento Hotel epitomizes the lifeblood of all these sentiments. My Fiance and I experienced this property this September and from the moment we drove down the narrow street, opening up to this incredibly restored convent, we were memorized. The hotel itself is quite spacious, five stories high and stands ever present caddy corner to a beautiful little old world park. Immediately i felt taken back to Spain in the 1800's. The Bellmen greeted us with a warm \"bienvendio\" and ushered us to the entrance where you are instantly struck by the incredible art and architecture. The entirety of the hotel is covered and created of original art from all over south and Latin America. You feel as though you are ancient Spanish royalty as you walk through the courtyards towards the concierge, who again, smiles with incredible sincerity. Our concierge told us a brief history of the convent, the local flora and fauna on the property and all that was at our finger tips. Our room was everything I could expect of, from staying in a Spanish villa, complete with mountainesque views of the ocean and port of San Juan. One can imagine what it was like to live here in the convent in the 18th century. It was breathtaking! Our room was perfect size, set with with time period - esq furniture mixed beautifully with the technology of today. Flat screen, Digital output, Wifi, Marble bath and complete with sound proof glass doors! Remarkable dinning options await you within the hotel as well, from traditional Latin American cuisine, to stone and brick oven pizza, a foodies heaven! They even had an herb garden where you can grab what you like and utilize in your cuisine or if daring incorporate at their spa. Every staff member was impeccable, with warmth and sincerity toward their Island. A true gift for any traveler. The courtyards, terraces, nooks, sun decks with all transport you and give you the freedom to time travel. We were even provided with a greeting in the room that had the General managers, Efrain, whom we had the pleasure of meeting later on, telephone number. He was a gracious host and incredibly knowledgeable. IMPECCABLE. This property is over 350 years old, has the best staff and management i have encountered in a long while and will undoubtedly leave an impression on both my fiance and I. If you are planning any vacation to the Caribbean, don't even think twice. Puerto Rico and EL Convento are on the bucket list.

All three restaurants are very good, but I do encourage you to venture out and eat around OSJ. Some advice if you are staying here: The nightlife seems to have moved from San Sebastian to near the cruise ship ports. Two years ago there was live salsa on San Sebastian every night. One of the bars we went to last time is now a restaurant, another had karaoke. Thursday and Saturday we ended up at Latin Roots with about half of the city. We went to El Nuyroican and had a great time on Friday. There were very few tourists at either place and we had a blast. (again, this was the off season, so maybe the locals take over during this time, not sure). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at either place though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c food we saw did not look appetizing and there is some amazing food in OSJ.

Location is wonderful- right in the heart of Old San Juan. Steps away from shopping, walking distance to the forts, parks, and restaurants. When we got to our Queen Vista room, we noticed that the view was more of the rooftops than of the water. It was a nice room, but really nothing that special. It was average-sized and the bed was comfortable. The floor felt sticky- perhaps a combination of the wax on the floor and the humidity? There were no slippers provided and only a small area rug, so you had to wear your shoes at all times. The bathroom was on the smaller side and could use some good TLC. A sad, little wilted flower was in a bud vase when we checked in- probably about three days past its prime. It was still there when we checked out four days later. There was a small glass shelf over the sink, but there was really no room to place your toiletries, as it was filled with other things. Some hardware fell off the shelf on the first day. Although, I did not call housekeeping to fix it, it was still in the same place when we left. Perhaps, the most irritating thing was that the lip to the walk-in shower was not tall enough to keep the water inside (no tub). By the time you finished your shower, there was a large puddle on the floor outside of the shower. You had to keep the towels on the floor so that you didn't stand in water. Also, there was only a soap dish in the shower, so not a lot of room for shampoo/conditioner, etc... There is about an 18% \"Resort Fee\" added to the rooms. I think this is applied to the wine/cheese reception, wifi, and beach club. Since the hotel is not close to the water, you can go to the sister resort and use the beach there. However, unless you take a cab or rent a car, there is no way to get there. Since the beach club is something the hotel talks up, it would be a good idea for the hotel to help you get there. Perhaps a bus/mini-van with scheduled trips or even taxi vouchers? This would probably pay dividends in customer satisfaction, like the wine and cheese reception. The beach club is not really a value if it's going to cost you $50 round trip to get there. There is an honor bar on a separate floor that stayed pretty well-stocked and free coffee/tea. There are plenty of places to sit outside to enjoy the weather. A small plunge pool that was popular given that the hotel is not beach side. Three restaurants to choose from, depending on your appetite. This hotel is THE place for weddings in San Juan, with a wedding each night we stayed. It can probably get loud, but we were on a high floor so we did not really hear any noise from the activity. However, the first floor and lobby are always very busy. El Convento is also open to everyone- tourists, weddings, restaurants. I like the fact that you need to use your key to move between floors as it keeps out non-hotel patrons. The reason we didn't rate this hotel with three stars was because of the history of the property and their exceptional staff. All front desk staff and valets we encountered at this hotel was courteous, professional, and hospitable. It was evident they liked working there. The bartenders were exceptional! When we arrived to the hotel, our room was not ready, so we asked for recommendations to go to lunch as we wanted some authentic Puerto Rican food. They gave us several recommendations that were very good. ALL requests and questions were met with a smile and a 110% effort, which was very impressive. We would stay here again if we were to go to Old San Juan and we would definitely recommend this hotel to friends.

However, the customer service when something went wrong was aweful. I arrived a few days after the hurricane, so the electricity was out. I'm a fairly easy going person so I didn't mind dealing with the flashlights and candles. What I didn't like was that on check in, they had told me that I would get about $40 compensation for the lack of electricity. Expedia would be credited the money, and expedia would credit me. I don't really care about the $40 since it's not really worth my time to be on the phone (especially on hold) with both the hotel and expedia. It's just the principle of the matter that if you promise something, it should be done. So when I checked in, they told me to call expedia about it, which I spent the first hour of my vacation doing. Weeks after my vacation I expected to see some kind of credit on my credit card statment, but when I didn't, I called expedia and the hotel. After a lot of back and forth between the two, and several hours on the phone, the hotel basically said that they weren't going to give me any compensation for that day because the electricity ended up coming back on around 10pm that night (regardless of the fact that the electricity was out for most of the day and night). Their explanation was that despite the fact that the electricity was out for the day and evening, since it came back on before midnight, that they wouldn't compensate me for that night. Let me tell you, it's very hard to get ready for dinner with only candles and flightlights. That brings me to another issue. I had called down and asked for flashlights and candles and someone told me they would be brought up. We left the hotel for a walk and expected them to be there when we got back an hour later. When they weren't still there, we called and asked again and we told that someone would bring them. Eventually, we had to go down ourselves and get them. I didn't complain about it at the time, but when I explained this to the manager on the phone weeks later, she was kind of rude and said that I needed to understand that everyone that night had to come down and get candles/flashlights. If that was the case, then I really wish they hadn't told me several times that they would be brought to my room. I would have been happy to go down and get them myself the first time I called about it. I don't like that the management seems to be ok with unfulfilled promises. I didn't need to go through the trouble of trying to get some kind of compensation if they weren't going to fulfill it anyway. To me, the wasted time on the phone wasn't worth the promise of $40.

I scoured the San Juan hotels on the beaches and every other review of those places alternated with great and terrible. So those all raised one thought: inconsistent. Having been to San Juan before, I wanted to stay some place where Old San Juan was walking distance. And with my daughter, it had to have a small gym. El Convento came up over and over again, as having consistent charm, service, nice rooms, great location, and a small gym. Not on the beach but with a beach club that would allow you to access the beautiful San Juan beaches and large pools but go back to Old San Juan for the evening. It is all the great things people said about it. No loud \"ugly Americans\", or whatever loudmouths you look out for to avoid, as opposed to the big places. The hotel is impressive, beautiful, well cared for and comfortable. Rooms and beds are very nice and well maintained. Aveda products in the bathrooms. The third floor library with its water, coffee and tea always there, and the honor bar during most of the day and evening were terrific. The inner courtyard (the hotel is open air completely) has a 300 year old orange tree and the little tree frogs sing their coqui sound. The manager's happy hour was lovely. The little plunge pool and jacuzzi with lounges and umbrellas very relaxing and with a pretty good view. The three restaurants were quite good and for Old San Juan, not bad prices. We just loved it. Also used the refrigerator for the extra food from a couple of dinners and had cold food for lunches. Perfect. The tapas place was good, the main restaurant was good for breakfast and lunch (didn't have dinner in either) and the pizza and beer place was great for a small dinner after a bigger lunch (and the bartender befriended my 21 year old daughter and showed her around, being nothing more or less than a friendly local, nothing underhanded at all). In fact, everyone was just warm and friendly and nice. My daughter also found the bar down the street, El Batey, filled with locals, including her new friend, and really enjoyed that til all hours, right up from the hotel. A lot safer than the casino bars and discos. Old San Juan had a food and drink festival the weekend we were there so the streets were packed and the food and drink flowed. I liked it that most of the people participating seemed to be locals too as they spoke Spanish. Lots of locals in old San Juan, families during the day, showing the forts to their kids. They take a lot of pride in their city, and their country (I know it's officially the US but feels separate in many ways). El Convento was so convenient to walk all around Old San Juan and really explore it. There is valet parking though there is also a parking garage not too far away, but I used the valet parking. Turned out I didn't need a car really but we did use it to go to La Concha to use the beach, beautiful beach, great service but glad I wasn't staying there in the end. Only things I could wish for: the honor bar and hotel bar to stay open longer. Also know that Old San Juan closes down pretty early except on weekends, except a few bars. Over all, even with a few little things that could have been fixed, not worth mentioning, it was terrific. Marmalade and the Parrot Club both good too. Take pictures with the bird man if he's there, in the plaza Colon. Also note a lot of cats but all very healthy looking due to the cat sanctuary on the island. Very clean and friendly too, no fleas! There are some mosquitoes as expected but not too bad. It does get pretty humid but there is also a nice breeze quite often. If you are using gps: note that the street for El Convento IS in gps but it's not El Cristo, it's Santo Cristo and it's in Antigua San Juan (at least in my Garmin). It took forever to find that and I'm not sure how I did but occasional street signs do name the street calle de Santo Cristo, as often as calle de Cristo. The streets are TINY so I'd recommend a small car unless you know you need a 4 wheel drive. It will take you a while to get out and into town, so take your time. I will definitely go back there. Oh nice little gym by the way and no one there but me. Decent elliptical, two treadmills, a stair climber, bike, free weights and a little weight machine. Kept nice and cool. It was wonderful. But only if you don't want casino, beach right there or big pool, bar that stays open and disco. If you want quiet, culture and a taste of years gone by, I highly recommend it.

Once the porter was there, he was charming and eager to inform us of the different facilities and amenities available to us. The lady at the front desk was pleasant and helpful.

Their beautiful sung- mass on Sunday morning could be heard on the street. The hotel faces a pretty grassy area which had very good street entertainers both nights. The hotel is simply lovely. The rooms surround an open courtyard with charming tables and chairs on the large balconies that serve as the halls in front of the rooms. The room and bathroom were small but adequate, as I would expect in a boutique hotel. They were spotlessly clean. The room was furnished in Spanish antiques/reproductions. They supplied a cold empty (yea) refrigerator and safe. There was a glass airlock door inside the room which made it possible to keep it at a comfortable temperature in spite of being such a old building. (Thank you!) As advertised they have a plunge pool. Think of it a \"cool\" hot tub, which is excellent for the warm climate, instead of a swimming pool. The best amenity was the honor bar in a pleasant room attached to a room with internet-connected computers/printers and an outdoor space. It was nice to be able to access liquor, wines, beer, and soft drinks without going through room service or one of the restaurants. We were out of the hotel during the Manager's Reception, but they had a beautiful setting. We dined on tapas and enjoyed flamenco dancers in the tapas bar attached to the hotel on the first night. It was so nice after traveling all day to have good food and entertainment without having to go out. We ordered breakfast from room service. The charge was comparable to that of a 4 or 5 star hotel. The service was excellent. I was surprised at the quality of the food, though. It was not up to par with what I would expect of this hotel. I was impressed by the security of the hotel. Being open to restaurants downstairs, it was nice that you needed your key to access the elevator to the rooms and pool. I wish I could have given this hotel 5 stars because of its location, service, amenities, and appearance. However, I do have two warnings for future travelers. On the first morning we went down to wait for our limo driver. He was not the one from the previous evening so we did not know what he looked like. There were men inside the hotel's entrance who confused and harassed us about their identities and the competence of the company we had hired. I was shocked the hotel would allow this behavior in the entrance hall in full view of the desk. My other concern was I paid well over 900 dollars for 2 nights in a queen vista room. The vista consisted of a view of dirty unappealing rooftops, a partial view of the bay and the industrial area across the bay. I questioned whether the bed was a queen; it felt much more like a double.

Next the cons: - As mentioned above, the fact that this is such an old building and an old convent is really neat and part of the reason I chose this hotel, but you have to continue to remind yourself of this during your stay. I felt as though they did not highlight the history of the building enough. - The gates at every floor- if you leave your key with your husband by accident ... forget it!

I know it is for security, but it seemed more of an inconvenience than anything. - The terrace patio was a nice thought, but they missed the mark- there is no view what-so-ever of this beautiful city from anywhere on the property.

The food was DELICIOUS! in the courtyard they served the best latte's and the Tapa's bar had a buzz of it's own, a wonderful array of food and spirits with gorgeous waiters to wait on you. The hotel offers complimentary wine and cheese in the evening..... an absolutely wonderful selection of both, there is nothing average about this hotel and their accomodations. The people at the front desk couldn't have been more gracious and accomodating. Lovely atmosphere in every way. There is a tiny pool on the roof, there is a nice view of the city as well as the ability to hear the singing mass ( on Sunday's) at the histoically old Catholic church which is located right next to the hotel. I don't think that the location could be any better....a lovely well appointment hotel filled with history, beauty, and charm. However don't expect any grand veiws from your room. All the warmth and ambience lives within the courtyard and restaurant. I would return to old San Juan just to stay at this hotel. We were treated like VIP's. Shopping, that is good shopping, is just a stones throw from the hotel, the church across the street and the old Fort is just a couple of blocks up the street. This is a MUST experience if you travel to San Juan, Puerto Rico, even if it's just for a meal, eat in the courtyard. Fabulous food and service and hospitality in every way.

What a gorgeous hotel with wonderful staff (very friendly, and helpful), excellent location and beautiful and well-appointed rooms, with really comfortable beds. The hotel itself just exudes history, and what a fabulous location to be in OSJ. Everything is in walk-distance (except a true beach) and the wine/cheese reception every evening was a very nice and classy touch at a classy hotel. They have complementary bottled water also (this was a great perk for my mom and I because we are used to drinking several liters of water a day). 2 computers for guests' use and free wifi. This hotel had it all. Dont go expecting a beach resort though, and the pool on the rooftop is very small. We ate at all 3 restaurants and found them to be pricey (except for Pizza e Birra, which was very reasonable and good value) and to have exceptional service. I would have given this hotel 5/5 if it were not for the 2 weddings that occurred on the property over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday nights). The guests were outside late into the night on Sunday, and as our room was on the first floor (101) facing the street and the front of the hotel, we could hear the noise from outside as I guess they went into town for an after-party. We also found that Saturday a few of the guests were staying in the room next to ours, and were going in and out of their room every half an hour or so (perhaps to have some drinks or whatnot, dont see why you'd go in and out of your room otherwise), which I found really annoying and it made it difficult to sleep. I think the hotel should enforce quietness better when they have wedding parties on the property that go on til all hours of the night. That was my only complaint, but it was relatively minor.

The enclosure helps eliminate noise from the hallway and interior courtyard and also hold the air conditioned cool air inside. A few hints: Driving in Old San Juan and especially parking can be difficult. Avoid arriving and leaving during prime traffic hours... the streets are narrow and jammed and can be steep with cobblestones with limited parallel spaces. There is a parking lot at the cathedral across the street for hotel guests for $20/ night... which is very easy and convenient. Plan to explore Old San Juan in the morning and evening to avoid the heat. Wear comfortable walking shoes for the cobblestones and ancient pathways surrounding the city walls and forts.

The complimentary wine and cheese reception was very nice with good cheese, crackers, grapes, and wine. They also had free coffee and bottled water available 24 hours if you wanted to get a mallorca or other pastry and bring it back to the hotel for breakfast. The main negative is Picoteo, the tapas bar, had very weak mojitos and was very overpriced. We ended up spending about $80 for the weak mojitos, some chorizo and olives, 5 shrimp, and 4 croquettes.

(Ok, the bell hop neglected to get our rollaway, but the rest of the staff more than made up for this feau pax. Thus 4.8 stars) IMPORTANT TIP: Do not try to check in Sunday afternoon through early Monday morning, because this hotel is just 2-3 blocks from the \"festival\" area which is absolutely choked with traffic and many of the 1.5-car wide roads are closed or impassable. During this party period, parking regulations and driving laws are pretty much suspended. \"Don't hit the other guy\" is the only driving law during festival. If you get caught in the traffic circle, expect 2 to 3 hours to get back out (a distance of 1.5 miles). LOCAL INSIDER ADVICE: El Convento has the best \"mohito\" on the island! Even if you don't stay at the hotel, you must pop in to the courtyard bar for their amazing bartending skill. BEST BREAKFAST \"SECRET\": Make a point to have a leisurely breakfast in this quaint courtyard setting. The crepes were to die for, and if THIS isn't an indicator: These were the best pancakes I've tried anywhere in 6 countries! (My son convinced this skeptic.) WHAT TO SEE: The Fort is just 3 blocks away. Plan 2 to 3 hours to truly appreciate the amazing engineering applied in the 1800s to this Spanish-built fort.

James was referred to us and he was the absolute best. We told him what we were interested in and he designed a private tour for us at a reasonable price, he also added a few things! I thought I had lost my camera on our full day of adventure! Nope, James found it in his van and and brought it to me at the hotel. Ask the front desk about James for a private tour! Don't miss the rainforest, fort and market in San Juan. The park close to the hotel has entertainment some nights and area families are out and about walking and enjoying life! The hotel was beyond expectations if you like older and history! It made me feel like I stepped back in time as the rich generous wood that adorned the halls (which are open air) are everywhere. The courtyard is so nice and sitting there was a favorite of ours. Just sitting around at night listening to the tiny frogs. The wine and cheese is really a nice touch in the evening and the pool area is great. We ate at the pizza restaurant there very late one night and their pizza was excellent and nicely priced for San Juan. We enjoyed St. Germaines Restaurant down the street for salads and healthy beverages. The Old Harbor Restaurant down by the ocean is a nice walk and has great lobster and calamari. We titled our trip \"The Best of Both Worlds\" our choice was of course, El Convento (4 nights), the old world and Caribe Hilton (4 nights) on the ocean the new world! Great choices!

Rooms were smallish, but comfortable and well appointed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pretty marble bath, nice furniture. We were on the fourth floor and had a view overlooking San Juan harbor (and some rooftops). A soundproof door to block out the sounds of the restaurants on the lower floors is a nice touch. The rooftop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with plunge pool, heated whirlpool, lounge chairs and umbrellas, was a wonderful place to read and relax. Beautiful open-air courtyard and arcades. The daily 6 pm wine and cheese hour on the veranda overlooking the churge and park is also a nice touch. I would stay here again, but I have the following observations: 1. A hotel of this caliber should have a full time, professional concierge. The young women behind the desk were all very nice, but somewhat inexperienced. One botched a reservation we had made for a tour; no problem, we just rescheduled it for the next day, but it would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a shame if it had been our last day. 2. At this price point, the hotel should bundle breakfast in with the room rate (although we did enjoy going to La Bombonara most mornings), and/or offer a more economical means of using their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach club\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (privileges to use the beach, pool, etc. at La Concha in the Condado, and Marriott Courtyard in Isla Verde). Public bus was an option, but seemed like a major schlep. So we ended up taking taxis, at $35-$45 RT, w/tip. With so many other guests using this privilege, why not offer a shuttle service (either free or at much lower cost)? 3. El Convento should reconsider the drivers and tour companies they use. On the day our tour was messed up, it was nearly impossible to get a rental car, so we decided suck it up and hire a driver (@$50/hour) to go to Guavate (a town in the Cordillera Central that is known for its roast suckling pig, aka lechon), and also hoping to see some mountain vistas we had read about in Frommers and elsewhere. We were given a very affable young fellow, but he drove a really beat up old taxi (with tinted windows, not great for sightseeing). The place he took us to in Guavate had wonderful Lechon, but other than that, he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know where to take us and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of a guide. The next day we went on our tour. There was only one other couple going, so the tour company decided to hire an independent driver. The driver was clearly knowledgeable and drove a relatively new Lincoln Navigator (this was the type of driver and car we had hoped to get for $50/hr on the previous day). Unfortunately the tour felt rushed and both we and the other couple felt that it was not worth the money. Also, when we booked the tour, we were told by the hotel that we could pay by credit card. The driver told us that it would be very difficult to pay by credit card since he was not directly affiliated with the company. He pretty much insisted on cash and actually drove us to an ATM. He also said that cash would be best since he would not have to pay taxes!!!!

That being said, we would absolutely stay here again. We saw a few other small hotels here but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come close to El Convento which is probably why they can get away with what they charge. We would probably opt for a suite next time just to have some more space and probably a better view. If you can afford it or if you happen to come across a sale of some kind, stay here.

I booked a standard queen room, but we were upgraded to the 'Bridal Suite' which was HUGE and had a balcony. There is a very small pool on the roof and tables and chairs on a large third-floor balcony overlooking the town, where complimentary wine and cheeses are served in the evenings. Bottled water is available free of charge at any time. A small library area includes two computers with very fast, free internet. I was a little worried that it would be noisy in the room, since the surrounding traffic is heavy on a Sunday, but once we closed the doors on the balcony it was dead quiet and we slept really well. I have stayed in the Condado area of San Juan and much prefer being in Old San Juan.

El Morro is within walking distance of the hotel, and should not be missed. El Convento is also adjacent to the Cathedral which is well worth a visit.

We chose El Convento due to its location, the description on its website, its status as a member of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small Luxury Hotels of the World\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and reviews on TA. All of these factors, including the nightly rate, created expectations of a wonderful end to our vacation. Most were met or exceeded; those around service were not. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location in the heart of Old San Juan was unparalleled. The building preserved its unique character as a former convent, and the beauty of the public rooms was readily apparent. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor, furnishings, and warmth of the interior was lovely. The wine reception was a welcome offering, and the pool, small but attractive. The rooms (we were in a queen deluxe room, city view, #314) were perfectly charming. There was some mold in the caulking of the bathtub, some mosquito squash marks, and two dead cockroaches, but nothing to cause much concern. The bed linens and bed itself were deliciously comfortable, although on the small size. Note, it is a European queen bed, not as wide as American queens, but again, this did not cause concern. The flat screen TV, the small refrigerator with complimentary bottled water, bath products (Aveda), reading lamps, room safe, black-out shutters, large desk, and most of all, the separate door into the bedroom from the hallway (to insulate from noise) were excellent features, all as one would expect of a hotel in the category of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Small Luxury Hotels of the World\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Where the hotel disappointed was in the service attitude and behavior of some staff. It was especially disheartening as this is the one thing - unlike the building, noise or location - a hotel has complete control over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how its staff treat guests. Often the right words were spoken but not backed up by any perceived sincerity or action. A couple examples: we had asked for early check-in when we made our reservation, repeated in a separate email 11 days before arrival. On our arrival before 10 am, we were greeted on reception by Chamil. She would not tell us which room was ours (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153the rooms are not assigned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) so we could not keep an eye on its status, but had our bags stored (as is customary in every hotel) and asked for our cell number so she could call the moment our room was ready. After waiting in the hotel for two hours (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, your room is not ready, we have your cell and will call you right away when it is\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not sure how she knew this as the rooms were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not assigned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), we left to sightsee in our rather warm travel clothes. Finally, we returned to the hotel at 3 pm having now waited for 5 hours, and discovered our room was ready. We had been killing time, waiting for the call that never came. No apology or acknowledgment that she had not called us was forthcoming. We then asked to see a couple rooms in our category (queen deluxe), but were shown a room on the 2nd floor that was clearly in a lower category (no louvered windows with Juliet balcony) and our assigned room. We chose our room, and waited for our bags from storage. We sat in the room and did more waiting and waiting. Finally we went down to retrieve the bags ourselves. Instead of an apology which was not only called for but simple and would immediately have been accepted, Ivan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s condescending response to us was that we were in Puerto Rico and why were we uptight, we should just chill out and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just relax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! We were speechless. The room was air conditioned, but although the thermostat has settings up to 76\u00c2\u00b0, no heat is available, resulting in a quest for a blanket. After 4 calm requests, we finally received the blanket. Unlike Raymond, Nathan did have the grace to apologize sincerely, and it was sincerely accepted. El Convento\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website states that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has set new standards of luxury, comfort and service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Although it is a lovely hotel in an exceptional location, and its rooms are comfortable, compared with other hotels we have stayed in in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153luxury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd category it does not measure up let alone set a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new standard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We are pleasant, respectful and courteous guests, and we felt that none of our service issues were of sufficient magnitude to warrant calling a manager, but we remain disappointed that on the little issues where some staff could easily have chosen to take the high road and uphold the service standards the hotel promises and the image it promotes, they fell down. Given the nightly rate ($376 inc taxes), delightful staff (Nathan, Neisha, Angel) did not quite compensate for the failings of the others.

I do not recommend the hotel. I chose the property because I wanted a first class hotel located in historic Old San Juan, and because I had memories of glowing reviews of the property from many years ago. Boy, were those reviews outdated. We stayed in the Pablo Casals Suite, with a very large living room separated by a door from a large bedroom. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charge for the suite was $920 a night. The suite is located over the entrance to the convent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chapel, and so is separated from the main body of the convent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cloisters. Since the door does not open to the central courtyard, it is insulated from any noise generated by the restaurant located in that courtyard. Unfortunately, the door opens to a fairly dimly lit stairway, making the entrance to the room somewhat unappealing. The living room had a desk and chair and then a sitting area with 2 armchairs and a sleeper sofa. The bedroom had a king sized bed, with a separate sofa. There was a single bath, with one sink and a tub/shower combo. Lighting in the living room was generally decent (although it did suffer from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153part fluorescent, part incandescent lighting problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an unseemly mix of white and yellow light), although the sitting area was not adequately lit (only one lamp \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they need a second floor lamp to adequately light that area). The bedroom was well lit. The towels, linens and bedding were of good quality. The master king bed was comfortable, but the sofa bed was one of the poorest our son has experienced. He reported he was tempted to sleep on the floor. There were separate air conditioner controls in each room. The air conditioners worked well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit the bedroom thermostat seemed to require a setting of about 65 degrees to actually get the bedroom to 70 degrees. So, what went wrong? Three things, mainly. First, the room was in dire need of refurbishment. The pictures (showing wear and tear on a lampshade, the gaps in the front window, wall markings and stains and ceiling water damage) demonstrate just a fraction of the wear and tear evident everywhere in the room. In addition to the flaws evident from the pictures, there were additional wall markings where the walls had been damaged, on the desk lamp, the solder holding the shade to the lamp had broken on one side (which is why the lampshade is askew in the picture), the curtains (lacking, in the bedroom, any pulls to assist in closing them) had been partially separated from the curtain rings, and, even when closed, the bedroom balcony doors let in the street noise from outside due to inadequate sealing. The room had a musty, mildewy smell (I had hoped it would go away during our stay, but it did not). The robe hook in the bathroom had separated from its mounting (all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed is an Allen wrench, for heaven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake), such that it could be turned 360 degrees (thus rendering it useless as a hook) Second, lack of adequate cleaning. There was a golf ball sized wad of black electrical tape on the stairs to the entrance to our room (poorly lit, as noted above) upon arrival. That stayed on the stairs throughout the stay. Consistent with the remains of the tape, those stairs had clearly not been vacuumed in some time. In the bathroom, on the floor at our arrival was a fingernail sized piece of orange peel (how could housekeeping miss something that bright?). The glass end table on my side of the bed had a series of water stains from the drinking glasses of the prior guest (yuck!). All these made me terrified of what else I would find if I looked closer, so I stopped looking. Third, significant service failures. There were no washcloths in the room on arrival. We called down, and three were delivered to the room. The next day, housekeeping (i) took two of the three washcloths, leaving one used washcloth and (ii) provided no new washcloths and (iii) left one dirty towel. As we left for dinner, I interrupted the desk clerk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal call (she was gracious enough to ask her friend to wait while she attended to us) to ask for 3 washcloths. When we returned from dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no washcloths. So, my wife called down again to ask for washcloths. Seventy minutes later \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no washcloths. At that point, I took advantage of the personal cell phone numbers of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management which had been given us at check in, and called the General Services Manager at home to ask for our washcloths. She was appropriately appalled, and apologized (and offered appropriate accommodation). Our washcloths showed up within ten minutes. But the damage had already been done. Alas, the next day housekeeping took all our washcloths and left us with only one new one. On all three nights, turndown showed up at the room at 5:45pm. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way too early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it should happen when the guest is at dinner, so that the guest is not interrupted. During our second day, housekeeping was still in our room at 3:45pm when we returned from our day. We went outside to wait for her to finish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when she left, I thanked her in Spanish and got an offhand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ok\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in response. What kind of response is that? From the other reviews on Tripadvisor, perhaps the cleaning/room condition failings of the Pablo Casals Suite are not shared by other rooms, because clearly the hotel has impressed other guests, and particularly other guests with significant review history on Tripadvisor. However, at $920 per night, the types of failings we experienced are inexcusable. Frankly, they make me question how a property can have such problems and still be a member of Small Luxury Hotels.

I was surprised to find the room was not as small as I had expected (based on other travelers' reviews) but again, we live in the Northeast and are accustomed to NYC-size hotel rooms, and our room was larger than expected. It even had a beautiful little private patio with a table and chairs- perfect for having morning coffee- and another unexpected plus. I do recommend asking for a room on the first or second floor, as these seem to have the high ceiling (ours was on the second floor and the ceiling was quite high). We also loved all the cats around the hotel and surrounding neighborhood. We very much enjoyed our dinner at Triana- a Spanish-style restaurant just across the square from the hotel. The sangria and flamenco dancing (as well as the food) were fantastic. Another highlight of our trip. We took advantage of the nightly wine and cheese on the terrace- what a lovely way to begin the evening. The wines were good and the cheese selection was also quite nice. The honor bar was also quite handy- a little pricey as compared to the market, but the convenience can't be beat.

We talked to the girl at the desk and she said someone would take a look. That afternoon when we returned to the room it seemed a little better. I think the main problem was the unit cuts off when you leave the room and gets hot again. My wife said it would cut off every time I left the room and she had to get up and move around for it to kick back on. This was the only hic-up we had. We decided that if it was still warm the last night we would check-out and find somewhere else, but we made do. The hotel is very nice. As noted, the rooms are very small. In retrospect we should have stayed in a less expensive room since the view was not worth the extra money we paid for he Queen Vista room. We ate at 2 of the restaurants. The first night we ate at the Tapas restaurant and it was good, but very expensive. The Tapas are small and the recommend 2 plates for each customer. By the time we finished it was quite expensive.

I booked for me and my GF but we broke up just before the trip, so I went alone. The place is very nice, clean and attractive. I paid $22 with tip for a taxi from the airport. There are taxi fee schedules for different zones. It was raining when I got there, but it soon cleared up and was perfect for the rest of my trip. Check in was smooth and quick. I got a second floor room (queen deluxe) with high ceiling, but it seemed the third floor and higher would have been better because of view and access to pool, wine/cheese happy hour and internet room. The whole of Old San Juan was dead, virtually no one out at bars and restaurants. No cruise ships coming in to port the whole time. Even come Friday night, the few folks out were small, couples on vacation and locals who seemed to keep distant from the tourists. It is not like there are dance places and local action all night long as portrayed in the tourist books. I went to the local supermarket a few blocks away and bought beer and liquor. I did not buy drinks out (way overpriced). I checked out several of the local recommended restaurants and they were pretty much all fine. I got a deal for the hotel where I had a $25 food and beverage credit for each day. The breakfast in the patio each morning was great. That is the only meal I ate at the hotel (less than $20 to fill you up; eggs benedict great as was yogurt and granola). I did not even use my whole FB credit up. Dinner and the food at the other restaurant upstairs seem pricey ($16 for ceviche!!). Between breakfast and free wine/cheese happy hour, I could have spent no extra money on food (but I did because I am a food lover). I checked out and used El Convento's sister properties. La Concha was nice, very populated with a younger and older crowd using the pools, beach and bar. It cost me 75 cents to get there by bus in 20 minutes. Find the bus terminal in Old San Juan and save $20 on taxi. Really though, if I was going to a caribbean island to hang on a beach, I think there are better islands. Casino is small and small time, and drinks at the bar $$$$. I also checked out Courtyard by Marriott in Isle Verde. Would skip. Loud planes every ten minutes, setting off car alarms, not a pretty place. Neither Condado nor Isle Verde are pretty (the towns). If you stay only at your hotel, I guess it is ok, but I like to explore. Old San Juan is a pretty place and interesting, but again, it was deads-ville when I was there. About El Convento, this place is so special (see my Mohonk review for what is special), if I was looking for a romantic place to bring a date for a few nights, you cannot go wrong. As a single guy whose GF bailed, it was still nice but lonely. There were many couples here, and they all seemed to be very happy. Love was in the air. This is not a hotel for a single guy but if you are single, it is still nice. There were no obvious local chicks to meet and bring back to the hotel. The locals are very distant from the tourists. The pool is small but I used it a lot, was very hot and great for cooling off. Open 24 hours. I went up one night at 2AM to swim and interrupted a could having fun LOL. It turned out all good. The business center/room, 3rd floor, has two computers with free internet access to check in to your flight and print your boarding pass. I checked out restaurants and other stuff I read prior to coming here to remind me what to do. The hotel has a very nice staff and good value when you look for a deal and contact them directly. I did not like the many bums I saw around Old San Juan. Disturbing diseased persons that needed medical attention and I would think the city would want to help the folks and remove them from the eyes of visitors. The free trolly system too is nice, but I noticed locals take it to get where they need to go, so that was a bit weird, but understandable. Check out the historic sites and the forts. It's nice. I will not likely to go back to PR, but I was glad I picked El Convento as were the other guests I talked with. I have so many other places to see, PR is done, I am a single guy looking for more fun places where I can meet local single females and have that kind of fun (like the DR, Costa Rica, Cuba and Thailand for example). My friends tell me that the west part of PR is the place to go. Small towns, good surf, not overwhelmed by tourism. If I were going back to the caribbean to enjoy an island feel and tropical island, PR is not the place to go. And where is all this dancing and stuff till all hours of the night going on??

We were returning to New Orleans after a week at the W Vieques and wanted to break up the return trip and check out all that Old San Juan has to offer. The hotel lifted its two night minimum requirement when we called about three weeks prior to our visit. I highly suggest looking into this as an option if you are committed to staying at El Convento, but only require one night. Hotel El Convento lives up to the superior service that is the hallmark of the \"Small Luxury Hotels of the World\" brand. No detail is overlooked, you are never a bother, and, should an error be made, it is literally corrected within minutes. We were so pleased with the service, we couldn't stop talking about it! From our arrival wherein the front desk clerk asked us how our trip to Vieques was (the hotel must keep booking notes) to the beautiful turn down service and timely wake up call/ taxi booking, we were impressed from start to finish. The staff is obviously well-trained, and it is a first class operation. The main areas of the hotel, including the courtyard, are quite charming and well-maintained. If you admire preservation and a sense of real history in a place, this would be a great spot for you. However, if you are looking for gleamingly fresh/clean/modern interiors, I would look elsewhere. The whole feel of the space is very European. El Convento reminded me of a five star hotel in Europe, but a three-four star boutique hotel in the US. Our room, 518, was perfectly suited to our needs, particularly considering the $185.00 price tag. However, it was a bit shabby, with the chairs and table in the room needing a thorough cleaning and replacement of fabric. The ceilings were fairly low and the flat screen TV was fuzzy. It just seemed a bit \"worn.\" That being said, the bathroom was fully renovated and quite clean. It almost didn't match the interior of the room b/c it was so modern and fresh, with every amenity offered, including Aveda products. The room directly faced a maintenance closet filled with mops and housekeeping supplies (instead of the interior courtyard view of a majority of the rooms on the floor) and had a window view of a neighbor's ramshackle back deck. Again, we were not bothered by this for the price, but it should be noted. It seems that the rooms on the second floor of the hotel do not present these issues as they have high ceilings and more of a street view. We did not try the restaurants at the hotel, opting to dine at Marmalade instead. We enjoyed drinks, however, at the tapas restaurant in the afternoon. They were delicious and the service was friendly and efficient. We took advantage of the complimentary wine and cheese hour, which is a lovely detail offered by the hotel. The small balcony faced the square across the street from the hotel, with beautiful views of the church. There was not a ton of seating, though, especially about twenty-thirty minutes into the hour, so definitely keep that in mind if you must sit and if you are with a group of two or more people. I highly recommend El Convento and cannot imagine another hotel in Old San Juan living up to the high standard of service set by it. The location and main areas of the facility are top notch, particularly if you are interested in staying in a historic property. Pay attention to the view described when you are selecting a room over the phone with the hotel and definitely ask about the ceiling height for an optimal experience.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indialantic, Florida, USA", "Title": "\u201cLoved this Place, should have stayed much longer!\u201d", "Author": "Douglasvblair", "ReviewID": "UR83586205", "Content": "The staff was great, since we had no concrete plans and we had woke up to late for the bus tour the staff took the extra time and effort to try and find us a motorcycle rental company and when they couldn't they got us a rental car delivered to the hotel, all while we waited in the room.

I never got the impression that we were \"annoying\" the front desk by asking for questions, advice, or help, and because of the small exclusive size of El Convento, several of the staff members knew us by name by the end of our trip. Before booking, I was concerned that we would regret not choosing a beachside hotel. It was actually quite the opposite. Because of the beach club access, my boyfriend and I utilized La Concha, but we were always glad to get away from that more commercialized side of San Juan and return to our charming little luxury hotel.

The friendly staff, stellar location and gorgeous rooms give is a 4.5 stars. HOTEL: Open-air feel with an interior courtyard. Several restaurants and small cafes within the hotel. Feels small even though it's quite large. Old world charm. Modern design. Fast wifi and free for guests. ROOM: We had a double room on the second floor, room 207. The room itself was gorgeous. 20 ft ceilings, dark wood beams, old world decor. The bathroom is tight, especially given the spaciousness of the room itself. Ours had a juliet balcony facing the courtyard. Clean and very comfortable beds. We did have an issue with the AC. It was constantly stuck on below 65 degrees no matter what the needle actually said but given the high humidity and the very very warm weather of Puerto Rico, it was a blessing. We just used extra blankets at night. AMENITIES: Pool - The one negative was the pool. It's located on the roof deck is the size of a child's wading pool. Fortunately the hotel has a partnership with both the Marriott and the La Concha located about 15 min away on the beach. We choose to visit the La Concha and make use of their pool and beachside access. The La Concha is absolutely beautiful and perfect for travelers looking for a tropical resort feel. It was two pools, one an infinity pool overlooking the beach. We chose the Hotel El Convento because we were specifically looking for an old world, local experience. Restaurant - The hotel has at least 3 restaurants. We chose to sample the Spanish Tapas Restaurant. I suggest you skip in-hotel dining and venture out for tasty authentic fare. The tapas was adequate but nothing special and most dishes were fried or lacking in flavor. Excursions - The hotel originally booked us a biobay tour but we found out that we could book one at half the cost. The hotel quoted us $95pp but if you book it directly, it's only $45pp. We cancelled with the hotel with no penalty and booked it ourselves. The biobay is a can't-miss excursion in PR. Other - The hotel also offers a wine reception from 6-7pm. Don't miss it. It's absolutely fabulous with a different wine tasting each night and fruits and cheeses (delicious!) available for munching. You get to meet other guests and enjoy the 3rd floor terrace. Water and coffee is free at all hours on the 3rd floor. LOCATION: Perfect for those wanting a true San Juan PR experience. Located in the heart of Old San Juan. Close to shops and several very good restaurants. Try El Bombonero for a dining experience you'll crave when you return home. Get a Majorca sandwich (sweet crispy pastry) filled with ham and cheese there. The Cafe Berlin is also close by. Go there for a great mofongo, a classic PR dish! Nightlife surrounds the hotel. PR residents don't start the party until after midnight so make sure to have some of the (very good and free) coffee the hotel offers. The hotel is close to the historical castle fort. It's an enjoyable walkable distance. Overall, we had an extremely positive experience. We loved the Hotel El Convento.

The small business center has access to 2 computers & printers which came in handy when looking for activities & for booking our return flight.

We got the room for an excellent price ($150/night) by booking directly from the hotel's website (I love a bargain!!!) and I can see why their regular rates are usually much higher, it's worth it! On 2 occasions we spent some time at their sister hotel, La Concha to use the pool & beach access. The property was beautiful, trendy and a great place to relax. The crowd was very mixed & we even made some new friends there, but the pools are a lot smaller than they appear to be on the website. There wasn't enough outdoor lounge space to accompany the amount of people they cater to and it got even more crowded when they closed down the beach front pools for a private party.

I can't say enough positive things about the hotel: the staff, its location, and the hotel itself were above and beyond what we were hoping for. The hotel is located in downtown Old San Juan, right across the street from the oldest church in the Western Hemisphere. (Do yourself a favor and look up the history of the El Convento -- when it was originally built in the 1500s, it was a convent for nuns!) Everything in Old San Juan is walkable from El Convento, and I can't tell you how great it was to be able to stop by our hotel to drop stuff off, take a quick break, etc. Location grade: A+ The staff were also outstanding. One of the people at the front desk gave us a great recommendation for a restaurant (see my review of Marmalade for details), and even made the reservation for us. When we came back, she asked how it went and was genuinely interested to hear about our experience. Tony, our waiter both mornings when we had breakfast at the hotel, also deserves special mention. He was terrific! Staff grade: A+ As for the hotel itself, you will find yourself in awe -- not necessarily because of how \"nice\" it is, but due to its uniqueness. There simply isn't another hotel comparable to El Convento. I mean, how many hotels have a library or an herb garden? The El Convento has both! It's small (about 60 rooms total) but not \"bed and breakfast\" small, which means that the staff will recognize you after a day or so. This is one example where the pictures on the hotel's official website gives you a sense of what the hotel is really like, so I advise you to look there. The rooms are a bit small (especially the bathrooms) but are very well-appointed. You get Aveda bath products, which my wife tells me is a good thing. I recommend you splurge for the \"Vista\" rooms for a better view. Room grade: B+ Overall, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The El Convento will truly make your Puerto Rico vacation better. (Oh, and by the way -- check out the fitness center on the bottom floor.

I seek out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name). LOCATION: Great, in the heart of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold San Juan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Area is quiet but a far walk to where the good restaurants are if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raining (5 mins). BEST WAY TO GET THERE: Taxi fare from airport is fixed at $19 + $1 per large suitcase. TYPE OF ROOM: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Standard. BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Bed was comfortable, pillows were down and a bit on the thick side for our preference. Sheets were of high quality. LIGHTING: Good in bedroom & bathroom. BATHROOM/SHOWER: Tiny bathroom and no decent sized shelf to put toiletries. 2 people in one bathroom at the same time would be difficult. Shower is in tub and 50% of the spray came out the bathtub nozzle as opposed to the shower head. Water pressure was weak as a result. TOILETRIES: Aveda. Good stuff. CLEANLINESS: Room is dirty. Lost a contact lens on the floor and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the amount of filth in the room. Outside of room was also very dirty. Dishes were left out in common areas and bird poop is all over the railings and it was clear they have been there for a long time. A/C: Worked very well and was quiet in the lowest setting. STYLE OF ROOM: Nothing special. Looked better on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. COMMON AREA: Nice with all of the trees outside This is the real reason to stay here. Unfortunately it was very dirty. Lobby area is nice but nothing special. New tiles replaced old tiles in the floors and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match the color. This hotel lacks attention to detail. QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Room was quiet when the second door in the bedroom was closed. There is an outside looking door between the bed and the door to the hallway. This probably to reduce sound of people in the bar. Morning sunlight could be blocked. FOOD: Only had breakfast here because it they cant get this right we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give them a chance for dinner. Pancakes had no flavor and French toast were average. TV/INTERNET: Internet (wired & wireless) is at no charge and was fast. SERVICE: Not good. People everywhere but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean. The free wine and cheese (btw- not free as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the $30/day resort fee) was nearly cleared out 20 minutes before the time it was supposed to end. Staff was not very helpful and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out of their way for anything. SUMMARY: This hotel is just ok. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect much but know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still the best option for a historic hotel in old san juan.

Other people rated the El Convento #1, so although it was a little pricier than most, I decided this was the perfect place to stay. We booked their \"Romance\" package that came with Champagne and Truffles. The hotel touts itself as a 350 year old former convent converted into a \"luxury\" hotel. Even with an upgraded \"Vista\" suite, the hotel itself was nice, but FAR from from luxurious. Just to give you a frame of reference, we're not wealthy people with unrealistic expectations. Rather, we're a middle class couple that doesn't typically pay $250-plus per night in hotels. Nonetheless, I wanted to treat my wife and thought this was the place to go. Our upgraded \"Vista\" suite was probably the smallest hotel room we have ever had. Large enough for one queen bed, dresser, chair, and little else. The \"Veranda with a beautiful view of San Juan Harbor\" was merely a full height window (approx. 4 feet by 6 feet...only half of which opened) with a railing that almost touched the outside of the glass inches away. There is nothing to step out onto, you must remain fully in the room. I had always thought of a veranda as a small balcony that extended at least a little outwards from the exterior of a building. This would better be described as a window that opens inward, with a railing in front of it. As far as the view...it was there but you had to look over many buildings and obstacles to see the water. I could have overlooked the size of the room and view, but so much else was disappointing such as: - Air conditioning not working properly - Internet Connection not working at all - Large plastic door sign (with fire evacuation directions and daily rates) falling off in the middle of the night scaring us to death that someone was breaking into our room. Our experience was so far from what we expected. After the first night I requested that they let us out of our three-day pre-paid commitment to actually find the luxury that they had promised, but not delivered upon. This led us to experience what really was special about El Convento. They not only apologized and let us out of our commitment, they provided a full refund for the night we were there without our even asking for it. The staff was so nice there, that I actually feel a bit guilty writing a negative review about the place. I am only doing so to let others know what to expect. Don't get me wrong, the hotel is nice...just a far cry from a luxury property in our opinion. We ended up going to the Marriott Stellaris Resort on Condado beach. For a little less money (with AAA discount), we now had a huge room with TWO large balconies, an amazing full view of the Ocean, air conditioning that worked, and an overall amazing experience. I really have to give El Convento their due for an exceedingly high degree of commitment to customer service, even when we no longer wanted to be their customer. They allowed us to salvage our luxury vacation plans and for that, I am thankful. Just know that your room is more likely to be on the scale of a Howard Johnson's than anything truly luxurious. I really can't explain how there were so many glowing reviews of this property...but there are.

The hotel is pricey, so that was a negative, but otherwise the hotel delivered on absolutely everything it said it would. I believe most people go for the appearance and history of the hotel, plus its location in Old San Juan. We got everything that we were looking for there. My only negative is price of food at the hotel. We went to the courtyard breakfast and the italian restaurant (Il perugio), both extremely overpriced. We finally found La Bombanera 4 blocks away (recommended by Rachel Ray), just down the street from Walgreens. It is a very affordable place to eat breakfast. We ate there twice for less than $10. They serve everything from pancakes to bacon to pastries. It is well worth the 4 block walk. Also, the hotel will let you go to the beach at a sister hotel (there are 2). We chose to go to La Concha...amazing. The beach and ocean were beautiful, and the service on the beach was the best I have ever seen. Employess placed the chairs on the beach where we wanted them, then dug a hole and placed an umbrella to cover both chairs where we wanted it. They also got towels for us and would take drink orders. The best service ever on the beach. Well worth the $30 round trip taxi ride. It was the best day we had on the trip. They also have about 3 infinity pools there, with beds everywhere for you to lay out on. One great aspect of Hotel El Convento were the employees that they always had posted at the door...they could tell you where anything was and the best way to get there. Old San Juan is amazing...extremely safe, with police on most corners. You could be out any time of the night and still feel safe. The wall surrounding San Juan is just a block down the street...a great place for pictures. The fort is a heftier walk...do not do this in the extreme heat...but otherwise an enjoyable tour. Afterwards you can jump on the open air trolley that will take you around the outside of Old San Juan so you can see what else is near. Old San Juan is an extremely quaint town...lots of history and many souvenier shops to check out. And everyone speaks English there. Back to the hotel...would highly recommend it, but do not go to the hotel restaurants if you want affordable food. The pizzeria located on the second floor (accessable from outside) was very good and affordable though.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "jersey city, nj", "Title": "\u201cHistoric, romantic and in the heart of the old city\u201d", "Author": "jdjc", "ReviewID": "UR62707895", "Content": "We stayed at El Convento as part of our honeymoon, and it was excellent.

There is a wine and cheese reception every evening and after our trip it was nice to sit on the patio and relax. We could sit on the patio with other guests or sit on one of the walkways at a private table. There was also an honor bar that was open for the entire trip so we had cocktails after dinner that we took to the pool. There are free bottle of water in the library so we stopped and got water before walking to the fort on our second day, which was very convenient. The tapas restaurant that is located on the second floor was very good and was a pretty good value too. We got a pitcher of sangria and a couple of different plates for less than $80. We ate at the restaurant in the courtyard for breakfast the second day (not sure what the name was). It was very good and very relaxing.

But if you're looking for brand new, state-of-the-art, sleek, modern, and spacious, find somewhere else. All the charm in El Convento comes from the fact that it used to be a convent -- so it's designed to be peaceful, quiet, and private. We arrived early, but the bellhop was very friendly and stored our luggage for us until the room was ready. We had a small room way off in a corner, but it was still well-appointed (comfy bed and pillows, clean bathroom with toiletries). It was nice to be in a luxury hotel that didn't charge extra for internet! We missed the managers reception with complimentary wine and cheese but others told us that it was fun. All the rooms are around the outside of the building, with a courtyard in the middle, where there are two restaurants and lots of places to sit. On the inside of the walkways are tables and chairs so you can sit outside your room and look into the courtyard, much nicer than looking out at the building next door or the crowded streets of San Juan. As you'd expect of a former convent, there is a beautiful church next door, but alas, they had only Spanish services (although we were tempted to go anyway). The only slow service I saw was when the printer at the two-station computer center was out of paper, but the front desk eventually gave me paper and I appreciated being able to print our boarding passes at the hotel. We ate dinner at the restaurant on the second floor, pricey but delicious and very romantic, and we ate breakfast at the restaurant on the first floor, which was also pricey (what you'd expect for an upscale hotel) and yummy. There is a small plunge pool on the sun deck, as well as (I believe) a jacuzzi - when is it ever cool enough to need one? - and deck chairs. Beach towels provided. Apparently for the price of a cab ride (about $15) you can go to a sister hotel and use the beach club there; the beaches are public but this would give you facilities as well.

Carnival contracts out labor through the Wedding Experience and they provide you with an \"experienced wedding coordinator.\" She was no where close to experienced, she picked us up a few days prior to our wedding to get the last details squared away with our marriage certificate. She arrived over an hour late! Then once she finally arrived her car was filthy! She informed us that she was going to be our transportation from Carnival to Hotel El Convento on our wedding day. She arrived to pick myself and my father up at the pier 10-15minuets late; since she was late there I arrived to my wedding late! She proceeded to rush the photographer while he was taking pictures before the ceremony had begun. The photographer that the Wedding Experience hired was terrible; he tried to make me kiss my dad! We had a major language barrier and then he proceeded to try and charge us $350.00 more because he was only hired for an hour, (I had already paid Carnival in full). The minister arrived over 20 minuets late and was rushed by the coordinator to hurry up with the ceremony. The ceremony begins and I suddenly realize the vows that I had emailed to Rosie from the Wedding experience a week earlier were nowhere in the ceremony! Now, I am back from my honeymoon, Carnival and The Wedding Experienced have yet to apologize. I received my marriage certificate in the mail and there is incorrect information on it, after I paid the Wedding Experience $285.00 for the certificate!

This hotel has made all the difference in my trip to Puerto Rico. I am staying at three different hotels on my trip and this is by far the best so far. The location is ideal. In a very safe part of OLD San Juan, right on a piazza. The hotel is beautiful while retaining much of its original historic charm. The staff is fabulous. Not only were they a breeze to work with while booking my room, they gave wonderful recommendations of where to go while in town. These recommendations included a trip to the island of Vieques which requires you stay overnight. The woman i spoke with, Christine, even gave me the name of a good place to stay on the island. Though this other hotel had no affiliation with Hotel Convento. Upon check-in, I received the same exceptional service. The bellman, and receptionist were kind beyond words. They made you feel like you had just made a new friend. The hotel has a roof top pool with breathe-taking views of the bay and the city. At 6 o'clock every night they have a complimentary wine reception. Though i have been to other hotel who hold similar cocktail hours, El Convento's was really fantastic. 6 different wines to choose from and 6 or 7 fresh gourmet cheeses, cracker and fruit to nibble on with the wine. They restocked all of this the whole hour. It was fabulous. In the room, their are great stereos, nice flat screen tvs, complimentary water bottles, and robes (they looked very comfy but i didn't actually use one). I slept wonderfully in the bed, the bathrooms were of a good size, and they offer Aveda products in the bathroom (no cost of course). The turn down service was so nice.

The hotel is excellent. The front desk staff were great, the room was fabulous with every little thing done right: goose down (not feather) pillows, Turkish towels and bathrobes, turn down service, Aveda shower/shampoo/soap, chocolates on pillows in evening, etc. The wine and cheese reception is fantastic - four different reds, four different whites, plus a very good selection of cheeses (bries, manchego, soft goat, bleu, port salut, etc.). The common areas are meticulously cared for. We used both the sister beaches (La Concha and Courtyard); I would skip the Courtyard - a $20 cab ride gets you to a musty Marriott with a pretty good beach right behind the airport. La Concha is much better - the facility itself is stylish and well cared for with a leisurely but chic atmosphere and although the beach is smaller, we liked it better. The only thing we really could complain about (and it did matter to us) is that El Convento's food is a disappointment. The Tapas place is expensive and the food is sad: sliced olives from a jar, 'chorizo' sausages that were cold and crappy. The Nispero patio for breakfast was also disappointing. Our eggs were room temperature at best (both orders), and we each got about 5 little potato home fries. The service is very good and it's clear that they're trying hard, but the quality in the food department needs help at El Convento. I don't write this to complain too much - our stay at El Convento was absolutely fantastic and we really, really loved it. I would recommend this hotel very highly and I would stay there again. It really was fantastic in virtually every respect. I just wouldn't recommend the food there. Instead, try St. Germain at 156 Calle del Sol - just a 5 min walk from El Convento.

However, we took advantage of a day trip to the sister property, La Concha, which provided us with the resort feel for several hours. Staff at El Convento provided us with a letter to transfer any costs incurred at La Concha to our bill at El Convento. That was a nice plus. However, we all agreed we preferred El Convento over La Concha because of the smaller more intimate setting. The rooms at El Convento were comfortable; we enjoyed the bathrobes and slippers, yet the bathrooms were small. My husband was pleased with the second sound proof door, which was very effective in keeping the din from the courtyard out of our room.

I was thrilled to find this hotel. The location is perfect in Old San Juan though not in walking distance to the port if you have a lot of luggage - just a short taxi ride away. I knew immediately that we would love this hotel as we were greeted by Ivan (with a sincere smile!) to help us with our luggage and to the front desk. The front desk staff is first rate. Though our room was not ready (we arrived early) they immediately stored our luggage as well as took our cell number to call us when our room was prepared so that we could go out and about the town. (Room 322) The room was 2 full size (?) beds but so comfortable with premium bedding and the best pillows ever! Flat screen HD television with satelite/movies etc. Bath amenities by AVEDA. Though small bathroom the tub/shower is nice and decor was perfect. Nice desk area with stationary and even post cards. Complementary bottled water and a refrigerator in the room Bath robes to use/slippers. We did not have any view..except an alley way where a coca cola truck was parked for deliveries in the morning. It did not matter to us as we were exhausted and it was a beautiful view out the front door! :) We were so tired and did not use it but a housekeeper knocked and asked if we would like turndown service, chocolates or ice in the evening. Very nice! The hotel itself is gorgeous with greenery everywhere. I'm not sure if the tree frogs are \"real\" or not but the chirping sounds in the trees was awesome. Beautiful restaurant areas and an Honor System room/bar/snacks on the 3rd level attached to a scenic outdoor patio area perfect to sip tea or coffee in the morning or have an afternoon cocktail. So many flowers and greenery..someone does an amazing job of keeping this hotel looking immaculate! There is a small pool area on the level above ..I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all the amenities. Also, at sister hotel La Concha (friends stayed there pre cruise - directly on beach with also gorgeous amenities!) There is a small but nice fitness area with proper equiptment downstairs. There were only two things that distracted from the beauty of this hotel. (Reminder.. these were just things that I would want to know about ahead of time or when considering a hotel..we booked this hotel through a discount booking agent but if I had to pay regular rates this would have definitely have been more of a factor...) There was a wedding/reception which went late into the night on the Sunday we stayed. It was VERY loud in the courtyard area. I appreciate the fact though that I think someone from the hotel might have quieted it down because it was completely quiet from about 1am to 5am. Front desk gave us a coupon for a free sangria but when we asked in the restaurant it is when you buy an entree. No worries we would just buy the cocktail with an app and then go out for a walk around town before leaving. 2. The waitress was not very pleasant and took a long time with drinks and food. We didn't see her again until time for the bill and then that took a long time too. Luckily, there was a terrific manager (female) who came right over and assisted us. I am just mentioning it because it was so \"off\" for such a nice hotel.

It feels like an upscale Marriot - a hundred or so tiny rooms fashioned by a corporate 'design team' with a text book understanding of Puerto Rican culture. There is something very inauthentic here - like Ethan Allen launching a new Spanish-Religious collection. Maybe we were delusional in thinking we would seed old nuns roaming the halls working the rosary instead of sun-burnt adolescents from Cleveland flanking the lobby with bags of Doritos. And while I suppose ambience isn't everybody's issue - there are plenty of other things to note about the hotel - both good and bad. The outstanding attribute is the staff. Everyone working here wants to help - everyone we spoke to was caring, friendly and smart. They are invested in your good time. This we loved. Everyone there deserves a raise. If you want good service and and to really feel looked after - this is the place to go. They are on it!! The food. The service that comes with the food is super. The food itself - not so much. It's good - but not inventive. El Convento is voted the best hotel in all of PR - and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive. The food should blow you away. It just doesn't. Ceasar salad anyone? And then there is this wine and cheese event everyone is talking about. Newsflash - you won't be meeting you fiance(e) at this gathering. We're not being cynical, really. We went by and checked it out three times (who is going to knock a free glass of wine?) It's not the colorful social scene everyone is making it out to be - there were five or ten obese tourists sitting in solitary groups, not talking. And strong cheese in that kind of heat is never inspired. Not sure what else to say - at the right time of year when the rates are more in the $200-$300 range \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this would be a good hotel to check out. I guess when you are shelling out $500 during the winter holidays for a night in Old San Juan - you will have some expectations. As far as hanging at the hotel: The major problem is the pool - there really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one. There is a plunge pool on the 4th floor roof deck. If there's three people in the pool, you've just had a three way. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that small. There some lounge chairs there - about 10 of them - and truly, there is nothing atmospheric that might warrant a lazy afternoon there. On the plus, the view is interesting and you can make yourself a drink from the honor bar. Seemed like a good place to make friends. Drunk hotel guests found their way up there on the nights we were there and were passed out on the floor for the evening. Second: The ocean view they talk about - yeah it's there but its available from about 20% of the rooms ( ours had a view of it - but then it cost us $500 a night) - and it's not breathtaking on any account. You over look a lot of dilapidated buildings and rooftops - and so on a clear day, it's nice, but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring home the Caribbean experience you hope for when you are surfing the net, planning your holiday. The biggest let down of all (which was a surprise when so many reviewers had heralded it) was the location. Huh? Not sure what everyone is going on about - the hotel is unimpressively situated in the middle of a cramped shopping district - loud, not that clean, and not so interesting - are any of us looking to spend time in Coach or Walgreens during an island getaway? We do need to give a plug for San Juan in general. We loved it !! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great city, very festive and diverse and cool to hang in - but Condado is where it's happening - and that is $20 dollar cab ride from El Convento, and 20 minutes away. We live NYC - we know traffic. We have never seen traffic like this - to get a cab and go anywhere out of old San Juan - you can expect to sit and a gridlock for quite some time. Maybe this is during the holiday season only \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that was our experience. So do yourself a favor - if you are a stickler for details or simply have a pulse, stay at their sister property - La Concha. And then visit Old San Juan for the day dine at Dragon Fly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or have lunch at El Convento. Chk out the forts etc.. But don't stay there unless you are attending a conference near by or something. Not fun. Not scenic. Not cool.

I think in general the housekeepers don't read the sign and they assumed that if there's a sign, it meant \"Privacy Please\". Perhaps the hotel should either reinforce the housekeepers to read better or simply not have double-sided signs to be hung on the doors. Our room was not cleaned until later in the evening during their \"Turndown round\" or evening room setup. I guess it wasn't a big deal since we were out most of the day.

If you want a glass and steel hotel dont stay here. If you want a unique hotel with excellent service situated in a wonderful position overlooking a small square and the cathedral in the old part of San Juan this is for you.

The tapas bar served wonderful food, the breakfast was delicious. The only disappointment was a meal we had in the restaurant across the road which is featured on the hotel's website, Il Perugino. We had a very poor meal there, very expensive and certainly not of the standard I would have expected. The rooms are furnished in dark Spanish furniture, the beds very comfortable.

We were assigned room 315, on the hotel's third story, and found the bed comfortable, the bathroom small but adequate (good Aveda amenities, too!), and the little seating area with a table and two chairs a nice place to have coffee in the morning. We enjoyed the free hot coffee, tea, and bottled water, liked the manager's reception, and had a nice lunch at El Picoteco (the hotel's tapas restaurant) on a day when rain poured so hard that leaving the hotel really wasn't an option (street drainage in a city that old is, not surprisingly, a little lacking). But all these good memories, unfortunately, are overshadowed by the fact that someone from the hotel's staff came into our room, in our absence, and stole my partner's cell phone from where it sat on the desk just inside the secondary door to the room (each room has a little hallway which leads to the bedroom), along with a small amount of money also sitting on the desk. How do I know it was a hotel person? Well, there were two keys to the room, and they were with us at all times, and secondly, this theft occurred the same night that I had answered the door to refuse turndown service before we headed out to dinner. When we left, the people doing the turndown service were a few doors down and clearly watched us leave (as in, I saw them looking at us as we walked away). We came back around 10 and went to sleep, and thus did not realize the theft had occurred until the next morning (when we noticed the phone charger was still plugged into the wall but, um, not connected to a phone, and that the couple of dollars we'd set aside for the maids was also missing). After tearing the room apart to make sure that the phone hadn't fallen behind something, or gotten tossed in a bag of ours, we contacted the front desk immediately, and the man working said he'd look into it with housekeeping, but when we got in touch with him three hours later he told us he was still checking on the situation. What was there to check out? Someone ON THE STAFF CAME INTO OUR ROOM AND STOLE OUR PHONE. In my opinion, the issue should've ended there with them filing an incident report and compensating us for our stay (you think it's excessive to ask the hotel to cover a two-night stay because one of its own employees is a thief?) And unfortunately, tracking down the thief was made impossible by the fact that a) the hotel has NO video surveillance in its corridors (and yes, I understand that the hotel is extremely old, but I think that's taking an unnecessary risk--what if someone fell in a hallway, or was assaulted by someone? It'd be his/her word against the hotel's!) and b) uses actual keys for their rooms, rather than the digital cardkeys more modern places use (which leave digital records when they're used so that entry/exits from rooms can be tracked if necessary). The front desk guy said he would fill out an incident report, and asked us if we wanted to file a police report too. I said that since it was a theft, we might as well, and he explicitly said that he would take care of both. So we left with no resolution, just a promise on their end to look into the situation (which included calling the place where we'd had dinner the night before to make sure we hadn't left it there--in case we were mistaken, I guess). We went on to our next hotel (we stayed at a total of four hotels on this trip, and this--the most upscale of them all!--is the only one where we had a problem), and heard nothing from them for two days. Then, on the fourth day, WE called THEM and were given a little bit of a runaround on the phone (the manager was not at the desk, but would return in an hour or so and give us a call back; three hours later we called back (incurring charges for all these calls, of course!) and reached one of the receptionists/front desk people--a sweet and helpful girl, but utterly powerless to do anything--who said that the manager had left for the night but that someone would call us tomorrow about it), so on the fifth day of our vacation, we spoke to Soledad, reexplaining the situation AGAIN, and she told us that all she could do was to get in touch with the hotel's insurance company and send us paperwork to fill out so we might be reimbursed for the value of the phone. She also told us that we'd been misinformed by the first man we spoke to at the hotel, and that it was impossible for them file a police report on our behalf--we'd have to be present to do so. We felt that this was completely unacceptable--the insurance paperwork would take several weeks at least to be processed, she said, and we'd been dealing with this situation for most of our brief vacation and wanted a resolution. Soledad called us back the next day and offered to compensate us for one night's stay at the hotel (as well as for a $99 phone usage charge we'd incurred while calling a COLLECT number at El Convento, believe it or not). We were exhausted at this point and accepted the offer so that we could finally stop thinking about it and enjoy the last day of our vacation.

Though it was way more than I would usually pay ($US245/night), it was worth it for location and quiet. After reading about cheaper hotels in Old San Juan being noisy, I figured the price would keep out the young partiers, though of course that is not always the case. As it was Hallowe'en the night before I left on my cruise, I was afraid I wouldn't sleep, but the hotel is so solidly built I heard nothing at all. There are also soundproofing doors out to the alley and to the middle courtyard. Not so lucky were the people who stayed at The Hilton Caribe that night - I was told they had a 10,000 person party and no one was able to sleep or even approach the hotel in a taxi. The El Convento hotel itself is charming, ancient yellows and dark woods, soft beds, deluxe bath products, and great service. I threw my neck out dancing salsa one night and wished I had my chiropractor from home. Soledad from the front desk fixed me up with Jesus, a registered massage therapist, who did a great job and got my mobility back. Hiram on the front desk attended to my every need including luggage storage. The hotel has a reception with snacks nightly which is very nice and unlimited free bottled water and internet!!! Its location is unbeatable, across from a historic church and right in the middle of everything, a few blocks from all the restaurants, bars, Starbucks, pretty plazas, the fort, etc, anything you want to see or do. Anyone on a cruise must come a few days early to explore San Juan. There are two free trolleys with lots of hop-on hop-off stops, you can ride them all day and they will take you anywhere but the Panamerican pier, which unfortunately requires a $17 taxi for those departing on Royal Caribbean. From the hotel, I walked to the Spirits of Puerto Rico dinner at Baru, put on by Legends of Puerto Rico. Not cheap ($90) but the food was yummy and plentiful and we got a full lesson on rums and tasted 12 different ones. Leader Debbie Morales is great and joining others certainly was more fun than doing it on my own! Had fresh squeezed juice and cinnamon roll at the institution known as La Bombonera, a friendly breakfast place in OSJ. Food at Parrot Club was ok, good if you like Latin jazz and bottomless fresh juice again. El Convento also has an agreement with the beach club at La Concha in Condado, so I went to try it out, and was able to bill lunch to my account at El Convento. I could have taken the bus but as time was a priority, just swallowed the $15 taxi fare to Condado. La Concha was very nice, modern, sort of charmless but great service and gym. A well-guarded beach provided lounges and the infinity pool overlooking the beach was so pretty! I preferred walking around OSJ over Condado. El Convento has a small plunge pool on the roof, which you need when it is hot!! The only reason I would not give the room 5* is there was a lack of good water pressure, but other than that it was a real pleasure at this hotel.

However, I felt there were too many small inconveniences to make it a memorable trip: > Room: I was allocated 214 which is on the 2nd floor for the US (1st floor UK) and too low to receive much natural light; I would recommend asking for the 3rd floor and above. > A/C: it's quite noisy and not intuitive to operate so that it came on at 2.00am during my first night, waking me up; I couldn't switch it off and had to call a guy from reception to help. > Mosquitos: the rooms open onto a gallery which looks out onto an inner courtyard which allows mosquitos in when they're being cleaned or serviced; I found an insect spray in the room but only after being bitten several times during the first night. > Bulb missing in the bathroom which was not replaced despite my asking. > No room service except breakfast which, as a \"solo traveller\" I missed (I like the option of having dinner in the room watching TV). > There was only one restaurant open at the hotel for dinner - a tapas bar - which gets a good write-up in the guides but which I didn't much like (there is a caf\u00c3\u00a9 but I was told it was closed for the low season); they also have a live flamenco show which you can hear from inside the rooms. > Late checkout: I was asked to request this on the morning of departure which I did and it was agreed (for 1.00pm) but I was later called at 12.30 asking when I was leaving. > Airport transfer: I had to remind the lady at reception twice that this was included in the rate. > Water: there was none on Sunday evening (problem at the hotel) and none on Monday (problem with the supply in that part of the city) - not the easiest place to be without it! Despite this whingeing, I will return because I now know the \"dos and the don'ts\" and because of: > The service which is generally of a high standard and extremely friendly. > In-room amenities: free broadband, mineral water and Puerto Rican coffee. > Roof-top terrace with small pool and fantastic view. > Old San Juan embodying all that is fascinating for me about the Caribbean: the historical Spanish/Catholic influence, meticulously preserved city centre with spectacular views of the Atlantic coast, very friendly people, great restaurants and bars.

Two days I was up there an older fellow with his oils, canvasses and brushes was painting all afternoon off to himself. They had Dasani water bottles iced down all day and evening at no extra charge!

There is no charge for this either. It included 8 wines from around the world, 6-8 cheeses, crackers, grapes, nuts. Very impressive.Right beside this was an honor bar of first class whiskies, scotches, vodka, gin. Mix your own and write up your tab and slip it in the box. I've rarely ever seen this in all of our travels. Along with the above the food in restaurants was also terrific. The bottom floor restaurant for breakfast and lunch had delicious spinach salad and Italian bruschetta. We went back 2 days in a row for those. The evening dining was good as well with name brand drinks for only $6.50 (as opposed to the $11-$12 dollars per drink we paid at our next stop).

We splurged and got a nice room and wanted to really live it up in San Juan before going to Utuado and staying in the forest. We got there right after the check-in time and were checked in at the front desk. When we got to our room, we found that it had two double beds instead of the king we had paid for during our romantic trip... I figured that there must have been an error, so I went back to reception and was told by the manager that they had overbooked for the weekend and could not honor our room request. At the same time, two other couples appeared with the same complaints... They told me that they had upgraded us instead -- which was not apparent from the room, we didn't have a good view or anything. I kept persisting that they either needed to give us a king room or refund part of our stay. The manager finally agreed to move us the NEXT night (we were only there 2 nights...), but refused to compensate us in any way for the difference. She said that since we booked online that we got a special rate so it didn't matter. Overall the staff was pretty rude about it... Aside from that -- the hotel was beautiful. We went to the wine and cheese reception each night, which was really fun before dinner and going out. We also enjoyed the hot tub and the courtyard area. We did not eat at the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. The location couldn't be better - right in the heart of San Juan. The only other comment I have is that I think the hotel is still a bit overpriced. If I did it again I would stay in a guest house or some other hotel. I'm glad we didn't stay at the beach in San Juan though because other couples told us that it was so so and more resortish. We also went to Vieques later which was amazing for beach trips. I also don't think I would go back to San Juan. It's a cool city but a little too touristy and expensive. Other parts of Puerto Rico were so much more amazing - i.e. Utuado and Vieques. I don't really want to go to Puerto Rico to shop (which is what San Juan is all about), and the food was awesome but expensive too.

If driving to the hotel, get there, park in the lot provided and walk or take a cab everywhere. Old San Juan is a tough place to drive, especially if in a car larger than an economy-size rental. However, if you choose to go to the Mariott Isla Verde resort, negotiate a price with the cab driver before leaving. Our round trip drive to the beach cost us $60US because the outbound trip was $40 (un-negotiated) and inbound negotiated price was only $17. At only $20 for valet parking at the Mariott, it would have been much cheaper to just drive. Its not a hard drive after escaping the tiny streets of OSJ. Isla Verde was an OK beach, but not as nice as in some of the outlying areas. The Mariott was a typical 3-star resort, with the high prices that go along with a beach resort. It is nice to be able to visit another location and charge everything back to the room. Our room was clean, neat and well appointed. The old tile floor was lovely and had been lacquered to help seal it and keep it clean. The bathrooms are small, but this is a 400 year-old building. Despite the small size, the bathroom was clean and modern. Drinks and food were much more reasonable than at the large resorts and in our opinion, of a higher quality. The food at the tapas bar was excellent. The nightly wine and cheese reception was a perfect way to start each evening. Get there early for best cheese selection! Its not a problem, but something to be aware of\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the hotel has many bats flying in the upper central courtyard and on the deck by the wine/cheese area. The 4th floor is open and the bats freely fly around for a few hours at dusk, occasionally flying near the rooms. The 3rd floor room area has awnings and we did not see a bat on our floor. In fact, we went up and sat in a chair on the 4th floor to watch them fly around. I had never seen them flying at eye level, so it was a real treat. Remember, healthy bats are harmless and eat a lot of bugs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is necessary in a tropical area.

In the 1950's millionaire Robert Woolworth of the Woolworth 5&10 fortune (I remember chocolate sodas at the restaurant bar in Woolworth's in the 50's-so now you know my age) resurrected the convent into a luxury hotel visited by Ernest Hemingway and Rita Hayworth etc. It then fell into less prosperous times but fortunately in the late 90's was renovated to the tune of $275,000 per room. Even though the building has a remarkable history the attentive, caring, incredibly competent staff and service lights up your life. As we departed, the gentleman who saw us off said \"God bless you' and appropriate send off from a convent. Another highlight was the nightly manager's reception from 6-7 pm with wonderful red and white wines , a remarkable selection of cheeses, strawberries and grapes enjoyed by hotel guests at no charge! We met so many wonderful people and had great conversations with folks from everywhere of all ages. They also offered free bottled water and coffee at all times in this beautiful 3rd floor area overlooking San Juan Harbor.One evening a massive down pour created the most dramatic rainstorm we ev er experienced in the courtyard. Bose sound systems are in all rooms with a university of PR station playing world music and classical music. Flat panel TV's provided us Steeler fans with a Pittsburgh 20 Arizona 10 win to complete a perfect vacation! Il Perugino was a great Italian restaurant across the street and we loved The Parrot Club, Trois Cent Onze and Marmalade on Calle Fortaleza. The Governor's Palace (La Fortaleza had tours on Mon and Fri) and forts El Morro and San Cristobal have amazing tour guides (run by the National Park Service. If you are 62 or over you can get a lifetime pass to all National Parks for $10-guess they don't think we'll be around long. If you're looking for a cookie cutter Hyatt, Hilton on the beach-this is not the place for you. If you want to step back in history, visit a rainforest, meet some of the friendliest people on earth- El Convento is heaven on earth.

Our first impression of the friendly and expert service offered by the hotel was from George, the doorman/porter who was always eager to help. This was followed by more of the same at reception. The staff proved to be reliable resources for dining and any other information requested. We had a deluxe room located next to only two others on a small private hallway just off the courtyard and a great view of the plaza. Even with events going on, such as the wedding during our visit, we heard no noise from either inside or outside the hotel. And the very cold air conditioner kept us comfortable considering the oppressive July temperatures. Making good use of the third floor roof terrace every morning for coffee and each evening for the wine and cheese reception proved to be a great benefit.

There is a small pool on the roof of the hotel which was just fine. It was quite and had very few visitors. We did decide to take an excursion to El Convento's sister hotel which is La Concha. A huge beach front resort with 3 pools. The hotel was very swanky and had a great pool area but we were so glad we didn't stay there b/c the area surrounding it had no character.

My spouse and I are both fresh air people and the prevailing breeze required that if we were sitting on the courtyard balcony and wanted to get air into our room we would have to prop our door open.

El Convento boasts a \"manager's happy hour\" every night with wine, cheese, and fruit that provides a pleasant way to pass the early evening either with your traveling companion(s) or socializing with other guests. Staff are so attentive to the services that they provide that one night when we refused the turn down service not only did we get a call from the front desk to make sure that indeed we had refused we got a written note asking that if we found the service lacking that we please let them know what they could do to improve. We found this seriousness highly amusing and incredibly charming. The location of El Convento, too, was a selling point when we booked and came in quite handy as the hotel is just a short walk from two of the main plazas in the city and from a lot of good restaurants and shopping. El Convento also maintains a \"sister\" relationship with a couple of other hotels allowing guests access to the beach and the ocean.

So first, lets start with service...because that is what completely blew us away. When I had booked the room online a few months ago, I had briefly mentioned that we would be honeymooners. As many other hotels forget little things like that, I expected the same but WOW was I surprised when we checked-in an 11 pm and in our room waiting on our bed was a huge heart made of purple and yellow fresh rose petals and well as accompanying plush robes and slipper sets. It was the perfect start to a trip we'll never forget. The hotel is centrally located around so many wonderful things within walking distance: a cathedral built in 1511 that is the second oldest on the entire island is right across the street..the famous restaurant \"La Bombonera\" is only 3 blocks down and other restaurants serving authentic cuisine such as \"Raices\" and \"Cafe Puerto Rico\" are also only a few blocks away. Both Castillos (San Felipe and El Morro) are also both walkable and well worth the 3 bucks they charge to get in. The pictures from both are breathtaking. The only drawback (you would think) is that the hotel is not on the beach..but not to worry! El Convento has a deal with their sister hotel La Concha on Condado Beach where you just say \"hey I'd like to go the the beach\" and they type you up a cool little letter that gives you a FREE beach and pool pass to the resort for your entire stay. There is a $15 cab ride involved, but it's only about a 10-15 ride depending on traffic since the streets are pretty small.. Definitely worth it..all those wallpapers of carribean beaches with palm trees?? That's EXACTLY what it looks like! Needless to say, we wore ourselves out during our week long stay..thats why on nights likeThursday night when we were so tired..but I HAD to have some sangria..it was worth the $ to stay here especially when I called the front desk and said \"guys..I'd love some sangria..but we're too tired to go out..\" and then within 15 minutes the bartender was at our door with a pitcher and 2 glasses. Honestly, if you're looking for the cookie-cut resort kinda thing..stick to Condado Beach. But if you really appreciate history, beauty, and the \"good like\" in general...El Convento is definitely the place for you. No questions asked. Special thank-yous to: Hiram, Shannon, and Uncle Bob.

Even the bellhop was surprised at our good fortune and said that early check-in's are unusual. We spent the day walking around town and doing a Segway tour and then going back to the hotel for the mixer at 6 pm. While there we met another couple and decided to have dinner together.

While researching a second trip for 2009, I found the review I'd written and never posted about the hotel: We enjoyed a wonderful Thanksgiving week at El Convento hotel in Old San Juan. It was truly the perfect place to stay. We booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fall Vacation Deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through the hotels website and got a wonderful deal under $200 per night for our Monday-Friday trip. Our room was on the second floor and looked out onto a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd alley decorated with beautiful flowers. Out the front door of the room we faced the hotel's gorgeous courtyard. Even though there were loud private parties in the courtyard two of the nights we were there, the sound did not filter into our room. Other rooms on the higher floors look over rooftops to the San Juan Bay, but our view was just right. We were greeted on arrival by Soledad, who immediately put us at home with her warm personality and activity suggestions. She arranged a rainforest tour for us with Native Tours (a private tour with just us and one other couple from the hotel) and did not steer us wrong. It amazed me how everyone in the hotel switched so easily from English to Spanish. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak Spanish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wish I did, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it. The hotel offers many amenities, as described by other reviewers: the roof-top patio with teeny pool and hot tub offers a wonderful place to relax in the afternoon. The third-floor meeting room, library and public area hosts free coffee and water all day, an honor bar for alcohol, and a can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss wine-and-cheese buffet every night. The little library has one free computer, and all rooms have wireless access. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fitness center as well, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we did plenty of walking in Old San Juan. The room was old with gorgeous high beamed ceilings and antique furniture. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom was just right. We had trouble with lighting one but that was quickly resolved. El Convento is truly close to everything \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the cruise ship-focused shops, a grocery market and drug store, the two forts (El Morro and Catille San Cristobal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss them) restaurants and beautiful walks (El Morro and La Princesa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss these, either). We recommend El Jibarito for true Puerto Rican comfort food at low prices, and Al Dente for Italian. Ostra Cosa offers great appetizers and tree-frog serenades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where else can you get that? Our cab to the hotel was $22.50 from the airport. Aside from that, we were able to walk everywhere. We did cab one night to dinner at the Ritz Carlton (BLT Steak \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very expensive but highly recommended), also $22.50. At the Ritz Carlton we felt like we could be anywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in any beach hotel in the world. It made us appreciate what we had at El Convento! El Convento is a small boutique hotel.

We initially booked our room at the beautiful La Concha hotel, primarily because it seemed young, cool, modern and intersting. After a few months of thought, and after reading more about El Convento (which has the same owners at La Concha, I believe), we decided that for a relaxing and romantic honeymoon, El Convento would be a better fit. I read many of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and I will confer with the majority of the descriptions. You would be hard pressed to have a bad time in this especially lovely hotel. The service is truly wonderful, with warm and friendly staff, attention to detail and helpful advice. As soon as we walked into the foyer, I knew we had made the right decision. I felt as though we had walked back into time, but still had all of (if not more) the comforts of a technologically advanced home (ie: bose soundsystems, flatscreen televisions, A/C). The decor is charming, the bed was fabulously comfortable, the views are quite memorable, the pool is \"adorable\", and the location is unbeatable. We had excellent recommendations for things to do and places to eat, which I will relay here: Breakfast: La Bombinara--local diner, super-good food, order the ham and cheese mallorca. Dinner: Marmalade--best soup I've ever had, great service, super fun Dinner: Baru--great atmosphere, wonderful raw bar Botello Art Gallery--just something cultural, and you *might* be able to find a poster for under $50. But it's worth it. Most importantly: If you stay at El Convento, you should make every effor to attend the wine and cheese reception.

As an old hotel, I did have some allergy problems - which I attribute to the older building, b/c when we went outside - no problems at all. They do not replace your toiletries everyday - and we had to ask for them - which I was disappointing....For the price you pay at the 5 star, I don't think you should have to ask. They do have great amenities - everyday they have a wine and cheese happy hour for guests from 6-7pm. Nice selection - four whites and four reds - along with about 10 different cheeses and grapes for a snack. Bottled water is free in your room - but like the toiletries, you'll have to ask for more bottles when you run out.. You also have access to a modern resort hotel on the beach - La Concha (which is a part of the Renaissance Hotel chain). The La Concha was very nice and you can go and have everything charged back to your room at the El Convento. Just ask at the El Convento front desk for a letter to get you access to the resort and its beach. They have three restaurants on-site. We tried two - the courtyard restaurant for breakfast - and the tapas restaurant. They will tell you its the best in San Juan...which I wouldn't disagree with since we didn't go to another Tapas place...but I didn't find the food fantastic. I've had better tapas. They do have a nightly Flamenco show - which you can see on the balconies of the interior courtyard while enjoying the nightly wine and cheese happy hour. If you're renting a car, be prepared to pay for your parking. Its a very small lot next to the hotel, but guests always get priority in parking and you can charge it to your room. We paid $25 for our rental car for the whole week, but paid $80 in parking fees. Getting around the area is easy...its mapped out like a grid, and everyone knows where the El Convento is located. Be prepared for traffice on small one way streets. Overall, we really liked the hotel but I think it is a little overpriced for $300+/night. Here's a brief summary: PRO: Happy Hour each night, free upgrade, friendliness of the staff, access to La Concha resort and beach CON: Bit dusty due to the old building; replenishing toiletries/bottled water, and parking", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cMy Happy Place\u201d", "Author": "Here4Now", "ReviewID": "UR25547486", "Content": "One night wasn't enough. We booked here for our last night in Puerto Rico after having been on Vieques Island for four days. This was an excellent way to end the trip, although relaxing on the breezy, third floor terrace just made me crave another day or two like that! We booked the smallest room but were given an upgrade to a suite that had a balcony overlooking the church. We felt very pampered. We showered before the complementary wine/cheese reception and when we returned, staff had already changed our soap and had given us a new bar. Then we left for dinner (excellent choice = Marmalade, at the suggestion of the staff) and had turn-down service when we returned. This is an expensive hotel, but I have to say that if you can swing it - even for a night - stay here. It's historical, the place is very clean, the staff are always available yet hardly ever in sight (unless you need something). There has to be at least two chairs in breezy, quiet out-of-the-way places for every guest! No problem finding a dreamy spot to sit - if you like shade, you can find it. Sun? You can find it. Breeze? Yep. Do you want to meet other guests and chat? There's always someone to chat with. Do you want it quiet and to be on your own? No problem. This was by far the lowest-key and most tranquil place I've been in a long time - and to think that it's in the heart of Old San Juan. We kept our rental car while in Old San Juan and really should have returned it to the airport on our way to Old San Juan and just taken a cab from/to the airport. Street parking is a hassle in Old San Juan unless you get there right when day visitors are leaving and before night visitors arrive. The walk outside the old wall is great. The gate to San Juan (which means, also, the gate OUT to the walkway) is just down the block from El Convento. Lots of cats live in the rocks, but we also saw a big iguana - maybe 3' long from head to tail, right on the rocks. We walked out on the pier at were prompted to look down into the water at the end of the pier. What a beautiful bunch of fish were swimming around and between the rocks! The little tapas bar across the courtyard was excellent - Rosa de Triana. Jose - the owner/partner - was a fabulous bartender/host. If he's there when you go, ask him about flamenco and he might find a photo of himself with some famous flamenco dancers. We feel like he's a friend now. Their mofongo with chicken gravy was expensive but really good. The sangria, also expensive, was very good. Even so, our little lunch turned out to be one of our favorites we've ever had and was a beautiful way to close our trip to Puerto Rico. About dinner at Marmalade in Old San Juan. They sold us on a four or five course meal. The smaller courses were nothing short of excellent and the staff were very willing to explain the food, how it was prepared, how it should be eaten, etc. We were a little disappointed in the main course, but everything else was absolutely scrumptious. To sum it up - we were very pleased with El Convento. Why did I make this caption? Have you ever had a time when you needed to concentrate on a \"happy place\" in order to get through an ordeal? Well, this hotel is my happy place.

We wanted a romantic stay in the heart of Old San Juan. The Hotel itself is a fairly long taxi ride from the hotel - but put us in a part of the city we could walk for the remainder of our visit, which was great. The bellboy greeting our cab was very nice - but immediately assumed we were sisters travelling together. In fact we are couple of 12+ years. It was a little off-putting, but I realize there are cultural roots there. We had a lovely lunch in the courtyard dining room (the food was excellent). The only downside to our check in is that our room was not ready until well after 4 pm, despite the fact we had requested an early check in. Once we got the room, however, it was terrific. Beautiful tile floors, gorgeous woodwork, high beamed ceiling, etc. One note: the full bath had a peeling bathtub finish, which we thought was odd. What was really odd is the next morning we discovered that what we thought was another closet was actually another full, gorgeous bath - complete with marble walk in shower! I believe the room number was 103. I wish the bellboy had shown us that when he took us to the room. I know it sounds dumb that we could have overlooked another full bath, but trust me, we travel a lot and have never seen anything like this! We went to the complimentary wine/cheese reception -- the quality of the cheese was excellent, and we met some nice people there. We did not dine that night at the hotel, but instead chose to walk around Old San Juan (where we did feel safe in the streets with all the other tourists) and had dinner at a small tapas restaurant within sight of the Hotel. I wish I remember the name of it - it was excellent! The Hotel workout room leaves some to be desired. They have weight equipment, but the cardio equipment is very shall we say \"economical home version\" stuff - poor incline, poor impact beds on the treadmills, etc. We ended up taking our workout outside, running up and down the cobbled streets and up and down the old stairs - which was really fun.

The matter was not adequately handled by the manager on duty, but we moved the second night to the room type we had reserved and enjoyed the balance of our stay. After our return, I emailed a complaint to the manager and was impressed with the manner in which he handled the situation and the prompt response to my complaint. We would have been very satisfied if the same level of concern had been exhibited when we discovered the problem after check-in. The problem should have been acknowledged and handled at check-in rather than left for us to discover, complain about, and then not be resolved to our satisfaction. However, El Convento is a beautiful hotel. The restaurants on-site were some of the best meals we enjoyed in Old San Juan. Cana offers a great lunch value and it's lovely to enjoy tapas and wine on the balcony patio outside El Picoteo. Additionally, the wine and cheese reception is well done and we appreciated the complimentary coffee in the morning. We also enjoyed using the beach facilities at a sister hotel and appreciated the tip from the bellman regarding catching the city bus back to Old San Juan.

The mattresses in both rooms were beginning to sag in the middle and were not especially comfortable given the overall quality of the hotel.

Like many hotels I stay in, the shower head was placed at it's highest height, and therefore out of my reach. Additionally, I had requested a shower chair before my stay, and they assured me it would be in the shower when I arrived.

I doubt you could find a hotel with more history or character in all of Old San Juan. Not to mention an ideal location. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and ammenities were very nice. As others have noted the plunge pool is small and lounge chairs are limited but it was kept very nicely, has great views and was overall just very enjoyable. The highlight of the stay was the afternoon wine reception. A really nice selection of cheese and wine were served on the terrace with brilliant views of the illuminated cathedral. While we did not have the chance to eat or drink at the hotel restaurants, the tapas bar looked real cool. There was however one slight problem - the air conditioner. In the middle of the night (2AM) my girlfriend and I both woke up on the verge of a sweat (the AC was on the lowest possible setting but clearly not working). We called the desk and someone came up super quickly. However, it was only the desk clerk who was helpful but not qualified to fix the problem. He offered to call the off-site engineer or move us to another room. In the interest of time, we took the other room down the hall but he sort of insisted we take all of our belongings with us. Which, as you can imagine, wasn't too fun at that hour. I'm not sure why we couldn't leave them there until morning. These things do I happen and I understand. However, I was surprised that there was no apology or modest compensation the following morning (like sending morning coffee/breakfast up to the room or a small credit). Aside from the air conditioner it was a great stay and I would highly recommend it. It was convenient to all the historic sites, shopping and dining. After a long day of walking the sites, it was great to have our room so close. After a nap by the pool, a shower, and glass of wine...we were only a few minutes walk from our dinner reservation.

The doorman greets you and sends you on to the concierge. While checking in, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They gave us suggestions of what to do around the area, where to eat, what beach to visit, and a map of the area. El Convento is not on the beach, but it has a sister hotel, La Concha that is. Just take a cab over to the sister hotel and you can use their beach chairs, towels, and pool for free! The room was large and the bathroom looked clean and updated. The room had a flat screen TV, hair dryer, radio, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and mouthwash. On the 3rd floor of the hotel, they offered free bottled water anytime you wanted it. This is great to have when walking around downtown or going over to the beach for the day. The wine and cheese hour was amazing! For one hour, you get to mingle with fellow guests and enjoy red wine, white wine, and a variety of delicious cheeses and grapes. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. It is in Old San Juan within walking distance to El Morro (the fort) and a lot of shopping, restaurants, and bars. We found all of the people in San Juan to be very friendly and welcoming also. We were very impressed with how fluently everyone we encountered spoke both Spanish and English. We felt very safe walking around during the day as well as at night. I have stayed at another hotel in San Juan and did not enjoy my stay nearly as much as I did this time.

Our server recommended empanadillas filled with lobster to go with the pina coladas we had been craving. They were scrumptious and started us off on a week in which everything we ate was delicious. My only complaint was the $20 resort fee charged on top of the room rates.

The hotel was not fully booked and the only crowds we saw in town were on the days that cruise ships docked for the afternoon. We booked a standard queen room and were given a newly renovated room on the 5th floor (room 515) with a nice bay view. It was fun to open the French doors (no balcony) and see the cruise ships passing by. The room and bathroom were not large but the space was well used and the furnishings were in keeping with the old Spanish feel of the hotel. The bathroom was nicely done with good lighting and marble tiles. The bed was very comfortable with soft sheets and good pillows. Twice daily maid service is provided. The entry to the room is a small hallway with a closet that holds a small refrigerator and a coffee maker. Bottled water is supplied daily as is Alta Grande Puerto Rican coffee. There is a desk in the room with a free internet connection. Nice touches include rustic pottery and a live ivy plant. The heavy wooden doors open to the outside with glass doors behind them that can also be opened. There is a modern glass door between the room and the entry hall that can be closed to keep out the noise and heat from the courtyard. Many of the rooms face the alley along the back of the hotel but it is actually quite nice because this is a pedestrian only alley with pots of tropical flowers in front of the houses. Since the building was originally a convent all the rooms open to broad open-air walkways that face the interior courtyard. Outside each room is a small table and chairs overlooking the courtyard. It was a very nice place to sit with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine listening to the music from the hotel restaurants. At night they come and put candles on all of the hallway table which adds to the ambiance and old world feel. There is currently renovation work going on at the hotel and while we were there the 4th floor was closed. We were told that the renovation started on the 5th (top) floor and is being done floor by floor. I never saw an unrenovated room so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare but our room was bright and fresh so I recommend requesting a renovated room. Since the work is being done inside the rooms there is little construction noise to bother you. We never used the small hotel pool but it has a lovely rooftop location. Unfortunately the hot tub was closed during our stay (which was never mentioned when we booked or checked in). We would have enjoyed that if it had been available. The best amenity at the hotel is the 6 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock wine and cheese reception that is held on a covered patio on the 3rd floor that overlooks the cathedral. A good selection of wines and a very nice spread of cheeses, crackers, and fruit is offered all at no charge from 6-7 p.m. nightly. It was also a nice way to meet other guests. In the same lounge there is also a 24-hour honor bar with wine, beer, liquor and soft drinks and free coffee service. You simply sign a ticket and leave it in the box and it will be billed to your room upon checkout. There are several restaurants inside the hotel on the 1st and 2nd floors of the courtyard. We had breakfast each morning at the Patio Nispero and one night had a wonderful dinner at the El Picoteo tapas bar. The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing in Old San Juan. It is a small town and you can walk everywhere. The streets are hilly and lined with charming houses painted in tropical colors. It is a short walk to El Morro and only a slightly longer walk to San Cristobel. Both forts are worth seeing. Less than two blocks from the hotel (turn right as you exit the front door) is the Old San Juan gate. Once you exit through the gate you can turn left for the Princessa walkway that will take you past the beautiful Raices fountain and down to the cruise ship docks. If you turn right as you pass through the San Juan gate you will be on the 3/4 mile El Morro Trail which is a lovely seaside walkway with the ocean on one side and the towering city walls on the other. Beautiful views from this trail and you will see the famous San Juan cat colony that live in the rocks along the bay. The cats are taken care of (neutered and fed) by the Save A Gato humane society. This is a perfect hotel for Old San Juan if you want to stay in the old town and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about not being near a beach. We had already spent a week at a beach resort so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care to stay at a modern beach hotel in new San Juan; we really wanted the old town experience.

We brought some plastic cups from the previous hotel so we used those. No biggie. The bathtub was not the cleanest thing I have ever used, but it was in the corners of the tub so I just stayed away from those sections. Although I expected it (it is a converted convent after all) the room is really small and smells a bit musty. Again, no biggie.

We had spent the previous 5 days at the Wyndham Rio Mar but we wanted one night in San Juan in order to see the city more fully. We had not originally booked here only b/o the two night minimum on weekends and instead reserved the Marriott in Condado instead, even though honestly, we would have preferred this hotel. Unbeknownst to me, that Marriott was the old Dupont Plaza where the tragic fire of 1986 took place. We had been booked at that hotel for arrival the day of the fire in '86 (when I was but a teenager) and the only reason we were not there was our flight was delayed. To put it mildly, we feel it was a miracle we were not there at the exact time of the fire where 97people lost their lives. Anyway, I found this out only the morning we were supposed to check into the Marriott and I will give them credit, I explained my story and they cancelled our reservation without penalty. I was then scrambling for a hotel and Carlos at El Convento worked a small miracle for us. He found us a double room and waived the 2 night minimum since we were calling for a room for that day. I can't tell you how much his effort and hospitality meant to us. The hotel itself simply could not be more atmospheric and the location was ideal. The nightly wine and cheese reception was a treat with a gorgeous assortment of cheeses and interesting wines, all served on the 4th floor terrace. The 24 hour coffee and tea service and the rooftop pool overlooking the cathedral were also big hits for us. Our room, though without a view, was enormous! All we had to do to get a view was walk 5 paces, so no complaints there. My only word of advice would be for travelers with children. The hotel staff themselves were nothing but gracious and welcoming but I would not say the same for all of the guests - I understand this to a certain point, it is more of an adult hotel but the fact is, they allow children so if other patrons want absolutely no children, they need to find an adult only hotel. We have 2 children ages 5 and 10, who are seasoned travelers and know when they are to be on best manners, and still we got some dirty looks. So while I wouldn't steer families away from the hotel, one night was just right for us. The four of us also had dinner at El Picoteo and thought the food and the atmosphere could not have been beat. I would recommend this hotel for everyone who wants to have total immersion into the charms of Old San Juan, even those with children. I asked my kids to be respectful that the guests were mostly adults who didn't want to hear a lot of screaming kids, and made sure that they were on their best behavior but after that I just didn't let the other guests spoil what is an unforgettable hotel!", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in San Juan\u201d", "Author": "fbusa", "ReviewID": "UR17038606", "Content": "If you like small hotels, in central locations, with bags of character and history, an outdoor dining terrace and bar area overlooking the old town square then you will probably like El Convento.

The hotel has such a great \"feel\" that it was a near-perfect beginning to our vacation. Its location is exceptional to tour Old San Juan and only took 15 minutes from the airport. We parked at valet parking ($20 charged to the room) and proceeded to run around Old San Juan. There were 13 of us so we booked 4 rooms (3 double doubles and one queen). I was a little nervous about paying so much money because I'd seen a couple of reviews where people complained about the room size or quality, but that was certainly not a problem. It was a thrill to stay in a hotel with such history and character. Several members of our group really enjoyed the complimentary 'wine and cheese/fruit' from 6-7pm although not all even attended because some were out touring the sites. No one in our group regularly pays out over $250/night but it was definitely worth it for our one-night stay in San Juan. The one story I will share though is I left my wife in the room to go help others in the group get settled in their rooms and when I returned some 20-30 minutes later my wife was trapped inside the bathroom. I tried in vain to pull the bathroom door open from the outside and finally called the front desk. They had 2 guys up in about 2 minutes and had to take the doorknob off to release her. She thought it was a funny story so it didn't put a damper on our overall experience at the hotel, and no one else in our group was victimized by the El Convento ghosts so I imagine it was a not-so-common experience. We followed their website and then called them directly for rates. I would recommend getting a price by phone (they spoke perfect English) and then also checking Internet rates because I got better rates over the phone although they promise Internet rates are cheaper.

The management was not very helpful when we encountered a problem with our room. Also, housekeeping does a subpar job - i don't think they clean the toilets very frequently. We were in a queen deluxe room for $300 (plus tax), although that was the smallest queen bed i have ever seen and my husband and i couldn't fit in the bathroom together (and we are fairly slender people). The first room we were in, which I was told no less than 75 times was their \"model room\" (i still have no idea why), had this extremely annoying banging noise coming out of the AC duct that happened every 30 seconds or so (with the AC on or off). We complained that night, were told they had no rooms in our rate, so to check back tomorrow. The banging continued all night, so we complained again the next morning and were told they would send an \"engineer\" to look at it and if they couldn't fix it we could switch rooms. When we checked back at 5pm, we were told that the \"engineer\" sat in the room for 30 minutes and never heard it. The manager acted liked we were making it up, which is always a nice attitude. She told us that if we still heard it when we went back, she would switch our room. Of course, within 1 minute of being in the room, we heard it. After making the manager and their engineer come to the room with us, they also heard it within a minute or 2. Then the engineer said \"Yeah, I have heard that before, just not today.\" And you didn't try to fix it last time? Excellent work ethic. They did switch us to another room, which was very quiet. Upon checkout, when we saw that we were billed the full rate for the first night, we complained to the manager on duty (same one as before, lucky us). We didn't want the room for free, but considering the aggravation I felt a little customer coddling was in order. She was clearly annoyed that we were bothering her again and before I even completed my sentence she said she would give us 30% off the rate. That's all I wanted. Well, with a little less attitude. Bottom line - its a very unique building with a gorgeous patio inside (excellent breakfast at their restaurant), and they have a complimentary wine/cheese thing which was lovely, but the management and housekeeping could use some serious work.

This is not normal, it was clear that service was important for the hotel. The Rooms are small but we didn't expect anything big specially in a 300 old small luxury building-hotel and for the price we paid last minute. We met Jaime the door man. Everyone talk's about him. Almost a Celebrity. The location is great next to Coach, Guess, Burberry, Puma and Ralph Lauren Outlets. What I like about Puerto Rico is that you don't have 100 people jumping on top of you trying to sell you something like it happens on other islands, the south of spain or other countries. Early that evening we started walking around the hotel and for our surprise we went to the this little room and the hotel that had Wine and Chesse of the hotel. Great romantic view. We only had bottled water, but they had a full self service bar. I am originally from Spain and we decided to visit the tapas rest for a salad and some drinks. I could only say that only in sevilla you see restaurants so beautiful like this one. Well then we heard music coming from the outside terrace and from my surprise a really nice jazz band was playing. It was another restaurant but we didn't know because there's no signage of the rest inside the hotel and the front desk didn't mention anything. The hotel only has a sign to The Patio Rest and the Picoteo Rest. The two tables seating next to us at the terrace were enjoying a 5 Rum Flight with a Rum Expert. They really seemed to be having a good time. The hotel should hand out or provide a small information recommendation guide mentioning all the rest they have and its concept. Because they are all unique and different and they all have there charm and theme. Well it was a Rum Bar called Kane or Ca\u00c3\u00b1a. Really good mojito. We enjoy the rest of the night enjoy from the jazz band the hotel provided in the outside terrace next to a incredible art statue. My couple wanted to stay viewing some sports game inside the restaurant but not on our only night in Puerto Rico.

We chose El Convento based on Tripadvisor's review and the location in Old San Juan. Booked the hotel online for $220/night (twin superior). With taxes and fees, the charge was shy of $300.00. So this is not a cheap hotel. Called the hotel a few times to confirm the details of my reservations and requests I made. We requested for an early check in, a late check out and a roll away bed, as there were 3 of us traveling. We got to the hotel around 10:00 am. The hotel was beatutiful, has the elegant old world charm of Spanish colonial times. And being that it is a small hotel, it has the homey feel of a large mansion. The ladies at the front office/reception were very nice. We were told that our room was not ready as it was still occupied and need to be cleaned and should be ready by noon. At this time, I have mentioned my request for the rollaway bed (1st request). I was told it will be taken care of. So we put our luggages in the holding area and went to the courtyard which was lovely and had drinks and we were admiring the hotel architecture. The bartender and the concierge at the courtyard restaurant were very welcoming. I went back to the reception around 11:00 to check if the room was ready, it was not. So we went out to lunch and came back around 1:30 and we were able to get into a room. The room was beautiful, spacious and had a nice view of the cobble stoned streets below. The bathroom was clean but noticed that there was no extra roll of toilet paper (there were 3 of us in the room). And no rollaway bed. I went outside our room to ask the housekeeper we saw in the hallway for a rollaway bed (2nd time). He said, I must let the reception know, which I have already done so. Meanwhile, my cousin just realized that she left a bag at the port. She called reception ASAP and a lady named Christine helped her right away, called the cruiseline and the 'lost and found' at the port. We thought that was really great. On our way out to pick up my cousin's bag and walk around Old San Juan, we stopped by reception to thank Christine and mentioned the rollaway bed (3rd time). Came back to the hotel around 6:00 and enjoyed their complimentary wine and cheese hour. Went to our room and again, no roll away bed. Rested for awhile and headed back out to look for a place to eat, went back to reception and asked to reccommendation. They were very helpful and pleasant. I mentioned that there was no rollaway bed (4th time). This time, the lady asked me if I want it at that moment. I said not really, since we were on our way out to dinner but would like to have it placed in the room when we get back. Got back around 9:30 10:00 pm , and guess what? No rollaway bed. Now I'm annoyed, called the reception right away (5th time) and even they were surprised that at this point in time, there's still no rollaway bed. Since we we exhausted from the day's activities, I just wanted to lie down. I pulled the bed covers and first thing I noticed was the bed sheets did not look fresh and clean. I grabbed the pillow and I was just shocked, the pillow case had stain on it. In my mind, this could not be for a supposedly small luxury hotel. I called housekeeping, a lady answered and told her about the sheets and pillow case. I even asked her to come see it for herself. Meanwhile the housekeeper came with the rollaway and the first thing he said to us was 'it was not my fault', not very professional, I thought. I then showed him the bed sheets and pillow case and asked him if he thinks they were clean? And of course, after he saw the stain on the pillow, he had no response. A lady supervisor came and explained that it was cleaned last night. Of course, they were cleaned the night before for the previous guests, but they were not replaced for the next guests (us) after the previous guests checked out. She did apologize, but I thought it was a stupid excuse. She left, and a houskeeper came back with 1 sheet set, and asked me if I want the other beds changed too? Of course, we do. Then, another housekeeper came with the extra sheets and another guy who seem be wearing a security uniform which I thought was weird. He did not do anything but stood at one corner, while the housekeepers were changing the beds. I even asked the housekeeper, if that was his bodyguard? He did not respond. We got up the next morning, and one by one we showered. As the 3rd person showered, the bath tub was clogged and now we run out of toilet paper. I don't remember whether I called housekeeping about the clogged tub and the toilet paper or if I mentioned it to the receptionist on our way out to breakfast? But nevertherless, they fixed the tub and gave us 1 extra roll of paper which was placed on the table instead of replacing the empty roll in the bathroom. I know that is a minor detail, but it they claim that they are a small luxury hotel, small detail like that is what makes a luxury hotel stand miles apart from the big chain hotels. The hotel is beautiful and the location is really great. I'm not quite sure if I will stay there again.

It is located directly across a blue-sheen cobblestone street from San Juan Cathedral, the city's main Catholic Church. The hotel was recommended to us for our one-night stay prior to our cruise by the Royal Caribbean agent, and it is a treasure. The El Convento is luxuriously appointed, and with its open-air lobby and halls, it was always cool and breezy. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 2pm, but check-in was not until 3pm. The desk clerk provided us with a heavy key for the elevator that allowed us to get up to their beautiful 3rd floor and take advantage of all their amenities. They had drinks on ice, a small library with one computer, quiet patio space overlooking a garden and the cathedral, and a small plunge pool/hot tub area with view of the ocean. We ventured down Calle de Cristo, just a couple of blocks, and went into an old bar called Maria's that a Puerto Rican friend recommended we try. We ordered cheese nachos and fresh strawberry smoothies. It was a nice way to start the trip. At 4pm we went back to the hotel, but the room was still not ready. We were told that they had been at capacity last night and were having trouble making up all the rooms. I asked them to please call me on my cell phone when the room was ready. They provided us with a map and recommended a fabulous restaurant that served vegetarian food, Cafe Berlin, on Calle de San Francisco, just a 15-minute walk from the hotel. Here we enjoyed a veggie version of Argentinean steak with loads of wine-soaked veggies. It was perfect, and I'd recommend the clean, elegant, and easily affordable Cafe Berlin to vegetarians and carnivores alike. The room was finally ready at 6pm. This was outrageous, but I have to admit\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe room was worth the wait. You entered from an open-air hall that overlooked a cheery restaurant with trees dripping white lights. From our balcony you could see multi-colored row houses that made for some amazing pictures. The sheets were luxuriously soft; the ceilings high.

My hubby went upstairs to the free wine and cheese hosting they do every evening and brought me down some to try...but I was fast asleep, and I didn't wake up until morning. For breakfast, try La Bombonera--also on Calle de San Francisco, just 10 minutes on foot.

The bed was small. The bathroom was small. We booked a queen bed room. We have a queen bed at home and I know a queen bed. This was not a queen bed. I was assured by the front desk that it was, but it wasn't. If it was a full, rather than a double bed, I'd be surprised. She assured me that all the other rooms had the same beds. I doubted this but decided to stay put rather than ask for a new Now I am fairly small, but I actually fell out of this bed. And no, it did not involve sangria or other delicious beverage. It was just too small a bed to roll over in. It is pretty funny now, but I had a huge bruise, as the tile floor was not a good landing pad. (nor were my high heel wedge sandals). I recommend you not roll over in bed. There was a little table with little chairs. No place to relax in the room. But that was ok, because here's where the hotel gets good... even great! The hotel property: Oh my! How wonderful!! This hotel's charm lies outside the rooms, in nooks and crannies all over the hotel. There is a lovely little plunge pool, on a nice sliver of a terrace with loungers with towel service. There is a covered area with tables and chairs adjacent to the pool area, and another beautiful covered terrace with tables and cushioned chairs where you can enjoy a glass of wine, beer, coffee or tea from the honor bar area just inside. There is another long sun deck overlooking the interior courtyard and each floor of the hotel has chairs, tables outside of each room on a wide corridor that rings the courtyard. This is where we sat almost any time we were not out and about wandering Old San Juan. There is a little library, and no doubt we missed some other little hidden corners to sit and read or just enjoy this great little property. Activities: We used the 'beach club' service, and found the sister property to be a nice alternative for a day. The front desk arranged everything and made the day easy and seamless. The beach was ok, not great. But the beach service (umbrella, chairs and facilities at the hotel) were quite nice. We thought we would hit the beach more than we did, but Old San Juan was just such a joy to explore. There are plenty of touristy souvenir stores for the cruise ship day trippers, but there are also many excellent art galleries, excellent restaurants and sights to see. El Morro was a surprise and well worth the walk. Incredible views of the roiling sea at the harbor into San Juan and La Perla. Walking outside the city wall to the city gate, and back up into the town was well worth the time. Old San Juan was fascinating and was excellent for walking. (caveat - not so excellent for walking in heels.) Narrow little blue cobblestone streets, interesting architecture, beautiful balconies brimming with flowers and plants. Loved it! Dining: The hotel has some excellent restaurants. But there are so many great places to eat in walking distance, make sure you get out and taste the town. In fact, everything is within walking distance.

The hotel is not a beach resort. It is wonderfully located in the most historic part of Old San Juan. The location across from the cathedral and very near to the primary shopping areas allows for walking nearly everywhere in the old city--the museums, restaurants, historic buildings and waterfront. There is a free shuttle bus loop should you tire of walking, or want to begin your day at the far end of town. The hotel is an historic building begun in the 17th century, and was one of the early historic preservation efforts in the old town when it was converted from commercial use to hotel in the 1960s by a member of the Woolworth family. Today it has just over 50 rooms, plus a lovely terrace and plunge pool on the roof with harbor and town views, a nice gathering area where wine and cheese are generously served each evening, restaurants and meeting facilities. Our room was not large, but we had access to so many other facilities--including nice tables in the open air hallways of the hotel--that it did not much matter. The bathroom was also quite small, as is often the case with historic hotels. If you are looking for space, this is not the place for you. The furniture was dated, but the room was clean and had doors that opened to a harbor view. There was an up-to-date flat screen TV and complimentary hard-wire internet access (as well as a computer in the library for those not traveling with their own). Linens were clean, and towels were promptly replaced during turn down service. Air conditioning was just adequate, and would definitely be a concern in warmer months. The hotel building and furnishings are comfortable, not lavish, but the staff is exceptional. The evening wine reception was truly a chance to meet and interact with staff and other guests, not the usual one glass of cheap wine and run. We enjoyed our fellow travelers and talking with staff, and we got lots of pointers on restaurants and things to do. Judith, the front desk manager who is originally from Sweden but has 17 years in Puerto Rico, was particularly welcoming as well as wonderfully efficient. She and the entire staff team never failed to be welcoming, courteous and helpful. That put the real luxury into the stay. There is access to a beach club at Isla Verde, which is actually the Marriott Courtyard Hotel, adjacent to the airport. This requires a $20+tip taxi ride each way, but once there we were treated very well and the beach was superb. You can sign for food expenses at the Marriott that are billed back to your El Convento account, so you need not carry much money or credit cards for your time on the beach. We dined twice at the in-house Tapas restaurant, a nice follow-up to the healthy serving of cheeses at the wine reception. Breakfast in the courtyard was very good with good service, but the morning kitchen is very slow. Our 5 night stay was at rack rate in high season, so it was not inexpensive. The hotel is used by cruise lines for pre-departure stays, and some travelers reported much-discounted room rates...but only for one night. We felt that we received good value due to location, historic ambience and the very special treatment given by all of the staff. If you want a beach resort, or the most up to date interior design, El Convento is not for you.

Just past the Dooney and Bourke store is a great place to have an afternoon frozen drink and a taco. It is called Maria's and they serve the best drinks in San Juan. Up the street from the hotel (towards El Morro) is a great place to grab a hamburger called El Patio De Sam. Fort El Morro is within walking distance and we took the free shuttle service to other Fort. Upon returning to the hotel at 1 p.m. our room was still not ready so we waited in the beautiful courtyard of the hotel. They have bar service there so you can get a refreshing drink while you wait. Our room was ready at 3 p.m. and we were given Room 103 which was a little hard to find since there are only three rooms on the first floor and it has an entrance around the corner from the elevator. The room was large with two queen beds, a full bath and separate room with a shower. The mattress left a lot to be desired. Upon sitting down, every spring in the mattress could be felt. Needless to say I spent two sleepless nights in San Juan. Another problem was the toilet. Usually a toilet seat covers the toilet bowl. This toilet seat was about an inch smaller than the bowl and moved all over the place. On our second day in San Juan we came back from a tour to find the room next door had put their lunch trays in the hall on a table. When we departed 24 hours later, they were still there. The food was starting to smell. When we checked out, I mentioned all of the above to the lady at the front desk and she apologized and said she would have someone check on it. All in all the hotel is very nice and located in a great area for sightseeing and shopping. I am not sure I would stay there again due to the three problems I listed above.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel but expected more\u201d", "Author": "savesthadayagain", "ReviewID": "UR12474983", "Content": "My husband and I arrived at El Convento on Christmas day 2007 for the first part of our honeymoon. I booked our accommodations through whatahotel.com, a website that was suggested on another couple's review. I was happy that I booked with whatahotel.com because I received a fair rate in addition to several other perks: early check-in (when available), late check-out (when available), free upgrade (when available), continental breakfast vouchers for two daily, a $50 credit towards meals at the Patio del Nispero restaurant, as well as a $25 credit towards a massage at the hotel. We arrived at the hotel around 11 a.m. on Christmas day and we were greeted by our favorite hotel employee, Roberto. He congratulated us on our marriage and told us that our room was ready and we were able to check in early. I believe check-in time is usually 3 p.m. so this was a great perk for us. We had room 516 on the top floor which had a partial ocean view. The room was nicely decorated, however I was surprised that nothing special was done for our honeymoon. One criticism of the room was that the front door's handle was very loose and we had a hard time opening our door from both the inside and outside. For the second day of our trip, the 26th, my husband and I planned a catamaran snorkeling tour. We booked it ourselves but asked one of the front desk attendants to book us a taxi for 7:30 a.m. the next day. She assured us that we did not need to book a taxi because taxis line up outside of the hotel every morning. To our dismay, Alessandra (I believe her name was) was wrong and there wasn't a single taxi outside. We had a time schedule that we needed to keep in order to make it to another hotel in the Condado area at 8 a.m. When we didn't see any taxis outside, we spoke to another front desk attendant who called up a taxi for us and we were on our way. The fourth day of our stay at El Convento, we came back to a room that had not been cleaned even though we left the \"Housekeeping please service\" sign on our doorknob. Instead, the \"housekeeping please service\" sign was turned around to \"privacy please\", the bed linens were still unmade and the dirty towels were still on the bathroom floor. However, the garbage cans in the bathroom and room were emptied and to top it off, the hair dryer that I had left in the bathroom was put away in the hair dryer bag in one of the bureau drawers which contained my undergarments. My husband and I were puzzled to say the least. We went down to the front desk and told the desk attendants what had happened. One of the attendants, Talia, brushed it off and even hinted that \"ghosts\" might have done it since it has been rumored that El Convento is \"haunted\". Luckily, Roberto appeared and was very concerned and made sure that a maid went up right away to clean our room. The last day of our stay at El Convento was the 29th and we were able to check-out one hour later at 1 p.m. When we went down to the front desk to check-out I asked one of the attendants about my bill. As with all hotels, you must present the hotel with a credit card which they keep on file in case of any incidentals. When I gave my credit card the first day, I made sure that nothing was charged on that credit card and that it was only held for incidentals. My father's gift to us was our honeymoon and wanted everything to be charged to his credit card. Well, the entire bill was charged to my credit card even after I stated that I wanted nothing billed to my credit card and that it only be held for incidentals. Finally, after repeating this to the attendant several times and her having to \"see\" if she could have the general manager remove it, it was done. Instead of the attendant being polite and making sure that the charge was removed immediately and charged to another card, she kept asking me to sign the \"Guest Folio\" or guest bill. I refused to until I had a new bill printed up which reflected the credit to my MasterCard. Additionally, if you do not ask, the attendants will not tell you that you can use the $50 credit towards meals that you charged to your room. As previously mentioned, when you book with whatahotel.com they guarantee that you will receive certain perks such as a $50 credit per stay towards meals at Patio del Nispero or room service. After I showed the attendant a copy of my hotel confirmation, she took it again to the general manager's office to \"see\" what she could do for me. Again, the charge was taken off. During our stay, Roberto stood out as one of the best hotel employees. When we would pass the front desk he would always ask us how our day was, if we did anything interesting, what restaurants we ate at, etc. He was very hospitable and concerned and made us feel as if we were talking to one of our friends. All in all, the atmosphere of El Convento is extraordinary. If you are into antiques and boutique hotels, El Convento is the hotel for you. If you do not want to be bothered by a lot of loud tourists with children, again, El Convento is the hotel for you. My husband and I loved the patios around the hotel and on our last day there, bought cheese and crackers and a bottle of wine from the local supermarket, SuperMax and enjoyed it on the rooftop patio beneath the stars. We never felt like the hotel was crowded and felt like the only people there most of the time.

They couldn't even figure out how to turn off the message light, so it kept on blinking. Finally, in the evening, the desk clerk knew exactly what to do, and fixed the problem in a few seconds. The first room that we were taken to was fairly large, but the air conditioner was obviously being worked on (part of the ceiling insulation was on the floor), and the bellhop immediately called the desk to assign us another room. That room was very small and dark - and not exceptionally clean. The time was getting close to midnight, and after a delayed flight and a time change of four hours, we just wanted to get to sleep. The wine and cheese hour was very nice with a nice selection of wines and cheeses. We love Old San Juan, and El Convento is in a very convenient location. We were able to walk to San Cristobal Fort and took the free trolley to El Morro Fort. The hotel is close to the only remaining city gate. It is also close to lots of shopping.

We visited PR to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary, it was our first trip there. Check-in was painless, but we soon found one of the room keys did not work. We reported this, someone came up to look at it, he promised to bring us another key and never saw him again; this left us with one key. Due to owning our own business, we need to use the Internet for a couple of hours daily, this is a necessity for us. We logged on, no Internet, we tried and tried, no Internet that first night, the front desk clerk said there was a communications problem. Next morning, no new key, no Internet. Clerk said Internet was down in this whole area, some problem with the phone company. Finally came on late afternoon, worked OK. A clerk came up with several keys, none worked. He came back with more keys, one worked, he said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be back soon with a key chain and a new key. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see him for hours. Finally another one showed up, tried several keys and was able to get us a working key around 7 p.m. on our second night. While I was at the office asking how to retrieve voice mails because I had tried several times and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t retrieve them following instructions given to me, a tourist walked in all distressed because her key was stuck in her door and her husband couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the room open. She asked for someone to please come up right away to which I replied that the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to exist in PR, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whenever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hotel has a wine/cheese function every evening from 6 to 7, we went the second night here, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just wine, 3-4 cheeses, crackers and grapes, no big deal, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suggest changing your plans just so you can attend this free function. Hotel has an honors bar area on the 3rd floor with bottled water, juices, peanuts, and I believe beer and wine, you take what you need and jot it down on a notepad so they can charge your room. The elevator leading up to the rooms is well protected from people off the street, you must have your room key to access the elevator, this was a good feature since there are homeless people all around the Old San Juan area. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small park across from the hotel and, of course, a few homeless persons congregate there, the elevator safety feature is great. The room has a small refrigerator with 2 bottles of water, coffee maker & coffee, a safe, a closet, a nice desk with an uncomfortable, low chair on which I had to put beach towels to elevate me to a comfortable typing height, a large dresser, a very good and big LG flat screen TV, two night stands, plenty of light, long colonial wood windows with shutters you can open and close to let daylight in, a curtain by the window, a small round eating table with 2 chairs, and a thick clear glass door which closes off the room from the entryway/closet area which we assume must be there to keep out the noise other guests may make while they sit on the tables placed on the open terrace directly outside the rooms. We slept well, everything works fine in the bathroom, plenty of towels and basic toiletries, plenty of wood hangers and 2 robes. We found the hotel to be a lovely, old hotel which has been wonderfully restored. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of history in this hotel which is located directly across from a very old church (founded in the 1500's) and a small park. Valet parking is across the street, $20/day. Employees are helpful and courteous. Two female employees came around at night to ask if we needed water, ice, toiletries, towels, etc.. Walking on the cobblestone streets is hard on the feet, wear comfortable walking shoes! Many times you have to climb up steep streets....get in shape before making this trip. The streets are very narrow; if you will be driving, bring the smallest possible car you can bring, trucks such as F150's are quite difficult to maneuver on the streets, to make the narrow turns and are very hard to park. Bringing an umbrella might be a good idea, it rained heavily on and off while we were there. If you will be driving or taking taxis, get used to very long waits in traffic which just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move, 20 minutes while moving 4 inches is not unusual, we spent 2.5 hours on a two lane expressway (Hwy. 30) which drivers turned into a 4 lane highway on their own with some of them driving down steep embankments to get away from the traffic jam or tapon as they call it in PR. Everyone says you should plan to leave for the airport at least 3 hours prior to your flight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure because of traffic and because of how long their security check-in takes. We ate at El Jibarito where prices ranged from $7 to $15 for dinner, food was OK, nothing spectacular, casual clothing is OK. We had breakfast at La Bombonera which has been in its present location for 105 years, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bakery and a luncheonette, they close at 6 p.m., breakfast was OK and under $5, the pastries were very good, you can ask for breakfast once breakfast time is over (11 a.m.) by paying an additional dollar, the staff was courteous and friendly. For the fast food or American food crowd, all the standards are around: Burger King, Subway, Wendy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Macaroni Grill, Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Plenty of pharmacies around, as well as dozens of stores and souvenir shops. I was surprised by the large number of jewelry stores. At night there was a strong police presence on the street even when the stores were closed. All in all we had a very pleasant stay at El Convento and would highly recommend it for travelers without children and for romantic getaways.

It is WELL worth the extra money. Looking out over the rooftops and the water is amazing. And because the climate is so prone to short rainstorms, it's quite a site to watch the clouds roll in and the lightning start! Breakfast in the garden patio every morning was beautiful, with perfect service and delcious food (it's costly, but there's no where else to get breakfast in San Juan practically). The \"tapas hour\" every night on the promenade was our highlight. Delicious cheeses and wines and a nice seat outdoors - it was heaven. We used the concierge to book a trip to El Yunque for us and to call taxis a few times - it was a great service. Everything about this hotel was romantic and classy and wonderful....except - when the other cruisers checked in. On Friday (and worse on Saturday) - a total barrage of Cruisers took over the hotel. The fact that it was \"crowded\" was unpleasant, but more than that (and i'm about to sound snobby) was that so many of the cruisers seemed \"out of place\" at El Convento - they were loud, they were dressed inappropriately, they had throngs of screaming children, etc. When you're shelling out this much money to stay at a \"luxury\" hotel, you don't expect it to turn into a holiday inn overnight. For example: El convento has an \"honor bar\" - where they leave out bottles of booze, mixers, soda, snacks, etc with a little sign that says \"this is an honor bar, if you make something for yourself, please fill out a receipt and leave it in this box - your room will be charged\" - on Wednesday and Thursday night the honor bar was \"honored\" - on Friday and Saturday my husband and I watched as handfulls of new guests (cruisers) stole from the bar - many of them laughing about it while they were doing it. some of them going so far as to grab armfulls of bottled soda and water and carry it back to their room!

Directions and recommendations for restaurants, churches, museum's, etc professionally given. Valets and Porters(who all speak English) quick and attentive and on more than one occasion in the elevators they mentioned that we shouldn't miss the free cheese and wine being held each evening from 6-7pm, which was superb by the way. Rooms, spotlessly clean, authentically Spanish in design(as is the whole Hotel). Maid service, prompt, smiling, efficient and turndown service was also included and found this to be more superior than many other top-rated hotels we have stayed at. Room service was answered quickly and delivered quickly and again, always with a smile. What the hotel website doesn't make abundantly clear is that outside each one of the rooms, you have your own table and chairs, where you can drink, eat and smoke(if you wish)whilst enjoying the fabulous views of their 300 year old nispero fruit tree from Spain and all the other plants, whilst refreshing breezes and great music wafts the senses. On the third floor one finds complimentary tea, coffee, iced water and assorted nuts(24 hours) plus an extensive honour bar and a Library that houses free internet services. As mentioned before, you can read all of this in other reviews..what I want to bring to the traveller who has not visited San Juan or indeed the El Convento is a Hotel that clearly strives to stand out from all the rest and actually achieves this difficult task by offering the kind of atmosphere and service, be it in any of their many outstanding Restaurants or from difficult to simple requests, that sometimes get that scorned Caribbean frowned upon look elsewhere in this part of the world. We have all been there, havent we? I have actually seen Management walk around and talk to the guests, asking how their stay is or was and can they do anything more for them? So if one is able to find a hotel that is fanatical about making sure their guests come first, no matter what and always trying to improve(as nothing runs like clockwork), plus have possibly the best position in all of downtown San Juan, followed by stunning hotel scenery and authentic culture, well one just hopes that one can return in the near future. I know I will. Finally, if you are the sort of person who relishes glitz, gambling, noise and hob-nobbing with people, especially around the usual brash pool, go elsewhere.

Oh, and they scanned the room to anticipate possible problems for me and then determined that they would remove all the area rugs and move the furniture to insure my safety. During the nightly wine reception, the managers would place an extra chair for my leg, sit me down and would proceed to bring me my favorite wine, a plate with a generous serving from their extensive selection of cheese and crackers, and a bundle of grapes to top the plate. As I progressed from being in a boot with two crutches to being able to walk unassisted (a period of over four months) they celebrated with me and applauded me as I would show off my steps.

We asked the front desk and they knew nothing of it. Additionally, we inquired about a scooter rental at the front desk. The concierge said he would look into it and never followed up with us. The next morning we ordered orange juice and was charged $12 for one glass!! The only newspaper they offered could only be read in the lobby. After these bad experiences we tried to cancel our third night while we were in Antigua. The front desk kept on transferring me to a reservations line where no one picked up. Finally after asking to speak with the manager they said we could not cancel less then 72 hours before the stay. We explained that we already stayed there two nights at almost $400 a night and they still would not allow us to cancel without being charged. After arriving in San Juan for our third night in the city we were forced to return to the hotel since they already charged us. Once we got there we had to request the manager again and only after stressing that our stay was unpleasant and that we felt like we were being forced to stay at their crappy hotel did they credit us. This was all done in the lobby in front of other guests and I believe they only gave in because of this. I found this hotel on the \"Small Luxury Hotels of the World\" listings, the hotel claims to be a \"4 star luxury\" hotel yet we were greatly disappointed due the poor treatment we received and the just average standard of the rooms.

Most of this made the grade, but we, strangely, SWEATED and felt uncomfortable sleeping all four nights, (room temp OK) until the last night, when I finally thought, \"What IS that stiff crackle of a feeling?\" I pulled off the sheets to find a plastic coated mattress pad, the kind they use in hospitals, the kind you use with kids who still wet the bed! I nicely asked the maid about it and she said it was to protect the expensive mattresses. So here we are with heavenly sheets and plastic underneath. And, to boot, the mattress pad looked old and icky. I've never seen or felt anything like it in any classy hotel I've been in anywhere in the world.

But the many lounging alcoves and the unique setting make up for any slight deficiencies. About the only negative thing I can say is that the front desk seemed to have only one person working. Since it functions as concierge, reservationist, as well as front desk the lone worker is at times overwhelmed. This resulted in a dinner reservation request not being made until I made the request again. This isn't to say the staff was incompetant or uncaring, he was just overwhelmed.

The lobby was impressive with soaring ceilings and a patterned marble floor. The courtyard is lush with tropical vegetation and acres of terra cotta tile.

Both settings are in the courtyard and very romantic. The service was very good in both cases. We appreciated the morning newspapers (including the New York Times) that were available in the breakfast room. There was a pianist playing in the lobby salon at night. We ate at a nearby restaurant called Amadeus. It is within a short walk. The appetizers were great: corn fritters with mozzarella and dumplings. The main courses were bland and uninteresting. dessert was excellent: cheese flan. There was a good wine list. El Convento is located in the heart of Old San Juan. The area really comes alive at night. During the day, it is dominated by typical tourist shops. There are a couple of small legitimate antique shops but mostly the usual tourist stuff. The staff is very attentive and efficient. . The fitness center is small but has two treadmills, nautilus and some free weights. It is also open 24 hours a day The internet connection was excellent.

Hotel El Convento is definitely more than we tend to spend on our hotel rooms, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very glad we splurged. Resort-type places aside, it is the nicest full-service hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in and I have to say that I would be hard pressed to stay anyplace else in OSJ in the future. The location is perfect for walking around, the courtyard of the hotel is a peaceful place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and a book in the early morning, and the views from the rooftop pool and decks were just lovely. Our room had two double beds, a flatscreen TV, a Bose CD player, small refrigerator, small safe, full bathroom, air conditioning, and a small Juliet balcony whose doors we could throw wide open to see the plaza right below us and the cathedral to our left. Every staff member, from the concierge to the bartenders to the bellhop exuded graciousness and made us feel welcome in a solicitous but not overbearing way. Included with the price of the room is an outdoor, early evening rooftop wine and cheese reception, which we were very glad to take advantage of. Our flight from Vieques was timed so that it would have been very difficult to eat an early lunch before hand, and our arrival at El Convento was such that their restaurant had stopped serving lunch already, and we did not want to eat a full meal at 3:45 pm, so the reception was ideal. The hotel provided a wide variety of hard and soft cheeses and other nibbles, plus a choice of about 6 different wines, an honor bar for those who want a cocktail, as well as coffee, tea, bottled water and soda. So the adults sat with our wine and martinis and our teenager with her soda as we watched a cruise ship leave port and saw the clouds to the west become tinted with the pastels of sunset. Check-out is at noon, but the hotel provides a secure closet for leaving behind luggage if, like us, you have a late afternoon flight and want to spend the time walking around OSJ. Guests who have already checked out can still take advantage of all of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facilities, so we also had access to the pool but more importantly to the shower rooms in the fitness center so that we could change clothes before leaving for the airport. Our breakfast in the courtyard of the hotel was quite good, accompanied by excellent coffee, which my husband and I drank while waiting for our companions to join us. The fare was varied and priced in keeping with hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prices. For our evening meal we walked down to Aguaviva, which served us some of the best seafood and cocktails we've ever enjoyed--the watermelon sangria was especially good. All in all, we loved Old San Juan and we hope to return sooner rather than later. The next time one of our flights to the Caribbean has a nasty layover (Grenada being the worse) we will definitely just plan to overnight in OSJ and stay at El Convento again.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cA taste of the Old World in the Caribbean...\u201d", "Author": "kzdallas", "ReviewID": "UR5187140", "Content": "We loved El Convento!

You can easily walk from the hotel to all the historic sites in OSJ --El Morro, San Cristobal, the governor's house, San Juan Cathedral, the home of Ponce de Leon, etc.-- and to numerous shops and restaurants. There are duty free jewelry stores on every block, boutiques selling clothes and local handicrafts, outlet shops, and unusual and interesting art galleries. And the restaurants are superb. Most are small and unique. Dragonfly has incredible Latin-Asian fusion food (great sushi). The Parrot Club makes the best pork sandwich in the world -- and the Parrot Passion is quite refreshing! Agua Viva is open for lunch and dinner and serves good Latin inspired seafood (I loved the calamari sandwich and the big steel bowls of ceviche looked really tasty). Tantra is an exotic Latin-Indian restaurant, La Bombanero serves mallorcas fresh from the oven at breakfast time. This is a local spot which is more than 100 years old and looks like a cafe/diner/bakery combination...the coffee's great, too. Baru on San Sebastian Street is very good Mediterranean/Caribbean food and the Cafe Puerto Rico is good, cheap PR food. And the best tapas in the world are served at El Picoteo in the El Convento Hotel. We had a variety for dinner one night and had to go back the next day at lunch for more! They also make a superb Tres Leches cake and chocoloate mousse cake. You can have dinner at 7:00, hop in a cab and head to Isle Verde to the Casinos -- the Ritz, El San Juan, Intercontinental or many others -- and come back to El Convento afterward for coffee and dessert! The next time you have to change planes in San Juan to get to the Virgin Islands, Antigua, St. Martin, Aruba, Barbados...or other points south, think about a stopover in Puerto Rico.

Other complaints were they lost our laundry (found eventually), and the telephone did not work. When we did manage to make a call, the pen did not work! However, that did not mean we did not enjoy our stay. Staff at the front desk was always helpful, especially Carmen, and other staff were always pleasant. The design and ambience of the hotel are stunning, at the centre of a beautiful historic city. The complimentary bar between 6 and 7pm is a lovely idea, and although the pool is small, the deck area has a beautiful aspect and is a pleasant place to relax.

We selected the hotel, as we like Old San Juan and were pretty much able to walk anywhere to shop or dine. We were celebrating our tenth wedding anniversary. We had booked the room through the cruiseline. Upon checking in after a long day, we were told the only room available had twin beds. We explained that we had requested a room with a queen sized bed. They stated they had no other rooms, but would try to get us another room the next day. I am not sure where the mixup took place. I did contact the cruiseline who stated a queen sized bed was requested. ???? We had to take the room. Upon retiring for the night, the toilet in the room overflowed all over. We had not even used the toilet as of yet. Water was everywhere. We called the front desk and they sent a maintenance person up. It took him awhile, but apparently he fixed whatever caused the problem. After he left, the toilet started running and making very strange noises, and would not stop. I called the front desk irate, as it was late, and we were very tired. Miraculously, another room became available after we were told earlier there was nothing available. The person at the front desk stated this room also had twin beds. We immediately took the room, as we were very tired. This room was OK but the hotel really needs to do some upgrading, especially in the rooms. Obviously plumbing is an issue as well. The following day the front desk called and stated a room with a queen sized bed became available, as someone had cancelled. We declined, as we did not feel like packing everything up again. On a positive note, the wine/cheese reception each night was outstanding. A nice assortment of cheeses and wine. Cafe Bohemio was excellent as well. One last note. The hotel is all open. We do prefer at times to be in air conditioning, as the heat bothers us at times. The only place we found air conditioned areas was in the rooms. All dining areas are in the open.

This was the last leg of our trip after spending a week over at St. Johns and we were not disappointed. The service was stellar... The woman at the front desk (can't recall her name but she had braces :)) had taken note that it was our honeymoon, congratulated us and then put us in what many considered the best room in the house on the 5th floor. Since this was the first time someone actually really acknowledged with some excitement on us being newlyweds and went out of their way to find a great room, make us reservations on the spot for dinner, etc... it really meant a lot to us and really set the tone for the rest of our stay - great service. The room itself (I *think* 508) had been featured in many magazines with two windows/doors that had a view of the bay and also the pool area. The room was extremely tasteful and well thought out in terms of color scheme, decorations and furniture... along with being extremely clean. On our first night we took advantage of a pre-dinner snack at the nightly free cheese and wine hour only to come back to our room afterwards to find our bed turned down with rose pedals put into the shape of a heart on our bed (very nice touch). Several moments later there was a knock on our door with a bottle of champange and truffles. The inner courtyard was very nice, with breakfast in the morning and a tappas bar overlooking looking it - which ended up being our favorite place for drinks and snacks as the food was excellent. The location of the hotel itself in Old San Juan is perfect with walking distance to the shops and several execellent restaurants. If you want to go a bit further there is always a taxi out front. One night we took a taxi over to the Sheraton at Isle Verde for dinner and the casino, 15 minute ride at about $18, a little expensive but still reasonable. We would definitely stay again (in fact already setting up our next trip) and have absolutely nothing negative to say about the hotel or service of the resort... and I consider myself picky.

After informing the front desk of this problem, we were disappointed that the staff tried to pass it off as condensation from the air conditioning. The leaks are so bad that at one point it soaked the bed on one side! We have since pulled our bed from the wall to avoid sleeping on a water bed and placed towels on the floor (by the way, housekeeping keeps replacing our towels even though we hang them up daily to show that we would like to keep them). Having said all that, we were moved from a standard room to a junior suite on our second night here even though we booked for a deluxe room (which is a really nice bonus). Unfortunately it is the suite that is leaking but wild horses wouldn't drag us out of here for the space! The Tapas bar at the hotel is very good and has great ambience.

Upon showing them proof, we were happily given room 501. During our first night, San Juan experiened more than average rainfall and our room had a couple leaks (one in the bathroom and one from the ceiling); Also we were unable to make telephone calls to the US mainland through the telephone system from the rooms. We informed the desk of our problems of leakage and were cheerfully transferred to room 510, which had a better view of San Juan Bay. This room was very satisfactory and nicely appointed with it's decor. Our CD player did not work, however. The room was clean and comfortable. Dining at The Elconvento was a bit 'iffy' as the Bistro was closed for refurbishing. We enjoyed our breakfast each morning in the inner courtyard (when it was not raining)..however, breakfast was a bit high-priced ($39 for two of bacon and eggs, toast, juice and coffee). There were a few times the lift did not work as well. We are assuming that the heavy rains were responsible for the malfunction. The pub, El Picateo was lovely and offers not only drinks but light snacks such as tappas and sandwiches. In the evening dinners are available as well. Rich Puerto Rican music wafts through the bar and restaurant sitting. From 6-7PM is free wine/cheese offerings. The cheeses were nothing special, however, the many wines were lovely. The corridors are lovely and the terraces are beautifully lit. Many different plants, flowers, and trees line the hallways and terraces, giving a romantic air to the hotel. The swimming pool and hot tub are very small, but clean and there is ample area for sunning. There is a lovely view from the swimming area as well as the terraces. There is free internet access in the library. Hotel Elconvento is centrally situated nicely in Old San Juan and in convenient walking distance to all attractions. The city is very hilly, so wear comfortable footwear! Just a few blocks away from the hotel is a trolley (small bus) that will transport you throughout the city for free. There is no need to rent a car if Old San Juan is where you are going to stay for the entire trip. We hired a driver for one day to take us on a tour, visit the Bacardi Rum Distillery, and treated us to an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant for lunch. The cost of this was $120 for 5 hours. There were other tours the concierge desk (same people as the front desk) offers, but dont hesitate to ask to make up your own package. They are most accommodating. All in all, we found the Hotel Elconvento staff very helpful and friendly. For a 350 year old building, it is well maintained and has more than enough staff to meet your needs. We were a bit disappointed by the housekeeping staff. They made up the bed each day, but towels were not replaced as needed.

The wedding guests brought their party to the hallways and the pool area and loudly carried on until 5:30 am. The air conditioner was a bit noisy, so it thankfully drowed out some of the noise, but it was a bit ridiculous. So, I suggest if there is any function, such as a wedding in the hotel, ask for a room towards the back of the hotel to avoid a possible sleepless night. I know some people have commented about the pool being extremely small. Well, it is, but we happened to be the only people there most the time.

They didn't come that day or any other. After a week of excuses I used a coin to remove the screws holding the grill, reached in and fixed it myself. Noise can be a problem. Most rooms are situated away from the busy street but noise echos around the small streets easily. My room was fitted with an extra window pane that cut down the noise but did not eliminate it. A bigger problem was the Hotel's practice of renting ground floor space for wedding receptions and other functions on the weekends. The noise from one party did not end until after one AM. I would recommend a set of ear plugs just in case. These annoyances aside, I enjoyed my stay and would stay again.", "Date": "May 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poole", "Title": "\u201cWonderful staff.

The El Convento is a lovely hotel in historic Old San Juan, from a visual perspective. It is ideally located for walking around Old San Juan, close to many shops, restaurants, and historic sites. They also have a very nice daily wine and cheese tasting, as well as a nice complimentary continental breakfast in the morning. Unfortunately, for a hotel priding itself on being a member of the \"small luxury hotels of the world\" category, it fails to live up to those expectations of luxury when it comes to service. We arrived as a post-cruise package around noon, and were told that our rooms weren't quite ready yet and were told to check back in about an hour. That one hour turned into over 3 hours, as rooms were not ready until after 3 pm. The rooms themselves were large and roomy, with a nice-sized bathroom as well. The room my wife and I were given had a malfunctioning air conditioner, (there was also another member in our party whose air conditioning was not working) something we did not bring to the concierge's attention due to us just being so tired the first day, we took a long nap that night. When we did notify the front desk the following morning around 8 am as we were getting ready to go out for the day, we were told that they would get maintenance to check it out. When we returned to the hotel in mid-afternoon, the air conditioning was still not working. When I called again, the concierge said she would speak to her supervisor very quickly and then call me right back. Thirty minutes later after I called them again (and about 10 minutes after my wife had gone down to the desk to speak to them again about the air conditioning), we were told that they would assign us a different room. After 3 different calls to let the porter know we were ready to have our luggage taken to the new room, we were finally situated in a room with temperature control. It seems like a minor irritation, but they (a) either didn't check it out at all after we originally asked them to, or (b) knew it wasn't working and weren't going to do anything about it until we pestered the front desk staff enough. Our check out problems were the the biggest problems, though. Checking out itself wasn't a problem, but catching our taxis to the airport with all of our luggage was another situation. We checked out of the hotel at noon, and had arranged for our luggage to be held (with claim checks) until 1 pm for our transport to the airport. Taxis didn't arrive until closer to 1:30, and only when we got to the airport did we realize that we were missing 2 bags still, one my wife's, one belonging to my sister. My sister had to ride back to the hotel with the taxi driver to pick up the missing luggage, which the hotel staff told her was left on a chair by where we were sitting waiting for the taxis, as though we left them behind and forgot to grab them. I'm still trying to figure out how this could be since they were bags that had been checked in with the porter staff and once we gave the bags to them, they never left their custody. Its obvious that they forgot to pull them when they loaded the taxis, regardless of the excuse they offered of where they found the bags. My best advice for anyone looking to stay at El Convento? Visually pleasing, and ideally located if you want to stay in Old San Juan. However, the quality of service is severly lacking and very indifferent. I'm sure that for the price, you can find better accomodations elsewhere in San Juan, especially in the Isla Verde area. If and when my wife and I return to San Juan, our accomodations will definetly be elsewhere other than El Convento. *Note: This hotel was booked by our travel agent, who acknowledged beforehand she was not strongly familiar with San Juan and its accomodations*", "Date": "May 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fountain Hills, AZ", "Title": "\u201cFabulous, Intimate hotel\u201d", "Author": "marham", "ReviewID": "UR3437927", "Content": "This is a great hotel in Old San Juan -- close to everything -- staff was more than accommodating.

We got a good deal on hotels ($180 per night) and decided to splurge. Check-in was fast, concierge announced we'd gotten an upgrade (cool!) to a partial suite. Our room was 305, and wow was it gorgeous. Two full-length windows looking out on the cathedral plaza, an inlaid-marble dining table with six chairs, several cushy chairs, tv, fridge, sideboard, buffet table, two coffee tables, two chandeliers...it was a large, very medieval-atmosphered suite. There were even tapestries and real candles. The bathroom was small but all marble. But then we noticed the bed--the sofa had been pulled out into a full-size sofa bed. We tried to open the door we assumed went into the bedroom, but it was locked--and we realized what partial suite meant--the doors had been closed and someone else was being rented the bedroom part of the suite for the night. The sofa bed was rather lumpy and small, but we liked the rest of the room so much we decided to deal with it. (We slept terribly, since we both kept falling to the sunken-in middle of the bed). And the person in the room on the other side was laughing along with her tv, so my husband and I had a loud conversation about the weather so she'd realize we could hear her and she quieted down. So that was the only drawback, but we did choose to keep that room rather than switch to another, because we had seen several of those other rooms on the way in, and could tell from that and from the floor plan on our room door that the vast majority of the rooms are quite small, though nicely furnished. The complimentary breakfast included juice, fruit plate, hot or cold cereal, and basket of breads and danishes--much more than we could eat--served in the beautiful courtyard. The 6-8 pm wine and cheese reception is awesome: 8 wines, crackers, 4 cheeses, grapes--we didn't go out for dinner that night because we filled up on their delicious (and free) offerings, which we ate on the rooftop terrace by the pool, listening to the fountains and watching the stars. Even though the hotel is on a plaza, it's so very quiet! And the complimentary water bottles and tea and coffee available at all hours from the lounge area on the third floor was fantastic. Free internet access computer use there too. (Ask for a room on the third floor so you'll have easiest access to all this.) We ate in the hotel's Spanish tapas restaurant, the sangria was amazing, the tapas ok, but very convenient courtyard location after a full day of flying. The concierge was very helpful with suggesting other places to eat, as she had a large book full of restaurant menus. In all, highly recommend, but be prepared for small rooms.

The facilities of this small boutique hotel (member of the prestigeuos Small Luxury Hotels of the World) are gorgeous and clean, including the bathrooms!!

Now, the hotel IS NOT big, after all it was not built to be a hotel but a Carmelite Convent 365 years ago...they were not thinking on sun bathing and big pools. Besides, you won't mind the pool size once you are enjoying of the sun with a roof top view of Old San Juan as your background. It is simply an experience on itself. There is indeed a lot of police around the hotel for a very good reason. The San Juan City Hall, Puerto Rico's Department of Justice and La Fortaleza (the Governor's Mansion) are within 5 blocks of the hotel. La Fortaleza is actually about 2 blocks away and you ought to visit it. It was originally the first Spanish defense fortification in the island until the 1600's when Governors started using it as their residence. Also, El Convento is within walking distace from the cruise pier. The hotel does not have security guards because it does not need them. It is a very safe area. As a matter of fact, we like El Convento so much that we are getting married there this summer.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The staff couldn't have been nicer --they were truly wonderful, turned themselves inside out. Our room, however left a lot to be desired. We stayed in the Casals suite, supposedly one of the nicest suites in the hotel and paid $635/night. While there were some beautiful antiques in the room, the room itself felt very old and tired, the tile on the floor must have been at least 25 years old and so dirty that the dirt was ground in. In areas around the doorways and walls, it was chipping, and looked more like a tenement. The staff at the front desk said the floor in this room was original to the hotel, which I find hard to believe, as that would make it upwards of 350 years old. There was no tile 350 years ago. The bathroom was very small, with no room to store anything, but the shower was great. Marble in the bathroom very old, with very old, dirty caulking around the tub and in between the tiles in the bath. The worst of it was Saturday night -- there was a wedding downstairs that went on to the wee hours of the morning, and it felt like the band was in our room. Impossible to sleep, then at about 5 a.m., some late-leaving drunken guests were screaming outside our window. In all fairness, I asked to see the VAnderbuilt suite. They were very nice about showing it to me and in fact, it looked much cleaner and more comfortable. It had a separate shower, and the floor was a castillo tile, so you could not see ground in dirt. Felt much more cozy and comfortable. Once of the nice things offered by the hotel is a complementary late afternoon cocktail hour -- they serve wine, cheese, crackers, coffee.

Some rooms have views of bay, but other than that, they were normal basic rooms. I noticed that room classifications listed on Expedia weren't accurate, and would recommend booking directly through hotel reservations if you want something different than basic room - which has 2 twin beds. Also, rooms have high-speed internet.", "Date": "September 15, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel El Convento", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d148043-Reviews-Hotel_El_Convento-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$201 - $353*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">100 Cristo St</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Old San Juan</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Juan</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00901</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "148043", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3d/79/3d79cfa0f70986362e6187ffca6d304d4large.jpg"}}
