When I complained, I was given 15m cable left outside of my room without any comment. I assumed it meant to find the router myself and wire the cable to my room. Well, cable is just way too long and you loose connection.To make it worse, I was told more than a few times to call from the station which I did. But you still have to wait outside of the door for a while.I was in newly added (?) apartment. It is clean but has no place to relax, either tiny bedroom or tiny kitchen. Both are clean but you do not want to stay too long.I changed the booking from 4nights to 2nights within 24 hours of booking. Although it was last minute and there were no reservation anyway, I was still charged for cancellation fee.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR969264473", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "000ttt000"}, {"Content": "Good for 4 people Myself and two friends stayed at Bickersbed for 3 nights this August. The website is good and shows the property how it is - although it forgets to mention one thing! Bickersbed has two rooms, one upstairs and one downstairs. They are not completely separate from each other so if you went as a couple you would have another couple staying upstairs.As you go in the house there is a small dining table (shared between both rooms) and two sets of stairs - one down to a small kitchen and the downstairs bedroom and one up to a small gallery kitchen and the upstairs bedroom.We stayed in the downstairs bedroom but had a peek in the upstairs one which was much nicer. The downstairs one is quite dark and only has 2 small windows which look out onto a house (we had a very nosy woman peering in at us one day!).The upstairs room is very light and airy and had a great curved bathroom - ask for this room if you can.The lady who met up was very friendly and told us lots about the area. The actual area of the house is nice and quiet and away from the hussle and bussle of the city. You are about a ten minute walk from Central Station and about fifteen minutes from the red light district. I would recommend the area as we felt safe walking back at night and it was not full of tourists.If you eat at the pub on the corner and order a special sausage sandwich - be prepared for a raw mince burger!!!! My friend ordered this as she didn't know what it was!!!!Overall I would say that Bickersbed is a good place to stay. This is my third visit to Amsterdam and its the best place I hace stayed so far. It would be great for a group of 4 people as you would have your own private house.Explore the area around the house as there are some great boutiques and nice bars and restaurants which are not touristy and offer good food.Hope this helps you to decide where to stay!", "Date": "Sep 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR547462492", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KateQuigley"}, {"Content": "Bellissima sistemazione!   showReview(8372355, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR879476273", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Sonja80"}, {"Content": "g\u8305nial   showReview(6893940, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR352725649", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lizzlily"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d611476-r16778460-BickersBed_Guestrooms-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "611476", "Price": "$148"}}
