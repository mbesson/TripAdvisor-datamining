{"Reviews": [{"Content": "DO NOT STAY HERE When I first booked my trip I did not listen to the other reviews on Trip Advisor and ended up booking this hotel anyway. I should have listened!!! Terrible place to stay. The bathroom smelled of sewage, the sheets were stained, the pool was the worst. The pictures on their website are VERY misleading. The pool was not blue as in the pictures, it was dark brown with dirt. We ended up checking out of the hotel 3 days into our intended 8 night stay. We went and got a room at the hotel right next door, for a cheaper price, and a WAY better room. Listen to the reviews, I wish I had. It would have saved me a bunch of stress when I first arrived in Bali.", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR514554777", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "AshDave13"}, {"Content": "Look elsewhere Don't be fooled by the photos on the websites. This hotel is poorly maintained. Fist sized holes in the mosquito nets which were needed as there were loads of them flying around. The pool is nothing more than a large pond (and dirty too). The bathroom had no hot water and the beds were thin mattreses that smelt of old sweat. The location is good and the staff tried hard but there is no way I would recommend this to anybody else.", "Date": "Aug 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR730014535", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bigboroboy"}, {"Content": "Poorly Maintained The people working at Graha were very friendly, but the accommodation was definitely subpar. There are so many places in Ubud that are better value. The room and bathroom were smelly. Some lights did not work - others did so sporadically. Do not stay here.

My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in November - 2 nights too long. Don't be fooled by the photos or descpription - this place may be cheap, but is not worth your money. The rooms are run-down, the pool is not clean enough to touch, and it takes at least 5 minutes to get any hot water (if any is available). I picked up the infamous 'Bali belly' from the breakfast.FYI, there is no spa at this hotel, regardless if you see it advertised. We pre-paid for a massage and arrvied to find out the spa was no longer. The hotel honored the booking, which was a huge mistake on our part - the massage really hurt, I may never have another.All in all, we wasted 2 nights of our holiday at this place when we could have spent it somewhere else - without a doubt the low-point of an otherwise fabulous holiday in Bali.", "Date": "Jan 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR601000310", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DrOxford"}, {"Content": "No hot water This is a pleasant older hotel with friendly staff.
