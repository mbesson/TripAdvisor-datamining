On the plus side, the hotel is located on the same street as the train station, so it's difficult to get lost. The double room had plenty of space however it is quite basic. There can be a lot of noise from the train station across the road, which is why i suspect they have installed air conditioning units (so the windows can be shut) to minimize the disturbance. It was frustrating not having wifi available in the room and especially annoying that there is a cost of 10 Euros to use the wifi from the reception. As expected, the breakfast is very simple with cereal, bread, juice and coffee/tea. Unfortunately there was no fruit.

That aside, it is rude to blame hotel staff. The astonishingly friendly owner Allesandro and his lovely staff were gracious and kind and seem to have a fondness for Irish guests! Terrific night Manager Bouchaid is in possession of a wealth of knowledge on the city and helped me enormously by directing me to some unique and unusual places, and advised on a particularly difficult glass design I wanted to track down and buy, and unbelievably I found it and bought it. What a treasure this man is for guests who are fortunate enough to find themselves in this unique hotel. The hotel itself is a warm, inviting and lovely place to spend time at. I cannot stress too much how immaculately clean this hotel is, with a beautiful breakfast set up every morning for guests. On the strength of knowing before I arrived that the internet was available in the lobby only, I decided not to take my laptop with me.

He gave us a map, told us directly what trams and buses to get on and was directly helpful from the first day. The hotel was perfect. Like i said, it was down the street from the train station so on a road but the road was not busy and the hotel was not directly on it. There is steps down to the hotel that showed it tucked away from any noise that could be heard. We certainly didnt hear any cars, trains e.t.c The bed was comfortable, the room was okay. A bit of rust on the shower and the towels were like thin bed sheets but thats all i would complain about if i was being picky! But the rust in no way looked bad or falter the function of the shower nor did the sheets prevent you from being dry.. the very opposite! Sky television with the function to change to british language a bonus! We were told wifi but couldnt get it in our room.. maybe downstairs in the seating area i dont know. As for the prostitutes, yes we saw two for the whole trip. One where she was in a the corner of an alley and scurried away soon as she saw a female and the other ran right into my boyfriend ha! But harmless. Never experianced any muggers on this trip like most tourists say. I would say its one of the most less threatening cities ive been too. I mean we walked around at night and saw nothing frightning. We even left our money out of the safe and it was never stolen! Coming out of the hotel if you go to the bottom of the street away from the trains tation, turn right and get to the second street fantastic pizza shop! 6 euro for a full pizza, healthy too! No grease nice bread! To sum up Hotel was fantastic could not fault it. Manager and staff were as helpful as ever. Location, close to termini station which leads you to metros to different places. Close to colosseum about 10 min walk or 2 mins via train station to the met. Italy itself, beautiful, if you get lost like we did.. we ended up seeing the spanish steps, and several churches we would never have seen on the map! Reccomended to get a roma pass! We only got a day one.. but we got free bus, metro and tram pass for 24 hours for 4 euros - Without this pass its 1 euro per journey. Use this to get to the vatican, spagna (spanish steps) e.t.c all clearly signposted under the city names to tourist attractions.

The TV was also too complicated for me, but I\u2019m technically challenged! My only real complaint, which others have mentioned, was the location. It is definitely a bit out there. The length of the walk itself was not the problem. It is only ten or fifteen minutes from Termini and I did it with little problem carrying two bags. But as a 22-year-old woman traveling alone I felt slightly uncomfortable walking there with my bags. I got hassled a few times, nothing big just a few comments. I\u2019m glad I arrived in Rome in the afternoon and not at night. That being said though, I never felt unsafe in the area and once I dropped my bags off at the hotel I felt the walk was fine. It is a bit out of the way of most of the major attractions though. This wasn\u2019t really an issue for me since I was just staying the night before catching an early morning flight, but I can see how it might be a bit frustrating for someone hoping to explore the major sights of Rome.

It should be pointed out that the hotel is the last one in a row of hotels at the end of via Giolitti, the street which you come out to from the Termini train&metro station. I must say that after a day of walk, it has been very hard to walk through the whole street when all your muscles are sore. During our stay we still didn't find a bus which leads to a closer spot than the Termini station and if we go to Rome again, we will surely look for a hotel which is closer than this one. This is why I wrote that I wouldn't recommend this hotel to a friend..but the reality is always far from being ideal, so you shouldn't rule it out completely. In addition, if you want to go anywhere to eat at night, there's a decent and cheap pizzeria in via Giolitti, whereas all the other places are quite expenssive. Anyhow, if you wish to spend the night in the center, you should look at the buses and metro's time schedule, so that you won't have to walk all the way home and exhaust yourself. About the room: Our room was clean and fully equipped: It had two beds, which were placed one next to the other (not so comfortable when you want to sleep with your partner..), a small fridge, closet, tv (useless since all the programs were in Italian), and of course shower and toilet. The towels resembled table cloth more than ordinary towels, but you can manage. The hotel provides you with soap, shampoo and shower cap so you don't have to bring them from home. another important plus side of the room is that it also had strong air conditioning, which is a must in August's dreadful heat. About breakfast: breakfast was tasty, though very minimal: different kinds of bread, jams, cereal, croissants, juice, milk and coffee. It's a buffet so you can eat as much as you want and it won't keep you hungry. The staff: Since our flight was at midnight and the check out time was 10:30 in the morning, we asked to extend our stay till night. We were charged extra 50 Euros for late departure (leaving at 19:00 instead of 10:30). We think the cost was quite exaggerated and they might have made up this \"standard\" price just to get more of money out of us. If you go there, make sure you don't want to extend your stay as we did, and if you do, settle a good price in advance, either there or at one of the other hotels nearby. Other than that the staff was nice and quite helpful. You should also know that they give you a map of Rome on your arrival, so you don't need to get one on your own. btw: When you get to Rome we recommend you buy a 3 day ticket at the Termini metro station, which will cover 3 whole days of traveling (it costs you 11 euros and you can go anywhere anytime by metros, buses and tram). Naturally you can buy a ticket for longer and shorter time. That would be all.

It cost us just over \u00a3100 each including flights and Bed and Breakfast for the 2 mornings. We flew with Ryan Air from Luton and and all was spot on. We landed at Rome Campino airport and transfered via terravision to the Termini in Central Rome. This transfer was seemless and no problem at all - it was good value at approx \u00a38 each return (this was booked via the Ryan Air web site). Once off the coach drop off point walk straight through the station and out the other side - there are plenty of official taxis there as well as a few unofficial one's that i would stay away from. From my personal experience i would stay away from the underground and get a taxi to the hotel (Approx 8 - 10 euros) although it is only a 10 minute walk but it can be hard with luggage! The hotel is in a pretty shoddy area (but i found all of the outskirts of Rome to be very dirty and plastered in Graffiti everywhere) - but we walked around both days and nights and did not have any problems at all. The hotel staff are fantastic - as soon as we arrived (12 Noon) our room was ready and the gent on reception gave us maps and spoke to us about transport etc. The hotel is very small and the guys on reception also double as bar staff and breakfast helpers. Our room was on the first floor and it was totally fine - fresh towels and toiletries every day. The room was fine space wise and the bathroom and shower were spot on. If you turn left out of the hotel and walk approx 5 mins then take the first main left turn and there are 3 restuarants that serve great pizza's and Pasta - 2 of them are owned by the same guy and he is a comedian to say the least - but he does provide free puddings / ice creams to try!! We booked a city \"hop on hop off tour\" with viator.com (Rome Open tours) - this was great value at \u00a312 each for 2 days. The bus goes all over the city and you can get off and on at any of the 15 stops. The bus departs from the Termini which is a 10 mintue walk left from the hotel. As for Rome itself - is is well worth going, we visited the Vatican Museum (14 euro's each) - but get there for 9am to avoid the queue's - it is wort going just to see the Sistine chapel - but be aware if you try to take any pictures you will be told to stop!! even without the flash on - me and my girlfriend did this a few times and we were warned by 3 different security guards!! When you get to St Peters be aware that the museum is another 5/10 mins walk from there - through the pillars and follow the rather average signs. St Peter's is well worth seeing and the size of the place is simply amazing. We also visited the Colosseum / Pantheon / Trevi Fountain (beware of the rose sellers and \"proffesional\" photographers.) One of the funniest things is seeing the \"Bag\" men doing runners when the police are about on the approach road to St Peters - it is like a bit of \"Cat and Mouse\". We used the public bus to get to the Vatican Early before the tour bus started and that is very easy to use - turn right out of the hotel to the square - buy a 1 euro pass (valid for 75 mins from purchase) there are many bus and tram stops in the square - just make sure you get on the right one!! Ask at the hotel for bus numbers etc - as with all public transport keep your valuables safely inside you clothing - we were warned to be careful as there are loads of pickpockets on the trams/buses. Rome has a fantastic city centre and the culture / history of the builidings is truly amazing. At the hotel the breakfast is a purely continenal affair with just juices / bread etc - so dont be expecting a British Fry up!

You can buy tickets for the coach which will take you to the Termini on your flight, which is a short taxi ride ( which should cost you around 10 - 15 Euro ). The staff are very accomodating, and will go out of their way to get you what you require, even to the extent of finding you a nice restaurant to eat in. Take a trip on the various coaches to see the sites, you can hop on and off as and when you please. The rooms are a bit basic and do not have coffee/tea facilities, but are very comfortable. You will not spend much time in your room as there is far to much to see. If you want to be blessed when you go, make sure you visit Rome Baptist Church, which is English-speaking, you will be more than welcomed by Pastor Dave and his wife. Do visit Bobo's restaurant, which is a 2 minute walk from the hotel, you will not be disappointed at the food which is on offer by Claudia and her staff. The breakfast is a buffet style continental one with hot and cold croissants, cereal, bread rolls, tea, coffee and juices. If you so wish you can have sausage and egg at a cost, we did not bother because the free breakfast was plenty. We went for a short break of 4 days and will go again. Please note that if you book your break separately, i.e. flights online and hotel direct, you will save quite a sum of money. We hope you have found this review of some help, we pray that you have a great time whilst you stay at this hotel.

I was really glad that we had read the various reviews on this web-site before travelling, as they prepared us for the surroundings etc. Yes, the hotel is in a very dirty, grubby, graffiti ridden part of Rome however the warm welcome (in English) by the proprietor and his helpfullness well outweighed the surrounding neighbourhood. The location around the corner from tram line and buses is very handy - we caught the bus from there direct to the Colosseo and walked to St John Lateran, a truly beautiful church. The hotel room was comfortable and the ensuite although small, clean with very hot showers. I must admit it was the first time I'd come across linen towels, which don't seem as nice as the usual towelling towels. The heating via the air conditioner was turned on when we requested (but switched off when we were out). We flew into Leonardo di Vinci and got the airport express train into Termini for 11 euro each. This took about 30 mns and came into platform 24 on the same level right near the main entrance to the station. Taxi from there to the hotel was about 8 euro. During winter one thing to note is that the Sistine Chapel is closed from 12.30pm each arvo, a major dissapointment for us as we arrived there about half an hour after this as it had taken us a couple of hours to climb to the top of St. Peters and view the main church.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cProblems at Principe Di Piemonte\u201d", "Author": "sonalim", "ReviewID": "UR5015914", "Content": "The receptionist who sometimes worked the night shift and sometimes the morning shift (short man in his mid-50's, slick hair with glasses) was extremely fresh and wanted to accompany me to my room!!

The hotel is on the same street as the termini (Via Giovanni Giolitti)so turn left out of the termini and head almost down to the bottom towards Porta Maggiore.

We caught a bus from Ciampino airport to the termini for 10 euros return (we didn't book it in advance, but you can if you want) although it doesn't run all night. The hotel doesn't look much from the outside (Rome is just like any other big city, nice in parts, scruffy in others, but everywhere is covered in graffiti)but the staff are great and speak good English. The rooms are compact but very clean and ours had a lovely hot powerful shower. The area the hotel was in seemed OK and we certainly didn't experience any problems. Breakfast is basic - croissants, rolls, coffee and juice - but for the price we paid, it suited us just fine. Take the 571 bus from literally around the corner which goes past all the major tourist sites including the colosseum, to the Vatican on the other side of the city.

We flew Ryanair to Campiani and the got the Shuttle bus to the main Termini train/bus station in Rome. On the subject of Campiani depnding on the wind direction the pilot may have to take a *very* hard left on his final approach to line up with the runway and then a right to line up again. It's like a rollercoaster ride but good fun all the same. Anyway, meanwhile back at the ranch. Not a bad hotel, you come out of the Termini and take a left and it's down the road about 20 mins walk. However, the location of the hotel could be better which is a pity as the Hotel itself is fine. Lets just say that if you are a walker and you walk to the sites of Rome then to get to the hotel you will have to pass through some of the more dodgier streets in Rome, filled with graffiti and dodgy 2 star 'hotels' and with no offence meant at all, where all the non Italians live. Enough of the location, what about the hotel....a small 20 or so roomed hotel near the train station. The rooms where clean and tidy, we where on the first floor and our room which was at the back of the hotel had a small terrace looking out onto the back of Romes residents blocks but nice all the same. I had a lot of fun playing with a couple of the cats that used to come and soak up the heat on the terrace. However, Rome is famous for traffic noise and on the first night I did not get much sleep due to noise from cars and trams but got used to it. Staff very friendly. You will not get lost in this hotel, as I say nice and small. The breakfast was continental and was served from 7am to a no good for lie in 9.30 am and was cerial, crossiants, bread rolls, jams, tea, coffee and juice etc. Would have liked to have seen some cold ham and cheese or maybe bacon but ate extra crossiants to make up. However, there is no restaurant in Hotel at night for meal but staff willing to recommend a nice restuarant. There is a tv in rooms but no English speaking stations at all. Being from Ireland was expecting Sky News at least. In the Hotel Lobby there was a TV area with Sattellite TV so got English stations there. We watched in first night but amazingly second night the sat box had dissappeared! A pity but the next night they had it replaced with another sat box and could get BBC news. The hotel offers amazing value for their prices for in house drinks. A 330ml bottle of beer could be got for around 1.50 Euro. Being Irish and liking a tipple we found ourselves 'stocking up' in the hotel reception before hitting the town. Although in baddish location it only about 15 mins walk away from Santa Maria Maggiore the famous cathedral. Sure once you are there everywhere else is about 15 mins walk away, go in front of the big catherdral beside the steps and walk straight up the road about in about another 15 mins you'll be at the Spanish Steps and then the party really starts. One thing to watch - not a Hotel problem but a Rome problem. As it was not in the best area we found ourselves using taxis alot. You need to realise that you are charged from the moment a driver accepts your job. So he could be 10 minutres drive away and you pay for that, even though you are not in the cab. The hotel told us this after we questiosn why taxi fares ranged from 9 Euro to 15 euro to the same location, Santa Maria Maggiore. Overall I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel, very clean and modern, marble every where, elegant, staff very friendly, on arrival the very friendly behind reception supplied us with maps etc and told us major bus routes. Drink very good value. Breakfast enough to get you going. Location could be better but we did feel safe, you'll not get mugged but area could be more visually appealing. If you are a walker or don't mind getting taxi's then I would not think twice about recommending the hotel for staying in. Was 3 star and deserved it. Enjoyed our stay, had stayed in Rome in Sept 2003 in the Hotel Universo which was about 15 mins up the road and which was a 4 star and did not deserve it but ok all the same.", "Date": "October 16, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Principe Di Piemonte", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d232837-Reviews-Hotel_Principe_Di_Piemonte-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$93 - $262*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Giovanni Giolitti 449</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232837", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f2/2e/f22eb88fb2bb6eb1f249189091bf12f33large.jpg"}}
