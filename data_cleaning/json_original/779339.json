Despite this is not a hotel that caters for children the staff were very attentative and made our stay as confortable as possible. For example, they went out of their way to find us a babysitter in a very short notice (a few hrs!). The hotel is tastefully decorated and architecturally truly impressive. The food was also of the highest standards. Innovative cuisine but what surprised us was the large quantity. We both had steak with foie and we almost could not finish the plates! The only unfortunate thing about the hotel is that it is located in a residential area.. nothing wrong with the area (on the contrary, quite beautiful houses around) but it would have ideal to have such an impressive hotel located in the middle of the countryside or with views to the sea.. However, we were really amazed by the extremely high quality price ratio. It is really worth the stay !!!", "Date": "Mar 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR767833042", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "barcelon1"}, {"Content": "Nos encant\u8d38   showReview(12611803, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR391498274", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "unaMallorcq"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d779339-r21519089-Mas_Albereda-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "779339", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
