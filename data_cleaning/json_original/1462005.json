There was a large contingent of people from the race staying at the hotel, as it was close to the finish line. My experience was decidedly mixed. There is no escaping the fact that this is a dreadfully hip establishment, and I'm fairly certain that I'm not hip enough for it. When I arrived at 6pm it was already getting challenging to navigate the lobby, due to the mood lighting and the DJ. By the time I returned from dinner at 10pm the lobby was so darned cool that I could barely find the elevators in the dark. More hip music selections in the (pink lava-lamp themed) elevators, and you'll surely want to buy the cool CD of W music that's available in your room. The rooms are full of more hip and cool stuff. Looking like it was designed by folks who fancy themselves as minor league Jonny Ive types. Few opportunities are missed to do something in an out of the ordinary way. Like, even the toilet flush was unusual. You might really like this, you might not. I found it cute, but not a reason to choose to stay there. There are plenty of things that are good about the hotel. First, the beds. The mattress was a little on the soft side for my taste, but the bedding was heavenly. I so wish I didn't have to get up at 4am for my race. And the shower is outstanding -- very, very well received after the race. My room was on the 17th floor on the north side, where it directly overlooks the 9/11 Memorial and growing Freedom Tower. Amazing view. This might not persist, as there's another building under construction between W and the WTC. The coffee in the lobby in the morning is rather good. The rooms don't feel too tiny by NYC standards (I had one with 2 doubles). Then the not so good. First, $17/day for wifi is a joke. We know it costs them very little to run it (that's why the less pricey hotels don't charge you for it). Second, it feels like the room is more of a product placement experience than a place to stay and rest. And that relates to my main complaint, which is a bit of a rant about the difficulty of getting a morning coffee (... given how much I had paid for the room). Most normal places have in room coffee. But there's no space for that at W, given the amount of real estate that's needed for product placements. But there's a little note hidden in an alcove that says that you can request a coffee maker if you'd like one. Great! I really could use that for the 4am start. I ask the concierge: \"Sure, no problem\". By the time I get back to my room she's on the phone saying that they were fresh out of them. But that's no problem, as they say that you can get it in the lobby any time in the morning. \"I have to be up at 4am, which is on the early side for that kind of thing.\" \"No problem.\" [... too few hours of sleep in the wonderful bed ...]. At 4:15 when I go to the lobby, the new concierge looks at me like I'm nuts when I ask about coffee. He seems kind of annoyed to see somebody at that time of the night. I know this isn't a huge deal, but it just seemed symptomatic of where this hotel's priorities are. Being a hipster shouldn't mean that you can forget the basics. I was foolish enough to bring my car with me to New York. Fortunately, the Icon garage around the corner from the W has a $35/day rate for W guests, which is not bad for NYC prices, and much better than their regular $62/day rate.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cModern hotel- great staff\u201d", "Author": "karistiz", "ReviewID": "UR126250161", "Content": "I stayed here with some girl friends as a mini reunion.

Loads to see downtown but at night things are a bit quieter, you are not barging past crowds to get from A-Z like you are around Times Square. I stayed for 3 nights in a twin, double room. Best bits, the beds are sooooo comfy to sleep in, crisp, white linen, super soft pillows and lots of them. The room was a really good size, the best size I've experienced in a NY hotel ; so rare. The shower was amazing, powerful and easy to operate/find the right temperature. Bathroom came with decent toiletries inc bath robe and a powerful hair dryer (ladies you can leave yours behind at home)! The room had all the mod cons: plasma TV mounted on the wall, DAB radio come iPod dock, air con, in room mini bar. There was ample storage and wardrobe space for a short stay. The view from the bedroom window was fab, you walk in and are instantly drawn to the big windows, lots of light floods in. I had an amazing view of the financial district's skyscrapers and the Ground Zero memorial site. Seeing it from 17 floors up was very impressive. So what else about this hotel? It is \u00fcber trendy in its design, you could be forgiven for thinking you'd walked in to an upmarket bar rather than a hotel. It is clealry trying to appeal to the hip young, clubbing, crowd. Just to the side of reception you\u2019ll see some DJ decks for the evenings ambience. Despite this, I never heard the music or the crowd from my room. The scene may or may not be your thing but it's not intimidating. I don\u2019t consider myself trendy nor does my old man, who travelled with me, but he was fine with it all, if not slightly bemused. All staff I met were friendly and more than happy to help. Check in was quick and easy, within moments I had key card in hand and was catching the lift to my room. The hotel was quiet, no noisy neighbours, my room was directly opposite the lift and I didn't hear a peep. The hotel includes a couple of bars/restaurants - the one bar has a balcony on three sides which might be nice on a warm evening. There is also a gym - I didn't get chance to explore these options but its there if you need it. Every morning they put out free coffee and tea which you can help yourself to - nice little touch before you head out for a day of fun in the city. For me this particular visit was about comfort. Knowing I wouldn't be in my room much but would be totally exhausted when I was, I wanted comfort and quiet so I could get a good kip in. The comfort of the bed, the space to move around the room easily without tripping over suitcases and each other is why this hotel worked for me. As for rate, well I believe I had a steal. Booked last minute-ish via Expedia and paid \u00a3350 for 3 nights for two adults, sharing a twin, room only. The acid test...would I return...Yes, Yes and Yes. I can't wait until I have another reason to return to new York/W Hotel.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bermuda", "Title": "\u201c5th SPG property in the City\u201d", "Author": "imari96", "ReviewID": "UR126063696", "Content": "I stayed downtown this trip as a result of having a meeting in the area.

Like many other W's, there was alot of snacks and other items taking up space on the desk. Speaking of the desk, it was slightly small for my business needs. I'm sure a larger room wouldn't have this issue. I absolutely loved the window seat they had. I sat there while preparing for a meeting instead of the desk. Bed was of course, very comfortable. I agree with another reviewer who said it would have been nice to have towel hooks. The counter space was also small. Shower was great though. I used the gym once and preferred the gym at The Westin, mainly for the equipment and space. However, the gym was still good and really my only complaint is having to walk through the lobby to get to the second set of elevators to use the gym.

First of all I a, not a fan of the financial district. It is a soulless part of an otherwise vibrant city. In future I would opt for a hotel in Soho, the Village, or possibly closer to Union Square. Second of all, I personally feel that the W chain takes itself too seriously and often feel that the modernity comes at a cost of some basic practicalities and creature comforts. The room was marvelous but the bathroom lacked some basic fixtures for hanging up wet towels for example. The darkness in the lobby and bar areas seem cool at first but when black greets you in every room even at 9am it becomes a little tired very quickly. The most irritating aspect of the stay was the so-called complimentary Accura car service. Upon check-in you are told that there's is one free complimentary drop off in the city with the hotel's Accura fleet for each day of your stay. We tried to book this on three separate occasions without success. We also witnessed other guests being told that the service was unavailable.

There are a few people at the hotel who really made the experience magical. Robert at the door is truly incredible. He always greeted us with a smile, and he was always helpful with pointing us in the right direction on how to get around in the area. The Acura driver, I believe his name was Nader? was a true pleasure to be around. He showed us some amazing sites while we drove to our destination, and he even played the music station that we liked on the radio. Please tell him that we did try the pizza that he recommended, and it was incredible. Finally, the front desk staff at this hotel is truly top notch. Please forgive me if I mispell their names, but Jevon and Yahayra are truly a fun duo to be around. You can really tell that they enjoy working together and they are EXTREMELY funny. It was fun to share stories with Jevon about The Netherlands, and we even liked the same beer from there lol. Both Jevon and Yahayra always greeted us with a smile and were always able to answer any questions that we had for them. They even upgraded us to a suite since it was our anniversary and gave us free drinks at the bar. The view of the site was truly breath taking, and it really gave us a chance to take in the history that we were experiencing. It is because of them, that my wife will never forget this trip that we had. The room was excellent and it smelled amazing. I am still trying to figure out what it is that they spray the rooms with, as I want to get that for my own house. The drinks at the bar are strong, which is a plus, and the hotel is conveniently located next to all the major subway lines in the city so getting around was not a problem for us.

The concierge was terrible at fulfilling simple requests (ex. on two occasions, I asked for a bowl to be sent up to the room in the morning only to realize that it was never going to come) and miscommunication by the staff was not handled professionally at all (ex. I was told that I could have the front desk print a document for me and that I should bring it down on a flash drive, but upon arriving at the front desk, the rude clerk told me they can't extract information from flash drives at the front desk and that I needed to email it to her.

I also received a copy of the reservation where there was indeed a note that I would arrive at midnight.

That's right, the room that I had paid for upfront had been given away and now they were going to \"walk\" me to another hotel. What they really meant by \"walk\" me was to put me in a cab to New Jersey, yep that's right they had the cab drive me to another hotel in another state.

For 2 days and 3 calls to the \"Whatever whenever\" front desk we finally got our \"let's make this better package\" - a bottle of water and a plate with 1 orange, 1 apple, 1 banana, 1 kiwi fruit.

It directly overlooks the World Trade Center building site and memorial. The 5th floor lobby includes an observation deck that doubles as an outdoor lounge, offering World Trade Center views unlike any others in the city. If you get a room on a high, north-facing floor, you'll get that, as well as million dollar views of the entire city. While I managed to get an upgraded, corner room, my view wasn't great, but the room itself was fantastic. Decor is very modern - almost Jetsons modern - with stark white walls and white furniture contrasting with chocolate brown carpeting and bathroom tile. The corner room included an L-shaped padded window seat that was a nice bonus for taking in the views. The pros for this hotel: 1. Easily accessible by subway. Take the A Train from the Howard Beach station to the Fulton street exit. The hotel is about 4 blocks away. To get pretty much anywhere uptown, take the 1 train at the Rector street station around the corner. There are several subway stations in the area, but this one is closest. 2. Swanky lobby with cool bar, observation deck and evening DJ. Order drinks, order food, see and be seen. 3. Comfortable room with great bedding. Bathroom has a big shower with dark tile that almost looks like brown leather. Try to get on a high floor. Even if you don't face uptown, the views can be excellent, regardless. 4. If you're visiting the 9-11 Memorial, the entrance is literally across the street. Be sure to reserve your entry time in advance. The cons: 1. The only downside to the room was that I thought the bathroom lighting was kind of dim. 2. Now that the 9-11 Memorial is open, there are a LOT of people in this part of town. The Wall Street area used to be very quiet on the weekends because there isn't a ton of tourist stuff to see. That's changed. 3. Construction noise is constant during the day, including Saturday. The hotel is so close to the WTC site, you hear it all. However, they stop at night, so sleeping isn't an issue. But don't plan on a peaceful afternoon nap. 4. There aren't very many good dining or shopping options in this part of town. But it's so easy to get to all of the great neighborhoods by subway, that didn't really matter to me. Subway is definitely quicker than a cab through the narrow, clogged streets in this area. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It's a very different experience than you would get versus staying in the Times Square area, which is so tourist focused. I'd prefer to be away from all of that unless going to a show or dinner. Aside from the WTC, you're also closer to the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge and not too far from SoHo. The hotel can also offer some pretty good rates during non-peak times.

I really don't know how to explain our experience. We arrived late because we were driving from the Boston area. When we arrived, we were greeted cordially by a doorman and escorted to the lobby on the 5th floor. When we arrived on the 5th floor, there was an incredible blast of music! The music was somewhere between disco and rap. My husband and I owned a discotheque for six years, so we were not too shocked. What were disconcerting were the lights on the curved ceiling that reflected off the floor. The experience was not good. We had to navigate to the next set of elevators. The optical Illusion was not comfortable; we felt like we were drunk. At first, we thought since we're older than the target demographic, we couldn't make a fair evaluation. However, after talking with young people (late twenties to forties), they felt the same way. They told us that they were upset and disoriented by the lights, music, and layout of the hotel. Our room 2211 was clean but extremely small. The bed was very comfortable and probably the best part of our stay. The bathroom had very little space. There was nowhere to put a toothbrush or any cosmetics. Maybe, this would be a great room for a single business person. If you would like to see how you look before proceeding to a meeting, you would wonder, where is the mirror? It's on the backside of the closet door. If you open the closet door, lean against the other door, and you're really thin you might be able to see yourself. We stayed at the W in Boston, and it was one of the best experiences in our lives. The \"W\" NYC Downtown needs to take a look at what other \"W\" hotels do. Our children live in NYC, and we visit often. This was our first stay at the W Downtown NYC. We won't be back. The location was bad; the streets and sidewalks were blocked off due to construction. We couldn't even take a walk. We were trapped like rats in a maze. Our advice to the \"W\" Downtown is to: 1. Expand your target demographic and redesign the lobby and guest rooms to meet the needs of a more diverse clientele. All guests whether they are 20 or 60 want a quiet, clean, comfortable place to relax. I believe all travelers, business people, and tourists want the same thing. 2. Put a shelf in the bathroom so guests can store their toiletries. 3. Install a full-length mirror on the outside of the closet door. 4. Repaint in the guestrooms and hallways\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis would freshen up and brighten up these areas. 5. Work out a plan with the cab companies to actually come down the street for customers. Your doorman told us to just go take the subway! 6. Visit some great hotels in the area like the Andaz and Gild Hall to pick up some pointers. 7. Rearrange the elevator configuration. Going up five floors to the lobby is not a good plan. Guests should not have to wangle their way from the check-in desk, go across the dance floor, and walk in front of the DJ to get to the next bank of elevators which will eventually take them to their rooms. 8. Tone down the elevator music. Find music that is appealing to all. 9. Supply the correct email address when sending out a survey. GMWolfgang.Wehen@whotels.com is not a valid email address. The email gets returned. Remove the GM\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe called to get the correct address. Unfortunately, you cannot change your location!

How unfortunate that we stayed at The Ritz first! What an poor contrast for the W. My review for the W is as follows: The lobby is kitschy and attractive, but with a strong dose of citrusy potpourri that I didn't care for. The hallways have a most unpleasant dirty carpet smell that they try to cover up with air freshener, and are dark and dingy. The whole hotel had a humid feeling that wasn't appealing. Our $3,000.00 per night \"extreme wow suite\" looked nothing like the photos on line. I realize that there are different suites, but the decor in ours was pretty dated. It was muggy and stuffy when we opened the door. The tub was clean, but there was dirt in the grout around the tub and shower in the bathroom. Not what you expect to see for that kind of money. Also, it is very small. They told us when we booked that the room would sleep 6 people. There is ONE queen-sized bed, ONE bathroom, and a small living room with stained, not-so-fresh smelling furniture. They brought in 3 roll-away beds for us with fresh, clean sheets, but they had lumpy mattresses, and because fire safety laws limit the rollaways to 3, one person had to sleep on that couch. The patio is large and beautiful, but the cushions on the outdoor furniture were sun-faded and grimy, and one of the planters smelled as though the last guests urinated in it. There is very dim lighting out there, also. If there were another bathroom, it would be a fine place to have a party, with the large balcony, and great sound system, but then your guests would have to leave because there is no place for them to sleep. About the amenities:They knew they had 6 guests coming, and there was ONE 2 inch bar of nice smelling soap, and one each of some sample toiletries. Come on, not even a separate dinky bar of soap for the sink, shower and tub? One roll of toilet paper on the spindle and another far away in the hall closet. Two wine glasses, and a few champagne flutes with fingerprints on them. One of the wine glasses had lipstick on it. They gave us a bowl of beautiful green apples in the living area, and the one I took off the top was delicious. The ones on the bottom had brown rotten spots with mold in the centers on the underside, leading me to believe that the service staff replaces only the apples on top between guests, leaving the bottom ones until they ferment. A word about how that \"whatever, whenever\" slogan : Baloney. The concierge never answered the phone him or herself the whole time we were there. You are expected to leave a message. I decided against room service after seeing the moldy apples, and went down to the continental breakfast at the bar area. I found the domes that contained the baked goods smeared with fingerprints, so I chose a yogurt. I asked for honey to top it, and was told they had it, but then they couldn't find it. The clerk sighed, and said she COULD run downstairs and get it, IF I wanted to wait. I did not, seeing as how it took 10 minutes to purchase a cup of yogurt. I found some of the staff friendly, but some sullen, as though they were tired of listening to the complaints of their customers. Friendly or not, the service is quite slow. All in all, I thought this hotel seemed to be a dated partiers crash-pad type of place, and not at all what I expected for the money.

The hotel is in a good location. Is is right beside the WTC area. The hotel terrace overlooks current construction going on at Ground Zero. This may be a plus or minus, depending on how you look at it. We thought it was really neat to see this in progress and the construction noise didn't bother us, although you could definitely hear it all through the night (just didn't bother us). After all WTC construction is complete, the view will be amazing. The hotel sits just south, so rooms on the north side would give the best views of WTC. The hotel is right around the corner from the Rector St. train (lines 1 & R). It's easy to get around the financial district on foot and midtown Manhattan is very accessible via the Rector St. trains. The area seemed very safe and there were plenty of small restaurants nearby. There are delis and cafes and pizza places unique to NYC and a Burger King, Starbucks and Subway all just a short walk from the hotel. If you are visiting The Statue of Liberty from Battery Park, the ferry station is also a very short walk from the hotel. It would probably take longer to take the train. The hotel's BLT Grill has very good food but it's very expensive. We ate there one night and our bill for two ran about $140. The food was VERY GOOD. The service was not great. The waiters were friendly enough, just seemed to be overworked/busy and our food took forever, glasses were not filled, I received a white wine when I ordered a red, etc. The hotel's interior is very artsy in a youthful contemporary way. A lot of attention to detail is given. When you enter the elevator, the floor mat will say GOOD MORNING in the morning, GOOD AFTERNOON in the afternoon and GOOD EVENING at night. The rooms also looked as if they were designed by an art student. I was pleased with the look and everything was very clean. The room was EXTREMELY small. That was fine with us. There were two of us and with a king size bed, we had just enough walking space for luggage. Speaking of the bed, it was VERY COMFORTABLE. It was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever experienced! I liked the down pillows and comforter. There were marks on the wall as I've seen in several reviews. The hotel is very new and it did look older than it is. I have 2 small kids and have lived where I do 10 years and my walls are less marred. So, they probably should give the rooms a new paint job. There were two things that bothered me about the room. One was, the bathroom door (which was a sliding door) required TWO PEOPLE to close it and it was only with great effort at that. Another issue I had was that there is a red light which stays on in the closet. It looks really cool when you open it HOWEVER, at night, when your lights are off, you can see a little light coming out of the closet. That was a little annoying/distracting. Other than that, it was nice and comfortable and seemed safe, just not as new looking as it should look and small. By the way, the bathroom was a decent size, it was only the bedroom that was micro. One more thing I'll add... You can get internet access for your room for about $15/night. We wanted that but didn't realize, it was not $15 for the whole hotel room but for every single device we had on the internet.

The bed was comfy, the view from my room was fantastic. I only had 4 issues, (1) the bathroom lighting was not the best when I went to put on my makeup; after my stay, I did notify the hotel of the bathroom issue. They are aware that the lighting is not that great and said they would look at how to make things better for the femal guests (2) my safe was not working so make sure your safe is working or ask for another room; (3) my last issue was the Friday night really late, a couple of the guests were really loud from their room so it was hard to get any sleep that one night; (4), I went to use their internet system to log onto my computer, I had trouble getting to my email account to check my flight information and no matter what I did I could not get to the website and I still got charged for it. Very frustrating so don't use their internet service unless you absolutely have to. The staff was friendly and always had a smile on their face, very helpful.

Wall Street isn't trendy, so this sticks out and brings a breath of fresh air. Having BLT is great. Not having a Bliss is not, but there are Bliss products in the rooms. The hotel suffers from having 1/2 its rooms facing the World Trade Center site and the hole occupying the site of the Deutsche Bank building, which finally came down earlier this year. The hotel does have blackout shades if you are on that side, so you aren't bothered by the 24/7 (no kidding, they work those hours for real) work on the Trade Center site. When the construction is done, these rooms will be fantastic. The rooms here are palaces compared with those at the W Leicester Square, which shows the difference in customer service and attitude. Hotel rooms in both London and NYC are small, but there is a huge difference. There is also a difference in the attitude of the staff. Here they are warm and helpful. They aren't top-notch or as accommodating as at other Ws, but they are better than average and than at the W in London. Great beds, as usual. I was surprised that BLT, which is great, doesn't provide room service and that you have to go down to get it as \"carry out.\" I was surprised my request to have the lightbulb replaced in the make-up mirror didn't happen.

Had previously visited the bar and decided it would be nice to stay here since it's in a good area and the price was pretty reasonable for New York. The hotel is very flashy which I expected, with a nice, upscale bar that overlooks the Ground Zero construction site. I can only imagine that once the construction is completed the price on the rooms at this hotel is going to skyrocket. With that said, the first thing I noticed when we arrived early in the morning on Friday was that the construction at Ground Zero was very loud, and could easily be heard in the room when the air conditioning wasn't off. Thankfully the construction ceased on Friday evening until we left on Sunday, but I would definitely reconsider staying here if you have trouble falling asleep to the sound of constant jackhammers. I originally tried to move to a room on the opposite side of the hotel but was told they could not accommodate the request because there was no availability. The hotel restaurant is very pricey (spent about $30 on an appetizer and a beer for lunch), and the bar is expensive as well (think $17 martinis) but it's a cool vibe and a nice place to hang out with friends at a modern, cutting edge location. The room was a bit on the smaller side for the price (though maybe not for New York) at about 350 square feet. I was surprised to find that for a brand new hotel, there were a TON of markings all over the wall, as if they had somehow been scuffed during construction and were never cleaned up. My only other qualm I have with the hotel is that, while the service was generally good, it wasn't exactly the type of deferential treatment you expect when paying for a hotel of this price. For example, one day I called down to reception to request turndown service, to which the front desk person responded in an obnoxious, quizitive tone, \"turndown?\", as if she had never heard of it before. Clearly she had because she went on to inform me that they could only do turndown after 5, and that I had just checked in. I had to explain to her that I had people coming over and wanted the room to be clean. Not that big a deal, but at any other high end hotel, this would not have been such a long conversation. Another issue I had was on one of the nights I had a few people in my room and apparently someone called management on us for being too loud. A manager came by and told us to quiet down, which is fine and totally understandable, except that she rebuked us for having been told to quiet down 3 times.

This is an acceptable hotel (though not a credit to the W brand), but I would be unlikely to return to this property. The front desk staff was enthusiastic and helpful at check-in, and once someone arrived at the front desk, he was very efficient at check-out, as well. We were generally greeted by the doormen at the hotel entrance. The fifth-floor lobby of the hotel is a cool appealing and whimsical design, though fairly dark. The shower was the best I have had in a W hotel (combining aspects of the rainfall shower without the anaemic water pressure). Other reviewers have noted noise issues at this hotel, but my room was very quiet. Glimpses of the river could be caught between buildings from the room. These were the high points of our experience at the hotel. Other aspects of the hotel were somewhat disappointing. The room was quite small (even by New York standards), and it should probably have been outfitted with a Queen instead of a King bed. Even with the corner room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s windows (one of which was able to open), it felt very cramped and probably ill-suited for more than one person. The pocket door on the bathroom seemed cheap, but it is unclear whether there would have been clearance for a proper door. Despite having been booked directly through Starwood, this had the feel of the rooms I would get at the Grand Hyatt in New York when I booked through Hotwire/Expedia as a student. At less than one year old, the room in which I stayed was not wearing well. The white walls were scuffed in various places, and there were obvious patches that had been made. There were a couple of drips of water coming out from between the panels underneath the sink. In addition, while the room size is not an issue that can be overcome, I would have expected the room to be slightly cleaner, as there was visible dust in several places when I arrived (including on the mini-bar snack tray items). I was also disappointed that the terrace off of the lobby was closed when I tried to go out in the afternoon and that none of the staff in the area offered any assistance (or even telling us that it was closed) as we tried multiple doors. Finally, this is the first W at which I have stayed where I was overwhelmed by the brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature scent. A friend and I had to literally hold our breath in the elevator from the street level to the lobby at one point. None of these were enough to ruin my stay, but there are certainly better hotels in the area. I expect better of this brand. In this area of Lower Manhattan, I have previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton Battery Park and the Millennium Hilton, and I would recommend the former if you can get a decent rate (it is a couple of blocks further south, but its rooms are quite large with harbour views and telescopes for looking at the Statue of Liberty). I am not normally a huge fan of staying off the island when visiting New York, but given the proximity and convenience of the PATH station (both to the World Trade Centre and the hotel in New Jersey), SPG members needing to be in Lower Manhattan should seriously consider the excellent W Hoboken. The hotel is located across the street from the site of the World Trade Centre. Once the pavilion opens, it will be easier to get around this area (including to the PATH station on the other side). There seemed to be a shortage of taxis on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s street, but they can be more easily found a couple of blocks to the east.

The Union Square location required too many points for all the rooms we needed. I thought the location would be too far removed from everything but we ended up loving the location. Quick walk to Tribeca restaurants and we never had a problem getting taxis either. There is so much to do downtown, I never go to midtown anymore. If you have things you need to do in mid or uptown this may not be a good choice. Walked along the Hudson in the morning- just beautiful. Bad part of the location is the sound of construction- it was loud by 8am. The hotel itself is super modern, maybe too modern. We liked the lobby bar for happy hour and the terrace was great. Great spot for a pre-dinner cocktails, esp on Friday. On Saturday they had the elevator and terrace music blasting first thing in the morning. I think it was set at the level from Friday night and no one bothered to turn it down. They didn't do this on Sunday, so either someone complained or a manager finally picked up on it. We were trying to relax with our coffee on the terrace but we couldnt even hear each other talk it was so loud. I just thought it was strange that a manager would allow it. The rooms were so-so...painted white so it showed tons of scuff marks on the walls. They had a worn look already for such a new hotel. Bathrooms were tiny and seemed to have poor construction. Our room had a funny smell...I should have had our room changed but by the time I realized the smell wasnt going away I didn't feel like packing everything back up, etc. The blackout shades allow light in through the sides...this is a MAJOR design flaw!!! Ive never stayed in a hotel that this happened. At 8am it looked like we had spotlights on in our room! If you are looking to sleep in and relax, stay somewhere else. We faced ground zero so maybe if you stay on the south side the light isn't as bad. Cleanliness wasn't an issue and the bed was extremely comfortable. Service was ok, on par with other W's. I feel as a whole W's used to have amazing service but over the last two years they have been average. I believe rooms start around 200$...that is a steal for nyc.

In addition, the complimentary Acura Experience service offered by the W is great when you don't feel like taking the subway. Our disappointment with this property was the maintenance and the service. The bathroom tiles looked like leather and snakeskin, but the bathroom layout was not very functional. In addition, every towel rack or hanger in the bathroom was loose and wobbly, so that things literally fell off the walls. While most of the staff members were very friendly and professional, there were some very notable exceptions. One of the concierge staff members was rude and acted like her job would be great if she didn't have to deal with pesky hotel guests--what a bother. In addition, our two experiences with the bar were disappointing. The outside bar overlooks Ground Zero, but you have to put up with indifferent service and ridiculously overpriced (and bad) cocktails.

The employee made sure to check me into a room on the side of the building opposite of the construction site where jackhammers start at 6 a.m. The bellman showed me to my room and explained that the hotel was an eco-friendly hotel. One interesting touch: to turn on the lights in the room, you insert your room key into a special device near the room's entrance. Remove the key and your lights go out on a timer. Keep the key in and the lights stay on. As I think about it, every single employee I encountered at this hotel was pleasant and helpful. The concierge helped me get show tickets and recommended a nearby restaurant. (It had opened 4 months earlier and was excellent.)

Later, the next day at breakfast in the hotel's restaurant, I had terrific service from everyone I encountered -- the hostess, the waiter, the busboy.

You take an elevator from the bottom floor to the lobby. To get to your room, you must use a different set to elevators and swipe your room key card. This I like because no one from the outside world could take the elevators for a ride. The lobby had a darker night club feel.

The hotel just opened in late 2010 and has yet to open all floors. Pros: - The hotel is right next to the World Trade Center so it's a great location if you're in NYC for business around the Wall Street area. However, if you're traveling for leisure, it can be quite a pain since it takes at least 15 minutes by subway to get to midtown. The subway is a quick 2-minute walk from the hotel. - The rooms are very spacious for a NYC hotel. The decor is consistent with the W brand and creates a very clean and modern look. I also love the Bliss Spa amenities. - We utilized the Acura car service as much as we could. It's a free service and can take you anywhere in Manhattan up to 90th street. You definitely need to book ahead though since it's a very popular service. I believe the hotel only has 2 cars available. - The employees were helpful and provided quick service. They were all friendly and very knowledgeable about the area. Cons: - The convenient location to Wall Street comes at a price. We arrived around 8:30 pm on a Thursday night and ended up switching rooms since we could easily hear construction of the World Trade Center. The front desk agent said the construction was supposed to end at 8 pm but it continued until about 9 pm. The noise must be very frustrating for business guests who are trying to work in their room. The front desk agent was very accommodating though in switching our rooms but I can see the noise causing a huge issue when the hotel is full with a limited number of rooms away from the construction. - The quality of construction seemed a bit spotty. Our bathroom door would always slide shut and the paint in certain areas of the hallway and lobby was already wearing thin. - If you're a leisure traveler looking for nightlife around the hotel on the weekends, I'd recommend a different location since the area will be dead. The hotel bar was also very empty on a Saturday night. - There is a kiosk in the lobby to check-in to your flight and print your boarding pass. I tried to use the kiosk twice and both times the system timed out. Though it's a great feature, the hotel needs to first make sure the system has no faults. - The TV channels were spotty with no reception on Saturday morning. This may have been a one-time issue since it only occurred then. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the W Hotel though it was a pain to be so far from midtown.

Unfortunately at W-Downtown in our recent stay, sleeping was not an option. Construction noise was running at in excess of 80 decibels inside our guest room. On a number of nights construction noise ran until well after midnight, on the day we were checking out (which incidentally was a Saturday) construction noise began around 7.30am, which I guess was to be expected given that it had started at that time for the remainder of our stay. Half way through our stay I complained about the noise, the staff were courteous and apologetic and offered us another room. A room which would have been far too small, and did not appear to offer additional benefits with the exception of being on the side of the building and not facing Ground Zero. On the second last day of our stay, a voicemail came through at 10.04am (according to the message) to advise us that there would be no hot water in the hotel between 10am through to 4pm. I called Whatever Whenever (the Concierge Desk), to be advised that they did not know when hot water would be back on, and they would contact the company who had the gas off, hardly the pro-active response I would have expected from representatives of a Starwood hotel. Apart from the above, the hotel is new, has very nice and spacious rooms, with the exception of the side room that we were offered as an alternative, and has all the amenities you would expect in a W. I expect that the W Downtown will age fairly quickly given the white interiors, and I noticed in the room we were staying in, dirty black marks which had not been cleaned off, and some of the linen was already showing wear, particularly the towels. As you would appreciate I was extremely disappointed at the above inconveniences during our stay, particularly given that I had made it clear to the Starwood agent who had taken my booking that we would be on vacation, and we stayed in the hotel for 9 nights. My personal opinion is that Starwood either should not have opened this hotel, until the Dueche Bank building has been completely demolished (which the W\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staff told me would not be before at least the end of the year), or should be warning potential guests of the possible inconvenience, something they certainly did not do with me, although the manager on duty when I made further complaints on the day before we left told me he would ensure that happened in the future, something I will believe when I hear it with my own ears! All in all a very disappointing experience, and Starwood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response has been to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gift me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd points which I can redeem for a night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accommodation. It hardly makes up for 9 very sleep disturbed nights, where we paid good money to stay in what should be a lovely hotel. I have stayed in Starwood hotels in at least seven different countries, all of our prior experiences have been positive in their hotels. I have never provided feedback such as this on a website previously. I provide this summary as a warning to potential guests of the W Downtown, so that they can make an informed decision before they commit to staying in this hotel. I should also add that I have passed on this feedback to the General Manager of the hotel in question some two weeks ago, she promised a response within three days, despite two follow up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and two weeks passing no response has been received.

Every single person we met was friendly and solicitous and if they did not know what to do, they did not hesitate to find someone who did. We were made to feel as valued guests. Hip,sleek, shiny, modern and pretty...... as you would expect from a W. The rooms were a good size for NYC standards. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom and shower was great. Linens were top notch and the towels new and plush. Kind of everything you would expect from the words \"W\" and \"new.\" Coffee in the am and apples and water in the lobby was a nice touch. Although you are waayyy downtown, 3 major subway lines are within a block or 2 walk. The hotel has a Acura service that will drive you anywhere in the city for free. Just be prepared for a marketing pitch on the Acura. Not a hard sell though and it was a nice feature. We ate at BLT for dinner and it was outstanding. Still quiet but the food and service was great. Breakfast was just \"ehh.\" Our only complaint involved noise. Understandably, the dismantling of the building across the street is beyond their control. All of lower Manhattan in transforming and building. No one knows what might be built in it's place but the current construction will be short term. We also heard no noise from room to room....a pet peeve of ours. But..........It is a tall and narrow building and almost all rooms on the floors have close proximity to the 3 elevators. The elevators did not create a problem in our room but the doors to the hall do not block the sound of the guests standing waiting for them. No one seems to realize how loud their voices are and how they carry once they are out of their own rooms. As the hotel becomes more occupied, this might be more of an issue. I don't know how they can fix our biggest issue. Late into the night (2-6am), when all external noise has subsided and the air-conditioner is not running, the music from the lobby can be heard through the air ducts. Our first night, we thought the speakers for the outside terrace bar had been left on. The next night, we thought it was a nearby rooftop club? Then we thought it might be from the elevators..... but the sound was coming from further inside the room. It wasn't until 3 nights into it that we figured out what it could possibly be. The Front desk said they have never heard anyone complain about this issue before. Maybe it was our room location or proximity to the lobby (were were on floor 8 and the lobby is on 5) or just the fact that we were up at that time???

The hotel was easy to find. Check in was easy and staff was great at check in. I will talk about all aspects of the hotel we used. Room- Kinda upset. Door was dirty. Scratches and dings all over the flat white walls. Spoke to GM and regrets using flat white paint. Room didn't have towels or hand soap on arrival. Great beds, great tv, cool phones, Apple docking system, descent size for NY. Seen smaller bathrooms. Rain shower was nice, but if your going to put a rain shower in the shower be sure to have multiple shower caps. Girlfriend needed to request. Elevators were cool, although you need to stop on the 5th floor then catch another to get to the ground floor. No way to go from your room to the ground floor. But as you exit at the 5th floor there was always someone to greet us, fresh water and apples were available. In Room Dining was not good. Presentation was cool. Ordered a cheese plate one night and it came with nothing. No breadsticks, crostinis, crackers, etc.. Just a few grapes? Never in my life have I had to pay for crackers or bread with a cheese plate. Location is 2-3 minutes from NYSE, Freedom Hall, Lehman, AIG, Trinity Church, etc. Will be one block from the new Freedom Tower when it's completed. View was not good from 801. Looking directly down at the construction cars and site, trash bins, etc... Reconstruction of the Freedom Tower is very important but the view from that side of the building is currently not to good. Will be great in 3 years when the building is completed. Living Room and Lounge were great and comforable. The Acura Experience was great, use it if you can. Way better then a cab. Staff were pretty good not great. Phone etiquette needs a little work. I know those paying between $400-$800 a night for a standard room don't way to be told to \"hold on\" or \"wait a minute\" wouldn't happen at the Ritz or Four Seaons. Would stay here again, but would definitely like to see a few changes implemented first. There are just to many options in NYC to be mediocre when people pay the rates they do in NYC.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cWait about two years\u201d", "Author": "Ken_SF", "ReviewID": "UR80648871", "Content": "I have a love hate relationship with W hotels. Yes, they are hip and sexy and make me feel even less of both. I will say my gripes are not with the staff, they are uniformly excellent, and the beds are the best. But the W Downtown has some serious issues. First of all it overlooks a construction site, the work at which begins promptly at 7 am with pile drivers and jackhammers. Its not any construction site either. Its the Freedom Tower site, AKA Ground Zero. I asked to be moved for my second night but they explained that none of the rooms on the south side of the building had been opened yet? Really? Who's brilliant decision was it to open the rooms facing a major construction site first? And here is the thing that really pisses me off--no outlets by the bed. This is a BRAND NEW hotel and all hip and wifi-ed and stuff. Has the W designer never traveled on business? We want to plug in our phones on the night stand and use our laptops in bed and you hide the outlets behind immovable furniture? Scores of business travelers wish a pox upon your house. (at least the desk outlets are above the desk). And really, why is wi fi free at Motel 6 but $15 a day here? I guess if you have business on Wall Street, it is a great resource. But otherwise, the location sucks. The neighborhood is desolate after 6. Quiet.

My boyfriend and I booked the W New York Downtown for a 3-day birthday getaway. I was upgraded to a Spectacular Room by the GM Sofia and when I checked it, the staff recognized it was a special day and personally wished me a happy birthday. Lauren was my W Insider and she had left a birthday gift plus a signed birthday card from the staff! Inside my room was a tiny birthday cake and two cans of fizzy white wine. There was also a gorgeous tissue-stuffed bag containing a special texturized beach book, beach wipes and sunblock. Lauren knew from my boyfriend that we were going kayaking out in CT for a day. On the second day, I got another birthday card plus a rubber W luggage tag (very cute!) Note: Prior to my stay, Lauren contacted me and asked if I needed any help with reservations or suggestions. As a New Yorker, I didn't need any recos but took up her help in getting reservations to a notoriously difficult-to-get-reservations restaurant. Lauren and Joy (W Concierge) were able to score the reservations I wanted. Brilliant! ROOM The room itself was very comfortable. I'm not usually a fan of such modern design but it was very chic and warmer than I thought from the pics on the website. The bed was extremely comfortable (like all Starwood properties!) The shower is small but no smaller than most New York hotel rooms. The downside is the construction over the WTC. You'll get awesome views but construction starts at 7am Mon-Sat. We were on the 7th floor and across from the elevator. The walls are thin and so noise travels. We had an issue with the guest next door playing music (all rooms come with an ipod docking station) starting at 7am on a Sunday, the one day construction didn't occur. Luckily, we enjoyed his taste in music. The W also caters to a young crowd and our unfortunate location across from the elevator meant we heard noises until late into the night. LOCATION The location isn't ideal unless you live downtown and are looking for a stay-cation or are specifically coming to NYC to check out the WTC, the Statue of Liberty and other downtown sights. The subway is just a few blocks away so travel is convenient. Taxis are easy to pick up. Food and nightlife options aren't the best so far downtown but it's NY so it's still a good time. Walk about 10min and you'll be in Tribeca, a very hip part of NY filled with restaurants and bars. AMENITIES We tried the new BLT and it was amazing! Food is delicious and service is warm. We received a VIP card that among other things entitled us to 15% off all future visits. The Living Room Terrace at the W is gorgeous and drinks are well-made. Overall we enjoyed our visit immensely and would give this property 4.5 stars which the service really being a stand out.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "W New York - Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1462005-Reviews-W_New_York_Downtown-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$256 - $467*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">123 Washington Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10006</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1462005", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/88/7a/90/w-new-york-downtown-s.jpg"}}
