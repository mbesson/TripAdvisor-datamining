It was fully equipped with full kitchen, but none of it wotked. The stove etc were not connected. The microwave was not near a power piont. The air connditionig was not connected, thankfully the weather was beautifual and we didn't need it.The Hotel is magnificent. It has everything of a 5 star hotel. The massages are very expensive. The day tour to the Simatai Great Wall is also expensive if organised thru the hotel. Try to do it on the street, just mentionm the word Simatai and they will come running. Very few people speak any English but they are all very helpfull within their limits.", "Date": "May 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR473578234", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d582734-r8450846-Beijing_Shihao_International_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "582734", "Price": "$143"}}
