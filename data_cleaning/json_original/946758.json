Right around a good beerhouse. The quarter Kumkapi offers shops without tourist stuff. The restaurants in 2 min. reach are not overwhelming, but go to the harbour across Kennedy Cad., and you find good fish restaurants like Havuzbasi in 5 min. distance. The hotel is clean, the BF is what you expect in a 3-Star Turkish Hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was tiny and had not much place to stow things, leave them in your suitcase, and you're fine. TV (but who needs that when visiting Istanbul, a small fridge, a little cubic table.

The rooms are small, but not that was the biggest issue. The furniture is very old, but repainted recently, bathroom seems to be renovated recently, but there is mold on the tile filling; shower cabin was additionally fixed which made it very incontinent, though it was new; the tap was not fixed in toward the sink and it was moving every time when using it, the toilet was very old and unclean.

It's about a 5 minute walk uphill to the Grand Bazaar and a 15 minute walk to the Blue Mosque and Haga Sofya. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was basic. A double size bed, small t.v, hair dryer, and had air conditioning. It was also quite clean. We are non-smokers and we didn't find the room smelled like smoke (according to other reviews listed). The bathroom was small. After taking a shower there would always be a puddle on the floor. We asked to change rooms the first day we arrived because we thought it was an isolated case with our room, but we had the same problem in the other hotel room they put us in. We would have to put a few towels on the floor to soak up the water. The bathroom would smell moldy the rest of the night before the cleaning staff would come in the next morning to clean the room. After a full day out in Istanbul, it was a little bit of a chore to walk back to the hotel since it was a bit outside of the tourist area. And because the hotel is outside the tourist area, it might be a little unsafe for single women travelers to walk downhill past all the men on the side streets. You could take a cab back to the hotel but we always walked since it was only a downhill walk from the main road. Breakfast was included in the rate. The Turkish breakfast was always fresh and pretty tasty. Everyday the hotel would have a spread of boiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumber, cheese, olives, luncheon meat, an assortment of bread, corn flakes, tea, coffee, orange drink, and water. I would recommend this hotel if want to stay in a No Frills hotel and you don't mind the walk to and from the main tourist areas, but if my husband and I decide to go back to Istanbul, we would stay somewhere closer to the action.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limerick, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cDon't do it.....\u201d", "Author": "NewShoes76", "ReviewID": "UR45044321", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel with a friend recently for a week...From the moment we arrived there was trouble, First of all we were shown to our rooms which were right next to wide open door down the fire exit onto the street..V.dodgy!

The hotel is spotlessly clean, the water is hot and the showers powerful, the breakfasts do the job and the staff can't do enough for you. Very friendly, very kind, and made me endless cups of tea. A handy tip: the Kumkapi suburban railway station is just minutes away if you take a shortcut through the fish restaurants across the road. You can get a train to Sirkeci and change to the tram system there, or in the other direction I think it goes all the way to the airport.
