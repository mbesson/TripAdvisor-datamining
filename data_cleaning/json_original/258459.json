A very short stroll from the ferry, and would only be a five-minute walk from Wynyard train station. The hotel staff were very efficient, the place is very clean and everything is on your doorstep. Our budget choice involved a shared bathroom, but that actually wasn't a problem at all, as it was just across the landing. I would say the only negative thing was the bed, as it was sticking to the traditional theme of the place, it was old and uncomfortable. The breakfast was 'continental', but not just the basic white toast and rice bubbles. An assortment of breads, cereals, boiled eggs and lovely filtered coffee. I'm already looking forward to our next trip to Sydney.

The hotel is a renovated original building in the Rocks in Sydney. It is surrounded by restaurants, bars and shops. You are located amongst some of Sydneys' premier tourist sites and everything is nearby. The hotel itself is a renovated original 1800's building. Some rooms have an ensuite, and some use shared facilities. We had a room with an ensuite, that was massive. The room faced the rear of the building over an area known as the Nurses Walk. It was room number 15. Facing the rear meant no city views, but we only slept there, so that was no problem. The room was furnished with older style furniture, but it was all clean, and fresh. On the negative side, there was not a lot of free power points. The room had no fridge. The area got a little noisy at night. There was no free internet. There was very little storage space for toiletries in the bathroom. In defense of the hotel. Old buildings from the era of this building were hardly likely to have been built with modern electronic needs in mind. A small price for such a historic setting in my opinion. The lack of fridge is a little strange, but we got by without one for our 4 day stay. The area is in a restaurant, bar and tourist hub in Sydney, so what do you expect. Get out there and be a part of it! The internet issue is common to most hotels in Australia's large cities. That is just the backward way our hotels operate. As for the bathrooms, they should add more shelving. There was plenty of space. The hotel has an attached restaurant/wine bar. It is important to note that kids are not allowed in there at night. That was ridiculous given that families travel too. Anyway, that just meant that they never got any added value from our stay. all dinners were taken elsewhere. The toilet area by the wine bar also leads to a rear entry to another little gem. \"The Fortune of War\" pub. It claims to be the oldest pub in Sydney, and may just be. They have live bands on the weekend, and it is a great place to have a beer within the walls of a very historical old pub. Another great feature of the hotel was the roof top garden. This little terrace on the roof offers great photo opportunities, and makes a great place for a BYO drink. The hotel is very convenient to trains, ferries and buses. You really do not need a car if you are staying here. There is a train from the airport and once there, public transport is readily available. My four stars are for the charm of the property, the friendly staff and the location. Others may rate it lower, as the hotel is not abundant with services. But for me, it was 4. The inconveniences are not unexpected in such an old building, but the charm is actually in the age of the building, and the local history. Don't miss the weekend markets, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Fortune of War pub, the Argyle Pub and wondering around the old historical areas of the Rocks. These things are all available within 5 minutes of the hotel.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kapolei, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cExcellent in all ways\u201d", "Author": "happyretiree1968", "ReviewID": "UR126843191", "Content": "Located in The Rocks section of Sydney, The Russell is an ideal location for walking, sightseeing, and catching either the ferries or bus in Sydney. The hotel, built in the 1800's has historic charm and each room is different. Traveling on a budget, we reserved a \"shared bath\" room and found it to be just fine. The room was small, but they have a lovely sitting room with sofas, comfortable chairs and TV, so we had a very comfortable place to read, play cards, and watch TV -- usually by ourselves. The rooftop garden is also a very nice place to relax when the weather is good. The shared bathrooms are updated and on our floor there were two baths shared by seven rooms. Only once did I have to wait to use the bathroom and then I just went to the next floor -- no big deal. Bathrooms are cleaned several times a day so they always were fresh. They leave the doors to vacant rooms open and encourage guests to give themselves self-guided tours of other rooms. I found many lovely rooms with ensuite bathrooms -- great for those who want to upgrade. Robes, iron and ironing board, and a hot water pot with coffee and tea are provided in each room (instant coffee is typical in hotel rooms in Australia). Breakfast is included and is quite good: hard boiled eggs (still hot), various pastries and bread, fruit, yogurt and granola/cereals, juice and coffee -- what else does one need? Eating out in Australia is very expensive so we figured that The Russell saved us about $25.00/day in food expense. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

You do need an open mind when visiting The Russel and if you are to take away the maximum experience you need to realise that it is an old building in an old part of town.

Our room was basic with a double bed on suite with a television on a desk, kettle with tea and coffee, clothes iron, telephone and a desk. We did not have aircon but it was winter and an oil heater was provided. The daily housekeeping was good at keeping things clean and tidy but our seat cussions were stained and the carpets were due replacement. A few water stains on the wall could have been seen to. Breakfast is in the wine bar below the hotel and is a classic buffet breakfast of cerial, yogurt, croissants, toast, coffee and juice. The hotels winning appeal however is its location. Wow! And it is for this reason why I would choose to stay there again should I find myself in Sydney. You roll out of bed onto the ferrys, trains, busses and bustelling energy of The Rocks.

It was perfect! It is really small, but charming. Each room is different,witih quirky old-fashioned furniture. These are small rooms, with not a lot of modern conveniences, so the closet is an old-fashioned wardrobe. But the bathrooms were brand new and modern, and the shower was excellent. our deroom did not have an ensuite bathroom, but the hotel provides big fluffy white bathrobes for you to use when going to the bathroom.(You can pay extra and get an en-suite). There is a new elevator, so you don't have to carry your bags up the stairs any more. But the best thing is the location.... you are within a stone's throw of Circular Quay, just across a tiny park and beside the Museum of Modern Art. Could not be better. The hotel is also at the start of the Rocks, so you can stroll out to find a restuarant or pub on the Rocks. Ignore the first few you come across, these are a bit touristy, particularly the cheap pizza joint. Climb a bit further and they are more interesting. A German-style beer garden is good, and we found an ancient pub at the very top of the hill, which proclaims itself as Sydney's oldest, and they served great beer--- try the \"3 Sheets\" -- and pub food. Also worth a stroll are the cafes near the small harbour, on your way to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. There is a masted sailing ship amongst the cafes.... The downside of this hotel would be the lack of air conditioning, not a problem for us as we don't like aircon, but the quay can be noisy at night, and open windows mean that you do hear some noise at night. But in the morning you forget about all that as you go downto the breakfast which is included in the price.This is served in a newly re-vamped wine bar on the ground floor.You can look out at the Quay as you enjoy a great breakfast of croissants, fruit, yoghurt, tea or coffee, with a copy of the Sydney Morning Herald.

My sister and I were looking for a hotel near the International Port in Circular Quay for a one night stay as we were meeting friends disembarking from a cruise early the next day. We originally shied away from The Russell because of it's star rating and because the rooms available were not en-suite and we would have to share a bathroom. However, after checking out photos of the hotel on the web, and seeing the prices of several other hotels in the area, we decided to take a chance and stay overnight in the hotel because of the excellent location for our needs and because of the excellent value. The room was $140 for a double, including breakfast compared with the next cheapest hotel we could find which was $308 for the same. We caught a train from the airport to Circular Quay (6 stops = $15) and made our way to the Russell Hotel which is in The Rocks area. It was approximately a 10 minutes stroll from the train and the Hotel only 6 minutes walk from the Port which is in the next street. The hotel was such a surprise! After putting our luggage in our room, we decided to have dinner in the restaurant on the ground floor. I can't speak highly enough of the presentation and quality of the food, not to mention the friendliness of the staff. The bedroom we stayed in was a double on the second floor. The room was spotlessly clean and well equipped and lovingly decorated in period style. Bathrobes were supplied, along with white fluffy towels, tea and coffee making supplies and chocolates on our bed which was turned down for the night. The Hotel is on a busy street and you can hear the traffic and the ferry horns if you leave the window open. This was not a problem for us but it might be for some during warmer weather. There is a ceiling fan but no airconditioning which could be uncomfortable in very hot weather, again no problem for our stay. The two bathrooms on our floor were spotless, one being especially large and recently renovated with a double shower. The lady who checked us in was extremely friendly and helpful. There is a guest lounge complete with comfortable couches and a large screen TV, and on the top floor is a lovely private roof garden. The Hotel corridors are quite narrow but almost all are lined with windows so it's very bright, and they have a modern, very fast lift which is very important because there are LOTS of quite narrow stairs which would otherwise be a problem for older or less moble travellers. The best suprise was the buffet breakfast in the restaurant - a light breakfast but beautifully presented and regularly restocked. The background music was discreet and again, the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. My sister and I were so impressed with the Hotel that we intend to return later in the year with our husbands for a longer stay to allow us to explore The Rocks area more fully and enjoy the ambience of the Hotel.

The Russell Hotel promised to provide a boutique venue for sleeping and whiling away the downtime found in the average travel day. Alas, we were so terribly disappointed! My mother and I had booked very early in May 2010, for mid-October 2010. This five day trip to Sydney was to be a graduation gift for me from my parents to congratulate my recent degree. We had planned for months and confirmed our reservation after trawling through hundreds of sites and hotel reviews. We recieved a confirmation via email for a DOUBLE room for us to share. As posted on their website, it clearly states that all rooms have double beds - we did not mind bunking together to save a few bucks! The day prior to our departure for Sydney we rang to confirm credit details. After some confusion it was discovered that an \"error\" had been made with our booking, and we were booked in a SINGLE room, for the duration of our stay. Apologies were made and we were eventually offered a room upgrade for nights 1 and 3, but would have to stay in a single room with a roll out bed for nights 2 and 4. Our rate would be discounted. However, we would have to move rooms every night, and the single rooms were reported to be so small that a roll out bed would leave standing room only in the room. For the reduced price of $100 AUD per night, this was ridiculous. May I remind the traveller that this booking error was ENTIRELY THEIR FAULT - which they readily admitted to. We decided that for the price were paying, we would not be happy with these less than satisfactory arrangements. We requested they find us somewhere else to stay. They refused. The day before we were due to leave, we were now expected to find our own accomodation in a city that was nearly booked out. We were offered a room in KINGS CROSS (a known 'red light district') for the same price as a boutique hotel in The Rocks - a trendy and centrally located area in the CBD. We declined. I am sad to say that this experience nearly ruined our trip entirely - accomodation being pretty essential when travelling. For what was supposed to be a real treat, girl's week in Sydney, this was appalling. Fortunately we were able to secure our own accomodation that was OK. However, the flippant attitude of the Russell Hotel staff and their refusal to assist us was unbelievable. I have never encountered such a blatant disregard for a situation they caused themseleves. The offer of a cramped room and four room changes for only a small reduction in price was absurd and rude considering the way we wanted to spend our holiday. Appalling.

It is probably the best located hotel in The Rocks as it is situated at quay level. Most of the other (more expensive) establishments are up the steep hill or flights of steps. However this is a tired, budget hotel so your expectations should be set low with regard to rooms and facilities. (For instance there was no in-room safe in our room - so you have to remember to collect your passports from the reception safe, as the receptionist does not remind you!!!).

The waiter at breakfast gave us some great inside tips on things to do which we would not have gleaned from guidebooks. The room for breakfast is extremely pleasant, with large windows looking onto the bustling street outside. The hotel is right by Circular Quay, so ferries to the Zoo (a must!), Manly, Watson's Bay etc are right on hand. Lean out of the front and you can see the Harbour Bridge dominating the view at the end of the street. So what makes this hotel most worthwhile is its location - as others have said, right in the centre of the Rocks, but for us just as importantly right by the ferry terminal. Rooms at the front are not quiet - the Rocks is a centre for nightlife and we were woken a fair bit by drunks outside and dustbin lorries collecting bottles, but then it is in the centre of a large city, so this sort of thing is to be expected.

Far from it! Though we could not afford a room with ensuite bath, our 135 AUD room shared a bath with only one or two other rooms and we never had to wait for a shower or toilet. (There were actually several bathrooms we could choose from in the event that one was busy.) The Russell's rooms - we peeked in many open doors - were all unique and reminded us of Grandma's house, with antique furnishings and period wallpaper. Though on the small side, our room (#4) was well furnished with a large wardrobe, a glass topped desk/table with chair, a large mirror, two night stands with reading lamps, a side dresser with about 18 drawers (an antique filing cabinet of sorts), an overhead fan and a large window with venetian blinds. The only thing we could have asked for is a sink in the room. A stay at the Russell includes breakfast in their lower level dining room (no longer a restaurant open to the public). Everyone gets fruit, cereal and yoghurt along with coffee or tea, plus a choice of other options including croissants or eggs.

We really enjoyed Sydney, and a big part of that was due to the location and comfort of our hotel. One tip: Although a shuttle from the airport is a great way to get TO the Russell, I would recommend only booking it one-way. It is much faster to take the train back to the airport, IF you have a manageable amount of luggage. It's a 2 minute walk to the Circular Quay station, and once you are on the train, it's only 12 minutes to the airport. Our shuttle ride took almost an hour, and duplicated the scenic route it took on the way into town, stopping at multiple hotels to pick up other passengers.

It cost $240 a night but with the extra charge for paying with Amex - it cost an extra $20 a night. However the staff did warn about that on day 1 - so if I wanted to I could have paid with cash to avoid it, however I didn't have $500 spare cash. None of the taxi drivers knew where the hotel was. I would suggest saying to them it's just past the \"Four Seasons\" because they all know where that is. What struck me immediately was what an enormous shame that they didn't use the restaurant. It's on the ground floor - with passing trade from the street - they would make a fortune on it! This is not a place for unwell, unfit or disabled people. The stairs up to reception are rather steep & quite narrow. I found it a little bit hard to get my small suitcase up it. Then once you check in - there's another long stairway. For me this was not a problem because I'm young and reasonably fit. My room was #14 (en-suite), which is as far away from the stairs/corridors as you can get. The window faces the police station next door. It was a good sized room, had TV, hair-dryer, iron/ironing board, kettle. The room itself is in need of some TLC. You could tell the staff did everything they could to get the room as spotless as humanly possible. However you could see the paint buckling & looking faded & the absence of a fan in the bathroom had caused mould in the past (however the staff scrubbed it with bleach every day so it wasn't actually any mould there anymore). The bed was comfy & clean. The touch of chocks on the pillow every day was sweet. I couldn't get the A/C to work (I could get it to turn on but it just wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go cold), but there was a ceiling fan to take the worst of the heat. The location is superb, lots of pubs, restaurants, the harbour bridge, opera house all within a very short walk. However the 2 reasons I probably wouldn't stay there again is that I think it was quite a bit to pay $240 a night but the real killer was the doors. Each door is pulled shut to lock (ie there is no handle to do this without noise). On the second night, the people in the room opposite me had no respect. Every time they left the room they would slam it shut. It was as loud as if it been my own door. At 2am one of them went to the toilet (that room is shared bath) and again slammed the door hard enough to wake me up. Now imagine a pair of party people staying next door = no sleep at all. I can only imagine how noisy it would be to stay in one of the rooms of the main corridor. This place could be such a winner if it was just fixed up a bit.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brentwood, Essex", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "hsgowers", "ReviewID": "UR12913699", "Content": "What a great hotel!

Charming and historic, a hotel with alot of character and warmth! The location cannot be beat. You're a two minute walk from the the harbor, the Circular Quay and a breathtaking view of the Harbor Bridge AND the Opera House. The best part about staying at this hotel was the neighborhood, a maze of cobblestone streets and charming restaurants and shops. That being said, it is located on George St. which is lined with a few pubs, restaurants and shops. During our stay on a Monday and Tuesday night we noticed more of a afterwork crowd, not a drunk people spilling onto the streets scene. Our room was not on the street but on a side street and only one night we heard some pub crawlers boisterously making their way back home at 2 am but it was brief and we chuckled thinking how our \"pub crawl\" lasted only two pubs and we were in bed by ten! Other reviewers have greatly over exxagerated \"all those stairs\" it's one stairway up and they will help you with your bags(we travel light but we saw the staff helping other people up with thier overstuffed suitcases). Advice to travelers in general is DON'T PACK SO MUCH! Speaking of the staff, they were awesome! Our flight arrived early in the morning. We got to the hotel at 9am and our room was ready to go even though check in is not until 3pm. We were so grateful to come to our cozy room and catch some zzz's after our long flight from California. Our room, though small, had everything you would need: Bathrobes, a coffee press, iron and ironing board, hairdryer, etc. The decor was lovely, the armoir beautiful and all the drawers in the dresser worked(functional and appealing). There were two bathrooms down the hall. One was spacious and pristine with lotion, and shampoo, and body wash. The other was very small; a wash closet on one side to shower and across from it was the toilet seperate but I never had to use this one. The spacious and spotless bathroom down the hall was always available. In the lobby there's a computer available to go on online and the staff was always helpful pointing us in the right direction of a caesar salad that I was craving. However, there's SO many eating options you can't go wrong. The breakfast downstairs was wonderful! You could get a full hot breakfeast with eggs, bacon and toast in addition to cereal, fruit, pastries, juices, coffee, tea... the works! We would fill up on breaky in the beautiful restaurant/breakfast room downstairs and be fueled up for a day of sight seeing. We had such great experience! We would not hesitate to return. We paid $110 a night for a double room. I believe we stayed in the cheapest and smallest room available AND I think we may have paid considerably less considering we got the rooom through a hotel broker at NeedItNow(the australian equivalent of orbitz).

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in other hotels with shared restrooms, and this is one of the better ones. Only two to three rooms share a restroom, and they were always clean. A laptop with Internet was available in the lobby from early in the morning until late at night. There was a ten-minute time limit if someone was waiting, but it was free to guests. Breakfast was provided in the restaurant downstairs, the price of which was included in the room charge. It was so filling that we usually had a biscuit or two leftover to take for a snack. We were there in the winter, and the room stayed well-heated throughout the night. The Bad It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right across from the Circular Quay and on a main street, so it was noisy.

The reception is on the first floor straight up the stairs, you don't have to carry your bags up straight away, you can leave them in the foyer and they will be brought up for you. Assistance is available but you will have to ask at reception first. George street which the hotel is located on is a great location for shopping, transport, sightseeing, eating and drinking but, it is a very very busy road.

The points made previously about there being a lot of stairs are true - if you're staying at the top of the hotel it does give you a bit of a work out going up and down them on a hot day but if you're fit and healthy it shouldn't be too much of a problem! The room was clean but rather tired looking - we found the main problem was lack of space. There were 2 shared bathrooms near us; one very large with 2 sinks and one smaller which were absolutely fine. Breakfast was good and we found the staff to be friendly.
