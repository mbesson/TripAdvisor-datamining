While the room was spacious and clean, we did run into some problems with the services offered by the hotel. First, they charge 20dh for internet service, which is fine, but the connection was consistently slow - it would take about 20 minutes to just get to my email account. If I'm paying for internet, I prefer for it to work at least relatively well. We found the hotel staff to be cordial, but generally unhelpful. It was sometimes difficult to make questions understood, and almost always impossible to get a direct answer. The rooftop pool is very small, and a hotel staff member must accompany you to the pool if you wish to use it, and then stay there. My fiance and I wanted to go up to swim one evening, a request which was begrudgingly met by the reception desk, as this means that one of them must leave their work to babysit you, then stand there on the side while you swim - you can see where this could get awkward. It just didn't make for a very enjoyable (and certainly not romantic) pool experience, since you have someone standing there staring at you whole clearly just wants you to leave. No balconies and the bathroom was a little bit run-down, but I can say that everything was clean - the bed had a washable duvet cover, which is an important feature at least to me. Good location, and close to the metro. Overall, the hotel was in a great location, but there were too many small annoyances for us to consider staying here again. There must be better places in Dubai at this price point.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kathmandu, Nepal", "Title": "\u201cYo Dubai\u201d", "Author": "Bhuwannp", "ReviewID": "UR120871053", "Content": "I had stayed in this hotel from 8 to 12 november 2011 and had a pleasant stay in the heart of amazing Dubai city hotel is just amazing with good big room and also economy friendly with budget rate", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "istanbul", "Title": "\u201cinsects in the room\u201d", "Author": "ozcan k", "ReviewID": "UR120447621", "Content": "I have stayed 4 nights in this hotel.There were a lot of insects (some of them small but most of them big) in the room.the room was not clean.Bed sheets were dirty.We changed them but the new ones were also dirty.I think they were so old.The room needs refurnished.the breakfast was poorly.The location was good.You may go everywhere by metro.You may buy everything from the supermarket.Staf was good and helpful.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cBrand New\u201d", "Author": "AG4E", "ReviewID": "UR117965636", "Content": "Since the hotel is brand new, everything was in order and working right, helping the place stand out other three-star hotels nearby.

Although the hotel was very small, compared to most other hotels I\u2019ve been to, the rooms were spacious enough. The reasonable rates were the best part and the food was also good. However, the hotel\u2019s very small pool and gym is not something you could rely on for workouts.

Accomodating and quick to manage requests (Eg: Iron boards, quick laundry) - Clean rooms and property. Gym and simming pool exist, however, I did not use them - The bed in my room was a double bed but relatively small. However, still comfortable and cosy enough to sleep at night - Internet needs to be purchased @ AED 20 for 24 hrs. Found it reasonable. Good speed and no connectivity problems - Safe.
