You are at 5 minutes walk of the Seine. And you have 2 metro stations at 5 minutes walk too. The breakfast in the hotel is awesome, really tasteful. The bedroom is big (bare in mind you are in Paris, nothing is really big, but this one stands out). The bed is comfortable enough to have a great night sleep. If you like to walk you are really close to beautiful places like Notre Dame or the Louvre. Thanks to the hotel staff Paris was really easy to get to know.

We settled on the 5th arr., and began to weed through the many hotel choices in that area. We confirmed the Artus after looking through pictures of the area on google earth and when we realized they served complimentary breakfast (which consisted of croissants, breads, crepes, fruit and fresh squeezed fruit juice, coffee and tea) each morning. We had been to Europe before and knew to expect small rooms and this was no exception. However, this is the case at EVERY hotel in this price range in Paris so just know that going into it and expect it. The staff at the Artus are all very pleasant and speak perfect English and French. They are knowledgeable about the local area which was helpful to us every day, as we did not have a structured itinerary. The head concierge is named Sanjay, and he is an attribute to the hotel. He always asked us how things were going, gave advice on restaurants and attractions, etc. At night we would make dinner reservations for us at restaurants that always lived up to his suggestion. The temperature of our room was a little stuffy the first night we were there and I was unable to get the air conditioner to turn on. I made mention of it to Sanjay the next morning and by the time we returned to the hotel that same evening the room was cool and comfortable. Apparently the setting was on \"heat\" only because of the season and needed to be manually overridden by hotel staff. Needless to say, the staff are professional and attentive. Location, location, location...Artus Hotel is near the corner of a very busy street and a small street with lots of restaurants. My wife and I arrived on a Saturday, and that night the locale was alive with people enjoying their weekend. There are Cafes and bistros very close by (next to the hotel in fact). Some famous ones like Les Deux Magots and Cafe Flore are two blocks away, and there are literally dozens of others within walking distance. Many of the great attractions are within a 5 minute walk from Artus (Notre Dame, Jardin de Luxembourg). Metro and bus stops were all very, very close. There is a metro stop across the street, but a major metro stop, called St. Germain des-pres, with connections to the RER train(to/from CDG) and other major metro lines, was a block away. Now for the room...Our room was cozy but well appointed. We had a real stand-up shower, vanity area and a toilet area. There was a Queen-sized bed with enough room around it to walk around and get dressed. The room had a desk, phone, and bedside tables. there was an armoire with drawers and a space in the bottom to slide our empty luggage in. As i stated in the beginning, the area was loud the first night we got there. Our room was on the first floor (room 114) facing the street. Although they call it the first floor it is actually the second. The reception area, which is on street level is considered floor 0, while below street level is called -1 and what Americans would call the second floor is called floor 1. The windows are all double glass and they drown out a lot of noise but one can still here some of the reveling (which goes late into the night on weekends). However, in our room was a Bose iPod dock with speaker, and I was able to play some \"sleep music\" which canceled out any remaining noise from outside. In summation, this is a fantastic hotel in a wonderful location in Paris. The staff will ensure that your stay is pleasant. Have fun!", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA great hotel, really!\u201d", "Author": "Lune14", "ReviewID": "UR126709150", "Content": "You get a good measure of the service of a hotel when a few hours after booking you receive a mail from the concierge to offer you assistance for the upcoming trip. As per the many reviews here, Sanjay has such a touch for welcoming the guests of Artus that I can now attest that his reputation is rightfully deserved. Artus is located in the busiest strip of the 6th district, close to the St Germain church, which is my favorite portion of this area. There are limitless choices for dining and shopping literally as soon as you stumble out of the hotel. Despite that, with a room facing the inner courtyard, I got very little noise in the room except for a Saturday evening. Many hotels in this area have old windows, so the double glazed windows here were definitely a plus! All in all, the hotel hits high marks in all right points: location, the friendliest staff you find in Paris (from reception to the cleaning and restaurant staff, they were all wonderful), clean, decent room size and awesome rain shower! Try to book the room directly with the hotel with breakfast icluded. It was a superb continental option (some cooked items also), which included delicious breads and pastries, cheeses and meats, and to my great delight fresh juices (both grapefruit and orange, voila!) and fruit. You will hardly get better than this in Paris or elsewhere. This is definitely not the most luxurious hotel in Paris or in the area, but with the location, room features and above all, service, you just can't beat the value it offers.

And, because we knew we could count on him, we made a number of requests to the concierge Sanjay for tickets to the ballet and opera and a couple of other concerts and Paris museum passes. He didn't fail us--excellent seats and even wangled decent seats for the opening night of an opera at Opera Comique. The breakfast is priced at 20 Euros, and that cost might encourage exploration of other places in the neighborhood, however by booking on the hotel's own website (and prepaying), the breakfast was included at no extra charge. Compared to the usual Parisian 'very petite dejeuner' of other establishments, the meal is a winner. AND Breakfast is available from 7 am until 11 am. (This meant that on arrival the first morning, before the rooms were ready we could repair to the basement and enjoy excellent coffee and excellent food.) The location remains extremely convenient. Three metro stations are nearby, and a number of bus lines pass the vicinity. Walking the neighborhoodl is part of the experience, Rue de Buci and it's extension Rue Saint Andres-des Artes, offer an interesting range of shops, markets and restaurants, and if followed to Place Saint Michel, put you close to Notre Dame and to Sainte Chapelle. (Go early to avoid long lines.) The rooms are not large, but most folks don't go to Paris to watch CNN on the telly! We found it convenient to use taxis to museums--plenty of walking after reaching the Louvre or Musee d'Orsay. Here I would add a pitch for the Paris pass for museums. At least during holiday periods, the lines to enter can be huge and standing on a line for an hour or more is not the best preparation for exploring the arts inside. An additional suggestion--check out the local Marche St Germaine which is a block south of the intersection just down from the hotel; also get directions to the Village Voice Bookshop--a very good \"Anglo-American\" shop with a wide selection of books on Paris and France. I mention these local attractions simply as a pointer to how one can pace a visit to Paris--something in the morning, relaxation in the locality in the afternoon before a concert in the evening. In summation, the Artus is a great place to stay.

The bed wasn't a double but two singles with single matresses pushed together. Really disappointing if you are a couple trying to have a romantic weekend in Paris! On our final night we arrived back to the room to find that the coffee had not been replaced, empty milk packets next to the coffee machine and two dirty coffee mugs next to our bed with a satisfaction survey next to them! The air conditioning is quite noisey and you can hear people in nearby rooms taking showers etc. The wall on one side of the room had black scuff marks all over it and needed to be cleaned or re-painted as it really looked quite bad. Everything else was clean though. Breakfast was included but was nothing special and the service was poor. It took a while for someone to offer us coffee and even longer for them to bring us milk. The breads and cheese, cereals were nice but the scrambled eggs were tasteless. You would expect better for this class of hotel. They serve it 7:30 till 11 but one morning we Caen down at 10:15 and pretty much everything had gone and they were not replacing anything. They have a self service coffee machine in reception which looks free but they see you using it and charge 2:50 to room a pop. Sneaky! The staff were friendly and I liked the two big umbrellas in the wardrobe for us to use. Generally it Was not bad and we had a comfortable stay but I really think you can find better for the money and will probably try a B&B nexttime.

We were looking for a hotel on the left bank in the vicinity of the latin quarter and close to a Metro station. Artus was recommended to us by a friend and, based on the consistently positive reviews we read on TripAdvisor, we booked it. It was a good call. The hotel is located 400 yards away from the St Germain metro station, in a street off Blvd St Germain. The busy boulevard's noise drops off as soon as you turn into the hotel's street and by the time you are in your room it's so quiet you have a hard time believing you're in Paris. The rooms are typical size for continental hotels. The bathroom was roomy. The quality of the bed and the linens was superb (we stayed in room 131). The central air was dependable but don't expect the polar experience of American hotels. The hotel's online info and promotional material describe the room accurately. Free WiFi is available throughout the hotel and worked well in our room. The seating area at the lobby is spacious, comfortable, and well appointed. We did not have breakfast in the hotel because there were at least 3 boulangeries within 2 minute walk from the hotel and nothing beats a fresh warm croissant au beur in the morning, with a spot of cafe au lait. This hotel is situated near three very interesting locations: the Mariage Frere, a phenomenal purveyor of fine teas; Roger la Grenouille, the most respectable frog legs restaurant in Paris; and Laduree, a chic macaroons maker. All three are within 5 minutes walk from the hotel and we were very lucky to be able to visit them. The hotel's quaint street (Rue de Buci) turns into Rue St. Andres Des Arts and both are full of cafes, brasseries, and quite a few tourist shops. In summary this is a great hotel to be used as headquarters from venturing out and about the left bank and even further afield. We booked our room in advance and got a great rate.

We LOVE this hotel. (This is the first time I post an online hotel review, as I am usually too lazy to write one. This is an indication of how much I think this hotel deserve to be praised.) Room- We stay in the classic room, it\u2019s not big (just like most of the hotel rooms in Paris) but the chic and modern design make up for it. The queen size mattress of medium firmness is very comfortable and the Housekeeping does a very good job keeping the room very clean. Some reviews complain about the noise on the streets. In my experience, the room is very nice and quiet every day. It only gets a bit noisier on Saturday night when locals and tourists enjoy their late night out in the lively Saint-Germain neighborhood. But the hotel room\u2019s double glazed windows kept most of the sound out and we didn\u2019t have any problem sleeping at all. It\u2019s a matter of choice, if you want to stay in a lively and energetic area with countless cafes and musicians playing on the streets, a small and reasonable amount of sounds from the street has to be expected. Beside from the jetlag, we slept soundly for all 7 nights. Service- All the hotel staffs, including the famous Concierge Sanjay, are super friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to make your stay feel like home, helping us daily with directions and restaurant reservations. They attend to details that other big hotels normally do not. One time when coming back from a rainy day, we found that Housekeeping has left an umbrella in our room even though we did not request for one, we thought it was quite a special touch. Breakfast- Breakfast is included in our reservation so we had breakfast in the hotel every morning. The American-style breakfast has more varieties of food than I\u2019ve expected. It has all the \u201cbasis items\u201d like scramble eggs, sausage, bacon plus a nice selection of cheese and fresh fruit daily. A very nice way to start a day in Paris. Location- The hotel\u2019s location right in the middle of Saint Germian is unbeatable. Countless specialty shops, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, food markets are just right outside the doorsteps! The hotel is about 3 mins walk from the metro station and 10 mins from the riverside (I am a slow walker as my husband always complain ^_^). We walked to Louvre Museum, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay and Notre Dame all within 15-20 mins. I suppose one can do it faster if they walk fast, but it\u2019s a very nice stroll along the way to most of these places, with galleries and antiques stores along the pavements on the way to the riverside.

It is either in the Latin Quarter or just outside - we have wandered all over Paris, and this is a great area to stay. It was busy at all hours of day and night, so you feel very safe, and the busyness isnt tourists - its locals, which just makes the experience so much better. A plethora of great bars, restaurants and shops, cool little side streets, minutes away from the Notre Dame and the Seine.....just great. Its fairly far from the Eiffel Tower/Arc de Triomphe, but just use the metro! Honestly, we stayed near the Eiffel Tower and the area is kind of barren except for tourists. Location is best for if you want to go out at night/for apertifs, but also good for anyone really. Room: Small, but thats expected in Paris. Really clean, modern and well maintained. Bed was lovely - really comfortable and nice linens. Good pillows. Bathroom is a bit strange (a curtain as a door!) but clean, pretty spacious and good shower. Free wi fi that was REALLY fast. Nice tea! Service: Lovely service, great English skills and helpful. We wanted extra nights, and they had no availability, but in the morning we got a call from them letting us know they had availability due to a cancellation - and we hadnt asked them to call!

The room was great (small, but probably big compared to other Paris hotels) everything was very clean, and the shower was great.

He called us before our stay to see if there was anything he could do for us. He made dinner reservations for us before we arrived and even printed out the map quest route to walk to the restaurants and put it in our room for us. He also called a car for us to pick us up from the train station for 50 euros -- which wasn't cheap but well worth it. The driver was waiting for us at the end of the quay with a sign with our name on it. We had breakfast included and it was just fine. They had croisants, cereal, yogurt, egss & bacon. I don't know if it is included for everyone, but was easy enough to grab a quick bite before heading out for the day. if you don't have breakfast included there are plenty of little cafe's on the hotel's street and a Paul across the street which has all the croisants and pastries, etc. Bottom line - this was a GREAT hotel and I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Paris.

The room were relatively large by European standards. The room fittings and furniture was modern and relatively new. Most importantly, the bedding was clean and very comfortable. The front desk staff spoke very good English and were very keen to assist with any questions we had and were on hand to offer recommendations to plenty of good restaurants around the area. The location of the hotel was ideal as we were only going to have 1 full day in Paris. The hotel itself is situated in the heart of the Latin quarters off Boulevard Saint-Germain. In terms of attractions, the hotel is just a short stroll from Institut de France and just across from there the Musee du Louvre. The Notre Dame is just 15 minutes away. There are plenty of restaurants around so you don\u2019t have to travel far for a cocktail or a good meal. For those who like a bit of shopping, it is definitely the place to be. Shoppers will be spoilt for choice as there is mixture of famous high end and mid range fashion boutiques, a selection of gourmet food stores, art gallerias and antique shops and not to mention stores specialising in Paris memorabilia. As a whole, the hotel met all our expectations and needles to say, we are very pleased to have made this choice! We will definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Paris!", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, NY", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite hotel!\u201d", "Author": "35Clark", "ReviewID": "UR20831136", "Content": "I spend about 100 days per year traveling, and the Artus is my favorite hotel anywhere.

The hotel was clean and the service was responsive throughout. There is no question that the principal concierge Sanjay is a master of his profession and his attention to details and anxiety to be helpful was truly outstanding. The rest of the staff were also extremely helpful. The rooms, as with most Paris hotels, were small--we had a 'superior room' that had windows into an inner courtyard; very quiet, nicely appointed--and much more storage space than the allegedly 5-star hotel in which we had been staying in London prior to our arrival. No closet, true, but the armoire proved adequate along with some shelves. We found the heating to be fine--responsive and quiet. A major plus for the Artus, is that just outside is the virtual center of the Left Bank--rue Buci and its extensions are great places to just 'be' for a while; good cafes, a number of satisfactory restaurants in the vicinity--we enjoyed the branch of Leons of Bruxelles--amazing mussels--just at the opposite corner of Buici and Blvd Saint-Germaine-des-Pres. Walking distance to Notre Dame, Ste Chappelle, the Cluny Museum--tho' we try never to walk to a Museum, the Louvre (ditto) and if you are really fit, the Musee Orsay. Two Metro stations are close at hand and some very convenient bus routes. Our rate was not cheap--I think it was 243 Euros--it included a very fine breakfast that included eggs and bacon/sausage, plus pastries, breads, cheeses, fruit, toast and some fine coffee. The only glitch was that one morning when the regular breakfast room server was off, a request for decaf coffee produced hot water and some powder. The rest appeared to be brewed and hearty decaf coffee. One drawback was that the wireless internet access in the room was on a pay basis. A free PC in the lobby offered no-cost internet access.

The room was tiny but clean and the shower was lovely. Bed was large and comfortable with great bedding. The toiletries provided in the room were obviously recycled from visitors past (in little customized \"ARTUS\" boxes and jars) and were looking a little worn. Cleaning was acceptable. Closet space was tight but efficient, there was no iron. Front desk staff were a mixed bag. We had nothing but good experiences (although one night we waited quite a long time for the night staff to answer the doorbell and let us in when we rang at around 12:30 am). The internet was unusable during our stay - one of the night staff kindly looked up baseball scores for us which was lovely. We saw a couple of women show up to check in one afternoon, looking extremely travel-weary and with two large heavy-looking bags each, who were told by the two women at the front desk (who had no other guests to help) that the guests would have to lug their bags up to their rooms by themselves as there were no male desk staff working who could help them. I don't expect valet service, but a small kindness goes a long way. The decor is dated but the lobby is clean and at times the hotel smelled a little odd, but we generally enjoyed our hotel stay for what it was - a super jumping-off spot from which to enjoy Paris. Incidentally, if you don't mind walking about 800 meters with luggage on a quiet street then it's a direct metro trip to CDG airport from (I think) the Saint Michel station. This was a huge bonus for us. Local restaurants were fantastic, especially Allard. The Paris Pass was a colossal waste of money, but the (MUCH MUCH CHEAPER) Paris Museum Pass (which can be purchased at any museum) is a great deal.

We booked our room via Expedia for $245/night. I feel we got a good value for the price. After all, this IS Paris. Yes, the room (132) was small, but it was clean, the bed was comfortable, the pillows perfect. The only complaints that I had, which I shared with a receptive Sanjay, was that the rug was showing signs of wear, and the paint on the wall in the toilet area was chipping. The modern decor of the lobby and breakfast area was perfect. Breakfast downstairs was good if you didn't want to face Paris too early. And at 15 euros each, it was comparable to what a decent breakfast would cost. The location is great, the St. Germain des Pres area is full of activity, and anything you could want is steps away. It was a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights, very, very late, but it's a small price to pay for the location. The small gripe we do have was the heating system would make a annoying noise each time it would turn on/off. Not good when you're just about to drift off to sleep.

We will stay there again on our next trip to Paris.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and close to nutella-filled crepes too!\u201d", "Author": "DC/VATravelGirl", "ReviewID": "UR8063763", "Content": "I just returned yesterday from a 6 day trip to Paris with my girlfriends and we could not have been happier with the Hotel Artus. No review would be complete without acknowledging and thanking Sanjay for being the perfect host, travel guide and smiling face after returning from a long day of sightseeing (and shopping, boy did we do a lot of shopping). There were four of us total so we had 2 per room (Room 101 and 111). We were told that Room 101 was the largest in the hotel and it was very big compared to what one normally gets in Europe. The bed was comfortable with nice linens (though no top sheet which might just be European but sort of plays on my yuck factor) and the bathroom was huge. The weird thing about the shower in Room 101 is that there is no shower door, curtain, pane of glass - nada. So, with a rain-type shower head you basically get water everywhere but we made do and covered the floor in towels which was fine. There is a small armoire which was plenty big enough for two of us and a small desk and flat screen TV. The hotel was not very noisy (aside from a small child screaming for apricot juice at an early hour) and we slept great even though we were on the street level. Room 111 was very similar to ours although their shower had a half a pane of glass which probably helped with splashing! The lobby is very modern with comfy couches and cool artwork and though we never made it downstairs for breakfast (why eat in the hotel when there are tons of great cafes right around the corner and a crepe stand 2 blocks away on St. Germain Blvd - did I mention the crepe stand yet? It's right outside St. Germain church and is truly a divine experience.) You can't beat the hotel for location as it's super close to the metro but I must say we pretty much walked everywhere as the city is very walkable and you get to see more (especially when the gay pride parade is going on which I highly recommend for a unique Parisian experience - it rivals NYC and Washington DC for sure! Great fun!). Anyway, I am pretty picky about my hotels and typically try to stay in 4/5 stars in the US and prefer hotels like the W, Ritz and Four Seasons (when I can get a good deal) and this hotel, while not Ritz-level, has the vibe of a W with the hospitality of a cozy bed and breakfast. It was so nice to be able to stop for drinks at the end of the day at Cafe Mabillon or Chai and just pop back into the room to change or drop off bags. There are plenty of great restaurants and we had an amazing pre-departure Italian meal at Del Papa which is only 2 doors from the Artus. Don't miss the spaghetti bolognese or carbonara and frankly it's a nice change from jambon and fromage! There is plenty of shopping right around the hotel and lots of art galleries for window shopping. We felt very very safe in the area and the cafes were hopping until 2am and on though we never heard much if any street noise. We searched and searched in an attempt to find the right hotel in Paris and we did not go wrong with the Artus. It's Fodor's rated which made us feel a little more secure but trust us, you'll be very happy here. Ask Sanjay about where to go, where to eat, or even for a car to get you back to the airport at 6am (that held lots of bags filled with sale month goodies!) and you will not be disappointed. He's just the best as we can't say enough good things about him. Try restaurant Entrecote and Cafe Visconti for dinner in the neighborhood too. There's also great gelato right around the corner and a crepe stand. Did we mention the crepe stand?! I think my thighs now look like nutella-filled crepes after this trip but boy was it worth it.

The heating and air conditioning system is superb as are the windows and the rooms are quiet. Sanjay, the concierge, is a joy. He is extremely helpful with all the details of life in a large European capital. He made excellent restaurant suggestions and made reservations, summoned taxies, and generally made the stay a pleasure. The remainder of the staff is very helpful as well.

The public space computer is a great feature (although I found it not working twice, the manager let me use her own computer behind the reception desk, which was very thughtful). The location can't be beat -- 5 minutes walk to St. Michele, 2 minutes walk to Cafe Deux Magots. It's on a busy market street, which for some could be a negative feature but for me was a positive -- as a single traveller I like to blend in when outside, and I found any number of sidewalk cafes within two blocks of the hotel where I could sit alone with a book and a glass of wine to pass the time.
