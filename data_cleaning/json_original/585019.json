But no -- we had a great stay for all the reasons that have been amply explained already on here. Whether 4 or 5 stars depends really on criteria -- not of standards of care, cleanliness, decor, setting or charm (all as fine as most others report; so too breakfast) but whether you are expecting facilities additional to your lodging. Essentially there aren't any: there is the lounge and garden and that's that. This would lead me, for all my enthusiasm, not to join a previous reviewer in calling it \"one of the great hotels of the world.\" It doesn't purport to be -- it's a top-notch bed-and-breakfast establishment.

Our room was in itself good and spacious, tastefully and not routinely decorated. The mosquito netting that covered each of the four windows was much appreciated -- we never discovered whether it was needed, but were glad not to have to find out the hard way. The problems we had, however, were rather too numerous to give this place unqualified praise. After 24 hours we discovered that the minibar-fridge was actually keeping things warm. The next day we found the air conditioning was simply recycling uncooled air, and for May it was hot, into the 90s Fahrenheit. The door into the bathroom creaked noisily at night. The internet connection, admittedly free, was painfully slow. Towards the end of our week's stay the toilet flush ceased to function.

However, the area around this hotel seemed to be a place people live. You can still walk to anywhere you want to go. I loved everything about the hotel. The garden, the rooms (beautifully furnished but not excessively lavish), the charming staff. There was a genuine attention to detail. I hope to go back, but if I don't, the stay here will remain in my memory as a highlight of our trip.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cMagical and unique. Easily one of the great hotels of the world.\u201d", "Author": "usasnob", "ReviewID": "UR77318874", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights at here in August, coming from a Chateau&Relais Hotel in Rome and going to a private villa in Tuscany afterwards. In Venice, I usually stay at the Gritti Palace or the Cipriani, but I was travelling with my ex-husband, our 10 and 14 year old children and my grown nephew, and decided to try something different, partially because of the hideous tourist hordes that plague Venice in the summer. I'm a hotel connossieur from way back, extremely demanding, and have stayed in some of the finest places in the world on pretty much every continent. I'm only half-willing to write this review because I actually don't want you to discover this stunning hotel. Easily the loveliest place we stayed on our trip. Exquisite environment that the pictures don't do justice to. Perfect location. Impeccable service. Imagine that you live in Venice, in a gorgeous, beautifully decorated private home, set in a miraculous swath of garden (the only grass we saw in Venice) and are attended by a group of unobtrusive but wildly attentive people who know all the best places to go and see and eat and quietly arrange everything for you. This comes close to our experience but barely scratches the surface of it. We had two of their suites. Beautifully furnished and decorated. One, on the ground floor, opened onto the garden and a tiny private terrace. The other, on the top floor was like a luxurious little rooftop garret from which we could look down onto the garden and the canal beyond. Lovely bathrooms. Entire place exquisitely clean. Bulgari toiletries. An honor bar in the lovely living room with high-end drinks. Breakfast (or drinks) in their garden is worth the trip to Venice alone. You don't think of Venice in summer as a \"peaceful\" place, but this certainly was. We were directed to lovely restaurants off the beaten path that we weren't previously familiar with. Though you are a 10+ minute walk from the tourist sites (only a few moments walk from the San Tomas traghetto stop which will take you anywhere quickly if you don't like walking) you are lightyears away from the throngs of people that jam the area around St. Marks and make you think Venice is only an Italian Disneyland, full of souvenir stands and people from back home. Stay here and you will see the real Venice, fall in love with the city and the people and never want to leave. You will be spoiled shamelessly for any other place here and will probably book your next Venice trip months in advance to make sure you can get one of the hotels 6 rooms. Words of warning: if you travel with teenage boys or young men, they WILL fall in love from afar with Rita who lays out breakfast in the garden, and their minds will fill with wild plans to return immediately to Venice if only to gain another glimpse of her and declare their feelings. Also, when you book, the hotel sends you a map of their exact location. Download this and make copies. One comes to Venice partially to get lost and wander, but this hotel is truly a hidden gem and without this map, the getting lost/wandering part could be prolonged. Now please forget everything you just read. Go stay in the Bauer or the Gritti or one of those crazy trendy modernist new places off the Grand Canal. Leave Oltre Il Giardino to those of us who don't want to feel like tourists but beloved guests.

Oltre Il Giardino is thankfully none of these and is more akin to your own little villa. We felt at home the moment we stepped through the door. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small, which is what we like, with only a handful of rooms, but so personable. The team are friendly and helpful but not intrusive and are happy to let you come and go as you wish (but always with a friendly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buon giorno\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buona notte\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Equally they will advise you on where to visit or eat if you want. We were celebrating our second wedding anniversary and had opted for a suite, which frankly was the same price as an average room in one of the larger hotels. We had the suite on the ground floor and although we were worried it might be noisy (you could sometimes hear people in the reception when sat in the lounge area of the suite), once you closed the large wooden doors to the bedroom there was silence. It was beautifully decorated in an old-and-new combination with a discreet LCD TV perched on a beautiful antique desk, a comfy modern sofa set next to a vintage wardrobe, 18th Century paintings and fresh flowers. The bathroom was definitely not vintage and you had a plentiful of nice towels and toiletries. There was a mini bar but, you could also order drinks from reception which were brought on a tray with delicious nibbles. For breakfast there was fresh fruit, cereals, yoghurts and the most delicious pastries and croissants. There was also cheese and meats available. Weather permitting you can take breakfast outside in the garden which is lovely. The location was spot on, in the centre of Venice, a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw from the Grand Canal and the major sights but, without the throngs of tourists that you find elsewhere. We felt as though we were staying where the locals hung out rather than in a major tourist area and walking back at night along the small canal was beautiful and so romantic. The Santa Maria dei Frari Church, which is just over the small canal, is definitely worth a visit. Close by is the Caff\u00c3\u00a9 Dei Frari, which is a place where the locals pop in after work for a glass of Prosecco and a tasty sandwich, and you really should join them. Also close by and worth going to is Birraria la Corte, which is a large pizzeria / restaurant that serves great food and again is a favourite of the locals. In Venice the best thing to do is go for a long walk and just get lost, although that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult since there are signs pointing to the Rialto and San Marco on every corner. You will stumble across some lovely squares, quirky shops and wonderful places to eat. Visit the Peggy Guggenheim Museum, which has some good modern art but, is also in a great location on the Grand Canal. For great views over the whole of Venice take a vaporetto from San Marco to San Giorgio and go up to the top of the bell tower of San Giorgio Maggiore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fantastic. As you can probably tell, we had a great time in Venice, despite the rain, and this was certainly aided by staying at the wonderful Oltre Il Giardino.

We stayed in the grey room on the top floor. It was a very romantic room, and a nice bathroom with Bulgari amenities. In the mornings, they serve breakfast outside in the garden. In terms of location, as soon as you go out of the front gate, it is right next to a small canal, and it is about a 5-10 min walk to the grand canal and the closest vaporetto (water bus) stop. The location was really great - about 10 min walk to Rialto and 10-15 min walk to the train and bus stations. The hotel is a stone's throw away from the Frari, which I probably would not have thought of visiting hadn't it been so close, but I would definitely recommend it for those who like art.

We are already planning a return visit for early next year. Oltre il Giardino is located on a small canal behind the Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari church, in a quiet location not overwhelmed by large groups of tourists but close to excellent restaurants and a short walk to the traghetto and the Rialto Bridge. (Better yet, because it is so close to the Frari, one of Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major churches, you never have to worry about not being able to find your way back!) Oltre il Giardino's owners and staff are extremely helpful and friendly, knowledgeable about Venice, and eager to help with suggestions and restaurant reservations. They are also gracious and thoughtful hosts. The building is beautifully renovated and maintained; the rooms are comfortable, luxurious, and large. When the weather is good, be sure to have breakfast in the garden, where you can eat delicious pastries and fruit and sip wonderful cappuccino while listening to the birds and the Frari bells. If you want to learn more about the art and history of Venice, I suggest you engage Howard Fitzpatrick, an American art historian who lives in Venice, for a private walking tour early during your stay at Oltre il Giardino. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take you to well-known places, as well as to places most tourists never see, while describing the art, architecture, and history of Venice.

We absolutely LOVED everything about this hotel -- I don't even feel it's accurate to call it a \"hotel\" - it's more like staying at a Venetian's home -- a really NICE, beautiful, private home. We stayed in the Green Suite, which is located on the bottom floor of Oltre Il Giardino - at first, we were concerned about noise of others coming in and going out of the property, but we didn't hear anything - except church bells and children playing at a school from nearby. As there are so few people staying at the hotel, and our suite was so spacious (with beautiful antique wooden doors separating the bedroom area from the sitting room), we slept incredibly well. We actually loved the extra privacy of being on the 1st floor by ourselves, and the Green Suite had its own private patio, which we enjoyed on the sunny days/evenings with a bottle of Italian wine. The Green Suite, I believe, is one of the most spacious of the rooms at Oltre Il Giardino - if you stay there, we highly recommend this room. It's a LOT of space for a european hotel - our hotel room in paris was about the size of the BATHROOM in our room at Oltre Il Giardino! It was all of the little touches which were really amazing about this place. On several evenings, we came back to find lit candles on the patio table, which was a really nice surprise. When we were out one evening, my husband had bought me two roses from a street vendor (a little touristy, yes, but we figured why not since it was our honeymoon!). That night, we put them in a vase in our room which held other flowers. When we came back to our room the following afternoon (after the room had been made up), we found the roses in their own separate vase. Little touches like this were unexpected, but really made this a very special place. On our last night at the hotel, we were chatting with the lovely gentleman (Manuele) who had the night shift. We were trading email addresses, and he also handed to us a long, detailed recipe of how to make homemade pizza (we had been speaking with him the night before about the differences between NYC and Italian pizza). It was the sweetest gesture, and indicative of how special a place Oltre Il Giardino really was. If you love boutique hotels, this is definitely the place for you. This isn't the Gritti Palace or the Bauer Hotel, but that's what we loved about it. Note - children are allowed to stay at the property, and there were families there during our visit, but the only times we ever saw anyone else was at breakfast (which was simple but very tasty - the pastries are fantastic). We highly recommend Oltre Il Giardino for anyone looking for a romantic and quiet get-away.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "west midlands", "Title": "\u201ccalm, cosy and stylish with great staff\u201d", "Author": "foofoo28", "ReviewID": "UR16721487", "Content": "my husband and i stayed at this property after scouring the reviews. my main motivation was the way it looked (and the positive reviews) and its location. the hotel we stayed in the grey room which was very calm and comfortable. the style was simple but elegant with a small mini fridge for convieniece. there was also a tv, which we never turned on and the facility to control the air conditioning. we overlooked the garden, as do all the rooms, and looked out on to residential buildings, which were typically italian style. you could also see the canal, with its very occasional traffic. we had lovely weather and sat out in the garden for breakfast which was lovely. the only reason i havn't rated this prpoerty excellent is that the garden while not at all unkept, could have done with the lawn maintained and cut. maybe i felt this beacuse my husband keeps our garden looking pretty good and is always in it- i think he secretly wanted to mow their lawn! breakfast was functional with the usual cereal, yogurts and croissants and pastrys - no hot food but we knew this beforehand and enjoyed what we had. the staff all the staff were fantastic -friendly and helpful. we asked for dinner recommendations and elanor gave us several, also with a very helpful map. we got in late one night and emanuelle made us feel so at home. the other gentleman on reception also booked us a water taxi back to the airport. location we specifically wanted to stay away from the touristy areas and we were so glad we did. the area in which the hotel was located was just a few minutes away from the canalside through a mainly residential area. it was so quiet and relaxed and we feel we would have really missed out if we had stayed nearer the main attractions. we explored alot on foot and came across may lovely streets and sqaures. we wouldnt hesitate to stay here again although some might find it too quiet - it was just perfect for us as we wanted a relaxing, friendly environment.", "Date": "June 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAs long as it's the best\u201d", "Author": "Trendyacademic", "ReviewID": "UR16718277", "Content": "This was my first visit to Venice and did a lot of research on where to stay.

The standard of service was exceptional, but friendly and welcoming. I was a solo traveller, pretty rare for Venetian accommodation, and they sussed that I wanted to be left to myself for a quiet break. They also gave me 10% off the final bill even though I was occupying one of their junior suites at double-room rates. The view from my room was unparalleled. I slept with the curtains on the far window open so I was woken by the sunlight and the view, and I often put down the fly screen and opened the window just to hear the birds and the bells. Yet when the windows were closed and the curtains shut, no sound or light would disturb you. The bathroom was flawless, the breakfast was amazing - not just the traditional ham, cheese and bread, but first-rate coffee and a wide selection of cereals, fresh fruits, and Venetian pastries. And the garden - wow - the star jasmine was out in all its glory, giving a gentle fragrance to everything. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.
