A nice perk was the free popcorn in the room! There was a microwave as well, which was a very nice amenity. They also served complimentary continental breakfast every morning. It was about a 15/20 minute walk to the shopping/restaurant district downtown & you can even clearly see the Space Needle from some of the rooms.

The king sized bed was comfortable and above all the room was spotless and from all appearances, the room had been recently renovated. Access to public transportation is a bit wanting but that will change as the Seattle LRT system is to be extended north.

I just returned home in mid-March from a three-night stay at this hotel, and would like to confirm the praises from previous reviewers. Everyone at the front desk was professional and helpful; you can tell they have a great team attitude, towards both the guests as well as one another. The staff is youthful and enthusiastic and you just feel good from the moment you walk in. I reserved a room with a king bed, microwave and refrigerator. I asked for a quiet room with a view and was delighted to be on the top floor with a great view of downtown Seattle. My room was spotless. The d\u00e9cor was comfortable, the room was spacious and the bathroom was recently remodeled, with nice tile and fixtures throughout. Towels are fluffy, linens are plush, and windows had blackout drapes plus nice sheers layered over them. It was a plus to have the refrigerator and microwave, because Whole Foods is just around the corner and I made a couple of grocery runs for late evening and early morning snacks. It appears the entire hotel is being upgraded, including the lobby, which they are in the process of remodeling and should be completed soon. This did not interfere with my comings and goings. In addition, if needed, there is a computer with a printer in the lobby to print your flight reservation or check emails. The location was perfect. I like to walk, and I was able to walk to the Space Needle, all throughout downtown and Pike Place Market several times during my stay. If you don\u2019t care to walk, you can catch the bus routes, which are very close to the hotel; just ask the staff where you would like to go.

We arrived at noon so our room wasn't ready for us yet which was to be expected considering check in wasn't till 3. We were able to park our car and went to get some lunch down at the Whole Foods a block away. The parking is free (major plus) but it is VERY limited so keep that in mind if you are arriving late. They were able to get our room ready a bit ahead of time, but we had a little trouble getting the key cards to work. At first we thought they just weren't coded properly as we kept getting a red light when we tried to get into the room. After two trips down to the lobby to get the keys reset, they sent a maintenance worker up to check out the door lock. He arrived within 5 minutes, and showed us how to insert the key card at a slightly upward angle and pull it out at just the right speed. I have never met a door lock so finicky before, but we were able to make it worked if we followed the instructions exactly. Too fast or too slow didnt work. The room was spacious and well decorated, with a big flat screen and a very comfortable bed. The shower was also very nice with a double shower head. We had plenty of space for the vanity counter and a good size desk, as well. The room had a terrific amount of space for a downtown hotel. The hotel is about 2-3 blocks from the heart of downtown, so we were able to walk into Pike Place Market in about 10-15 minutes. Very do-able even in the chilly January weather. The amount of money we saved by staying here instead of a downtown hotel was definitely worth the extra 2 block walk. It seemed like the area directly around the hotel had recently been updated, and there's a new street car line that runs down Westlake. Lots of new buildings and shops in the area as well, and it felt very safe even at night. We found the breakfast to be good and plenty for us. You could make waffles, and they had hardboiled eggs, yogurts, cereals, bagels, toast, etc. No scrambled eggs or meat or anything but a very reasonable selection for a hotel of this caliber and more than enough to get you started for the day.

One of the reasons we booked this hotel was because it offered free parking in a secure garage with surveillance cameras... but that turned out to be a total nightmare! On the second night of our stay, someone hit our rental car which was parked in the hotel's garage and left a huge dent. When we asked the front desk to see the footage from the surveillance cameras, we were told that the cameras only face the entrance, exit, and elevator, NOT THE CARS, so we were not able to identify the person who damaged our car. On the third night, we weren't even able to park in the garage because it was completely full (they have very limited parking spaces, a whole lot less than they have rooms), so the front desk told us to park on the street until 10PM then move to the garage that belonged to the restaurant across the street from the hotel. This ended up ruining our plans for the night since we wanted to leave our car at the hotel and take a cab downtown. In addition, on New Years Eve night people were throwing confetti canisters down from their balconies and hitting the cars parked in the handicap spaces below, right in front of the entrance to the hotel. They made loud thumping noises as they hit the cars and one of the canisters almost hit me. We told the front desk about it, and they said, \"Yeah, we know.

I am not equipped to make comparisons. That being said, I was traveling with my two sisters and our elderly mother. Mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to ambulate varies depending on the day and how much she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been on her feet. By the end of the day she is very unsteady and uses walking sticks. We brought along her handicap placard just for that reason and to make the trip as easy on her as possible. We popped back into the hotel one lunch time to regroup before heading back out. All of the handicap places in front were taken; one by the hotel manager (who is not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by the way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disabled). That was irritating but perhaps she just needed to grab something quick? At the end of the day when we returned, the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car was still parked in one of the two handicap places in front of the hotel. When I went in to inquire, Mirasol (a sweet, helpful receptionist) said that the car would be moved right away. We parked illegally in the street waiting. After a few more minutes my sister ran in to see when \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be. After quick discussion, Mirasol offered to move the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car for her; which she did; although we were advised we could park in the parking garage instead. After parking and getting Mom in the hotel, I asked to speak to the manager who was not at all apologetic, but a bit testy stating that there were no parking spaces when she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come to work at 7:00 a.m. Apparently, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d parked there for the entire day. By profession I am an advocate for elderly and disabled persons. This sat very poorly with me. While parking was indeed free, the spaces in the garage that we did use the next day were extremely narrow and judging by the marred walls, we were not the only ones challenged to pull in and out. The hotel rooms were nice; equipped with a microwave and fridge. Breakfast was okay. Best feature was that the Whole Foods store was only a block away and we food some very good eating bargains there. Our last night at the hotel we shared the hallway with very rowdy young men running back and forth from two rooms; yelling, letting the doors slam, etc. The evening manager had already warned them and warned them again after we called. They quieted until about 2:30 a.m. when they started up again. I do believe the staff would have had them removed had I called again, but I figured that would be an even noisier proposal so I just tried to sleep through it as best as possible.

Everything seemed to be in good working order. Didn't see anything in terms of cleanliness that grossed us out. Mini fridge and microwave was great. It was quiet. Check in/check out was a breeze. Great location - a couple blocks or so from the downtown core. The Not so Good: I am extremely allergic to feathers. So feather pillows and/or duvets will trigger an asthma attack. When we called down to get synthetic pillow sent up, they said they didn't have any? What?? Surely, it's not such an odd request for a hotel, is it? So I had to sleep on a folded up sweatshirt.

So not a huge deal (you get what you pay for). The kids seemed to enjoy making their waffles! Other than that, there was just some yogurt and fruit and cereal.

I jumped out of bed to answer it, dreading some kind of horrible urgent news, only it was a pleasant recording informing me that this is my wakeup call. But we had not requested one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What's going on?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd my husband's sleepy voice asked. And our two young children began to roll in their bed, and rubbing their eyes. So I dialed the front desk to find out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your wake up call service just called our room at six, except we didn't request this wakeup call!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I announced the complain in my most irritated quiet voice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153....I didn't do it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the voice on the other end said. What kind of answer is this?! I found out that the voice belongs to Aldrich. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, who did?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I had to go along. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153...let's see...the person before my shift...could be Cory,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Aldrich. This surprised me even more that his first reply. I had not expected Aldrich to actually produce a prime suspect for me. It is too early to keep this going. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Actually, I don't care if it is you or Cory, don't you think you should apologize to me?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I opted to suggest the most entry level customer service etiquette to Aldrich. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would you like to speak with my manager?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Aldrich asked me. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wondering why he didn't just issue me an apology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because you sound upset,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Aldrich dryly stated his reason. I declined Aldrich's invitation. Because I much rather go back to sleep. At 9AM, I decided to see if another hotel representative might like to apologize to me. Marisol was equally unapologetic, plus a tense and defensive face, minus the humor that Aldrich unwittingly indulged. The conversation with Marisol mostly consisted with a series of possible excuses to explain how none of this is anyone's fault. The most interesting excuse is that their wake up call system will sometimes just randomly call and wake guests up. Marisol assured me that it only happens about once every 3 months, plus the one time, when their phone system kept call this one room everyday for no reason. She said they are machines, so mistakes can happen with machines. Actually, by this point, I had my own suspect in mind. If it is intentional, it had to be the person that checked me in the previous day. I think her name is Yesenia. We wanted to check in early, and was told the room would be ready by 1:45PM. Well, we didn't check in until a little after 3PM. Yesenia reminds me of someone who has been in the service industry for too long, and is so jaded, that she harbors a disdain for anyone walking around with luggages. She was unfriendly and rude. As I finally got my room card key, I couldn't hold it in anymore, and I told her that she could be nicer. Later that evening, my husband picked up the phone and called the front desk, and requested a 9AM wake up call. We did this just to avoid another potential 6AM call. Their menacing wake up call rang our room again at 6AM! I kid you not! FURIOUS!! MAD!! I dialed the front desk again. Somehow my furor toned down a bit when I heard Aldrich's voice on the other end again. He needed to be dealt in a different way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Aldrich, Cory woke us up again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I informed Aldrich. At least this time, he came up with a slightly more appropriate response. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OH NO!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Aldrich. I asked Aldrich to tell his hotel management about this and went back to bed. Later that day, we left at 11AM, and came back to our room a little after 5PM. Our room had not been cleaned. So we called the front desk to request our room cleaned and for new towels. They told us that housekeeping has left for the day. We were excited that we were leaving this hotel the next day at 5:30AM for an early morning flight. If you are someone who like to pay $185 a night (tax included) for a small and outdated room, managed by 3rd world country motel operators, then this place is a special heaven for you.

My husband and I stayed two nights pre-cruise. We stayed on the third floor in a corner room with one queen bed. The room had a balcony and a pretty good view of the Space Needle. It was actually a pretty large room. There was a separate sink in the dressing area with a large mirror and then another sink in small bathroom with the toilet and bath tub. The breakfast was fine, with Belgian Waffles, toast, cereal, biscuits, gravy, fruit, and yogurt. The location was about a ten to fifteen minute walk to the Space Needle and probably a 20 minute walk to Pike Market. IThe La Quintat is located a few blocks from the Light Rail Westlake Station, which takes you to Sea-Tac airport for $2.50 in about 30 minutes. As has been mentioned before, there is a Whole Foods market a couple of blocks away as well as a wonderful pizza place (Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzaria) that is located in the shopping area upstairs from the Whole Foods by the Pan Pacific Hotel. The hotel front staff was very nice and held our luggage for us while we did some last minute sight-seeing before leaving for the cruise terminal. We had the front desk staff call for a Town Car to take us to Pier 91 (where Holland America docks). It was about a 15 minute drive and cost $20 before tip. I was pleased with our stay there for the two nights. We didn't have a car with us, but they do have free parking and free wireless internet.

But this one has a good downtown location. It's possible to walk to many places of interest from the hotel. One of the biggest bonuses is free parking. Every other hotel I checked had at least a $35 a day parking fee. Another bonus is the very friendly and helpful staff. They even gave our pup a treat bag. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which had a nice view of downtown and the Space Needle. The living room area was spacious but the bedroom was small. This was not a problem because of the spaciousness of the other room plus there was a pretty decent closet. The largest negative to this suite is that there is no air conditioning unit in the bedroom-there is just a small fan on the dresser--the only a/c unit is in the living room. It wasn't a big problem for us because the weather was not too hot, but in hot weather this could be a problem. The bathroom was small and could use some updating--the tub floor had a crack in it. But everything was very clean and the bed linens and towels were fine. There was a little bar area in the hallway with a sink, microwave and coffee maker.

First, the elevators are slow. We quit waiting for them and just used the stairs. Also, the free parking was tight as the hotel seemed full. We had to really squeeze into some spots. However, I don't blame the hotel, but other patrons who didn't know how to park between the lines. They would instead take two stalls to park. Also, the hotel is old and appears to be a purchased property that was converted into La Quinta. But I feel that they have done a great job of remodeling the building to make it very pleasant considering the age of the building. Another great thing is the business/internet center where you could use the internet and print for free. Most of the \"upscale\" hotels charge for this service, yet La Quinta allows it for free.

There were some hairs on the bathroom floor, and they weren't mine. Air conditioning: worked okay, there were 2 speeds. The windows don't open. We didn't have a balcony but that might be something to ask for. Breakfast: pastries, muffins, yogurt, make your own waffles- it was great to have a good breakfast each morning to start the day. Parking: 10 spots above ground, the rest is underground and around the back through an alley. It was tight but we have a truck with a canopy and we managed to get a space everytime. We saw SUV's parked underground, and even a Hummer (taking up 2 spots, grrr). You do need some good parking skills though. Location: Great! We walked everywhere. The area is not the nicest, with parking lots and some construction around, but we were never afraid. If you want to pay more you can stay more in the heart of downtown.

The free breakfast was fair but typical: toast and muffins, make your own waffles, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, terrible coffee, apples and bananas. In a 5 or 10 minute walk there is an excellent Thai restaurant called Golden Singha and a good pizza place called Zekes. They opened another pizza place there called Bambinos which looked like realy NY pizza but we didn't have time to try it. The Hurricane cafe behind the 8th Avenue Inn used to be good but it's gone downhill in quality so best to avoid it unless you are hungry really late and nothing else is open. There is a computer with printer off the lobby with internet access (free) and free wifi in the rooms. There is a jacuzzi which looked nice but we didn't have time to use. I come to Seatlle at least once a year and I'll definately stay here again.", "Date": "October 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albuquerque", "Title": "\u201cHotel was great!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5459701", "Content": "Hotel reasonably priced and located near downtown, with easy walking distance to Space Needle and not that far to Pike Place Market. [Little longer walk, but possible]. Room was spacious and clean. Had refrigerator, microwave. Staff very helpful and friendly, got us transportation to airport, restaurant, for example. Sent me back my phone charger, which I left behind, at no charge. Neighborhood so so, but never felt threatened, even at night. Decent continental breakfast provided, including self-made waffles. All in all, the hotel was very nice, especially for the price, we would stay there again.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Quinta Inn & Suites Seattle Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d217807-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_Seattle_Downtown-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$136 - $289*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2224 8th Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98121</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "217807", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/16/b2/16b2dcc164aeed0d8e037e4b763286f29large.jpg"}}
