{"Reviews": [{"Content": "If you something forgot in hotel they will give you back for sure!! Hotel Jaguar is great located hotel in the centre of Frankfurt. It's very cheap, quiet, with very friendly staff. I had very suprising experience with them, because i left some things in a hotel after coming home and their great staff send me back my things by post! So honest people you can't find everywhere, so you can be shure that this hotel is really great and you can feel like you are home!", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR623212997", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sound11"}, {"Content": "Unexeptable behaviour We are from Greece and we have made a reservation for hotel Jaguar 1 month before our trip to Frankfurt. We arrived to the hotel and we were told that the credit card with which we have made the reservation was not valid and that because of this there was no room available for us!! In our question why haven't they informed us earlier with a mail about the problem they answered that they have seen our mail just yesterday!! But when we have booked we were sent a confirmation that everything was ok with our reservation!! The owner told us to come back 4 hours later (we were already very tired from our trip and we were obliged to scroll around the town because of their unexeptable mistake). Notice this, that we could not have at any case one double bed but two separate.. The worst was that when we furiously took our baggages and we were ready to go because we did not wanted to wait and we felt so ashamed of this behaviour the owner immediately changed behaviour and very polite told us to stay and we would have a room right away!!! I think that this was the worst travel experience I have ever had, me and my boyfriend too. And I feel sorry that we were so polite with them, they need a strong lesson so that they can respect the traveller. We had after this to search with our luggages for another hotel, it was so awfull.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL! And I have to say that we managed to find a very good hotel after all this, Hotel Luxus at Hanauer Strasse, with very polite people, a much better price than Jaguar, fortunately.. I recommend Hotel Luxus to everyone oing to Frankfurt.", "Date": "Jan 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR893299752", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "annmar80"}, {"Content": "Exactly what is does on the tin This is a budget hotel located in Frankfurt Germany. It does exactly what is says on the tin, clean, very cheap, friendly staff, great location for city transport links.

This place holds the prestigious ranking as one of the top three worst hotels I've ever experienced. I can't stress enough that you should avoid it at all costs. Bed coverings full of hair, cracked paint and holes in walls, extremely rude staff (the male evening worker who we believe was the owner posing as just an employee to act as though he didn't have decision making power - the morning female worker was rather sweet), and just altogether awful. Despite the three twin sized beds in our room (even though we booked for one room with a double bed), my husband and I shared one twin bed because we didn't have the energy to 'clean' the others. Instead, we slept fully clothed on top of the cover sheet, with no blanket (because it was too dirty), and towels across the top of the bed to lay our head on. Absolutely disgusting.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR572314921", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "iamatraveler"}, {"Content": "More Like A Hostel, Cheap  Arrived in Frankfurt for the last day of our World Cup tour 2006 with nowhere booked. Tourist info office in the train station found this for us (three of us needed a room). Triple room cost us EUR85 including breakfast. They'll try  upgrade the breakfast (another EUR10 each) when you arrive  if you don't agree they'll ensure you only have coffee, bread, butter  jam, they're quite strict about it  told us they'd be watching! In the end we never made it down for breakfast anyway so can't comment further.To be honest I wouldn't mess with the staff, they're quite firm, not the friendliest bunch but the place served a purpose, was cheap, fairly clean  quite central. It's right by the zoo so there are always cabs at the top of the road  it's really only a 10 minte walk into the central area anyway.One thing, we paid by cash  the next day, the same bloke who'd taken the money asked to see the receipt which we'd stupidly lost  was trying it on to get us to pay again. Keep your receipt if you pay by cash! I wouldn't recommend this place for a long stay but if you're on a budget I doubt you'll find much cheaper this central. Did seem more like a hostel though!", "Date": "Jul 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR931077010", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "thejudderman"}, {"Content": "Absolut nicht empfehlenswert   showReview(22556266, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR369561927", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "golle99"}, {"Content": "Die 3 Sterne in 3 Zitronen wandeln!
