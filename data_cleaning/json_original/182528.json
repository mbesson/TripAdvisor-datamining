With that said, you would imagine that it may be outdated, despite being one of the marquee hotels in the downtown core. Staying there two times in January, the hotel and service did not dissappoint and was pleasantly surprised with the updated rooms! Clean and comfortable, it had everything a 4/5 star hotel could offer. Location for Vancouver could not get better. Walking distance to the convention centre, great restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. We booked two rooms (king bed suite, and a 2 queen suite) which was adjoined with a \"living room\" space. All together it felt like a large living quarter (minus a kitchen) that provided more than enough sleeping arrangements, bathrooms, TV's and mini fridge for our party. I also was able to spend some time in the presidential suite - which was uber modern, with luxurious finishes (marble granite), decor (loungers, couches, eating area, living room area, fireplace), with a beautiful bedroom (plush king bed), full size tub, closets and bathroom - perfect for a special stay, or honeymoon suite. Came equipped with a desk for office work, kitchen, and wine cooler (which may have been an add-on).

The hotel has recently implemented a new elevator system. Elevators are numbered from A-F. When you arrive at the elevators you hit the # of the floor you want to go to. The screen then prompts you to line up in front of your letter. Once you are in your elevator you cannot hit any buttons, get out at any other floor than originally chosen. Over the 3 days I spent at the hotel, there was not a time i waited less than 15 minutes to get up or down. On the Saturday night we had tickets to a concert and dinner reservations. It took me 35 minutes to get to the lobby, where at this point we were way passed our dinner reservation & our table was given away. I asked the concierge \"what is wrong with the elevators\" and she snapped back at me that nothing was wrong & it was just a busy weekend at the hotel. I'm sorry, but I've stayed at plenty of hotels when they are running at capacity & that has never happened. Towards the end it got so crazy if i saw someone getting into another elevator that was going less than 10 floors above or below mine i would jump in it and then walk up or down that many flights of stairs. Luckily I am 26 and i am physically able to do that. I complained again the last day after going to use the gym & waiting 20 minutes to get back to my room. the concierge offered me 50% off my parking. Not really what i would expect, but oh well, i was just ready to get out of there! When i checked out somehow i had almost $250 in parking charges. I was really confused, so was they guy at the front desk. After it took me 20 minutes to get down stairs to check out, it took him another 20 to figure out what was wrong with my bill. He also mentioned he was hungover & math wasn't his strong suit on Sunday's... nice buddy. After him making no sense i eventually had to use his calculator, add up the charges for my stay and what my parking should have been & then show him how to subtract that from the total. Overall, terrible experience. I will NEVER be back to this Hyatt again. If you are staying in Vancouver there are so many wonderful small hotels. L'Hermitage, the Loden, Hotel Georgia. Stay away from the Hyatt. It is a nightmare! It's unfortunate too, because their rooms are not bad, neither was the room service or gym.

Check in was easy and the reception staff member was quick to make sure all the details and requirements were met. The whole check in took approximately 6 minutes including the same staff member walking me to the elevator to show how they operated as it was my first time at this hotel. If this is standard for the front desk staff then well done. The Regency Club floor is snug and located at the end of the 29th floor but though smaller than most this room is enhanced by the concierge on the the Raine ( spelling? ) who makes everyone feel comfortable and is intuitive enough to meet client's requirements without being overbearing. This itself is a hard thing to master but she seems to have is a tremendous asset to the hotel. My room ( 2910 ) was what I would have expected from Hyatt Regency but I did note that complimentary water is not available in the room. This was something that I missed and after being in SE Asian and Oceanic hotels of this chain I expected similar service here. This is the only fault I had with the room. The hotel is located conveniently to down town with shopping nearby and the subway close by as well. The restaurant downstairs does suffer a little from noise creep from other areas especially if there is a loud convention/conference on the second floor. I have to say the staff are quick, willing and knowledgable of their fare though the menu was a little sparse there was a fair variety available with a natural balance towards fish.

I had called ahead to find out what the price of parking was, bracing myself for the expense and was told by the front desk that it would be $38 a day. When we arrived, we spoke to the valet and he advised us that if we do not need to come and go, and if we were just leaving the car parked, then the cheaper option is to just take the ticket form the machine and save ourselves $20 and to just leave the front desk out of it all together.

Location was great, with a good choice of nearby restaurants, and also to the waterside. We ate in a great restaurant nearby called Coast - surf and turf place, The restaurant bar also looked good, but we didn't sample the cocktails, as we were pretty tired after our 10hr flight. The hotel breakfast was great, a good choice and reasonably priced. We had wanted to eat out for breakfast, but other than McDonalds there weren't any breakfast type places open nearby that we could find. The hotel allowed us to check out a bit later (1.30pm) for no extra charge, which enabled us to see a bit of Vancouver and take a walk along the water to Stanley Park, before we had to get on the snowbus.

Beds, fixtures, towels and linens were top-notch, HVAC was responsive, and the wi-fi Internet ($10 per day) was robust. (Points off, though, for the too-small flat-screen TV mounted a long way from the beds... and the silly ceiling-mounted shower head, intended as a luxury touch but merely a complicating factor. Also, road noise and commotion in adjacent rooms are both audible, but only minor annoyances.) You're steps from Robson and Alberni, with shops and restaurants galore, and the Burrard Street SkyTrain station is right next door. The Cactus Club Cafe across the street serves well past midnight and there's a 24-hour Tim Horton's next door, both excellent in their respective ways. Underground parking is $23 per 24 hours, not so bad by in-city standards, in a shared-access parkade that also serves an attached shopping center.

Every employee we met, from the check-in desk to the chambermaid to the bar waiter to the managers, was \"on\" -- welcoming, helpful, happy to see us -- even those stuck working Christmas Eve seemed pleased to be part of the show. On that basis alone I'd call this one of the best Hyatt Regency properties in North America. The excellent (though decidedly special, off-season) rate we paid, around US$120 per night, was just the icing on the cake. It's a happy operation that copes effortlessly with businesspeople and tourists alike, and it's definitely earned a spot atop our must-go-back list.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, Good Price\u201d", "Author": "6starluxurytraveler", "ReviewID": "UR122204834", "Content": "The check-in in the lobby was smooth. We stayed in a very spacious Executive Suite, room 3308 which was approximately 180sqm. The suite consisted of a guest powder room, a living room, a dinning room with 8 chairs, a pantry area next to the dinning area with coffee machine and microwave, a second more cosier living room with a large bathroom with separate tub and shower and double sinks as well as a spacious bedroom with a large bathroom with separate tub and shower. There were views of bustling Burrad and Georgia Street intersection. To our disappointment there was no fruit basket in our room, no milk or cups to accompany the coffee machine, no tea bags, no minibar and no plates for the microwave. There was also very limited closet space in the accommodation. The Regency Club Lounge was not very fancy, it wasn't very big and the area in which the food was presented was minisculus, they offered a limited selection of food at breakfast which was mostly cold cut, at cocktail hours there was a small selection of snacks you could have, they charged CAD$8 for a glass of wine. This was acceptable as we only paid CAD$29 extra per night to have club access. The cuisine in the Mosaic Grille is of the highest quality, the scallops are cooked wonderfully as well as the meat and fish, a dinner for two persons with half a bottle of wine would cost approximately CAD$140. The location of the hotel is very good, there is Starbucks in the lobby and a large convenience store is located in the connecting shopping mall, the Vancouver Art gallery is only a 5 minute walk and Sears is close by. All in all it was an affordable stay as we only paid CAD$299 per night during our four night stay for a 180sqm suite in the heart of the city, the normal rate for this suite is CAD$699, I recommend if you have a Hyatt Gold Passport to use the affordable upgrades they provide.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cSolid Bang for your Buck - Excellent location, room size, decor and service\u201d", "Author": "AKCToronto", "ReviewID": "UR121993263", "Content": "We just returned from a 5 night (6 day) stay at Hilton and I was pleasantly surprised by our stay. I booked on hotels.com and the price was quite fair (~$118 for Sun-Wed and ~$129 for Fri/Sat). For a 4 star hotel, you'll get good value for your dollar (reminder, this is not a 5 star, this is not Shangri-la; this review is based on what you get for a 4 star hotel). Rooms: The rooms are refurbished and very contemporary and spacious (well at the least the king size room we had was spacious) and equipped with an Ipod docking station (in the case you forget to bring your iPhone charger - not necessary to bring it), with a desk, bench, arm chair, etc. The bed and pillows are super comfortable. Bathroom: The amenities are limited (was expecting that due to the reviews) but if you call them they will supply the cotton balls, q-tips and anything else. There is a rain shower head with inner and outer bathmats and lots of space on the vanity for toiletries. Although the bathroom is a dark slate color, it appeared very clean as the sink, toilet and tub are in pristine condition. Service: The room is regularly cleaned and serviced on a daily basis and towels are replenished. The concierge is helpful for taxi fare, tours and restaurant locations, etc. The gym on the fourth floor is closed but you can access a temporary gym on the 29th floor, which has treadmills, elipticals, stability ball, etc. (Just didn't see any free weights). There are towels, water and a coffee machine located inside. There are television monitors on the treadmill and they supply headphones. Location: Can't be beat for access to Sky train, shops, Stanley Park, etc.! The Burrard (spelling?) station is located across the street - you can take the Canada line sky train from the airport (with one transfer change on the way) for $7.50 per person. It does get noisy at night due to the downtown vibe but overall we slept well (our room on the 23rd floor overlooked Burrard and Fairmont Vancouver). Maybe you can get a room that is located opposite from the downtown city streets and it may be more quieter. I liked that the spa I booked (at Fairmont's Absolute) was within walking distance (~3 minutes away) and you can shop/browse at Louis Vuitton, also located across the street. The Pacific mall is also within walking distance. Here is the best part: Starbucks and Tim Horton's located right under your feet - literally. The Starbucks is in the lobby and there is a mall attached to the Hyatt where you can access Tim Horton's, Micky D's, Rexall pharmacy, Staples and another Starbucks and other stores - in case you don't want to venture outside. CONS: Internet charge; $9.95/day for light; $14.95/day for full service; $69.95 for one week. I think this hotel appeals to business travellers - what's with the internet charges? That is a major turn-off and needs to also be factored into the room charge when clients are comparing staying at other hotels in the same category.

As some say, not much character or uniqueness here, but I'm not looking for the hotel to provide me that given the proximity to great restaurants and parks here. The only negative I would say is driving in and parking. We arrived around 7:00 pm and the traffic was fairly bad, particularly foot traffic, and we sat trying to get in while pedestrians continually - and literally - rushed to get in front of our car. Door and bellman just sat and watched - would be good if they actually monitored traffic for a bit. The parking also is very expensive. Self-park would be the first order of rule, and second is consider that from 6pm to 6am the parkade is only $8, compared with 36 for selfpark with the hotel and 48 for valet.

The location is excellent, we took the train all the way from the airport and only had to walk three blocks with our luggage in order to get to the hotel. We rarely took cabs during our stay as we could walk to most of our destinations (and when we did take a cab it wasn't very expensive). There was a large gingerbread display in the lobby which was nice and got us in the Christmas spirit, and also a Starbucks (very convenient). This also meant the lobby was usually quite busy (not an issue for us but it may be for others). There is also a 24-7 McDonalds and a Tim Hortons near by for late night snacks. We didn't try any of the food at the hotel but from what I saw on the room service menu it was a bit on the pricey side - but perhaps it's delicious and worth the cost! The rooms were clean and modern. The bed was very plush and comfortable. We had everything we needed (abundant towels, coffee, tea, a mini-fridge, etc.) - except complimentary water bottles would have been a nice add-on. As with most of the other reviewers, I'd have to say one of the biggest drawbacks of this hotel was the daily charge for internet use. It was cheaper for us to use the data plans on our cell phones. We also had some issues with how sound-proof the hotel was. We could hear our neighbour's tvs (on both sides) whenever they were on - even if it wasn't very loud. There was contruction going on (I think above us?) for a few hours one morning - we woke up to what sounded like drilling. The street traffic was also a bit loud - we were east facing on the 12th floor. But I was most surprised when on our last night we were able to hear a guest in a room nearby snoring! I definitly expected thicker walls then that... my boyfriend said wearing earplugs is a quick fix for this problem but I don't feel that guests should have to wear them all the time. I'm not sure if we would stay here again. I think it might be worth checking out some other hotels in a similar price range to see if any offer free internet and have thicker walls.

She checked my key to make sure it was indeed my room and I appreciated her caution. There are numerous restaurants in easy walking distance and a lot of high end shopping. There is a McDonalds and Tim Horten's right there, for quick and cheap stuff. W had a drink in the Mirage bar one night and the bartender was very helpful and forthcoming with restaurant suggestions and shopping tips.

Good TV and the iPod dock/alarm was very useful, though I'll say nothing about Canadian TV as that's not the hotel's fault! The shower was (as in so many hotels) a bit hit and miss. You had to get the temperature setting just right, and the fact that the shower head came from the ceiling with very little movement, meant that you could hardly avoid the water while trying to get the temperature right. Staff were helpful and friendly (especially the concierge), and the hotel felt clean and cool. There's a Starbucks in the lobby with free wifi (once you get the password) so that's a real bonus - you don't have to pay for the hotel's wifi service which only gives you one computer or smartphone access for the price. 2 x smartphones? 2 x fees!

We are fussy about cleanliness and air quality and noise and all that, but we also really hate to spend huge amounts of money for a bed and bathtub. After a fair amount of research, we decided that you might as well go for the good stuff in Vancouver. Staying outside of the city center seemed to offer no significant price advantages. The Hyatt is steps away from Robson Street, which pleased my wife. We had an interesting choice of restaurants within walking distance. The room was pristine. Crisp white linens, shiny bathroom, little refrigerator, newish TV, great view and real glass glasses for our nightcap. The noise level (bathroom fan and air conditioner) was very good. The parking was weird. According to the sign in the front of the hotel, Valet Parking would be $48.00 and self-parking would be $38.00. For $10 for ten minutes I thought I would do it myself. Because of some confusion when entering the garage, I wound up talking to the attendant. By paying my own, and not using the hotel system, I paid $27.00. (So self-parking saved me $21.00.) My one major complaint is that that the internet cost almost $17.00. Sorry, I think internet should be like electricity and running water. What was worse, however, is that pay system doesn't not deal with two devices. If my wife accessed the internet on her iPad, I had to reconnect on my computer, and vice-versa. I would say that through twelve hours I logged on at least fifty times. On check-out, I complained, both about paying and about the problem of having two devices. She said that next time, we should pay separately for both devices (so that each one has its own connection) and that they would refund the cost of the second one on check-out. Don't take my word for it, though. Arrange that when you check in. We will go back.

For conferences or other events at Canada Place, it's a more economic option than the ultra-high-end hotels on the waterfront, but the Hyatt doesn't skimp on amenities or comfort. Read on for more: LOCATION: Located near the corner of Georgia and Burrard Streets, about 4 blocks south of the Convention Center and Coal Harbor waterfront, the Hyatt is within easy walking distance of many key locations in downtown Vancouver. It's about a $35 taxi ride (depending on traffic) from Vancouver Int'l Airport, or about a 7-minute (3 block) walk from the Canada Line - City Center Station, for those who can use the airport train. The hotel is steps from the Vancouver Art Gallery and several theaters, and quite walkable to local shopping districts and Chinatown. For athletic types, it's within about a 20-30 minute walk from the key attractions in Stanley Park. PROPERTY: The hotel is a fairly typical high-rise business hotel in the downtown area. The lobby area is large and well-organized, including self-service check-in kiosks along with the manned desks. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, as well as a hotel bar open in the evenings. The hotel has a conference/meeting center on the first floor as well. Just across the driveway is a 24-hour Tim Horton's location, along with a McDonalds, for those who need a desperate late-night bite... Valet and self-park are available on-site, but prices were somewhat exorbitant -- if you're driving to Vancouver, you may want to consider stashing your car outside of town and riding the train in! There is wireless Internet available in the guest rooms, but no public WiFi in the lobby except the Starbucks network for coffee buyers, or the Hyatt Meeting channel that is password-protected for meeting clients. ROOMS: The rooms are about half-way between classic comfortable and ultra-contemporary. The work spaces, large comfy beds and plush room chair were all comfortable and immaculately clean. There was an in-room refrigerator available, along with a bar-service area, though (if it ever had one) in-room minibar items are no longer provided. The closet was spacious, and there were two luggage stands available in the room. Both wired and wireless Internet were available, and quite fast, though they come at a per-day or per-week charge, which is not inexpensive. (Platinum members get complimentary Internet.) The one negative part about the room was the bathroom. While there was plenty of water pressure, even on our high floor, the shower is just strange. Rather than a traditional shower head, there is a _slightly_-adjustable metal square set into the ceiling above the bathtub. About a dozen holes staggered in the plate make up the shower. In addition to being a rather poor shower to begin with, the central location above the tub, and the almost-nonexistent adjustability, made showering a bit of a challenge... Whether you want to wash your hair or not, it's going to get wet, and getting soap out of those... *ahem*... \"hard to reach places\" is harder than it ought to be, since the shower head is directly above you, shooting basically straight-downward. Thumbs-up on the room, the view, and the cleanliness. Thumbs-down on taking \"contemporary design\" to the point where form destroys function... AMENITIES: The hotel has an excellent concierge available in the lobby. There is a fitness center, with reasonably modern equipment, available for guests and open 24-hours. A well-rated restaurant (we didn't eat there) is on the second floor, along with the lounge/bar and Starbucks in the lobby. Room service is available. Internet, as mentioned, was fast and reliable, though you have to be in rooms or one of the other public areas outside of the lobby -- in the lobby, buy a coffee from Starbucks to get Internet access. STAFF: The staff we encountered was very friendly, and very helpful. Check-in and Check-out were seamless. Concierge service was very knowledgeable and helpful. Bell service handled our bags quickly and with care. Housekeeping did a great job of keeping the room in top-shape -- though, I will note, that the \"Privacy\" door hanger is an essential if you plan to sleep in past 8 AM, since that's when housekeeping starts knocking... Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay at the Hyatt. The staff made us feel welcome, and the rooms were top-notch. For the price, it was every bit as good a stay as the more pricey Pan Pacific or Fairmont hotels on the waterfront. If you're attending a conference, or plan to spend most of your time in the downtown business district, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better option for the price, than the Hyatt. Giving it 4-dots for an excellent stay, but less-than-excellent in-room bathroom and a few annoyances such as the lack of Internet in the lobby, and no serious airport shuttle options other than taxi or a walk to the train.

Our final night was the worst. We were playing music at the end of the evening, perhaps it was a little bit too loud. After a short while we received a phone call but were unable to answer in time. Several moments later, two male staff entered our room and said we needed to turn the music down. We were flabbergasted. Neither of us even heard a knock. Keep in mind our music was playing on the i-doc provided so it could only be so loud. Several friends of mine in the hotel industry have informed me that hotel staff aren't permitted to just enter your room unannounced and it is in fact against the law.

It is close to both the waterfront as well as many major sights in the downtown core. For art lovers, the Vancouver Art Gallery is just steps away. It is an easy walk to Robson Street, Gastown, Access by Skytrain from the Airport is very convenient. Vancouver City Centre Station is the closest stop but Waterfront Station is not too far either. This hotel met my expectations, but did not exceed them. It has all the amenities expected of a hotel of its class but you would not want anything less for the rate charged. The rooms are well appointed, clean and comfortable. As with many higher end business hotels, there is an exorbitant charge for Internet access. I attended a conference here so I spent several solid days in the hotel. The conference facilities were very good and the food was excellent, which is more than I can say for most hotel conference food that I have experienced elsewhere! Conference catering staff were not exceptionally friendly and were almost curt during the end of breakfast service when conference attendees almost had to hunt down cutlery and coffee. However, other meal service times were smooth. My one gripe was the front desk staff's blatant attempts to upsell conference guests to superior (read: more expensive) rooms. I discovered later that this upselling was inconsistent. Some guests were automatically upgraded while others paid differing charges for rooms higher up with a supposed view. I was suckered into upgrading as I was told that one of the superior rooms was available when I arrived for early check-in whereas other guests were simply given a free room. The upside is that after learning of these inconsistencies and calling the front desk to complain, the charges for most nights were reversed. I think it all depends on who is serving you, which goes against the consistency in service that Hyatt tries to put forward.

The common symptoms are aching joints, severe muscle pain and being hyper sensitive to pressure points. That means I have to stay at hotels that have either memory foam mattresses or memory foam or foam mattress toppers. Even a luxurious pillow top mattress can be painful if it is button tufted with many convolutions. We were heading to Vancouver for our 25th wedding anniversary and wanted to stay somewhere nice downtown. I liked what I read on tripadvisor. I wrote the hotel about my health problem and had a phone call from the assistant manager of housekeeping within a few hours of my email. They were able to find me a feather bed and would have the bed made up for me before our arrival. Feedback: The hotel is located extremely close to a main subway line which made it very convenient for taking the subway directly from the airport to his hotel. We never had to rent a car or pay for parking which can be quite expensive for downtown Vancouver. The central location was great for transit, shopping and sight seeing. We managed to get a great AAA/AMA rate which included an excellent quality full buffet breakfast (including made to order omelets) on a daily basis and the best muffins in the city. The room was extremely clean and had been renovated to a clean, urban look but definitely was not luxurious like 5 star hotels we usually stay at. The lighting was excellent for reading. We had a connecting door with neighbors but did not hear any noise whatsoever on our four day stay. The housekeeping staff were extremely attentive to see that my stay was comfortable with the feather bed - every staff member we encountered on our stay were extremely accommodating. We had asked for an upgrade to a high room with a view and balcony but were only able to get a room with a balcony as we were told that the higher floors only have king sized beds (we needed two doubles). We were charged an extra $20 a day for a balcony on the 9th floor but never ended up using it - because there really was no view to speak of - just office buildings in all directions.The pool and jacuzzi were very basic and the gym quite adequate. The bathtub is built for the shower and definitely not for soaking. My husband said his bed was quite comfortable but it had a common problem that most hotels do that haven't replaced their beds for awhile - after guests keep sleeping on the same side of the bed over and over - the bed starts to slope to one side. This made my feather bed kind of a moot point - I was sleeping at an angle which meant my body was fighting gravity all night and therefore I would wake up in pain everyday. Housekeeping did all that they could to rectify this for me but it just didn't work out. I think that the average person who doesn't have a health issue like mine would probably have found the beds quite suitable for their needs. We did not want to pay the extra $15 a day for wireless internet - thinking we could just use the business office for our computer needs but found that they were also charging for the use of the business office unlike most hotels that we stay at. My husband and I have always traveled for a hobby for the last 25 years and have stayed in hundreds of hotels across Canada, the US and Europe. We would say that this hotel meets your basic needs. If you want more luxury - you are going to pay quite a lot more for it in Vancouver.

I highly recommend taking the train. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was greeted by the doorman who directed me to the front desk. Check in was quick and informative. The person checking me in even walked me to the elevator and pushed the button. This is the first time experiencing this. Elevators are quick so the wait is never long. Upon reaching my floor, I made my way to my room passing a room attendant who greeted me with a smile. After entering the room, there was a knock at the door from the room attendant asking if everything was ok in my room, which it was. The room was very up to date, extremely clean and a pleasure to stay in. Each day, my room was clean to a very high standard. The gym and pool area in the hotel is on par with many of the hotel gyms that I have used during my travels. I ate at a couple of different restaurants in the hotel and the food was very good and served quickly. All the staff that I encountered during my stay were very professional and pleasant to deal with. They are more than happy to assist you and provide you with local knowledge, even where was the safest place to go for a run at 4 in the morning. (My body was still on east coast time). I would highly recommend staying at this hotel and it certainly deserves a 5 star rating.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cSuperb - Location, Price, Service\u201d", "Author": "jovita_a", "ReviewID": "UR112133620", "Content": "The Hotel is located within walking distances of every place in downtown Vancouver - Robson Street, Gas Town, Art Gallery, Cathedral, Train Station etc..., The staff is very polite, well trained, and prompt at their services.

The breakfast options are amazing theres a Tim Hortons and Mc Donalds right besides the hotel open 24 hours to grab a quick bite. There is an express check out facility which is excellent just tick the forms and leave it with the Reception Staff and your Credit Card is debited for the payment, its real quick and easy. I personally like this hotel because it has a tourist bus stop right behind the hotel, this stop is largely used by all tour companies like The Big Bus company, The Trolley company, Land and Sea Tours, Free Shuttles to Capilano, Grouse Mountain etc..., thus making it extremely easy to roam around the city and visit tourist attractions.

I liked it a lot because it seemed like I could get away from the chaos that seemed to be occurring at the other convention hotels where events were going on, yet was accessible to everywhere I needed to go. It was easy to get a taxi and/or walk about four blocks to the convention center, and I felt safe doing either. After experiencing the crowds of people in the lobby of some of the other hotels where functions were going on, it was refreshing to come back to a calmer environment. The hotel was clean, room was nice, and the staff was always ready and willing to please. All seemed to go out of their way to make sure everyone at the convention enjoyed their stay. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, and a restaurant upstairs that offered buffet breakfasts on the days I was there. The hotel is attached to a smaller mall, that includes a spa and a food court. The LifeSpa spa services and staff were wonderful! It was a great way to relax after business meetings. Hint: Ask the concierge for a discount card if you don't find one in your room. Also, it took me awhile to figure out that the mall area was multi-level, and if you go down another level, there were more food court type options. If you don't explore the lower levels you will never know about the options that are available for you right there. This may come in handy if you don't want a full fledged meal or you are traveling with children. There were plenty of options to choose from. In addition there was a drugstore, some clothes stores, and a few other miscellaneous stores. A huge mall is located several blocks away. That mall was intriguing because it housed a large number of stores with names you don't find in just about every mall you go to in the U.S. Had I had more time, I could have done some serious shopping. The one odd thing I noticed at this hotel that I have never noticed at other hotels, is that when my \"neighbor\" was making coffee in the room next door, I could smell it! I love coffee, and this was fine with me, but this was the first time I can say I experienced this smell coming from someone else's room. You normally see reviews where people talk about noise from another room. I didn't experience that---only the smell of coffee in the morning! Finally, Vancouver is breathtakingly beautiful, and my room allowed me to further experience the beauty. I had a great view of the mountains with snow on top, the harbor down by the convention center, and the huge beautiful flowers that connected the space between. Ask for a room facing the direction of the harbor.

The hotel is at an excellent downtown location. The Burrard station is across the street from the hotel. It is close to many attractions. The furniture, TV, decor and bathrooms have modern themes. They are tastefully done. We had access to the Regency Club Lounge on the 29th floor. The breakfast had a baked goods, fruits, cheese and smoked salmon. We also tried the afternoon appetizers which were also nice. As we travelled with a toddler, I had some pet peeve with some of the amenities: 1. The shower comes from the ceiling, which is very trendy but not very practical for us. While we could slightly tilt the angle, we couldn't adjust the intensity. Also, water coming down from the ceiling makes it hard to shower a toddler. Unlike the Westin's heavenly shower which features double shower heads, it allows you to adjust both the angle and intensity. It was much easier to shower the toddler using the double heads. 2. The bathroom lacked counter space. The counter had a vase with live plant, soap dish, glasses and tissue box. It made it difficult to put essential children toiletry items on the counter. 3. The towels are rolled up into small cubby shelves under neath the counter. While it looks nice asthetically, it is not as practical because it is far away from the tub. It requires about 3 steps from the tub to reach the towel. It would be more practical to have the towels closer to the tub. 4. Furniture have sharp corners. The business desk, night stands, drawers, coffee table all have sharp corners. With a toddler running around, it is easy to hurt themselves by bumping into one of those corners of the furniture. Overall, the hotel is business oriented located at an excellent location. But, it could improve on some amenities to make it more children friendly.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cWhat a gem, in the heart of Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "lovehvar", "ReviewID": "UR108251276", "Content": "Really enjoyed our stay in a room with a view of the water and a balcony.

We choose to book our hotels through Priceline as we never pay the full price of the room and we always get a wicked deal. Well, we got a room at the Hyatt for 100.00 plus taxes and service fees via priceline so for 123.00.

It's normally 37 so we were all pretty happy about that :) When we go to check in we dealt with Magdalena. She was so great. I am a retail store manager and I recognize when someone actually values what they do for a living and actually cares. She was so great and made our arrival so easy. She offered us a 10 dollar upgrade to a room with a balcony or view, as well as they had a promotion on if you chose this upgrade you recieved a 20 dollar starbucks voucher for the morning ! How perfect is that ? She knew we booked through priceline - as all hotels know - but for once, never did she treat us as a third party booker. She gave us a beautiful room that had a view of the mountains, as well as came out from behind her desk to give us our room keys, and show us where the elevators are. We were also aware that there was a huge convention happening for some company and never did that once interrupt our hotel experience or service. All these little things actually do matter, and it makes me want to stay at the Regency again, and I've stayed at a few higher end hotels in Vancouver, and none will stick in my mind as this one will. In the morning, we got our free starbucks breakfast and drinks and another gentleman at the front desk checked us out. We were in room 2208 and it was such a beautiful view and a beautiful room.

We stayed the first night at the rack-rate and the subsequent 2 using frequent traveler points. For the first night, we stayed in a \"regular\" room and then were upgraded to a suite for the next 2. Both rooms were lovely and, frankly, while the suite was nice, nothing was really missing from the first room to really make me overly envious of having missed the suite on the first night. Parking downtown is expensive and the attendant at check-in gave us some tips on saving money. At breakfast, my wife developed a cough and a very attentive server brought over a \"home remedy\" of hot water, lemon and honey. When we moved from the first room to the second room, the attendant that moved our belongings was very helpful, quick, and efficient, not to mention the move took place earlier in the day than we had anticipated and allowed us to (re)settle in.

Its lobby is connected to a small shopping area that has a large Chinese restaurant, Tim Hortons and McDonalds as well as a foodcourt. I will begin with the booking process, which was laden with several problems. I made my booking on the telephone and at the time of booking, I told the booking agent several times that I was to spend 9 nights with 3 adults and 1 child (1 room). After making the booking, I received a confirmation email stating the price for 1 room for 1 adult and 1 child. Upon seeing this, I immediately rang up Hyatt reservations on two separate occasions and was assured that the booking was made for 3 adults and 1 child and that the price stated in the confirmation email was indeed for the 4 people. However, upon checking out of the hotel, I was shocked to receive my bill which stated that I owed an extra CAD600 because there were 3 adults and 1 child in the room. It was beyond disbelief that Hyatt reservations, on two separate occasions, had misinformed me that the price stated in my confirmation booking was for 3 adults and 1 child. I immediately contacted the hotel manager. According to him, a second confirmation email was sent with a new price for 3 adults and 1 child. I found it incredulous that: (i) Hyatt telephone reservations told me that the original booking was for 3 adults and 1 child and not 1 adult and 1 child; and (ii) even if Hyatt reservations did change my booking from 1 adult and 1 child to 3 adults and 1 child, they did not inform me of a price change on the phone, and that a new automatic confirmation email informing me of the price change failed. Luckily, the hotel manager saved the situation by waiving the extra charge. Had it been otherwise, I would have boycotted staying at another Hyatt Hotel in the future and written letters to senior personnel of the company explaining why I had to pay for its problems inherent in the telephone booking service and its confirmation email system. Anyway, despite that issue, I was more than impressed by the service I received at the hotel. Check-in was efficient and the hotel staff were friendly. The porters knew my family and I by name and were more than willing to help carry my 16 pieces of luggage and weigh them for me (before flying). They did this without hesitation. Housekeeping was personalised. A request form could be filled out for housekeeping every morning. The number of shampoos, conditioners, body lotion etc. provided each day were exorbitant. Internet is complimentary for those who sign up for Hyatt's Gold Passport, which is free. If not, internet costs approximately $14/day from memory. Rooms are spacious and beautifully renovated. There is ample desk space and the room is quite well lit. The beds are comfortable and the sheets are smooth. However, the lobby seems a bit old and the facade of the building requires a facelift. The paint on the outside of the building is greying, making the hotel seem very old and dirty from the outside (but this is certainly not the case inside). The restaurant on the second floor was very good. Christmas Eve buffet was delicious and the restaurant staff were very helpful. I left my name, room number and contact details and they rang me up as soon as there was availability for the Christmas Eve buffet. I also had dinner on a \"normal\" night. Main courses are very reasonably priced (about $27-30) and are of a very high standard. All in all, notwithstanding the unsatisfactory experience I had with the booking process, my stay here at the Hyatt Vancouver was very enjoyable and comfortable. Service was very personalised and staff were attentive and at your service, which is what I expect from top hotels such as the Hyatt.

We had breakfast in our room the next day (Christmas day) and the service and food were excellent. They even included Christmas candy canes with our meal, which was a sweet touch. The first three nights we slept well, and housekeeping was good. However our room had a connecting door with the another room and by the 3rd night new guests moved in next door and we could practically hear every word. By the second night we asked to be moved, as another set of new guests had moved in and they couldn't communicate below a shout. The staff at the desk were very apologetic, and helpful and dealt with it quickly. We were given a new room with no adjoining doors, away from the lifts on the 27th floor. Again another great room, however from this point on the noise got worse, with a family on one side who allowed their kids to jump off the bed, run up and down the corridor, and open and close drawers loudly and constantly while listening to the tv at a ridiculous level. We could also hear the tv on the other side too, even though they didn't have it particularly loud. It culminated on New Year's Eve, when the people upstairs sounded like they were dropping concrete blocks while having a massive screaming match. We didn't complain anymore as we didn't even know who to complain about. The noise levels were coming from everywhere. Now, we completely appreciated it was new years eve, however it was still a hotel, and we had saved to go on this 9 day trip, from a long flight which was now being marred by our accommodation. It was getting to the point we dreaded returning back every evening as we didn't know what kind of sleep we were going to get. It quietened down on our last night, either that or the fact that I had worked out, by turning the air con/heater to full and then putting ear plugs in it drowned out a lot of the noise. On a positive - the staff we met were pleasant and professional. Some were incredibly helpful, and the waitress in the Mosaic Grille on our last day was really really great. It was also good having Starbucks in the lobby for breakfast, and the shops etc next to the hotel were really handy. The views were pretty good, we had a good one of Grouse Mountain, and the coffee and facilities in the rooms were also good.

When we were checking in, it seems like the lady there didn't look through my requests. She assigned us a room on the 16th floor. We asked if there was anything they can do for us as we were there to celebrate a birthday. The lady was pretty much saying no, because we already got a very good deal. I was kind of mad about that. If they do not regularly do anything special, then they can just say it, but the way the lady said it, it seems like its because I was staying there with a coupon that I don't deserve any extras. I also had to request for the late check-in, instead of her offering it to me. The room itself was decent as it was newly renovated, but the bathroom was surprisingly small. We stayed at a corner room, so a lot of space was wasted for the hallway. The TV had snowflakes, but we didn't bothered asking someone to come up and fix it. We called to room service for a pair of slippers and toothpaste. It took us around 30 minutes before we got frustrated and called them again. When we called again, they said they'll bring it right up... and that took another 10 minutes or so. Also, the internet costs $15/day, which I found a bit pricey. They had the gingerbread competition in the lobby, so that was good, very xmas spirit. Overall, I have to say I would be okay with this stay if I was just here as a tourist and service is not my main priority.

I don't really have any complaints about the room or amenities. It was a little pricey, but I guess that is to be expected in a large city. My major complaint is that I purchased the business plan which included free internet, free calls within Cananda and the U.S., free bottle of water each day and free buffet breakfast each day (not including tip). You would think that they could get their computer system to remove these charges automatically, but my final bill was wrong. They didn't remove any of my breakfast charges. I also had to ask the front desk for the maid to bring me waters each day. After I drank my first 2 bottles, she just didn't bother bringing any more, even though I was there for 5 days. And to use the internet, you still have to click that you agree to pay $11.95 a day (or whatever the daily fee was) when you log-in. It doesn't give you the option of stating you are on the business plan, so this creates a bit of confussion as one might fear being charged for the internet even though it is included in the business plan. They need to fine tune their business plan to make it seamless for the traveller. Their are lots of restaurants nearby. The waterfront is only 3-4 blocks away and their is a great waterfront walkway/bikeway called the Seawall that begins beside the convention center - right down the street from the hotel. This walkway follows the waterfront all the way to Stanley Park. Then you can run for 5.5 miles around the perimeter of Stanley Park. It is a beautiful Park. We went to Capilano suspension bridge, but I felt this was way overrated - especially if you have ever walked across a pedestrian suspension bridge. There is really nothing noteworthy there. We also went up to Grouse Mountain. Not much to do there either, but it did offer nice views of Vancouver and the surrounding valley/plain. And they had two grizzly bears which were neat to view.

Also Takis Taverna 1106 Davie St (about 20 minutes walk) is excellent if you like greek food - good value, great atmosphere and huge kleftiko - very popular, sometimes have to wait for a table.

This was the only hotel that ripped me off. While checking in we inquired about the price of parking for our stay and were quoted a price of $38 which he said we could pay via credit card when pulling out of garage. I was letdown to see the elevator from the parking garage, down a few flights of stairs into the hotel was broken. How many times would I really need to walk up those stairs? So I sucked it up. The next day we checked out and the elevator was still broken. One of us went to get the car while the other waited with the bags in front of the hotel. After 15 minutes my friend emerged and said the parking ticket wanted $50 to check out. She had to climb the stairs to tell me this. We complained at the front desk and were assured the rate was the $38 discounted rate and to try again. I went down to take care of parking, sure enough the ticket still wanted $50. I climbed back up the stairs to complain again, they told me the rate should have been $38 and gave me a new checkout card. I was annoyed and went back down to try again. This time the card said it was expired and couldn't accept it. Pretty pissed off by this time I went back up and asked to speak the the manager who was condescending and said \"we don't own the garage, there is nothing we can do.\" That's a nice attitude. I informed him his facility connects to that garage and offers an entrance from the hotel to that garage so it is his problem and that I wasn't thrilled with the numerous trips up and down the stairs with a bad leg. He checked the parking ticket and said \"well, it's fixed now.\" Guess what? Not fixed. I came back upstairs REALLY pissed off. An employee, not the manager apologized and said \"we will take care of this.\" He took about 10 minutes to check on what to do and came back and said \"when you get to the exit area press the help button and we will let you out of the garage, our compliments for the problem.\" A little annoyed no one offered to help with our bags our go with us to the many trips to the garage the entire time to ensure the ticket was being rejected, but that seemed fair. Guess what got tacked on to my hotel bill when I checked my credit card? Oooh yeah, $38 (American funds). So, here's the rundown on the hotel. It was very clean, the location is great, the rooms are very small but typical of city hotels. Room was nicely decorated and updated. You have to pay for internet, so be prepared for that. The service, it bites. The night before the fire alarm went off at 11pm. It went off for about 10 minutes when we finally wandered to the hallway to see what others were doing. There stood the other floor 6 guests having the same debate. One guest informed us firetrucks were lined up outside the hotel (she could see from her window) so as a group we headed downstairs. Via stairs of course. yay stairs. After being outside for about 10 minutes the fire department said it was a kitchen fire and safe to go back in. I mentioned this to the condescending hotel manager after I was pretty pissed off about the whole parking thing and he said \"that's not true, I personally made an announcement no one had to leave their rooms after 2 minutes of the alarm going off.\" Ooooh, really? Since the siren and flashing lights inside the rooms and hallways kept going off, we the guests on the 6th floor thought it would be fun to head outside in our jammies for the heck of it after seeing actual fireman charging into building. He never apologized. It's a nice looking hotel, clean, lots of employees around but apparently no one other than the cleaning staff do anything. No one once offered to help with our bags, sight seeing details, or similar requests. Not the usual 4 star treatment I have experienced at other places. I called the Hyatt accounting department to complain about the charge, out of fairness it was the weekend so they were closed. We'll see if they respond. I'm not optimistic. I am waiting to hear that I clearly don't know how to use a parking ticket. There are plenty of lovely looking hotels in the area, all with about the same rating.

If you are coming from the ship terminals (Canada Place), you can hop on the skytrain and exit the Burrard Street stop. The hotel is right there. Robson Street is a 3-5 minutes walk from the lobby. If you are ambitious, Stanley Park is about a 30 minutes walk from the hotel. It's a nice walk in the morning. Service: Good. Housecleaning good. Check in very professional. The ladies working in the Regency Club were very friendly. Food: The breakfast was in the Regency Club is fine. The snacks during cocktail hours were actually very good. Gym/Pool: Gym was basic in terms of weight machine, but they were all new and the staff kept the gym very clean. The cardio equipment is sufficient (treadmills, elliptical, bike, etc.). There's a smail pool outside. In general, slightly better than an average hotel gym. Room: The room is a nice size, and the decor modern. Nothing stands out, but nothing objectionable either.

We had been in the Four Seasons previously but decided on the Hyatt. We upgraded to the junior suite, whilst expensive it was actually good value for the space we had. We didn't get off to a brilliant start with an 11 hour delay at Heathrow (Air Canada - not the weather). We arrived at 2.30am to a very chirpy check-in and a lovely bellman who was extremely helpful. Initially he only opened the 2nd room and I was slightly shocked to see only a sofa bed - made up really well and no sign of the balcony it was supposed to have. After a quick question he quickly apologised and let us in to the adjoining bedroom. Both rooms were huge and the bedroom had a great balcony with fantastic views (26th floor). The bathrooms were spotless and the bed was extremely comfortable. Having a suite was lovely, after a long day on foot I was able to chill in the 'living room' whilst my other half had a snooze. We spent ages on the balcony taking fantastic night shots. Having the ipod radios was great as we had our ipods with us. The free coffee machines were good and there also tea. The mini bar was expensive but you would expect this from any higher end hotel. The only gripe was the water at 5 dollars a bottle - very expensive. Cleaning was exceptionally good and any requests were responded to straight away. The restaurant was great for breakfast and the staff very attentive - I love that they had an egg station so I could have omlette for brekkie. However breakfast was expensive - we found a couple of great cafe's serving lovely breakfast at a fraction of the price. We had an evening meal there as well and it was ok but overly salty, I mentioned this to the waiter and he was extremely apologetic and offered a free dessert straight away. Overall I could not fault this hotel, it's really well located for Robson Street (the main shopping road) and a very short walk to the Sea Bus and train station, along with the Harbour Centre and the revolving restaurant. The only downside was the noise from an adjoining room - one evening they were playing instruments and we could hear them clearly!

Just needed a way to escape the room and this hotel featured the rare Vancouver balcony. This treasured balcony was large and triangular in shape. Oddly, it had a rather large light shaped and sized like your old style hubcap that was mounted to the wall. It was really bright, almost like it was put there to warn ships in the harbor. I called the front desk and asked how I could shut this light off. The nice young lady at the desk told me that \"you can't shut it off, it shuts off automatically at mid-night. But you should have heavy drapes in your room that you can close if it bothers you\". At this response I had a laugh and sensing how strange I thought their balcony light protocol to be, she cheerfully told me that she \"could send someone up to take the light apart and loosen the bulbs\". Now that is service, though I declined. It did finally shut off at 1AM. On arrival at the room the bellman explained that ice was available on the floor below us. A few minutes later I took the ice bucket to go in search of ice, leaving my wife and the room key card behind. Arriving at the ice machine I discovered you needed your room key card to enter the ice room. I hadn't run into this before, but ok, I headed back to the room to retrieve the key. Of course now I couldn't operate the elevator without the key. The greater point is this. If Hyatt needs to lock access to their ice machine it suggests they don't really have any control over who is wandering around their building. Finally this, if you do choose their balcony room, it come with an added benefit. The door to the balcony functions like an exercise machine. The door is heavy and the sliding tracks not maintained at all. Opening the door just 16 inches is sort of a combination bench press and squat exercise.

Kristen at the front desk was a joy to deal with and upgraded our room and gave us a major discount. We had just spent an extra $200 on our rental car and needed a bit of cheering up and she did the job quite well!! We were very impressed with the service. Hotel wise it was great. Obviously updated rooms which felt modern but cozy. We had a balcony with a great view of the water and Grouse Mountain. The hotel was within walking distance of a lot of things. I was shocked at the amount of homeless people and how aggressive they were. We live in Toronto which is not without its homeless but I have never had experiences like this. We were sitting in a restaurant just up Burrard and had a couple gentleman (homeless) come up to the window and stand there tapping on the glass and watching us eat (with hands stretched out I might add). All in all it was very uncomfortable to say the least...Anyways, we had rented a car and were trying to get creative with the parking. $28 a day sounded a little steep. The front desk was actually very helpful with alternate arrangements and did not force us to use their service. We ended up parking both nights on Melville street which runs along the north side of the hotel. We were warned about break ins, but we just removed EVERYTHING from the car (change/GPS etc) and had NO problems. It is $2 for 24 minutes which is high BUT if you park after 8 its free til 9 the next morning. We made sure to be there for 8 and ended up paying virtually nothing for parking the whole trip. Saved a lot for sure. The room was nice. I agree about the shower being a touch odd. Very nice and modern in theory but the water pressure was not great and it was hard to find a great angle for the square recessed head. Street noise was there but we actually slept with the patio door open for that reason. All part of the ambiance of a city. Unfortunately the outside light was on the first night ALL night (on the balcony) which I am assuming is a safety measure as the railings were not very high. About to my waist and I am 5'8. The second night it was mysteriously off so that was alright. We booked through priceline and got a great deal. The only real downside is the amount of security. Don't get me wrong, security is a nice thing to have BUT when we walked in after 9pm there were employees everywhere which seemed like veiled security dressed up as bellman. Using the room key to get up to the room seems like a popular thing these days and im cool with that.

We were originally offered a king-size bed on the 12th floor, but I asked if we could get 2 double beds instead, and was kindly accommodated and switch down to the 5th floor. As previously mentioned, this room is at the corner of floor pretty much. As you opened the door, you get a long hallway, then make a right turn before you see the actual room. Its perfect if you have lots of luggages since there was a lot of space in this \"hallway\" as you entered the room. There was a huge desk with a lamp at the corner of the room. Everything was clean and the bathroom was just perfectly lit with just the right amount of lighting. From this room, we can see the pool & hot tub, and there were people in the hot tub still at around 10pm. No noise issue though since this room faces away from the street. Even though we were on a low floor with absolutely no view but the pool & hot tub, it was good enough for us since we were on a 9am-9pm schedule and the view doesn't really bother us that much. The beds were comfortable and room temperature was comfortable. The beds do look a little small for a double bed though. But for 2 small people sleeping in one bed, that wasn't a problem at all. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to others. After reading all other reviews, and if you don't care much about the view, request for a room that faces the pool & hot tub. That side is much quieter, and I had no noise issues whatsoever on a busy weekend on the 5th floor. Getting to the hotel was convenient with the newly opened Canada Line Train. It took us 45 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel (Burrard Station). Once you walk out of the train station, the hotel is right there (less than a min walk).

We booked through the cruise line for 2 rooms at the hotel by we had 3 rooms on the ship, so I think that's what caused some confusion. Initially they said we had three rooms, which we would have taken since they said we booked and paid for 3 rooms, but when it came down to it, they found out that we really did only have 2 and one of the rooms listed 0 people being in it which confused them. It took us a good 30 minutes to finally check in. We were given an ocean view room on the 6th or 8th floor, I can't remember, but there are more than 30 floors in this hotel, so it was one of the lower ones. The \"ocean view\" room we received meant that we could see a sliver of the ocean if you looked far down a busy street. I would never have considered this an ocean view. Maybe if you were higher up you might have seen more ocean, but not where we were. I also found the rooms to be very loud and the traffic below woke me up several times in the middle of the night. I didn't have any issue with noise in the hall or other rooms, but outside was the loudest. The hotel is located on a busy street, so the noise was really a problem. This was the biggest issue for me because it did wake me up multiple times in the middle of the night, and I was exhausted from our trip from the East Coast, so to be woken up, shows how loud it really was. I really enjoyed the modernity of this hotel because that's my style. The rooms were very modern with a nice desk, 2 double beds that seemed VERY small, not like other double beds I've slept in. The one complaint I could see people having here was that the lighting in the bathroom was very modern, but not super bright. I would have liked more light when showering, but it wasn't horrible. If I was going to a special event and needed to really perfect my makeup, I might have struggled as well, but I wasn't doing much makeup since I was on vacation and tend to just do the basic foundation, eyeshadow, and mascara when I'm on vacation, so it wasn't a big deal. We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't speak to the food there. We had breakfast at the Tim Horton's across the street the morning we had to leave for our cruise. For dinner, we went to a restaurant that the concierge recommended down near the water. This hotel was in a decent location. We walked down to the pier and walked around for a while. You could see a lot of the work being done for the Olympics all around the city. You could walk to the pier if you're taking a cruise and IF you know that your ship is going out of the nearby pier. We sailed with Celebrity, and our dock most certainly was not within walking distance. We did have an issue with getting our transfer tags for our luggage at the hotel. The hotel claimed they didn't have our tags and tired calling Celebrity but said they got cut off. We tried dealing with this for a good 30-45 minutes with the hotel but got nowhere. They told us to go have dinner and they'd work on it when we were out. They weren't there when we returned after dinner, and we had to make several phone calls to the hotel and the cruise company to finally get them LATE that night. It was a big inconvenience, but luckily other people in our party were the ones taking care of things. I never found out who's fault it was, but there was a breakdown in communication here. We were very surprised when we were told that they wouldn't be mailed to us like in other cruises but that they would be waiting for us at the hotel. I mention this bit to help others out in case they're staying here prior to a cruise as well. Would I stay here again? Maybe. We weren't too concerned about our hotel and someone else picked this one in our party as our night before our cruise. I'd have to do more research if I were to return. I will say, I didn't hate this hotel, but I didn't love it either. If I were to stay here again, I'd request a higher floor because the noise was really bad and is the main reason this hotel only has 3 stars.", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery nice...OK for a nite.\u201d", "Author": "traveljack1", "ReviewID": "UR39398986", "Content": "Stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Vancouver for one night prior to an Alaskan cruise.

There was actually a door there with a phone to call the main bellman station to assist persons at that door with their luggage. That helped a lot since my sister and I had about 7 bags between us! The bellman came right away and put our luggage on a conveyor that took it too the main lobby area of the hotel! The room was typical with no real view, but we didnt expect one since we got the room for a steal on Hotwire. We were in a corner room on the fifth floor(519 I think) facing the air conditioning units and the backside of an office building. The front desk check-in was a little different, it was all electronic. We would not have had any human interaction at all at check in if my credit card had swiped correctly. There was staff there, but they let guests check themselves in and out at three sort of \"kiosks\". That was different, but I guess a little speedier if it gets busy.

The lobby of the hotel is hectic and confused and common areas do not offer any sense of luxury at all. But once in your room or on your balcony, this becomes a heaven of peace and you can really relax after a long day walking around this fabulous city. One downside: all balcony rooms are connecting rooms, which means they can be somewhat noisy at times depending on who is staying in the room next to you. The hotel has a weird ecological policy that allows them NOT to replace linen and even used towels every day unless you specifically call a special number and make arrangements with them. This is pure lie \u2013 this only saves them money and time on housekeeping. Why would they keep the balcony lights on all night (who needs light outside the room when you sleep?) if they really cared about environment and ecology? For me, this is a pure non-sense and nothing else than an attempt to rip clients off. Although this is a huge hotel with constant traffic in the lobby and in the lifts, service and front desk were top notch and staff really attentive to your needs.

An incident which gave me a rude awakening : 2:30 AM : i heard someone was trying to open my room, so i decided to look thru the peep hole and saw a couple outside. and when i told them that it's my room, and i've stayed there for a week, they showed me their keys which said 2907 (my room). Manager on duty (Maria) apparently gave my room to someone else. (after i checked with her that night, her excuse was a hiccup in the system). i have double checked with her colleague (Kristen) and a lady at Regency Club concierge day a day before about my booking, and both confirmed my stay till the 20th. This raised a concern, if this happened during the day time when i wasnt in the room, someone could have entered my room. 4. SOME of the staffs (bell boy, door men) - I was carrying lots of stuffs, none offered to open the door nor help in carrying the goods up into my room. 5.

We're extremely happy with what we received for the price we paid: an absolutely lovely room and a hotel with unerringly helpful and friendly staff. First, the room. Maybe we've been staying in the wrong places, but the decor in the room we received was far more style-forward and modern than any hotel we've visited in recent memory. We were very impressed, especially when comparing the rate we paid for a passable small-town motel room the night before. Location is excellent, on Burrard just a couple of blocks away from Robson and basically sitting directly on top of Burrard SkyTrain station. Stanley Park is also a fairly easy walk. The staff created an excellent first impression. From the woman who assisted in checking us in to the bell staff, everyone jumped to serve us -- whether they were likely to receive a tip or not. This attitude continued throughout our stay. Indeed, the check-in lady advised us -- very kindly -- to pay for parking directly with the garage, since we weren't planning on using the car on our three nights (and therefore didn't need in-out privileges) as it would save us money. In the end we paid $60 for the three nights of parking -- two of them weekend nights -- versus the $84 it would have cost at the hotel's $28-a-night rate. Which really brings up the hotel's main shortcoming: value. For a discount rate, it's a no-brainer. But like many higher-end hotels, you'll be nickeled and dimed on incidentals. Parking, as mentioned is $28 a night. A lot, but I've seen worse ($35US a night for self-parking in downtown Seattle, for one). High-speed Internet runs $15 a night. After asking about the business centre and later hearing someone else ask a different concierge person, there may or may not be charges for it, and if there are they're pretty astronomical. Crazy hotel rates for direct-dial long distance ($12 for a two-minute call within Canada). At the rate we paid, these were no big deal. And I suppose for the type of person who routinely seeks out four-star accommodation at full rates, they're just a drop in the bucket. But there are obviously other quality hotels around the downtown area that advertise better rates and get similar accolades on this site. I wouldn't try to dissuade anyone from using this hotel.

The other room had a more traditional showerhead which I slightly preferred. The rainfall showerhead is a neat idea. The bathroom mirror was my favorite with a fog-free circle in the middle surrounded by a light. Extremely classy! The only thing the bathroom could have used was a makeup mirror. I had rented a car in Seattle and drove up. Thanks to other reviewers on here I was aware of the famous Chinese parking garage located a short distance from the hotel.

There's a parking garage with chinese lettering on the top of the sign. Instead of paying $28CAD a night at the hotel I walked a short distance and only paid $13.50 here. The people working at this garage are the NICEST people and were so friendly. I happily gave them my money and would rather support them than the Hyatt's parking. Internet - The Hyatt charge a lot but you should also see a wireless service available called \"Guest Internet Access\" which is much cheaper. I paid $16 for 2 days rather than the Hyatt's $16 a day.

On the 14th floor during my second visit it was much stronger. I didn't like the self check-in because I wanted a higher floor. Despite booking on priceline, they accommodated requests and were VERY friendly! They even offered to go to the room with us to make sure the key works. Talk about service! I couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel. Excellent service, clean, friendly, modern, and a great location. The gym was very good and the pool area was fine for a city hotel. Unbelievable deals available on priceline. Vancouver has a lot of vagrants and homeless looking people but they weren't too aggressive but they did become annoying. While in town check out Stanley Park and the Capilano suspension bridge, both excellent.

Hyatt, put that kiosk behind a counter and let one of your front desk personnel go through all of the hassle of making sure my reservation is correct! While we were fighting our way through your system, there were Hyatt employees at the Concierge desk who were just chatting with each other rather than helping someone. Bell service could not have been better. And the loaner umbrella that they leave in the room is a great touch. The only serious problem is the restaurant. The food is only okay. The service in the restaurant is a little below average. In spite of the fact that the restaurant thus grades out below average, it is hugely expensive. Had dinner there one night, which was pricey but pretty good. It was a worthwhile choice because it was so very convenient. However, also had breakfast there once, which turned out to be a huge mistake. $25 breakfast buffet that would have been only average, at best, even if it had been eight dollars cheaper. Did not eat lunch there at any time, frankly because we could find lots of less expensive, convenient options. Finally, what is it with Vancouver restaurants that you need to wait an age for the bill? We had that problem everywhere. We are resigned to having Hyatt charge us for high speed Internet. That does not mean that we have to like it. On the plus side, they have new fitness equipment. The variety is limited, and the fitness facility is rather small. This is still workable if you go early or very late, and the fitness center is open 24 hours. We did get a decent rate at the Hyatt, and the location is very convenient.

We stayed at this same property last winter via Priceline, although I can't recall the rate we got then, and we enjoyed both our stays immensely. First of all, the location is just perfect...walking distance to everything you want to do downtown and across the street from the Sky Train if you want to wander afield. There are countless restaurants, pubs, cafes, markets, shops nearby for anything you could possibly need within a short walking distance. The service we got from the staff was absolutely top-notch, even though the hotel was crowded to bursting for the long weekend. Check-in went very smoothly, as did check-out. Everyone was friendly and professional and efficient. Our only hitch was the parking--as stated in other reviews, it's $38CN to valet with the hotel, $28CN to \"self-park\" with a hotel \"pass\", and, in our case, cheaper than that to just pay the garage meter directly. We checked the car into the garage on Saturday afternoon at around 4pm, then out again on Sunday afternoon, and the fee was $10.50CN. We checked back into the garage on Sunday evening around 7pm, where the car remained until we left at noon on Tuesday. The 2nd time, the fee was $45. That's a total of $55CN, and the hotel would have charged us 3 full days at $28/CNday, or $84CN total. Now, the price may vary if you are checking your car in and out several times per day, but we only used our car one day, to drive up to Whistler. So my advice is to check out the rates carefully, know what your plans are with your car, and pay accordingly. Also, using the hotel \"pass\" is a pain, because you have to buzz an attendant upon entering (or is it exiting?) and wait for him to validate. We never could make that system work, so ended up canceling the parking pass with Hyatt and just paying the garage directly, which as I explained above, was significantly cheaper anyway. The rooms are enormous...we ended up with a double double on the 23rd floor, facing Burrard--great city views with peek-a-boo glimpses of mountains and water. The rooms are extremely comfortable, decorated in neutral tones of gray, black, white, and brown, but the beds are great--nice crisp linens, down comforters and pillows, with extras in the closet. Amenities included a good-sized room safe, huge closet with lots of hangers, an ironing board and iron (full size), a folding suitcase stand, which fits easily in the back of the closet to get your empty suitcase out of the way, and a loaner umbrella. The bathrooms are black marble, well-equipped with plenty of towels, etc. The toiletries are nicely scented and include shampoo, conditioner, bath soap, facial soap, body lotion, and a shower cap. The showers have the fun \"rain\" head, which sprays directly down onto you out of the ceiling. There is a full-size hair dryer in one of the cubbies, but there is no make-up mirror, and the lighting in the bathroom is fairly dim--this is my only complaint about the hotel room. The vanity is kind of deep, so it's hard to even lean in close to the mirror when trying to put on mascara! There is a double low-boy which has 4 good size drawers for unpacking--with the closet, you could unpack and live here easily for a week! There is a desk with lighting and extra built-in plugs for your electronics, as well as a surge protector, so we were able to plug in everything we needed without having to sacrifice a lamp, etc. The low boy includes a mounted flat screen TV above it, which we only used for about an hour, but it was great quality and convenient. Between the beds was a nightstand with 2 deep drawers to hold our books and incidentals, and a nice clock radio with an iPod docking station that we used to listen to music while in the room. There is only 1 reading lamp between the 2 beds, so if your partner likes it dim while you read, might want to bring your own booklight. There is a small \"dry bar\" in its own alcove, which has nice countertop space for the ice bucket and bottled water sold by the hotel. The coffee maker and supplies are there, as well, and beneath is the mini-bar fridge, which had room for us to stash our own water and drinks supply. We also had room on the counter for our own fruit and snacks, and there are some cubbies below to stash more goodies as well. As usual, the mini bar snacks are expensive, so if staying more than a night or two, go to one of the many local markets or convenience stores and stock up at much better prices. All in all, the room is really well laid out, with floor to ceiling windows across the whole room, so lots of natural light if you want it, and good heavy drapes if you don't. The air-conditioning/heater unit worked perfectly--we used both, since one sunny day, the room started to heat up a bit in the afternoon, and few chilly mornings, we cranked up the heat while we showered. We had drinks in the Mosaic bar one evening--nice views and friendly staff, if a bit soul-less, but it's a hotel bar, after all. We also had room-service on our last night, after a long day and evening out...it was nearly 10:30pm when we ordered, and the staff did not flinch. Our food arrived hot and promptly, and although yes, it was outrageously expensive ($17 CN for a hamburger and fries), the quality was VERY good--the meat patties were thick and lean-tasting, the veggies crisp and cold, the buns warm and toasted and the fries crisp and hot-- and we were, after all, paying for the convenience of eating in our pajamas late at night! I recommend their chocolate cake, by the way...it's heavenly! Our room was serviced every day without anyone banging on our door impatiently, even though one afternoon, we stayed in reading and relaxing until after 1pm. We were given extra toiletries, clean towels, and everything straightened up nicely each day. Everything seemed very clean and well-maintained. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and wouldn't hesitate to stay again, although, since we always priceline our hotels, we don't normally get to pick them. I'm encouraged, however, that we've won the Hyatt twice now, as it is quickly becoming our favorite place to stay in Vancouver.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Beautiful view, Clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "Cali54", "ReviewID": "UR24677134", "Content": "The hotel is within walking distance to prime shopping (Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Gucci) and two blocks away on Robson street holds major brands ( Banana Republic, BCBG Maxaria, Gap, etc) to cute little boutiques.

We'd read previous reviews complaining about the decor and, more important, internet and parking charges, so we were prepared. After doing some more pre-trip research, we learned about a few other parking options and decided not to take our computers. The hotel itself is extremely well located in downtown Vancouver. Robson is just a few blocks away, and you can walk to the SeaBus to North Vancouver (or take other public transportation anywhere else). If you can avoid taking a car, you'll be better off--in many ways, it's more of a hassle than anything else. We'd driven up there, though, and we really didn't want to pay the $28 per night (or more, for valet) parking charge in the hotel's lot. So we checked out a TripAdvisor tip about a parking garage nearby that was a lot cheaper. Here's the scoop again: Drive up (going south from the hotel) Burrard a short distance. Just after you pass Alberni, but before you get to Robson, you'll see a small alley on your right. Turn into the alley and you'll see an apparently Chinese-owned parking garage. We parked our car in this garage for 3 nights. Each night was different--I think the rates and times the attendant decided on depended on how many reserved spots he anticipated getting the next day and at what time. We arrived at the lot around 4 p.m. each day. The first night, we paid $12 (Canadian) to leave the car there until 11:30 a.m. the next day. The second night, it was $5 until 10:30 a.m.; the third, $5 until 9:00 a.m. So we paid a grand total of $22 Canadian for 3 nights of parking--much better than the $84 or more the Hyatt's lot would have cost us! This lot is just a couple of blocks from the hotel, so walking there is no problem. As for the hotel itself, we really liked it, especially at our fantastic rate. We thought the new decor was very nice, but I can understand how some people might find it dark. It's very Asian/Zen-like in feel--I've posted some photos. Interestingly, we discovered while looking for a phone book that the bottom drawers of both the nightstands and the dresser didn't open. Maybe it's a cultural thing? Anyway, it wasn't a problem. We had two double beds for 3 people; queens would have been nice, but the Hyatt isn't the only chain that uses doubles. Choosing doubles over queens for multiple-bed rooms seems to be a decision hotel chains make either to make the rooms look bigger or to save money. But queens are definitely more comfortable The rain shower was okay--we're used to the typical angle of showerheads, but it was fine. The flat-screen TV had lots and lots of channels--very nice! The TV makes a strange sound when you turn it on, sort of like a video game sound, but that was okay. We also had a nice view from our room (see photos). The only contact we had with the hotel staff was at check-in and check-out, and everything went fine. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt and would stay there again.

There is a McDonald's and Tim Horton's connected to the hotel for those who'd rather spend less on breakfast and there's a grocery store about 5 minutes walk away. The sushi restaurant up the street is really good too, and there are tons of restaurants on Robson (about a 2 min walk) to choose from. The location is perfect -- close to shopping, restaurants, the waterfront, nice jogging paths in Stanley Park, etc. The gym is small but clean and well-stocked with free weights and lots of treadmills. The cardio machines are very modern and all have tvs built into them, which I appreciated. I did not try the pool or hot tub as they are outdoors and I wasn't going to brave the cold, but I did see a few people using the hot tub.

The trendy showerhead in the Hyatt isn't a showerhead at all, it's a square in the ceiling that rains down on you. For me with thick hair, it was pain getting the shampoo out with the lack of angle. Trendy is not always practical. Being at a conference the service here was great! The internet is expensive in the ballroom and the food was too, but that's the Hyatt quality. I missed the Q-tips that normally come with the Starwood bathrooms. Robes at the Hyatt are nice. Gym is a fair good size and pool is decent with a great hot tub. Our room looked down onto the pool, so not exactly private pool or hot tub - something to think about if you get a room on that side of the building. Parking is crazy at $28 for 24hrs, so I recommend walking everywhere or the SkyTrain entrance is right beside the hotel. Staples is also at the side door of the hotel so very convenient if you need to make photocopies instead of using the hotel's Business Centre. Tim Hortons & McDonalds are on the other side of the hotel. The Club lounge on the 29th is lovely for snacks if you qualify to go in the lounge. Great outdoor patio people often miss off the lounge, since it's tucked further into the room. Since we were on the 27th floor and the lounge was on the 29th, I tried taking the stairs since it would be faster, but access was locked.

My fiance and I decided to spend the weekend by splurging - rather than our usual \"budget\" accommodation. The Hyatt has been newly renovated. We chose a \"balcony room\". These rooms provide you with a great view of downtown Vancouver. The \"balcony 'view' rooms\" look out over the ocean/mountains. I guess it depends on how much you're willing to spend for the view. The room, itself, is really great. We loved the set-up. The flatscreen TV was a nice touch. The bathrooms are very modern with the shower/tub being one of the best I've found of the many hotels in which we've stayed. My fiance noted, however, that the lighting does not lend itself toward the easy application of makeup. I've been told that it's too dark and should illuminate from the front - not from behind. As a guy, I was fine. The bed is the best I've ever slept in, ever. Extremely comfortable. It needs to be. Even on the 12th floor, the sounds of downtown Vancouver can be heard. Mostly, it's muffled quite effectively. Sirens, however, are common and clear. It's the downside of the great, centralized location. As with other Hyatt's, ice machines are not placed on guest floors. You can get ice in a special room, on the 4th floor, or through room service. While other reviews mention the quality of the hotel food, I found the cost to be very expensive so we didn't make any purchases. As an example, the water bottles placed in the room (which, in many hotels are complimentary) cost $3.95. Additionally, the coffee maker does not come with a little coffee pot. Instead, it only provides one cup servings. Really good coffee, though. We enjoyed a drink in the lounge. The jazz trio was really good and the ambiance was well worth the visit. The staff were awesome. The pool was not too impressive. We enjoyed a short swim. The hot tub, while small, was clean, hot and the jets worked very well. Nice - small - workout area.

From the 15th thru the 20th I was there on Convention business and the 20th thru the 27th on Gov't business combined with some pleasure. I have never been more disappointed in a Hyatt. Upon check in, my room wasn't ready. After three hours it still wasn't ready. It took a lot of complaining but I finally got a room. The bell boy lingered waiting for a tip. I had every intention of giving him a tip, but he didn\u2019t give me a lot of time to rummage through my purse to get my wallet. It was uncomfortable. Once in the room, I learned that internet access was $16.75 per day. Being that I needed to have internet access for the entire stay, I felt that this was a crazy price. Not all of it was going to be reimbursed by the company, so I called the front desk. Seeing as how I was going to be there for almost two weeks, I wanted to see if there was some way that I could get a discounted rate on the internet. They would not budge stating that the internet was not controlled by the hotel but an external company and that they had no way to compromise on the rate. This I found out was not true when speaking to some of my counterparts who also stayed at the hotel. The parking rates of over $30/day were outrageous. These rates are far more than what should be charged. Because I paid $259 for one week and $159 for the second week, surely I would have thought that something could have been worked out. But no, the hotel staff would do nothing. My husband arrived on the second week of my stay. I needed the bar fridge cleaned out as my husband has a medical condition which requires the use of the fridge for medical supplies. They said that it would cost $15/day to not have anything in the mini-bar. Again, after fighting with them, and the front desk going back and forth to the manager, finally this \"fee\" was waived solely because medication needed to be stored in the fridge. They wouldn\u2019t have gotten one dollar out of us, because we do not use the mini-bar products. $5 for a bottle of water! $17 for a pot of coffee\u2026.no thanks. Calls, are crazy. I was charged 4 times for calls to my cell phone that were allegedly from my room. Now, I was the only one with a key to my room on the date that the calls were charged, and I was not even in my room at the time the calls were supposedly made. None the less, I was charged a $10.35 Connection fee each time along with a .52 cent charge for the call. After a lot of arguing with the hotel, and the hotel stating that they are not responsible for the phone rates as an external company owns the lines etc. etc. etc. The charges were reversed after they charged me for these calls a second time. None the less, I felt that the rates being charged by the hotel were CRAZY. You are better off to use your cell phone or buy a phone card and use the pay phones located in the lobby and second level. The dining options at the hotel again were way over priced. I just could not fathom paying $25+ for breakfast or $20 for a continental! That is nuts! The concierge didn\u2019t even know what time the mall shops opened in the mall that is attached to the hotel, nor were they aware of the services within the mall. I found this to be very unprofessional! This hotel nickel and dimes every one who stays there. It is not worth the money spent (even if you are staying on a corporate rate), and I am so disappointed. I didn't have a choice to stay there for the two weeks, and I certainly will not stay there of my own free will again. It is just a hotel, that has an ego the size of mount Everest and thinks that it is an upscale New York boutique hotel. It is not. I cannot believe the prices and the trouble that I had to go through during my stay! Not worth it by any means! When I contacted the Hotel regarding my complaints again after I returned home. I did not get a satisfactory response, just an email saying SORRY. Try the Sheraton, or some of the cute boutique hotels on Robson. If you like the water, I would recommend the Fairmont Waterfront down by Canada Place. I loved it there.

The carpet in my room was noticeably worn in various places, there were wood chips flaking off the doors and corners/edges of drawers and dressers. Lighting in the room seemed insufficient, but that was probably accentuated by the overall dark colors used to furnish/decorate the room. There was a faded dark stain on my pillow case, and I found a piece of hair (not mine) underneath one of the pillows. Other minor gripes include the fact that they don't provide any complimentary bottles of water (which I've gotten used to from other Hyatts) or slippers, and there was no letter sized stationary (only the small pad sized stationary). The lobby felt cold and uninviting. Positives.... well, besides being dreary, the room itself wasn't too small, and the flat panel tv was a decent 32 inches or so.

I phoned the hotel and was put through to a very friendly bellman/doorman Ray who kindly sent a cab for us (although this isnt a usual part of their service - we loved his 'can do' attitude to help us out).

They also charged for local calls. Even Best Western we've stayed at have those amenities at no charge. Also, the plasma tv did not tell you which channel you were on, so if you changed the channel, you would have a hard time finding that channel again without scrolling through all the channels again. Something minor, but still a nuisance. The water pressure in the bathroom was also fairly weak, but manageable. The ice machines were only on the 4th floor (for a hotel that has over 30 floors), which required that you use your room card to access the elevator and to access the room where the ice machines were at.

But I couldn't use the elevator to go back to my room either, so I ended up going to the lobby in my pajamas to get a new card.

I could tolerate this for this trip, since I was in meetings all day, but at 10pm at night it was still past 80 degrees F. After complaining twice, the building engineer left me a note suggesting I turn on the \"fan\" (which didn't do anything but recirculate the hot air) and/or open my door to let in the artic-cold hallway air. The engineer went on to say that the air conditioning gets \"overwhelmed\" on hot days, which I think is unacceptable. I heard others complaining about the same issue so I know I wasn't alone, I really think this is a top priority for Hyatt to correct. The layout of the hotel is a little strange but not too untypical for a high-rise. The lobby is petit and the conference area pushes up a few floors, but the bigger issue is the elevators. There are five elevators that serve all floors, so the wait time is considerable -- especially during the morning rush. It seemed to us that at least 1-2 elevators were out during our entire stay.

We had a great stay at the Hyatt and were extremely impressed with every aspect of our stay. Here's our rundown... Rooms: Really fantastic - I can't say enough about the rooms. Very recently renovated and in great condition. The beds were very comfortable, the linens were nice, and there were lots of pillows. There was a good alarm clock with radio and iPod connections on the bedside table. The bathrooms were really nice and very updated, and the toiletries (as they are in all Hyatts) were high-quality. The shower was funky - the water didn't come down from a shower head in the wall as is customary but from the ceiling, which took some getting-used-to but was kind of fun. In-room safe, coffee maker, and big flat-screen plasma TVs. No weird stains on the furniture or linens or anything - the rooms really have that new and recently-updated feeling. My favorite part of the room was the view! Fantastic views of downtown Vancouver. The windows were floor-to-ceiling and made up one whole side of our room. We could see the port where cruise ships came in day and night, which was kind of fun. Hotel features: Nice, updated lobby. There is a business center off the lobby with a small charge for Internet access if you don't have a laptop with you. The restaurant on the second floor of the hotel is fantastic. Good hamburgers and salads and FANTASTIC service. I cannot say enough about our waitress at the restaurant; she was one of the friendliest restaurant employees we have ever encountered! We had some outstanding meals in Vancouver and our lunch at the hotel restaurant (Mosaic Bar & Grille) was definitely one of them. Service: Very professional, friendly employees. From check-in to check-out, we were treated with utmost respect. I mentioned the great service in the hotel restaurant above, and we also met some extremely friendly and helpful concierges who gave us restaurant and activity suggestions and also lent us board games that we were able to take back to our rooms to keep and play for a few nights. Location: Right in the middle of downtown Vancouver. A few blocks away from great restaurants and shopping centers (the concierges can give you tips there) and in walking distance from the port where cruise ships leave from Vancouver (10-minute walk). There is a stop for the hop-on hop-off Vancouver bus literally 10 steps from the back entrance of the hotel. The hotel is also connected to a shopping center with a convenience store and Starbucks.

I loved Vancouver then. Now, I'm not so sure. The Hyatt was non-descript from the outside. Downtown Vancouver is very bustling. If I had been asleep and woke up here, I'd have a hard time figuring out what country I was in. The passers-by were a very eclectic mix of all cultures, but it was predominantly Asian in nature. Inside, the hotel was still non-descript. The lobby and public areas were similar to any number of hotels I've visited in the past. My room was quite modern...some good, some not so much. The bed was quite comfortable, yet I did not sleep well. I suspect it was due to the noisy ventilation system, which was too warm for the first several hours. Seems to take a LONG time to respond to a thermostat with tiny numbers. Wish I'd brought my magnifying glass! There's a large desk for business travelers, but I left my laptop home on this trip. I have a PC card for the thing anyway, so I wouldn't have tried the hotel's internet connections anyway. When I sampled the Hyatt properties in Hawaii, they all had i-pod docks and the Vancouver property has them, too. I'll not pass judgment on these since I don't have an i-pod. The bath has one of those curved shower curtain rods, a feature I like. Plenty of high-quality soap, shampoo and conditioner. What I wasn't to fond of was the shower head, mounted not high on the wall as you expect, but in the ceiling so it can \"rain\" down on you. Since the initial blast from any shower is the cold water waiting in the pipes, this was an uncomfortable shock. I'll keep the old-fashioned preference, here. We were all there for business meetings, so food was provided by whatever large-scale kitchen the hotel uses. The chef inventing this menu needs to be disposed of immediately...the food was consistently overcooked, low-quality, bizarre-tasting and just plain terrible. We were actually thinking of heading to a nearby McDonald's for an improvement in quality. 'Nuff said? Vancouver has better hotels with better food.

Sure, you have a map and description but until you're actually there you can't get a sense for the place. In the case of Vancouver, especially if you are visiting for pleasure, the ideal location is the waterfront (ie Pan Pacific and Fairmont Waterfront). The Hyatt is located downtown, as downtown as you can get, in fact. This is fine, but don't expect the sea-to-sky views Vancouver is famous for. The hotel has recently undergone a renovation though it would appear the lobby area and corridors have been untouched. The lobby is laid out strangely and both could have benefited from a theme which reflected the modern, minimalist rooms. That said, the Hyatt offered cheap rates at under CAD$200 per night and friendly, helpful service. The rooms were well done, apart from the walls which were a bit overwhelmingly white and the black/grey colour scheme which seemed a bit corporate. The bathroom included a showerhead inside the bath with curtain. This is unacceptable today in a Hyatt as the curtain both clings to you, blocks your view and lets water escape. The pressure of the shower head was weak as well. If the Hyatt was to fix the aspects mentioned above, it would bring it in line with the chain's standard of deluxe, modern hotels with good service.

Breakfast was a delicious selection of muffins, pastries and home-made breads, but this could be exchanged for anything on the menu of similar value. The waitress was very helpful and brought me a fruit smoothie to test while I waited (only about 30 seconds!) for my food to arrive. I was dining alone, so she made sure I wasn't left waiting and offered me a newspaper/magazine to read while I ate. The concierge was just as helpful and getting a taxi was no problem at all.
