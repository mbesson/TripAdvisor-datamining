No one answered the phone for a couple of days, but I finally reached someone who confirmed the booking by phone. When I arrived, the desk clerk had my reservation but no record of the rate. He tried to charge me $39, explaining that it was a \"holiday weekend.\" (It wasn't; Labor Day was eight days away.) Another employee intervened and the clerk lowered the rate to $29. I charged five nights on my credit card, sight-unseen--a mistake. The room they offered me looked like a drab prison cell. I complained, and they put me in a much larger room with a kitchenette. It had a nice new carpet. But the cinder-block walls were dirty and chipping; the electrical outlets had no face plates; the smoke detector was disconnected; the bathtub was full of dirt and hair; and the bottom of the shower curtain had a three-inch band of black mold.

An additional dish towel in the kitchenette reeked of mildew. In addition, the promised \"free wifi\" was in the lobby only. I needed wifi on this trip, and my room got no signal. It felt like a dangerous place to stay. The next morning I asked for a refund of my unused nights, and was told there was a no-refund policy. (Indeed, I had signed a \"no illegal activity\" agreement, overlooking that it also said no refunds.) When the manager arrived, he did waive the policy and refunded the extra nights, with a small penalty: My first night's room would cost me $40. It was a small price to pay to get out of there. It was evident that the owners take some pride in their motel. When they bought the facility, they say, it was more rundown than it is today. The carpet is a nice touch, and my bed was comfortable.

I found the TOD Motor lodge and I am glad I did!! Their prices are very reasonable and I had a very pleasurable time when I stayed. The staff was most helpful with questions and concerns and the accommodations made it worth staying there. Pancake breakfast on sunday was a wonderful touch for breakfast and I enjoyed the swimming pool they have also. I recommend a stay at the TOD if you happen to be in the area of Las Vegas!!

The actual Hotel is only around a fifteen minute walk from the strip itself and there are buses that roam downtown which are easily accessible. My only concern with the hotel was the lack of organisation and the area that it was. I had to wait around for a couple of hours for simple requests to be managed. If your walking back from the strip late at night, then you need to be careful. For the price I paid, I got a much better deal further on the strip, staying at one of the casino resorts. This hotel is your typical dive, if you don't have a bed job. Although the local neighbourhood bar, called 'Dino's' is a nice place to go to experince a real American bar - highly recommended drinking venue. Only book this place, if it's last minute.", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cClean, friendly and helpful motel\u201d", "Author": "sab27", "ReviewID": "UR10898020", "Content": "We stayed at the Tod Motel for three nights in October and found the staff there to be so friendly and helpful.

Needed a place to stay while looking for housing. Money being an issue I stopped at several motels around town and happened upon the TOD as I was sightseeing on the strip. Compared to the review from 2006 this is definitely a different place. Located on the strip just 2 blocks from the Stratoshpere it is very convenient to both the strip and downtown Las Vegas. This family run motel is being completely redone from top to bottom (without interrupting me). Work progresses daily from new murals on the walls to new security gates. Rooms are modest but comfortable. Easy walking distance to several restaraunts (Boston Pizza right across the street is outstanding!). The people running the place have gone out of their wayto be most accomodating.
