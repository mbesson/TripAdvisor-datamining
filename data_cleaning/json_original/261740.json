Location: Really close to Paddington station and many bus services. Also an easy walk through Hyde park to some museums/attractions, and to the start of Oxford st for shopping. Perfect. Rooms (and all that): The room was big enough for us to sleep and have our clothes spread a bit. The shower is tiny, so without being funny, if you're a rather large person you might have some issues with this. We were on the 4th floor so noise was no problem and after walking a lot around London, we slept quite well each night, although the walls are thin (you can hear other people sneeze and when everyone is going to breakfast in the morning). Cleanliness/service/communication: This was our one really problem, and the reason for 3 stars instead of 4 overall. The case around the flush button on our toilet was off as it had been broken previously, meaning we had to reach in and pull the leaver manually (not all that clean, and the open case caused a mildly unpleasant odour). We asked for someone to look into it during the day. At night, it wasn't fixed so we asked another reception staff, who had no communication with the first receptionist about the issue, to look into it again. The next afternoon, we followed up again with the first receptionist and were told it couldn't be fixed before our stay ended. The broken case/flush itself was a mild inconvenience, it was that we needed to follow up a few times instead of being informed from the start of the problem.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stavanger, Norway", "Title": "\u201cA great experience\u201d", "Author": "bowersjo", "ReviewID": "UR122311442", "Content": "The front desk staff were very helpful, and although we arrived before the scheduled check-in time, we got a room immediately.

I stayed at castleton hotel for a week with my parents (3 people) and we reserved the quadruple room. We stayed at the lowest floor (the basement) and from what I've read in Tripadvisor the basement rooms were suppose to be very noisy.. but to be honest nothing bothered me at all (my room was next door to the breakfast room, like literally beside the breakfast room) and in all the 6 nights Ive spend there nothing ever woke me up. My mother who is a very light sleeper didn't mind the ''noises'' as well, we couldnt hear a thing. The room was very small (compared to american standard rooms) but hey it is Europe we cannot require a big room for a good price... The beds were comfortable and I actually liked the room, even though it was small I felt comfortable in there and thats all that really matters. The bathroom was indeed very small as well and very simple, but very well cleaned and thats all that really matters to me! One thing about the bathroom that actually made me laugh was the size of the sink, so tiny.. but that was not big deal at all. There is no mini bar in the room, that was one thing that actually surprised me! BUT again that was not a problem, at least not for us... we placed the beverages next to the window, if you intend to go to london in the winter time I recommend you to do the same, it actually works! The staff (at least to us) were always very helpful, patient and attentive, I have nothing against them at all.. And about the breakfast, I do not know about it, cause I did not eat breakfast in the hotel at anytime. But my father actually tried it and thought the food was alright, my mother on the other hand despised everything about it.. I think it depends a lot.. but according to my father the food was the traditional english breakfast.. so i guess it depends of how demanding you are.. In general i think the hotel was great, better than what I expected.. It is well located (1 min walk or maybe less) from the Paddington station and also close to bus stops.. The hotel was well cleaned and the staff were very helpful. Yes I do recommend this hotel to people who are not so into luxury things. And yes I would stay there again !

The Castleton provided a full English breakfast (included) every morning. Although there was no variety, the food was consistent and good.

I asked for a refund, since they gave me a room other than what they are claiming on the website, he refused, & he insisted that if the 48-hour notice for cancellation must apply.

So I can\u00b4t judge this hotel in that department. But free advice in that area would\u00b4ve earnt bonus points. The hotel on outside appearance was tidy and presentable. With the foyer/entrance area being neat and presentable. The only downside was getting in the elevator (the elevator floor could\u00b4ve been vaccumed a little). Upon reading previous reviews on the Castleton, I\u00b4d read that some rooms and bathrooms were rather small. In relation to mine this was an understatement! Granted I was expecting to deal with this, the smallness of my room turned out to be the only real disappointment of my stay. There was hardly room to swing a cat (as the expression goes)! Luckily for me I was not planning to waste any non sleeping/showering time in my room. And London is one of the geatest cities to entice you outdoors. Before heading outdoors, breakfast needed to be eaten. This was included in the price. It was standard cereal, toast, eggs (scrambled or fried), bacon and juice or tea/cofee. All you really need. The breakfast room was very small and compact. It was 2 floors under ground. And there were no windows or views. A touch disappointing. Thus I only ate downstairs once during my 4 night stay. The eating hours were between 7-9am. Which while your travelling can be just a bit early. Just one hour more would\u00b4ve been more flexible. Most hotels I have stayed at in London have had breakfasts between 7-10am. Much traveller friendly! Apart from that, I had a pleasant stay. And would return without hesitation.

I booked the hotel via their website and had read the reviews on tripadvisor and elsewhere beforehand. I booked the hotel based mainly on location and price and on both those criteria they perform nicely. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Paddington train and tube station so I didn't have to haul my bags far onfoot. I booked a single room since it was just for myself and to save money although in the future I would opt for a twin or double due to the miniscule size of the room. There is no separate bathroom so the small corner shower, tiny sink and toilet are all next to the bed. My room was in the basement although that didn't really bother me. There was a window and a nice flat screen tv mounted to the wall with a good selection of stations. There is a decent sized lift and the breakfast room was only a few steps away from my room which was convenient as well. Generally the hotel was quiet although I did hear other guests as they walked past my door. The bed and other furnishings were in excellent condition and the room was clean and well kept. However I would suggest that if you have more than one piece of luggage, are claustrophobic or have difficulty getting through small doorways you should opt for a larger room. The shower was very tight getting into and out of and I sleept sideways on the bed (I am 6 feet tall) otherwise I was kicking the wall or hitting my head. If I was any chubbier I would not have been able to get into that tight shower stall. I have stayed in hostels and single rooms elsewhere in Europe and Tokyo and this was by far the smallest I have encountered so far but at least it was quiet, clean and comfortable. Full english breakfast was included in my room rate and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty the items were and how they were served in a nice, clean area with attentive servers. Overall the breakfast I rate highly along with the service I received from the staff. I left my luggage for several hours on the day I checked out so I could take a few tours of London and the front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating for that as well.

The room was small, but not overly so for a single. It had a discrete A/C unit, which worked nicely and is a rarity in a property such as this from what I understand.

The bathroom was a single-piece \"drop-in\" unit that felt about as big as that on an airplane, and I can't imagine anyone of larger proportions would even fit into the shower (which itself is not the best design - water seems to splash out everywhere). I found myself thinking I would have preferred a larger & better appointed shared bathroom to this tiny private one.

The ONLY good thing about this hotel was that it was a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station where you can catch the train directly to Heathrow. This hotel was horrible!!! We have stayed at a lot of hotels across Europe and Australia and a few in the US and this was by far the worst place we have ever stayed. The room was tiny. There was barely room for our bags to be opened at the end of the bed. The bathroom was a joke (will add some photos soon). The bathroom was about 1.5 times the size of an aeroplane toilet. The shower was only separated from the toilet and basin by a curtain. You had about 30 centimeters room when you were in the shower. I am only short and I could reach the roof and both sides of the bathroom at the same time. Ridiculous! Whenever you leave the hotel you have to leave your key at reception which we always think makes you feel a bit restricted if you want to come and go a few times. We were treated really rudely by the man on reception when I paid. He had asked us to pay when we first arrived and we said we would like to pay cash and would go to the ATM and pay later that evening when we returned from dinner. The cost of the room was 79 pounds and when I paid him 80 and asked for change he actually told me off because I did not have the correct money. I explained that I didn't think it was too much change for him to have to give me, and we ended up arguing the fact for 5 minutes. He told me to go out and get some change which I refused to do as I had to leave the hotel at 4am and did not wish to go out again for the evening. In the end he said he would get change and leave it for the morning person to give to us. We had the worst sleep we have ever had in a hotel that night. The bed was springs and not much else. It was horrible. The hotel was just about empty but they put us next to two rooms who knew each other and kept slamming their doors until 2 in the morning. When we checked out at 4am a different man was on reception. The first man had not left the change for us of course. 1 pound is not a big deal, but when you are in the dodgiest hotel in London if not the Northern Hemisphere you do not want to leave a tip.

As Hotels are a major expense we had a very hard time finding something within the budget of a family of five but really lucked out be finding the Castleton a few steps from Paddington Station. Despite it being the cheapest place we found it left very little to be desired. While generally European hotel rooms are small by American standards the Castleton has a variety of room sizes. If you get there and are not satisfied we observed the hotel staff graciously changing a couples\u2019 room to one that was larger. Besides the room being clean, adequate in size, relatively cheap, breakfasts reasonable and the hotel being in an amazingly convenient location the staff is an additional reason for choosing the Castleton. We\u2019ve paid much more money for hotels and not encountered the caring and helpfulness given us by at least 5 different desk personnel.

The front desk staff were friendly and the room, on the first floor was small but clean. The room itself wasn't perfect, very small and the window latches were broken but it was very clean and big enough for a couple of nights. The bathroom was amazing, an all plastic pod, really tiny prebuilt self contained bathroom! But it was big enough to wash in and thats really all you need. My friend did complain about the noise level while we were staying, I slept through it but I am a really heavy sleeper and whenever anyone passed our door to go up or down stairs it was like they were in the room. However if you are just looking for a place to lie your head and can cope with wearing ear plugs then it's not anything to worry about. Finally breakfast.... errm this kinda let the hotel down. The food itself was fine however the first day we were served by a male staff member who was rude, he mumbled to one of us about what we wanted and then tried to run off after only taking one order. It was clear his english wasn't very good but even so, he didn't actually try much. He then brought the wrong food, then when we asked for the correct food he still brought the wrong thing. Without one apology. The second day however we got a normal person who was actual good at there job and all was better! I thought the bad waiter was very, very funny! Extremely Faulty Towers, however those with less of a sense of humour may not have been amused! Anyway, overall it was great value for money, the food was decent and like I have said it was spotlessly clean and the desk staff were helpful and friendly.

It was a good choice. My daughter and I were in room 404, up on the top floor, for the week after Christmas and it was lovely and cozy, with a window over the front street that we could open and close as we liked to change the temperature in the room. (Someone else has posted a photo of it - rust color walls, nice window, \"space station\" bathroom with plenty of hot water, flat-screen TV, tea making supplies...). The beds(we had twin beds) were comfortable with warm thick comforters - which we didn't really need as the room was nice and warm. It was very quiet, except when our neighbors came home late in the evening and had trouble with their door (I suspect they were a little too inebriated to get the key into the lock - there are no deadbolts, by the way, just normal bedroom door locks, which is a little unnerving, but access to the Hotel is limited so we felt safe enough). We could also hear newcomers as they wheezed their way to the final landing outside our door with their luggage. The Hotel is entirely non-smoking, which is a huge plus. The breakfast was made to order (ask for the scrambled eggs, and the English bacon is a delight), with all the toast, juice, cereal, tea, coffee, etc., you want. The Breakfast Room was a pleasant start to the day - breakfast is served 7 to 9:00am, so if you go in there at 7:00 it is almost empty and quite pleasant and you can linger a while. All the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, giving advice as to transportation routes and shopping destinations. This hotel is a very short distance from Paddington Station, with transportation from there to everywhere. (The #7 bus will take you directly to the British Museum along the High Street (shopper's paradise - Soylent Green Is People!), and the Circle Line Tube will take you directly to the Albert and Victoria, Natural History, and Kensington.) No matter where you are in the city, if you spot a bus going to Paddington it takes you home again. We ate a huge breakfast every day, had tea and scones at the V & A museum for a late lunch twice and a good sandwich at the British Museum a few times (you need more than one day for that museum), and had supper near the hotel (either a pasty bought over at Paddington Train Station or a pizza) and so freed up money to take a last-day-there tour out to the ruins at Stonehenge/ Glastonbury/ Avesbury (Anderson Tours, picked up and dropped off at the Hotel door - excellent, inexpensive tour in a mini-bus). There's a Marks and Spencer and another grocery store (plus several other shops - including one that sells Paddington Bear items) at the station, so you can get items to eat in your room if you'd rather not deal with any of the many nearby restaurants. (Our room cleaner must wonder, as every morning there was an empty quart of milk and an empty box of cookies in the trash even if we ate out that night. We fought jet lag with late night TV and cookies and milk!) The only negatives, and they are ~barely~ negatives in my book, are: 1) there are no phones in the rooms so if you don't have a cell phone you have to rely on messages left for you at the desk (they are very nice about that) and use the public phone halfway down the block for outgoing calls; 2) there is no lift in the building - again, this is barely a negative, except for the first day when we had to haul our luggage up four flights of stairs after an entire day on airplanes, trains, and buses. By the end of our week's stay we were bounding up the stairs with no problems; 3) there are only 4 TV stations; and, 4) that you eventually do have to leave - we stayed a week and wish we were back there right now. I am torn as to posting this - it really is a wonderful little hotel. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet, peaceful room. Still, I'd like to keep it a secret so we can always find a room there. We arrived a few hours before check-in, but the desk clerk went ahead and let us have the room early as we were about out on our feet and it was freezing cold outside.
