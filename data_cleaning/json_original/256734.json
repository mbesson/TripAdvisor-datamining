The manager even greeted us upon check-in and made sure we knew to contact her if we needed any assistance during our stay. The night staff people were just as friendly, always smiling as we walked past the desk and willing to provide a wealth of local information. Our suite was incredibly clean and so comfortable (it felt like being at home!). Even the pull-out couch/bed was super comfy to sleep on. We were most impressed by all the little extra things the staff did to make our stay enjoyable, like champagne with strawberries in the lobby (nice!) and complimentary bags of popcorn in our room.

We didn't report it, thinking housekeeping would, so our fault we didn't report it. We were in the room so little after I realized that housekeeping wouldn't report it, I didn't take the time.

The room was very clean and in fairly good condition except the plumbing fixtures could use some updating. Toilet seat was loose (I tightened it - but I shouldn't have had to!) and the water faucets were leaking. Sink didn't drain well. I was on 9th floor and heard no street noise. Kitchenette well furnished. Breakfast was outstanding! Excellent spread, plentiful and at correct temperature. Light supper also great and good to have menu listed in room so no surprises. Again - employees were not very outgoing and seemed unhappy. (Maybe they need a raise or some time off?) Internet free and speed ok. Coffee pot worked but only one coffee package. All other appliances functional. Toiletries great - all Nutrogena stuff, as is usual with Homewood. It was odd that there were no employees (bellman, etc) to assit with luggage or cabs. Door very hard to open and NOT ADA compliant. Taxis difficult to find - finally went across street to other hotel and tipped their bellman to get cab. Again - could have been the post Mardi Gras slump hitting the whole city. I'd stay at and recommend Homewood Suites again. Location good for work and fair for meals.

This is a nice hotel that's in a good location relative to the Superdome. (It's just a few blocks down Poydras Street, so we were able to walk to the Dome & back...no worries about where to park or the additional cost of Dome parking). Parking at the hotel is not included in the room cost, so that's an additional charge if you are using a car. The hotel's parking lot is toward the back & side of the hotel & is well-lit with security doing periodic checks. It is possible for the attendant to have you double or triple park, depending upon how full the hotel is, which then requires you to leave a key in order for your vehicle to be moved, if necessary. The hotel staff were very nice, both at check-in & check-out, as well as any other times we had interaction with them during our stay. The suite was nice, though it needed some minor cleaning throughout...which is the case at a lot of hotels, so I'm always sure to bring my own Lysol & antibacterial wipes. Having a kitchen area with apartment-sized refrigerator, microwave, 2 stovetop burners, dishwasher, utensils & dishes was a plus since we were there for 5 days. Bring your own (or purchase upon arrival) dishwashing liquid, as well as extra paper towels & dishwasher detergent if you will be staying several days. The bedroom area is separated with a door from the living/kitchen area, which is great if one person is wanting to sleep & someone else wants to watch tv, eat, read, etc. There are 2 televisions - one in the bedroom & one in the living area. We were there during a very busy time; thus, there could be quite a bit of street noise at times. We took the advice of some other reviewers & requested a higher floor, which seemed to help. (I always bring a small fan, too when traveling to help drown out any possible outside noises...be it in the hall or out on the street). Bed was comfortable. Closet was spacious. (It's located in the vanity area). Vanity area is spacious, too, but only one sink. The sink/vanity area is separated by a door from the shower/toliet room. But, the sink/vanity area opens into the bedroom. (No door to close it off, which could be a problem if one person has to be up early & others don't...the light or running water may be a problem). Mother's Restaurant is several blocks down on Poydras & has great \"classic Cajun-style dishes\". Yum! We had a car with us, but found it easiest to walk everywhere we went. The Riverwalk, French Quarter & Jackson Square are not terribly far from the hotel, but if you find walking to be difficult in your normal day to day activities, you probably need to consider having a car or taking a taxi to the areas mentioned above.

Why there were vacancies is beyond me--the hotel was very reasonable (think we paid under $200/night), they provide both breakfast and dinner, the rooms are HUGE, and the staff was as warm and friendly as almost any other non-Ritz Carlton hotel in which I've ever stayed. Mardi Gras location is perfect--you are 2 blocks from the parade route, and a few more from the quarter. Getting in and out of the hotel during Mardi Gras can be a bit of a challenge due to traffic and parade routes, so get a schedule, and plan accordingly.

We went through a lot of angst over what kind of hotel arrangements would be right for us and splurged with getting a 2 BR suite for us and the baby, and getting my mom her own 1 BR suite. The prices were such a bargain, however, this wasn't a \"break-the-bank\" splurge! More importantly, we were delighted with our stay in every way! Our rooms were enormous, which was especially nice for fitting in all the gear that comes with a baby. We brought a pack-n-play for him (the cribs at the hotel are the mini ones, which he's outgrown) and it fit easily into a corner of his bedroom. The beds were comfortable, but softer than is ideal for us. The kitchenette is adequate, but a little disappointing on the provisions. There was no dish soap or dishwasher soap, no mixing bowls and no stopper for the sink (it had a garbage disposal, so the strainer couldn't fit in closer and function as a stopper...we improvised by putting a glass in upside down). The water pressure in the showers was not great and one in particular took forever to get hot water going. Beyond the rooms, the facility was great! Welcoming lobby and dining areas. Lovely pool!!! Good laundry facilities and business center. We loved the location!!! We were a few short blocks from Canal Street and had no noise issues at all. We felt very safe and were pleased with eating options nearby (although there weren't many). A great find at the end of our stay was a new, high-end grocery store (Rouses) just a few blocks away!

( I think it was 910). This was perfect and I was extremely pleased with the eCheck-in process. Then when we arrived and we were told that that room was not ready for us yet which was not a problem as we did arrive a little bit early. We were told that that room would be ready in a couple of hours. The girl at the desk secured our luggage and we went for a walk around the city. We returned a couple of hours later and I was told that we could not have room 910 because someone else was in that room. WHY ?? I thought I had secured that room with eCheck In? She told me that she had moved us to room 216. We went to room 216 and I found a much smaller room that the suite I had seen online! Then I went out on the balcony and there was a commercial fan mounted about 8ft up on the wall and this was the loudest fan I had ever heard. There also did not appear any way to turn it off. This would have made it impossible to enjoy this balcony with my wife. There was no way I was spending 7 nights in this tiny, noisy room. I returned to the desk and informed the girl that this room was not acceptable. She checked availabilty again and told me that I could have room 1114 which was a full size suite without a balcony. I told her that would be fine and we waited in the lobby until that room was ready. At about 4:45 we finally were in this room. The room was great, large, very clean and lots of room. Nice kitchen area with all you needed for a nice comfortable stay. The rest of our stay there was very nice. The included daily breakfast buffet was nice. ( it was also a money and time saver) Didn't have to waste half your morning looking for a place to have breakfast.

Nice hotel, friendly staff, nice large and clean suites, breakfast and evening light meal.......what more could you want for an extremely reasonable nightly rate. I highly recommend this hotel for your trip to NOLA. When I return I will definately stay at \"Homewwod Suites\". My only issue was the eCheck-In.

About a 5-min. walk down to the St. Charles / Carondelet intersections to catch the streetcars. Pool looked clean but we didn't use it. Used the hot tub and was very clean. Both pool / hot tub are indoor. Staff was friendly enough. Parking was about $20 per day in a nearby adjacent, uncovered lot. Didn't have any qualms parking the car there. We found the breakfast to be fresh, hot, and very good. It's complimentary (the breakfast). They had an assortment to choose from... scrambled eggs, grits, cereals, watermelon, several different juices, make your own waffles, etc. Breakfast seating area was very busy though, but no big deal... we just sat at an adjacent sitting area in the front of the hotel and it was fine.

They had eggs, bagels/bread, muffins, cereal, yougurt, and juice each morning but the meat changed daily and they sometimes had waffles. They also offered a dinner buffet I think Monday-Thursday evenings, we had that the first day we arrived since it was later in the day....it's nothing grand but the food is decent. The pool area is nice and not crowded, at least when we were there. They also have a nice business center. Also their outside doors lock to the public at 10pm and the only way to get in is by swiping your room key, which I think is a good idea and safe. Location, location, location!!

All other previous Homewood Suites I've stayed in had bottle beer, white, blush and red wine and the food was much better than served at this New Orleans Homewood Suites. Heck, this hotel is in the heart of New Orleans, there has got to be a local person that can cook up some decent New Orleans style food. Until this hotel puts more effort in their breakfast and Managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 event, my advice is to skip it and go to the local restaurants.

I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the room was. I barely ever heard any noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms. There is also a laundry room onsite for hotel guests. The staff was always very friendly and courteous. The hotel is walking distance to the French Quarter. I only have two complaints: (1) Maintenance problems - the first few days I was there, I had a problem with the toilet. I called the front desk to request maintenance. The desk clerk informed me that there wasn't a maintenance person onsite but that housekeeping would bring a plunger for me to use. No one ever brought a plunger. I ended up fixing the problem myself. (2) the parking lot - Other reviewers have described the condition of this lot and the difficulty in parking. Everything they have said is true. The parking lot is an open self park lot down a dark side street behind the hotel. The lot is badly deteriorating and is sorely in need of resurfacing and re-striping. The lines between parking spots are so faded as to be barely visible, especially at night. The only way to fully appreciate the condition of this lot is to see it in person. One night I parked next to a large SUV that was parked at an angle which prevented me from parking straight. The next morning I found a \"parking violation\" notice on my window warning that I was \"illegally parked\" because my car was not exactly within the lines. I'm not sure how I can be \"illegally parked\" in a space I was paying $19 a day to use. The \"notice\" also warned that future violations would result in my car being towed. Unbelievable. So, if you have a car, I would advise staying anywhere else. There is a Hilton hotel about 5 blocks away if you want to be at a Hilton property, otherwise there is a Drury Inn right across the street or numerous other options around town that have a better parking situation.

There are also no grocery/convenience stores within a few blocks, so after the first night we learned to stock up while we were out. 2) Parking: The parking offered is in a lot behind the hotel. It's convenient, but the lot itself is physically deteorating, expensive ($18 a day!) and on weekdays you WILL be parked in. The attendant can move cars that are in your way but it takes a while. Unfortunately, you are chared as part opf yoiur stay and can't choose to park anywhere else without paying for this lot - so that is a drawback. If possible, I would suggest you ditch your car and find a taxi or shuttle from the airport downtown, after that everything is either within walking distance or accesible via streetcar (including Loyola, Tulane, the Aquarium and the Audubon Park Zoo).

I read all the other reviews which gave me high expectations but this hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even come close. The original reservation was for two nights but we ended up staying eight nights until we could go home. Had we known it would be such a long stay we would have checked out much earlier to find a better hotel. Here are the pros: 1. The beds and pillows are comfortable 2. There is a kitchen in every room 3. The director of sales is really helpful and friendly The cons: 1. The A/C compressor makes an awful rattling/buzzing noise every time it runs. Asked to have it looked at three times, no change. Not even a single apology from staff. 2. The refrigerator compressor is very loud, too. 3. Parking is off-site on a wide open surface lot. Walk out the front doors, around the corner, and down and across the street. If you come back at night and that lot is full, the front desk will tell you there's another lot \"over there someplace\" but can't give any more specifics. If you come and go during the weekdays the lot is overflowing with cars double and triple parked. You have to leave your keys with an attendant and then go back to retrieve your keys from him at 6pm. (We left our car parked and walked or took public transportation most of the time so we didn't have to turn our keys over.) 4. The closest decent restaurants are four or five blocks away. Not a big deal because the walk is well lit and seemed relatively secure. 5. The front desk staff is not friendly and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care very much about the guests. If there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t another guest in front of me then I always felt like I was disturbing them from surfing the internet or playing computer games or whatever they were doing so intently on their screens. 6. The first time we extended our stay (I think after the first night) the agent assured me that it was taken care of and our keys would work. The next morning the housekeeper asked what time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be checking out. I stopped at the front desk and, naturally, the stay hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been extended and the staff was terribly inconvenienced by me. 7. The second time I extended the stay (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a glutton for punishment by this point) the agent said there was a note on her computer saying not to extend the reservation. She couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out why the note was there, verified space was available, and extended it. 8. Breakfast was disappointing every day. We tended to go down later in the morning so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any better early on. They were always out of something, whether it was plates, bowls, fresh fruit, utensils, cereal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 always something missing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m no expert but I bet the health department would have an issue with the temperatures maintained on the hot and cold items. Thank God for the waffle maker, we used it every day! Oh, I almost forgot the fruit flies flying around the inside of the bread box. Ick. 9. The pool and hot tub temperatures are both very good but the chemicals are not properly balanced. I sat in the hot tub for a few minutes before the fumes burned my eyes too bad and I had to get out. The pool water changed my swim trunks to a new color. 10. The A/C in the lobby broke down at one point during our stay, they posted signs to let guests know. No big deal, I completely understand that those things happen. However, I think they turn the A/C off in all the public areas and the corridors during the evening hours and weekends when fewer people are around. I guess they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to save a few dollars but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge turn-off for anyone in the lobby, business center, gym, etc. 11. Both towel racks in our bathroom were about to fall off the wall. How could somebody not notice something so obvious and fix it? 12. Nobody (except the awesome director of sales) says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hello\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or anything else. Even the GM doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to like to talk to guests. Out of four times passing by him he only made verbal contact once. Lame. 13. We stopped by the evening reception every time it happened but always ended up leaving to find dinner on our own. The white wine is room temperature and the red wine is empty. The individually wrapped crackers are somehow stale. The evening food has the same temperature and quantity issues as the breakfast. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why it was such a bad experience. Maybe the stars aligned to make it so. If there had just been one or two problems I would be writing a very different review right now.

That was one of the reasons we made reservations there in the first place. We called the hotel directly for reservations and they were just as friendly on the phone. When we arrived I asked for a window facing the front or to the south. The other views did not seem worth having. The front desk clerk said she would take care of it. When we got to the room not only did she take care of my request she also gave us a two bedroom suite with a balcony. It was just me and wife and we only had reserved a one room suite. Very nice. Tuesday evening the manager's reception had roast with potatoes. There was also fresh fruit. Sodas and beer were also available. The roast was very tender. They had a reception Wednesday and Thursday but we ate out so I could not tell you how it was, good I am sure. The hot breakfast was different everyday. Wednesday's breakfast was bacon and eggs and waffles, Thursday's breakfast was sausage and eggs with cinnamon sticks/potatoes. Friday's breakfast was eggs with sausage and pancakes. Saturday's breakfast was eggs and bacon with hash browns. There was also fresh fruit and fresh pastries and cereal everyday in addition to the hot breakfast and orange and apple juice. The room was big and clean. The A/C worked great. It was hot while we were there so that was important. I was worried about the location and our safety because all I heard about post Katrina was the danger of the city. This area was VERY clean, well lit and I felt safe at all times. The parking for this hotel is a self serve parking that is not fenced or covered. There is an attendant during the day but I am not sure in the late evenings since we did not use the car at night. We were in New Orleans for a conference. We were a 15min walk away from the convention center. In the mornings it was pleasant to walk. It was a 9min walk to Harrah's. We went to Harrah's at night and felt very safe walking back to the hotel. The street is well lit and well traveled on. The hotel is one block from the St. Charles Railcar. The first two days we took the railcar to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter. The last day we were there it was just quicker to walk to Bourbon Street. About an 8min walk. Once again that was well lit and a lot of foot traffic so we felt safe as well. Everything we did while there was within walking distance. I only drove the car twice the entire 4 days we were there. We rode the steamboat on the Mississippi and that was only a 15 min walk from the hotel. By the way, parts of Bourbon street closest to Canal had an unpleasant smell but other than that the French Quarter was clean, well lit and safe.

Excellent breakfast (we weren't there for the Manager Evening Meals - Mon through Thur only) with hot choices (the bacon was EXCELLENT), fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, cereal. Alas, no beignets, but it wasn't that far to walk to Cafe Du Monde. The morning of the race, they provided breakfast for all the runners to take with them to the race or to take to their room to eat after the race - bottle of water, juice, fruit, breakfast bars. A very nice thing for them to do. The room was very quiet at night. Check out time was 11AM, but many of the runners, including our group was able to extend that to 1PM without extra cost. Most of their guests arrive for Monday, so they need a bit of extra time to get all the rooms ready. But they were very considerate of the runners. The race goes right past the hotel, so we were able to walk to the start to see our runners take off, then go back to the hotel to see them come back from the French Quarter before the Garden District and then back to the finish line for the half and before they started the second half of the course for the full marathon. Staff was friendly. They offered self parking in a lot next door ($18.02 a night, which wasn't really too bad for NOLA). I was a little worried about the car, but we didn't have any problems.

Also, the hotel's in-door pool and hot tub were a nice touch. Service was wonderful, very friendly staff who also kept the place in spotless condition. The housekeepers did a good job too. A few items however.... On the weekends, its ridiculous to close breakfast at 10am. Let people sleep in and keep the breakfast open for at least another hour, what the big deal? Also, the decor of the rooms, while new, is nauseating. The couch is purplish brown, the wallpaper in the bathroom is like puke green and grey, reminiscient of a hospital waiting room or nursing home. Just awful.

We specifically chose it because it has a true suite set up--bedroom is seperate from the living/kitchen area.

The hotel is very nice--pretty lobby area and breakfast area as well (there's an indoor pool as well). They had our room ready when we checked in 3 hours early, so that was very nice! They also made a point to tell us we could call and ask for a later check out time the following day, if needed. The room had a kitchen/living area with doors leading to the bedroom and bathroom area. We had 2 queen beds and the hotel provided a pack-n-play for our son. The queen beds and pillows were comfortable, and the room was very clean. I found the hotel to be very quiet--we never heard anything from other rooms. It was really great to have doors seperating the bedroom from the living room. That enabled us to stay up later than our son's early bedtime. There were TVs in both the living room and the bedroom. The kitchen had a microwave, refrigerator, toaster, dishwasher, stove, plates, glasses, utensils, and some pots for cooking. It was a really nice set up and they even provided dishwashing cleaner. The frig also had an ice maker. There was a table/desk with 2 chairs, a couch, club chair with ottoman, and coffee table in the living area. I believe the sofa pulled out into a bed as well. The bathroom had the tub/shower and toilet in the back of the room with a door, then the sink and a closet were outside of this. There was no door to seperate the sink area from the beds. This was a great place to go with a small child and allow us all to have some room to spread out. The hotel is in the Central Business District, so it's not in the main tourist area. We did not try walking to the French Quarter since it rained during our stay. Parking can be a pain. You must pay $17.00 to park and the lot is across the street and down the block a bit from the hotel. It gets full quickly and has parking lifts that allow cars to be raised up if the lot fills so that more cars can park underneath. We were there on a Sunday evening, so there was no one attending the lot that evening. It was very difficult to park our small SUV in the lift things and we were very frustrated. Luckily, an attendent for the parking lot company rode by on his bike and took us a few blocks over to park in in the Holiday Inn's lot--which was fenced and had a full time attendent. I felt better about leaving the car there. The hotel staff did not offer information about the parking situation to us at check-in, so my husband had to go back and forth to the lot to put a sticker on the car since no attendent was there when he first parked. Kind of pain in the rain! Overall, I think this was an excellent hotel for families and would be happy to stay there again--clean and spacious rooms are not always the norm in New Orleans.

This was a minor inconvenience, though. We were there during the early Mardi Gras season and were pleased to find that the hotel only two blocks from the St. Charles Street parade route used by most parades. The walk to the French quarter was a bit further --- about 10 minutes. The town is fairly flat, so walking was a pleasure. However, if you need a taxi during Mardi Gras, the proximity to the parade route can cause problems since you have to take a circuitous route (meaning more cost) if there is a parade. And there are two to three parades a day. There weren't many restaurants in the immediate area, but we had planned to dine in the French Quarter anyway, so we weren't really looking at the options around us. Breakfast was plentiful and the selection was good with bacon, sausage, an egg dish, cereals (hot and cold), fruits and breads. The staff went out of their way to be helpful, especially when my father-on-law left his passport somewhere in the room.

Inside on the ground floor it was very nice especially since we were the only ones down there at the time. Be carefull of the hottub before jumping in. It sure seemed really HOT at times. A basic workout room on the second floor (a couple pieces of equiptment but enought for an ok workout). Free use of the business center with computer/internet use. In the end, a great place to stay. If we return next year for the fest, this will be the place to stay. Now for the bad news. Because of Katrina, the hotel is mostly full of people who are staying there while working (getting new and old businesses back up and running). Because of this, their website does tell you that unless you plan on staying 30 days or longer, you probably will not beable to make reservations.

Between us we stayed in two one-bedroom suites and were impressed with how large the suites were. There was plenty of space to spread out and the rooms were immaculate. The kitchen area is fully stocked with flatware, dishes, and cookware if you want to cook your own meals; there is also a large refrigerator (which you will need to store all the leftovers you bring back from the restaurants--there is no such thing as small portions in N.O.), a microwave, and the automatic dishwasher was a nice surprise. The amenities were outstanding as well. The complimentary meals were delicious and there was always a good selection. Coffee and tea service is available 24 hours. I didn't use the pool, but I did take a quick peek and it was a nice sized pool. Also on the premises is a gym, business center, and coin-operated laundry room, all open 24 hours a day. Adjacent to the front desk is a mini convenience store, but prices there are a bit steep as you would expect ($2.25 for a small bottle of apple juice). I would suggest instead going to Walgreens at the corner of Barone and Canal, a 5 minute walk from the hotel. I can't say enough good things about the staff. They were all so friendly and helpful and went above and beyond for us several times. The Homewood Suites is centrally located, with many of the major landmarks (Superdome, French Quarter, Bourbon Street, Harrah's Casino, Riverwalk) no more than a 10 minute walk away. I have just one complaint, and it's a nitpicky one at that. Our balconies did not have chairs, so we were not able to just lounge and get some fresh air.

It did get quite crowded, so on one day there was no seating to be found, and the wait for the 2 elevators was very long.

The very efficient staff stops replenishing at 9:20am, and is clearing the leftovers away by 9:30am. That was a little extreme.

Maybe it's my own fault for not making sure it was locked up, but there wasn't anything there that was really of any great material value... mostly just sentimental reminders of the trip. We managed to replace some of the items, which meant buying them all a second time, but there were a couple of places we weren't able to return to in the time we had left. One of those was the swamp we toured where I had purchased my most treasured shirt of the trip which I never even got to wear! The incident was reported to the Homewood Suites staff, but they were less than helpful. Everyone was very friendly and appeared genuinely concerned, but nothing ever actually got done. The manager kept assuring us that he was looking into it and was going to contact the housekeeper who had been in charge of our room that day but we left more than one person at the desk with cell phone numbers where we could be contacted and never received a single call from them and at the time we checked out, they still had not spokent to the housekeeper. At this point, I am trying to get a response from someone higher up in the company. There are notices in the room stating that, per Louisiana state law, the hotel is not to be held responsible for missing items, but there was also a card that stated that your night's stay is free if you are not 100% satisfied, and I certainly wasn't.
