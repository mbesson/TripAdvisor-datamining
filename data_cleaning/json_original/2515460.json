If you don't want their complimentary breakfast, Coco's and Carl's Junior are 100 yards away (McDonald's is in the next block south). There is a beautifully landscaped pool, the beds are great and each room has a mini-fridge.

Pretty typical fare but they did have some protein options of boiled eggs so that helped.

Price pretty good @ $76. Bed comfortable. Loved having a microwave and mini fridge in the room. Free cable and wi-fi. What I had problems with was the continental breakfast -- the apples had been refrigerated and the boiled eggs as well. Who knows how old the eggs were, as the yolks definitely did not appear to be fresh. The waffles however were ok, freshly made. Also, the room was quite noisy with a worker power washing the building in the morning, however that's just when we were there so it shouldn't be a problem for most travelers. The air conditioner was loud too. I think I would stay again, but just skip the breakfast :)", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cProbably wont go back\u201d", "Author": "ejd729", "ReviewID": "UR115736574", "Content": "Hotel was clean and rates reasonable considering Comic Con in town.

I was there to have dental work done and only needed 2 visits to mexico. But i was charged a clinic rate for the entire week. They don't tell u that the shuttle only drops u off at 7&9am. Pick up must be called by 4pm according to the guy that shuttled me. This guy dropped me off at the wrong clinic the the first day. I spoke to this dark hair (short cut) woman at the front desk who mostly work days. She promised to call me back and speak to me about the problem and the clinic rate especially since I had to hail a cab from the wrong office i was dropped off at in the middle of mexico fearing for my life, but she never bothered to follow up and still charged me the full week rate for the clinic rate.She is very, very, rude. Even on check out she did not bother to ask me how I was paying(because I had cash) instead just charge the credit card I had there to whole the room. She absolutely refused to re due it. This lady who checked me out the morning of 11/24, should not be at the front desk. Her atitude in how she talks to u and looks at u is very unprofessional. The room was nice and clean, the maids were good with keeping the room up. But all of that can go out the window if u have a rude person at the front desk. No, I would not recommend anyone to stay there at least not until they get rid of the lady with dark hair , glasses who works the front desk in the morning mostly and who checked Ms. Hodge out the morning of 11/24/09.

Negatives: -Although we arrived at around 12:30 and the room was already made up, the front desk told us it would be \"about an hour\" until we could move in. (We moved in anyways.) -There was a perpetual smell of raw sewage in the room; especially in the bathroom. Nothing was leaking and we couldn't track it down to a source, but the smell never went away. -The two beds weren't firm enough, and the pillows were too thick. -There was no free shampoo or conditioner; they want you to use a single, unlabeled, wall-mounted soap pump in the shower (like at an auto body shop!) -The cereal dispenser constantly jammed at the continental breakfast.
