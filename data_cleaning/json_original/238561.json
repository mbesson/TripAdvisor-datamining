Rooms were simple but very clean and well appointed, and all the staff were very personable and eager to please, from Mariano, Costello and Alberto at the front desk to those who prepared the breakfast and cleaned the rooms.

My parents, both sisters and their husbands, one set of in-laws, and my wife, daughter and I stayed here last week. Location is amazing because it is a 3 minute walk to the metro, which in Rome will take you close to all the major sights for 1 euro per ride. It's also a nice neighborhood anyway, with good options for lunch where locals go for the price/quality combo. Service was great. No one had any problems with the rooms, but whenever we needed a taxi, or to make reservations for a dinner, Costel and Mariano and the other reception manager were always more than willing to help right away. For me, Costel and Mariano are the best assets to this hotel. We were doing multiple things as a group, and their expertise was absolutely invaluable to the trip. Breakfast was always decent -- nothing to write home about but enough to get you going for the day. Nice pastries, cheese, ham, bread, cappuccino and espresso to order, yogurts, juices, cereals, etc. Rooms were cleaned daily and nicely done. Cleaning staff were always smiling and seemed content. We had a triple, which is quite a bit more room than the double so if space is an issue or you are with a group and want one room as a meeting/communing spot, go for the triple. There are small safes in each room. Personally, I would rate it 5 (excellent) but if I consider the experiences of the whole group I will knock it down to a 4.5 (very good). The only reason I will do that is the noise that tends to come into the rooms at night from the street. The street sweeper vehicles and garbage trucks and mopeds (so frequent in Europe) tend to create some noise, but it mostly ends by midnight. This is not the fault of the hotel, but more of an effect of staying there. Thank you Aberdeen, Costel and Mariano for helping to make our trip to Rome a success!

The location is very quiet. It is across the street from the Ministry of Defense, so lots of security and you feel safe in the area. The building that houses the hotel, has a couple of other hotels in it. When you walk into the main courtyard, Aberdeen is the one on the right up about 8 steps. We had a triple room which was roomy. There is AC. Free Wi-Fi only in the lounge/computer areas. There are 2 PCs in this area also. I remembered breakfast being a bit more personable 10 years ago, with I believe, a relative like grandfather overseeing the room who was very friendly and nice. This time, the staff in the breakfast room seemed a bit brusque and not overly friendly. The breakfast consisted of Rolls, cheese, tea, coffee (from canisters), but you could order cappuccino if you contacted the staff there. Fruits, cereal, yoghurt. The usual European style. The beds were comfortable. The room was clean and the bathroom bigger than a postage stamp. Which means this 6ft tall person could comfortably manage in it. the front desk staff spoke English and were very helpful with directions, maps and suggestions. The area is close to ATMs, the Termini-Train station and a main hub of the subway. One can easily walk to the hotel from the Train station. From the Rome airport (as the Hotel is inside the city walls), there's a set taxi fare from the airport. It's posted at the Taxi stand. 40 Euros for up to 4 people with luggage. Confirm with the Taxi cab driver at the airport that it includes you and your luggage, otherwise they may try to overcharge you. Or alternatively, at your destination only give the 40 Euros. They most likely will try to add on more. Taxis should have the license number on their doors and TAXI on top. If you want, you can take a short train ride from the airport to the Termini station, but if there are more than one in your party, I think the Taxi is better as you get right to the door and can split the tab. We like to walk, and It was easy to walk to sights like the Trevi fountain, Pantheon, Colleseum. We took a taxi to the Vatican, because like before there were 3 of us to split the tab. Of note for snacks or a good take away lunch of pizza there is a place right next to the hotel almost. Just go out the front door, turn left. As you come to the next building, you will see a window that has displayed some of the pizzas etc. 2 doors, Enter the one under the sign Biscotteria Panifici. For 11 Euros 3 of us had a bottle of soda and a huge square of delicious pizza. Priests and workers from the ministry were nonstop coming in for lunch and takeaway. There are a couple of small bar tables there to sit at if not occupied. Make sure NOT to go to the shop across the street on the Defense Ministry side that says snack Bar Gastronomia. The 3 of us had 3 sodas there for 11 euros. Taxis ordered from the hotel arrived in about 2 minutes. We also booked a limousine to the airport when we left at 45 euros.

Hotel is conveniently located near the train, subway, and bus terminals; the room was spacious and clean; breakfast is provided and free wifi is available at lobby. You can leave your luggage with them before and after checkout if it helps with your itinerary. The only complaint we had was the noise level of the room during the night. First off, the walls are quite thin and you can easily hear noises (occasionally conversations) coming from other guests in the hotel. Secondly, our room faces another side street and there were quite a bit of noise coming from there as well even past midnight from people on the street. Finally, our room was located right by the breakfast dining area and the amount of noise coming from there was just unbelievable. Sounds of chatters and the clinging & clanging of dishes were just very irritating and there's nothing we can really about that (we didn't bothered changing room since it was for 2 nights only). There were a few rooms around that area too so I am sure we weren't the only one affected by that. Overall the hotel was great if the noise level can be managed somehow. I would suggest future travelers to request for rooms away from the dining area or if possible, on the first floor as there is no elevator to the second floor.

It is on a quiet side street just off a main road. We mostly booked it b/c it was very close to the metro and main train station. We also found that it was the best choice for our budget and we got a great deal on the price of the room with the Rick Steves discount!! Upon arrival, we were able to check in early, which was welcome after a long overnight flight from NYC. However, we were not happy that there was no elevator and we had to drag our luggage up a long winding staircase. Our room was nice and clean, but a bit on the small side. The bathroom was also very small and the shower (so typical in European hotels) caused a nice little flood every time either of us took a shower b/c the door on the stall didn't close very tightly. Breakfast was included in the price of the room and was modest--it only included some cereal, yogurt, and a variety of breads. I think the most annoying thing about this hotel was that the bed was two twins put together--so needless to say, it was a little hard to get close to your spouse when theres a crack between you! However, unless you are staying in a 4 or 5 star hotel, these minor annoyances re: showers, beds, and breakfast seems to be pretty common in Europe. On a good note, the staff was great and very helpful. We were leaving on a very early morning train on the day of our departure and since we were going to miss breakfast, they put two little care packages of juice, croissants, and dry toast crackers in our room so we would have something to take with us on the train. We also loved the fact that free Wi-Fi in the lobby is available (as well as one shared computer if you do not have your own laptop)--so that is very convenient as well. Overall, I would say if you are on a budget and are looking for a nice, clean place to stay in a pretty convenient location--this is the place for you.

We came only for four days so we had little luggage, two large people with a lot of luggage may find it a bit crowded. After a day the air-conditioner stopped working, and we were given a new room immediately. The two rooms were similar but the first one had a shower and the second a bathtub. The rooms were spotless, and the bed comfortable. The room and bathroom were well lighted, and I loved it because for some reason hotel rooms tend to be dark and gloomy even in expensive and luxurious hotels. The bathroom amenities included soap, a shower cap, shower gel and shampoo, generously replenished every day; there is also a hair dryer in the bathroom but no facial tissues and no body lotion.

We concur. The Hotel Aberdeen is a tourist-class hotel - meaning functional rooms, not a lot of focus on common areas and none of the usual business amenities if you are used to business hotel. (Except, there is free wi-fi downstairs and one computer that guests can share to check on flights, etc.) We can't say enough positive about the staff, including the great woman who works in the breakfast room who remembers after the first day if you want a cappucino with your breakfast. The front desk staff is also very helpful and clearly used to dealing with English-speaking tourists and their varied trials and tribulations. Mariano was especially helpful and patient with us as he used the desk phone to help us try to track down our luggage that never arrived the entire week we were in Rome. Every morning, we spent an hour or so clogging up his lobby on his phone trying to get answers. He even called on our behalf speaking in Italian to the airlines trying to resolve the issue. If you are looking to stay somewhere historic or \"authentically\" Italian, then Hotel Aberdeen is not your choice. You are mostly going to be surrounded by other US, UK, Australian and perhaps Asian guests thumbing through their guidebooks at breakfast. However, the location can't be beat as it is an easy walk from the train station, just around the corner from the Metro and on major bus lines that will take you to the main tourist attractions. Taxi drivers recognized the cross-street intersection which made coming home late at night particularly helpful. Our only warning is to never cease being attentive about your personal safety. The Hotel Aberdeen is on a quiet side street and fronts the National Defense agency. The back of the hotel (where our room was located) is across the street from a major bookstore of Barnes and Noble size. However, during the off-season (January), this street gets pretty quiet. We neglected to notice the locking metal shutters for our window. (They are louvered and will let in fresh air but provide needed security.) As I was too hot in the evening, I opened our window in our second floor room only to catch a person in the act of trying to climb in the open window at 4 am! I yelled, and he fled. But any women traveling alone should be aware of such things. Be aware of your surroundings and notice (as we did not) that everyone keeps their shutters closed or a metal gate pulled down over their windows, no matter on which floor they live. This did not deter us from continuing to stay at the Hotel Aberdeen, as we simply locked our shutters from then on. I never, ever felt unsafe walking on the street, even at night. And the hotel's front entrance is controlled by a buzzer so not just anyone can walk in. An investment in lights or security cameras on the rear of the hotel would seem reasonable. If you are concerned, simply request a room at the front of the hotel or don't open your windows! With this one caveat in mind, I would recommend this choice to others and would definitely consider staying there again.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat home base for exploring Rome\u201d", "Author": "EilisRyan", "ReviewID": "UR94204147", "Content": "I stayed here with my teenage son for a week as part of a tour - so the hotel was selected for us, and it was perfect to use as our home base. Located on a quiet, narrow side street off a more major road near Piazza della Repubblica and the metro, the hotel was a great location for getting around the city. There's a mini-mart and an eatery right next to the hotel and more restaurants and gelaterias just around the corner with long hours -- so you can grab a variety of things to eat at practically any time. The hotel is very simple, but clean and well maintained. It's an older property with marble floors and high ceilings, large windows with interior and exterior shutters (I'll post photos). There are many stairs up to the entrance/ lobby and then again up to the guest rooms -- so I would be cautious if you're traveling with someone who does not do stairs well. There may be an elevator but I don't recall seeing one. Our room was a triple so they removed the third bed after the first night. For three adults, it may have been just a bit cramped but for two, it was more than enough space. It would have been fine for two adults with one child, etc... The beds were very comfortable - which meant a lot after exhausting days walking all over the city. You read a lot about hard European hotel beds but these were very comfy. The bathroom was older as well, but well maintained and clean with plenty of towels. Bring your own face cloth if you use one -- many European hotels do not supply face cloths and neither does this one. All the staff were very friendly and helpful -- You leave your key at the front desk whenever you go out of the hotel, and I found it interesting that they remembered each person by name and your room number each time you returned. It made you feel like they really cared that you were their guest. Breakfast was included each day -- cereal, pastries, juices, delicious yogurt, coffee (fyi - don't expect to find decaf anywhere in Italy :-). The room where breakfast is served was also a nice size. The common room nearest our room had a public computer with free internet access and wireless if you had your own laptop which was great.

The taxi arrived right on time so we didn't have any problems getting out. The rate was also economical compared to other hotels I evaluated in my planning. While the hotel is not close to any tourist attractions, it is well located near the Metro stop. We easily navigated the train system to all of the important landmarks using the map they gave us. We bought our tickets at the little kiosk across from the stop. There was a very good restaurant right behind the hotel in a quiet alley but I can't remember the name! Be sure to ask at the desk as the other restaurants around there aren't very good. There are two McDonalds very close for a quick snack or lunch if you're homesick. Overall, our stay at this hotel was average. If we were to go back to Rome, I would look for something more centrally located. Location (unless you want to be close to the train station--then it's a fine choice) is the major reason that I wouldn't recommend it.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "port orange, FL", "Title": "\u201cClean, but definitely spartan, nice location\u201d", "Author": "darkstar388", "ReviewID": "UR85767695", "Content": "Ask for a quiet room, away from the breakfast room, which can be very noisy in the morning until noon.

Had chosen the Hotel Aberdeen due to positive Tripadvisor and Rick Steves reviews. We were not disappointed. The location was an easy 15 minute walk from Termini Station, and we got to partake of beautiful Plaza Republica along the way. Note that we are walkers, hence we found that all major historical, shopping, and restaurants were walkable for us.Perhaps not for everyone. We did partake of the user-friendly and clean Metro to visit the Vatican. We also used the bus system a few times, which was also easy, handy, and just 1Euro per trip. As had been promised, the staff at Aberdeen was extremely helpful and gracious at all times. Our room, while not qualifying as luxurious, was very clean and comfortable. The bath was excellent and stocked with toiletry amenities. Housekeeping did a great job as well. Breakfast was well served in a spotless and inviting inside dining room. We were well satisfied with the adequate offerings, and loved the strong Italian coffee. The only downside whatsoever to our stay was street noise, as Rome is a loud place. Personally, I prefer to accept the noise in exchange for our cool streetside window. Otherwise, you may wish to ask for an inside room. We feel the right hotel choice can play a big part in the overall enjoyment of the travel experience. We are glad we researched and chose Aberdeen. Our Rome visit was unforgettable, and Aberdeen did their very positive part. We found an excellent value and without hesitation highly recommend the Aberdeen Hotel.

The room had a bowl of moldy/soft fruit that I threw in the garbage immediately. The TV is very small and outdated. The CNN station was going to be taken off the air/satellite and we were reminded of this every 30 minutes while trying to watch a program in English. The walls are incredibly paper thin to the point where we could here the people in the next room taking a shower, brushing their teeth and using the 1970's model hairdryer. I had to yell quiet and the people actually heard me say that! We also heard the pipes between the walls when the water would be turned on and off. The breakfast being prepared in the morning (6:30 am) with the carts rolling down the loud hallways made it absolutely impossible to sleep in. Glasses and plates being moved around in the breakfast room only made things worse. When the room next to ours was being cleaned, our toilet would make noises when the toilet next door was being plunged/cleaned. The hallways echo with people talking and you get to look forward to the trash being emptied at 2:30 am!! This along with the car alarms that go off in the middle of the night will only ensure that you will get zero sleep! For Rick Steves to actually recommend this hotel is insane (or he is)!!

Since we ended up being up from 2:30 am on, we booked another hotel for the remainder of our stay and have asked for a refund from the hotel.

Also, it's only a 5-10 minute walk to Termini train station, so I'm not sure why some of the other reviewers chose to take a cab to the train station (unless they had a huge load of luggage or broke their foot which would make staying at this hotel disadvantageous indeed as there is no elevator). None of the members on my tour had problems getting their cabs to the airport, and one cab even stopped at this hotel and another down the road to pick up a friend without any issues. The front desk staff was friendly and the breakfast was decent. The breakfast attendant was perhaps a little bit grumpy, but she did her job and took coffee orders, so no complaints.

The hotel offered to arrange a flat rate driver to pick us up from the airport which we were glad we took advantage of. The driver was waiting on our arrival with a sign. He didn't speak English but had the address on a bit of paper which he showed us and we nodded that it was correct. So off we went at dawn on a beautiful day into Rome and he took us right there and we didn't have to worry about haggling over price or trying to find the hotel which was good as my husband was sick when we arrived. The staff at this hotel are great and all spoke English and after exploring the city we felt it was one of the best locations we could have had. Central and on a quiet street across from the ministry of defence and just a block from Via Nazionale and tons of shops and restaurants and within walking distance to Termini Station. We loved it. Our room was tiny but spotless with big windows overlooking the quiet side street. It was a beautiful old heritage building. There was air-conditioning, shutters and modern sound reducing windows. The bathroom was spotless and beautifully tiled in lemon and white. The continental breakfast was very good yet simple. Great yoghurts, fresh pastries, and my only complaint would be that without any doubt at all it had the absolute worst tasting coffee I've ever had, consistently each day, which was the last thing I expected to complain about in Italy. But there are great places to get good coffees all around so don't despair. I found it amusing more than anything that coffee in Italy could be that bad. Our flight arrived at 7am and we went straight to the hotel and not only were they kind enough to let us check straight in to our room but they offered us to enjoy the free breakfast going on which we were not really entitled to until the next day. So that was much appreciated. There are many great side-streets off Via Nazionale where you can get eat like the locals. We walked straight down Nazionale to Dei Serpenti and turned left and at the end of the street you can see the Colosseum looming so we just walked there and enjoyed the street life along the way in very safe areas. The hotel had a lovely internet room to use and another little room off that to sit and read.

The room was extremely dusty and this did not change during our stay. We had to request soap and hand towels.

The location, as mentioned in previous reviews, is conveniently located so that the Colosseum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, many ristorantes and pizzerias, shops etc are within walking distance. But if you prefer not to walk, then you can easily take the metro, which is 5 minutes away and costs 1 euro per person for any commute within an hour and a half. We took the metro to get to the Vatican Museum/Sistine Chapel, walked in to a ticket counter to reserve a spot for a guided tour, which started within 20 minutes. Doing the Museum first has the added benefit of being able to take a short cut to St. Peter's Basilica if you take the exit on the right hand side as you exit the SIstine Chapel... no long queues a second time around! ( The left exit takes you back to the Museum's entrance/ lobby/gift shop) We enjoyed the staff immensely - Thank you to Sabrina, Mariano and Alberto who were extremely helpful and accomodating in making recommendations for dinner (rather daunting as we were a fairly large group of 11), then calling to make the reservation for us. They also took care of airport pick-up and drop-off, and transportation to the cruise ship as well as picking us up. They kindly let us leave suitcases we did not need after the cruise was over, so we could continue our land tour of Italy for another week more \"streamlined\" and less encumbered since we were returning to stay the night before our flight back to the US. One other thing I'd like to note from a parent's point of view is that we are always conscious of how hotel staff react to a group that has 5 adults, 3 children and 3 young teenagers, and I commend the Hotel Aberdeen for their welcoming attitude, cheerful \"Ciao!\"s to the kids, patience with providing keys after getting locked out of our rooms,etc. Very family friendly if you happen to be traveling with kids.

Traveling in Europe is pricey, but staying at the Hotel Aberdeen took the sting out of the cost of meals and many gelatos that we so enjoyed and consider one of the most important aspects of traveling in any country. This is a Rick Steve's endorsed hotel, and his tour groups do stay here, so you know how HE feels about this place if he puts his name to it! Breakfast was filling and satisfying with varieties of pastries, cereals/ granolas and chilled yogurts (very nice after having our fill of room temperature yogurts throughout Italy) and fruits, and brewed coffee you could help yourself to. The staff however gladly served you a cappucino, latte, or expresso... whatever you wanted, they were happy to make it to order. The free internet was greatly appreciated by our group (especially my teenage son who was thrilled he could check his Facebook account each day). They have one computer for use, but if you have your laptop, or iphone, there is a password they give you so you can get wireless connection in one of two areas on the first floor. Although not luxurious, the guest rooms are clean, comfortably furnished, air-conditioned, towels and sheets changed each day. One wonderful addition that the management might want to consider would be a mini-fridge... it is VERY HOT in Rome in July and August, and we were constantly buying waters and other drinks at the small neighborhood markets. That is the only thing I can think of that would have made this stay a perfect \"10\", but all in all, our group was very happy with the Hotel Aberdeen and would without a doubt stay here again. Mille Grazie for your warm hospitality from your Californian friends...until our next visit to Roma!!", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, California", "Title": "\u201cClean place and a good value\u201d", "Author": "susanm3320", "ReviewID": "UR36733670", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Aberdeen Hotel for one night in June of 2009 before leaving on a cruise to Greece and Turkey.

The rooms had beds, desk, one chair TV with remote and private bath. There was a USB port, so I assume there was in room internet, but we didn't bring a laptop to try it. There was a computer area off the lobby which had a public computer and USB ports for laptops.

Breakfast is served from 7 am till 10 am and has juice, coffee, pastries, cereal,yogurt, ham and cheese. There is one staff member setting up food and clearing tables. They will make cappuccino for you as well. Perhaps the best thing about the hotel was proximity to Termini train station and the METRO. We took the Da Vinci express train from the airport to Termini and then walked to our hotel - less than 10 minutes. The Republicca METRO station is literally three blocks away. The main bus lines (40, 64, and H) pass 2 blocks from the hotel, but are often packed - if you walk a litle further to the Termini Station where the busses originate you will always get a seat on an empty bus which is what we did. A snack bar, alimentary , pizza store and McDonalds are within a block, There are good restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel, but for us the more memorable restaurants were in the older part of town near the Pantheon or in Traveste which are accessible by transit. It is definitely walkable to go to the Spanish stairs or Trevi fountain from the hotel and we did that a number of times, but it is a bit of a walk. We booked fairly far ahead of time and reserved a quad room for myself, my wife and 2 kids. When we booked the room I thought we got a very good price. For whatever reason, the quad was not available and they gave us two rooms at the price of the quad room we had reserved which I thought was great. We will definitely return to this hotel!", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "kathleenkr", "ReviewID": "UR26857697", "Content": "As a solo traveler going to Rome for the first time, I spent hours and hours preparing for this trip.

On this basis I booked it straight away due to the cost. (Check the main travel comparison sites for prices, you can uncover some great bargains) Me and my girlfriend have just returned from a great trip in Rome and this is my experience of the Aberdeen Hotel:- LOCATION AND TRANSPORTATION LINKS:- Firstly I wanted a hotel in the centre of Rome so that most things were walkable or accessible by public transport, the Aberdeen Hotel is perfect for this as its around the corner from the nearest metro station (Reppublica) and about 5-10 minutes walk from the Termini station and main bus station. There are also bus stops down the road on Via Nazionale (the nearby main road). I didnt anticipate getting a bus when I was there however they are so easy to use and actually quite fun plus you get to see a lot of things en-route. (There is never nothing to see in Rome!). All public transport is dirt cheap aswell, check out the ticket options you have at the ticket machines or local vendors (its only \u20ac4 euros for a day pass which lets you travel on all metro, bus or tram services! \u20ac11 for 3 days or just \u20ac1 for a ticket valid for 75 minutes) THE HOTEL:- The hotel itself is very clean and bright, and as its family run its more of a touristic hotel rather than corporate which is good for young couples like us. You get the small family run feel as you walk through the front door. The staff are all very welcoming and friendly, for example when we checked in the receptionist gave us a map and circled areas of interest and also advised on how far they where if walking or what public transport to get to them, the map is excellent with extreme detail and any questions you have they can answer. The breakfast is adequate mainly comprising of cold meats and cheese, croissants, cereals, fruits, yogurts, tea, coffee and juices plus little additions here and there on different mornings. The hotel internet is free however they only have 1 PC so can be quite difficult to get on especially at busier times i.e. weekends. We had no problem until a group of young Americans turned up then you could never get on it due to their facebook obsessions!! however if your on business and have your own laptop then they do have a seperate ethernet cable for your own usage, to quash the problem of having to wait. The hotel is staffed 24 hours so returning late after a session is not a problem!! THE ROOMS:- Our room (33) was a reasonable size, the bathroom was very spacious and the bed was comfortable and plenty big enough. The room has your usual i.e. tv and wardrobe/chest of drawers, hangers, plus a free safe, a minibar, and window shutters to blank out light if you fancy a siesta in the day, but also great to control the amount of light let into your room if you like sleeping in total darkness. The floor is marble (Romans like marble!) and the decor is nice, quite homely making it easy to relax. It was cleaned and tidied daily and always very nice to come back to after a long day walking. There really wasnt anything to complain about but if i HAD to grumble about anything, it would probably be about some of the outside noise. I seem to get woken up by any slight noises so maybe im an exception, but now and again you can hear the odd motorbike grumble and sirens going off and late night session folks returning back but my conclusion was you are in a city centre so you have to expect it. The aircon is good so if you shut the windows fully you can blank it out well and it is not enough to keep you awake all night, I just found it a little more difficult to fall asleep then i normally would thats all, but if you are a better sleeper than me then you wont have a problem (aka my girlfriend who snores her head off after 5 minutes). The bed did comprise of 2 single beds stuck together, but you couldnt notice this really and im sure this isnt the case in all rooms. All in all a very pleasent hotel which i recommend highly, a must if you get a good rate. Some tips on Rome itself would be:- when visting the Colleseum do a tour of it, some also include the Roman Forum aswell. Its just you get told what you are looking along with the history of the place plus you get to skip queues!! it makes for an overall more memorable experience. Also do a tour of the Vatican i.e. St Peters Basillica and the Vatican museum/Sistine Chapel. Im not a great art lover but seriously it doesnt matter, this place will blow you away! but it you do an official tour with a guide, you will know what you are looking at and get the full history! it really is worth paying the little bit extra plus again...no queues!! (this is coming from the tightest bloke you will ever meet!). With regards to eating and drinking, DONT eat on the main Piazza's as the restaurants are not as good as the ones down the side streets and are overpriced, also restaurants that are busy with locals are always reliable, but venture down to Travestere around the streets of The Piazza Santa Maria as some of the best restaurants and bars are located in this area. Testaccio is also a good place to go drinking or clubbing.

So I just wanted to share my experience with you all..... so it may help you decide. Firstly , what a great location hotel Aberdeen is . Its very near the metro Republica about 3mins walk. Bars, restaurants, clothes shops all in few minute walking distance from the hotel. You can walk to most of the attractions from the hotel also but seeing as the Metro is so close, cheap and very easy to use we used that everyday. The actual hotel was very impressive to look at. I liked the fact that it only has 35 rooms in the hotel so it had more of a personal feel to it. The staff were fantastic, so friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for them. They recommened some excellent local restaurants for us to eat in. The actual rooms were lovely and large with nice paintings on the walls. The bathroom was big , with a very powerful hot shower. The rooms were very clean and lovely and warm for us in January! There was plenty of breakfast on the go, breads, cheese cereal, pastries, fruits etc. A good to start the day before sightseeing. Everyone has focused in these reviews on the breakfast room. The only thing I would say is that where it is located you have to walk past a couple of peoples rooms in the morning so it may be a bit noisier for those staying in them , but it you are getting up early for breakfast to go sightseeing then it wouldnt affect you at all. Bear in mind the main bulk of the rooms are on the complete opposite side of the hotel, so you could always ask for a room on the opposite side. Overall the hotel was excellent value for money and in a great location to go sightseeing in. I highly reccommend it so please do not overlook this beautiful little hotel.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cAmazing stay\u201d", "Author": "Bon_voyage13", "ReviewID": "UR23779658", "Content": "We stayed at Aberdeen Hotel on our last leg of our European tour and we definitely saved the best till last!

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and will definitely stay here when I return to Rome. I arranged a stay a day earlier than the tour and booked directly with the hotel via email. Mariano was wonderful and patiently answered all my questions prior to my arrival. I utilzed their airport pick-up and drop-off service which was about what a cab ride would have cost and it was money well spent for the peace of mind since I was traveling alone. LOCATION: As other reviewers have noted the location of the hotel couldn't be beat! The hotel is right around the corner from the metro and bus station. Places to eat were in short distance (next door, across the street, around the corner)! The Tabacco shop to get metro/bus tickets was a few doors down and the hotel is right off Nazionale - a MAJOR street with lots of eating options and shops. And.... the majority of the major sights are within walking distance if you don't want to take the bus/metro. STAFF: The location alone is reason to stay at Hotel Aberdeen but the hospitality of the hotel is why I would return. Sabrina and Mariano were the hotel receptionists the majority of the time and they were the best!! Be sure to ask them about dinner options! They have a variety of suggestions right in the neighborhood. The bedroom and breakfast room attendants were all very friendly and accommodating. ROOM: My first night I was in a single and then moved to a double when the tour started. I loved both rooms...very European! The single room was in the vicinity of the kitchen so as others have said it's a great wake up call if you need to be up at 5:30 am... but will be problematic if you were hoping to sleep in. The double room was located right across the hallway but was in an enclave so I barely heard the kitchen noise. BREAKFAST: I enjoyed the breakfasts: croissants, pastries, ham, rolls, cereals, fruit, granola, american coffee, juices, and cappuchinos! Italians customarily eat later than we do in the U.S. (arriving to dinner at 8pm or later) therefore breakfasts are lighter and lunch is heavier. MISC: -heated towel bars in bathrooms very nice! -Right around the corner is a late night internet cafe that sells international phone cards. 200 minutes for 5 euros!! Can use them to call the US from your hotel room with no additional charge! No need to mess with cell phones, SIM cards, etc. -a free computer/internet access in the hotel -at the end of the street is a mcdonalds if you need to grab a cup of american coffee after the breakfast room closes. OVERALL QUALITY: In the US I am a Sofitel, Westin, Hyatt, Omni hotel gal. But overseas I like to stay in local establishments. Hotel Aberdeen is a small, quaint, \"inn\" type hotel that had a wonderful local flavor to it.

Everyone was extremely helpful, with recommendations for restaurants, tours etc. The room on our first stay, though not overly spacious, was fine for the 3 of us. The bathroom was large and had a tub (Hooray). We were down the hall from the breakfast room but the noise that other reviewers complained about did not bother us. The sound of the cappucino machine was a pleasant wake-up call. The breakfast was fine and normal for Italian hotels. My wife and daughter loved the rolls. Suggest you ask for the cappucino instead of drinking the coffee. When we checked out to spend a few days in Florence I was able to leave one of my suitcases at he hotel. It was locked in a storage room and safe. Just another convenient service of the hotel. On our return we were given a very spacious room. I had a rental car this time and Silvia filled out the paperwork so I would not get fined for driving in a NTZ (no traffic zone). She then got directons for me to the nearest Avis so I could return the car. That last night my wife got food poisoning from a restaurant in Piazza Navona (not recommended by the hotel). She was pretty sick most of the night. Silvia directed me to a pharmacy and then cut a lemon from a tree in the back for a home remedy. Where else would you get this kind of help? I don't recommend that restaurant. Can't remember the name but when you enter the Piazza from the east (Pantheon) turn right and it will be the second restaurant. It starts with a \"P\". Food was overpriced and they tried to con you into leaving an extra tip by telling you the service charge on the bill was tax not gratuity. Most expensive meal we had on entire trip and the worst. IF you do want to eat at Piazza Navona then go to Tre Scalini on the west side. A little pricey too but good food and great view. The location of the hotel is convenient to most attractions. If your prefer a taxi the desk clerk will call one for you. It only takes 3 minutes to get a taxi. Being on the same street as the Ministry of Defense it is pretty safe.

The rooms were comfortable and had everything you would need--perfect for those who plan to spend their days exploring the city and just need a comfortable place to lie their heads at night. You can also find GREAT deals through their website; in early March I paid 90 euro per night (including weekend) for a large double room with two beds...a fantastic deal! One major negative for me was the lobby and computer area, which smelled very smoky all day and all night. Maybe that is the price you pay for non-smoking rooms in Rome these days (EVERYONE smokes EVERYWHERE), but with a covered courtyard, I think this could have been better. Speaking of the courtyard, that is one of the greatest charms of this otherwise average hotel. The outside and inside both let you know that this building has been around since the 1800s, although the rooms and hotel areas do not feel old or outdated. Although the staff as a whole offers a great experience, don't expect to get to know the people who work there as you might in other hotels. Whether day or night, the person at the front desk will probably change each day. The breakfast host was consistent during my stay, and he was courteous and helpful. On the whole, I would rate this as an average experience, lacking and stand-out features. However the price, safety (close to the Termini station, but across the street from the city's police guard headquarters), and location--3 minutes walking to the closest metro and no more than 20 to most major sights--make it a great deal for the non-fussy, or for those traveling on a budget .

The next morning the kind lady at the front desk inquired as to how I was doing, as she had been informed of my problem by the night person. The only drawback I found was I felt the bed was very hard. However, after reading other reviews for other hotels in Rome, I guess this is a common condition...

The room had obviously not been refurbished, and it smelled funny because, as we soon discovered, the ceiling in the bathroom was covered in mold.

A little gem.\u201d", "Author": "Riverblue", "ReviewID": "UR8699501", "Content": "My wife and I flew Ryan Air from Liverpool to Ciampino with no problems, once there I dithered on Taxi or Bus and chose the bus, 6 euros each and right to the Termini no problems at all and plenty of seats and a direct service, we walked from the Termini to the Aberdeen if you stay here mail the hotel for directions from Termini Station which is only 10 minutes away with your cases in tow, nowhere in Rome has big signs indicating shops, hotels etc so not a bad idea to get directions wherever you are staying. The Aberdeen is a great little hotel in a quiet street off one of Rome\u2019s major roads, Via Nationale. Very safe place to stay with smallish rooms but space enough to move around comfortably, very clean and friendly not much more you can ask for in a capital city. They don\u2019t have much of a communal area and no bar (they do have a fridge bar in the room though which is handy) so meeting other guests is confined to breakfast which is served between 7 and 10 am. Breakfast is typical continental fayre. We couldn\u2019t keep the room on our last day as they are very busy and needed the room but, they do have a small lounge and a washroom which they are happy for you to use, bags are kept in a safe place for late departures from the hotel. The location is quite good, far enough away from the dodgy Termini Station (Make sure any stay in Rome is away from the Termini area) and in walking distance of all the sites or if you prefer, Via Nationale has buses and the Metro just 1 minute away from the hotel, take care on the busses, I read a lot of reviews before I went about security in Rome and theft etc. I must say they were a bit of a worry but to be honest all a bit over the top. Rome is a major European City and has the same problems as all major cities but Rome has more Police on the streets than any place I have ever been, incidentally the Aberdeen is opposite the police headquarters and in the same district as some other military and police buildings including Quinerale the Presidential palace so, sleep well. Just make sure you keep valuables and wallets out of site take extra care on the busses and crowds and you won\u2019t have a problem, I tend to leave my wallet in the hotel safe (which was in the room and was free) and just take enough cash for the day in my pocket. Pick pockets tend to look for tell tale signs such as wallet shaped bulges so eliminate the risk. We didn't see any problems and I would encourage you to walk everywhere in Rome as you will stumble on more sights and will give you a feel for the city. After 5 days though you may need a new pair of feet. The streets and roads immediately around the Aberdeen are busy with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants but to be honest we didn't find a decent restaurant or bar in the area and found better restaurants on our next to last day near Piazza Navona (typical). Now Piazza Navona has a lot of restaurants too and they range from 15-20 Euros to 30-40 Euros per meal but they all seemed to be the same Tourist type foods i.e. not very appealing and even less appetising so my advice is by all means spend time in Piazza Navona have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere but stay away from the major roads and piazza's and eat just outside Piazza Navona in the quiet streets where you will find better food at reasonable cost. Rome is an expensive city; it was between 5 and 8 euros for a medium sized beer so definitely not a drinking destination, obviously we didn't get around all dining area's so it will be a bit of hit and miss if you are staying in another area but you will probably find the same applies in other area's and the better food will be served off the main tracks. Overall a great stay in Rome and the Aberdeen Hotel was a little gem. One other tip, Take a guided tour of the Vatican we did the Vatican twice, once on our own and again with a guide and I cant recommend the guided tours enough, you will miss all kinds without one, it cost 25 euros each plus the cost of the Vatican ticket 13 euros but best money we spent.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longwood , Florida", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "gmim", "ReviewID": "UR8489457", "Content": "August 23, 2007 gim Orlando, Florida We stayed for 3 days.

While I feel many reviewers of this hotel get a little carried away, there are some things that set Aberdeen apart from other Euro hotels. Read on for the GREAT, the GOOD, the BAD, and the UGLY. I will offer some 'bottom line' recommendations at the end also. Here goes . . . GREAT: # 1 - I encountered nothing but friendly and eager-to-help employees at Aberdeen. From 'hellos' to being eager to share Rome tips, the employees at Aberdeen make a big difference. I'm generally not used to encountering congenial employees in Euro hotels - I am used to having my [--] kissed in business class hotels here in the U.S., but it doesn't always seem 'sincere'. At Aberdeen, they WANT to help. Stop reading here and you've already discovered why so many guests of this hotel like it so much. # 2 - Location (part 1) - Aberdeen is nicely located minutes from Termini and major sites, but it sits on quiet Via Firenze - a side street that escapes the noise of Via Nationale. You'll have excellent access to buses, trains, and be a relative close walk to some major points of interest. GOOD # 1 - The in-house breakfast is nicer than other Euro hotels I've stayed in. You will be served by friendly employees that will help you get off to a good start. # 2 - It was helpful to me to be able to keep in touch w/ work on e-mail. They have a terminal or two whereby you can check e-mail at no charge in the lobby. BAD (or 'room for improvement') # 1 - The rooms are clean and nice but don't come expecting to be spoiled. If you're traveling with someone, you'd better not be opposed to getting thisclose. Luckily, I was with someone I love to get thisclose with. Like most Eurotels, expect a cramped bathroom and no frills - and you'll be fine. # 2 - Because of the nice marble floors in the rooms and hallways, expect a lot of 'background noise'. You'll hear other guests and clanging dishes from the dining room. # 3 - All of the guestrooms are on the second floor and there's no elevator. No big deal. I'm a jock and you expect a euro trip to be physical but, again, don't come looking for luxury. UGLY Nothing ugly to report. BOTTOM LINE / RECOMMENDATIONS: # 1 - The Aberdeen is a good choice as a 'tourist class' hotel. Calibrate your expectations accordingly and you'll be pleased - like most of us who have posted reviews here. # 2 - Unlike most, I DO not recommend the trendy little Target restaurant around the corner. The best Italian restauants feel very 'family owned'. Don't get me wrong, I did not dislike Target, I just feel you can do better by going more casual and less trendy (although the food in Rome was disappointing in general compared to other areas of Italy) # 3 - (important!!) If arriving by Termini - and chances are you are - DO NOT take a cab to this hotel!!! It is a seven minute walk thru an area that looks more dangerous than it is. I was quoted a rate of 40 euro at the station by a driver! I'm very happy I declined. In fact, on the way back I looked for that driver. Good thing for him I didn't see him again.

The hotel is fantastically located being just 2 mins walk from the Metro at Republica and another 5 mins from Termini. We found the breakfast a bit basic compared to other hotels we have stayed at and found that there wasn't a lot of choice left after 9-9:30 so I'd advise getting in there a bit earlier. We also had breakfast at the George Byron cafe on the corner of Via Nazionale and the omlettes were delicious and good value. The snack bar opposite the hotel also does very good cheap coffees and is open until late at night. The staff are friendly and helpful telling you how to get to the sights easily and quickly and generally spoke good english. They really came into their own however when one of our party found that he'd lost his family's passports as we were leaving for the airport. We were at the airport trying to arrange something with BA when the receptionist from the Aberdeen rang his mobile saying that they'd found the passports in the room safe and had already sent them in a taxi to the airport. What fantatstic service this was and to top it all they didn't charge us for the taxi as they said the chambermaid should have checked the safe when the room was vacated!

The location can't be beat for convenience (easily walkable and easy to find from the Termini Stazione, very close to bus and metro, walking distance to Ancient Rome, and a lovely, friendly little shop across the street for bottled water, croissants, sandwiches, etc. which I miss already). All of the people who work at this hotel are warm, friendly and helpful. Our room was beautifully done, huge, airy and sparkling clean. We had a room facing the street and some may not like the hustle and bustle noise at times, but I loved it. It's off the main drag, but does get some traffic. It was unseasonably warm there in January and we opened the shutters and window to take in the sounds of Rome (along with a little fresh air). With the shutters and windows closed, much of the outside noise was blocked out, for those who prefer quiet. The included breakfast was very well done too. I can't recommend Hotel Aberdeen strongly enough. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Rome.

Instead of posting my life story, I will round up how we found the hotel: Location - The street of the hotel - Via Firenze - connects with two main roads full of shops, cafes and even theatres - Via Settembre and Via Nazionale. These two main roads connect to a maze of interconnecting streets that will get you anywhere you want to go in under 30 minutes on foot. It is a safe, clean and friendly area and there are bus stops on Nazionale and Settembre. A good, if not totally perfect base from which to explore the city. Trevi fountain/Pantheon - 10 min walk Spanish steps - 10 min walk Colloseum - 10 min walk Vatican - 25 minute walk Hotel - The hotel is difficult to sport at first - its just a door with two or three intercoms and brass plates with the names of two or three hotels on it. Situated on a mini courner in half way up the road, just set back slightly in the main street. Hygien - Very clean, we only stayed for two days and the room was cleaned and towels changed during our stay. Services/features - Free internet use - they havce two computers you can use for free at any time - free electronic safe in the room, mini bar. Mini bar was VERY REASONABLE compared to English hotels and it was a huge relief when we got the bill. 9 euros for two mineral waters and two cans of lager - in England mini bar prices could have made it about \u00a320. Noise - Our room was mostly quiet but as it was on the bottom floor and at the back of the hotel, it could get a bit niosy with vespas zooming past and cars beeping now and again. Not too bad on the whole and it didnt wake us up. Staff - Top notch staff who were very friendly and always approachable. All reception staff spoke great English and one actually was English, so it was easy to communicate. They gave us a free map of Rome and wrote on routes to the tourist sights etc, which they didnt have to do. Receptionist came in to show me how to use the safe - was very friendly and didnt make me feel like an imbecile for not working it our myself. Breakfast/food - We stayed on a B&B basis. Breakfast was fine - decent quality but not too much choice. There were three cereals, croissants, bread rolls, ham, cheese and yoghurts. Coffee, tea, OJ, pineapple juice and water were there too, along with milk. I've had a lot better but it was fine, a decent start to the day. Overall - I'd definately stay there again, good location, great staff, clean friendly and safe environment. It wasnt luxury but it wasnt hardship either.

I have stayed in a few 2-3 star hotels, but have spent literally hundreds of nights in 4-5 star, and maybe only 20-30 in 3 star. Unfortunately in Rome my budget did not extend to 4-5 star, so I 'slummed it' in what I figured was the best 3 star option. Overall, I think the Aberdeen is exceptional value for money, with a great location and price. But there are some issues. Room: I was in a single room and can confirm that it was officially the smallest room I have ever seen. Just one single bed, a tiny closet, TV stand and about 5 square feet of spare floor space for bags. There was no where to store my bag so I just had it on the floor, soaking up about all the spare space. The room was well decorated and spotlessly clean. There was no view (except of a brick wall), but the rooms at the front of the hotel would have a nice view of Via Firenze. Overall, the room was barely comfortable. If you plan on spending any time in your room (e.g. watching TV or reading a book) you will be pretty miserable. Bathroom: The real low point was the bathroom. It was tiny (as expected) with a corner shower, toilet, bidet and sink. The big problem was the shower would spray water in all directions except where you want it to go. On top of that, it would make an extremely loud high-pitched noise which was painful to the ears. The end result is that you are in a shower that sprays water everywhere like on the walls and floor, and you have a headache from the high pitched deafening noise. Not impressed. Noise: This is my biggest problem with the Aberdeen. There must be almost no noise insulataion at this hotel. From my room I coul hear the goings-on in nearby rooms without any difficulty (including at night...). I could hear the footsteps and conversations from people walking up the hallway. I could hear the gate at the front of the hotel open and close throughout the night. I was kept awake until well past midnight each night due to the noise (guests arriving back at the hotel). I would be woken at around 6am from guests leaving the hotel early, or heading down to breakfast. I should point out that I am a very light sleeper. I chatted with others in the hotel who said they did not think the noise was a problem. But for me it was. I spent 6 nights there, and did not get more than 5 hours decent sleep on any one night. Staff: The big plus for the hotel is the staff who are FANTASTIC, and will do everything they can to help with your visit. They are so friendly, and really make the hotel. I cannot emphasise enough how great everyone at the front desk is. Breakfast: A basic breakfast is served each morning consisting of croissants, rolls, ham, cheese, cereal, yoghurt and juices. Coffee is available but if you are smart you will ask the attendant to make you a cappucino (which they will, but you have to ask). Entertainment: There are two internet terminals near the lobby which are very useful and free. It appears to be a high-speed connection. The TV in the room has like 60 channels but the only one in English is CNN. Location: The Abderdeen's location is excellent. There are heaps of shops and restaurants near-by and the area felt very safe. I walked everywhere I had to without much difficulty. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the Colloseum/Forum, and about 15mins to Piazza Venezzia. The other BIG benefit with the location is the Republica subway station is only about 500 feet from the hotel. The subway is a great way to get across Rome. There are also buses operating about 300 feet from the hotel. So overall, the location is great. BUT, to be honest, I would have preferred a location around Piazza Venezia, which I think is the true heart of the city. Conclusion: For the money I paid (about US$130/night) the Aberdeen was exceptional value for money - given the high cost of Rome's hotels. The staff and location are what make this a great place. The problem with the bathroom is no doubt limited to my specific room - and to be fair - I never complained about it. I am sure if I had, the staff would have fixed the problem ASAP. However, I would probably not stay at the Abderdeen again due to the noise problems. Also, I would probably rather spend a bit more money and stay at a 4 star hotel closer to Piazza Venezia, which would give me a larger room and better location. However, if you are not a light sleeper, the Aberdeen is exceptional value and I would highly recommend it!", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, Best in Rome for the Price\u201d", "Author": "MarkLaurence", "ReviewID": "UR5730685", "Content": "I have just finished a four day stay in Rome at the Aberdeen Hotel and having been to Rome four times previously this is the best place I have stayed by far.

Reception provided maps and explained where everything was which was extremely helpful. We found that most places of interest were about a 20 minute walk away from the hotel although there were plenty of local buses and metros to use.

We will definetly use this hotel again on our next trip to Rome, it offers value for money especially with the expensive hotels in Rome, it is central , clean and staff are helpful.", "Date": "May 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201csafe, convenient location, helpful staff, clean\u201d", "Author": "cvillecouple", "ReviewID": "UR5009053", "Content": "This hotel is way above average for the price!

This was a major plus after a long flight from the states. No need to worry over trains or busses, just walk about 10 min, and you can relax! When we arrived at 10:00 am, the front desk held our bags until our room was ready, around 11:00 am. It was wonderful being able to shed the bags and enjoy a stroll around Rome. Once we checked in, the friendly lady at the front desk gave us a map and circled all the major sites, complete with lines for the quickest walking paths. Then a friendly maid escorted us to our room. Friendliness scores MAJOR points in my book. The room was simple, but comfortable. Be prepared for the smallest showers a human can fit in (all over Italy)! I am a small woman, and I bruised my leg trying to shave. There is no room to move, but at least the Hotel Aberdeen showers are in a stall. We were worried about safety, but were happy to find that the hotel is in a quiet location with securely locked doors to the main building. Even when returning late at night, we felt safe, because there were so many policemen and guards nearby. Our only negative at Hotel Aberdeen was the misfortune of being placed in a room directly next door to the breakfast dining room. We were awoken at 6 am each morning by extremely loud clanking of glasses and dishes. It was so noisy that I had to use earplugs to get back to sleep after 6 am. We were only there for 3 nights, so it was fine, but we would have asked to be moved if it had been there any longer. You may want to request a room away from the kitchen when booking, but I would in no way let this keep me from staying at this lovely hotel. The free breakfast was simple, but good. They had cereal, breads, yogurt, plus juice and coffee. It was enough to get us started on our day of walking everywhere! Another bonus is the free Internet access.

If you agonized over your choice, as I did, look no longer and call this hotel! :) Details: The location is perfect. 10 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain. 15 min. to Pantheon. 15-20 min. to The Spanish Steps. Took a taxi to the Colliseum and Forum, but walked back without difficulty. Lots of taxis near by. 10-15 minute walk from Termini Train Station. Right off Via Nazionale, a popular street. Good shopping near by. Great restaurants within walking distance. 20 min taxi ride to The Vatican. Easy to navigate. We had a large room which was beautifully appointed. It was much, much nicer than any room we've stayed at in other parts of Europe. The private bathroom was large. Furnished with hardwood, marble and tile. The room was kept spotlessly clean. The bed is very comfortable (again, this is superior to other experiences). We did ask for a \"quite\" room. We had no problem with noise (other than being serinaded by our neighbor one night-but I just added that to \"ambience\") I can't say enough nice things about the staff. My e-mail, telephone, and in-person experiences were all superior. They are helpful and knowledgeable. Breakfast is more than adequate: juices, coffee, corn flakes, yogert, croissants, hard rolls, and cheese and ham slices. If you want more (like an American pan cake house or all-you-can-eat buffet) please stay home and quit giving the rest of us American Travelers a bad reputation. Thank you. I priced many hotels and this one is not only reasonable, but I felt you get way more for your money with Hotel Aberdeen than many others I checked.

However, considering they are working with buildings that are hundreds of years old, I'd say they have done a fine job updating it. The breakfast room has a lovely painted ceiling. The breafast had a nice variety of food choices. As in probably all Rome hotels, the only English speaking TV channel was CNN which didn't have good reception. We appreciated the in room safe. Our room was quiet except for the occasional guest who didn't use courtesy while in the hall. The location was great. We took the faster, cheaper train from the airport to the Termini and walked a few blocks to the hotel (they'll give you directions). Most everything is a pleasant walk from the hotel with the bus stops and Metro close as well. Sabrina and a young man were very gracious to help with all our questions. The day we checked out, they stored our luggage 'till later in the afternoon, and offered us the use of a lovely marble bathroom to freshen up in before we finally left. We will stay there again when the opportunity arises.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Myrtle Beach, S.C.", "Title": "\u201cA good value hotel\u201d", "Author": "polly2us", "ReviewID": "UR3278633", "Content": "My daughter and I enjoyed a 4 night stay at the Aberdeen in January. The hotel is very clean, quiet, and excellent value-93euros in Jan. it has free internet service which is a bonus. The staff could not be any better. Any help on restaurants, directions, calling a cab,etc. is done immediately. The only thing that I should have requested was a room on the lst floor as I have a bad knee as there are steps to climb and no elevator. The location is in walking distance of most attractions except the Vatican. Also it is near the train station,but not in a bad neighborhood. I would recommend this hotel very highly.", "Date": "March 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cVery Friendly, Clean and Economical!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3265950", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Aberdeen September 14 through September 20, 2004. After a long journey from San Francisco, the owner was extremely friendly and spoke first in English then in Italian to show us to our room. All of the other staff were very friendly and helped us with any questions we had. They even offered us umbrellas when it was raining. I've been to many hotels and this hotel had probably one of the most friendly staff. The room was very clean and the bathroom had a bidet, towel warmer and looked freshly remodeled. I love taking baths and the tub was great also. The shower also had a removable head. The shower was strong and there was plenty of hot water. The buffet breakfast included cereal, yogurt, meats, croissants, bread, cheese, coffee, milk, OJ, and tea. This would hold us over the day so we only spent money on one meal a day. The hotel is in a great location by the train station so getting around is very easy. There is a great restaurant two blocks away called Il Barocco (45/48 Via Napoli) where we ate most nights and every dish was excellent. Another authentic Italian restaurant about 5 blocks away is Colline Emiliane (22 Via degli Avignonesi) I would highly recommend this hotel for it's price (we paid 125 Euros a night), for it's very friendly staff and because it is very clean.", "Date": "March 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA bit loud\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3256152", "Content": "Good location and reasonable price, however, my room on the 1st floor was very noisy!
