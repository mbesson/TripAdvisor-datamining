I grew up in Hong Kong and lived in Parkview for six years! The facilities are wonderful and the hotel and apartments are beautiful. Parkview is home to locals as well as Expatriates and is very westernized despite some of the reviews I've read. There is a grocery store on site, two outdoor pools, tennis courts and more! Additionally, there are PLENTY of taxis waiting outside the hotel to take you wherever you need to go... You can have them drop you off at the bottom of the hill to catch a bus if you need to save money and /or want the experience of double-decker buses!", "Date": "Jan 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR407867596", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "amandahk99"}, {"Content": "Location, location - this is in a BAD location A long long way out of anywhere - reception are not especially welcoming, felt more like an apartment complex than a hotel - extremely limited facilities - I can't recommend it.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR109726987", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PuffinMarine"}, {"Content": "Smokers Delight - Non Smokers Avoid at All Cost After flying all day we arrived at the Parkview expecting a charming 5 Star serviced apartment.To the contrary we were shown our 2 bedroom apartment which smelt like a tobacco convention had been held in the room the previous 24hrs. When we asked for a non smoking apartment, they said they do not offer non smoking accommodation. We were also advised the air conditioning for each floor is centralised so difficult to totally avoid smoke. Room was also must and very tired.They did suggest we open the window to let fresh air in. Not optimal on the 24th floor in the middle of summer with 3 children sub 5.Bus shelter would have been more accommodating. We never checked in and dusted one months rent. Moving countries is difficult enough.

After a 13 hour flight on which I'm not allowed to take a razor, I expect a nominally 5 star hotel to have this kind of thing ready and waiting - if the Langham can, so should this establishment!The fridge is stocked with soft drinks and water only; there are no nibbles or chocolate of any description, and althought he rooms are large, this is quite clearly set up for people to live in long-term, rather than as a hotel. Overall I found the staff unhelpful and brusque; the decor faded and fairly low-budget; and the overall atmosphere not a patch on the other hotels in Hong Kong. I was very diasppointed and really cannot recommend this establishment when there are so many better alternatives much closer into the centre, at comparable cost and without any of the jobsworth attitude.", "Date": "Oct 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR860323572", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Andrew_Carter"}, {"Content": "Very best choice in quiete beautiful area on the hill If you're tired of noisy and hectic downtown business hotels with 10 or 15% service charge and arrogant service come up to the hill and enjoy ParkView Suites. We spend there only 2 days on Friday to Sunday but reallty enjoyed!! Even standard suite is huge: kitchen with microwave, toaster, stove, fridge, icebox - everything!Livingroom with TV, DVDplayer, CD,VCR, etc., all what you know from 5 star hotels. 2 outdoor pools with waterfalls and area to relax, 1 indoor roman pool, 3 saunas, 2 hot jacuzzis, supermarket and resonable priced restaurants around. Taxi to WanChai takes 10 minutes. Big advantage is the quiete area, the close hiking trails, the more comfortable climate up in the hills (if you hate the fridge A/Cs in conventional hotels here you can even open the windows and let fresh air in your room).I defintely will come back and recommend this place to my colleagues who know HK lively places already (for first timers maybe too far away from the scene). Best choice in any case: single room 1380 HKD incl. breakfast and all taxes!!!
