{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Real Treasure This hotel is a real find in a city of very expensive hotes. The rates are reasonable, the staff friendly and helpful, the rooms a good size for European hotels are clean, the beds excellent and the location fantastic if you don't care about being in the center of Frankfurt. The tram to the center is 1/2 block away from the hotel and takes about 10 minutes. Within 2 blocks is a remarkable supermarket and many little eateries and take out places. Be aware in Germany many things are closed on Sunday. In addition the hotel has a large room off the small lobby with tables, a TV and computer. We spent six nights in the hotel and needless to say were delighted.Because it is a small htoel there is not a conseirge to give you details of when things are open so bring your guidebook. Threre is always someone at the front desk to help. We had room 7 in the back which was very quiet and had great storage space. A special thanks to the staff for making our stay for confortable.", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR662203619", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bethpag"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay! We traveled to Frankfurt for business and pleasure. I attended a conference and my girlfriend took care of the pleasure. We found this hotel to be perfect for our trip. It\u9e93s right on an S-bahn line (stop is literally steps from the door) and you can get almost any place you\u9e93d like to go in Frankfurt easily from this line. It\u9e93s also only a few blocks to the U-bahn, so that made for a quick trip to the Messe (convention center).Our room was very nice, albeit small (but what hotel room in Europe isn\u9e93t?). The bathroom was very nice and the bed was very comfortable.The hotel staff was great, always very friendly and helpful, even when we asked for some quick German lessons.They have a nice living room with a computer and some games, as well as a great espresso machine.The only thing we didn\u9e93t love was the restaraunt attached to the hotel - we found the wait staff was a little snobby. But we only gave them one shot, so maybe it was just an off night.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR312295789", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mglauber"}, {"Content": "Uber Cool       Bookshelf in room, stocked with books about Prague and other German books", "Date": "Jan 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR992568080", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ghanno"}, {"Content": "Style over substance! Beware of inconveniences! Wanted to love this place-- the staff was warm and welcoming, however, they could not overcome the various inconveniences which made our stay intolerable: NO AIR CONDITIONING on floors 3 and above (!?@#$%), supposedly free wireless internet connection in each room did not work, and had to bring laptop down to the main floor parlor in order to use it, AND worst of all, the room was SO LOUD that even with earplugs we could not sleep at night. Of course, since there was no AC, it was necessary to keep the windows wide open, which made the noise level even more intolerable! It was so loud, that we had our TV on the loudest audio setting, and still couldn't hear it. (Our hearing is fine, by the way!) Further, the configuration of the toilet being in a separate non-ventilated room than the shower/sink or bedroom, was not only stifling, but totally inappropriate for a room to be used by more than one person ; pTo make matters worse, when I tried to contact the hotel group designhotels.com, in days after, I received NO REPLY to my repeated e-mails, phone calls, and snail mails. I guess they don't care if they have repeat business. Also, although there is a convenient tram line on the same street as the hotel, this is NOT in a convenient part of town, and requires a good 15-20 min. walk to get to anywhere you want to be...", "Date": "Jun 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR574091106", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Babypix"}, {"Content": "Stylish and well priced Stayed for two nights. Each floor is themed and designed by local German artists. The first room was Green and based on childhood - facing the very busy street unfortunately it stank of cigarette smoke, despite being advertised as non-smoking.No problem, the receptionist was very apologetic and moved me to another room, this time themes dreams. This was a better room being located at the back of the hotel where it was more quiet and I would definitely recommend that given the choice the back is better as the fron has no view to speak of.Near the hotel are various restaurants and cafes so if you don;t fancy eating at the hotel it's not a problem. There is a tram stop outside - No 11 and it takes about 13 minutes to get to Wily Brandtz Plat which is quite central.WIFI is free and the showers are powerful, toiletries are from Aveda.One thing to be aware of is that if you are staying for pleasure, the housekeeping start to make up the rooms from 8:30am. Which is the earliest I have seen.The owner has several bars and restaurants in the city and the hotel is certainly very stylish.For the money,it is hard to fault especially in Frankfurt where \u9227?50 for an average double is the norm.", "Date": "Apr 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR545800524", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AngelosLondon"}, {"Content": "Unglaublich schlechtes Fr\u7709hst\u7709ck und arroganter Restaurantservice   showReview(22177916, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR747979512", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "kaos41"}, {"Content": "sehr witziges Hotel   showReview(20554976, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR887739567", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Klasse Hotel!   showReview(17444259, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR118341784", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "freundlich, sauber, trendy   showReview(15580136, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR525507057", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Chic!   showReview(11658042, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR122197024", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "empfehlenswert   showReview(11432580, 'full');", "Date": "May 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR214092923", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Cool und trotzdem guter service   showReview(11432579, 'full');", "Date": "May 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR381381586", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Sehr angenehmes Businesshotel   showReview(6478565, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR154260991", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "viser"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d629325-r22773444-Goldman_25hours-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "629325", "Price": "$231"}}
