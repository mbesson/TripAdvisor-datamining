We booked the room from Agoda. It was the 3 of that was going to stay at that hotel, so we planned to get some extra bed. In our mind, normally, room at that rate should have extra bed to be fit in. So that day, we came to this hotel late that evening from a several hours flight. When we checked in, we asked for the extra bed, and the answer is : \"We can't give you some extra bed, cos the room is too small.\" and their only solution is for us to upgrade our room to the most expensive room they have + adding some extra bed. It cost us around USD450/night! I asked if we could squeeze one person to the room for some extra cost, the reception simply said, \"no, we can't\". We tried to cancel the room, They said that it will cost us for some cancellation fee. So we keep checking in and hoping that we can use the internet facility in the hotel to find another hotel for my friend to stay, since upgrading the hotel to that rate surely will ruin our budgeting. Then the reception told us, \"Ok..due to security reasons, we would like to remind you that we don't allow 3 people to stay in the room, so if your friend is not going to stay, he should leave at 11 o'clock.\" What kind of notification is that? I know that some people do put some \"extra person\" in their room. But it was so rude to warn your guest like that, when our first intention is to ask for some extra bed. I started to get angry but too tired to debate it. After we checked in, we need to find other hotel for my friend and when I asked for the Wifi Password, the receptionist said, \"I'm sorry, but your room doesn't include internet connection, if you want the internet, it will cost you 10 Dollar per hour or 30 dollar for a day\". We were so frustrated!! It's cost cost and cost. It was not easy to find the last minute hotel in that kind of situation. So finally, we are left with no choice but to upgrade the room and add some extra bed (But the breakfast still only for 2 people). But you know what, that room is not even that big. And when I first smelled their pillow, you know the smell of pillow that had just been used by other people? the smell of their heads? yeah.. that's the smell. We complaint, I just can't imagine how could the hotel don't change the pillow cases for their new guests? The breakfast is not really that satisfying too with their mini croissants, mini cinnamon rolls. But the bacon tasted good. So.. overall.. I'm really disappointed with this hotel. Especially with their flexibility and help. We need staffs that can help us to give solutions.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cPark Regis is a convenient business hotel\u201d", "Author": "shelledquantum", "ReviewID": "UR127984278", "Content": "I liked the lOcation, just 3 min walking distance from Clarke Quay.

To borrow an umbrella, I have to sign a paper which says this umbrella from hotel costs 30 SGD. This is absurd. But the more funny part comes when I return the umbrella, they claimed that they could not return that paper to me because it has be archived while actually they lost that paper. Theoretically, they would like to keep a document to prove that guest borrow some thing from them while dont want to give the same confirmation the guest return it. 3. House keeping person forget daily towels, bath supplies, laundry bag/forms. I have to call the front desk to request those. 4. Broad band internet is not free, which is fine, since I was told by reception desk that the business center could be used, \"free\". It turns out the \"free\" at business center is free 20 mins at Hotel's Mac computer. To get this free 20 mins, I have to sign on a form since this 20 mins is per day(? or per guest).

The room was actually a double, not exactly spacious, but adequate space for myself and my luggage, plenty of cupboard space for clothes and storage of suitcase. Tea/coffee making facilities, complimentary bottles of water replenished daily, fresh towels and bedlinen on request, minibar with the usual selection of beverages and snacks, ironing board/iron.

Chinatown is 5min walk, while Clarke Quay is literally across the road and that leads to Boat Quay via a pleasant walk along the riverfront, and further onto Merlion Park and the stunning Marina Bay Sands and SkyPark - the views from the top are jaw-dropping and not to be missed!! I did not have the breakfast buffet, but did eat at the poolside bar on my last evening at the hotel - therefore I can't really comment on the standard of the restaurants in the hotel. However, what really makes this hotel stand out is the exceptional level of service and attention to detail, which are quite frankly better than many of the 5-star hotels I have stayed in around the world. In particular, Ryan the bellboy was always there to greet me with a smile and even remembered my name. And another outstanding member of the staff was Caroline who manned the business centre - she went to great lengths to assist me in printing my boarding passes and on-line check-in for my flight home. I hope the management are aware of the outstanding assets they have in Ryan and Caroline, who epitomise the concept of customer service and the \"personal touch\"; they really made my stay most memorable. I would not hesitate to recommend the Park Regis to both the tourist and business traveller who are looking for a clean, modern, perfectly located and avant-garde hotel, with outstanding service and the highest levels of professionalism. I look forward to my next visit!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muscat Governorate, Oman", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and welcoming staff\u201d", "Author": "Ros_in_wonderland", "ReviewID": "UR122405628", "Content": "The Park Regis is in a great location steps from the buzz of Clarke Quay and yet peaceful.

The hotel is beautiful and very modern, with a warm helpful staff to add to it. Upon arrival at the hotel, it was pleasant to be greeted by waiting bell staff, and escorted into a beautiful modern lobby. I was quickly checked in, and although my room was not quite ready, I was able to catch up on email and use the gym and pool in the meantime. WIFI in the hotel is only available in the lobby, which was disappointing, and you have to pay for this, but there is wired internet in the guest rooms. Guest rooms are spacious enough for one or two people, and have large views of the pool (other rooms have city views), which is nice. THe rooms have separate areas for walk in shower, and toilet, and the sink/basin area is open to the rest of the room. It is a great set up!! I had a couple drinks in the lobby and breakfast there as well, which was nice. The gym is a good size and overlooks the city and pool area. There is also a nice lounge area by the pool if you have the time to sit around....there is so much to see, do and eat in this great city. Location wise too, it was great. I do a lot of running, and the hotel was a block to Clarke Quay and the picturesque riverside for running and seeing many of the sights. The metro- or MRT as the locals call it, is a block away as well, so getting anywhere is very easy. Cabs are also plentiful and inexpensive. This was my first trip to Singapore, but I will be back, and recommend this hotel, if you want to be by the river, and within easy walking distance to Chinatown. GREAT HOTEL!!!

The first impression was acceptable for a business traveler, not until the time to turn in. I found all the 4 soft pillows had dirty smell as if they had not been changed from the previous guest who checked-out from that room. I requested housekeeping to change them but waited for about 20 minutes. I had to call the second time to repeat my request. Then, housekeeping staff brought 2 hard and 2 soft pillows (instead of all 4 soft pillows) to my room. Yet, two of the pillows still have the dirty smell not from the pillow case but from the pillows within. As it was already late at night, I just made do with the remaining two and requested for another round of change on the next day. That was a major setback that I have ever experienced with a 4-star hotel. The buffet breakfast spread was okay though the food taste was not impressive at all. However, the 25-m swimming pool was great for a weary soul after a strenuous day at work. There was no kid's pool. My advice is to avoid Room No. 301 as it located just next to the lift. You therefore will hear the lift arriving that kept repeating the recorded message: \"Third Floor\" throughout the night. Location wise, it was quite central and the Clarke Quay MRT station was just diagonally opposite the hotel. The entertainment area of pubs, restaurant and night life was just across the street, which was very convenient. However, there was a mosque nearby and one would probably be awakened by the prayer sound at selected hours. A thumb up to the front desk lady as she was very accommodative with my late check-out request at 2p.m. The front desk and restaurant staffs were very courteous and helpful.

Everyone has a making mistakes phase, but, just so you know, they are still in that phase. Staff are generally warm and friendly - compliments to them.

My wife and I for 2 nights and my adult son and my daughter and husband for 1 night - 3 rooms. The hotel is in a great loction. 1 minute from Clarke Quay and walking distance to most other places. I am aware the hotel only opened in December and as such will have some initial problems that I am sure they are addressing. We arrived about 1pm to be told our rooms were not ready which was fine by us as we knew it was a 2pm checkin. We did our checkin procedures at that point and the lovely young lady advised us that we would be receiving a complimentary upgrade but we would have to wait. That was all fine. We all found a little disturbing that each room required a $200 bond, something I have never encountered in all my world travels. Anyway we all agreed to that. We then went over to Clarke Quay whilst we awaited our rooms. We returned about 2.30pm - 3pm to be told that the hotel was running at 100% capacity (good for them) and that our rooms would be some time yet. I complained to the same young lady that it was not right to have to wait another hour or two for a room. She spoke to her supervisor who came and spoke to us. This lady was also lovely and apologised for the delay and offered the 5 of us a complimentary buffet breakfast for the following morning along with a complimentary drink at the bar whilst we waited. We all thought this was a good gesture and well handled by staff. We finally got into our room about 5pm. The rooms were lovely although I am sure none of us received an upgrade as initially advised. They were a standard room, new and very well appointed with very comfortable beds, great plasma and anything else you could wish for. In one of our rooms the builders had forgotten to seal between the shower and bathroom which did causing a very wet floor in the toilet but that was a minor thing. The breakfast although complimentary was a disaster. Apart from the egg station,breads etc. the buffet was mostly cold. Bacon was cold, sausages were cold as well as a number of other offerings. It amazes me that they didn't light the flames under the serveries to keep offerings at least warm. The staff at this hotel are great and very friendly and helpful. It is obvious through this forum that the manager is \"on the ball\" as far as complaints are concerned and is addressing those issues.

Brand new hotel so I expected there would be some hiccups, but I was wrong. Every corner of the hotel was gleaming, our rooms were available ahead of time and even though it was a busy time of year, front desk and concierge staff were super attentive, not rushed, and made it all look easy. Rooms are not huge but that is what is going on with current trendier hotel design... and these were very cool in terms of architectural imagination. Pool area was striking altho the waterfall was pretty noisy and made it difficult to carry on much of a conversation at the pool bar. Would suggest cycling it on and off in intervals. VERY IMPRESSIVE was the resolution of a small complaint I had. There was a slight rate difference between a large travel website I noticed while searching Singapore hotels, and the hotel's guaranteed lowest internet rate. I always prefer to deal directly with the hotel when reserving online so I questioned the difference at check-out... but didn't have time to follow thru since I was on my way to the airport.

In most hotels you will be given the breakfast receipt to sign, here you always had to ask for it. When I checked out, I got the invoice to check and there was a breakfast missing. I told them and regretted shirtly after that I was so honest, because it took them 5min to add another breakfast to my bill.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. This is a 5 star hotel that is brand, spanking new (opened 5 days prior to my arrival) that is in a quiet but convenient location right by the Singapore river, tons and tons of food outlets, restaurants, bars and the Clark Quay MRT (underground train) station. Breakfast: wasn't told if I had buffet breakfast upon check in so assumed I didn't have any as part of the room Service: Very pleasant. Staff went out of their way and were warm and friendly as you would expect. This is sadly lacking in many hotels today in Singapore where its too business like and cold. Cleanliness: Brand new hotel, brand new rooms and very nice and comfy rooms. No dust, airconditioning was cold (which is excellent) and the hotel was quiet which made for excellent sleep as I was down with a bout of flu. Rooms: A little small for the average european traveller but perfect if you are flying solo or down for short trips into Singapore.
