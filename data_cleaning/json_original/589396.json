Also the hotel is located in a very good neighbourhood with walking distance to Starbucks coffee and World Trade Center. This makes it convinient for you to explore the city with close viscinity to restaurants, convinient stores, bakeries and malls. Also the concierge would help you with taxi reservations and even the popular micro-buses and metro buses can be hailed just outside the hotel premises. You also have a choice of the restaurants which hotel has, though I didn't get time to try it but with the hustle bustle around I am sure its worth a try. Also they have a desktop with multiple services provided which helps you spend time just incase you are not in a mood to explore the place. May be just listen to some music.

I was travelling \"European Plan\" so breakfast was incluided. My wife and me were taken by the waiter to a dirty table and the first thing he asked was for the breakfast coupons (that were not delivered at reception at arrival anyway) in a very rude manner. I told him to shut up and arrange the table for my wife and me, before asking me for payment, which he duly did. The lady in charge of reservations was extremely rude to us when we asked her to review ours, as we had kind of difficult scheduled. I had to call my travel agency IN SPAIN to help the reception lady to find ouyr reservations in HER system. I was waken up by a funny lady at midnight just to ask if dinner charges could be charged to my credit card. Next morning at 8:00 a.m, a knock on the door to ask me if I was leaving the hotel that morning. Half an hour afterwards I got a phone call from reception desk, asking the same thing again. To hot things up a little bit, my mother ask, in the executive floor, to heat up his milk for breakfast. The waiter just did not care about her. By the way, breakfast at executive floor was really poor, compared with some other Crowne Plaza Hotels I have stayed in. After all this stuff, we asked for an interview with the Hotel Manager, a very nice man to be honest, who apologized for everything but finally did nothing. He told my wife to indentify the rude waiter of the first day and tell him inmediatly \"I will sack him\", he said, \"but I will not tell him who was the client who complained\" Well, after identifying the waiter, he (the waiter) came back to us apologizing bitterly.... - Parking Parking was not free and expensive, by Mexican standards, but it was a mess to pay the bill every morning, as ATM had an unconsistent behaviour and belly boys did this job whenever the felt it appropiate.

If you decide to stay at this hotel check your room before you accept to stay in it. I was assigned room 1432. It is very small and uncomfortable. To be able to walk accross te room you need to move the chair against a wall. It is impossible to keep the chair in front of the desk and move freely accross the room. In addition, the bathroom is so small that if you keep the door open it blocks access to the toilet. The restaurant has good food, but the service sucks. I had dinner with a group of ten and the waiter got all the orders mixed up. He forgot to place my order at the same time he placed all orders and finally presented a raw fish when everyone in my group was ready to leave. I don'recommend this hotel unless you like small rooms and bad service.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Brunswick Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Decker1", "ReviewID": "UR4727095", "Content": "Just spent 3 days at the Crowne Plaza Hotel de Mexico. This is a brand new hotel right down the street from the World Trade Center. Rooms were clean, spacious and I found all the amenities great, including the wall mounted panel for control of lights, housekeeping call, DND etc. The bed was one of the more comfortable beds I have been in at a hotel. Bathroom was good size with a small jacuzzi tub and stand up shower. As far as the food, I did not do room service, as they have an excellent Italian restaurant on the premises. We had a large party, and all 3 nights we chose to return there for dinner. Great wine, and great food, especially the home made pasta dishes. Yes the service is a little slow, but that is typical. Staff was very friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "March 23, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Crowne Plaza Hotel de Mexico", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d589396-Reviews-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_de_Mexico-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$140 - $208*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Dakota #95</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Col.
