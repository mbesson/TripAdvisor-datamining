The studio had a small kitchen, bathroom, queen sized bed and patio access. The staff was extremely accommodating, as our stove was visibly broken and an appointment was being made to replace it. We didn't realize that the burner itself was the only part that didn't work- the stove was fine, however prior to realizing this, we were given two sets of snorkels free of charge to be used during our stay as well as two nights in a different suite on site so that we could use the kitchen. The air conditioning in our room worked very well which was important to us and we really enjoyed getting up each morning and taking our coffees out to watch the sunrise from the beautiful beach. My husband made a few meals on the charcoal barbecue which was fine as well. With regards to the kitchen, just come a little bit prepared in terms of bringing some items from home if you plan on doing some cooking (we brought salt/pepper, seasonings, vegetable oil, etc). Also, I think it's quite common, but we had several ants, primarily in the bathroom/kitchen areas. One of the hot tubs was not working, but I think there are three hot tubs on site which are available for everyone's use and so we ventured to the tub which overlooks the ocean which was the perfect temperature. As others have mentioned, the parking space can be tight, but this didn't pose a big problem for us. While we thoroughly enjoyed our vacation here, we did a bit more driving than we had anticipated. Prior to reserving a place, we would recommend that you plan ahead in terms of identifying all of the activities that you want to do on the island to ensure that this is the right location for you, as we found ourselves driving on average 1-2 hours each day (we visited Shark's Cove, Electric Beach, Sunset Beach, Turtle Beach, Kailua, Haunauma Bay, Haleiwa, and Dole while we were staying here and then spent the last two nights of our trip in Waikiki).

The Balcony over Hauula was a tad disappointing. The Wi-Fi which was promised might have worked 3 days out of 9. Internet is important as a lot of people do business and important e-mails. The answer was \"the guy was supposed to have come 3 days ago to fix it\" The apartment could be best described as \" under maintained\" The potlights, bathroom fixtures and fans are extremely rusty and gross.The bathroom has no exhaust fan. The drywall had holes poorly patched and painted a different color and two walls were soaking wet with I'm sure a ton of mould in them. My fan in the master was wobbling to the point it could not be used and my air conditioner self destructed with water pouring in the room. The parking is an accident waiting to happen as its extremely tight and dangerous entering the highway. The bulb in the microwave was dead and we advised them and it was never replaced. The ice maker in the fridge did not work. There is no dish washer. The covers for the hot tubs are completely worn out and destroyed, and actually useless at keeping the heat in FYI. Its cheap not to have propane or Nat gas BBQ's and have to ask the guests to go buy charcoal and lighter fluid. A major complaint of mine was the cheap $ 5 Walmart furniture on the \"Balcony\" Its such a beautiful space, why skimp on cheap dirty plastic furniture with no cushions? FYI , in February the wind was absolutely howling night and day making the Lanai almost unusable. Not their fault, but you should know this before.

In response to the comment \"never stay in a place that's not nicer than your house,\" while our place in Boston is certainly appointed better, and has nicer decorations and furniture, I'd be pretty disappointed if a VACATION RENTAL was nicer on the inside than a house I'd spent 10 years outfitting for our private use. (That said, I'd also be disappointed if the more garishly appointed luxury hotels on Waikiki looked better to me than my own home, as well.) And however nice I make my own home, engineering that Pacific ocean 20 feet from the door effect would be pretty tricky. To the complaints about critters getting inside--have these folks ever been to a tropical climate? I lived in Florida, and despite all the necessary and frequent visits from every sort of exterminator under the sun, it was never enough to completely stem the tide of red ants, lizards, and scorpions into our house. We didn't see one invader into our rental, bug or otherwise--a minor miracle in these surroundings. The beach wasn't good enough? Wow. Which one? The one directly behind the house, where my husband and I enjoyed sunrise walks every day? Or the 30 some beaches within a 20 minute car ride either way? From our perspective, the Hale Ko-olau--and the Pukana La, which was our unit--was exactly as advertised. And the never-ending view was even better than we could have expected. We saw Oti a lot, and she was warm, funny, and generous. If we're ever back to Oahu, the only change we'll make it to plan to stay here longer than we did. At 5 days, we didn't get to cover half of what we wanted on the north shore--2 weeks, and we might have been satisfied.

However, it may not be for everyone for several reasons. First of all, we rented the \"Ko'olani Kai\", which is directly on the water. When I say directly, I mean we were looking at the ocean from about 20 ft away from both windows in the master BR, as well as both windows in the livingroom! It was just beautiful in this regard and exactly what i had hoped for. There was little (if anything) else on the north shore for the same price that was right on the water. The unit was plenty spacious for my husband and me, traveling with my (adult) son. This 2 BR unit had 1 bathroom, so consider whether this is a comfortable arrangement for your party...it was fine for us. It is, however, a little basic...maybe \"rustic\" in some ways. If you normally stay at the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton, you are unlikely to be happy here. The linens and pillows were not what I would consider hotel quality. There was no bath soap or shampoo provided, and many of the windows were not in working condition. Too bad, because we would not have needed the A/C, if we had been able to open the place up and get some of that beautiful ocean breeze! The kitchen was up-to-date, with decent appliances...we did a fair amount of cooking in as there are few restaurants close by. The kitchen is a little \"funny\" though...some of the cabinets are blocked by the new fridge, which is apparently bigger than the original! And, yes, we did see (just one) cockroach, but I killed him! And yes, there were tiny ants that were attracted to the counters if food was left out...easy enough--we simply did not leave anything on the counters. So, overall, we were quite happy here, despite a little tackiness, and these few issues above. Would I recommend it to people? Well, it depends on who you are and what your priorities are.

From our welcome orientation to our final \"Aloha\" we felt like we were treated with respect and courtesy. Make no mistake, this is not a posh, fancy hotel. Instead the accommodations are more like home. And that is exactly what we wanted. In fact we succeeded in not venturing into Honolulu or Waikiki other than to catch our plane. Our king-sized bed was very comfortable and we slept like babies. The AC worked well when we needed it. The kitchen was adequately appointed and we were able to prepare most of our meals there. The bathroom was small, but nicely decorated. The cable TV had good reception. The hot tubs were spotless. The grounds were meticulously maintained. The beach was somewhat rocky, but there was a sandy area just a short walk away. The rocks in the ocean meant that the snorkeling was pretty good with lots of fish and coral. Don't bother going to Hanauma Bay. We enjoyed the kayak that is available for guest usage. The laundry facilities there meant we could pack light. There is a grocery store within walking distance that had a good selection of local foods. Parking is a bit of an issue, so our advice is to rent as small of a car as you can. Though we took a technology vacation, there is WIFI. We were able to use the office computer to print out our boarding passes before we left from the airport. Some of the activities that we enjoyed in this area were: snorkeling, the Polynesian Cultural Center, quaint local restaurants (our favorites were Papa Ole's and Tom's Bakery), Sharks Cove, Waimea Falls, hiking, horseback riding (Gunstock Ranch), watching surfers on the North Shore, and just driving up and down the coast.

Zack Oda (Cousin #2) promptly answered every question we had about the place before we came and was very friendly and quick to respond to the very few issues we had while we stayed there. Pros: --Check-in: When we arrived, the on-site staff was there to meet us and our check-in took only a few minutes. She showed us where everything was, gave us paddles for the kayaks, and provided us with some tips on where to eat. --Location: Hale Ko'olau was only about a 30 minute drive from Honolulu Airport and a gorgeous drive at that. It was central to everything we wanted to do on the North Shore. 30 min drive to Waimea Bay, Waimea Valley, and Hale'iwa and maybe 45 minutes south to Kailua Beach (the BEST beach on Oahu!) Plus, our unit was RIGHT ON THE BEACH. I absolutely loved waking up and sitting in our living room to watch the sun rise. Stunning view from every window. The shoreline in front is a bit rocky, but it was fun to walk the beach (there's a good swimming beach just down the shore a bit) and our kids ended up playing in the surf in front of the unit too. --Great service: The coffee machine in our unit didn't work but we let Zack know and it was replaced the same day with a functioning one. --Size: Hale Makua was actually a little TOO big for our family of 4, which was a nice surprise. If we go back, we may pick one of the smaller units. We were really only there at night and found we didn't even need the full kitchen so much. It was very open and airy in the living/dining room/kitchen area. --Rooms: Our unit had two bedrooms - one with a queen and one with a king bed. Both beds were comfy and the rooms were well-maintained. Our two bathrooms were also clean and the showers were nice. --Washer/Dryer: There was a washing machine and dryer in the unit, which was convenient. The cost for each load was only $4 ($2 to wash, $2 to dry) which was actually pretty cheap compared to the local laundromat. --Free Wi-fi: Helpful for us. We used the internet to research and decide what we're going to do in the area the next day. (Con: The signal strength for the wifi was bad, and even when you could connect, access to the internet was spotty at best, but we didn't mind -- we weren't there to use the internet and were rarely in the unit!) --Extras: The hot tub located between our house and the other unit was clean and had a view of the ocean. Lots of gear for you to use while you're staying there, including boogie boards, sea kayaks, and snorkel gear. Cons: --Kitchen: We opened the dishwasher to run our dishes, only to find that there was egg in standing water in the bottom of the dishwasher. We ran the dishwasher with soap but without any dishes in it and that seemed to take care of it. Some of the dishes and pans were put away dirty. --Condition of Unit/Appliances: The unit itself wasn't exactly as pictured on the website. I think the photos may be a few years old. Time, wind, rain, sun, and salt water have taken their toll on the outside of the house and much of the inside too. The couches were comfy, but had a sticky feel to them, likely due to the salt air from the windows being constantly open. Many of the windows in the Hale Makua unit did not close, which was a bit awkward when we had two days of stormy weather. A palm tree branch kept pounding into one our windows during the entire stay (it was very windy!) and woke us up a few times. We let Zack know about it, but it wasn't taken care of before we left. The TV worked, but the volume control on the set was broken (you could only turn it up, not down) and Zack wasn't able to find the remote for us. Many of the dishes/pans were put away kind of dirty, but we were able to wash them ok before using. --No AC: Not a huge deal. The fans seem to keep air circulating just fine. --Phone: Didn't work in our unit, but wasn't a huge deal for us since our cell phones had strong reception. We neglected to tell Zack about this while we were there. (Sorry, Zack!) Some of the other reviews were a bit harsh on Hale Ko'olau and I suspect those people are used to very upscale, swanky hotels. Let's be clear: Hale Ko'olau is not a four star luxury resort. It is exactly as they pitch it: a nice, clean, affordable place right on the beach!

It's a great place to see Oahu because it's sort of in between North Shore attractions and Waikiki. If you're looking for a hotel where you get pampered and you just relax on the beach and don't leave your hotel, Hale Koolau is probably not for you. Hale Koolau is simple and private. My fiance and I wanted to see a lot of Oahu and this was the perfect place to stay! We had a lanai right outside of our studio where we ate most of our meals! Also, there was a hot tub right in front of our studio that we used ALOT, esp after a long day (you can see the ocean from the hot tub and the lanai). They kept the hot tub reallyl clean. The hot tub is a shared one but there was rarely anyone else in it. The only thing between our studio and the ocean was another rental house. There were people staying in the house, but we didn't see them often. We also rarely saw other people on the beach, which was nice. The grounds were nicely landscaped with tropical plants everywhere. The people who work there are very friendly. The first day we were there, we got boogie boards and snorkel gear from the office that we used for our entire stay. On the negative side: there was a rooster that would crow every morning around 5 AM. But after 2 days, I didn't even hear it anymore. Also, the beach in front of the house is not good for swimming because of rocks. But, its just a short drive or walk to other sandy beaches. Some of the things my fiance and I did while we were there was: visiting a bunch of beaches (Waimea Bay, Sunset Beach, Turtle Beach, Malaekahana Beach, Laie Beach, Waimanalo.. ), hiked to Maunawili Falls, snorkeled at Hanauma Bay, Luau at Hale Koa Hotel in Waikiki, hiked Diamond Head, visited Pearl Harbor, surfing lessons at Malaekahana Beach with Sunset Suzy, Hawaii Shark encounter, Horseback Riding Tour at Kualoa Ranch, visited Laie Point.. ect. I recommend doing all of those things. We also waded to Chinaman's Hat, which is an island off the beach right across from Kualoa Ranch. We climbed to the top of the island, too. Waimea Bay was our favorite beach and you have to jump off the rock into the ocean! Plus, we saw ALOT of sea turtles there. Make sure you go to the shrimp trucks on the North Shore. We went to Fumi's 3 times and we loved the spicy garlic shrimp! We bought groceries at this market that was about a mile up the road, so we made most of our food. The studio had all we needed to cook. Try not to leave valuables on the beach.. we had our bag stolen while we were swimming to Chinaman's Hat, but all we had in it was towels and shirts.. a local person found our bag in the bathroom.. so it worked out okay, just be careful. We did the Shark encounter our last morning and the boat broke down, which caused us to be two hours late checking out of Hale Koolau.

Service: Zack was professional, organized, friendly and prompt from my original booking on through the follow-up after we returned home. It is a self-service rental, but they were quick with supplying snorkle gear, kayak paddles and sand toys for my daughter. The grounds are well maintained--the trimmed lawn, plentiful foliage, and comfortable hot-tub. We didn't mind paying for laundry, I guess because we knew that was part of the deal. Ammenities: Our group was mixed on the lack of AC. My mother-in-law (coming from the Texas heat) loved the fresh air and sound of the ocean with the windows and patio open (which we had to watch like hawks as we have a curious two year old). I (coming from chilly San Francisco) wished I could have escaped the humidity just for a bit. Mostly the lack of AC creates a problem for the owner's--wear and tear on the building exterior due to sea salt, new ceiling fans already inoperable, etc. The kitchen was nicely updated with plently of utensils, some nice peices of furniture. The couches were dated, worn and covered with slip covers that loved to collect sand. Not really a problem for us, but not exactly luxurious if that is what you are looking for. The top floor was empty while we were there, so that wasn't really a problem. Parking was no problem either. You do have to be careful backing out, but it wasn't that big of a deal. The biggest problem for my husband was the WiFi never worked (I actually liked being disconnected from the rest of the world!) Location: Excellent! A nice big lanai, lawn with picnic table and chairs, retaining wall and a short drop to the beach! No, it is not a wading beach, but that didn't really bother us since our children are still a bit young--we loved just playing in the sand. My husband and I did snorkle right off the back--it can be done! The visibility was not great, but we did see sea turtles which was neat. My father in law took the kayak out and enjoyed that. Near-by: We loved hiking the Hauula Loop, there is a grocery store just up the street. We never went, but the Polynesian Cultural center is just five minutes. We enjoyed some nice dinners out at Turtle Bay Resort, Waimea Joe's at Haiku Gardens and The Crouching Lion Inn--all not that far of a drive away. We found a playground about 15 minutes south with a great snowcone/breakfast/lunch place across the street. We enjoyed day trips to the Northshore where there is a great spot to watch the sea turtle bask in the sun, a beautiful protected reef for snorkling and a shopping/dining district. We also enjoyed Kualoa Park and hiking up to Diamond Head. We never went into Waikiki or Honolulu. Oahu is a small island and it is possible to do quite a lot in a week (or not a lot if that is what you prefer). We were perfectly happy to be in the small village of Hauula--it was just what we wanted. Value: We feel this is a great value.

They returned my phone calls quickly, made changes to our reservations without charging a fee, and were very polite and courteous. AFTER arriving (which was Labor Day) and trying to check in, I had difficulty making contact with them. I called the person who was supposed to meet us at the units to let us in, and she was at the beach and didn't want to leave. She told us to go find a restaurant, do some shopping, and take our time. Even after doing these things (and being more than ready to check in so we could go visit a beach), she said she was just having too good a time at the beach and gave us a pass code to get the keys out of the boxes and let ourselves in. I never did see her, although my niece was there when she finally showed up and brought some snorkeling equipment and boogie boards. We were left to find out where outside trash cans & laundry facilities were located. Kai Lani: The hide-a-bed was broken, so don't county on sleeping 8 people there. I brought a couple of air mattresses and barely could accommodate the 7 of us who stayed in Kai Lani. As there are no thresholds under the doors, we were frequently visited by lizards during the night and had a few show up in the day time, which was very exciting for the 3 year old and teenagers in our group, and a bit alarming for the parents of the 4 month old babies. The safe was also broken and the management did not have a key to open in. The icemaker in the freezer was broken, as well, and we had difficulty getting the dishwasher to work, but once we figured out the trick to it, it wasn't a problem. The other place (Kauaii Kai??), rented by my nephew and his family was nicer. They didn't report any problems with the facilities. The \"beach\" behind the units was fun, but rocky. We had a great time watching the crabs in the morning, as well taking in the sunrises. The ocean was fairly shallow with a rocky floor, but was good for swimming. We were there when the jelly fish were on the beach, but didn't find them to be a problem. They weren't as numerous as we were expecting. As an FYI - temperatures averaged around 80 while we were there, and one morning we awoke to 82 degrees with 86% humidity! Even the trade winds didn't keep us cool. Overall, I thought the accommodations served us pretty well considering budget restraints. However, we will likely choose a different location if we ever visit Hawaii again.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "FLorida", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "FloridaPaul", "ReviewID": "UR31437826", "Content": "We were very pleased with our accomodations.

Once we found it, getting our car into the very tight parking area was a serious challenge. We were given very handy directions well in advance, but the access code was wrong. After getting the correct access code we entered a fairly 'tired' duplex with sticky counter tops, thick dust on the ceiling fan, no linen for the sofa beds, an old blood stain on one of the sofa bed's mattress (which was NOT comfortable at all), and missing mirrors on the bathroom cabinet. The hot tub that was right outside our suite was out of order, it was not a very new sign indicating that, and we saw no service person come to do anything with it at all. The caretaker suggested we use another hot tub two duplexes down, which we did but felt like we were intruding on other people's space. I sent an email to the owner 2 weeks after the trip and I received no reply at all. The fact that this place was right on the water was absolutely spectacular. The rest was downright skid row. The caretaker said we got that place for much less than what it normally goes for...I find it shocking that people will pay that kind of money for such lack of quality.

We stayed in the kauai kai studio which is in the back of the property on the 2nd floor. Not much of a view from there but it is only 100 feet from the beach as you walk around the side of the condo in front of you. The studio was clean and much larger than a Residence Inn kitchen suite. It sits next to the main highway and you can hear some traffic at night but was not a major problem. We enjoyed the privacy and the hot tubs that are outside for any guests to use. They had boogie boards, snorkel gear and kayaks that you could use. Washer and Dryer was nice addition. The caretakers - Elma especially - were helpful and friendly. The beach that it sits on is not one that you will spend much time on. It is rocky. We did take the kayaks out there and were in the midst of 4 or 5 turtles that kept coming up for air. There are plenty of nice beaches in the area - one of our preferred was about 5 minutes north in Laie - Hukilau beach. It is 5 minutes away from the Polynesian Cultural Center (which was a lot of fun) and 15 minutes from turtle bay. Minimal tourists on local beaches until you get up to the North shore beaches - Sunset, Wameia, etc. The area where this is located is a bit run down, but I always felt safe. Dining is essentially non-existent - but there is a foodland in Laie and a market in Hauula as well. We did drive up to Turtle Bay and ate at Ola's which was excellent and expensive but quite romantic as you are sitting on the beach. Turtle Bay Hotel was nice, we checked out their rooms and facilities and were quite impressed - food would be costly though with 3 on site restaurants vs having your own kithchen at Hale Koolau. Overall, the Kauia kai was nice and we would stay there again.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hale Ko'olau!\u201d", "Author": "JohnTes", "ReviewID": "UR21793274", "Content": "I decided to visit Hale Ko'olau for a weekend getaway from the hustle-and-bustle of the city.
