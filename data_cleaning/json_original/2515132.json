I know it was their first hotel, but you'd think they have the money for some basic upgrades by now. Tons of cons: The room was pretty minimalist, and we were surprised by the lack of basic amenities- no dresser, no closet, and only 2 hangers provided to hang your stuff on a pipe projecting from the wall. It felt very spartan, and we kept tapping on the panel walls, in hopes of finding a secret door or cabinet. The only mirror is a strip that runs across the wall, around 5 feet high. So we had to stand on the bed in an attempt to see how we looked before we went to a birthday party. The bathoom had no surfaces to unpack anything. The door to the bathroom hangs from the ceiling, so there is no auditory privacy. The sky light is nice in the day time, but it made it impossible for us to sleep in. Pros: The bathroom had nice shampoo/conditioner. The bed was comfortable. The view from our window was nice. Location is great, and though we had to street park, it was very easy to negotiate. Breakfast is fine- lots of self serve options. There is half & half for the coffee, which was Stumptown. The hair dryer I obtained from the front desk worked well.

The location was good to, about halfway between Pike Place and the Space Needle. We were initially unsure about sharing a bathroom with the other guests, but it was fine. I figured that people pay hundreds of pounds to stay at spa hotels and wander round in their robes, and this was no different! The bathrooms were all spotlessly clean, and there was always one free. The staff on reception were always friendly and helpful, making fab recommendations for eating/drinking. We would never have found Bathtub Gin without them! But I have to turn to the downsides. Our first night there was a Saturday, and it was pretty noisy from the bar downstairs until about 0230. We were also in the middle of a random heatwave, and with no air con in the room, just a desk fan, it was HOT! I am keen on a cold room, so others may not have had as much of an issue as me. It's true there was no wardrobe, but we were living out of out cases anyway, so we weren't worried about that. I guess the othernthing would be the size of the room, about the size of a double (not the master) bedroom in a modern house in the UK. We thought it was OK, but probably smaller than most would expect, especially in the US.

This didn't bother us much, but it may bother others as there is no A/C so you pretty well have to leave the windows open on a warm day. They do have a small fan to help with that as well. Rooms and (shared) bathrooms were very clean. As far as the location goes, it was very central. About a 6 min walk to the Space needle, and about 10 min walk to Pike Marketplace. Also, a lot of great restaurants and shops in the area too. The breakfast Ace provides was awesome! You can make your own waffles, or if you prefer, there is yogurt and granola, milk and OJ, and coffee.

The rooms were clean, minimalist, with a bed, sink, Ipod/music player and flat screen TV. There was no air conditioning, but the windows opened, so the room cooled down pretty well. Our room was on the street side. If you do not like street noise, ask for a room in a different part of the hotel. The rooms did not have a toilet or bathing facilities. There were five bathrooms, four with shower facilities down the hallway (for about a total of 30 rooms). They seemed to be cleaned pretty well, although I am sure not perfectly. Although the hotel seemed pretty full, we never had an issue finding one of the bathrooms or showers to use. Not ideal for many people and if we were staying for more than a couple of nights, this would have been an issue.

Second, upon seeing the website and learning that you shared a bathroom with the other guests if you have a standard room, I was in (because hey, I wanted a different hotel experience). Once my boyfriend and I arrived in the city (around 10 AM), we simply parked by the Ace and asked them where their paid parking was. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and told us we could check in early and take advantage of the parking lot right then (which was a huge relief since I hate dealing with parking). With the room, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which irritated my boyfriend a bit. I thought the room was cute and since we were simply there to sleep, I had no problem with it. The bed was comfy and I found the bathrooms to be incredibly clean. As for the breakfast, I loved that it went until noon (because that meant my boyfriend and I could eat a little something upon checking in). I have to give another shout out to the receptionists because they were extremely helpful with directions. The one thing that got a bit on my nerves was the noise, which kept me up that night.

We were happy with the first impressions. Our room was decent sized and bright on a corner with two windows (it\u2019s one pictured on their website) and with a Shepard Fairey wall. We asked the desk clerk about parking, since it does state on the website there is off street parking available. He wouldn't tell us anything more than \u201cif you got street parking stay there until 8am when they start charging.\u201d We couldn't get any lot info from him, so we drug our luggage to the room. Once we headed to bed things got worse. The bed size is not listed on the website and I assumed it would be queen. The beds are full sized which made sleeping comfortably a little difficult, but there wasn't much sleep happening in that room. The room was above a bar, with a loading/delivery zone on one corner and a bus stop on the other. The noise was staggering and continued all through the night and into the morning when we had to wake early to go feed the meter. Also the glowing light from the hall showing through the window above the door was annoying and I never saw it turned off. The next day we requested to move (and in fairness the rest of the staff we dealt with were very nice and accommodating) but we were unable to move until the following night because the hotel was full. On a plus side, the shared bathrooms were never an issue finding one free, and the breakfast did include coffee, tea, fresh waffles, toast, granola, juice, yogurt and apples. There are also piles of good magazines available for guests, and robes in the rooms to use. The second night I slept slightly better because I used earplugs (which I do not find an acceptable solution) and we did again have to wake early to deal with the car. The third night we were moved to a smaller interior room which was considerably quieter (we downed out the music we could still hear with the fan) and it was across the hall from the bathrooms.

The people at the front desk were great...Ed actually told us the best ferry to ride and where to go(we went to Bainbridge Island on his recomendation and it was beautiful!) The bathrooms were clean..and having to leave the room to shower was not a problem, they offered shampoo,conditioner, and bodywash in the shower. Breakfast was great. Coffee was strong. You could generally never tell that anyone else was staying at the hotel unless you saw them in the hallway. The employees leave the hotel at midnight and your room key works as the front door key...not a problem what so ever. The mirror in our room had the phrase \"you are beautiful\" etched into it. The area was FANTASTIC! 2nd ave is a blast as far as the bar scene goes! I 100% loved the Ace and would most def go back.

The staff is friendly, and informational- they arranged to have a Lincoln Towncar take me to the airport, and it cost the same as a dingy cab would have- didn't have a laptop with me, but I needed directions to a few places and they printed them out for me.

Location is awesome; very close to Pike Place Market/Needle/several shops/bars/resturants/etc. If you're not a smoker (I am) and can handle walking about 8-10 blocks and not feel like youre going to die afterwards, the retail district is within walking distance- or if you are not thrilled to walk, you can easily hop on a bus, or take a cab. There is a convenience store right across the street. Doors are locked after midnight; it can be somewhat noisy at night, if your window is open- but you're downtown, so what do you expect??! All of the rooms that I stayed in were clean; having a sink in the room is a plus (don't have to walk in the hallway to the shared bathroom looking haggard, in your PJs just to brush your teeth). Shared bathrooms are actually a good thing if you're staying with someone- you don't have to fight for the shower, you can both get ready at the same time! I've stayed in two other hotels in Seattle - Hotel Max, and the Moore Hotel- and while I loved the other two, the Ace will always be my favorite!!! The rooms are cheap- but they aren't cheap as in- Bates Motel- you're going to be mugged while you're sleeping, or 'filthy' cheap- the Ace just doesn't have all of the amenities that some people demand while traveling. It's an ideal hotel for singles/young-ish/business people who aren't planning on staying couped up in their room while calling room service all day.

My husband and I were among the oldest guests of the hotel, by several years, but we never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome. Justin was so helpful when I called BEFORE our stay, recommending Dollar rental cars as they not only give discounts to Ace guests but also waive the fee for returning the car to the airport instead of the pickup site. (Both John and Jessica at Dollar were extremely nice too!).This arrangement allowed us to travel down to family in Gig Harbor and then use the car to return to the airport the next day. Justin also informed us that we would most likely have to change rooms on the last night of our 3 night stay, due to a snafu with our hotel.com reservation. Once at the Ace, we were warmly welcomed by Jibriil who showed us our room on the lower level. I was a bit surprised as Hotels.com had \"guaranteed\" a king size bed and we had a double. I asked Jabriil about the mixup (never having booked through hotels.com before) and he explained that there must have been an overlap in the booking. The room and bed were comfortable and a decent size with a large clean bathroom. I'm not that high maintenance, but do like to read at night, but there was no reading lamp in the room, just overhead recessed lighting. Jabriil came to my rescue with a small reading lamp and extra pillows. All were clean-pillows obviously sprayed with lysol between uses-but no biggie. The only thing missing in that room was a place to hang clothes and a couple more hangers. On the last night we did indeed have to move to a smaller room. Same size bed, smaller bathroom-a bit noisier as it was next to the stairwell. Still, we were quite comfortable and slept well. So the plusses: Justin and Jibriil-definitely they are the nicest guys, unpretentious , friendly, helpful. The location in Belltown is in the heart of all the under 30 hipness, but we over 30's , un-inked, non-smokers did not feel too out of place!

We checked the bathroom and it also had black mold growing in the 1x1\" tiles. I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman if there was some way to check on a refund due to health concerns regarding my asthma and my inability to stay in the room. He said I had to check with Hotels.com since I prepaid and booked through them. Fair enough. He was helpful in saying that he would make a note in his computer system for verification of reasons we couldnt stay, not sure if this actually occured but we will see. Staff seemed pleasant but not very proactive in resolving problems.

Here is why you should choose the Ace (according to us): Location. The Ace is in Belltown, we walked everywhere we went, and we found that belltown was the perfect spot. The best resturants, and close to the free bus zone if you can't stand the walk. We even took the bus back to the airport (it only cost $4.00!) *try the Macrina Bakery, and Marco's Supperclub which is located across the street from the Ace! Price: for what we paid $85.00, we didn't expect much of anything. But, we received first class treatment for almost nothing! Our room was one of the cheapest rooms they offer (shared bathroom, no view) and we liked that. It was very cozy, and the shared bathrooms were always clean! Believe me, I was scared of the idea of shared bathrooms, but at the Ace, I prefer it. The showers are huge, and they pump in soft music. Our room was clean, and the hotel itself was beautiful. Modern, and crisp. The breakfast in the morning was great too! Fresh juice, milk, toast, fruit; we were always happy to eat down in the cute kitchen area. Staff: I can honestly tell you that the staff at the Ace hotel is and was the best we had ever met. They always were willing to look things up for us online, give info, loan dvds, and a dvd player to the guests, give out free magazines---just all around helpfull. The Hotel vs. Other Hotels: After our trip in Seattle we headed to two other cities...we booked the most expensive hotels, and yet we were still pining for the Ace!

So anyone that's very religious might not find this too humorous, while others will think it's hilarious (as did I). Even the art on the walls weren't your typical boring hotel feel. I actually took pictures of this room because I loved it so much. Plus, the most fantastic part about my stay here (besides the great shampoo/conditioner and how the bathroom was designed in general) was the free breakfast! It wasn't your standard old banana with some concentrated OJ. It was make your own parfait, with fresh OJ and even Soy Milk. This is definitely for a certain type of crowd. And people that want something more luxurious shouldn't stay here. People that appreciate a cleaner more modern style should. Plus, it's located in Belltown, which is in walkable distance to Pike Place Market (where they throw the fish) and the Space Needle.

More like a 7 of clubs.\u201d", "Author": "nycwestvillage", "ReviewID": "UR5350973", "Content": "Currently staying at the Ace Hotel on business, since other hotels downtown are booked. The hotel is decent, but more like a 2 star based on my experiences. Overall my experience has been just ok. The room is a \"deluxe\" room according to the hotel, which isn't very deluxe-it just means I get to avoid sharing a bathroom. So here's my summary: Pros: Location-Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Convinience store across the street. And an easy walk to downtown about 10 minutes. For those who don't want to walk, there's a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent service. If you walk a block or two further closer to downtown, you'll be within the \"free ride\" zone to save yourself a 1.25/1.50 at rush hour. Wireless Intenet included The hotel is clean. Small continental breakfast included featuring toast, granola cereal and juice included in price. Cons: No elevator at the entry, so you have to climb a decent flight of stairs to the reception area. Not a big deal for the young, but could be a hassle if you've got heavy luggage. Receptionists seem friendly enough, but you can tell this is part-time work for them, and they don't seem to be all that interested in the comings and goings of people. I've walked past them numerous times at all hours of the night without so much as a look up to see who is coming into the hotel, or to give a simple greeting. Rooms are small, just enough for a bed, and a tiny desk and chair. And I'm in the \"deluxe.\" Decor is trying to be boutique-y, but to me it just looks like a sanatorium. Walls in the hallways and rooms are all white. There is no closet or drawers to speak of, so your luggage and clothes are on the floor in an already small room. You do have metal hangars hanging from a coat hanger on the wall which you can hear clanking at night and in the morning from the adjacent room. Bathroom is ok size, but looks cheap, with only a stand-up shower and toilet with open u-faced seating like in an airport or store, which isn't a big deal except that the towel holder is placed right above it, and to get a folded, stacked, and jammed in there towel out, it's easy to pull out the rest of them which fall into the toilet--not real smart thinking Ace. Naked lightbulb serves as the lighting for the room, which adds to the hostel/sanitorium/potential flophouse hotel effect. And the clincher is tv on a wall arm extending from the ceiling. There's nothing like a tv attached to the wall/ceiling to give you that \"motel\" feeling. Also, you have to leave a \"service room\" tag on your door when you leave, or they will not do housekeeping. They try and sell it as \"leaving you alone,\" but I think it's more about saving money. Summation: For location, and due to the few options available in this price range, this hotel is a decent option. But to call it a \"boutique\" hotel experience and charge a discounted corporate rate of 160 a night for a plain room that measures 15X15 in Seattle?

Don't be \"put off\" by the shared bathroom situation though. The bathrooms are not dorm-like bathrooms where you are showering with strangers. Each shower and toilet is designed for individual use. They were super clean and offered all amenities (shampoo, conditioner, towels, hair dryer, etc...). It got a bit loud at night because of the club right downstairs but... I woke up once and went right back to sleep. The front desk staff is extremely helpful. They are all young locals so they can offer suggestions for any type of tourist activity.

I'll also admit the hype surrounding the Ace Hotel made me curious. I found both positive and negative hype across the internet, and booked the Ace with an open mind. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms and staff and overall value. If you've stayed at pensions in Europe and liked them, you'll be at home at the Ace. When I arrived I asked to upgrade from my single to a room with a washroom attached, imagining the worst about the Ace's communal washrooms. I needn't have worried. The ratio between rooms and washrooms is small. The washrooms are clean with a focus on white-tiled functionality. The room itself was small but I didn't feel I needed more. In relatively tiny area the Ace manages to fit in a comfortable bed, retro TV, desk and a stainless steel sink, all in an undeniably cool style. More than enough without feeling cramped. The staff was polite and interested, and offered well considered suggestions for food and entertainment. With perks like free Wi-Fi (a bit slow), free breakfast and parking, the Ace is a deal. That being said, if you are at all finicky about the hotels you stay at, the Ace may not be for you. Upon first entering the Ace you are overwhelmed by stairs reaching out of sight; note there is no elevator for your heavy luggage. The Ace sits above the Cyclops bar, a hangout for Gen Y hipsters. The music, chatter and cigarette smoke will filter up to your room. But that's all part of the vibrant area of Belltown that the Ace is in.
