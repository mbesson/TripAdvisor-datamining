We found this place after wandering around looking for new accommodations for the remainder of our stay in Barcelona. It's across the street from the Chocolate Museum! Stephan and his staff were attentive and welcoming from the moment we walked through the door. Our room was bright, airy and clean with high ceilings and a lovely little balcony with french doors. The bed was comfy and there were no exterior street noises to be concerned with. The common area was great. It had two oversized sofas and a little nook with tables and chairs. There was complimentary, coffee/espresso, tea and bottled water. There was a also a computer for guest use. The only cons we experienced were (1) noise from the hallways bled into the rooms a little more than we have experienced at other establishments and had a bit of an echo effect given the acoustics of the building but a good pair of earplugs solved that problem. (2) there is no printer attached to the computer in the common room. If you wanted to print something out you had to send it to the front desk via email or download it to a flash drive and take it to the front desk. The staff were very happy to accommodate so it really wasn't that big of a deal. With that said these were minor things that did not reflect negatively on our stay. We would definitely recommend this hotel as well as stay here again ourselves.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Value": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDissapointing\u201d", "Author": "Mimm11", "ReviewID": "UR127988270", "Content": "Booked the XL room for a special occasion for myself and my boyfriend and we were both very excited about staying in the hotel. The website leads you to believe that this is the largest room available and we thought it would be very spacious and the nicest room they had. However, the room was not very big and the quality of everything in the room was poor. It was supposed to have a private balcony, but it had a very small balcony with little stools, not chairs to sit on and it was shared with three other rooms. We noticed that there were some bigger rooms with private balcony's and asked the staff about this, but were told these were XXL rooms and we were not offered these as the booking was made through booking.com and they are only available direct from their website. However, I have since checked the hotels own website and there is no XXL room on there either!!!???? The blind did not work properly on the window \u2013 the fabric was torn and the electric mechanism to wind it up and down had broken, so it kept catching in the doors every time you opened and closed them which was annoying. We complained about this, but it wasn\u2019t fixed properly. The LED lights are actually pretty cheap looking and pointless. Our toilet didn't flush properly. The shower leaks water all over the floor. No bathrobes as advertised. We are not fussy travelers at all, as we have backpacked all over the world and stayed in hostels and hotels of all types, and although this hotel was nice, in a lovely building with comfy beds and a great location - I believe if you are charging that amount of money for a room, you need to be able to back it up with quality and fixtures that work and unfortunately this hotel did not (more shabby & basic, than chic & basic). Overall pretty disappointing for the high cost (171 euros per night).

Location - The hotel was easy to get to from the train station near Las Ramblas - we walked there on a few occasions and this made it very easy. Mind you it is a bit of a walk but we honestly didnt mind and along the way we oftens tumbled across other areas we might not have seen otherwise. The hotel is also close to the beach (walking distance) so some days we walked down there. Ask at the hotel about renting a bike - so easy to bike ride around this area and very fun when you ride down to the beach! Hotel - Loved it! First impression was fantastic, beautiful huge wooden door that you walk through, very interesting lights over every door, gorgeous self serve area - I really wanted to stay somewhere a little different and this definitely delivered on comfort and design. The room was also gorgeous with lights in front of the bed and even a light 'curtain' sectioning off the shower! If you are shy there is also a proper curtain to pull over the shower. I would say though that if you book a twin room and you are not a couple you might not like the bathroom arrangements - its quite open (not a separate room), so just keep that in mind. Service - The service was fantastic. We originally only booked 4 nights but then realised that we arrived a day early and booked a 5th night. However when we had to book the extra ight they only had a smaller room available so we had to book that. However when we arrived the hotel staff were so lovely and said they had upgraded us for the night so that we would not have to change rooms during our stay. They were always very happy to help and knew the area very well.

The amenities like free coffee, tea, water, cookies, internet access, and gym were great. The room was very neat with the multi-coloured lighting, the strings hanging over the door and the middle-of-the-room shower. It was a good size and had a rack for hanging clothes and drawers. We had a simple breakfast one day at the hotel restaurant, Kharma, and the croissant was very undercooked. The food at dinner was better though. The hotel is in a great location, situated closely to enough restaurants so there is plenty of choice. It is a short walk from the Jaume I subway, La Rambla(don't eat there), close to monuments, and a 15-minute walk from the beaches of Barcelona. Our only complaint was the lack of ventilation in the room. After taking showers in the morning and leaving for the day, the room would be very musky when we returned and we would have to open the door for a while to clear it.

The concept is very smart - a funky contemporary hotel cleverly inserted into a lovely old 17th century building in a lovely, not-too-touristy old part of central Barcelona. It avoids being cold or sterile like so many 'modern' hotels by its huge sense of playfulness, and actually feels quite cosy. Rooms are small but stylish, clean & bright, with a great sense of fun (soaps & shower gels urging you to steal them! Individually-controlled room mood/disco-lighting! Change the furniture to suit your needs!) The central glass shower cubicle and toilet (or the 'throne', as we came to call it) were unique, and a clever use of space. Our room had a balcony with comfy chairs & tables, albeit with a view of the balconies of the building opposite, but then this is central Barcelona - what else do you expect?! We loved the hotel's comfortable central lounge & wifi area, with excellent free coffee & tea choices, huge modern sofas and chaises longues. Staff were low-key but very friendly and helpful. The hotel's location is great: Born is one of the city's oldest central barrios but has a proper residential community, and the hotel is only a short walk from the Picasso Museum, Parc de Cuitadella and Barceloneta & the seafront. Its also only 15 mins walk from Las Ramblas but is nowhere near as touristy and feels very safe.

No Wi-Fi in rooms, but active in the common rooms for hotel guest. They also provide free coffee, tea, and little snacks. A gym as well, which we did not use because we know the definition of the word VACATION. I should mention that the rooms are bright, but the shower and toilet offer very little privacy because they are surrounded by either glass or midly opaque glass.

The bed was actually comfortable! We had a great balcony that was nice to sit out on with a glass of wine. There is a lounge area with free bottled water, coffee, tea, cookies and internet. The staff were warm and helpful and were able to suggest restaurants, assist with public transit and directions to the sights. The only point I'd raise is the showers... they are completely glass and right beside the bed.

Whilst missing breakfast, let's be honest, there are not that many great hotel breakfasts to write home about.

What do I have say about a hotel room where the glass shower not only forms a crude room divider it's also big enough to party in. In my book four people in shower is a perfectly aceptable number. Eh, mixed of course. And if you're a bit of a wozz then you can pull the drapes across to cover your modesty. If I have any complaints it would be that guests should have a member of staff show the way through the labyrinth of mood lighting and glass bead curtains to their room, then explain all the technology. It took a couple anxious hours to work out that no, it was not hotel policy to shower and use the toilet with the residents of the building opposite looking on and being close enough to shout encouragement. How were we to know that there was a hidden electric blind covering the balcony doors! We had a room at the rear of the hotel which gave us a loverly peaceful balcony. The Born area is terriffic for eating out. You'd have to stay for months to exhaust all of the small restaurants and walking out and about in the evening is just a joy. Look down any small ally way and there you will find an eating place. And it appears Barcelona has finally got to grips with the pickpockets at least in the Born area. The only time we saw any evidence of the problem was a group of young girls working the fountain in the park, as seen on Utube, are still there.

Rooms: Decent size and I really liked the feature where you could change the light. Not very useful, but fun. Shower in the middle of the room didn't bother me.

I'm sure anyone reading this now has already gathered from previous reviews and pictures that this hotel has a crazy colored light thing going on. Other than that, everything else is starkly white, giving the room a super-modern, clean and sleek feel. The lights are fun and the premise is interesting, but I have to say that it did slightly lose it's appeal as our stay went on. I really don't have many negative things to say about our stay, however. The hotel's basic policy seems to be that rather than have the staff serve you, you should already have pretty much everything you need. This was true for the most part, although it does lend to kind of an impersonal experience. We fully utilized the \"help yourself\" room which comes equipped with free water, coffee and tea, as well as a little loungey area and a computer hooked up with free internet. There's also a little vending machine stocked with juice, beer, snacks, etc. for a reasonable price. The location was great - right in between the historic area of the Born district and the park. Born is packed with cute cafes and shops, so we had a lot of fun just browsing around the area. We had a street-facing room which opened to a small balcony. I don't usually mind background traffic noise (living in NYC), but there was some construction going on while we there that tended to be extremely loud. I'm pretty sure they were even doing some work out there in the middle of the night one night, which did not make for a good night's sleep.

I loved the lighting and the interactive TV with its choice of music. The shower in the middle of the room was also very unique and romantic. The room, although it could be considered small by most American standards, was plenty large enough for a cozy weeklong stay. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was simple by nice. Our room was located at the back of the hotel, so it was away from street noises (which I'm sure were minimal anyway) but it did face an apartment complex that was undergoing construction (which, of course, I can't hold the hotel accountable for.) If you are a light sleeper, or enjoy sleeping until the afternoon, you might want to invest in earplugs. The room was outfitted with a thermastat (which we didn't notice until the third day; it was hidden behind the LED curtains) but we didn't have need for it. We opened the doors to our balcony and it was plenty cool in the room. The welcome package was an adorable extra, with cute soap and shampoo and candy! Also, we stayed in a room that was located next to one of the communal areas, so we were able to pick up the free wifi in our room, which was an added bonus. The free water and espresso was also very nice, considering we would often not venture out of the room until noon and needed some quick caffeine. The staff was not anything but friendly and helpful, offering us a safe to store my laptop in during the day. The hotel also has a bar/small restaurant located downstairs, which was very 'chic' as the name states, though slightly expensive (we ordered gin & tonics which were 11 Euro each!

The first time was in Sept. 2007. We planned a quick, 4-day trip in Barcelona, and decided to stay here again, as our last stay in this hotel was only for one night. When I arrived around noon, I asked in Spanish if the clerk spoke English. My boyfriend and I speak as much Spanish as we can (no matter how poorly) when we travel to Spain. She actually rolled her eyes at me and said impatiently, in English, yes, of course. It was a bad start. It certainly didn't make me feel very welcome. I found out that the room wouldn't be ready for a while, so I wandered out. When I returned, it was the same clerk, but somehow, she had transformed into a very friendly and helpful person. I was glad. She did a lot for me in as far as continually checking with the maids and trying to make sure I got the first clean room available. She was so helpful that I forgot about my greeting. The room itself was as nice as before. It was clean. I love the design. We both love the shower in the middle of the room. I don't mind the lack of space in the room either. There is no proper closet, but there is a small area with a little bar with hangers on which to hang your clothes. The hotel is in our favorite area of Barcelona--the Born district. In our opinion, it has the best bars, restaurants and shopping. I love that area. The Metro is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel, which is nice. We would get home late and take advantage of sitting on the tiny balcony, which was particularly good for people watching. One reason I wouldn't stay here again is that the bathroom/toilet room isn't very private. It's glass, with a partial smoky glass area for privacy, but the door has an open space at the top, and in addition, our door didn't close completely. The only other complaint I have, but it's tiny, is that the maids walked in on us, even though we were yelling, in Spanish, \"please come back later.\" We thought it was weird that they walked in because hall noise was visible from the room--another minor complaint. Those are the only complaints.

We accepted and were moved to a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony and some beautiful original features etc. The rooms are not huge, we booked a large and it was ample, but as the building is so old, I imagine every room differs somewhat (we saw 2 and they were similar sizes but very different shapes). The lighting is a real feature and a novelty! The bathroom and shower are really original too. Beds really firm (we both have bad backs!) There is a free safe you can use and the free refreshments are brilliant. Excellent location, literally 3 minutes from the Born area and all other areas lead off that too. We ended up eating and drinking in the Born area as it was more our style (little funky boutiques, jewellery shops, bars, cafes, restaurants) and very local. We ate in various places and would highly recommend each - Bilbao Barras - fab relaxed Tapas help yourself to as much as you want - great for lunch ( a bit smoky - there is no ban in Spain!). \"Cheese Me\" - if you love cheese and wine, you will love this! Then a lovely Tapas restaurant with loads of vegetarian options - cannot remember the name, but on the street behind Santa Maria church, down from the Gaudi Museum and opposite a Tea shop (it's black and white and modern looking). Excellent service, brilliant english, fresh, well made food. We loved all the wine shops that were also cafes too as well as the Chocolate and Churros!!! Barcelona is an exhausting city but there are so many places to sit and chill as well we loved it! The only down sides for us were the weather and the fact we flew with Ryan air who fly into Gerona, not Barcelona - although the bus system is VERY well organised, it cuts into your time there (1 hr 15 on bus). Overall Chic and Basic is V reasonable for the location, service, style, facilities and we would definately return.

We purchased the extra-large room with a balcony on Expedia. They gave us room #1. It did not have a balcony (they told us not all of the rooms have them even though I had emailed them before we left verifying that we got a balcony). The strange thing is that it didn't have any windows at all, which made it really claustrophobic! It had 2 windows that when you opened them, you looked out on an old elevator shoot. That must be how the roach got in the room! It had some cool skylights though in the ceiling. The problem with that is that they had a sky light directly above the shower. As I took a shower, I looked up into the blue sky and a man on the 4th floor of the next building who was looking down watching me take a shower! I couldn't believe it. He even had to put his hand up to block the sun's glare a few times. This made me mad. Needless to say, we asked to be moved and told them about the guy on the roof. No apologies, but the next day we got a room with a balcony. The bad thing here is that we couldn't sleep the next few nights because of all the street noise. (We were on the street with all the large garage bins and a yappy dog who barked constantly. There must be a dozen different trash companies, because they came at different times one morning to get the trash). We won't be staying here again. It was a disappointment!

But the bed was comfy the shower was so unique I just loved it. I mean to put it in the middle of the floor surrounded in glass with the beads hanging down and the lights below it at night so neat. The common area was nice, computer to use, free espresso, free water, and vending machine with beer! Also the bar was really great you gotta try the Sex in Barcelona so delish, and I do not like fruity drinks. But the best was the location in walking distance to everything worth seeing, the Born district is super hip with great restaurants and shopping, we know it is pricey and you can go to other parts of Barcelona to shop for much cheaper but oh well!

Also, it's only 3 minutes walk to the old mainline station (Estacio de Franca), which has direct trains to the airport every half hour. We felt it to be a very safe area at night (as long as you avoid some of the tiny back alleys nearer Las Ramblas), and very clean.

There is also free internet access, mini-gym (if you feel that way inclined when you are on your hols!), and the White Bar downstairs serving food, drinks and cocktails. We went for the smallest (cheapest!) room which was fine for us-see the photos-although some may argue they have sacrificed what some travellers may take for granted in other hotels for style and chic eg, the front desk staff were not overly forthcoming with useful information, the white walls showed all the scuff marks that have gathered, and our balcony doors did not look out onto a view that was anything to write home about (and they did not lock which may have bothered travellers more security conscious than us!).
