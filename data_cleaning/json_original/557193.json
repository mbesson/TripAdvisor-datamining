We arrived one day early and stayed one day after. While there we stayed both times at the Ramada Limited in Tukwila which is about 10 minutes from the airport. We arrived at SeaTac and called for the van. It arrived shortly. Some words of advice for those who call for the shuttle. Look for a van with a large red ball with white numbers painted on it. If it doesn't have this, it will be a van for the other Ramada which is also located in the area. Our driver verified that we were on the correct van as we boarded. We were somewhat concerned that the motel might not meet our needs as it is not located in an area where there are a lot of Seattle attractions. Nor are there other than fast food restaurants in the immediate area. Nor is it located in an upscale neighborhood. Everything worked out fine thanks to the manager, Jaspal Singh, and his staff. It turned out to be a very good place to stay. The staff is friendly, courteous, cordial, and very helpful. They will make the van available to you for a very reasonable fee to take you to nice restaurants that are located in the immediate Tukwila area but that are too far to walk to. We used the van the first night of our stay and tried a cab the second night. The van was much better. They also went out of their way to help us set up a self guided walking tour of downtown Seattle, patiently answering all our questions and what-ifs. We used the light rail system to get there. ($5 per adult round trip ticket and $2.50 for seniors. Such a deal. Taking a cab would break the bank.) The van dropped us at the light rail station which is about 3/4 mile from the motel and 25 minutes later we were in downtown Seattle. Taking the train will get you near the main Seattle attractions such as Pike Street Market, the pier, the Space Needle and downtown. You will also see the big sports stadiums before you enter the underground tunnel near down town. On our way back we called the motel from the train station and the van again came to pick us up. It took us back to the motel where we later collected our luggage that the manager had put in storage for the day and we were later delivered to the airport. All the while of our stay we were made to feel like valued customers. With regard to the motel itself, it is not a large one. But it is clean, well maintained and relatively quiet. Continental breakfast is of the coffee, milk, juice, oatmeal, cereal, bagel, English muffin, fresh fruit variety. It is enough to successfully get your day going. The eating tables and chairs are fair sized and comfortable. Underground parking is available and there are a few stalls in front of the building. There is a computer and printer for checking e-mails or e-checkins for flights. The rooms have older type televisions but they work well once you master the quirks of the cable provider. Bathrooms are separate from the vanity area which will make the ladies happy as it avoids steaming mirrors. The vanity itself is wide and has good room to put all your stuff. Storage is ample.

We checked out at that point. 30 days later we are checking our credit card statement and there was a $353 extra charge from the hotel. ??? We called and were informed that we stole computer equipment from our room????!!!!!!??? We were dumbfounded. They said they had proof. The manager told my wife nobody was in the room for 4 days and then the computer equipment (a wireless router he said) was discovered missing when the next people checked in. And he said that we stole the router and he charged our credit card! (can you spell fuming mad at this point??) We called the Tukwila Police Dept. and no police report was filed about any theft. We contacted our credit card company and they put the courtesy credit on until situation was resolved. We called Ramada corporate and filed a complaint. We called our relocation company (I was being transfered to Seattle for my job). We called American Express who made the reservation for us. We called my employer where I have worked for 30 years. A week later my wife got a call from the manager with a tepid apology saying in fact it was the people who stayed the night after us who stole the wireless router. Of course he forgot that originally he told us that nobody stayed in the room for 4 days and then they discovered it. He said our credit card was being credited and the next day the credit showed up. My wife coldly told him that he called us thieves and he should be ashamed of his conduct. In 30 years of corporate and leisure travel, we have never had such a horrible experience at a hotel. I think the guy thought we were out of towners and perhaps we would not review our credit card statement. I did not read any of the comments prior to mine until after this expereince was concluded. My employer says that they will make sure that no other of the 30,000 employees of my company ever will stay at this hotel. BTW, we have yet to hear back anything from Ramada corporate.

Though the room appeared fine, there was a large crack between the bottom of the door and the floor that let in light and cigarette-smoke-smelling air from the lobby, plus the room was cold. We put our kids to bed, then I tried to figure out how to turn on the heater. The heater was broken. I told this to the front desk.

At first glance (esp when we arrived at noon and was told that we couldn't check until 3 PM) the experience didn't look promising. As others have said - the surrounding area is definitely on the downside. (our daughter is a recent college grad and her new job doesn't pay all that much - so she wanted a bargain). I was really glad we (parents) barged in because the area isn't really a place that I'd like a young person to travel back and forth from, alone. We had discussed just cancelling and just paying for the one-night penalty (getting a nicer place in the City) - but decided that it was just a weekend and give it a go. However, when we finally got back from the City proper to check in (early in the evening) we were pleasantly surprised. The amenities are good - wireless access; hairdryer, fridge, microwave, coffeemaker service. The rooms were very clean (we travel in Europe quite a bit - and have experienced quite a bit of variety in terms of \"cleanliness). I have high standards and had no complaint about our rooms here. The staff was very cordial and accomodating and I have no reservations recommending the place if you are on a budget and want a quick get-away from the airport.

Since the hotel wouldn't send the hotel van until I gave them a credit card, I gave them my credit card number and was told to call when I got to the hotel pick up point (outside of baggage claim). When I got to the hotel pick up point, I noticed, with some surprise, that the hotel was actually located north of the airport in Tukwilla.

The women that I talked to said that they \"Required a 24 hour cancellation notice\". I tried to explain that I had just made the reservation 10 minutes prior. The women, who was the same women who took my reservation, told me that they were still going to charge my credit card for one nights stay. Sure enough, I just received a letter from the general manager, Mr. Jay Kim, stating that since there is no record of the cancellation (The women who I talked to at the time would not provide a confirmation number for the cancellation), my credit card would be charged for 1 day of a three day stay. Sine I have received this letter from Mr. Kim, I have tried to contact him, but have yet to hear back. Based upon the responses from other disappointed travellers, I would suspect the the positive responses have been written by people connected with the hotel, I am actually lucky that I didn't stay at this place. Based upon the way that they do business, I would imagine that repeat customers are not really their concern.

I've always been satisfied. This experience changed my travel reservation habits forever. Dissatisfaction doesn't even begin to describe my experience there. \"Stunned\" is more like it. There seems to be large confusion in Seattle about Ramadas. There are 4 or 5 of them. Most of them are called \"Inn's.\" Such as the Ramada Inn and Suites very near Sea-Tac. This place I'm talking about is the Ramada Limited in Tukwila. \"Very\" should be part of the name. I will never again book a hotel without knowing which one it is. And, I will never again stay at a Ramada. Just the fact that they have this facility in their system scares me. I stayed two nights, and wanted to run from there one hour after arriving but I was stuck as I already paid in full and it was late. First, the van they picked me up in was very old and didn't look business-like, and the upholstery was very stained. Next, it was well over 2 miles North of Sea-Tac, on the old Pacific Highway, in a run-down/transitional neighborhood. Casinos and \"smoke rooms\" in the area. Two miles North of the Ramada Inn and Suites (someone in October confused them in a review). Last, on arrival, there was a group of around 6 or 7 very unsavory (scary) looking characters hanging out on the corner on 139th, just as we were arriving. Only a few feet from the door. I walked into the lobby at night, after getting out of a medical conference at the Marriott-SeaTac and the lobby was very small and \"Court-TV\" was on full blast in the lobby. The lobby had a look of decay, with old, dusty fake flowers and unhealthy plants and ugly furniture. The place only has 38 rooms, so (lucky me) I got the room right off the lobby. Could not sleep as the lobby TV was so loud. I was too afraid to ask them to turn it down as I didn't want to leave my room or draw attention to myself, being alone. Decided to have a cup of Decaf coffee, and turned the coffee cups over and both were totally filthy. Had coffee residue (easily seen and felt) from the last resident, (not washed) as did both water glasses. Absolutely filthy. Almost made me sick. I turned them in the next morning and there were clean ones in my room when I returned late last night, but still? When I pulled back the covers to go to bed, someone either did not know how to make a bed, or they didn't make it --- from the last person in there. Everything was very rumpled and unkempt-looking. I've never seen anything like it in all my years staying in hotels. Furniture was very old, spare and plastic. Plumbing didn't work well, as both the bathtub and sink did not drain. I took a shower in the morning, and when I left the room an hour later, there was still standing water --- despite my attempts to get it to go down. Not to mention the hair and ground-in dirt on the floor. This morning, when I left for the airport, I showed up downstairs and they said the driver would take me right there. In actuality, he spent 30 minutes doing other things, while I both waited and made two more requests. Paid no attention to my need to get to the airport. Ignored me, while I was standing there. And, I had to get to my flight! Even with making reservations online, there were so many problems and \"misses\" with this hotel that I'm appalled and will definitely change my reservation habits. Evidently, they call it \"Limited\" because it is. Not to be confused with the other Ramada Inn's, including the Ramada Inn and Suites near the airport. The \"limited\" is very far from the airport and not in any neighborhood a tourist would ever want to visit. People probably confuse them because they are both on \"International Blvd.\" But, the other one is near the airport and is probably much nicer.
