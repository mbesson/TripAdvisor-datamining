{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Peace of Mind If you are expecting a four star hotel, it should be up to you to investigate. The accommodations are a half hour walk from the Duomo, 15 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio, Pitti Palace, etc. Excellent location for exploring.Lovely hotel transformed from a previous monastery complete with painted murals in the courtyard and throughout hotel. Rooms are basic, and very affordable and comfortable. I would definitely stay again. Room ratings in Europe are different from else where. A four star in Italy may be more of a 2 or 3. But as I said, very accomodating, comfortable.Church next door is very interesting - statue of Jesus with crown of thorns, and a statue of the Madonna at the left of the altar in the corner.There were families staying at the hotel as well as business travelers since it is a conference center. I have nothing negative to say about the facility. I was here to enjoy the sites!", "Date": "Jun 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR619956865", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "amolItalia"}, {"Content": "Another 4 star stuff up The travel agent said this hotel was something to see.... we are still waiting. On a family trip from Oz we were booked here for five nights, on a four star budget. I dont know how the agent got 4 star accom and Cinvitto DC mixed up. The CDC is a conference centre and student accom hotel/hostel. 1 star student accom and business traveller on a really tight budget would suit this hotel. Staff were good, rooms clean, breakfast typically italian, but why we were booked there is beyond me. Boboli gardens and some other tourist things close by, but overwhelmingly conference centre, and student bb based, my wife and two children seemed out of place here. Spartan is the word for accom and facilities, but the art work in the meeting rooms were splendid.A pity we stayed here in these circumstances as the business centre seemed well appointed and well used as there was a constant flow of suits in and out of the CDC, and the building had an aura of peace about them that was soothing as we sat and figured out how to get a refund from our agent.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR571800974", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d577234-r17063397-Convitto_della_Calza-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "577234", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
