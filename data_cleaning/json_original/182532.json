TV picture wasn't very good. The room didn't look as if it had been updated for quite some time. The heating/ventilation system was good; soundproofing from street noise not that great. The bathroom was a nice surprise - large and nicely fitted out with great toiletries (Molton Brown). It had a cheap, white plastic shower head which seemed at odds with the marble walls and floor. Only one bathrobe was provided in a room for two. The supply of Frette towels (one of the most upmarket brands) was odd. The hand towels and face cloths were thick and luxurious, the mat too. However, the bath sheets - although supposedly of the same brand - were thin and frayed around the edges. Wasn't thrilled to find someone else's long black hair in the sink though. The bed was quite comfortable and the Frette linens were soft. There was a coffee machine - the cheap kind you can buy at a drugstore. Also horrible coffee and Coffee Mate powdered milk sachets - yuck. I think they could do a lot better with that. We went into the bar for a drink late on the Saturday afternoon. The bar was pretty empty. The server was not very welcoming. Later, a polite request to see the restaurant's menu for that evening (it was not ready) was also met with a surly response. We were surprised to see the bar closes at 11pm on a weekend - a bit too early for this kind of hotel. As we were finishing our drinks at that time, several people came in hoping to get served and were incredulous that the place was closed for the night.

However, this is entirely unimportant, as the hotel seems to strive to offer the highest possible standard of service. We stayed for five nights, and were very sorry to leave. The room was well appointed and comfortable, with a passageway from the door to the main room, thus minimising external noise. The bathroom was of a generous size, with a beautiful tiled shower and separate bath. Toiletries were regularly replenished, and the towels were huge and enveloping. When we requested one or two items, they were supplied extremely promptly and courteously. Given the fact that we were staying the hotel over the New Year weekend, we expected a lot of noise and disturbance. We received none at all. The reception staff were helpful, and the concierge Natalie is particularly to be commended in making enquiries on our behalf, as well as giving extremely clear directions. There seems to be a fair amount of job sharing going on, so that doormen sometimes double up as concierge, etc., and this seems to work smoothly. We had to check out extremely early (5.30 am), and this went very smoothly; an error in which we had been charged for a bottle of water which we had not consumed was corrected with the absolute minimum of fuss. If you wish to drink tea rather than coffee, they are very happy to supply a water kettle in addition to the coffee maker. The only slight criticism is that the teabag offered has a very strange taste. All in all, we were extremely happy with our stay at the Metropolitan. All the staff were friendly and helpful, and gave the impression of wanting us to be there, and to have an enjoyable time. The hotel is centrally positioned.

I would classify it as a centrally located boutique accommodation close to restaurants, entertainment, shopping, tourist attractions and most important buses and Skytrain stations. All are within walking distances. The Granville station and the City Centre station are just 5 minutes away at a quick pace. Bell boys were friendly, helpful but not intrusive when we arrived. Reception was fast and we loved the large bowl of cherries to welcome us in the room. Housekeeping was very responsive; we requested an electric jug which was delivered within 10 minutes. The concierge was very patient and helpful with our enquiries. The most impressive of all were the front desk staff; they were friendly, courteous and helpful, remembering our names all the time. Nothing was too much trouble, going out of their way to assist. My son managed to book into this same hotel for 2 nights and when they found that it was for his wedding, upgraded his room to a suite. They even helped him booked a last minute holiday package to Las Vegas for his honeymoon on their system, which was better value than what he could get with travel agents outside. In particular we appreciated the extraordinary help and prompt services given by Kelvin & Natasha, very professional, efficient and yet friendly \u2013 truly top notch. The bathroom has been refurbished and quite large with separate bath tub and shower recess. The wash basin has plenty of bench space. The room size is alright for two but not as large as one would expect in North America. You can hear a bit of street noise in the morning but it did not bother us. The only drawback we experienced was the smell of tobacco smoke inside the room entrance. When we told the front desk, they immediately offered to swap our room but we did not take up as we\u2019re quite settled in by then. There are two PCs in the business centre for guest to use free of charge. When we got home and found a charge was made to our credit card after checking out, we were annoyed. We contacted the hotel and their accounts department immediately started an investigation telling us it was for Mini Bar charges. When we insisted that we did not consume anything from the Mini Bar, they promptly reversed the debit the next day. Quite satisfied with the outcome.

It was also slightly on a slant. I went downstairs the next morning. I was transferred to the manager Stephanie who was lovely. She told me they were sold out (we were considering getting two individual rooms). She offered to get housekeeping to put a foamy on top and extra padding. A bottle of wine appeared in the room with an apology note. Many of the staff asked how things were. The next night was much better. It was like day and night. I was told I was the first one to complain about the new pullouts but they didn't have them very long. I have a sneaking suspicion that they may have even went and got a foam topper for me somewhere as the first front desk lady to phone housekeeping was told they did not have any foam toppers. The situation was handled with class and attention, above what I expected. I have stayed at this hotel many times and always enjoy coming back. The rooms are clean and well appointed.

We were here for two nights and stayed on the 17th fl in a room that had two twin sized beds. The view from the room was of other high-rises and office buildings - at times I felt a bit uncomfortable since you could clearly see people working in the building that was right across, and I'm sure they could see you as well, but in reality, I'm certain the people working there could care less and we just closed the curtains when we were ready to go to sleep. We didn't bother to eat or drink any of the drinks or snacks that were provided at the bar, since it was for obvious reasons way overpriced. For example, the AERO chocolate bar was priced at $4, but at a nearby grocery store, it's sold for $0.99. We were surprised though, that the water that was provided there was not complimentary. I knew the mineral and carbonated waters wouldn't be free, but I at least expected the non-mineral and non carbonated waters to be free, but it was not. It's good and helpful to note that if you do want bottled water here, you will have to ask for it, and they will bring a couple of bottles to you room, during the turn down service. Their is ICE, but it doesn't appear to be on every floor, as we had to go to the 16th fl to get some, but there were three elevators so that was not a problem. The staff that we encountered here were all friendly and helpful. Checking in and checking out was easy. We didn't visit the pool or the fitness room, as we were tired when we got to the hotel and were out and about during our short time in Vancouver. I wanted to initially check out the restaurant here, but ultimately we felt it was a bit expensive and as such we went elsewhere to eat, so I'm not able to comment on it. I didn't know this until it was time to check out, but don't make the same mistake like we did and listen to the music channel - I had no idea that they charge you for that, at all, seriously. It's a good thing we only listened to it for around 7-10min, as upon checkout, we were told that we were going to be charged for around $11 or so for listening to it. Thankfully, I explained in all honesty that I didn't know that it wasn't free to listen to the music, and they waived the charges, so we really appreciated that gesture. If I ever come back to Vancouver again, I would stay at this hotel again, as we had a pleasant and positive experience here.

We've stayed at several 4 stars hotels in the downtown core and I would say this is in the middle of the pack much nicer than a Marriott or a Coast property but not quite as nice as the Hyatt or the Westin Grand. We got a pretty good deal on Travelocity using what I call their blind booking feature (if you're curious about term look it up on Twitter @blindbooking). Our initial impression of the hotel was great, as other people have commented the location is superb. It's across the street from the Pacific Centre shopping centre, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Canada Line and within a few blocks of most of the citie's theatres. We were working at an event at The Centre theatre and it was less than a ten minute walk to get there. Door men and check in staff were very friendly and efficient and we were on our way up to our room in no time. We almost always book our rooms using a blind booking website so we are used to getting the most basic room and were not surprised to find ourselves right by the elevator in a king bed room. I had a love hate relationship with the room. The good: Huge marble bathroom with a large shower separate from the tub. My wife loved the fact that there was a large vanity area with a stool and make up mirror that she took advantage of. We loved the fluffy bathrobe but there was only one! The room was quite spacious and well laid out. There was plenty of room for the king sized bed, a desk and a table and two chairs that would be very convenient for in room dining. Our room also had a small step out balcony that overlooked the pool area of the Four Seasons across the street. There was also plenty of glassware that we appreciated. There were glass tumblers, wine glasses, real ceramic coffee mugs and a cork screw. A small thing but much appreciated by us. The mediocre: The bed was okay but not the comfiest and neither of us liked either of the pillow options. The room was clean but very dated. The carpet was ancient and actually bunched up in areas, it clearly needs to be replaced. We never watch tv when we travel but the ancient old tube televsion and ugly stand looked very out of place in a high end hotel. Sounds were also an issue; although not obtrusive, we could hear the regular ding of the elevator as it stopped at our floor. I was also woken by the sound of voices from the room next door in the morning. The room we had looked nothing like those on the hotel's website but it sounds like most of the rooms have been updated and are much nicer. You might wonder why I gave four stars consider my complaints but I am factoring in the fact that I got a great deal. As well the location really is superb, the staff were nice and the bathroom was on par with those at the Westin Grand and the Pan Pacific. A quick note on parking, with tax it came to $40.00 a night (we didn't pay it but I asked). We parked three blocks away by the library (well worth a visit) meter parking by the library was $2.50 an hour and it's free from 10pm to 9:00am.

You cannot do that when the tub is child size and only holds a few inches of water before it hits the overflow drain. It actually ruined my evening. 2)The poarking. OUTRAGEOUS.

The hotel is conveniently located in the center of the downtown core. We took the Sky Train from the Vancouver Airport (hands down, THE BEST airport we've ever had to travel through) and the hotel is located 1 block from the Vancouver City Center station. It was an effortless way to get to the hotel. FYI - The fare was $8.75 on the weekday to leave the airport (airport fee included) and just $2.50 to return on Sunday so that was much less expensive than a taxi would have been. There is construction going on next to the hotel, but I had specifically requested a room away from that side of the building, and the hotel happily complied. The room was clean, quiet, spacious and well-designed with little things such as a light inside the closet, a large built-in ledge for luggage, and a small 'Juliet' balcony where one can step outside for some fresh air. There was a coffee maker in the room as well as an honor bar. The bed was very comfortable, the towels were plush, and the hotel also provided thick terry cloth robes. The four fixture bathroom was spacious and clean with stone tiled walls and floor. The complementary toiletries are Molton Brown, a high-end British brand. The hotel also has an indoor lap pool, jacuzzi, and fitness center. The website says there are steam rooms but we were unable to find them and didn't bother to ask where they were. There is also a business center which is fully outfitted and can accommodate several people at the same time. The staff is friendly and courteous, and the concierge was very helpful. If you're a good walker, most of the city's main attractions (harbor, Gastown, Yaletown) are an easy walk away. The Vancouver Art Gallery, the city's biggest venue for art, is less than 1 block away and has a very nice cafe with indoor and outdoor tables. The Art Institute of Vancouver has a culinary arts division, and their restaurant with students staffing the kitchen - Culinaria - is located around the corner. We had dinner there one night and would recommend this to anyone looking for an excellent meal for less cost than traditional restaurants. We also enjoyed several good and inexpensive breakfasts at Joyeaux Cafe, a little eatery run by some hard-working Vietnamese immigrants, located 1 block away on Howe St. toward the harbor. Eggs, toast, fried potatoes, and some fruit salad for less than $5. They also offer different types of pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) and what I had was some of the best I've ever tasted. The number of patrons - business people, students, and tourists - coming to Joyeaux at lunchtime to have big bowls of it attests to its quality. Our trip to Vancouver was very enjoyable.

One at the end of May for two nights and a return stay in the middle of June. I had chosen the hotel but had my travel agent book it along with our other extensive travel arrangements. I had done a lot of homework and knew exactly where the hotel was and how easy it was to get to it by the skytrain from Vancouver airport. As we were walking towards the hotel we noticed the building construction next door. When we checked in we told reception that we did not want to be put on that side of the building. We required a room with TWO beds. Sabrina the duty manager was very helpful and we were offered a couple of rooms. We decided on Rooom 912 which was at the end of the building. No view but nice and quiet. We were both greatful for her assistance. The room was lovely. It was late so we had a small meal (a plate of soup) at the hotel restaurant. Very expensive fancy soup but that was okay. We decided we would not eat there again. The next morning my sister was unwell due to a previous fall and needed to sleep. Unfortunately I had not put out the \"do not disturb\" sign and we were wakened at 9am. My fault. When she did wake I suggested she take a bath to try and help her back. The bath leaked and would not hold water. I phoned reception and asked to have someone come upand fix it but finally got tired of waiting and used a face washer to keep the water in. Not to worry. If the hotel is not told about faults they would not know. The internet did not work for our entire stay. This had been one of the drawcards for me staying there. All in all, everything was acceptable and we were happy to be returning. On check-out I requested that we be put in the same or similar room and definitely not on the construction side of the hotel. They had 2 weeks notice of this request. When we arrived for our 2nd stay Sabrina was once again on duty. This time we were told there was only one two bedded room available on the construction side. We explained that we had requested not to be put on that side on our previous visit and was told \"rooms can't be guaranteed\". Hhmm. Why bother taking down our details on our previous visit. She did offer an \"upgrade\" to a suite BUT one person would have tosleep on a sofa bed. At first I thought that would be okay, until we went to the room and the springs in the sofa bed were broken. A roll a way bed was to be brought in. My sister did not think it was fair that I should have to have a roll a way bed. After all we had booked and paid for this accommodation some 8 or 9months earlier. We asked to speak to the Manager and was told they were not on duty. Well I am sure they can be contacted by phone. Things deteriorated from here. I suggested that it would be good PR, as we were repeat guests, to give us 2 single rooms, thus we would each have our own bed. YES, that was okay, at a cost of $99. Not likely. All we wanted was what we had booked and paid for. A BED each. Well to cut to the end, we had started to check in at 6.30pm, it was now 9pm. We were now offered the Executive suite. Still a sofa bed. Beautiful suite but what did we need with a 10 seater table and huge living room at that time of the night. Still only one bathroom. I finally pressed Sabrina and she coughed up 2 continental breakfasts and two glasses of wine. That would have cost at least $68. Sabrina kept saying she did not have the authority to give us the two single rooms. What is the point of having a duty manager if that person cannot make any decisions in order to diffuse what had become a very upsetting situation. At one stage I asked for a refund of my money and we would go somewhere else, but the reply was that we had booked through a travel agent and could not get a refund. We certainly got the impression that because a travel agent was involved we were considered an inferior booking. My point is, for the saving of now approximately $31.00 Sabrina has made us very disappointed with the Metropolitan Hotel and not likely to stay there again. I finally did sleep on the sofa bed in the Executive suite and this sofa bed was almost brand new. This is a sad situation because as previously mentioned, the hotel is lovely (except for the bath plug) and in a very convenient location. I believe that when a hotel has construction going on around them, it should be obliged to notify guests when the booking is made and they can then decide if they will still stay there. Forewarned is forearmed. Would I recommend the hotel again, well possibly, but only if I knew the construction was finished. The word is that it had been going on for nearly a year but I cannot confirm this. Also, give the duty manager the authority required.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in Downtown Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "Sharklet", "ReviewID": "UR73296099", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while visiting Vancouver and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone thinking of where to stay.

Concierge helped us figure out the Canadian liquor store differences, delivered our things to our room from the lobby and was extremely friendly and professional. Our king bed was really comfortable and pillows were dreamy. We were unable to sleep in late (after 8 or so) on Friday and Saturday due to the massive neighboring construction project (they said it was going to be done in the fall), but what can you do...when construction wasn't going on, hotel was quite quiet. Had a drink at Diva and the service was excellent. Right next to everything and very walkable to Stanley Park, Chinatown & waterfront. Rented bikes near Stanley Park and biked to Granville Island and really saw the city.

BOOKING: Both times have booked online with no issues; our bookings were exactly what we chose. One word of advice is to check their promotions page when booking as they have quite a number of different packages that suit a wide range of tastes and provide some very good value. CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT: Check in each time have been very quick. Everything was waiting and after a quick credit card swipe we were on our way to our room. Checking out each time has been a bit of a hassle as we\u2019ve confused the front desk staff a bit. Our flights always leave in the middle of the night so we book, and expect to pay for, our room the whole day. The staff always seem confused on what to charge us, (even though we indicate we are fine with paying for a full night), and discussion ensues. Not a big deal, but a small indication of the level of experience the front desk staff has. LOCATION: Location is right in the heart of downtown, across the street from Pacific Center Mall and 1.5 blocks from Robson Street. It\u2019s super convenient and the main reason we chose this hotel in the first place. For the past two January\u2019s there is construction occurring to the building next door which disrupts foot traffic slightly, but we never found it a hassle. COMMON AREAS: Non-descript would be the perfect way to describe the lobby. In fact if you were rating hotel lobbies, it would probably rate in the bottom of any list you were making. It is lifeless and not particularly functional. We have never used the pool or gym during our visit so cannot comment other than to say that they exist. This place also has probably the most awkward car parks I have ever encountered. If the place was ever full you\u2019d really struggle to get more than a mid-size car into it. FOOD: Each year the \u201cDiva\u201d restaurant closes during the first week of January for renovations, so if you\u2019re going during that time be aware. We did have room service the one night and the food was decent, the one comment I would make is that the portions were HUGE. There are plenty of restaurant options in every direction of the hotel as well. ROOMS: We have opted for a Jr. Suite both times. The rooms are spacious and face out onto Howe Street. The bed is huge and comfy and the bathroom has both a tub and separate shower. I\u2019m not sure if it is the same for the normal rooms, but the suite\u2019s have quite a large amount of closet space; something that would definitely not be lost on a business traveler spending a decent amount of time in Vancouver. SERVICE: The service provided is decent, but certainly not outstanding. There is definitely a \u201cpretentious\u201d air among the staff as a general rule and anytime you engage them there is a hint that you are \u201cputting them out\u201d with any request. OVERALL: We love the location, and the rooms are very comfy. Also, we find the hotel is great value. We walked across the street to the four seasons to see there rooms and at the MET you get double the room for half the price. Outside of maybe trying the new Shangri-La next time, we will definitely recommend this place to others and will stay here again.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "GobiDesert", "ReviewID": "UR53125230", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel three times and every time is just as great.

Could not get early check-in, but hotel was very gracious, receiving our luggage and responding to inquiries about the surrounding area. Hungry and tired, we thought to perhaps hang out in the hotel restaurant over a bite of lunch. Prices were outrageous, but we were prepared to indulge that. No, what turned us out on unfamiliar streets was the breath-taking SNOBBERY of the restaurant staff. The restaurant was open, but completely empty, and apparently they wanted to keep it that way! Ignored us totally, leaving us standing at the door, looking expectantly back at the staff clustered around the bar. . . It was imPRESSive! We looked at the menu, ascertained that the restaurant was INDEED \"OPEN,\" so to speak, and finally left before our laughter overcame us. We were guessing they were 'WAY better than some middle-aged US woman with her grey hair in a bun! ! ! We wound up walking about three or four blocks out to the Vancouver Museum of Art, where a very attractive little restaurant was serving lunch - - and managed to score a little art, besides! The next morning at checkout, we wanted to leave our luggage at the hotel while we completed the (terrific) trolley tour we had begun the afternoon before. The head bellman said they would be happy to keep it for us, but recommended that we take it on to the dock and check it in, thus missing the crowds that would develop that afternoon. GRAND advice, and we took it, leaving us free to just sail through the rest of our day in Vancouver until time to get on the boat. Vancouver is a spectacular city, and we wished so much that we had scheduled another night or two there, so as to more fully enjoy the beauty. The trolley tour runs in two loops, and is the ideal way to hit the sights quickly. With extra time to get off and back on, we could have seen most of the city from that tour. Even so, we got a thorough introduction to the great beauty and fascinating charms of the city. A-Plus all the way. And we entirely recommend the Metropolitan - - just not its self-important, supercilious, snobby, snooty naught of a restaurant. Of course, if they kept up that level of \"service,\" they're probably out of business by now.

If you are a fan of Mandarin Oriental, that this hotel was up to their standards at one point might surprise you. Then again, over two decades have passed, and when it opened, The Mandarin in Hong Kong had small rooms as well (though recently thoroughly renovated and enlarged). Everything about this Vancouver hotel--other than your bill, potentially--is small. The lobby is likely no larger than your living room at home, and the guest rooms (mine was dubbed \"Luxury\" and was an upgrade from \"Deluxe) are compact to the point of verging on the claustrophobic. Think somewhere between a luxury cruise ship cabin and a dollhouse. It is a credit to the designers that the room works despite the lack of space. Nearly everything is built-in. . .the closet, the drawers, even the nightstands. While the room is large enough to accommodate a king sized bed, the television might be the smallest flat screen I've ever seen in a hotel room (possibly larger than one you would mount in your kitchen, but just), and the balcony is barely large enough for one person to walk onto. The bed looks more comfortable than it is--great duvet, but some might find the mattress overly firm. Nice carpet, good upkeep, umbrella and bathrobe are nice touches. A hotel of this calibre should have wireless internet, and The Metropolitan does not--but the broadband works well. Construction on a 50 floor residential tower next door means the noise starts at 7:30a most mornings--light sleepers might look elsewhere if rest is important--and the progress on the tower (just beginning) means that the noise will continue for at least another year. The 14th floor room had a view over gardens and pool at the Four Seasons across the street, but not much else--nearby towers are too high to afford the rooms at The Metropolitan views of mountains or harbour. The bathroom is floor to ceiling marble tile, and has a separate tub and shower--but it may be the smallest four fixture bathroom anywhere--in part to a barely usable tub, and a tiny shower enclosure with a head that might not be much higher than 6 feet off the ground. The decor was elegant 25 years ago, but the mirrors and smoked glass around the shower are beginning to date. There is a phone in the bath. If you like your luxury paired with spaciousness, this is not your hotel. I've stayed at the Renaissance, the Pan Pacific, the Sutton Place, and all three Fairmonts in Vancouver, and this is noticeably the smallest room of the bunch. I could overlook small rooms all the same--but can't overlook small minded hospitality, This is where The Metropolitan fails. My rate included parking as a promotion. With my plans changing slightly, I contacted the hotel as I'd not be using a car during my stay--and therefore parking was not something I needed. Parking, by the way, is $28 nightly, so four nights of parking is worth $112--not inconsequential. I sent a note to reservations via e-mail, and waited nearly a week without a reply. Finally, I sent a second note to follow up. A reservations agent then sent a note, rejecting my request for coming up with something of equivalent value--I initially suggested breakfast instead. Since this was worth over $100, I then followed up with the GM of the hotel, the once controller now acting as GM, Ms. Ahmadi. She had one of her associates call me back to yet again tell me that my rate was too low, and they had no interest in providing any substituted value. As it was now the day before my stay, I kept my reservation, and the hotel never did provide anything to substitute the parking. And the GM never deigned to communicate with me. Still hasn't. This small minded hospitality disappoints me. What sets a small hotel apart from the rest is the individualized service provided. it is not unreasonable that when a guest calls the GM, that this individual returns the call him/herself. And if the room package included, for example, a fruit basket and a bottle of wine--and I were not a wine drinker--it is perfectly reasonable, perfectly in keeping with a true luxury hotel, that I might request a bottle of sparkling water instead. A real luxury hotel, where hospitality came as commonplace, would make such a replacement immediately, without thinking--of course, it would reply. Failing to honor such a small request reflects the hospitality of bean counting--making sure that nothing is provided, and every extra is charged for. If the beans balance, things must be fine. Of course, this is a false economy when the guest experience is compromised. Which brings me to the next item that reflects the sad slippage of a hotel that had a Mobil Travel Guide Four Star rating but lost it over the past two years. The hotel charges guests a $9 \"facility fee\" per night. What, you might ask, does this include? I'm not quite sure, as the fee was never disclosed or explained on check-in. Believe there was some mention of internet (again the broadband, plug-in rather than wifi) or the health club--but the front desk agent was kind enough to remove it when questioned at check out. If it does include the health club, such a charge is even more offensive--as the \"club\" is the size of a standard hotel room, and includes a few aged exercise machines, some barbells and dumbells, and an exercise ball. The room is so small that a few more machines have been scattered around the south end of the indoor swimming pool. It will not surprise that the indoor pool is, well, small. Small rooms, small facilities, and a shrinking sense of hospitality.

Firstly I should say that we booked through a travel company and paid \u00a3150 a night, had we not experienced other hotels in Vancouver which in our opinion were better and charged less we may not have been so dis-satisfied. Firstly the bad points: It has been mentioned before but there is major construction work in the neighbouring building. We were aware of this when we booked but were told that clients who booked through our travel agent were guaranteed rooms on the other side of the building. However, when we checked in we were told there were no rooms available away from the construction. I explained we were on honeymoon and had been told this would not happen but they could not do anything until the next day. It wouldn't have been so bad but the lady at reception was quite cold and unsympathetic. When we got to the room it was overlooked by a big crane in addition to this the room itself was very dark and dated. The curtains had a pelmet which had a thick layer of dust covering it. We later discovered we were in an older style room, only some of the rooms have been renovated. The construction work began at 7.30 am in the morning and wasn't too noisey but certainly not ideal. There was also not so much as a congratulations to the fact we were on honeymoon (we didn't expect to automatically receive special treatment, especially since we were staying 9 nights but a congratulations off someone would have been nice). To their credit we were moved to another room the next day, although we wasted a morning trying to sort this out. The second room was better, it was a renovated one so had a more modern feel (like some of the pictures other guests have posted) and it was clean. It was still pretty small and quite dark, it did have a tiny Juiliette balcony but this isn't really the hotel to go for if you are looking for views. The other issue we had were the lifts were extremely slow. Its a pretty tall building and only had two lifts. These got very busy particularly around check in and out times some times we had to wait 15 minutes for a lift and there was no alternative (no obvious stairs). One day the doorman took us up to floor 3 in the service lift and showed us where the fire exit stairwell was from there. The hotel has a business suite which has two computers, however they are pretty mean with the internet access (only 15 mins free), having said that I guess thats not a huge issue if you're on holiday! The reception staff weren't as friendly or helpful as we'd experienced elsewhere (apart from Magic Doug the concierge who was ace!) We had a meal in Diva (the restaurant) one evening and although it was ok, it was nothing like we expected it to be having read the reviews and it was pretty expensive. Ok, so now the good points: It is a very central hotel so well placed for exploring Vancouver without the need of a car -public transport is excellent and most of the city is in easy walking distance. The concierge service was good- particularly (as already mentioned) 'magic' Doug (he does magic tricks) who sorted out all manner of daytrips and restaurant reservations for us and was always very friendly and helpful. The beds were very comfy and housekeeping seemed to change them and provide fresh towels daily. You also get a free newspaper to your door everyday. In summary, The metropolitan is a servicable hotel which pretty much does the job, if you can get a good rate then fine but for the money we paid there are better and friendlier hotels in Vancouver (we also stayed at Pacific Palisades-cheaper and better service and visited The Wedgewood- same price and really classy)", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Room, Functional and Aesthetic Design, Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "ccollins0822", "ReviewID": "UR38174988", "Content": "This hotel embodies a certain architectural era that I really enjoy.

The only issue we had the entire time we stayed at the Met was the temperature of the room. It was very hot in our room the first night, and we all had difficulty sleeping. Apparently the area was experiencing record heat, and the hotel\u2019s air conditioning system was not built to handle it. The thermostat in our room would not drop at all (the dial just kept spinning), and someone from engineering came up to look at it. He said that it would be a 2 man job and would take at least a few hours to complete (it was around 5 on our check-in day). We agreed that he could come back in the morning, and we would get up early and be out of the room by 9 am so he could complete the job before noon. Since the hotel is nearby everything, we were in and out several times, and it appeared as if no one had done anything.

We met Peg (a true local) and he hooked us up with the key places to eat/party. We can easily recommend Glowbal for dinner. We originally were recommended Sanafir and went there but they were full. You will need reservations. However, their door person took the time to call Glowbal and get us a table and then directed us there by foot where we had a great time and meal. How about that! I give Sanafir an A just for that kind of service! We then went to the Roxy (as told to by our \"local\", Peg) but got there too late (as told not to be). The line was long and I'm betting the place rocks. Instead, we went for drinks at the Four Seasons. Nice. The next day we did the Vancouver Trolley blue and red line tours. ChinaTown for lunch gets no recommendation. Look, but don't eat. Gastown is nice to shop/saunter in and Stanley Park is not to be missed. Two trolley stops are within a short walking distance from the Metropolitan. \"West\" for dinner and then drinks at the Cloud 9 rotating restaurant will make all in your group happy campers.

The bathroom had a wonderful large shower and a soaker tub. 2. The valet, check-in and concierge made everything a breeze! We rolled up to the underground parkade, the valet took our car and then check-in took a couple of seconds. Very fast. Parking is 28$/per day, but so worth it because you never need your vehicle and there would be nowhere even remotely close to park your car overnight. The concierge was great if you needed to know anything about anything! He found us a movie theater close by and gave us show times, and on our last day helped us navigate to the ferries. 3. The location was awesome as well. Very close to great shopping, kitty corner to an underground mall, and one block from the art gallery. A short walk to Stanley park and the harbor too. 4. If you need a computer with internet, its pretty expensive. First 15mins are free but then they charge you 10$ for the next 15mins. However, i believe WiFi was free throughout the hotel. 5. The pool was neat, offered interesting views of the city. The fitness center had everything you would need. 6. We did not visit the restaurant as it was too expensive for us. 7. I wish it had a spa.

The suite was big, comfortable with 2 flat screens, king bed with a large bathroom. Really a nice suite. Other rooms were nice as well. All quite comfortable with nice beds and decent decorations. Diva at the Met is the onsite restaurant and is well known in Vancouver for it's food, presentation and price (it ain't cheap, but the food is great). Marshall Mills is I one of the managers at the Met and the guy is fantastic. He responded quickly to us (as we live overseas) and help find and finalize rooms for all our guests. He was always available for questions and responded pleasantly to the most mundane of questions. The hotel itself is a smaller boutiquish hotel.

Work started at 7.30am and continued until about 8pm. A crane swung alarmingly close to the window every day - it just wasn't the view I was hoping for. Breakfast is horribly expensive and the service was poor - we actually left in the end. We were not greeted by the hostess as would normally be the case but simply firmly asked whether we had a reservation - I've stayed in a lot of hotels and I've never had to book for breakfast especially in a dining room which was actually almost empty. We realised that a family seated across from us had been waiting some time and still hadn't received any service so after a while we simply left. Very disappointing - however I can 100% recommend the weekend breakfast at Milestones restaurant either on Robson or down on English Bay, it's devine and only a third of the price.

Some restaurant recommendations: Imperial Chinese (great Peking duck) but the highlights were dinner at Vij's (Indian) which was simply one of the best meals we've ever had and Vij, himself, works the room while you wait with delicious appetizers and great stories; Tojo's for sushi (we ate omakase at the bar) - the food was local, fresh, and almost art on a plate -- it is very expensive but sitting at the bar with Tojo cooking for you was a treat and worth every penny. And finally, JapoDog. That's right, Japanese Hot dog stand - best hot dog I've ever had at any ballpark, big city hot dog stand. Check out Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations Vancouver episode -- we followed his lead and he did us right! Go to Vancouver -- our dollar went a long way, the people are happy and friendly, the food is good, and if you come from a big overwhelming city like Phoenix, it is a refreshing reminder that there are still cities that can be big and little at the same time.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nowra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest place for business\u201d", "Author": "DrLPN", "ReviewID": "UR21648496", "Content": "I stayed in the Metro in May 08 for business - I travel to USA and Canada each year at this time - and having a bad experience in 2007 staying at the Sheraton which was awful.

Most of the blasting that other reviewers complained of in previous reviews was complete when I stayed there, but I was on the other side of the hotel from the noise too. I was very limited in my choices of Vancouver hotels due to having to choose one that was near the location I needed to be at during the day, dog friendly, and on a government-approved list. That really narrowed my choices, but this one met all the requirements. When you travel with a pet though, I've learned you really need to ask all the right questions. I am getting really annoyed at having to sign a pet waiver once I arrive at the hotel that contains a bunch of items that were not mentioned to me when I originally booked. I was not given this waiver when I checked in, but rather in the morning by another front desk staff who told me that the housekeeper would not go into the room with the dog in there. Fortunately I met the housekeeper and she loved dogs so this didn't end up being an issue. The housekeeper was great with my dog and checked on her frequently during the day. This was wonderful for my dog. All the hotel staff were happy to see her and the concierge was able to recommend a nearby dog park that I wouldn't've otherwise known about. From a pet-perspective, this hotel was great (although if I hadn't met the housekeeper, my room may not have been cleaned). There was no extra charge for my dog to stay (nice), and there was no size limit on the pet (some hotels that say dog-friendly only refer to dogs to a max of 20 pounds). Every hotel has housekeeping issues (low pay and not being allotted a reasonable amount of time to clean the room are factors) and I'm a bit anal and detailed (used to work as a housekeeper) so I noticed that my glasses were just being rinsed out and turned upside down again rather than washed and replaced - GROSS! I called the front desk and was brought clean glasses, but the next day was the same problem. The bed was comfortable, there was a side bench to put my stuff on and the A/C was really useful because downtown Vanc is loud so opening the window made the room very noisy. The deck was typical of places where space is a commodity: tiny. The disadvantage of staying downtown is that some features that seem to come free with many hotels that aren't downtown (wireless for example) were charge items. This hotel had 15 min free internet, then had a fee after that.

After a few days we asked reception when the lift was going to be back in order and were told it was due to be fixed the very next day. This never happened and the lift was still out of order when we checked out 8 days later - I suspect it\u2019s still broken now! The Room \u2013 I had read earlier reviews which stated that the rooms had been recently refurbished (last year as I recall), but in my book a new LCD TV, phone and alarm clock doesn\u2019t equate to a refurbished room. The bathroom was very dated with a loo that looked like it had come from a 70\u2019s sci-fi movie, the bath tiles especially looked aged and worn with plenty of mildew in the grout \u2013 not something you really want to see after a long 9 hour flight. To round things off there was a good layer of dust on most of the pass\u00e9 furniture. The Food \u2013 \u2018Diva at the Met\u2019 or, as it says on the pitch board outside \u2018Diva\u2013licious\u2019 - they have to be kidding!! We ate there once and have to say that that food was mediocre for the price with service to match - it just seemed like the staff would rather be somewhere else. This cannot have been just my perception as every time I looked in at the restaurant (through the glassed partition from the lobby whist waiting for their only working lift) it was mostly empty, which was the case whether it was morning or evening. We did venture across to the Four Seasons, which has a far nicer restaurant, pleasant ambience and good food that is far superior to the Met\u2019s offerings. Building site \u2013 There\u2019s major construction work going on next door to the Metropolitan which is mentioned on a slip on paper placed in the room, and states (I paraphrase) that you may experience some construction noise from 7:30 am onwards. However, the truth is that the building work starts at closer to 6:00 am, so don\u2019t expect any snoozing. Phone stolen! \u2013 Beware when checking-out and asking reception to store your cases, your property may be exposed to thieves. It was our last day in Vancouver and we had a late evening flight back to the UK, so we did the usual thing of checking-out and storing our cases with reception whilst we had a final look around the city. It must have been at this time that my mobile phone was stolen from my flight bag as it was the only thing of any value not locked in my main suitcase. I only noticed it was gone when I landed in the UK, which is good thinking on the thief\u2019s \u2013 you can\u2019t do a lot about a stolen phone when you\u2019re 4500 miles away! You could say that I should have known better etc, etc, but I would expect that a hotel that markets itself in such a prestigious way would not have problems of this sort. I have tried to contact the hotel via their email address but I get a returned error message \u2013 perhaps their IT services are also manage by the same people who service their lifts!! Conclusion \u2013 I loved Vancouver and the parts of BC I saw, however, the Met was a big disappointment and I really cannot understand why this place gets such good reviews, simply because I found the hotel and service really below par.

I received an AAA rate, and it was the highest I paid with the least amount of luxury. The Four Seasons is close by, so is Canada Place pier with a hotel. The bathroom was nice. A very large vanity area with lit make-up mirror and a bench. The tub was extra-long, but nothing special. The separate shower was nice. After staying at other luxury hotels on our trip, this hotel was my least favorite with two exceptions. The sheets were very nice. The Canadian breakfast at Diva was great. I called the hotel because we were traveling as a celebration of a graduation; I was trying to figure out if I needed a rental car, so I asked questions and referenced my daughter's graduation. This is the only hotel that did not acknowledge that celebration. Every other hotel in Canada and Seattle, upon check-in, asked us about our trip; I told them about our celebration, and each hotel did something nice to acknowledge our celebration. The check-in staff and concierge are not friendly or eager to help. I did get a tip from the reservation desk; they told me to add the Breakfast of Champions to my room for $25. It would include parking. The valet only parking is $28; the Canadian breakfast comes with eggs, toast or croissant, bacon or bratwurst, potatoes, orange juice, and a pot of coffee or tea. It was very nice and the service was very good. The breakfast is $25 a person. The tip from the reservations person was worthwhile. The hotel does charge a facility fee that they do not tell you about. Most hotels state upfront if they have a resort fee. The facility fee is $5.60. I hope they get a new elevator.

We arrived into Vancouver from Seattle to rain unfortunately \u2013 well, they do call Vancouver \u2018Brollywood\u2019 I guess! We were warmly greeted by check-in and the concierge which was a great start. The hotel lobby is very clean and well presented. We just booked a normal room but I had told them when I booked it that it was our first wedding anniversary so would appreciate the best room for the rate. We were given a room on the top floor which was wonderful. It was so spacious and had a HUGE bathroom with 2 sinks, a large shower and a hydro-bath. The room also had 2 sets of patio doors which opened out onto a double spacious balcony with a lovely view over the city. The hotel provide you with umbrellas to use whilst you stay there as they know it can be rainy in Vancouver. Thankfully during our stay, the weather suddenly changed and they had an all-time record high for that time of year with glorious sun and blue skies. The only set-back the hotel has at the moment (which isn\u2019t the fault of the hotel) is that the Georgia Hotel 2 doors down are building \u2018residences\u2019 inbetween themselves and the Metropolitan. The building work didn\u2019t bother us as we were on the top floor of the hotel and, at the moment, the building work is still deep into the foundations. It will become a huge problem to guests as the building work progresses further or if guests end up being lower down that we were so just a word of warning to you if you are considering staying \u2013 request a room away from the Georgia side and high up! The hotels location is superb. It\u2019s directly opposite the Pacific Centre Shopping Mall which is soooo convenient. It\u2019s also only about a 5 minute walk to Robson Street which has fantastic shopping. We went to the White Spot (a couple of blocks away) for a big hearty breakfast to keep you going all day! I\u2019d definitely recommend going to Stanley Park and the Aquarium.

We asked and got a room on the 16th floor and the construction works didn't bother us.

The bathrooms were also above decent but oddly shaped, again one was much nicer than the other. The lowlight - our room faced the street and we were on the eighth floor (about halfway up) and there was a lot of street noise from both buses that stopped and started and souped up cars that raced down the street at night up until at least midnight and often beyond. This noise began again around 8 a.m. There was very little noise from other guests, which was great but we could hear the pinging of the elevator when people got on or off on our floor. Breakfast and parking were expensive. The workout area was so-so. The elliptical equipment was located in the pool area (which was small but fine to use), which was not ideal as it was a bit humid and noisy from some small children swimming. We did not use the pool but I think it was more than adequate. The weight equipment was a little outdated and a little worn. The location was close to the Vancouver Art Gallery and right across the street from the Four Seasons, which had a pool and japanese garden that we enviously eyed everyday. It is a short walking distance from Robson Street (overrated) and Canada Place. If you like a more urban experience with an active nightlife you will like it here.

The staff was very professional and warm from the moment I checked-in (very late at night). Upon arriving at my Executive King room, I noticed it was very clean and modern. The room included such amenities as an LCD TV, wired high-speed Internet connection, Molton Brown toiletries, small balcony, and light controls at each bedside. My only gripes with the room were both telephones in the room had operational problems: one phone did not work at all and the preset buttons to call the front desk, etc. did not work on the other phone. Also, the alarm clock in the room was difficult to set but on a positive note did include a CD player. I ordered room service for lunch one afternoon and the quality, presentation, speed of delivery, and professionalism were all excellent. The price for room service, well, as typical, was very high. Also, if you need to use a computer with an Internet connection, you can go to the business center downstairs during operating hours and use a modern computer at no charge.

We're only 2 blocks from Robson St. and just across from the Vancouver Art Gallery (if you're in the city the Raven show on Native arts is a must see). Because we have our car with us everywhere we go is only a 10-15 min ride (Granville Island, Grouse Mtn., Kits area). If you're into shopping then the Pacific Centre Mall is just across the street. The staff was one of the friendliest we've ever encountered. From the bell person, front desk to the concierge, everyone was very sincere and so helpful. One note about the garage though - it can be quite challenging to manouver up/down depending on your size of vehicle. If you don't mind paying the valet it would not be a problem. We had dinner at Diva and it was definitely fine dining there; we also tried Cin Cin on Robson and all of us preferred it over Diva for the food and ambiance (the staff at both are equally professional). We highly recommend the sablefish and tiramisu at Cin Cin. About the bed in the room. The kids loved their twin beds and slept very very well. Our queen mattress was creaky and sagging once you sit on the edge and we are definitely not big people! After the 1st night sleep my back felt like someone had stepped all over it the whole night. After the 2nd night I knew I had to phone management about it. Natasha (front desk) was very nice and helpful and sent someone up in about 2 mins. Then an 'engineer' was sent up as well to see about the problem. We left for our day's activity but can tell they had replaced the mattress by the time we returned to our room in the evening. The replacement was a nice firm one and we had no problem after that. If you're a shower person then you would really like the walk-in shower in the bathroom.

I would like to leave a few points for future travelers: I was traveling with two underage students. The hotel has adjoining rooms allowing for easier chaperoning. However, the fitness facilities are for ages sixteen and over. This is particularly upsetting since my students would have liked to make use of the facilities, and I work hard everyday to instill in my students the value of quality daily physical activity. It disturbs me to see blanket age discrimination especially when it comes to healthy wellbeing. I would much prefer a supervisory policy to their current one. Not able to use the fitness equipment, we attempted to use the in-room gaming system. Whenever we tried to purchase a game to play, the screen would turn blue and return us to the main menu. The system didn\u2019t work for us, but the front desk made sure we weren\u2019t charged for any of it. The hotel does offer internet. It\u2019s not wireless in the rooms, and it costs about $10 a day. It is however free and wireless in the hotel lobby. The concierge service was useful in helping us find our way to and from various tourism sites in the city. However, an error regarding the direct return bus (only travels in the mornings) could have cost us our flight home. On the positive side, the rooms are really nice. The beds are soft, and the bathrooms are enormous. It is a very nice hotel, and the staff was very pleasant and accommodating. They have porters and bellmen to open doors for you and carry your luggage. Like many of the reviews here, I must agree that the front-desk staff is truly excellent. They checked regularly to see how we were enjoying our stay. I also observed many other guests checking out. It was obvious they enjoyed their say. We were able to drop our bags off before check in allowing us to tour around without our burdensome luggage. The hotel is downtown and walking distance to many attractions.

With that being said let me move on to my review and, hopefully, helpful information and tips for future travelers to Vancouver. HOTEL: The hotel offers everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel and then even exceeded typical standards in other ways. For example, they offered free towels and bottled water at the front entrance for those guests \u201con the run\u201d. This may seem a very small gesture but it\u2019s in these that separate the overrated from the understated. They may not be huge skyscrapers with fountains in the center or grand chandeliers hanging in the lobby but they have the hospitality that you will remember long after you leave. Located on the 3rd floor is the recreation room consisting of a good size pool and a most welcoming jacuzzi after a long day's walk through the city. The gym is located in the same area as the pool but the cardio is in a seperate room right next door. The most amazing thing at the Metro is the squash court directly below the pool area complete with viewing area. Staff: From the moment of check-in to the last day of checkout, we were greeted with constant smiles and hellos. The front desk was very courteous and patient. Through other people\u2019s advice as well as those here on Tripadvisor, I have learned to ask for rooms on the higher floors (avoiding traffic noise of the city) and away from the elevators (also avoiding the noise from the elevator lifts). I have also learned asking for a corner room will usually grant you more space. Having this all running through my head, I asked the clerk for these and was responded to with, \u201cNo problem.\u201d The room we were given was on the 16th floor on the opposite side of the elevator and arranged in the corner with three other suites. I thought to myself, \u201cA suite? We didn\u2019t reserve a suite.\u201d Then I realized that not only did the clerk fulfill my requests but she also upgraded us. Just goes to show that it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask and sometimes even awards those that do. The doormen are particularly helpful when departing and arriving back to the hotel. They seem to always be there to open the door and greet you on your return or wish you a good day on your departure. There was one gentleman in particular that I wish I could remember his name that would actually dart from wherever he was standing to open the door for us. He is an Asian man that looks to be in his forties. You will know him when you see him, just look for the smile he always wears. Also, when you request valet to retrieve your car, don\u2019t expect to stand around very long. Every time we asked for our car, it was pulled around in a matter of minutes after the valet disappeared down the elevator. Housekeeping maintains the cleanliness of the hotel from your typical chores such as making the bed and replenishing towels and cloths. They also tidy the place up for you in the process. The first afternoon we returned to the hotel, we found all of our tour guides in a neat stack on the desk, my bathroom necessities were no longer scattered around the countertop but were almost perfectly arranged on a tray next to the sink. ROOMS: The rooms are just the right size to relax in after a long day of walking around the city. There is plenty of room for 4 people and plenty of drawer space for over a week of clothing. The bathrooms are exceptionally large and very nice. There is a walk-in shower as well as a bathtub. There is one sink nestled below a huge tri-fold mirror. A perfect mirror for one to ensure they look their best. The best feature is something that is lacking in most city hotels. The room has a small balcony that you can stand out on and take in the city, maybe even snap some photos of your surroundings without the obtrusion of glass. RESTAURANT: Metropolitan has a small restaurant at the front called \u201cDiva at the Met\u201d. It is an upscale restaurant with prices to match. The Salmon will run you about $30. We did not try it out since the majority of the menu is seafood of which I am not a fan. I\u2019m more a meat and potatoes person. We did read many recommendations from other online sources that Diva\u2019s has some of the best cuisine in Vancouver. LOCATION: Location is everything and the Metropolitan is located at the heart of it all. Gastown is just a short walk away and has tons of souvenir shops with many handcrafted Indian items. There is also the steam clock located toward the center of Gastown that is well worth hanging around at the top of the hour for a musical treat. The Cruise Ship Harbor is within sight from the hotel and is only a few blocks down from the Metropolitan. There is really not much to do in the way of shops but it is a great place for pictures of the harbor. We found ourselves sitting at the end watching yachts sail past and sea planes take off and land from the water. One hint for a beautiful scene right outside of the Metropolitan is to wait until sunset, walk left of the awning over the entrance and look down the street to the Harbor. The sun and shadow play off the huge sails above the dock while outlining the mountains on the other side of the water. Sky Tower is located a short walk above Gastown and is the prime spot to head up in for great panoramic shots of the city. If you travel during the summer, head here early in the morning before the summer haze has settled over the mountains in the distance. Robson Street is one block over for the shopping fanatic that has stores from one end to the other. Strangely enough, they have a Sears on Robson Street that is more like a Macys than the Sears we have back home. Stanley Park is less than a 10 minute drive from the hotel and gives you a great escape from the city to a natural preservation. Don't underestimate the park size, this is a very expansive park with a lot of things to do. Plan on 2 or more days if you want to see all it has to offer. Reflecting back on the stay at the Metropolitan, there is no doubt in my mind that this will be the place we will come back to on our next trip to Vancouver.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jenny013", "ReviewID": "UR3794519", "Content": "We stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel from the 25 - 28 June 2005 and again from the 1-3 July 2005.

First of all, I've booked my trip via Travelocity and on the confirmation page (which I printed out) has the wrong address to the Met. It lists it as 655 Burrard St, which is like 2 blocks away from the actual address. I was traveling alone and came downtown via public transportation, and 655 Burrard is actually the Hyatt or Hilton. If anyone at the Met is reading this, I would recommend that you call up travelocity and have them change it. For those who want to save a buck, Instead of taking the Airporter Bus $12 CAD or Limo/Tax service $40+ CAD, Just grab the 424 Bus at the airport and transfer to the 98B bus and get off Georgia St and walk like a couple Blocks to the Met for only $3.25 CAD. Now I'm not cheap now, I just dont like getting ripped off by these taxi/shuttle services. The Lowdown on the Met: - I believe there's only one entrance to the Hotel If there was a 2nd, I couldnt find it. - Hotel has 1 Bank of Elevator (2) only. - Hotel has 18 Floors, 17 and 18 I believe are the suites? - Diva Rest is connected directly to the Hotel via Lobby - Wireless Internet Access in Lobby Area (Free) - Wired LAN Internet Access in Each Room or at Business Center - Daily Newspaper on your Front Door each Morning upon Request Upon Arrival and check in, the reception desk was very receptive and prompt. I requested a higher floor and my request was granted without any problem or add'l cost. I also asked if they had a daily newspaper and without hesistation, the person who I was talking to expeditously went out of his way to get me one. I also requested w/o any problem that I get a daily newspaper on my door in the morning. Oh, btw: The hotel will authorize your credit card for like $500 dollars for incidentals, so make sure you have enough credit on your card, wouldnt want you to look embarassed when your card gets declined. My Room, on the 16th Floor. I was expecting a grand view of the city, but my view was obstructed by another high rise business building. My room was facing North West towards Stanley Park, I'm not sure if any of the other rooms facing in anyother direction has a view or not. I guess this was somewhat expected being in the downtown area, so this was no big deal for me. For those who want a view, it seems like you're going to have to find a hotel that goes up atleast 25 stories. Good luck. Anyhow, the room, was okay, plenty of lighting and clean. However, when I drawn back the window shade, I saw a big moth and it was flying in the room. I was going to call the front desk, but decided not too and it seemed that if I didnt bother it, it didnt bother me and I realized that the hotel window actually open as some other reviewer mentioned so during that night I had the window open and it flew out and that was the last I've seen of it during my stay. Having a window that can open was pretty unique for a hotel, but it can be noisy b/c of all the traffic in the downtown area and at 16 stories up, the wind was howling. So if those who want fresh air, its a plus. With the window closed, there was hardly any noise in my room so no need to worry about that. Other reviewers mentioned that there's a terrace, The room I got didnt have one, so no comment on that. The bathroom, very nice. It has both a bathtub and a shower. Next to the tiolet is a phone (if you have any problems, haha) and a knob that lets you listen to whats on the television. During my stay, I had that knob open to its fullest so that I can listen to the news when I'm in the bathroom and at other times I had it on the music video channel. Also, The floor was marble. The Elevators, I'm pretty use to 4 elevators in hotels, but this hotel only had 2. Since I'm on the 16th Floor, it may seem that it may take forever for the elevator to get up there, but in reality It takes atmost 1 minute for me to catch it. So instead of 15 seconds, that 1 minute may seem like 5 minutes for most people. I would recommend that they put in 2 more (if thats possible) b/c if the hotel was at 100% capacity, people will be bumbing into each other b/c 2 elevator wont be able to handle the capacity/demand. Internet Access, free of charge Wireless access in the lobby area. It also works in the Diva Restaurant. Connection time is almost instant with a pretty strong signal from the access point(s). What would be awesome if they could put in AP's on each floor, so that customers can get access in their rooms. Dream on People, even thou its possible and awesome, it would prob require rewiring the building with each floor getting 4 Ap's, so not including the 1st Floor, its 17 Floors x 4 AP's for a total of 68 AP's. So prob not worthwhile doing that, but having free access in the lobby and restaurant is nice b/c most hotels dont provide these services if any at all. As for charging for LAN Internet Access, thats bascially how it goes for every hotel. The Location, Walking distance to Canada Place to the North and the Ferry Service to head up North Vancouver. Walking distance to Plaza of Nations to the East if you want to catch some greyline tours. Walking distance to Chinatown/Gastown to the NorthEast. Walking Distance to Stanley Park, about 15-20 minute walk to reach the seawall on the northend. Walking distance to Robson (2 blocks south) for the shops. There's a drug store that also sells drinks and snacks across the street on the corner so I would go there to get your snacks instead of snacking on the inflated hotel stuff inside your room. For those who are coffee fanatic, there's a Starbucks and Timmy Ho's (Horton) on Dunsmuir just `1.5 blocks away. If you need help, you can talk to the hotel's Concierge, he seems very nice and from what I can tell, very knowledgable. I personally didnt talk to him b/c I pretty much did my homework on the place but I overheard him helping out other guests when I was waiting for my tour bus to pick me up. The Diva, like they advertise, diva-licious. Visited the Diva two times. The first time, I had the Grilled Wild Sockeye Salmon w/ Duck Fried Rice. The Salmon was nicely colored red (as sockeye should be) and rich in flavor and taste. For those who dont know, sockeye salmon is the best type of salmon there is around and is disingiushed by the deep red color vs pink. Sockeye can only be found in the wild and not farm-raised due to their susceptibility to disease. So when you see Sockeye Salmon on the menu, you know your getting the highest quality salmon avaliable, and remember if when your being served something that doesnt have that deep red color and looks pink, send it back and get a refund. :) Anyhow this dish I would rate a 10/10, but the presentation needs a little work. The duck fried rice should be in laid out in a bed with the salmon right over it, when I got mines, the duck fried rice was in a dome like shape wih the salmon right on top of it, so when I cut into the salmon, it literally almost fell out over the plate. The second time I had the Flat Iron Beef Steak, Had mines medium done. Came out perfectly, 10/10 for taste and 10/10 for presentation. I wanted to try out the RibEye Steak, but didnt have time, maybe on my next visit next year. Oh, almost forgot, the wait staff was really nice and attentive. The morning Hostess/Manager was really nice too, when I came down for lunch at 11:30am (yeah early) there was no wait staff avaliable so she took my order and even served me my soup. So to sum up: The Met Hotel: 9/10, Would get a 10/10 if they had 4 Elevators and if the hotel was a bit higher. I have no Comment on the Swimming Pool, Business Center and Fitness Center because I didnt use those services when I was there. The Met is probably one of the better hotels, but not the greatest. Would I come back here? I'll Probably try to find another place even better, if not, fall back on the Met. The Diva: 10/10, you cant go wrong with the food here. Would be nice if the restaurant opened up at 6am (I'm a morning person), but no big deal. Would I come back? Defintely, Yeah Maybe a little pricy/inflated, but until I find some other place with the same quality, I'll stay with what I know is by far the best.", "Date": "August 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowling Green, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDelightful hotel in Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "OhioRon", "ReviewID": "UR3750709", "Content": "This was our first visit to Vancouver, and we're SO happy that we stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel.

All these places are within a 5-20 minute walking distance. We had a very basic room, but it was chic, and very comfortable. The bed and bedding were one of the most comfortable I have experienced during travel. There was some street noise but it usually diminished later in the evening. The service was exceptional, with rapid and friendly responses to our requests. The food at the restaurant, Diva, was good, but the service was somewhat slow and the prices very inflated.

I then telephoned the hotel directly and booked a standard room at $259 Canadian (subtract 15% for price in US dollars). When we arrived, we were, without a request, upgraded to a room with a huge private balcony with table and chairs. The hotel is tastefully decorated in modern Euro-style with an Asian touch. Our bedroom was odd shaped but spacious and the bathroom was quite large, all marble, with expected amenities and lots of towels. The beds were very comfortable and our room quiet for ease of sleeping. All areas and furnishings were very clean without any noticeable wear. The third floor business center is staffed and there is no charge for the first fifteen minutes so it's quite easy to check one's e-mail. The spa, also on the third floor, seemed to be heavily used by guests. The staff was cordial, not overly warm, but certainly helpful, especially the concierge. Nice restaurants & many, many shops are within easy walking distance, as is the Five Sails area near the convention center. American dollars are accepted everywhere, at varying rates, but we used our credit card as much as possible to avoid transactional losses.

I got a very reasonable deal at luxurylink, and we were very happy with our room. The bathroom was fabulous, and our beds were heavenly. The room was serviced 2x's daily. Once in the morning and a turndown service which entailed robes on the bed, a bottle of water for each, the sheets pulled back, music turned on, and a little card forecasting the following day's weather (I thought that was a nice touch). On the weekdays, we received a newspaper outside our door. And we found that the hotel was in a perfect location for all of our needs (we were total tourists). Although, I have to say I was a little annoyed with reception when I checked in. At first they couldn't find my reservation, and asked with a snotty attitude if I was sure I wasn't looking for the Royal Crowne Plaza (OK I'm 30 but look 22.). But after seeing how well a slightly older gentleman in front of me (~40 years), I found that I received somewhat of a lesser standard even after they found my reservation. Thankfully my mom was treated well even though I was paying. Our breakfast was included, so every morning we ate at their restaurant Diva, which was a good deal as prices were pretty expensive for breakfast. We loved at Alane at Diva, who gave us his card when we told him we had reservations at CinCin, telling us he knew both of their managers. And when we asked to speak with their manager (Sebastian), he was so nice. He frequently checked our table to see how we were doing and then gave us a complimentary madeira which he had picked out to compliment the desserts we had ordered. It was wonderful.

From the moment we arrived I could tell it was a great hotel. The location on Howe Street is very centrally located which makes it easy to explore many of the great areas in Vancouver such as the waterfront, Stanley Park, Gas Light/Lamp, Yaletown, Granville Island, etc. The hotel lobby felt quaint and intimate for a city hotel. The front desk was very professional and the concierge (Nathalie) was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable - she helped us find some great restaurants and other things to do during our stay. The elevators were very speedy which we appreciated since sometimes they are slow in hotels with many floors. Our room was very nice (#1504), beautiful marble bath - all marble on floor, walls, shower with separate shower and soaking tub. The shower stall was quite small which was fine for us but if you are tall or overweight you may have to squeeze in. The Frette bathrobes and the towels were very nice. We also enjoyed the bathroom amenities. The room itself was a bit outdated - carpet was a weird peach color (very clean - just a bit worn and outdated color) and the curtains and furniture need to be updated. The king bed however was wonderful! There were four large king size down pillows, crisp linens, and down comforter with duvet. The room also had a Sony CD clock radio which was nice since we had some of our favorite CD's with us. Some of the rooms (including ours) have a very tiny balcony - not enough room to sit out there but nice to leave the door open when the weather is nice out. I would highly recommend getting the \"Breakfast at the Met\" package which was only $20 more than the standard rate and included full breakfast for two including tax and gratuity in the Diva at the Met Restaurant. The food was very good but the service in the Diva Restaurant was slow, cool, and unattentive (seems strange since the Front Desk and Concierge have very high standards of service). You have to ask everytime you want something (water, more coffee, etc. - the waiters rarely came by our table on either day to check on us - we had to flag them down constantly). We did have one problem in our room - once we put our valuables in the safe we could not get it back open. I called the front desk and they immediately sent the manager up to fix the problem - it did take him a while to fix it. He was very apologetic as we were almost late for our dinner reservation because of the problem. Right after he left room service showed up with a nice bottle of wine - compliments of the manager - very nice touch! I would highly recommend this hotel and definitely plan to stay there on my next visit to Vancouver.
