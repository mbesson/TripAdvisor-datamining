There are several B&B\u2019s around Paddington Station. We walked around the area asking the rates: Albro Hotel had vacant rooms and we got a twin room with 80 pounds per night. The manager told us that we had to pay the whole amount of 400 pound up front, and they would accept only cash. This sounded very suspicious: why would they ask us something like this? Is there something wrong with the hotel and they want us to pay the whole amount before we notice the problem? Or do they think we\u2019re some sort of criminals who will not pay the bill? (Not likely, because I gave my name, passport number and credit card number when we made the reservation.) We agreed to pay the first night right away and the rest the next day if everything would be ok. The room was in the 4th floor, no elevator. We were ok with that, but people with restricted mobility might want to get a room from the lower floors. The room was clean and nice. The temperature in the room was good and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom and the shower were clean. The bathroom floor was wooden, covered with thick plastic \u2013 a bit weird, but not uncomfortable. The street in front of the hotel is quite busy, but the traffic noise didn\u2019t bother us at night. The breakfast was good. In the breakfast room you will be asked whether you\u2019d like an English breakfast or a continental one. We tried both and they were both very nice. The breakfast ended at 9:00, which was a bit too early for us. After one night we paid the rest of the amount. When leaving the place we asked for a receipt and got it. We enjoyed our stay and would probably go back. The location was very nice, just one block from the Paddington Station. Considering the hotel prices in London the value was good. The only thing that left me wondering is why they want all the money paid up front. I see that other TripAdvisor users have paid attention to the same thing. Fix this, continue the breakfast until 9:30 and it\u2019s a lovely stay.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "\u00d6rebro", "Title": "\u201cFriendly host and staff.

The price was ok (90\u00c2\u00a3 or so) and the location good. Unfortunately paying almost 100\u00c2\u00a3 does not guarantee you any level of cleanliness in London. You'd have to go for at least 150\u00c2\u00a3. So while the building looks charming from the outside, the rooms themselves are not that great. The size is ok, but the standard is rather low. I thought the bathroom was particularly low standard. Breakfast is served in a room which is right next to the kitchen in the basement where smoke hits your face as soon as you walk down the stairs.

I just need somewhere cheap to stay for one night as I work in London and had a concert to go to that night (but live outside of London). I found Albro house, checked the reviews on Tripadvisor and saw they had a single room for \u00c2\u00a354 a night, so I thought I would give it a try. I booked through their own website which was quick and easy however the strange thing was that it said I could only check in between 2 and 4pm. So on the day of check in I rang up at 2pm and asked if it would be OK to check in at 6pm. I was told they did not have a record of my booking and that there was a problem with their booking system. Also, they did not have any single rooms left so I would have to pay for an upgrade to a double room for \u00c2\u00a375. I disagreed, told them I had a booking with them for \u00c2\u00a354 and he would need to honer that. He told me that he would sort something out when I arrived. I arrived at 6pm to the manager who immediately said in a very up happy voice \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you the angry one who abused me earlier?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No hello, no sorry for OUR FAULT, just abuse that I was upset that he told me I did not have a room. Seriously!!! Great customer service that. I was very taken back by this and all I could do was to apologise and say that I did not mean it to come across like that (I have no idea what he was talking about, I was perfectly nice, but told him he had to honour the contract) but to be told that I would have to pay more for THEIR mistake was not going to happen. So we head to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reception\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area. He tells me that I need to pay for an upgrade as its not his fault that HIS website is wrong. I disagreed of course and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153why should the customer have to suffer for your websites issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I even offer to skip breakfast if that will help (His response to that was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about breakfast so NO, it does not help your cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, again, not sure what sort of customer service that is). He tells me how this is SUCH a big issue for him, that he will get in trouble if he gives me a room, how could I expect him to give me a room etc etc. What I want to understand is, why is this my fault? I booked on their web site, go a confirmed booking and even rang to ensure that everything was ok. He eventually (after a LOT of complaining, go through books and mumbling under his breath about how much of an issue this was, says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153OK, I will give you a room for \u00c2\u00a354 BUT, its a room with a double and two single beds, you MUST ONLY sleep on the single bed, you MUST ONLY use one towel, you MUST ONLY use on bar of soap!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Seriously??? In the end, another customer turned up and his response was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh no, not another customer!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So getting onto the hotel itself, its in a great location, about 2 mins walk from Paddington station. The hotel is clean enough (please flush the toilet when cleaning the room cleaning staff, no one wants to see that). In the room I was in, one of the single beds was broken and the double bed was VERY used. The single I had was fine, if about 50 years old. The bathroom was OK, very musky smell though and the shower was just fine. All the furniture was at least 20 years old and showed it. There was a very small TV with only analogue TV channels, two of which could actually be watched. No clock or alarm in there though. I can not comment about the breakfast. All in all this would be OK if you need to stay for one night if you are desperate but EXCEPTIONALLY poor management of both their booking system and the onsite management lets this place down.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset", "Title": "\u201cTerrible stay, top floor with no lift, poor ventilation - felt very hostile.\u201d", "Author": "ratemerateyou", "ReviewID": "UR70159336", "Content": "Upon arrival there were no staff on reception.. there wasn't even a reception area in fact!
