We chose the 6-bed dorm type room for our first night stay at ABC. No windows. It was cramped and we barely had room to move around. There is only one electrical outlet so it was always a race to who's the first one to plug her charger in. But for the price of SG$ 21/bed, we really can't be choosers. We were basically out the whole day, so we didn't really miss our accommodation. It was just basically a place to sleep and rest. The pantry where the guests take their self-service breakfast has a well-stocked bread basket, 2 types of jams, coffee, tea, hot water. Bathrooms are clean, didn't see any molds at all. Towels are clean, ditto with the bedsheets, blankets and pillowcases. On our return from KL we stayed at ABC again and this time we booked the 10-bed dorm type room. Now, there is a lot of space to move around. We paid SG$ 18/bed/night. There are already 6 of us so we just paid extra for the 4 other beds so we can have the room exclusively to ourselves. In this room, there is a multiple electrical charger that can accommodate up to 6. Room and shared bathrooms are likewise clean. Walking distance to Bugis Junction, Bugis MRT Station, Sim Lim, Arab street and the bus stop. We were able to buy discounted tickets to Universal Studios, SG$ 62. We went to US on a weekend, and the price of the ticket, if bought on site, was SG$ 72. That's SG$10 saved. Cons: 1. Chinese receptionist (morning) looks perpetually a mixture of irritation, annoyance and anger. The night shift receptionist (Zeny) is more accommodating and pleasant. 2. More electrical outlets should be provided for the multiple bed rooms.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta", "Title": "\u201cSmelly and dirty...\u201d", "Author": "Futur88", "ReviewID": "UR118871428", "Content": "There was a sour smell in my room and the sheets and pillowcase looked like they hadn't been changed.

To make things worse, the Chinese receptionist always looks angry and is not polite. If your hostel isn't up to standard, the staff could at least be friendly!

I wouldn't say this was a great place to stay but if you don't mind living short-term in a small room without windows, it's an affordable place. We had a private room with attached bathroom at SGD$ 75 per night. Pros: - Walking distance to Bugis Junction/MRT Station - Restaurants & cafes around the area. Most are halal - Free bottled water - Clean bathroom - Lounge area with a TV - Cup noodles and drinks were available Cons: - Blanket was so thin and small for the both of us; we had to use a towel for more coverage - WiFi wasn't working on our first day of arrival - Bed bugs - Staff refused to lend us an umbrella when it was raining", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta", "Title": "\u201cGood choice of cheap and clean hostel in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "jesuisputi", "ReviewID": "UR114695353", "Content": "Good choice for female solo traveller!

The hotel is located at Bugis area, 5 minutes walk to Sultan Mosque and 10 minutes walk to Bugis Junction where you can take MRT. Buss access is vary, easily taken from hotel main street. 2. Surrounded by restaurants, mostly served indian and melayu meals, there will be no difficulty for you to find food from here, start from S$ 3! If you want to splurge a little, take a walk to Bugis Junction, you will find various meal there. 3. The room is standard with old bed sheet and furnitures. But it all clean that you know the bed sheet has just been washed. Each room has air conditioner but no window, so you can not expect for fresh air. Well, you are travelling so you do not need to stay at room for a long time, right? 4. I took private room so I get private shower but I have to share toilet with other guests. Not bad at all, cos they clean the toilet every day. Clean! 5. They serves breakfast: bread, margarine, jam and kaya. They also has tea, coffee and creamer of course with sugar. Very standard breakfast but what I love about having breakfast here is you can take the meal to the back or front of hostel where they put several chairs there, chit chat with other guest while enjoying Singapore air. 6. The host is very helpfull, they will happily tell you how to get to somewhere you intend to, and they even will have chit chat with you while having breakfast or smoking at night.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "ABC Hostel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1462978-Reviews-ABC_Hostel-Singapore.html", "Price": "$14 - $17*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3 Jalan Kubor</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">19920</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1462978", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9e/7c/9e7ca17266179a289ecc71e49c87b8b21large.jpg"}}
