{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Les Nations Visited Berlin on business for 4 days and for me the location was ideal. Out of the city but close to where I wanted to be. There was a bus stop very close by and the local buses into town were at very frequent intervals. The staff at Les Nations were very friendly and helpful. The room I had was large, clean and had all the amenities I wanted. There is not bar but the location was close to lots of restaurants etc. Only a small hotel but a good find.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR891144650", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Magrog"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234883-r4039687-Pension_Les_Nations-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "234883", "Price": "$101"}}
