We booked a quad room at \u00a3288 in total for the two nights in the room and continental breakfast (these are the new rates, as we were informed after we booked the hotel that the prices will be increased after April 2012). The hotel is only a 10 minute walk from Euston station or the nearest tube station is Russel Square. When checking into the hotel, we had quite a long wait at the reception desk before we were seen to, and the lobby area was very busy with various groups of teenagers - most likely on school trips. The staff at the desk weren't overly friendly, they looked bored and weren't very helpful. Our room was fine, quite basic and decor is quite dated, but clean and acceptable. Bathroom was nice and shower was good. The water flow from the taps was quite irratic; sometimes when you turned the tap on nothing would come out, then a second later it would spit a load of water at you and you'd be soaked! The beds were changed on our second day and our tea and coffee supplies were replenished. The breakfast is basic, in a large canteen style room with lots of school hall type tables. Breakfast included a choice of 4 cereals, fruit juice, tea and coffee and fruit. Cooked breakfast is available at an extra cost. After our second day in London we returned to our room and our keys were not working. We had to go back down to reception, and they issued us all with new keys which then worked. The staff had no problem changing our keys, which gave the impression that this has happened before - but I don't know! All in all, our stay at the Royal National was average, the hotel is in a good location and the rates are reasonable. The hotel is huge, I would say there were thousands of rooms, because of this the whole experience felt very impersonal, and if I were to stay in London again I would opt for a smaller hotel with a more thoughtful and personal touch. But if you're looking for convenience, Royal National should do you fine!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NorthYorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, basic but don't expect too much sleep\u201d", "Author": "Lenswift", "ReviewID": "UR126352967", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel on Saturday and Sunday night. 15 mins walking from Kings Cross, just round the corner from Russell's Square Tube.

Not able to check in before 2pm (I think this about normal). we were able to leave our luggage, free of charge with the conciege.

A job for maintenance crew really. The included Full English breakfast set us up for the day. For a hotel of this size the caterers managed the numbers very well. At check out we left our suitcase with the conciege, this time for a charge of just 50p. I will definately stay again if I am visiting the capital.

Do consider this hotel though if you are looking for a well located hotel providing a place to rest your head at a decent price. I did not personally book this hotel (and would not have chosen myself) but stayed here with my Mum and Sister as part of a theatre break (went to see Jersey Boys - Fantastic) This hotel claims to be the largest in London and it's not hard to believe. It is vast and crazy busy at all times with people permanently checking in. There was often a wait for lifts. As a result of this though there is a good multi-national buzz going on. The staff we encountered were polite, helpful, professional and smiley. As part of our deal we got dinner on the first night included. You could eat at various places belonging to the chain. We were very short for time as dashing off to theatre so chose the hot buffet within the Royal National. Basic nosh, but tasty and plentiful for re-fuelling. Breakfast was also included and there was hot and cold options. Breakfast did feel very much like being in a canteen but again, on this occasion it was just a means to an end before hitting the city. Oxford Street is within walking distance, but wear comfy shoes!! The rooms are basic, a very average 3* but It has all that you need for a short stay in london. Lets face it, you don't go to London to sit in a room do you? As the hotel is so vast it is easy to get disorientated in corridors etc. The corridors also look rather worse for wear, but it is understandable in such a large establishment which will have huge daily occupency turnover. I would recommend this hotel only if you are not too bothered about the standard of accommodation.

I was placed in a room that was clearly a closet at one point in time. I went back downstairs and complained and they changed my room after the issue with the hairdyer. They wanted 20 pounds in cash as a desposit on the hairdryer. After a transalantic flight that did not sit well. I was moved to another room but given a 6 inch pole with the key attached. The dryer was worth the sacrifice of having to leave the key. Even if the wait at the front desk was 20 minutes or more. The breakfast was basic continental. The customer service was extremely poor. Although I feel that London has very expensive hotel rooms I was able to reserve a different hotel, I was much happier at the second hotel. This hotel is cheap, no frills and the service is basic at best. Pro's the price, I think it may be the cheapest hotel in London since BA uses this hotel as part of it's promotions.

Breakfast at the restaurant is pretty poor and I single out cooked breakfast and toast for a special mention. Both are kept warm (not hot) under halogen lamps so you end up with an unpleasant warm breakfast on a cold plate and a slice of VERY dry toast. Restaurant staff walk around but as they failed to take a single used plate or cup off my table they acted more like security guards and created a very unpleasant atmoshphere. The woman at reception didn't even both to ask what my complaint was, she just gave me a form to write my complaint on.

The ''food'' at the breakfast station was like eating remains from a farm. We took the ''continental breakfast'', and the choice is only cereal, butter, jam, coffee or tea, juices, and the worst TOASTED bread on earth one could take. The toasted bread was ready toasted and prepared in baskets and one would take as much as he/she desires, but they were cold, streched like a dead skin and tasted like rubber. Just look at the picture I posted and you could see youself. And forget about some hot chocolate, they just won't give you.When we asked about hot chocolate, a pakistani staff acted as if we were asking for a space shuttle. And the last thing is the staff. To communicate with them it's like talking in dog language. They just don't understand your question correctly. It's either because of their nationality ( because nearly all the staff are not English ) or for any other reason which I couldn't understand.

The hall can get busy and there are a lot of people pushing you about but the food itself was spot on. We had a triple room and there was more than enough space for what we needed. There were Tea and Coffee making facilities, flat screen tv, power shower and towels were changed every day. Check in also isnt as busy as expected. Don't know if this is because we went midweek. There are always people coming and going but just request a quiet room and you don't hear a thing.

Warped plastic trays (the sort incarcerated prisoners have to use), mass produced congealing food (the bacon looked like it had been cooked two days earlier and had been left swimming in some greasy water to keep it fresh, and the vat of baked beans had a skin on them that could have been removed to make a handbag), and gloomy, hovering staff all made me feel depressed for the state of the British hotel industry.\u00c2\u00a0 I had never been so glad to check out of a hotel come morning.\u00c2", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cleveland", "Title": "\u201cterrible hotel\u201d", "Author": "lainebee", "ReviewID": "UR119856548", "Content": "arrived at this hotel at 1.45pm to be told check in was not until 2pm so we sat at the bar .10 mins later you could not get any were near to check in we then waited 40 mins in the queue .we got to our room very small it had 3 single beds you had to climb over to get to each bed .on the surface was clean then i put some clothing on the radiator when i took it off the back was covered it white dust and under the beds had a lot to be desired. a lot of comments say this was a cheap hotel i did find that. the hotel pub (london pub) serves warm drinks,terrible food, and really rude staff especially the manager . the english breakfast was ok", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buckingham, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe worst week end accomodation ever!!\u201d", "Author": "Caroline B", "ReviewID": "UR119791929", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel and thought we had gone back in time to the 70's the outside was shabby and the inside was just as bad. Felt like I was in the middle of a third world country airport. On arrival at the reception the gentleman was very friendly but told us that our family room had been \"overbooked\" and so then we had to have two twin rooms instead with interconnecting doors which although not the same we accepted as it was getting later. However I dont think this was fair as our hotel had been booked in June this year and we have two young daughters aged 7 and 5 years old so actually this was bad. Then he said that we had to pay for them for breakfast and I had been told this was paid for by the company but he insisted we paid without checking any further. On arrival to our room we were place on the 5th floor directly on the busy main road with ambulances, police cars and all sorts making noise. I know it is London and this should be expected but my goodness it was awful. The rooms were quite spacious and it looked like the carpet had been re done but thats about all. The beds were very lumpy and there were stains on the bed covers. The bathrooms were old and shabby with damp on the ceiling. To make matters worse one of the rooms we had been given was a disabled room and had red cords everywhere which were very strange and the bathroom was specially adapted. I appreciate that this is excellent for disabled persons and please dont get me wrong but it felt more like a hospital room than a bedroom for a relaxing weekend break. We then went down to have a drink before getting some tea and the bar was literally \"spilling\" over with residents and prodomintaly tourists it was like an airport lounge. The bar area is disgusting and really dirty it is not fit for children to be near. Then I took my daughter to the toilet downstairs and some person or what ever it was had basically soiled the toilet from the floor to the wall it was absolutely gross. I informed the reception area. The concierge were ok but they were very moody almost like they had to work there now because they wanted to. We hardly slept a wink and woke up eventually with two very tired and upset children. Then we had heard about the breakfast which had sounded awful and yes it really was. There was a queue stretching back to the reception and then once greated or \"grunted\" at by the waiter it was a rubbish breakfast and rubbish service. We were grunted at most of the time by the waiting staff and none of them spoke much English. At one point a young boy was running through the restaurant saying move out of the way I am going to be sick!!! it was awful. We nearly went home there and then but stayed as we were going to see the Lion King which we had promised our kids.

The best thing about the Royal National is its location. It is a half-block to the Russell Square tube stop (Picadilly Line) and 3 blocks (10 minute walk) to the British Museum. There are numerous restaurants (at least 25) in a 4 block area. There is a shopping center at the end of the street (2 blocks) with numerious shops, a drugstore, a grocery store, and an out-patient clinic. Breakfast is free at the hotel. It's a very basic continental breakfast: coffee, tea, milk, juice, toast (sometimes bagels), various jams, cereals, and some fresh fruit. Nothing spectacular, but acceptable. You can pay for a full breakfast if you prefer ham and eggs and such. There is no wifi in the rooms. It is spotty in the lobbies (they have two lobbies: north and south). Wifi is good in the Coffee Shop located in the hotel courtyard. Don't let the website fool you; there is no gym or pool or workout facilities. They have an agreement with a local gym nearby, but it isn't free for hotel guests. There are no business services available for business travelers. You will not have access to computers, printers, or photocopiers. You will have to walk to the end of the block to the nearest internet lounge for these services. There is also a copy place directly across the street from the hotel. The rooms: basic, very, very basic. Usually two beds, a dresser, a wardrobe, tv with basic local channels (no cable or satellite channels), a coffee pot. Rooms have radiators for heating, like most European hotels. Upper-floor rooms can get cold in the winter. Rooms, on hot summer days, can get hot and stifling--there is no central air. Most rooms have one LARGE window that tilts in or swings open a few inches, doesn't allow a lot of air flow. The beds are very \"short\" and \"narrow\" by American standards. Couples will find themselves sleeping in separate beds. Anyone 6 feet tall (or taller) will find their feet hanging over the edge of the bed. Did I mention the beds are on casters? Yes, the beds will move around. There is a pub attached to the hotel. When the weather is nice the people will hang-out in the hotel courtyard--it can get VERY noisy if your room faces the interior hotel courtyard. I prefer rooms facing the street. This is one of the largest hotels in London--it caters to MANY groups (tour groups from all over Europe and Japan and many US University groups). It can take up to 45 minutes to get checked-in if you just happen to arrive after a tour bus. The front desk staff is usually very friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a romatic getaway or are on a business trip this is NOT the hotel for you. If you are looking for a hotel with a great location and you don't plan to spend much time in the room--this could be the place you are looking for (affordable and basic).", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Island of Anglesey, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe worst hotel known to man - avoid at all costs!\u201d", "Author": "Robin A", "ReviewID": "UR119111686", "Content": "This has to be the worst hotel I have ever been in.

However, requests for dealing with these omissions were readily dealt with once the language barrier had been overcome (the majority of the staff are of foreign origin). The bedroom (on the 7th floor) was small, but adequate, and had a good view of the BT Telecom Tower, and was free from traffic and other external noise. However, the noise from the bathoom extract fan was something to behold - it sounded like a jet aircraft ready for take-off. Fortunately, the bathroom door closed sufficiently to keep the bedroom reasonably quiet, but the noise whilst using the shower etc was horrendous. The breakfast room was in all reality like a large, extremely busy, staff self service canteen, with a poor selection of offerings for the Continental Breakfast. The English Breakfast offerings were fairly standard, but the fried eggs were prepared in batches that were too large, resulting in most of the yolks being on the firm side. The tea (from machines) was very poor.

At the other end of your stay there is a small charge of 50p to leave your luggage - a real boon for us as we usualy travel via Kings Cross, just one stop away from Russell Square on the tube. A good tip to avoid the noise in this 24 hour hotel is to ask for a room on a high floor and away from the lifts.

There is also a decent leisure complex a couple of streets away with shops, bars and restaurants that are open until late which is handy. The negatives - the overall feel of the hotel is that it is tired and in need of redecoration. The rooms were also quite grotty - it seems they had not seen a thorough clean in quite some time. The hotel also seems to be more geared towards coach parties than couples. We were pleased to get free breakfast with our room tarriff, but could never get it because the dining hall was an absolute cattle market of people pushing and shoving and hogging tables.

The location of the hotel is very good with a 5 minute walk to the Russel Square Underground Station (picadilly line) and a smal walk down Bedford Way where you'll find restaurants with italian, chineese and greek food and all you need from Starbucks to grocerieshops.

You are not ripped of for the drinks at the bar or the vending machines (a glass of wine is \u00c2\u00a32.00, packet of crisps 60p, bottle of water \u00c2\u00a31 - these are all very reasonable. In actual fact I would find it hard to find a bar in Brighton that sells a glass of wine for \u00c2\u00a32.00). Room service is fantastic too. You can get a meal for \u00c2\u00a36.50. If you are going to this hotel - please do not be put off by people on here - I have stayed in 3 star hotels in this country and abroad and this is a very good 3 star hotel. You get what you pay for and it is very good value for money. I will definately be going back to this hotel.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWish I'd Looked on TripAdvisor Before Booking\u201d", "Author": "Sanjra11", "ReviewID": "UR115380900", "Content": "The day before arriving in London my boyfriend and I had a quick look on TripAdvisor to see how popular this hotel was with others. We had a good laugh at all the bad reviews and were prepared for the worst, this also made us laugh! We arrived via Paris on the EuroStar which the final destination is at the St Pancras train station. Only a $5-$10 taxi ride (depending on traffic). Took a while to check in as there are well over a thousand rooms. This is also the hotel where most Contiki and TopDeck tours meet, so if your planning a Contiki or TopDeck tour and would like to stay in London a few days prior to your tour... you may as well stay here to avoid packing and repacking. Location in Bloomsbury was ok, very close to supermarkets and convenient stores. If you like coffee there is Starbucks EVERYWHERE - there are 2 very close to the hotel. Internet was free and available only to use in the lobby, but it was also very slow. When asking questions at the concierge they seemed to only half listen and not really care about your request. Vending machines in the lobby were well priced, only problem was they didn't work half the time. Souvenir shop is over priced and the lady is rude plus there are loads of places to do shopping outside of the hotel. Beds were horrible, and creaked every little movement you made while sleeping. Pillows were non-existant. If we had used a towel as a pillow we would have gotten better support. Windows do not open very wide, and the hotel is non-smoking. Thing I hated most - After a last night, around 8:30-9:00AM I heard a knock on the door, even though our Do Not Disturb sign was showing. It was a cleaner, who told me when I was ready to turn the sign around to show that the room was available for cleaning.. I thought 'Thank you, I know how the sign works & it says do not disturb do you know how it works?' Didn't bother eating breakfast at the hotel after reading the other TripAdvisor comments, you can buy a full English breakfast from most cafes anywhere from $5-$15. There is also a Pizza restaurant in the courtyard of the hotel, displaying free wifi DO NOT EAT HERE! My boyfriend owns a pizza shop so we like to see what is out there, and this was by far the worst pizza we have ever eaten. We only ate 2 slices and left the rest. The only thing i liked was that the hotel was located about a 15min walk from Soho and about 30mins walk to Oxford Street.

You cannot check in until 1400hrs. We arrived at 1320hrs, asked if we could 'check in' to be told \"No, you must come back at 2pm\" I did and was greeted with 4 lines of people, some 10 deep waiting to check in. Took about 15 mins to get to the desk. We booked this hotel via an agent. There was a sign saying 'continental breakfast only' with the price of room. I enquired about Englsih breakfast, to be told there was a \u00c2\u00a34.50 supplement per person, which you have to pay for in the restaurant before selecting the breakfast. Because we had booked through an agent, we could only have the continental breakfast. We like full English breakfast, so decided to pay the difference in the morning. We got to the room, which backed onto Woburn Place. We had to open the window to get some fresh air in there. It was adequate for 2 nights sleep. The beds were very comfortable but the room was not the cleanist. There was black mould around he plug hole which I cleaned off and we found a pair of socks and an umberella case under the bed. We were on the 6th floor. The traffic noise was very bad, there seemed to be an endless flow of emergency vehicle sirens going down Woburn Place the 2 nights we stayed there. We went down to breakfast at 0830hrs, to stand in a queue of about 30 people waiting to get into the restaurant. Once inside, there was a guard around the cooked food. You did have to pay \u00c2\u00a34.50 per person first. In all fairness the English breakfast was good, but not a massive choice. I am glad we did not have the contintental, as all I saw were bread rolls, toast and jam. On a good point.....The hotel is in a very good location, near to all attractions....Would we go back there?

Good water pressure, but tended to spray down the bathroom, Free wi-fi in the lobby. Cleaning staff kept the rooms clean, but the halls were full of dirty towels and trash while they were cleaning. Definitely a no frill hotel and a good value if you are not expecting comfort, quiet or anything. Rooms would be hot in summer. The interior atrium rooms are quieter than the street rooms.

My trip started with unloading our coach, and having to step over a pool of blood to get into the front doors, which really weren't doors at all, rather, they were giant sliding glass openings in the front of the building. We checked in, and waited 15 minutes for the elevator to arrive. We were on the 5th floor, which reaked of mildew through out the floor. The carpet was soaked, and there was trash by the elevator, and the walls were stripped of their wallpaper. Our room was 3 singular dirty brown twin beds, on wheels that if you sneezed a little too hard, sailed you across the room. The whole room smelt like trash and dirty feet. The bathroom was a tiny room, the door did not have a lock, and there was an infestation of black mold on the ceiling. There was no plugs in the bathroom, simply a plug for shavers only. The towels they gave were dirty, and the toilet paper holder was a slingshot, that would frequently shoot across the bathroom when touched. There was no air conditioning, instead a window that opened a crack. Depending on which side you were on you either listened to police sirens all night long, or if you were over the court yard, people in the pub attached to the hotel. The housekeeping frequently came in when the do not disturb sign was on. When housekeeping came when you were not there, they only made your bed, replace your towels, and occasionally emptied the two tiny trashcans in the room. They did not pick up any other trash around the place. They towels they replace in your room, sit on the wet moldy mildewy carpet in the hallways of the hotel, they throw them in a pile and dispurse them through out the hotel rooms. At night, there is a large gathering of teenagers in the courtyard, usually break dancing. There is two pubs, The London Pub, which is attached to the hotel, but a public pub, their outdoor seating is inside the hotels courtyard. Then there is another, inside the lobby, located in the south side, and after it closes, usually it is full of homeless people sleeping on the tables. They do not lock the doors, if it is too cold, they simply close one of the big sliding glass door panels, and leave the rest completely open. For internet, I had to go to the other side of the hotel, the north side, and I was frequently disturbed by people smoking INSIDE that lobby. The breakfast consisted of luke warm milk, watered down juice, oranges, grapefruit, cornflakes, or toast. If you paid more for the full english breakfast, that was poached eggs, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, stewed tomatoes, or beans, all which was terrible. I started off eating that the first few days, only to downgrade to toast, and eventually skipping their breakfast all together. The only good thing about this hotel WAS it's location. There was a pub attached, and several little grocery stores around the area. The Russel square tube station was about 5 mins walk down the street and there was also a post office, a shopping mall, and the British Museum.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "my house", "Title": "\u201cNot That Bad\u201d", "Author": "sningbat", "ReviewID": "UR110587007", "Content": "Having read all the reviews on here I was seriously considering calling them to cancel or at least transfer to another hotel in the chain.We decided to brave it as it was only for one night.

Its pretty much pot luck which guests you are sharing a floor with but we fared pretty well.No coachloads of youths. We didnt go to breakfast so cant comment on that.

I stayed here last year and on both occasions my stay has been quite enjoyable. I have read the other reviews regarding the sheer amount of guests and the fact that there are many guests under the age of 16 and in large tour groups. This is one of the downsides of the hotel as it creates noise and means that the hotel lobby is constantly busy. On this particular visit there were only 2 lifts working as the other 2 were being refurbished (however we saw no one working on them during our stay). This created many problems due to the amount of guests staying at the hotel. There weren't enough lifts for everyone which meant every morning waiting around 15 minutes for a lift because everyone was going for breakfast at the same time. I also witnessed guests arguing over the lifts. I've never been a fan of their breakfast room which is basically a canteen everyone is herded into. It's very busy and loud and you spend more time looking for a table than actually eating it! Cereal, fruit and toast is provided as standard but those wanting a full English can pay \u00c2\u00a34.50 which I think is very reasonable considering you're in London and everything is so much more expensive. There is a cafe/restaurant on site called Blooms which we found to be very reasonably priced, it was around \u00c2\u00a37 for a 12 inch pizza which again considering you're in London, is very reasonably priced. It's also convenient because if you're tired and want to stay near the hotel you can dine here and then just walk to your room. The rooms are average size, I've stayed in hotels in London where the rooms are cramped and the beds are pushed together but this is not the case here, the rooms are spacious and clean. Basic facilities are provided such as tea and coffee making facilities, a TV and telephone and all the rooms are en-suite. The location of the hotel could not be better, it's central and the nearest tube is Russell Square which is on the Piccadilly Line which is probably the most central line. To get to places like Piccadilly Circus and Harrods it's only a few stops away from Russell Square. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London. It's brilliantly located, staff are friendly and efficient and the rooms are clean and spacious. What more could you want? The only downsides are the amount of guests, the lack of lifts (which hopefully will be resolved soon) and the lack of seating in the breakfast room.

The only down points for me are 1) The hotel is huge and out of the 8 lifts I have only ever known 4 be working, however the stairs are always an option! 2) The traffic outside is very noisey, regardless of the windows being closed, unfortunately I have found this to be the case in nearly every London hotel I have stayed in regarless of rating or class so I guess ear plugs may be useful!

It seemed that the school trips were accommodated on different floors to us as we didnt see them on the coridoors. We had a refurbished room on the second floor which was excellent and a decent size.The room overlooked the entrance which is a square courtyard. My partner is a Victor Meldrew who can be irritated by a ticking clock! and yes we could hear a gentle hubbub of chattering voices from the foyer until we fell asleep but it wasnt disturbing. When arriving at the hotel we were quickly attended to by polite staff. We went down to the breakfast room at 9.30am each morning and it was very quiet so I presume that it is much busier if you go down early . I am quite fussy about breakfast but I was pleased to find muesli amongst the cereals and also a choice of 4 fruits . We had paid for an English Breakfast and we weren't disappointed .There was scrambled eggs, fried eggs, beans, tomatoes, bacon, sausage all cooked well. There was toast and marmalade of course aswell . Even though my partner was on crutches due to a torn ligament we managed to walk to Covent Garden (10 minutes) and Waterloo Bridge (25 mins) the first day.

ZERO. As in, truly basic. But, if you're in London to sightsee and will only be in the hotel to sleep and shower, then it meets basic needs.

And yes, so is the bar area. So get out of the hotel and go see the city! What are you in London for? Go find a real pub with real ale to enjoy (and that would NOT be the bar attached to the parking/loading area). For the location, it is very inexpensive. That doesn't mean it's cheap, but try to find another hotel in the London city center in a decent neighborhood at this hotel's price. You won't. Just keep in mind that you get what you pay for. The room was clean. Most rooms have twin beds, so this may be off-putting to Americans. But it's rather common in some areas of Europe. There are no flat-screen TVs, bad art on the walls, or foo-foo toiletries. It is very basic. That cannot be stressed enough. BASIC. Pluses: Location. That's about it. It's within minimal walking distance to two tube stations. A little further afoot are major tourist/cultural attractions. The British Museum is practically right around the corner. Minuses: The free breakfast left much to be desired. Coffee, tea, juice, toast, rolls and cereal. For 5 pounds they offer an English Breakfast. The fee for parking was rather high. 14 pounds or something per each 24 hours. There were only 2 or 3 computer kiosks and because of the crowds in the lobby, expect a wait. And expect to pay 1 pound for about 15 minutes. The elevators are tiny and only half were operational when we were there. Takeaway: If you're looking for a hotel \"experience\" with perks and little frills, you won't find it with this hotel.

Room: Basic, nothing amazing but it is what we expected. 5 channel television and hot running shower. No view out of the room but again as expected. We were on the top floor (7) so we heard no noise throughout the night unlike other guests on the lower floors whom I heard complaining. The room key was an absolute nightmare, we were locked out of our room three times in total during our stay and when we went to get our lock changed the staff: 1. Didn't believe us 2. Said we werent doing it properly 3. Changed our keys so many times we had 4 different keys 4. Wouldnt call a locksmith 5. Demanded ID (which was locked in the room) When you have had a long day around London this is the last thing we needed. After the third time we took the locksmiths number so we could call him directly as opposed to dealing with the rude concierge. Food: Appauling. It was like feeding time at the zoo. People fingering all the bacon and beans, huge queues, no tables. Twice, I ate breakfast at a cafe in order to avoid the food. The staff were horrendous, asking to see our room card around 3 times in the 20mins we were in there. We were offered a free dinner but turned this down due to knowing how appauling breakfast was, no way was i staying for tea. Only ate at the breakfast hall in the end, didn't dare venture anywhere else. Staff: AWFUL. Overall experience: Wouldn't stay again. The staff were extremely unpolite, the foreign visitors pushed in the queues for the lifts, breakfast, recpetion, concierge, which was really annoying!

We had a free meal offered on our first night & enjoyed a lovely Indian Buffet at the Poppadom Express. I laughed out loud when I read somebody elses comment about the dessert on offer, which they described as a cake with some lumpy cream beside it which had obviously gone off. That cream was actually RICE PUDDING which I had as well as the cake & thoroughly enjoyed both - with no ill effects I might add. We had good service from both Reception & Consierge staff who answered our questions about directions etc both promptly & pleasantly. We had full English breakfast each morning & yes it was rather chaotic finding somewhere to sit, but considering the size of the hotel & the fact it was half term with lots of kiddies off to see the Lion King etc, we felt all the staff did well to cope as well as they did.

He commented that the machine must need to be refilled & immediately removed my weak juice & brought me another one without me having said a word.

Rooms were fine, clean, big enough, and served their purpose. We had a problem with our window and on ringing reception someone was with us in under ten minutes to assist and solve our problem. Staff were very helpful, very accomodating, and were always polite and friendly. Despite it being busy and housing a fair few school trips, the only problem we encountered was with two \"grown men\" in the hotel bar. We had initially gone accross the road to the nice little bar, where these two bafoons had started to pester us, thinking they were highly amusing. Due to them irritating us we had left and gone to the very nice- and reasonably priced- hotel bar. Unfortunately these guys were staying at the same hotel and also came across shortly afterwards. Baring in mind this was midnight, they were dressed as if they'd just walked off a building site and continued to jeer, holler and make comments towards us. When asked politely to leave us alone they became very confrontational. The guys were very drunk and unfortunately the bar staff were two lovely, but very small women. There were no 'security ' or anything to assist us. Anyway, not the hotels' fault, and it was quite clear they were wasted, and on speaking to the bar staff were under watchful eyes. Slept well, some noise but did not disturb us sleeping. Went over for the breakfast which was included with our price. No complaints, self service, as much or as little as you want. Despite reviews, we couldn't complain about the food, the service or the staff. The breakfast was more than edible and it was all freshly cooked and piping hot. Will most definitely return and stay here again. Yes if you've plenty of money and are used to fine dining, then no, this wont suit you.

Unfortunately the wife's uncle had just recently discovered the trip adviser website and was all doom and gloom about the hotel even before he had set foot in the place!! We arrived shortly after 2pm and found ourselves in the middle of a hotel reception that was as busy as terminal 5 in Heathrow Airport. There was a mass of people waiting to check in and there was no orderly queues - it was a free for all just like boarding an Easy Jet flight if you haven't paid extra for the speedy boarding pass. There was a right mixture of people waiting to check in - from families, coach parties, schools, groups of aliens with either fluffy or bobbly antennae protruding from their heads and middle aged princesses with tiaras hoping to find their frog princes. When we eventually got to the reception the staff were friendly & polite and we were off to our rooms within 5 minutes. As luck would have it Mr Doom & Gloom (aka the wife's uncle) got a room that had been recently refurbished. The room was first class - it was all freshly decorated with new carpet, a new bathroom, new bedroom furniture, nice spotlights above the bed and had a lovely flat screen television. Unfortunately our room had not been part of the recent refurbish but to be fair the room was clean and tidy. Our bedroom was right on the main road which I thought would be a problem at night when we were trying to sleep but we never heard the traffic. The wife's aunt & uncle's room was located above the court yard and they were aware of the noise of people coming & going from the hotel during the night but it didn't disturb their sleeping too much. The rooms were cleaned every day even when there was no request left hanging from the door handle. Now the breakfast in the morning - if we had known that it was going to be so bad we would have stayed in bed! The breakfast room took me back to my school days - it was like our school dining hall without the school monitors. If you are up early enough then you won't have to queue in the hallway waiting for a free table. But I tell you it is not worth the wait. The food was terrible - the breakfast rolls were brick hard, the toast was far from crisp in fact it was the first time I have had chewy toast, the tea was like tar and the fresh orange juice was far from fresh. The breakfast cereals were they only thing that was edible. There was no choices of cold meats, cheese, pastries or croissants. It was very basic - cereals, rolls, toast, butter/jam/marmalade, tea/coffee/fresh fruit juice & some grapefruits. Not a good selection for what is described as a 'Continental breakfast'. I have has a lot better continental breakfasts in other hotels. One thing the Royal National does have going for it is the location. Russell Square Underground station is just round the corner, there are plenty of restaurants/cafes and shops in the area, the British Museum is a short walk away and other attractions such as Covent Garden, Oxford Street etc are within walking distance. The hotel is if anything too large. The wife's uncle actually got lost a couple of times trying to get to his room and likened it to being a rat in a maze. The rooms in themselves are fine but the hallways are shabby and are in need of some upgrading. We knew where our room was thanks to the big paint footprint at the start of our hallway. Although there was groups of school children we did not hear any noise from them as they were located in the other end of the hotel which was a relief as the wife needs her sleep! If you are looking for a short break in London then the Royal National is good value for money. What would make this a gem would be for the Imperial London Hotel Group to invest in a total refurbishment of this hotel and to improve the standand of their breakfasts. Add this to the location then the hotel would be first class.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and price if that is more important than ammenities\u201d", "Author": "JillGW", "ReviewID": "UR96774092", "Content": "This hotel had a great location near the tube and within walking distance of the British Museum, West End, and Piccadilly Circus.

The room was very basic and not very clean, the pillow case had a hole in it and radiator looked filthy (see pictures). The bathroom was even worst with the extract grille above the bath was almost blocked with hair and dust. The bathroom floor looked like it was only cleaned in the middle of the room with the floor behind the door, toilet and sink looking dirty.

The staff at the hotel were very friendly I arrived early before check in time the person at the front desk told me that i could leave my bags there for free and they would lock them up. I was impressed the offered that as other europe hotels did not. There was also a lot of restaurants/shops in walking distances as well ast the bristish museum (which was free to enter) The hotel also offerred a lot of sight seeing options and they told you what you could do on your free time. The hotel was right across a lovely park (russell Sq). The hotel room was small but I expected that as europe seems to always have small rooms. I stayed in a one bed and a two bedroom. Both were good. Also if you are landing at heathrow you can take the tube all the way to russell sq than its about a 5 mins walk maybe less. I would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cProbably the WORST hotel I stayed at\u201d", "Author": "lc96", "ReviewID": "UR90535025", "Content": "The staff there were unfriendly and rude!

We went down to Reception and asked the woman behind the desk what was up with the Pizza number to which she replied \"Oh, I don't know. It's old\" and threw it in the bin. Admittedly, after that she was helpful and gave us a number for a nearby Pizza shop and the address so we could go. We then went out for the evening and came back and fell asleep. The next morning, we decided to skip breakfast and the Concierge desk were very helpful with giving us directions to all the nearest Tourist Attractions. The rest of the day was uneventful, however the Restaurant on the evening wasn't the nicest so we decided to bypass this and go for the nearby Pizza Cafe yet again. The last morning of our stay, we went down for Breakfast and were asked for our \"slip\". Nobody had mentioned any \"slip\" on check-in, however we had recieved a piece of paper covered in what looked like the Terms and Conditions of the hotel. When replying we didn't know what the slip was, we were told to just go through. We got our slices of cold, cardboard-like toast and headed across to the Full English Breakfast buffet. The woman obviously working that area proceeded to shout and grunt at us and shooed us off to go sit down. As we tried to sit down, a tall Indian man who I assumed was a member of staff began saying that we can't sit where we'd sat, and tried taking our trays and moving us. I replied that I wasn't moving and to get off my tray to which he walked off and began talking to his colleagues all while pointing at us.

Clean sheets, tv, tea and coffee, Bathroom had seen better days but the shower was hugely powerful. No shampoo etc provided (I brought my own) There was a hairdryer. Generally clean but evidence of shoddy cleaning in those harder to reach areas, and built up grime in the overflow etc. Nothing too offputting though.Secondly, the breakfast. We went down about 8 o'clock and found seating no problem (this was a weekend) although I could see that later on it became quite bssy..I found the breakfast fantastic - they had porridge! The bacon was good quality, the toast was crisp, the coffee excellent, it really set us up for the day. I had a nice chat with the lady on duty who was lovely and she remembered us the next day! Thirdly, the noise. This hotel is in a popular and populated district which is open all hours. It is going to be noisy.

I'd definitely use again , and if you prepare for noise and eat elsewhere, then you cant really fault it at only \u00c2\u00a370 for a single room in London Oh and the shower was just great. very powerful, like a little body massage in the morning!", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo", "Title": "\u201cMake it your last choice !!\u201d", "Author": "Egyptian-Explorer", "ReviewID": "UR85483553", "Content": "I stayed there for 7 nights; I think the reviewers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments covered most of the hotel conditions: very good location (but not the best) with Easy connections to Heathrow airport through the underground (Piccadilly line) or to central shopping area through the nearby buses, woeful staff (may give them some excuse for dealing with such incredible number of guests occupying more than 1600 rooms!!), therefore, you will not get the a good guest treatment or feel welcomed in this busy overcrowded hotel (The reception hall makes you feel like in an underground station, arriving and departure groups always there throughout the day!), poor breakfast if your stay is on English breakfast basis. Going to the guest rooms: average, clean enough despite the bad reviews regarding that(maybe we were lucky), having no mini-bar in most of the rooms, no hairdryer (order against deposit !!), shampoo, and shower gel (bring them with you if essential), the wash basin has two separate (cold and hot) water taps (No mixer, so, you have to use your hand to mix!!). If you will leave late and want to keep your luggage in the hotel, you have to stand in a long queue leading to the luggage room and pay 50 pence for each bag. The most important issue is the terrible sleep quality because of the continuous noise coming from the street (no wall sound insulation or double glazing for window or good accessories for room door) in addition to the noise coming from the distribution corridor either from moving or drunken guys returning very late at night, and sometimes because of the housekeeping staff shouting and moving things aggressively at the early hours in the morning.

They didn't really tell us how breakfast worked but we were able to work it out. The room was pretty average- we got what we paid for and it was clean. Couldn't complain! It's ideal if you are going to be out and about all day and are just looking for a place to sleep at a cheap price. However, upon returning from our second day in London from the theatre (so lateish) we discovered a black bag full of rubbish had been left in our room, presumably by the cleaners. We were so tired we just left it and it had gone the next day. One thing that made the whole experience a bit less enjoyable was the way in which we were often spoken to by staff. On one occasion, me and my friend were walking down to breakfast and simply walking through the hall. There had been some kid of spillage and there was a yellow sign indicating this. The hallway was narrow so we did our best to avoid the spill. The member of staff however, shouted at us very rudely for walking over it. I work in a hotel and I have never once felt it would be even a little bit acceptable to shout in a customer's face. On a more positive note- some of the staff were more friendly and perhaps this was just an isolated incident.

First of all, the WIFI has been down for months and they don't know when it will be back. It irks me to no end when a feature is promised and it isn't available. And they have catches on other amenities too - you want a hair dryer? 20 pound deposit. I need that money to spend, not put into some deposit. You want to iron your clothes? Walk to the ghetto room where irons are, you don't get your own. This feature feels like a hostel, and i didn't pay enough attention to the iron which had something burned onto it, and it ruined my shirt. Like I said, ghetto. They tell you they have a gym - not really, it's a gym up the street, not in the hotel, and a day pass costs 10 pounds. So like i said, they tell you they have amenities, but everything has a catch. And lastly, get up early because this is the loudest hotel I have ever been in my life - and not because of the guests! The cleaning staff sound like they are kicking the crap out of the rooms!

On the Wednesday of our stay me and my partner left our hotel room at 8.30am for breakfast, before leaving however I moved our personal belongings and put them in the bedside table, all except a silver diamond ring which was left on the dressing table beside the television. Within the time we had been down to breakfast the housekeepers had been to our room and tidied our bedding and towels, however upon arrival of our hotel room I noticed that my ring had disappeared. I immediately reported it to reception who told me to speak to the housekeeping office on the first floor. When speaking to a lady within the office I simply asked if any of the housekeepers had came across the ring or if there was a possibility that it could have been knocked off the table into the rubbish or something along those lines. The lady assured me she would be in touch, within 5 minutes of being back at my room another housekeeper opened my door without knocking and began asking what the problem was, she then disappeared out of the room and re-entered with a blonde lady who began to be very rude and abrupt with me and my partner that she had not even cleaned or been in my room yet, however this was not true as our bedding had quite noticebly been re-arranged and our towels and cups had been put back into its original place. The blonde lady then began pulling beds around and shouting at us that she had not touched my ring. This lady's attitude was as though I had accused her of stealing my ring when this simply was not the case, however after her reaction and rudeness I am beginning to think this was not the case. Once this lady had left my room and me and my partner were alone I was shocked and upset at how she had treated me and how she had spoken to us both, aswell as pulling all of our furniture from the walls in a sort of tantrum. After leaving this hotel i still have not received any explanation or consolation for my ring nor did anyone appear to take any interest in the matter, although this would seem impossible since none of the staff appeared to speak english very well or took any interest in being nice or polite to its guest.

The hotel is HUGE! and Busy!! This is where the Contiki Basement is, and where the passengers get picked up for all Conitki Tours as well as others, so there's always lots of coaches around in the mornings and sometimes at night. Our room was descent. We had 2 beds on opposite sides of the room, I was traveling with my boyfriend so this kind of sucked but we survived. The room was small but that's to be expected in Europe. The Bathroom: The shower sucked! It had lots of pressure, thats for sure. They have a couple bars of soap and 2 towels and thats it... no stealing the shampoo to take home. The lobby was not to terribly busy when we showed up around 3 pm. We got checked in and headed up the tiny elevators to our room. We had a tour booked, and the tour company advised us that we could get the concierge to call them to confirm the pick up time. Well they wouldn't do it because we didn't book the tour through them. They also wouldn't let me use their phone to call them. I found them quite rude as well. There are a couple restaurants around the hotel. One is Blooms Pizza which is in the courtyard.... We ate there for supper one night and had a pizza. It was ok... nothing special. There is also a restaurant right in the hotel which has a buffet supper and this is also where you have your continental breakfast. For breakfast you can have cereal, oranges (cut up segments) or toast, that is cold by the time you get it (its pre toasted) and juice, milk, water, coffee, tea etc. There is also a hot breakfast section which is an additional $4 pounds I belive. It had the basics... It didn't look real great, so we never got it. There were also lots of little restaurants and pubs down the street either way from the hotel. There is a post office just down the street and the Russel Square Tube Station is only a short walk (not even 5 minutes) from the hotel. Right across the street from the Russel Square Tube Station is a Tesco store... Go there and pick up all your snacks and bottled water! We got the 1.5 L bottles of water for $0.35 pence. A great idea if your doing a motor coach tour as normally your first stop isn't for about 2 1/2 hours until you get to Dover. They also have pastries, dougnuts, muffins, salads and tons of snack foods, alcohol etc. All in all, the rooms were clean and we had no major complaints.

The lobby floor, although surfaced in tile to accommodate the throngs of students constantly present, appears never to be cleaned--it is covered in dirt, paper, gum and other materials. The lobby walls are dented, scratched, marked up and covered with dirt. Any woodwork present is discolored by gummed off varnish and filthy. The windows of what appears to be a bizarre little solarium look to have never been cleaned. The entire area is permeated by what can only be described as body odor smell. The elevators are miniscule, accommodating no more than four persons, and are even more filthy than the lobby. They are partially lined by carpeting on the walls, swaths of which are ripped off. The buttons for floors in most (although not all) of the elevators do not light, leaving one to wonder whether you are going to reach the right floor. The elevators are mobbed in the morning and in the evening, causing five minute waits for an elevator with space. The hallways on the floors are uneven and covered with the most filthy carpeting I have ever seen in a hotel. Large pieces of molding in hallway doors have been ripped off, scratches in the wallpaper and walls are everywhere, and where the wallpaper is intact, it has been misfitted to the walls. Where the plaster on the walls has been gouged out, it is simply painted over, leaving on odd, bombed out appearance in places. Except for the carpeting, which appears to have been recently replaced, the rooms are no better. Our beds were covered in a yellow/brown faded bedspread that looks to have been washed thousands of times and to have originated in the 1950s. My bedspread was punctuated by what appeared to be about a four inch square grease spot in the center. The bed mattress is worse--mine was concave, soft, and had one spring that constantly pushed into my back. I did not dare look under the sheets--I suspect that these beds have not been replaced in decades. The built-in furniture seems to not get cleaned--there are bits of grime that appear partially embedded in the finish. The bathrooms have mildew on the ceiling--perhaps because there appears to be no exhaust vent. Our bathtub was punctuated by a large growing rust-spot of about 2 inches square in the corner, appearing like some cancerous dirt virus that you dared not touch. The drapes are of the same faded fabric as the bed. The bed linens, did appear to be clean, but were stiff and scratchy (I guess preferable to the filth otherwise prevalent in the hotel). There was no shampoo or other hygiene products provided in the room--only three very small, and somewhat malodorous, bars of soap. The bath towels were tiny, extremely rough, and some had pronounced grease marks. No hand towels were provided. Based upon the trip-advisor reviews, we brought along two tattered towels that we had previously used to dry our yellow labs--you should know that these towels were far superior to the towels provided by the hotel. To be clear, we find the linens that this hotel uses unsuitable for our dogs, let alone our children. In short, one felt like one needed to wash before, while in, and after departing these rooms. The hotel staff was rude, unhelpful, and disorganized. Upon arriving at the hotel at 12:30, we waited about 45 minutes, only to be told that our rooms were unavailable. We were shuttled into what appears to have been a meeting room commissioned as a luggage holding area. Although we suggested that some of our students might want to change their shoes, they were summarily told by the attendant that they could not open their baggage in this meeting room. The young man who was monitoring the room yelled at one of our students when she reached into her bag, prompting a reply from me. When another student tried to open her bags in the hall, another hotel staff member yelled at her that she could not do so because it created a fire hazard. In short, we were told that, after 14 hours of travel, we could not get into our baggage or into our rooms, and told in a manner that was incredibly rude. At breakfast, in one of three industrial cafeterias the hotel maintains, students were physically barred from the door and shuttled off to other cafeterias when the cafeteria neared capacity. Please know that this was done, as everything is done in this hotel, without a smile and without the use of \"please\" or \"thank you,\" but instead with physical blocking of the doors, outstretched hands, and rude direction. We did elicit one smile--when my wife and I attempted to move our room from the \"courtyard\" (see below), we told the desk attendant that the hotel was a dump. The response was a smile and a statement that \"yes I know.\" The hotel and rooms are so noisy that it is impossible to sleep. There is no air conditioning, and no cross ventilation or room fans, requiring one to leave the window open on warm nights. The hotel has seven floors, with rooms on three busy Bloomsbury streets, and on an interior courtyard. The courtyard is about 100 feet (30 meters) square, with the two lobbies on two sides of the first floor, a bar with picnic tables on a third side, and a pizza shop on the fourth side. Although likely first designed as a garden area, the entire courtyard has been paved over and is used as a staging ground for buses during the day. Buses arrive in sequence all day long and until midnight, belching diesel fumes into the rooms, and offloading tired and loud student groups until late at night. Worse, young people congregate in this \"courtyard,\" and socialize in typical, excessively load voices (some screaming) until late at night--not until after 2:00 A.M. is the courtyard not thronged. In what appears to be a function of the paving and four hard walls that are seven stories high that surround the courtyard, the acoustics force all this noise into the adjoining rooms. The effect is as if one were trying to sleep in a football stadium at the height of a game. Not even with sophisticated noise blocking earphones could I avoid this noise. And strangely, although the windows appear to be double glazed, shutting the windows has virtually no effect (other than to turn the room into a sauna). It is incredibly bad. Students from many of these groups leaned out the windows smoking cigarettes, which in a hotel with inadequate elevators, poorly marked exits, and no room sprinkler systems is nothing short of dangerous and frightening. Young girls in their early teens stayed in the courtyard until late in the morning cavorting with their friends. On one night, a young man in his late teens met us in the hall just as we were returning to our room, asking us to help him find his own room because he was intoxicated. Everything in this hotel is poorly maintained. In one of our rooms, the faucet would not turn off, and attempting to turn it off caused it to run more, eventually overflowing the sink and depositing an inch of water on the bathroom floor. There was no shut-off valve under the sink and our students were forced to miss breakfast, shower in different rooms and eventually move to another room. In our room, the doorknob fell off as we were leaving one night (we placed it in my wife's purse as an extra security measure).", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Happy Aussies", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful, it served it's purpose, we'd come back\u201d", "Author": "Allan-and-Kym", "ReviewID": "UR69838821", "Content": "I knew what to expect from this hotel, as our daughter had stayed here when she did a Contiki Tour of Europe.

The hotel is very large so is popular with coach trips and is always very busy but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t effect us at all. Check in was painless and the staff were all very helpful and pointed us in the correct directions and gave us a few tips on things.

We had a large family room which was very clean and nicely decorated. The beds were very comfortable and we all slept very well, we needed extra towels and tea/coffees which were brought to us within 5 minutes of ringing house keeping. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to breakfast either mornings but you can arrange for a packed breakfast to be brought to your room if required.

Parts of the hotel look like they need upgrading but all in all we had a great time and would definitely use this hotel again. It is a budget city centre hotel but has good facilities and I have stayed in worse travel lodges. Check out was painless and again the staff were lovely.

We're usually the ones looking at all the critical reviews on these sites saying, \"well what did you expect for the price?!\". However in this case even we were a bit disappointed. First thing you should know - the hotel is absolutely huge! I kept getting lost on the way to/from our room. When we arrived we checked in and they gave us a twin room rather than a double. When I explained we wanted a double they said our travel agent didn't specify that a double room was required, but so far as I remember there was nowhere on the booking system she could have done so. I don't generally complain in hotels but their \"why should I care?\" attitude irritated me so eventually, when it was apparent I wasn't backing down, they reassigned us to a double room and pointed us towards the lifts to find our own way through the maze of corridors. The room seemed as clean as you can get a faded and well-used room but it still looked pretty shabby. It was the usual size for a budget hotel room in a big city, so a bit on the small side. The bed was just ok, not massively comfortable and a bit squeaky, and the bedding was quite scratchy. There was a small TV in the corner, 1 chair, a desk and a wardrobe in the room too, so pretty much all the essentials. The bathroom was small but had everything you need and was fairly clean. The window looked out over the courtyard in the middle of the hotel and the other side of the hotel - a bit drab. Not much else to say about it really - just a standard little room. It suited us ok as a place to sleep in between going out and about around London all day but you wouldn't really want to spend much time in there. It actually reminded me of staying in halls at university more than a hotel - it's so big that people are milling about, chatting and shouting until quite late at night. That didn't bother me too much but I know it would annoy some people. There were two good points about the hotel. One was that they let us leave our luggage with them after checkout on our last day so we could go out for the day and then come back to collect them before heading to the airport. There was a bit of a queue for the left luggage room but it was certainly convenient for us. The second is the location. You're a short walk away from an outdoor mall called the Brunswick (highly recommend lunch at Carluccio's if you're feeling a bit plush!), a Tesco Express, coffee shops, caf\u00c3\u00a9s, etc, and a tube station (Russell Square) to connect you to the rest of London (including a direct link to Heathrow airport on the Picadilly line). We also had breakfast in their restaurant on our last morning. The food wasn't the nicest, the restaurant was packed so we had to share a table and there's an odd ticketing system to get hot food that caused a bit of confusion (not just for us, but others in the queue who were sent back to their tables to get a ticket and then rejoin the long queue before they would be given anything to eat). Overall it wasn't the worst hotel we've ever stayed in but it was far from the best. In retrospect I would rather have paid the extra \u00c2\u00a320 or so a night and stayed in one of the more popular chains where you at least get a comfortable, modern room and don't have to go on a 10 mile trek to get in and out.

It was very alarming for the kids. I mentioned to the reception desk on checkout that their policy of assuming that every student was a \"criminal\" and justifying the need for the bond money was unfair, because it was the other guests who were disruptive. The reply was a dismissive \"You should have used common sense madam and called the night porter.\" This was not the response one would expect. What about a polite \"I am sorry about this\". The fact is I would have called reception but I did not know about this incident until the next morning as the kids were cowering in fear. They were too afraid to leave their rooms and certainly too afraid to speak on the phone lest the lout banging on their door could hear them. There was absolutely no idea of customer service at reception. Bathroom was clean but there was rubbish tucked into the seat of the armchair and cigarette burns in bedding.

Service culture is virtually non-existent in the hotel, We had to go to the housekpeeing office and pay a deposit to loan an iron and a hairdryer, and return after use.Breakfast is also a painstaking process. We had to queue half an hour to gain access into the self-help restaurant which falls short of our expectation as far as quality is concerned. No in-room internet . Although free wireless internet is available in the hotel lobby., its standard is just passable. The hotel is conveniently located in central London, just two blocks away from the British Museum. Being in a busy district, it is very noisy with busy traffic all day and all night long. Another downside is the quality of hotel guests. We suffered five sleepless nights as a few groups of Italian and Spanish teenagers (probably on study tours) staying in our neighbouring rooms played games and kept banging their doors throughout the night, causing great disturbance to their neighbours. It is really annoying. Even though we complained, they kept on the disturbance nonetheless. They even put on a hostile look and gave us a finger in the morning. What a bunch of uncivilised hooligans.

The bathrooms are very small - only room for one at a time but there was always plenty of hot water. Again the towels were in need of replacement ours were hard and scratchy and rather grey looking. Breakfast was very canteen buffet stye. No fancy trimmings just rows and rows of bare tables which were constantly cleared and cleaned for the next guests. English breakfast is available at an extra cost. Not the best of ingredients used but there was plenty of it and was topped up regularly. Continental breakfast - dont expect a variety of breads etc. or yoghurt or fresh fruit its just breadbuns, toast and jam - tea coffee and juice.

This station was extremely busy during rush hour, so we often walked to either Kings Cross or Euston to catch the tube. The rooms are basic consisting of 2 single beds (which can be easily converted to a double), wardrobe, tv and bathroom. There was some noise disturbance, which came from workmen and from the kitchens, but this was only audible if the window was open otherwise there was no noise impact. The cooked breakfast was good, despite not going for breakfast till 9-30 there was still plenty of cooked food available and it was still hot. The only negative parts was the large groups that arrived by the coaches and the heating system. The rooms get too hot on a night and we had to open windows to try and keep the rooms cooler. We only used the rooms for sleeping, as we spent most of day walking around London and sightseeing. We only spent a VERY small amount in the hotel. The hotel bar drinks were very watered down, but on the front of the hotel is a pub and the prices were quite reasonable only \u00c2\u00a33 for a pint of lager. So we spent more time there.

We arrived at the hotel at just before midday on the friday, after a short 10-15 min walk from Kings Cross. The reception area was busy with alot of people however lots of these were just simply hanging around waiting for buses etc. I went to the check in desk and waited no more than 4 mins, I handed over my reservation slip, and was given a card for breakfast and 2 room keys and was told I could go to the rom straight away - I was very impressed as previos reviews advised they couldn't check in till 2pm. The room was very large with 2 single beds and a seperate bathroom and toilet room. Yes the rooms were a little dated and could do with a lick of paint for the price we paid I was very impressed. We walked into theatre land as we had booked a show - it was only a 15-20 min walk away. There is a bus stop right outside with very regular buses into the centre and a tube station just a few inute walk. The room was quite noisy on a night as we faced the main road, however what do people expect it is the centre of London so this didn't bother me. We headed for breakfast early at 7.15am as I had read that people had said it was a free for all, we were greeted by firndly staff and found the breakfast very good and plenty to choose from. There is a sign outside the breakfast room clearly advising people that between 8.30 and 9.30 it gets very busy so to make your stay more enjoyable you may want to think about arranging breakfast around this time. We headed back up to our room about 8am after breakfast and a smoke to find the maids already hard at work, we had clean towels, our beds were made and got more tea and coffee satchets.

We arrived from a very long flight from Australia at around 9 in the morning and came from the airport on the tube. Very easy trip to Russell Square and hotel only a short walk from the tube station. We didn't expect to check in and were told by the uninterested staff that we couldn't check in until the Contiki basement (beside the hotel) was open at 11. Fair enough, we just asked could we leave our bags in storage and were directed to the other desk. We were yelled at by another staff member who said he was tired of young girls leaving their bags and not coming back , he then took us to leave our bags and gave us a dirty look. I do have to wonder why would anyone just leave their bags and not come back but anyway. We went off to explore London. We came back about midday and went to the Contiki basement, got our documents and went back to try and check in. Wouldn't let us again, we had to wait till 2. Ok thats understandable thats when checkin time was but was a little frustrating to have to go out again when we were so jetlagged and tired but off we went to see some more of London. Finally come back at 4 and are allowed to check in. As mentioned in other reviews staff were rude, didn't seem to care and some had some issues speaking english. For this room we were on the 2nd floor and directed to the bank of lifts near reception. We didn't realise how huge this hotel is! Our room ended up being on the second floor in the building opposite reception. We got lost trying to find the room, so many different corridors but finally found the room. The doorknob was falling off the door but the card worked and we got in the room. It was tiny. 2 single beds, tv didn't work, stains all over the carpet, ugh it was bad. It didn't get better in the bathroom, mould everywhere, shower flooded. My friend and I just had to laugh, it was only for one night and we were about to do a contiki tour and felt for sure that there were going to be worse hotels. We stayed again after the tour. This time we were in a different room on the 6th floor. It was much better, no stains, no mould but again only staying for one night so wasn't to fussed. Ultimately I would not stay here again. The only reason we stayed here was because of the tour and if I was to do another tour I would stay at another hotel nearby. The location to russell square tube station was really good.

I was sure all the negative comments would be unjustified and first impressions proved positive. Yes there were lots and lots or people from all nationalities milling around and there was a chaotic edge to it, a bit like an airport, but when we got there at lunchtime we were able to check our bags into left luggage quite quickly. We returned at 5pm and there was no queue to check in so again, nothing painless there. Our room took some finding as the place is absolutely huge. The room itself was a good size, pretty functional but was expecting nothing else. Staying positive, the breakfast was nice and there was plenty of it - a full English included in our deal but the foreigeners had to pay for it, which was great as it meant that the queue for the hot food was tiny. Finding a table wasn't too bad but be prepared to sit side by side with strangers, just like in a packed school hall or works canteen. Back to the room... and the negatives. Unfortunately the window, when shut, provided little insulation from the noise outside. I'd even shut the air vent at the top but it made no difference. We overlooked the main courtyard, where there were non-stop comings and goings and it did echo a lot which meant you could hear a lot of noise. On top of this, the hotel hires out conference rooms on the evening and on the Saturday night there was a lot of rowdiness due to a party on the ground floor which went on well into the early hours of the morning. All of those I suppose I could live with but there were other problems which spoilt it for me. The TV didn't work at all which was a shame. But, the biggest thing for me was the electrics. I'm guessing the TV itself was ok but the socket was broken. I was unable to swap it with the only other socket in the room as the plug just wouldnt fit in for some reason. The other socket worked ok at first as we plugged our hairdryer into it but on the last day the socket was dead. Didn't work at all, so it meant we were left with wet hair and no charge in my phone. It's therefore impossible to recommend this place, unless you aren't bothered about making use of an electric socket and in this day and age, who of us aren't? Oh, and there was also the issue of theft. I left a handful of change on the table as I didn't want it weighing my pocket down on the second day but the cleaner obviously helped herself to it. Granted I shouldn't have left it out, but really she had no right to see it as a tip! So... unfortunately all those people who said this place is nothing more than a hostel were right.

Russel Square is only 2 mins away and is a great place to sit and have lunch - the weather during our stay was exceptional. We got back to the hotel at 7pm, check in took 5 mins. We were a bit annoyed as we were told that we HAD to pay for the kids breakfast there and then (the adults were covered in the deal). After reading the reviews we had decided not to eat breakfast at the hotel. We explained this only to be told that we had to pay even if we were not taking breakfast. Having said that I'm glad we did because breakfast was fine. Our room was small and basic but fine. The 4th bed was a zed bed but our 11 year old said it was comortable. The other beds were a bit soft but acceptable and the linen was clean. The room was clean - the decor was very tired but for us the room was for sleeping at night and no more. There is a lot of noise from the road. We were woken up by sirens a couple of times during the night but after all this is central London. The shower was fab. The batchroom again looked tired but it was clean. We ventured down for breakfast - having paid we thought we'd risk one day. The breakfast room is packed and you have to grab a table when it becomes available. We had cooked breakfast included but the queues were massive. However, juice, cereal, toast and coffee was easy to get so we made do with that and it was fine. On the 2nd morning I did get the cooked breakfast. To be honest it wasn't great (average at best although surprisingly the eggs were perfectly cooked, bacon was unevenly cooked) and I think sticking with continental is better. The central location of this hotel and it's proximity to Russel Square tube means it's perfect for a sightseeing break. We had no problems with noise from other guests and genuinely enjoyed our stay here. We had 3 nights. On the 1st night we had a complimentary meal at one of the restaurants. Ours kids wanted curry so we went to Poppadom Express. The decor is excellent and the food was good. The deal meant we had the buffet. Starters were good and the main courses more than satisfactory. The salad bar was good too. Our kids ate loads and loved the food. I've eaten better curries but I've also been served much worse. This got us of to a good start. This hotel isn't perfect.

About the hotel itself: It's just a decent building without any eccessive decorations or details. It's prefect for tourists or large groups, since you don't have to let the reception know when you leave or enter your room. Literally. we saw the reception when we checked in and out, which was quite fast, without waiting. Rooms are small but big enough to feel comfortable, not like in prison.

Our reservation included only continental breakfast, which consists of toast, jam, cereals and fruit, but there is English breakfast which you can buy at the price of 4.50 pounds, which is quite tasty. The only thing that bothered us was that we were there at the same with a kids' excursion, so we had to wait for about 15-20 minutes to get to the dining room. It was only on the fourth morning the manager realised the waiting line was too long, so a bigger dining room was opened. Not to forget to mention, sheets and towels are changed each second day, so you don't have to take your own towels, as I did, trusting the reviews saying there are no towels at all!

Our room looked out onto a quadrangle of other rooms and therefore, it was necessary to keep the curtains closed to avoid others seeing in. The bathroom toiletries consisted of small bars of 'soap' only and the towels (only 3 in total) were very old and well used. However, my greatest disappointment was in the buffet breakfast. It was in a very large room resembling a campus canteen. It was VERY busy and tables were at a premium. Self service was the order of the day and the continental breakfast was very sparse. Two fruit juices, four cereals, toast (not freshly cooked), a brown or white roll and tinned fruit were all that you had to select from. No hams, cheeses or selection of breads. There was only tea or coffee to wash it down, no fruit or herbal teas. If you did want to partake of a cooked breakfast, it would cost you a supplement of \u00c2\u00a34.50 per person at the servery.

We therefore had a much quieter aspect than feared albeit we had normal traffic noise as you would expect in the middle of London. It is the central courtyard area onto which a lot of the rooms face which is noisy - as it fronts both entrances, a bar, restaurant and, of course, all the taxis and revellers who come in later on. Whilst there were certainly a fair few groups of travellers we saw no real groups of school children or teenagers - infact the hotel bars and restaurants were fairly quiet. We had a cooked breakfast included and ate this at a slightly different location than most across the courtyard. The breakfast was fine for the money albeit pretty busy.

The room was BASIC - but it was CLEAN - even the bathroom. Please, please do not expect anything other than blank walls and basic rooms - but perfectly adequate. The hotel needs money spending on it - but thats why its currently cheap! The small asian restaurant attached was excellent! The British Museum is a ten minute walk away - great! The only quirk was that the reception staff physically stand and do absolutely nothing until the clock hits 2.00 before you can check in - amazing but true - then its a rush to get to them first! (to be fair I think this is because they are so incredibly efficient afterwards with all the paperwork etc.) Do go - but this is BASIC in terms of rooms.

On our first full day I had to complain about the noise, teenagers shouting out of their room window's to one another across the inner quadrangle. First morning breakfast a total nightmare no tray's massive queues and seating taken. Staff went complained to just treat you like you where not there. English breakfst cold apart from warm sausage, toast still white, disgusting tea and coffee. We did not venture in again until the last day,it was truly awful. Like Butlins in the 50's as seen on T.V. we only went in because we were too tired to go elsewhere The room was dirty and dusty, floors had not been vaccumed properly and stains on carpets. We had 68 South American teenage girls arrive on our floor the second last day of our Hol's and the noise when they arrived was horrendous. But it only got worse, they went out their first night and came back at 2.00am banging doors and shouting, running up and down corridors. They decided to party in the room right opposite ours and they continued to bang on the door, I told them to be quiet and they apologised. Ten minutes later it started again. I phoned the concierge and he sent a guy up, I pointed out the door and he knocked \"he told them to be quiet and left, about 15 minutes later he was back as they had started again. He told them there had been more complaints and they said sorry and he left, but he had to come back again and this was about 3.30am, the noise stopped apart from the banging of their doors. It was about 4.30am 0r 5.30am by the time we got back to sleep. So the next morning we complained and the manager came to see us and gave us a compaints form to fill in. I aske where the Chapperones for these teenagers where and he said on the other side of the Hotel, well away from the noise. I asked if we could keep our room on to catch up on our sleep and he said the hotel was fully booked. He then said it would be \u00c2\u00a346 and we could stay till 5.00pm, so fully booked ! then he changed his mind. So I asked him if this was his good will gesture for us being kept awake, He said it would stil be \u00c2\u00a346, So I have no choice as my wife was shattered. When we looked at the complaint form it asked what we thought of the room and was it clean. So we told the truth and said it was not and listed the reason's. We went back to our room after the staff had finished on our floor making bed's. This was about 1.00pm and we lay on the bed's and dosed off only to be awoken by loud banging on the door. I answered and it was the Rusian head housekeeper and she is shouting at me \"You compalin, You complain about dirty room, You show me stains on carpet and dirty walls. She shout's I have had head man on phone to me and he is not happy. So I bring her in the room and show her, She is not happy and is more annoyed that I have proved my point. She has with her an Indian lady, who I can only assume is the one who is supposed to clean the room. So I ask them to leave as we are trying to catch up on our sleep and she does and gives me a filthy look as she goes. We eventually doze off again and around 2.30pm or so we are awoken again by banging on the door and I answer it is an African woman and she has the Indian lady with her. She is shouting at me you have complained and I want too see room . I tell her the Russian Housekeeper has already been and has seen the room, she is still shouting at me so I tell her to go away and come back when we have gone. Just then out of the corner of My eye I notice the Russian Housekeeper she is standing watching what is going on and on seeing I have noticed her she steps back, trying to hide. How pathetic she has deliberatley brought this African woman to wake us up, there was no other reason as she had already been and saw the room. Childish and pathetic So this is how the staff at this Hotel / hostel treat people who complain. I recieved a snotty and kurt letter of the hotel Managment and it said it was a one off what had happened and I told her to look at your website to see it was not. I recieved a letter from Superbreak who we booked this trip with and that more or less said the same and took the side of the staff and they sent me a voucher for \u00c2\u00a320 if I want to book another trip. They have more chance of winning the Lottery than getting me to book another trip or staying in that Hotel/Hostel.

First of all, through my travel agent, I booked to stay two nights before my tour. After I had confirmed and paid, however, my flight changed and instead of arriving at 2pm on the Sunday I was to arrive at 6am. As I'd already paid for the two nights my agent let the hotel know that I would be arriving at approximately 7am on the Monday and would like to go to my room at that time [hey, I'd paid for night - I had a right to use it. When I got there, after 23 hours of flying, not to mention customs, stopovers and an hour on the tube, I arrived, pulled out my voucher book and was rudely told that to go to the contiki basement - which opens at nine. So after lugging my case and backpack down those horrible narrow stairs and waiting in the freezing cold until 9am, I was told by contiki staff that I had to check0in upstairs [no complaints about the staff - it wasn't their fault I was sent to them. So back up to the hotel counter, where once again, the staff were rude, telling me that check-in was not until 2pm. I had to explain multiple times, to a number of different people about my situation - all the while trying to be polite when I was jet-lagged, had a headache and had already waiting 2 hours after they fobbed me off the first time. Not even showing them my vouchers proving I'd paid for two nights worked. Eventually a manager of sorts let me check in. I was then sent to the concierge desk across the foyer to collect my key [card]. Again I had to argue about my check-in time, the man told me I couldn't have my key until 2pm. Eventually though, I got my key. When I asked how to get to my room, the concierge rudely waved in a direction, which I later found out was the complete opposite of where my room was. No proper direction to the lift etc. Boy those rooms are hard to find - the room numbers don't go in a sensible order. Finally, I get to my room which already has someone in it - I get that I paid for a twin room and that I might be sharing with someone at some stage - but not once did any of the check in staff inform me that there was indeed someone in the room already. The room was ok for just sleeping in, but not a place I would want to spend time in. All in all I know that this is a convenient place to stay for contiki people, but at 70 pounds/night it is absolutely not worth it. I would never stay there again, nor would I recommend it to any of my friends.

There is also a paid parking garage next to the hotel. The hotel is enormous, with many many tour groups (including many European adolescents on holiday). Check in took a while.

It felt a bit like a canteen in there as there were a lot of long tables seating about 10 people but i suppose this is for the coach tours / scool kids that are staying there. There were smaller tables so this wasn't a problem. My only gripe is that we had to pay (50 pence per case) to leave our case with concierge on the day we were leaving surly that isn't on as we didn't have to pay the day we arrived.

The rooms themselves are very basic, small beds, frayed bed-linen, scratchy towels. The walls of rooms are without any sound-proofing (honestly someone next door to you coughs and you will know about it). One good point - I had plenty of hot water in the morning for the shower, and they are clean enough I guess. The staff don't give a damn and will make sure that you know this - avoid all contact with them. The worst part of this hotel is that it is part of a chain - Imperial Hotels I think - all of the sister hotels are within a couple of blocks of the Royal National. All of these sister hotels are just as basic, but don't seem to suffer from being full of students/kids so if you REALLY REALLY want to find out how bad a hotel that costs this much in London can be then for heavens sake book into The President - same low rate, same location but I stayed there a couple of times and it was nowhere near as bad. I also stayed at The Tavistock once and it it was OK. So honestly do not stay at this hotel, if you want something this cheap in what is admittedly a good location then go with one of the other Imperial Hotels - they are just as bad but you have a small chance of being able to sleep.

We got directions from the bell desk which sounded simple but we quickly learned that it was a long and confusing walk. That was the first and last time that we walked. There are always taxi's outside of the hotel. The food in the hotel at the Pavillion Restaurant was awful. It's called a buffet style restaurant but it is not all you can eat. I had the roast chicken and potatoes, the potatoes were hard, probably from just sitting in the buffet area, as the restaurant was not busy and the chicken had absolutely no taste. That was first and last time we ate there. There wasn't really much in the area, as far as restaurants. There are a few places but if you have someone picky with you, as I did, it will be difficult to eat at or around the hotel. Phone calls from the room were at a pretty good rate, not expensive at all. We purchased tour bus tickets right at the hotel and the bus picks up right outside of the hotel, this was a plus but you do have to find your own way back to the hotel as the bus does not bring you back. The day of check-out we decided to do some last minute shopping before our flight and used the baggage hold service at the hotel. They charged 50pence per bag, which I didn't mind but it was the first time a hotel charged me for holding luggage. All in all, If i was travelling to London on a tight budget I would stay here again, otherwise I would definitely find somewhere else.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "wigan", "Title": "\u201cWell placed hotel - good access to places of interest (just a short 20m walk)\u201d", "Author": "doodles7", "ReviewID": "UR28161083", "Content": "I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel with my husband and 10yr old daughter.

This is the worst hotel I have been yet. For me, my wife and child, it was a nightmare. The night before the trip, my six year old daugther suffered an asthma crisis. But she was better in the morning, so we decided to go to London anyway, with all the medical drugs she needs. After all, London is a european capital, with medical services available. If we didn't go, we'd lose all the money we had invested in the seven day trip. And so we went. She was ok, but the three of us were very tired, because we almost hadn't slept the night before, because of her asthma crisis. We arrived at the hotel - big, noisy and horrible - and went to our room, just to find out it had all the ingredients for another asthma crisis. There was a huge stain in the ceiling, resulting from water infiltration from the floor above, humidity on the walls and the paint was falling off. The room heater was completely full of dust. The small bed they had reserved for my daughter looked something out of the times of industrial revolution, more fit to acommodate child workers after a 16 hour day shift at the factories. I tried to change rooms, using diplomacy at first, then protesting veemently. They didn't give a damn. I noticed everybody, from the bar to the reception, seemed to abhorr guests, and didn't care the least bit for them. They alleged they had no more rooms. A housekeeper went to our room, to \"clean up\"... But there was nothing to clean up, a complete maintenance was needed, not just removing some dust... The poor woman looked at that room in disbelief, exclaimed: \"Stupid reception! How can they insist in giving and asthmatic child this room\", and proceeded to show us a diferent wing of the hotel, with better rooms. She said: \"they have rooms available, yes, ask for a room in the seventh or sixth floor, insist you want another room\". We went downstairs again... They kept refusing, and this time I lost my temper a bit, telling them to fix this, wathever the cost. I even said I would be willing to pay more for a better room. They kept on refusing. I called my travel agent, they called them, and they put us for one night only at the Tavistock Hotel, nothing special, but much better, with clean rooms and friendly personnel. On the next day, my agent called me, saying they would give me a better room at the Royal National. Like stupid, we went there again, but they wanted to send us again to the same room... Unbelievable. So I went to the Holiday Inn Bloomsbury, payed another 400 euros and stayed very confortably installed during the rest of my stay in London. The Holiday Inn Bloomsbury, just around the corner from the Royal National, is a small and good hotel, rooms very clean, and all the personnel very professional, kind and helpful. Breakfast is great. This is a good hotel to stay in the area. The Royal National?

It was a good deal. I read reviews on tripadvisor.com after staying there, and I have to say what I read on line is quite accurate. Good location: The hotel is within five minutes walking distance from the Russell Square tube station. British Museum is about ten minutes away. There are many restaurants, sandwich stores and little grocery stores nearby. We got drinking water from the Tesco store across street from the tube station, 0.36p per 2 liter bottle. There are many kinds of sandwiches for sale as well, with prices as low as \u00c2\u00a31 (ranging from \u00c2\u00a31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a32.8). There is a Pret a Manger store next to the Tesco store, where you can get sandwiches too. Continental breakfast: It is not bad considering the fact it was free. It has toast, butter, jams, apple and orange juice, milk, and four kinds of cereal. You do need to be there early in order to get a seat. We were not given directions by the front desk for where the breakfast is served. We asked around and were directed to the line where the English breakfast was served. The lady took a look at our voucher and told us to pay \u00c2\u00a34.5 per person. I said I thought the breakfast is free; she gave me this nasty look and pointed me to the line where continental breakfast is served. So make sure you are in the right place if you are not prepared to pay extra. There is a little bar across the street also serves English breakfast but for a lower price. You may check that out. Room and service: We got a room with a double bed and two twin beds. It was comfortable and clean. They supplied a water boiler with cups, tea bags, coffee packets, creamer, and sugar. The hotel also supplied small soap bars and towels, but no shampoo so we called housekeeping to send some. Within about 5 minutes they showed up with plenty of shampoo but no conditioner. There was a small TV in the corner, but no clock. Since our room faced towards the street we got a lot of noise from the window. The room was too warm, so we have to leave the window open for the night, and the noise became very irritating. Also, it seems that there might be an emergency response center nearby, so we were constantly listening to the sounds of sirens at night. Also, we could hear the sounds of teenagers in the hallways and outside the window.

Tried out the shower in the bathroom, which was quite powerful and very nice, if not a little tempermental with the temperature. We had a triple room, which had a Z-bed pushed up against the wall at the bottom of the two twin beds, thereby blocking the trouser press (not that we needed it) and creating little space in the room. The Z-bed also had a problem with temperature. I could not get to sleep as I was freezing from the waist up. This was with four (provided) duvets on. Window opened nice and wide, although others reported different window fittings that had not worked so well. No double glazing either. Didn't use much of the TV. Tea/coffee making facilities were pretty basic, but did the job. Didn't really understand the locking system on the inside of the doors, and there was no peephole, which meant opening the doors and sticking your head out. Slow closing fire doors which you'd hear slamming in the middle of the night. DO NOT USE THE ELEVATORS. These are even more tempermental than the showers and tend to drop from higher floors occasionally. I ended up taking the stairs for the rest of the trip (it didn't help that we were on the top floor neither). Breakfast was poorly made and consisted of either apple juice/orange juice/water and toast/cereal. Something like a \u00c2\u00a34.50 supplement charge was implemented for the cooked breakfast. Toast was underdone, cold and very chewy. Milk included with the cereal tasted off. There was always huge crowds in the lobby, usually waiting for the reception desk or a tour bus. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel at all.

It had two small single beds which didn't look very accommodating. The room is very very basic, the bathroom is very small but does the trick, and there's a little storage space. The main problem with this room was that the window would close properly (and I was overlooking the main road). I couldn't sleep for the noise of the traffic (I'm used to London noise, but this was ridiculous). My main problem was that this hotel is seriously dated and only just does the job.

We had read all the reviews so we were a bit anxious about staying at this hotel. Our expectations weren't too high after reading some of the reiviews! We were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is in a wonderful location near the University of London and the British Museum. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Oxford street and about an hour walk to the tower of London, buckingham palace etc. We did a lot of walking but we also bought an oyster card for the subway and buses - an oyster card is definitely the cheapest and easiest way to travel in London. We took the train from Gatwick to King's cross and found it an easy 10 minute walk pulling our suitcases to the hotel. The area felt very safe and Russel tube station is only a few minutes from the hotel. There are stores, restaurants etc. within a few minutes walk of the hotel. The hotel is very big and definitely basic but our room was clean and quiet.(I would compare it to a motel room in North America - basic but adequate) The bed was clean and comfortable, the window was able to open wide, which was nice. There was a TV which we didn't use but seemed to work fine. The bathroom was clean and the water pressure in the tub/shower was great. The hotel room was a decent size. All the people we met who worked at the hotel were friendly and helpful - no complaints. The hotel is very big and next time we would prefer a smaller hotel. The halls are long and very basic and needing some paint in places, but how much time do you spend in a hallway. The continental breakfast was fine - nothing special, but it wasn't bad either. A bit boring because the same thing was out everyday - toast and buns with variety of jams/jellies, 4 kinds of cereal, including Mueseli, orange and grapefruit segments, apple and orange juice, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. It was fine. For an extra 4 pounds you could get the full breakfast, but it didn't look too exciting! It was busy at the hotel while we were there, but not so busy that we ever had to wait for anything. The hotel felt safe and the people staying at it seemed to be mostly tourists from all over the world - all ages. If you have high expectations for a fancy hotel or if you plan to spend a lot of time in your room, don't go to this hotel.

This was our first trip to London, and we really appreciated the fact that we were close to the tube station, and to the British museum, which was fascinating. The breakfasts were adequate, and one day we did treat ourselves to a hot breakfast which was delicious. The room that we were allocated was not spotless, and the beds and furniture were very old and dilapidated. The lady who cleaned our room was consistently rude and offhand when we did bump into her, berating us on the last day because we had not cleared the room in time, despite us having made arrangements with management for a late departure time (our flight was only leaving late in the evening). But the absolutely worst thing was that I found a bed bug in my bed. At the time I did not know what it was - I had woken up in the early hours of the morning, only to discover this tiny reddish-brown bug in the bed that looked similar to a small tick. As I had taken a spare blanket out of the cupboard during the night, I assumed that perhaps the tick had come from the blanket. I picked it up with a tissue and flushed it. That was my biggest mistake. Over the next couple of days I was bitten every single night. I began getting suspicious that it was bedbugs, but not wanting to ruin the family sightseeing holiday, I stuck it out. As soon as we were on our way home, I checked up bedbugs on the Internet, and to my horror discovered that this is what had been in my bed - I even had the telltale \"breakfast, lunch and dinner\" bite marks described in the article. Well, what a nightmare. We had to leave all out luggage in the garage, wash all our clothes in hot water, spray insecticide over the luggage, and place what we could not wash into a hot dryer. My advice to anyone going to this hotel is to check the mattress when you get there, and if you have any suspicion of bugs - report it to management immediately, preferably with the evidence in hand, and insist on a room change. Because of the very high volume of guests going through this hotel, I am sure that they do experience problems of this nature from time to time.

Last year January 2008 as we were waiting for our coach to come to take us to the airport we saw workers removing all the rerstaurant furniture. We were told they were going to refurbish it. This was the biggest mistake.... So our first Continental breakfast was as usual. In other countries you also get cheese, ham, hard boild egg. The restaurant was very cold. We had to leave our jackets on while eating. After 4 days I got fed up of the breakfast and opted to buy a breakfast. The choice was ok but after being served and paying for the meal and getting to your table the food was cold. Cold fried eggs just don't go down to well. The dinners were no different. The meats were not cooked well, the potatoes were hard in the centre, the veggies given to you were enough to be counted and again cold. As we were in a group we could only stand having two meals. Also I must say that unlike the year before the restaurant had very few diners. Last time they had to open another room for diners. But the heat was not in the kitchen, oh no, it was behind the serving counters were the staff and kitchen manager were going at it like cat and dog. The shouting and of course as they were Indian and Chinese we didn't know what they were saying but this behaviour should not be allowed in the restaurant. To end all this we were really disgusted with the restaurant. For the same price we had better meals in other restaurants where the place was warm and the food was hot and the service was good.

Location: Excellent - very short distance from Russell Square tube station and a block and a half from the British Museum. Lots of excellent restaurants very nearby as well as an internet cafe, small markets, pubs, and a shopping mall. Rooms: Good - very clean, small (but that's all over London so I wasn't surprised). We booked rooms with two twin beds - a bit cramped but nothing we couldn't handle. In suite bath - shower and tub. Hot water all the time - and that's something you don't always find in Europe. Bring your own washcloths, though - they don't come with the towels! Maid service is timely and thorough. We did have a problem with the toilet seat in my room (it came unhinged) - called maintenance and it was fixed in a jiffy. We had a TV set that wasn't programmed correctly but it worked and we didn't go to London to watch TV so that wasn't a problem for us. Breakfast: Rate includes a continental breakfast served from 7-10 am (cereals, toast, bagels, jam, coffee, milk, hot chocolate, juices). If you want a more substantial breakfast, just add the supplement (two kinds of eggs, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, tomatoes, beans) for 4.50 pounds. Most of the people in my group ate the continental breakfast and were fine. Service: Check-in was smooth - all the room keys and bedroom cards were ready for us. Be prepared to fill out an information card with passport number, home address, etc. Concierge desk was helpful and ready to answer questions - can book tours, special excursions, and get theater tickets. Some of the staff aren't as helpful as others but you'll find that everywhere.

Even with the hustle and bustle, we found the rooms to be quiet enough - our only \"loud\" evening was New Year's Eve and even that quieted down after midnight.

I've stayed in more comfortable, more \"luxurious\" hotels in Europe but the Royal National is just fine ... we wanted to save money on the lodging so we could spend it in other ways.

Fine I thought, this was London and knowing that accommodation here in the centre could be very pricey, I succumbed to it as long as it was clean. How wrong I was! The room could not have been refurbished since the hotel was first built. The fitted carpet reeked of a decomposed carcass (I actually looked around and under the beds to see if there was one!), the furniture must have been collected from some scrap heap somewhere and the bed had hair strands in it. I really am not one to complain so I just kept my mouth shut and listened to my partner on the other end of the phone who told me it was just for a couple of days. The wardrobe did not have hangers in it so I caught sight of one of the receptionists on duty on my floor and asked him to bring me some. When I returned from dinner, the hangers were not there. I reported it to the receptionists again in the morning on waking up and nothing was brought over so I asked them again before going to work. After a very long day at 7:30pm, the hangers were still not in the room so I called the Housekeeping Department who were there with the hangers within 5mins. The following morning, knowing that nothing was done from any requests handed over to the useless receptionists or from the concierge on duty, I spoke to one of the maids on the floor to give the room a thorough vacuum. She just fobbed me off with an OK as nothing ever happened again. There were still strands of hair on the floor. The tea/coffee condiments were never replenished until my last day, there was mould visible on the bathroom ceiling and all the linen and towels were replaced everyday even though I told them there was no need to (I was there for three days only so didn't feel the need - this hotel follows no rules to eco-tourism). Breakfast left much to be desired and none of the staff ever showed one single smile.

Disappearing items, lack of power sockets, and slidey beds awaited me... The shiny lobby is the first bit you see, but don't be fooled as we were by thinking that the rest of the hotel is the same quality as this. Once we got checked into our rooms we found there was one plug socket between two of us, and a tiny kettle, as if we would never need to charge our phones or anything. For my male friends in rooms of 3, they had an extra campbed put in the room, low down, definitely nowhere near the standard of a proper bed, leaving hardly any room to move in the bedroom, and there was STILL only one plug socket! The friend I was sharing with and I went down to reception to ask if we could hire a 'four gang' converter to make 4 sockets, and we were told to go to housekeeping by someone on the desk who had a very rude and unhelpful attitude. They didn't have any, so we had to go out and buy one. Other problems included the beds being on huge wheels meaning you couldn't even sit up in bed to read without it sliding away under you, the bedclothes consisting of a sheet, cover-thing, and an extremely scratchy blanket, the type you'd expect to find on a bed in an emergency camp. The beds themselves were comfy enough, but I would have really appreciated a decent duvet. The shower in the bathroom was a fixed mixer tap one, and while the bathroom was perfectly clean enough, it would be nice to have a handheld-able shower. The free wifi was nice - but whenever I tried to look at my e-mails in Internet Explorer, my AVG anti-virus told me I was getting trojans from it. AVG dealt with them but I used Firefox as I usually do, and it was ok. Be careful if you use Internet Explorer! The breakfast was very disappointing, poor quality food, the bread especially (I actually thought a roll was plastic when I picked it up - I kid you not), the 'toast' was lukewarm bread which was cold when you'd reached your table, and a hot breakfast (bacon, eggs etc) was \u00c2\u00a34.50 extra and I didn't go for it - it didn't look at all appetising. The only bearable thing was the grapefruit. The major problem I encountered was the mysterious disappearance of my hoodie and of another girl's camera while we were out on the second day. I had left some clothes on my bed, and I came back to find my night-clothes flung on a chair and my hoodie (which had sentimental value too) absolutely nowhere. The girl on my trip had left her digital camera in her drawer and when she got back after our day's excursion it had gone. No-one else but her friend and themaids had access to the room. I went to housekeeping to ask about my hoodie - the foreign workers didn't get what I was asking about at first - and then said it could have been taken for laundry. I was very cross as I had not asked for laundry to be done at all. By Friday (it disappeared on Tuesday) it had still not been found. I left my address and am just hoping it turns up after being accidentally caught up in the bedding. If not... Please, if you're looking for somewhere, look at somewhere other than here! I can't believe the company college used chose to waste my money (a considerable amount) on this level of accommodation. Extremely disappointed and angry at the loss of a valued hoodie.

I think that it all depends on the way that they are treated. We were very friendly with them and treated them with respect and courtesy which was was returned. However we witnessed other people being quite curt and unfriendly with the staff and the staff were understandably less friendly with them. We can't fault the food. We had our free meal in the Pavilion and it was superb. First course: Soup (Minesterone...it was okay as soups go) Second Course: Roast beef (I got huge slabs of tender lovely meat) and my friend got Roast chicken, which again was a huge portion...half a chicken with moist juicy meat). The vegetables were delicious (not too hard and not too soft) as was the lovely gravy. Third course: Black Forest Gateau and Carrot cake. Nice and moist. Very good. Our breakfast was also very good and the lady who served us was very generous with the bacon. We arrived about 7:00am each morning and it was nice and quiet with no queues. Our bedroom was overlooking the main courtyard where the coaches arrived at all hours and the people getting on and off the coaches were very noisy. I would have preferred to have had a room overlooking the main road instead which would have been considerably quieter. However there was little or no noise in the hotel itself. Better double glazing would have helped with the noise problem. Also the rooms really could do with a lick of paint and some better furniture. We decided to keep our clothes in the case rather than put them in the drawers and wardrobe which were rather shabby.

I didn't really know what to expect at all, as I hadn't heard anything either way, and all I wanted was a clean, comfortable room and a bed to sleep in the night before my tour. I would have to say that it was very handy for location (so near to the Tube, only a few minutes walk), for the Contiki basement (where they helped you organise everything for your tour), and for the nearness to everything in London (the tour buses parked literally right outside the hotel, and there were so many restaurants nearby, plus the British Museum is only around the corner!) I didn't have to do anything at the lobby because practically everything was organised by the Basement, so it was like an entire separate hotel- but I really wish they had a lift leading down to it, because trying to drag your suitcase up and down those steep stone steps was a killer- I literally nearly fell down them! I thought it was confusing having a lobby on both sides of the courtyard- I never knew which side to go into, which was especially confusing the first time when I wasn't used to the hotel and had to collect my key! Apart from that, everything in the hotel was really convienient- there were shops, including a gift shop, in the hotel itself, and a restaurant, which was very handy when you hadn't much time to wander around looking for shops and restaurants. The corridors were dark and gloomy, and extremely long, but once I was inside my room I thought it was really nice- I didn't find them cramped or gloomy or dirty at all. I thought they were spacious and bright, and I liked the way they had the beds at opposite sides and ends of the room, so it felt like you had more space. I also liked the extra table, the TV and the coffee and tea maker- it was one of the only hotels I stayed in that had one of these! The bathroom was small but clean, and nice enough, and the shower I got was up very high- and I knew what people meant about the water pressure!- but there were no actual problems. I didn't have any problems checking in, and although I'd booked a twin room for less expense, they didn't put anyone sharing with me that first night- it didn't make any difference, I just thought it was strange. The last night, after my trip, there was a girl sharing the room with me, and she told me that although she'd requested to share with her friend, they'd put them in different rooms, which I thought was bad of them, even though it didn't affect me. The key cards were a bit awkward- I found it very hard to open the door with them- but maybe it was just me, not being able to get the hang of them. I didn't find it noisy at night at all- I found it very peaceful- but I'm sure the next morning it was, when all the Contiki travellers were gathered in the courtyard laughing and roaring like they were still drunk! But I was out with them anyway- I pity anyone trying to have a lie-on! I was worried about sleeping it out and missing the coach, as I'd have to make my own way, but the reception staff kept their promise about giving me a wake-up call, so I couldn't fault them on that. For all the people complaining how it was noisy, I think they should be aware that it is a Contiki hotel, and that hordes of young people will be staying there, especially during the summer. It's not a place to go to if you want peace and quiet! The only real complaint I have about the Royal National was the way I was treated by one of the staff on my last day. It was after my tour had finished and I was staying the one extra night- I didn't actually realise I had to check out by a certain time in the morning, and when I found my room locked, and panicked that I'd be late for my flight, I was verbally attacked by the woman behind the counter, who ranted about how they needed my room and that 'ignorance was no excuse.' I can well understand that it was my own fault, I couldn't blame them for me forgetting, but it was the way that woman spoke to me. Whatever happened to being polite to your guests, and not directly blaming them for anything? She was speaking to me like I was a naughty schoolgirl, and that scolding attitude put me off the Royal National a bit. I know it's a year ago now, but I thought speaking to their guests that way was a bit uncalled-for, especially when it was a genuine mistake. Other than that, I found nothing to be wrong at the Royal National, although I can see why other people mightn't be so keen,with the smallness and the crowds.

I certainly agree with the previous reviewer who said youth hostels were a better option. I have stayed at two-star hotels in rural Peru that were decidedly better. After flying all night we showed up at the Royal National in the morning and were told to return at 3:00 pm to check in. Anticipating that many others would also be checking in, we decided to give them an extra hour and returned at 4:00 pm to find 5 lines of people attempting to check in, with more than 20 families or groups in each line. The harrowing check-in took well over an hour (with staff readily and vocally agreeing with furous people who shouted in various languages that this was the worst service they had experienced at any hotel in the world). In the end we were given a room that was the opposite of what was described, e.g., they took great pains to tell us how lucky we were to be getting a double bed (in accordance with our request) but in fact gave us a room with twin beds. The room was akin to a substandard student dormatory. But by the time you get the room you just give up and accept whatever it is. The staff is young and untrained and try to be helpful but the systems and management of the hotel are so unbelievably bad that they can do nothing. The breakfast is pretty awful. The room phones to call the front desk do not work. Then if you go to front desk you are in for a 20 minute wait, behind many others who also have justifiable complaints. Your choice is to accept the place or to spend your days in London waiting futilely to complain to hotel management. All in all, staying at the Royal National is a memorably bad experience.

We then proceeded to the self service restaurant. There was 8+ waiting staff standing around none of which offered any help or showed us what the procedure was. We went over to ask and eventually somebody explained. The three course meal was like pig slop.

After booking the hotel through Contiki (the tour leave from the hotel) we read the reviews on Tripadviser and freaked out!! We tried to change our accommodation but would've lost all our money so we prepared for the worst! We flew in at 6am to Heathrow from Sydney and were tired and exhausted but took the tube on the Picadilly line straight to Russell Square station. Beware the 195 stairs! Take the lift to the street! It was a short walk to the Royal National, passing the Tesco across from the station. Walking up the street, our first impressions upon entering the courtyard was OMG this place is MASSIVE and so DEPRESSING looking! The foyer was quite pleasant though. After being told we couldn't check in until 2pm, we left our luggage in the luggage room. Despite dying for a shower and food, we saw the queue out the door of the Windsor breakfast room & after hearing about the terrible breakfasts, didnt want to risk it so decided to go for a walk. We found the shopping complex past Tesco and the Carluccio cafe chain. Thankgod for Carluccio's is all i can say! We had breakfast there every day for our stay (even though we had breakfast included in our accommodation!) best italian coffee & pastries and a deli with meats & cheeses & breads so you could buy to make sandwiches for your lunch. We then went back towards the hotel & got on a Big Bus Tour which leave from outside the hotel and cost us 18 pounds. It takes you via various routes around the city to all the tourist attractions and you can hop on and hop of f when you feel like it. It was an absolute god-send and we proceeded to spend the next 4 hours on the bus going around the city. Good way to waste time when you are tired & jet lagged & lets you get your bearings of the city. Soon it was 1pm, headed back to hotel & checked in with about 200 other people! Yes the hotel is busy & full of students but suprisingly, also full of people who were 60 years plus! After we finally found our room and to be honest, it was in a pretty good state. Yes its old and needs refurbishing, but everything was spotlessly clean - first thing we did was pull back the bed covers & inspected the sheets and they were clean! Bathroom was also clean with running hot water! Tv worked. Beds were comfortable and there is enough room for your bags (which we never unpacked). We did notice no hairdryer (mine blew up upon first use) and so we went to reception and were told to go to house keeping. After getting lost, we found it & were shocked at the 20 pound deposit!!! we got an old dryer but at least it worked! First night we slept like babies due to the jet lag, but in the morning we were woken at 5am by slamming doors and a tour bus leaving in the courtyard which our room overlooked. We had breakfast out and spent the rest of the day sightseeing and only returned to our room at night. Our rooms were clean. The hotel has internet terminals for a fee downstairs on the north side of the hotel though the connection isnt that great! 2nd night was harder sleeping as you notice the sirens every half hour or so, the hotel is in the Hospital zone of London, but you get used to it. We luckily must've been on a quiet floor as there wasn't one party in the hallway the whole time of our stay! The rest of the stay was pleasant. Prior to leaving on our 2 week tour I checked a backpack of souveniers into the luggage room for 2 weeks (for a fee, about 50 pence a day i think) thinking i'd never see it again! I was happy & suprise after returning 2 weeks later it was still there!! We stayed 1 more night and organised the night reception to book us a transfer to stanstead airport for 5am the next morning. Staff were helpful. Next morning the transfer was waiting for us at exactly 5am. Overall, our stay at the Royal National was good. Hotel is in a fantastic location, it felt safe walking around at night, plenty of restaurants nearby, tescos and waitrose close and a shopping centre and most of all the price is fair for what you get. It meets all your basis needs provided you don't expect 5 star luxury! and yes you do get sick of seeing so many people around but you have to be tolerant when travelling! I would stay there again if on a budget :)", "Date": "April 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spalding", "Title": "\u201cIdeal for a room and central location\u201d", "Author": "DCFC09", "ReviewID": "UR15340560", "Content": "On reading up the reviews on the hotel I was worried about my stay here at the Royal National.

For checking in there is no charge for leaving your bags here however for checking out it costs 50p. I stayed in a triple room, this was a very good size and was also very clean. The rooms are not meant to be 1st class, for the money you pay would you really expect this? There was a good sized bathroom with a bath/shower and in the room a tv was available. The rooms were just like staying in your average travelodge. The breakfast was good, i read some of the reviews and was dreading it, however there are two different places, the south and the north side of the hotel, we did not realise this untill when we met back up with our friends after breakfast we realised we had eaten in different places. All the breakfast are the same however on the south side you choose what you would like and put that on your plate however the north side they do it for you. The south side has the main reception area, here is a nice bar with friendly bar staff. For the ice cream lovers there was a ben and jerrys ice cream vending machine!! The location of the hotel was central, it was out of the way of the busy london however it was not to far away either. It was about 200m walk to the tube station, on this line it could take you straight to leicester square and if you wanted oxford circus or bond street you only had to change at holborn and this was the next stop along. I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and would definately stay there again for a room if i was staying in London.

I never got a decent night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep, and really missed my good ol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 American mattress back home. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 So Many Kids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I have nothing against children or teenagers, but in the hundreds they can be overwhelming and loud, plus they made getting in an out of the hotel a chore at times. Also, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on an upper floor and heading out in the morning, finding an elevator that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not packed with kids is almost impossible. Not to give the wrong impression, I was impressed by how well-behaved and polite they were; there were just too many of them. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Really Busy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c depending on when you arrive/leave, checking in or out of this hotel can involve a substantial wait. Accommodating very large student groups does have its drawbacks. Notes: If you arrive before check-in time (2 pm) they offer free baggage storage, which is quite convenient. If you like to use washcloths or hand towels, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to bring your own; they only provide a rug/towel for the floor outside the tub, and bath towels. The continental breakfast is somewhat bare-bones: toast & rolls (with butter and jelly alongside), cereal (rice crispies, corn/bran flakes, and a Muselix type blend), milk, orange juice, and orange & grapefruit slices. During my visit, one could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to an English breakfast for an additional 4 pounds (about $8). It had two pieces of sausage, a slice of ham, a poached egg, scrambled eggs and porridge/oatmeal. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heart-smart, but it sure was filling. Because the hotel can hold about 2,500 people, breakfast can involve a short wait, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re remarkably efficient at keeping things moving. Suggestions: I made the mistake of following a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice and changing currency at the airport. The rate was murderous there. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest exchanging a small amount of currency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 pounds or so \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a local bank before departing, then using the local currency exchange agencies (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even one in the Royal National Hotel lobby) or the ATM machines in the hotel/area. The rates are much better that way, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get the best bang for your undervalued buck.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego CA", "Title": "\u201cA good budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "M-Hayden", "ReviewID": "UR14419469", "Content": "This is a budget hotel.

The hotel is located next to Russell Square on the Picadilly Underground line (go left when you exit the tube station, turn right at the intersection. Go half way down the block and the hotel is on the left side) It caters to tour groups, so check in can be very busy depending on when you arrive (we caught a break and were in quickly), but it can be packed, so be prepared. The room is very basic and was fairly clean - There is a coffee maker in the room, but no hair dryier, microwave or fridge. Also there is no air conditioning, and heating was done with a radiator. There is some black mold because of humidity issues (no vent in the bathroom and the thick curtains by the window), but I was not worried by it. - Hint: fold the curtian up into the window sill to expose the radiator and it will heat the room much better. The room we had overlooked the center courtyard, and it was noisy when the kids came or went, but after a while you don't really notice it. The continental breakfast was basic: Juice, tea/coffee, toast/rolls, cerial; and it reminded me of a chow line in jail (although the ones in jail are more orginized). I didn't try the cooked breakfast (above plus eggs, bacon, beans). It gets crazy in the chow room when the busses are getting ready to leave so go early to miss it. I recommend going across the street to the little cafe to get a better breakfast for the about the same amount - and they make a great \"jacket potato\" (stuffed potato) for lunch or late dinner.

Good central location and we were out most of the time (just as well) no fridge, or any other little helpful extras of ANY kind. Take my word, spend a bit more and get even the basics in other Hotels.

I don't think I've ever stayed at a bigger one. It's full of school trips and organised tours from all over the world. Goodness knows how they organise it, but they do! Check in was quick and easy. As a couple we were disappointed to find our room was a couple of single beds that couldn't be easily pushed together. We went straight back down and pleaded our case (it was Valentine's day!) and they immediately changed it to a more suitable room. I had sent my husband a Valentine's card in advance and it was waiting for him when we arrived. Top marks for service! The room was basic and reasonably clean. The beds were a little small and were on wheels so every time you moved it would travel across the room a little! There was a TV with plenty of channels and some radio too. The bathroom was clean and functional - I guess that's all I can say! The room could do with being updated but then it's a basic place to rest your head, so I wonder if there is any point in doing so? It was noisy too, a natural effect of having so many people in and out of rooms all the time. Breakfast reminded me of being back at school, in the queue for the canteen. Having said that the food was fine! There were several bars with a pretty cheap pint considering this is the middle of London! My husband and I spent an entertaining hour after we'd been to the theatre watching the school parties attempt to get served, and guessed who would and wouldn't be served alcohol. Tip for teenagers - don't look too trendy, like a shop assistant in Top Shop. Only young girls dress like that so you instantly look too young to buy alcohol! The hotel is very close to Russell Square tube station. All in all I don't think I would go back to the Royal National. It is very good at catering for large parties and organised tours. It service is excellent and it's very convenient, but it's just not really for me.

We stayed here in Nov. 2007. We really wanted to stay at the Holiday Inn, on Coram St., about a half block away, as we had stayed there 2 years ago, and loved the location. But the Holiday Inn was too expensive.So, I booked the Royal National Hotel through British Airways. The price was $118 per night, for 2 persons, including all taxes and continental breakfast. That is cheap, for London. The location is great. If you arrive at Heathrow Airport, get on the tube, and get off at the Russell Square stop. When you come out of the tube station - there is only one entrance - walk across the street and turn left. Then walk down to the next big street, Woburn. Cross Woburn Street, and turn right. The hotel entrance is about 50 feet on your left. The rooms are actually a bit larger than those at the nearby Holiday Inn. The bathroom is large, and has a tub. But there were mildew stains in the bathroom. I guess I could have gone out and brought a bottle of bleach and scrubbed the tiles - but that's not my job. Our room looked out over a courtyard of sorts, and was quiet. The worst part was the skinny mattress on the bed - not comfortable at all. The heat worked well, and was easy to regulate ( no A/C in the rooms ). The continental breakfast was miserly - tea or coffee, a diluted orange drink, white bread, butter and jam. This is the only place in the UK where I have ever had a lousy cup of tea. My wife refused to drink the coffee, so we had to go to Starbucks every morning. This is a huge hotel - well over a thousand rooms.If they would put a decent bed in the room, I might recommend it. This is London, so bring lots of money .

Also a good Italian, forget the name, but there are eateries all around the place. For a hardy walker, West End is walking distance and of course the British museum and Russell Square park are right near the hotel.

Breakfast was always fine, typical and hot food available on the spot for purchase. Downsides we experienced on this trip - repeatedly had trouble with our door cards. The registration staff are often ESL (learning English) and almost every day we had to have our cards replaced, often 2-3 times. A real drag when you come in from an exhausting day, having to go up and down, and up and down trying to straighten it out.

Later I realised that whenever you arrive at the Royal National there is always a large coach party filled with youths/students just arriving or leaving, it is that type of place and the entrance foyey has the feel of a busy city railway station or airport. It's manic. There was also a large group of middle aged Icelanders booking in as well and looking around I felt embarrased thinking what impression this hotel would give them of England. It's also not much fun booking into a hotel that makes you personally feel cheap. Check in was relatively straight forward but the large groups of teenage parties also waiting to book in didn't fill me with confidence. When I was speaking to the check in staff I was suprised to be handed a card asking me to fill in all my details, similar to the ones you get when you sometimes go to a foreign country, my home address, where I plan to go to next ( I put the London Eye), my passport number, yet I am Englsh and was staying in an English hotel. Again bad vibes. Most hotels I check into also usually swipe my credit card and give me a room card that you usually show when your order a meal, buy drinks, that you then settle up when you check out. Not here again bad vibes... Off to the lifts and a wait with another 50+ guests who have just checked in for space in the lift. Once on the corridor of the floor on which I was staying you get a real feel for the guts of the hotel. I'm wondering if the hotel is protected from refurbishment so that the people who stay can see how rooms in hotels were in the 60's and I'm not kidding. Bare flurecent bulbs everwhere, bruised walls, cheap wooden fire doors and a strange institution feeling somewhere between a bottom of the range hospital and youth hostel. It must be a marvel to its owners as they have and are still managing to squeeze as much money as possible out of tired furnishing fitted probably 40 yrs ago. Into the room and by this time I had realised what I had purchased. The single youth hostel style beds where horrible and the 'property of Royal National hotel' ink prints stencilled on all the tired white linen to prevent you stealing it just added to the overall cheapness of the place.

Finding the hotel and car park wasn't too difficult although you do have to drive around Russell Square to get to the car park entrance. 24 hours was 17GBP and we stayed for 23 hours and 57 minutes! Check in was chaos when we arrived at 3pm but I couldn't work out whether everyone standing was actually in the queue so I went to the front and asked a middle aged British woman where the end of the queue was. She replied \"There isn't one!\" so I asked if there was any sort of system to which she replied \"You just wait!\" This was the only rude member of staff that we came across. So we approached a younger East European woman and just checked in without any wait. We didn't actually push in as everyone seemed to be waiting for their rooms from a tour leader I think. When we got to our room on the 5th floor it looked like the website. A double and single with mustard bedspeads and a camp bed. There was very little room but it was clean and cost less than 90GBP for 4 of us B&B in central London - what more could we expect?? I could have taken a photo of the peeling paint on the door frame or the dent in the bathroom door where someone had banged it into the toilet roll holder but life's too short! The double bed was like a trampoline but the others were fine. The worst thing about the room was that the whole window pain swung around 360 degrees so if you hate the hotel that much you can always jump. This was actually quite worrying but as it was December we kept the windows shut - if it had been Summer I would have panicked about the kids falling out! It was also single pain and the noise at night was far worse than 7th Avenue in New York. Breakfast was ok - just like school! We were given a tray and picked up cutlery from those plastic containers then bacon ,sausage and eggs were put on our plates we could help ourselves to beans, tomatoes and toast. We managed to get a table for 6 but there were tables for 20+ it really was like a school cafe. My egg was rock hard so I went back to ask if there were any runny eggs I was ordered to wait and the woman yelled in the kitchen 2 runny eggs now please and that's exactly what I got. It pays to ask. The hotel location is great. We walked to the top of Shaftsbury Avenue in 15 mins - this takes you to Picadilly Circus. We also got to Oxford Street in the same sort of time. It is very close to the British Museum and abot 20 mins walk from Covent Garden. We didn't use the tube at all. When you think about the cost the hotel is absolutely fine.

The bathroom in our room looked like it has been renovated lately. Cons - someone wrote here on tripadvisor.com - \"is it a hotel or a bus station\"? well, I couldn't agree more. As for the hotel looks - it could use a serious update. seems like time has stopped in the 1970s there. Our room was very basic, like a youth-hostel room (apart from the bathroom which I mentioned earlier). The hotel has over 1600 rooms (this fact is mentioned on their publications), so there are always lines. A line for checking in, a line for checking out, a L-O-N-G line for breakfast, a line for the luggage room, you get the point. The morning we arrived, at about 11 am, we waited for about 20 minutes till we got to the check-in counter. We were told the room isn't ready yet. When we asked if we could at least complete the check in procedure so we could have the room key for later we were told it's impossible and were asked to come back \"anytime after 14:00\". We left our luggage in the luggage room (not a room, but an unused huge convention hall) and went out. We got back to the hotel at around 15:00. The check in line was SO long we decided to go out again and come back later. Finally, at 19:00, after a (short) 10 minutes line, we got our room. BTW, this was a $150 USD per night room.

Upon our arrival, despite the fact that the party organiser had confirmation of the booking, the staff seemed unable to find any record of it and we were left standing in the foyer whilst something was sorted out. I was appalled that there was nowhere to sit, especially as some members of the party were quite clearly having difficulty standing for so long. When one disabled lad was no longer able to stand and slumped to the floor by the side of the reception desk a member of staff came storming out of the door yelling that he had knocked papers off a desk at the other side of the wall and that he'd been 'at it all day'. An impossibility as we'd been travelling down from Lancashire most of the day, but it certainly felt like we'd been there all day. I suggested the fault lies not with the guests but with the poor structure of the hotel 'walls' as the same thing quite clearly happens with other people. Far from being yelled at the lad deserved an apology for having been made to stand there for so long. When we finally did get our keys and found our way to the rooms I was appalled by the state of the room. To say that it was basic is an understatement. I am amazed that the hotel had managed to acquire 3 stars. The furnishings, such as they were, a basic laminated chip board 'dressing table' and laminated chip board panels attached to the wall in lieu of headboards, were dirty and there was mould on the ceiling in the bathroom. Although a kettle was provided in the room it took over 20 minutes to warm up and then switched off before it reached boiling point. It would have been impossible to make a cup of tea. The advertised hair drier was non-existant. My husband, the coach driver, had enquired how long we could leave the coach in the hotel courtyard and was told that it would be OK to leave it there whilst we checked in. We then took it to an overnight coach park at the end of Bayswater Road. The following morning we left the party having breakfast and went to pick up the coach. Some of them had not finished by the time we returned and so we sat at one of the outdoor tables with the party organiser to have a drink of hot chocolate and wait for them. When the organiser went off to look for people one of the staff came up to my husband and told him to move the coach as it shouldn't be left there. He replied that we'd just brought it in to pick people up. The staff member then said that the coach had been there for well over an hour which was not permitted. I pointed out that less than half an hour earlier the coach had been in a coach park at the end of Bayswater Road, whereupon he accused me of lying saying that he had seen it there himself an hour earlier. It had been there well over an hour the previous evening whilst the reception staff kept us waiting for the keys to our rooms, nothing was said about it then. The chap then went off and spoke to a member of our party who informed us that he'd asked her if this was her coach and when she'd replied that it was he told her. \"That's your driver over there. He isn't looking after you properly.\" She knew exactly where the driver was as she'd spoken to us moments earlier when my husband had been asking if she knew how many people had still to finish breakfast. The toilet facilities in the hotel seem to be a bit thin on the ground. The gents toilets at one side were not even working on the Saturday morning and the hand dryers in the ladies were neither use nor ornament. The loo paper was that cheap and nasty variety all hard and horrible. I have never come across such ignorant and offensive hotel staff anywhere in the world. Nor have I come across such a basic hotel which has somehow managed to acquire 3 stars. We certainly won't be returning and will be advising everyone we know to avoid it and the other hotels in their group which presumably are of the same appalling quality.

The Hotel is very large, and this in itself is problematic. the Hotel itself reminds me of a military barracks, the size, function and meal facilities. On checking in, it was a massive free for all, no queing, with the Staff appearing to pick and choose who they should see next. There are no ironing facilities available in the Room. Although there is 1 iron and ironing board available for the whole hotel set in a room next to 202. My room was about the furthest from reception, but that can't be helped. Unfortunately the window was jammed open and the noise outside was terrific. So I had to do the trek back with luggage. I had to fight to get seen again and to get another room, also very far away. The room itself was basic, and generally not too bad, but the bathroom needed a lot to be desired. A lot of mould and the showerhead was welded in position facing a wall, so you had to do gymnastics to get a shower. No shower gel was available, merely bars of soap. Only basic tea and coffee facilities, and not much of that. No satellite TV available. Breakfast was awful, even the full english. It was in a cafeteria type setting, with all the tables pushed together, again very reminscent of a military setting. The food was 'dumped' on your plate, no self service. Both beans and tomatoes had run out and the eggs were very weary looking. One tiny sausage was eventually found, hiding underneath a bean. The Tea and Coffee were out of an urn (I told you it was military), although to be fair the Tea was fine. I couldn't find any sachets of Suger, only to find they had dispensers on each table to fit in with the general surroundings. The fruit drinks were watered down, but this is usual practice in many London hotels. Again, at check out, if you wanted them to look after your luggage, it was 50p. Not much, but I have never known any other hotel to make a charge. On return, there were dozens of bags of luggage and I was told to find my own! Check out was prompt and quick. If you are not paying the full rate, and are not staying too long, then this is probably okay for a night, possibly two. However, if you are paying full rate or for a longer period - look elsewhere.

My husband and I took our grandson on a wonderful 4 week site seeing holiday. The only part of our holiday that was spoilt was our stay at the Royal National. I refuse to call it a hotel as that suggests that its part of the \"hospitality trade\" and we received NO hospitality from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. On the contrary the staff were rude and ignorant. We booked for 3 nights and only stayed because there was no where else to go. It was Wimbledon week and the Hotels in the metro area were fully booked. We arrived at the Royal National at 9am (our flight got into Heathrow at 6am) after standing in one of the 4 long queues at the check in deck and asking politely if we could check in our cases, I was told by an unsmiling abrupt young woman that I could not check in until 2pm followed by a glare and \"DO YOU UNDERSTAND\" Well yes I did understand even thought it wasn't me that was speaking in a foreign accent. We returned to the check in deck queues at 2pm and was given the key and directions to the lift in the same manner as before from a different young woman. We had booked and paid for a triple room and was given a very small twin room. I returned to the check in desk and said they had made a mistake. I was told there was no mistake they were bringing a roll away bed to put into this room. When I said there is no room for another bed I was told there is, we always use that room as a triple. Housekeeping brought another bed and even they had great difficulty in squashing it into this room, leaving it so all 3 beds were butted up against each other and we had to climb over the top of them as there was no room around them. My Husband asked to speak to the manager of which there appeared to be none, a supervisor did eventually come out of a room at the rear of the check in deck, only to tell him there are no other rooms available, and if he wasn't happy with the room to contact our travel agent in Australia or go somewhere else. We were shocked but did manage to get the number of the wholesale agent in London who said they would look into it. I don't know if it was the agent or the fact that we said we would contact health and safety regarding squashing three beds into a twin room (making one large bed) that caused them to suddenly find a triple room, your guess is as good as mine. We were told that the triple room had been trashed and had just been repainted, and if we could stand the smell of the paint we could have this room instead. We took the room despite the smell and the tacky furnishings as it was a triple room with some space to move as well as space between the beds. Overall the impolite and uncaring attitude of the staff throughout our stay made the whole situation worse. A little understanding, a smile, a comment of \"we will try our best\" is all they need to offer any paying guest. This would make a world of difference and let's face it that is what the hospitality trade is all about. \"HOSPITALITY\" I suggest that the owners and staff learn the meaning of the word or get out of the trade. I agree with the comments other guests have written regarding the noise, breakfast, the shabbiness, and unsupervised behavior of some young guests. Quite honestly I feel even the \"Backpackers\" should think twice before booking in there.

We retrieved our bags later on and went to our rooms, which were very basic but really clean, bathroom just average ok in the scheme of things, a budget hotel after all, what do you want right? Ok ,so far so good, then, got ready and went to the bar for a drink, at this point you really started to notice how many guests were coming and going, I mean droves of them, by the coachload. We ordered a drink, which were really good value and sat down. We tried to go into an outside seating area, opposite the bar,as it was so busy, it was like being in a departure lounge at an airport I was told they had lost the key, it was hot so we asked a member of staff if the aircon was on, he told us the owners could not afford to put the aircon on and if we were hot to go outside! You have to imagine it was like a carpark with coaches and buses coming and going all of the time. We had one drink and left, on our return, you guessed there was still coaches, by the bucket loads, coming and going. We went to bed and all was well till 0130, when the noise of shouting, screaming woke us up. I looked out the window and loads of people appeared to be having a party, on their own windowsill. They had the window opened wide and were shouting and screaming to each other from one side of the hotel to the other, spanish by the sounds of it. This went on for ages and lasted till around 0330. We tried reception said they had several complaints already and were sending members of staff up but nothing seemed to work. Anyway we got up and went, bloodshot eyed, to breakfast. Think, staff canteen/ on a very bad day with a voucher for either continental/buffet. The chap at the entrance was like a bouncer at a seedy club, putting his arm in front of guests, until they showed him tickets, his mate was walking up and down the full english queue, pulling the unfortunates out if they did not have the ticket! The breakfast was horrible, they could have had mine, the breakfast room was like clapton juntion, that was where all the bus loads went! Unfortunately we had to stop another night, we had more of the same and got woke up with a early call, which we didnt request. The cleaner banged on the door for at least two minutes, when I answered, she asked in very broken english, how long would it be before I left the room, er Hello!! It was a SUNDAY AT 0740! I told her, she gave me a disgusted look and pointed to the do not disturb door hanger, I should have hung it on the door, silly me. We also had to put our bags in the waiting area until it was time to leave, we waited in a queue for 20 minutes, only to get the front and told it was full up so go over the road and put in that one, at 50p a pop. I complained and was told by a flustered member of staff to leave it at the station it I didnt like it, fair do's. So, budget hotel all be it but no excuse at all the everthing else. It was a waste of time complaining, as the staff did not care at all, even the duty manager, he was the one who told me to go the station.

I would like to give our honest assessment of the place. I will start by saying that it is not as bad as most of the reviews. If you are looking for an inexpensive hotel and don't mind large tour groups then don't worry. It is very efficiently run and has a large concierge desk with a pleasant staff. It is the only inexpensive thing you will find in London! First, the negatives: there are large teenage tour groups from all over the world, teenagers take over the hotel. They fill up the lobby and the elevators. Don't even think about going into the London Pub! Twice we were kept awake because they were yelling at each other through the windows. I did call down to complain and the yelling soon stopped. The twin bedded room we shared was small. There was an adequate closet but drawer space was limited so that we had to keep some things in suitcases. There were chairs to put these on so we managed ok. Rooms are not air conditioned but it was a cool week so we really didn't need it, opening the window made it comfortable. The room lacked a full length mirror but that is a minor complaint.. Next, the positives: the room and bathroom are perfectly clean. the room was cleaned and fresh towels brought by at least eleven in the morning. The bathroom sink has a counter and plenty of room under it to store cosmetic bags, etc. The plumbing is excellent with a strong shower and plenty of hot water. Whar was wrong with the contintental breakfast? We ate anywhere between seven and ten in the morning and never had trouble finding a seat or having to wait on line to get in. Roles, cold cereal, sliced (canned) fruit , toast , juice, and coffee. What else is there? There was both regular and decaf (brewed) along with skim, whole milk, or half and half, they even had artificial sweetener, nothing to complain about here! There is also a \"London Coffee Shop\" on the premises if the hotel breakfast doesn't please you, and several other coffee shops nearby, even a Starbuck's. There is also a small travel agency which will book tours and tickets at no extra charge, a kiosk for developing digital pictures, a currency exchange desk, computers charging 1 pound, which is equal to about $2.00, for fifteen minutes. I forgot to menition the buffet restaurant, the food is not that good but it comes in handy if you are in a hurry. There is a quiet bar and cocktail lounge in the back part of the lobby which draws adult patrons. Now for the best part, the LOCATION!!! It is in a lovely area with restaurants and shops of all types very nearby. Five bus lines stop next to the hotel, and the Russell Square Underground station is a block and a half away. The Picadilly Line stops there and that line takes you to just about every main sightseeing attraction either directly or with one change in a matter of minutes. My advice to anyone, this is really a great bargain as long as you don't require luxury, but, unless you are under 25, DON'T GO ANYTIME WHEN SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES ARE ON VACATION!!!

Having booked it through British Airways' website more than two weeks ago at a rate of \u00c2\u00a375 per night I decided to read other users' comments at TripAdvisor before coming into the hotel and was slightly disappointed with my choice I had made, I even was worried about it: most of the comments were recent and rather negative. Okay, when I arrived at the hotel I realised that almost all that had been said here about it was true. Moreover, I disclosed that the published standard rate for everyone (including those walk-ins) is less than I pre-paid through [--], - \u00c2\u00a368. The hotel itself looks like a big airport with two terminals - a South and a North. Being warned by those who have stayed with Royal National about crowds of Spanish-students-night-loudspeakers I asked at check-in \"a very quiet room\" and I think I got it. The room is clean, the bed is quite good. The bedroom is rather uncomfortable and is very tiny. I had my continental breakfast only once, yesterday. Cereals, orange juice, plenty of butter, bread and strawberry jam, filtered \"American\" coffee (even worse that it could have been somewhere in East-Siberia) or tea. So, today I have decided to stay in bed instead of going downstairs for having this breakfast. English breakfast is also available but for a \u00c2\u00a37 surcharge and a long queue is unavoidable. I went out from the hotel and found a lot of nice cafes offering the same for little money and without queueing. The hotel is right in the centre of London and Russel Square tube station is nearby. It is worth if you a walker and if you do not spend much time inside your room. Thus I would recommend to everyone who prefers more comfort and who's got used to nice small luxury hotels, not to stay with the Royal National.

Our deserts were brought to us on a desert trolly that had been out the whole time we were there no refrideration. We went back to the hotel and tried to sleep where I enjoyed my champagne that was sitting in a dirty plastic water jug! The hotel was NOISY!! all you heard all night was screaming and sirens.

I asked that the champagne be removed from the room and was told by yet another person who didnt speak much English \"that champagne was not complimentary\" (Neither was my walllett) When I raised my voice I was getting angry I was told \" We will call security\" and they ran off to the back office. I did try to leave but because it was past 4:00pm they refused to refund my money for that nights stay and I didnt have my credit card and there was no hotel rooms available. to cut this short no one (apart from the porter Fergal) was willing to help, I was treated rudley and disrespectful the whole time there is no manager on duty and no one speaks English, I was willing to overlook the dustfilled room but this was way to much oh and the breakfast if you like dryed up food then you will love it!!

The lobby was a madhouse, the staff at the desk were harried and rude, the hotel had no triples available and Vicki, the reception clerk who clearly wanted me to just go away, informed me that they did not in fact have beds that could be wheeled in to a double to make a triple. Instead, I had to book a single room for my older daughter for the first two nights. On the third night, I'd have to go find a double elsewhere, as the hotel was fully booked. Our rooms were a disappointment. The furniture was cheap and I'm guessing that it was at least two decades old, though in terms of style -- and I use that term generously -- it appeared to be from the '60s or '70s, which was also the approximate date of the built-in push-button panel next to one bed that controlled the TV and lights. No clock or radio in the room. A phone, but local calls were emphatically not free. The bedspreads were faded. There was an electric kettle in each room, and a packet containing a tea bag, beverage whitener (yes, that's what it said) and instant coffee. In the single, the electric kettle was filthy, there was a damp towel in the tub, and an accumulation of dust and hair behind the sliding bathroom door. The curtains in both rooms didn't close completely, and had to be held in place by propping the desk chair against the window sill. The double room (6106) had a view of the offices and classrooms of the University College of London across the street and the homeless people who slept on the sidewalks at the base of the building. The single room (6108) had a view of the gigantic courtyard of the hotel, and even with the window shut and a chair holding the curtains in place, it was extremely noisy at all times, with an endless parade of vehicles, tour guides shouting out instructions to their groups, young adults yelling to one another, pub goers returning in the wee hours of the morning, and tour buses beeping as they backed in at 5 a.m. to pick up people who were going out to the airport for an early flight. Each room had just one towel in it (not counting the dirty one thathad been left in the single room). When I asked for additional towels I was instructed to go to the first floor, find the housekeeping office, and see what they could do for me. I did so, signed for the additional towels, and returned the dirty one at the same time. Our \"free\" hotel rooms were clearly not a very good deal. But things got worse: at 3:30 a.m. we were literally jolted out of our beds by an extremely loud fire alarm. While ordinarily this might have been merely inconvenient, two bombs had been found in London that week, the country was on high security alert, and as I and my two children were herded down six flights of stairs with hundreds of other guests we were terrified and wondering if we were a target. At the bottom of the stairs we found ourselves in a small, fenced-off parking lot, held in close to the building by an eight-foot chain-link gate. After about five minutes a staff member came and unlocked the gate, so we could go to the assembly area near the courtyard. Eventually we were allowed to climb the stairs back to our rooms.... ...only to have the fire alarm go off a second time shortly after five. We left the hotel again, this time taking a different fire exit so we wouldn't feel trapped in the fenced-in parking area. When we talked about this experience the next morning, we discovered that as we moved briskly down the stairs the three of us were thinking some of the same things. Was there a bomb in the hotel? a fire? When we got to the bottom of the steps, what would we find? Is this the smartest thing to be doing, to be carried along by this massive crowd? Is this happening at other hotels too, to distract emergency services while something truely horrible happens somewhere else? We felt very vulnerable. Shortly after we arrived in the hotel's courtyard the crowd suddenly panicked, and ran out into the street. We followed suit, not running but walking quickly and staying out of the main press of people. I positioned us behind a stairway on the building across the street, not far from where a homeless person was sleeping, oblivious to the thousands of swarming people. The fire alarms were probably just a prank, and certainly weren't the hotel's fault, but they did nothing to enhance our sense of security at the Royal National. And there was no acknowledgement that this might have been inconvenient or unpleasant for the guests. No regrets, no apology. We slept in in the morning, and barely made it to breakfast on time. At breakfast I decided that the Royal National doesn't cater to guests, it processes them. Breakfast was held in a huge, huge room full of tippy tables pushed very close together. The buffet for the full, cooked breakfast, to which my older daughter was entitled, through the single room we'd purchased for her, was on one side, and was closely guarded by staff, who checked tickets and ordered you away if you were only entitled to a continental breakfast. My younger daughter and I were in no mood for meat and eggs anyway, so we ate a lot of toast with butter and jam and drank some orange juice. We had been looking forward to a nice cup of tea, having developed a real fondness for it, but at the Royal National the tea comes from a gigantic urn, which I suspect has never been rinsed out. It was a profound disappointment. Four nice things about the Royal National: 1. We were able to use our little Mac Book in the lobby, thanks to their wireless internet service. 2. We could pick up a free newspaper in the morning in the lobby. 3. The location is pretty good, close to Russel Square, the tube station and the British Museum. 4. At breakfast they give you real milk to put on your stale cereal or in your undrinkable tea, which is a big step up from beverage whitener. It was wonderful to move to a small, quiet private hotel in Cartwright Gardens for the remainder of our time in London. I and my loved ones will never again stay at the Royal National, or any of the properties belonging to Imperial London Hotels.", "Date": "July 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cyuck\u201d", "Author": "sad6245", "ReviewID": "UR8078068", "Content": "This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

Just a few steps from the Russell Square tube stop, you can get from here to anywhere in Central London in a matter of minutes. That one, given, convenience aside, this hotel is a dump and you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay me to stay there ever again. Upon arriving at the Royal National Hotel, which is gigantic (and not so much in a good way as a college dorm kind of way), my sister and I had high hopes. Sure, there were a lot of kids on school trips with their chaperons but the din of the lobby didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us much. After killing a few hours before check in (2pm), we were told that the reservation, which we booked through Expedia, was nowhere in their system. Now considering that I had a printed confirmation from Expedia in my hand indicating that I paid in full and that the Royal National had already confirmed our room, I was a little bit surprised but in no way defeated. That was, however, until the person behind the desk told me that it was my responsibility to figure out why. He suggested I buy a phone card across the street, which of course, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work in any of the red phone booths outside or the phones in the lobby, to call Expedia myself to ask them about the agency through which they booked the reservation. I didn't really understand how this was somehow MY responsibility, considering I already paid for the hotel, but we just sucked it up and called Expedia from an American cell phone (Not a good idea\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Seriously.) Now if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve booked through Expedia, a generally well known and reputable travel agency, please do yourselves a favor and call the hotel in advance to guarantee your reservation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better than making a ridiculously expensive call from your American cell phone in London to an ordinarily toll free number, surrounded by your bags and massive swarms of children running around, only to be told that you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for your booking (even though you did) and that now you have no place to stay (even though you booked this place months in advance). Eventually, and I hate being the type of person who asks this type of question, I had no choice but to ask if I could speak to a manager. When we did eventually speak to a person higher up, after a miserable TWO HOURS of trying to check in, she pressed a few buttons on her keyboard and told us, in the most non- apologetic tone of all time, that someone at the hotel must have made a silly mistake because the reservation was listed for the day before. Now, only next to my home town of New York, London is my favorite place on earth and I am absolutely devastated that the Royal National Hotel has had the power to in any way taint that. I lived in London for five months and have never come across anything in the UK or elsewhere that can compare to the unhelpful, rude, unaccommodating attitude of this place. Quite fittingly, the rest of our stay at the hotel was just as miserable as its start. The sheets felt as though they had some sort of film on them and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagine that anyone with allergies to dirt, dust, or strange carpets which look as though they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned since 1973 might have a problem staying here. The sink has a really hot faucet and a really cold one, so there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much hope for a nice, lukewarm mix. I asked for a smoking room, banking on the chance that we might be a bit separated from the bus loads of kids and teenagers that run rampant throughout this hotel, but it was still sort of noisy as the walls are quite thin. And this is coming from a New Yorker\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 To top it all off, on our last night, when all we could hope for was a decent night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep before an early train to Paris, we were awoken at 3:30am by a blaringly loud, almost deafening fire alarm. We, along with the other 314,352,632 people staying here had to then proceed out of our rooms down the stairs and into the rain in our pajamas to be told that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153someone who obviously had too much to drink must be playing a prank.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Oh, and as if that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, it happened again an hour and a half later at 5:00am. If you really, truly want to have a good vacation in London, I suggest that you save up your money and stay someplace a little more upscale. Once you get to London and come to terms with that terrible exchange rate, a few hundred dollars will seem like chump change anyway.

We hired a people carrier to get us around and needed a hotel that was central and accessible, and so chose this hotel. I was concerned about the hotel having read the reviews. Having built up a mental picture of a dump, I was amazed at what I saw when I arrived. It was fine. Before retiring I had stayed in many London hotels, and this turned out to be one of the best low/medium priced hotels I has used. It has a cosmopolitan atmosphere with lots of students present, giving a pleasant 'London' feel. All three rooms were very clean and the carpets and decorations looked recently new, and the bathrooms appeared to have been refurbished in the last few months. They were spotless. The tiles, grout and sealants were all unmarked. The beds and sheets were clean and spotless. We arrived and found that there were insufficient coat hangers, so I rang the housekeeping extension and within five minutes a smiling face brought us a dozen more. The breakfasts did not constitute food swimming in fat as some have written. The English breakfast was good. There are two breakfast areas. These are mediocre - the one on the left was a bit like a bus station cafe, but turning right is a larger better facility. Neither are wonderful, but they do the job. There is a problem over privacy. The hotel is configured around a series of courtyards, which means that bedrooms overlook other bedrooms not too far away. The first evening I opened the curtains to look into the bustling area where the coaches arrive, and could hardly avoid seeing two near-naked female students immediately opposite getting ready for a night out. Other guests were coyly looking out of their windows, as the activity in the arrival area is interesting to observe. This problem should not exist and I am surprised that the operators don't have net curtaining as most hotels do, particularly where there is so much overlooking. The hotel is so well positioned. We arrived after a two hundred mile trip from the North and found it so well related to the main road system that we just left the motorway and seemed to fall into the hotel. Parking was fabulous (underneath) and cheap at \u00c2\u00a316 per 24 hour day. Congestion charge was \u00c2\u00a38 for the weekend and Monday. We only paid for the Tuesday, and a machine for the Congestion charge was in the car park but only takes credit cards. There are local newsagents who record the vehicle registration and take the payment so its not a problem. An excellent feature was the convenient walking distance into the centre. We walked into and out of the centre every time, being in Piccadilly Circus in 20 minutes. The walking route is pleasant and not in any way threatening at night. Our friends commented on how 'friendly' the streets were at night. The hotel is great. Ignore the moaners.

We were on the 6th floor and it WAS NOISY (but London is anyway). Little lacking in tea/coffee supplies - horrible powdered milk in sachets uughh - suggest you take your own. We did not make it down to breakfast either of the mornings - there were alot of guests coming and going at all times so we thought there might be a bit of a queue !! We sampled a very nice cafe outside our hotel window which we would definitely recommend (next door to a convenience store). Handy for tube. Only BIG moan was being charged 50p per luggage item for leaving our cases at the hotel before departing later in the afternoon.

On arriving at our room, it was filthy, the domestic services assistant said that they had not cleaned our room yet. this was at 5pm. At approximately 5.15pm, it was announced our room was ready. The bathroom was vile. Marks and stains on the toilet, including in the bowl, a guest soap clogging the bathroom sink and the sink pedestal marked with what looked like dry blood. We also only had 1 towel plus bathmat for a room with 2 people staying in it. On inspection of the room, surfaces where dusty, the carpet filthy, full of bits, and the linen not of a very high standard; infact it was full of holes. The top sheets on both beds were stained with what looked like ink. The kettle was filthy; I would not entertain using it. The hotel in its entirety seemed dirty and mismatched; the corridors are tatty and on more than one occassion it was apparent that a cleaner had burst a bathroom waste bin; the contents of which was then left in the corridor for a number of hours. In order to have breakfast you have to cross a busy courtyard to the other wing; this court yard is frequented by coaches whose drivers show little or no intention of slowing down thier vehicle whilst in this courtyard. making for a dangerous crossing. The english breakfast left alot to be desired,the toast was man handled by all and sundry; poor quality food; topped with dirty cutlery. We stayed at the Royal National as part of a package; I was extremely tempted to check out immediately; but endured the hotel as I had paid for the room prior to staying; and did not want to pay twice for accomodation.

We had read a large number of reviews of the Royal National Hotel on Russell Square, London and went on your break with some trepidation. We were therefore pleasantly surprised to find the room outdated but adequate and clean, although everything else was true to form. The check-in could only be made after 2pm and the queues were very long, unmanaged and chaotic. Many queued up who did not require completing any documentation, and those that did, did not and had to be found, delaying the process. Those having completed check-in merely walked through the other queues to get to the lifts. It could have worked better had a Bank or Post Office style system been employed. Having said that, even though the rooms were not available until after 2pm, I cannot see why continual booking could not have been employed to alleviate the bottleneck. Those that arrived well before time merely deposited their bags with the concierge and went into the city, as we did. We could have booked in and still done that picking up the key on returning after 2pm. We were given a choice of locations for the evening meal and chose the President Hotel around the corner as it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCarvery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The meal was disgusting. The soup was very tasty but cold. The beef , pork and lamb (mutton) was of poor quality, cut into very thick wedges and was tough as old boots and uneatable. The vegetables were in a tureen of water and put on the plate with a spoon that left the plate swimming in water. The roast potatoes were not roasted and were cold. We were not the only ones who thought the same and saw many plates go back with most of the meat still on it, even though the joints had changed. The Hotel itself could be likened to Victoria Coach or Kings Cross stations. It is best described as a Transit Hotel with people coming and going at all hours with no concern for others. The noise throughout the night was horrendous with coaches, taxis and party goers arriving till the very small hours and if you were unfortunate to be allocated a room that overlooked the arrival area (6019) then you were subjected to all the usual noises associated with these arrivals that echoed around and up the square. The bar was an open plan situation just off the main reception and it was impossible to have a quiet drink after returning from the Theatre. After 11pm, there were people arriving who clearly were not resident but found that they could get a drink when the pubs had closed. My wife and I had a room (6058) that overlooked a gardened area near the bar that was locked at 11pm because of the noise it generated. At 1.20am Sunday morning two drunken residents of a room situated above the bar area decided to open their window to its full extent and stand smoking and shouting. This went on till 2.15am. This disturbed many residents who came to their windows and in the end were forced to close them. Security was not in evidence. (The windows should be on a retaining catch to prevent them being opened fully, for safety reasons. It was noticed that many windows in the square were broken or had been overridden) The weekend however was not a complete disaster as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSound of Music\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was excellent and we had booked to see a play on the Saturday evening that was equally good, but we will be very careful in the future in taking a package that includes a hotel like the Royal National. On the 23rd March we received a copy of a reply from Imperial Hotels via our tour operator. The Hotel was surprised by our findings and put it down to a particularly busy weekend but did say that they would pass on comments to their relative departments. Their last comment, for me, put it all into perspective; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were disappointed to note that he did not fully enjoy his stay with us but feel that he may have been expecting a different style of Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that say everything?", "Date": "March 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cClean Hotel Perfect for a busy weekend in London!\u201d", "Author": "LottieWestMidlands", "ReviewID": "UR7189062", "Content": "After reading reviews before staying in the hotel i was really worried especially as i had booked the trip for 5 other people and didn't want them moaning at me.

If you like individual service, cosy and picturesque then this is not for you as it is a large, concrete building, noisy and filled with coach parties. Check in however was smooth and rooms though small were clean and the bathroom was clean. Shower was fine although the shower curtain was thin and there were no toiletries. TV reception was rubbish but we didn't use it as we didn't go to London to watch TV. Worst part of the room was the paper thin walls, you really could hear everything from the room next door and the traffic noise was horrendous. In two nights I counted 30 ambulance sirens. If you are already booked here ask for an inward facing room as my friends had a room facing the courtyard and slept fine. The beds were actually very comfortable. Staff always replied with courtesy, I encountered no rudeness at all but then I always take the time to chat to staff and wish them good morning or good evening. The free complimentary meal on arrival was OK, though it was of canteen standard. The breakfast, I have to admit was the worst cooked breakfast I have ever had in a hotel and the cup of tea was undrinkable.

Even any other Imperial London Hotel, I believe there are 5, all very close in Bloomsbury. I must say, I did check the review's before booking, but figured I could tough it out for the price, after all, they advertise a 3 star hotel. I'll start by saying I had a great time in London, the area was fantastic, but the hotel..... 1. Beware of the included breakfast. The workers are SO rude. You must bring a slip with you that show's you have a breakfast included. We went 1 time. In the 1 time, both my boyfriend and me had the slips ripped out of our hands by the staff on over 5 occasions, to check if we belong there. Then, instead of handing it back to us, they threw it on the floor. Instead of wasting your time there, head out of the hotel, and RIGHT across the street, you'll find a wonderful little coffee shop, which serves great food and has very cheap prices. 2. Beware of the beds! I can't stress enough how comical the beds are. We unfortunately got 2 twin beds, and both were so bad, but one worse. There were springs sticking out (no, really) into our back. We got an extra blanket to try to lie over the mattress, but made the mistake of lifting the sheet. Ok, I don't know what happened in this bed, but the stains were disgusting. We stayed 4 nights, and had to alternate who got the evil bed each night. We actually would have been better off sleeping on the floor, had there not been funk all over the carpet. 3. Evil Towel lady. Each morning, yes, early morning, the maid would continue to knock on the door, and by the 3rd time, would yell at us to get up and get out. Then, we further got chastised when we asked for some clean towels. Are we not paying for the room we are in? Very, very strange. 4. The shower. Again, this is not my first trip to Europe. I've been to about 15 different hotels within Europe in the last 5 years. Unless you are a size 0, and can climb 2 feet to get into the bathtub, you'll be ok. Plus, because it's so skinny, the moldy shower curtain sticks to your body, and then you practically fall out when you're done. Oh... and the water switched from hot to cold ever 10 seconds or so. 5. I can live with the 1970's decor, but be aware, that's what you get. And it's not the good retro 70's...

Now looking back, we would stay outside of the city and look for something a little nicer next time. Overall: The Royal National is a budget hotel in a country whose currency is worth twice that of the US dollar, so unless you want to spend $300 a night on a hotel, your options will be limited to hotels in this class. While they may be dissapointing in their lack of frills, detail and modern styling, they do provide a basic (albeit it small) room with adequate amenities. It's nothing to write home about, so keep that in mind when choosing your hotel. For the price of a hotels in London, this was not that bad. Smoking: The smoking ettiquette in London is so poor in comparison to the USA that is deserves an entire section of commentary on just how bad it is. BE WARNED -- the English smoke everywhere!!! The entire hotel stunk of smoke. People smoked right next to us in restaurants, blowing the smoke in our direction as we tried to eat our meals. Parents smoked and blew smoke into the faces of their small children. There is an utter lack of public decorum about smoking, nor is there any concern about the health risks. IT was just disgusting. We were shocked at how many people smoked in London and how people would chain smoke while eating a meal in a restaurant. The only place we found that had seperate smoking and non-smoking sections was the Indian restaurant on the same block of the hotel (which also had the best food) so we recommend going there). The Room: The room was very small, similiar to what one would expect for a nursery. The single beds were tiny and not particularly brilliant in decor ... the blankets were old looking and my husband did not feel comfortable letting it touch his skin. We tried pushing our two beds together so we could sleep near one another, with little success because the beds shifted apart each time we moved. The TV had four stations: the BBC news, the german channel, the french channel and one with assorted English and US shows. The bathroom: Ours was very clean. There was bar soap and a shower curtain (not all Euro hotels provide curtains for the shower). The only real complaint here was that the toilet lid broke when my hsuabnd sat on it and punctured his buttocks in two places, literally removing a small chunk of his skin in one cheek! The toilet seat cover was so thin and cheap that is gave way when 200 lbs. man sat on it. Rediculous I think. So be warned, do not sit of the toilet seat cover. The Food: Breakfast came in two varieties, continental and full. Since the continental was part of our package deal we had that. It consisted on cold, stale toast that was not particularly tasty; yellow rancid butter (which tasted spoiled -- yuck); watery coffee that tasted pretty bad , tea and assorted cereals and milk. The milk and cereal was actually pretty good and the tea not bad either. If two bowels of cereal and some tea are enough for you, then you will be happy with this option. If not, we recommend walking down to Covenent Garden or to a cafe by the tube and getting a breakfast pastry or sandwich. The full breakfast, which was an addition 6 pounds or $12 US per person offered the addition of scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage. We are not meat eaters so this option was not appealing. And even if we were, the meat looked so greasy, fatty, oily and less than crispy and we heard other Americans comment on the less than high quality. But this was the case every where we went in England -- they just do not have the same taste and standards in food as we Americans do. Growing up in NYC I am spoiled with amazing restaurants and great food on every block. In England the best food we found were the potatoe samosas sold in the tube and the pastries and pocket sandwiches sold at the french cafes. Look for them and try. Also, the INdian restaurant down the block from the hotel was excellent. We had both the lunch and dinner buffet, which were both very reasonable in price and had many delicious meat and vegetarian offerings. Oh, and very delicious desserts too. We very highly recommend this place because the setting was gorgeous, the food amazing and the price for lunch was about $12 per person -- which was the cheapest eats we found our entire stay! Site seeing: We took the river boat tour of the tames, which had very commical commentary from the crew. My husband had some difficulty understanding what was said because of their accents, but I was raised on Monty Python and caught every word, joke and line. The views were lovely. We also took a motor coach tour to Stone Henge, Bath and one Windsor Castle. It was wonderful. About $80 per person, and well worth it! Look around for a reputable tour company and pack your own snacks to keep your energy up and reduce the expense of the site seeing, but def get out of the city and see the rest of England. It snowed for the first time in ten years while we were walking around stone henge, which you can imagine made for truly stunning pictures. Shopping: We found great shopping and prices in the towns of Windsor and Bath. It's worth stepping out of London into the surrounding areas and doing your shopping there because you will save a fortune. In closing: My husband and I had a great time despite the hotel being pretty shabby. We made jokes about how bad the hotel was and kept each other laughing, which did add to our enjoyment and help deminish our dissapointment in the room. On our next trip to England we would probably stay outside of the city and look for higher grade accomodations. But if the Royal National is all you can afford, just go and don't worry about it.

One had giant wheels on which meant if you pushed against it or moved around in the night it would roll around the room alarmingly. And has this hotel never heard of Duvets?

The pub hosts partyers supposedly only till 11pm but on our stay they were still partying hard until 2am! Our room was up on the second floor facing the courtyard and the noise was horrendous. The biggest problem isn't the partyers at the pub. It's the fact that the hotel is built so cheaply! The windows are only single pane so noise travels right through as if they were open! ARGH! We needed to wake up by 6am and worried with the incredible noise that we wouldn't get any sleep at all. My wife called the desk a few times complaining about the noise and reminded them that there own brochure specifies the pubs closing hour at 11pm. They were apologetic but thats about all. A move to another room wouldnt have been much better because the street traffic noise on the outer part of the hotel would have been just as bad!

When we checked out the front desk employees also seemed to take no interest in hearing neither our \"Good morning\" nor or complaint about the night before.

When we arrived to the room in the evening we found a note that they found a crack in the bathroom that might be dangerous for us and therefore we should approach the reservation.

We had our adult daughter (a student in Britain) with us and a cot with minimal padding (maybe 2 inches thick), was supplied, leaving little room for manouvering about. The 2 single beds were creaky and had mattresses that were a little lumpy. The TV and room lights had crossed wires in the bedside switches. The electric kettle didn't work. There were no face cloths and no shampoo in the bathroom. The bathtub had the smallest width of any I've ever seen - standing sideways in it having a shower my toes started curling up the sides (and I have average sized feet). On the positive side the hotel was reasonably quiet, the room readily accessible by elevator (a little surprising given the hotel's large number of guests), there was plenty of hot water in the shower, the continental breakfast quite sufficient though not of noteable quality, and the location is pretty good for those who like to walk to some of the nearby tourist sites and restaurants and pubs, and is close to the Russell Square underground station and about a 10 minute walk to King's Cross railway station. The 2 double decker bus companies that sell tours both have stops right at the hotel. My most serious complaint about the hotel was the lack of any ... any! ... response by the numerous employees in the dining room to assist my daughter when one of the elderly guests spilled hot tea on my daughter's back causing her considerable pain and distress.

Anyways, we booked through British Airways and as part of a package deal we got the room for free. When we arrived it was a bit chilly and we waited for about over an hour for our room in the lobby. We were tired and had a difficult infant with us, so it was a bit trying. While in the lobby we were exposed to second hand smoke. The smoking section is outside, but the door stays open, so the smell travels. Eventually when we went to our room, it was neat and clean, but cold. Housekeeping had left the window open. There was no way to warm up the room. There were 2 twin beds on wheels which is really an accident waiting to happen. The shower was not bad, a bit of a climb into the tub. The faucet did not have a mixer for hot and cold, they were separate. We were only provided with 2 bathtowels- no handtowels or facecloths. Because we had an infant we were required by law to have a crib in the room. The crib took up way too much space in an already small room. Also, no extra blankets were provided for the crib. It looked worn and unsafe, in my opinion. On the plus side we were within walking distance of the British Museum. The hotel restuarant offered excellent Indian dining. All in all we will not stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "May 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh PA", "Title": "\u201cOur stay at the Royal National Hotel better than expected\u201d", "Author": "DS1945", "ReviewID": "UR5068289", "Content": "My wife, Carolyn, and I, and my wifes mum were at the Royal National Hotel on Sunday May 7th and we left on Friday, May 12th, 2006. After reading all the horror stories online, I thought we would have a major problem, but, we were all surprised that things worked out much better than expected. We arrived at the hotel on Sunday, and went right up to the check in desk. Within a few minutes, we had our key card and off to our room for the next five nights. Carolyn is a wheelchair user. She has a spinal cord injury. (L-2) We thought she would have a tough time, but, all in all, it worked out perfect. Carolyn's mum had her own room, right next to ours, which made it easy for the mum to find us. The hotel is located a short walk to the British Museum. And the British Museum is free. Within a few minutes from the hotel, you can walk to the Russell Square tube station, Royal Post Office, and several MAC Machines. A bunch of buses stop right in front of the hotel. You need to know which direction to wait for the bus or else you are going in the wrong direction. The windows in the hotel are old and don't open too easy plus there are no screens in the windows. And like most of London, the hotel does not have AC. Breakfast was in the Windsor Room. Breakfast is served from 7AM to 10AM. The room is huge and there were a lot of tables to pick from. The Windsor Room is on the ground floor, and just a few yards to the hotel registration desk. Here is the selection for breakfast: We had the full English Breakfast, so we could have anything we wanted. The Cont Breakfast is everthing but the hot food. Breakfast included toast, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, bacon, bangers, porridge, baked beans, stewed tomatoes, canned grapefruit and orange sections, orange juice, four different kinds of dry cereal. (Rice Krispies, Bran Flakes, Granola, and Corn Flakes.) Plus rolls and butter and many flavors of jelly. In our hotel room, the potty seat was broken and the inside door handle came off when you opened the door. Both problems were fixed. Lots of hot water and lots of water pressure. A small problem in the bathroom sink. Hot and cold do not come out together. The water in the tub does come out together. The bathtub is long and narrow. The bed and pillows are both very hard. Didn't see any bedbugs but the carpet in the hallway could use a good cleaning or else just replaced. Since the hotel is seven stories high, and long hallways, that would cost a small fortune to replace the carpet. The signs posted that Breakfast is served on each floor is incorrect. The only place you can have breakfast is in the Windsor Room on the ground floor. I bought a converter to charge up my camcorder batteries and Carolyn's hair dryer. The converter I came with didn't work. Housekeeping will loan you a three prong plug and hair dryer for a small deposit, which you get your money back when you return what you borrowed. Don't use the phone in the room to make any phone calls locally, or else you will pay a small fortune. The phone in the room is good for room to room calls, or else to the front desk or for a wake up call. There are three pay phones in the lobby. The pay phones take change from 20p up to \u00c2\u00a31. A little window on the pay phone tells you how much time is left. The hotel does not supply you with a wash cloth or shampoo. Within a short walk of the hotel you will find a Pizza Hut, Subway, (not the tube but a Subway sandwich shop), and many Italian Restuarants. We used the same bank of lifts (elevators). Next to the bank of four lifts is a money exchange booth. The hotel is just a few minute walk to the Russell Square Tube Station on the Piccadilly Line. This station does have three lifts, but, you still need to walk 20 steps to the platform. When you leave the Russell Square tube station, turn left. Walk to the traffic light. You will see the Royal Post Office. Turn right and you'll see the Royal National Hotel on the left. In conclusion, the RNH is not the the best place to stay, but, its really in a great location for places to eat, and catch the tube or the bus, You can take the Piccadilly Line from Heathrow to Russell Square without changing tubes. Its around an hour tube ride. A one time ride will be \u00c2\u00a34.00. or an all day travelcard zone 6 to zone 1 is \u00c2\u00a36.30. I bored you enough. This review is done.

This was our first trip to London, so I can truly offer a tourist's opinion about this hotel. First, yes, the hotel is a bit older and a bit worn. We jokingly categorized it as a youth hostel for adults since it offers basic rooms with average beds, towels you can almost see through and one, tiny bar of soap as your only bathroom amenity! However, we found the room clean enough not to panic (although dusty from an open window with no screen), and the hotel is located in a nice, seemingly secure neighborhood. We had a room facing the inside courtyard which was very quiet (no traffic noise). Fortunately, we experienced a very quiet stay unlike reviews from others on this site. The best thing about this hotel is the fact that it offers a very convenient, safe, tourist-friendly location right across the street from the Russell Street Tube (on the Picadilly Line which will get you easily to any tourist sites you'll wish to visit) and terrific nightly rates for London. Other advantages tourists may enjoy: on-site coffee shop and pub, HSBC (major bank in London) ATM on the corner, money exchange in the hotel with good rates, two grocery stores within a block (one open 24 hours), the British Museum is a 5 minute walk, friendly porters that help with directions and tour information, and London's two major sight seeing bus companies sell tickets and pick up at the hotel's entrance (very convenient). We were also allowed to check in at 1100 when we first arrived from the airport. The hotel is a 1.5 to 2 star property for tourists who want a good rate, a convenient location and a simple place to rest at night. I would not suggest staying here if you plan to spend a great deal of time in the hotel, if you want to impress a travel companion or if you require more sophisticated amenities. Would I go back? Yes, if the hotel is still a bargain. I would not pay more to stay at this hotel; however, what it offers at current rates is adequate for a quick visit.

However, they are clean and comfortable and quite adequate, unless you are flying to London to spend all your time in a hotel room.

If you're not interested, just go all the way to the bottom and read about the amenities and key points. The concierge are actually *porters*, so do not expect them to have appropriate concierge-esque (?) knowledge. Only about 1/6 of them are kind and willing to help; many just blink at you if your question doesn't relate to where to find the laundrette or pub. Very, very rude. A friend of mine and I had a flight to Dublin at 6am and required a taxi at 4:00am. We confirmed our wake-up call and pre-arranged taxi with the porters TWICE, as well as the operator. Wouldn't you know, the taxi wasn't there and many blessings on my friend's alarm clock that morning... It can get quite noisy at night, especially if your room is on the 'inside,' facing the courtyard (smoking area by the bar). Bring some earplugs -- the walls are thin! Bring your own alarm clock -- phone-requests are either 15 minutes early, late, or never!

On the second day of my visit, my laptop, camera and other items were stolen from me in the hotel lobby. I turned my back to put on my coat and when I turned back - they were gone. The security guards (the only kind souls, besides the wonderful housekeeping staff) caught it on video but were not there to assist because they don't come in until 3:00p.m. Interestingly enough, the same two thieves snatched a purse just two days prior from the same place in the lobby, at approximately the same time. Be warned... Breakfast in the morning is every man/woman/child for themselves. :) Go early...toast, cereal, bread rolls and jam/butter are available. There is also a hot-food bar for a fee (sausage/bacon/fruit/eggs/tinned tomatoes). Bring your own coffee or tea...blech! However, the free(included) breakfast was the best part of my stay. :) If you have sensitive skin, be aware that many people have minor allergies to the soap used on the linens. I know this because I was traveling with a college-student group that returns to this hotel twice a year, and many of the students break out in a rash due to the harsh soap. The rooms were quite clean and, as I mentioned previously, the housekeeping staff is friendly and accomodating. Shirin was the housekeeper on our floor, and she was quite helpful (especially when I had to move rather quickly for security reasons after the theft). Remember - washcloths are not provided in the UK; bring your own. There is a tour-booking booth just outside of the hotel, and a theatre-tickets booth inside the lobby. The location of the hotel is BRILLIANT; just 1 1/2 blocks from Russell Square tube station, and across the street from a bus stop. The British Museum is within walking distance (5-10 minutes). A 'Tesco Express' (grocery store) is across the street from the tube stop, and multiple restaurants are nearby. A laundrette (fluff and fold or do-it-yourself) is about 2 blocks away; athough the facility is small and expensive (expect to pay approx. 7-8 pounds for one load of wash and dry), the staff is friendly. An American-Express office is just one block beyond the tube stop on the 'High Street.' A bank and a currency exchange office are just 1/2 block away as well. The Internet cafe is just a couple of shops away, and the price is only 1 pound per 30 minutes! There are printing facilities at the cafe, or go across the street to the Xerox/film developing shop. Purchase phone cards from the post office, which is also just one block away. These cards have the best rate, by far. Don't bother with the 'America First Gold/Platinum Edition' cards from the tobacco/7-11 shop across the street or the internet cafe two-doors down. You'll get about 30 minutes of international calling time for $10 (5 pounds). The post office card gives you two hours or so. **So...in a nutshell, be VERY cautious when staying at the RNH, and if you frequent the pubs nearby as well. I'm an extremely conscientious traveler (money belt and all), but it can happen to anyone. There are signs on the London Pub, etc.. that warn of thefts.** -Be VERY much on guard in and out of your room -Be prepared to pack your own sheets (harsh soap used) -Bring flip-flops or sandals so you don't have to walk on the dirty floors on the way to the pocket-sized bathrooms -Bring your own coffee or tea -Bring your own alarm clock -Call your own taxis, and don't rely on porters for information -Bring earplugs -Convenient location -Get a new room key every couple of days -Wear a money belt -Hairdryers require 20pound deposit -Non-smoking rooms...ha! :( -BYOW - Bring your own washcloth -Hotel internet is unreliable/phone-card telephones in lobby are in high-demand after 6:00pm I understand that the Tavistock and President's Hotels (also owned by the Imperial Hotels - but are around the corner) are much safer/cleaner.

It was the only hotel that was available in the special BA promotion (a fact that is not made readily known to you until you finish booking the airline ticket - they offer a list of 12 hotels and none were available except this one - but that's BA's fault and not the hotel's fault.) We had booked about 5 months ago (June 2005) for our stay in November 2005. We had requested a cot or crib for our son and had a confirmation that it would be there when we checked in. We checked in around 10 p.m. and were informed by the front desk staff that the housekeeping staff had left for the day and they did not put a cot in the room and no one has a key to the room that has the cots and we would have to contact housekeeping the next day. After letting them know it was not acceptable (and we needed to speak to a manager) they said they would send someone over to remedy the situation. About 20 minutes later two hotel staff members brought a collapsible mattress. We asked for pillows - and they replied \"Oh you need pillows too now eh?\" WTF? Do British hoteliers train in customer service? This was not an unreasonable request. They came back with some pancake thin pillows another 20 minutes later. The rooms are very compact and had two single beds (we put the collapsible bed between the two). There is a desk, two chairs, a TV, lamp, and coffee/tea-maker also. The bathroom is also very tight. A complimentary small bar of soap is provided. You have to ease yourself into the bathroom close the door then make your way to the toilet. The bathtub us rather high (at least according to US standards and very old people or those with disabilities may have a hard time getting in). Towels are provided, although they feel like they have been around since Margaret Thatcher was in office - they are very rough and do a good job of exfoliating your skin. The lobby area of the hotel was filled with 18-24 year old Europeans and British tourists when we checked in. In the evening these people forget they are in a hotel and are very loud - I'm talking playing club music at a very loud volume and making noise in the hallway loud. We had to call the front desk after a group of them keep slamming their doors after 11 p.m. at night. This was after asking them politely not to. I might add that my 2 and half year old was better behaved and had better manners that most of these 18 - 24 year olds. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think most of them grasped the concept of a hotel - they treated it more like a college dormitory - walking around the hallways without shoes and in their pajamas. The highlight was one night when one young girl (20ish) walked around banging on every door on the 3rd floor because she forgot what room she was in - mind you this was past 11 p.m. at night. Breakfast is provided in the mornings (make sure you have your yellow cards that they give you at check-in) and you are treated to cereal, cold toast, and small packets of butter and jam. Coffee and tea is also provided (they are made in huge batches). The wait staff in the dining area is surly. Silverware and plates are scarce at certain times. If you don't show up at least half an hour before breakfast is over (breakfast is served 7 - 10 a.m) you lose out. The wait staff starts breaking down tables and stop making any more food. For an additional few pounds, you can buy a \"hot\" English breakfast. Checkout was easy. Although I question their security. My in-laws who were staying in a different room were running late on the day of check out (they went to pick up a rental car) so my wife and I asked whether we could get their bags out of their room (so that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be charged for late check out) and the front-desk staff made a keycard for us without asking for ID or anything. Other: - There is a safe-deposit box and money exchange place in the lobby next to the elevator. - There seems to be wireless internet access in the building. We saw a 20 something in a t-shirt, and shorts and flip-flops sitting on the floor next to the information desk with her Mac power book plugged unto an electrical outlet and chatting away on instant messenger. - There are 24 hour food shops (sorta like 7-11s in the US) across the street. - The noise from the courtyard travels into the hotel rooms. - The tube stop is only a 5 minute walk away. - There is a Tesco nearby. - There are some nice restaurants and bars about a 15 - 20 minute walk away. We liked Rasa Samudra on 5 Charlotte Street, a great South Indian restaurant. I would give this hotel a 2.75 stars out of 5. It was cheap and clean and great if you use it to sleep for about 8 hours (provided the euro club kids are having a party on your floor).", "Date": "November 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redmond, WA", "Title": "\u201cRoyal Nation \"Disaster\"\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4142219", "Content": "We have just returned from a week's stay in London.

As I was a student I was not able to offer my parents a fancy hotel. The reason for me to choose Royal National is because of its great location, just 2 blocks away from the Russel Square Station. I knew I can't expect too much since its a budget hotel. However, when I checked in, I found that I just started my nightmare...... I made my reservation through a travel agent. By some reason I don't know why my reservation was separated into two bookings handled by two travel agent. The booking still valid, and it seems no problem to the hotel staff at all. They told me the booking was ok and I can keep the same room throughout my visit (I knew that sometime when booking through different source there will be chance that I can't keep the same room even if price are same). However, they told me I have to approach front desk later to do a \"re check-in\" because of the different booking sources. I started feeling stupid because this situation happened to me few times in different hotel before so I quite undersatnd their operation. In other hotel, to avoid keeping me inconvenience, they will do all the registration process at the same time instead of telling me to bring my voucher and register again. One thing I forgot to mention, I had a situaiton that I wasn't really in the hotel during my stay because I went to Northern England and Scotland for few stays and I only need the room to keep my parents luggage. I explained my situation to them and they said they can do nothing for me and I have to approach them or I couldn't keep my room. Therefore I changed my plan in order to complete the stupid \"re check-in\". After I checked in, I went to my room and it just seems ok to me. Outside of the room was a bit noisy because the housekeeping keep knocking their trolley on the wall many times. At least the room was neat and clean. I started unpack my suitcase with my parents. Suddenly I heard someone was opening my door and went in. I found that it was a housekeeper used her master key to go into my room without knocking my door. I was unpleased already by the hospitality at the front desk when I check in and now I felt the housekeeper was really rude to me. It was such an unprofessional attitude that can never happen to a housekeeper. I unpacked my suitcase and I went out for sightseeing and had a very nice dinner with my parents and I went back to the hotel at around 20:45. I had a flight at Gatwick Airport in the early morning to Edinburgh so I needed a cab in the mid night. I was not sure about it so I approached concierge desk and wish they could help me to call a cab ready when I depart the hotel. And the concierge staff told me they were not able to call until 21:00 which means 15 mins later. I asked whether they can help me to call when they could call a cab and they just told me to come again after 9pm. I felt that was so ridiculous to went to the concierge desk again so I just ring the concierge desk after 9pm. This time they just told me there were always cabs just outside of the hotel so they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to make any arrangement. However, when I went down at 4am in the morning, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any taxi at all. I felt very angry this time but I had no time to argue with the hotel staff since I had a flight to catch. If I knew that earlier, I probably checked out and found another hotel. I went to Scotland with my parents for few days and I found a very nice hotel to stay with them, friendly and helpful staff, neat room and good location. We had a lot of fun in Scotland and back to London on a late flight. We went back to the Royal National Hotel, I felt exhausted and just wanted to have a hot shower and went to bed. When I opened the room door, I really gone mad this time because I found that my room was never been make up since I left the hotel. I called to concierge desk and tried to ask them to find someone to clean my room but they told me it was not possible because there were no housekeeper on duty. I really felt very angry but I was very tired. So I made my compromise and just asked for the clean towels. I felt that I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay longer in the hotel and luckily I was checking out the day after. I made my complaint when I check out and I wanted to talk to the manager and express my anger. However they hotel staff \u00e2\u20ac\u0153claimed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the manager wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at the front desk and I could write down my comment and there was nothing they could help me, just like usual. When I went back home, I got their reply after three weeks and the hotel manager insist there was no complaint made by other guest regarding the housekeeping and front desk staff. In the end of the letter, there was not even one word about apologize but insist they are offering a competitive price accommodation at Central London. Is this mean I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t demand more than a bed to sleep with that price???

It seemed many went to left desk, and then to be told to go to the right desk (would have been easier if there was a sign). Signed in and asked to be pay up front, then I was given my card key and the instructions as to find my room i.e. forth floor in the north building, that was my instructions. I went in to my room and was disgusted with the dirty room; you could see the dust everywhere, I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better check our bed and it had dirty sheets. I then went in to the bath room and noticed black hairs everywhere, I called reception and they said it would be cleaned the next day, I demanded the room to be cleaned immediately. After about 30 minutes someone walked in my room to clean, no knock just walked in using his key. Now I had a twin room for my partner and me, what if we were naked!! After the room was cleaned we felt better. When I tired to speak to the staff, either they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand English or just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care to speak (the only English staff was reception I felt). In the morning (around 9am) the cleaning man just tried to enter our room without a knock. Even though we had a please do not disturb sign on the door (we made our own as they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one) he continued to try and enter, luckily we looked the door. He tried to enter many times, and when I finally opened the door he shouted and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I need to clean the room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was so angry at this attitude, I shouted back and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you read the sign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he ignored me and tried to enter my room where my wife was still in bed. Of course I stopped him. The English breakfast was awful, no idea what they tried to serve everyone, the only thing I ate was the toast. I tried the full English but the eggs was horrible and the bacon, well no idea if came from an animal it was more like rubber. The coffee was like water with a little flavour.

The room was clean and so was the bathroom (probably recently refurbished). We were on the first floor facing the main road and it was noisy (I took ear plugs).

English breakfast was buffet style and consisted of cereal, bacon, sausage, beans, tomatoes, eggs (boiled, poached, scrambled) fruit, toast and jams, fruit juice, tea, coffee, hot chocolate. Comments that breakfast was just bread and marmalade are untrue in my opinion as my daughter chose the continental breakfast - toast, bread rolls, cereals, jam and fruit juice (not great but not just bread and jam).

We had room 7054 and although it couldn't have been farther from the lift, we found the room to be quite comfortable and large even by American standards. Fortunately, a map of the rooms shows this to be one of the largest rooms on each level! The room was very clean and not shabby in the least. We planned to spend very little time in our room but my husband got the flu and spent 1.5 days there! He had no complaints! My teenage daughters didn't complain once about breakfast. Our favorite part was its proximity to the Russell Square Tube station thus making siteseeing extremely convenient. Being so close to a stop on the Piccadilly line, makes travel to Heathrow very convenient and affordable! We will certainly be back as it offered everything that we could need or want at a resonable price--No small feat in London!", "Date": "March 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, England", "Title": "\u201cFair for the money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3256944", "Content": "I stayed here for 1 night in February, and although it is clearly not the best hotel in London, I didn't think it was all that bad for a 3* budget hotel.

The queue to check in was pretty long when we arrived at 2pm due to the fact that a couple of bus loads of students had just arrived, and this queue was only marginally shorter when we returned at 10:30pm. But you have to take into consideration that this is a massive hotel and is obviously extremely popular with student and group trips as it is so cheap. Breakfast was included with our stay and there was a good wide choice of cooked food, cereals and fruits. My only real complaint would be that there was no hair-drier in the room and although you could hire one from housekeeping, you had to pay a \u00c2\u00a320 deposit, which I thought was a bit steep!

They have FREE luggage storage if you are checking-IN, and my advice is to simply store your baggage there, and come back as late as you can. There is a two pound fee for storing your bags on check OUT, but all in all, it is a pretty reasonable service. The rooms: I arranged my rooms through a travel company back in Toronto. They were average rooms. A single traveller, I rec'd a room with 2 single beds--always nice. The room was clean, roomy, and the washroom was clean as well. When the battery failed in my remote for the TV, someone came up within a few minutes after I spoke to housekeeping. A word to the wise however: The rooms facing the streets can be VERY noisy. If you are not used to sleeping in an urban environment ( cars driving, sirens, people chatting, etc), request a room INSIDE. As I AM used to that kind of environment, the noise was just like at home, and posed no problems. I did not partake in the continental breakfast so I can't comment on that. The hotel is a 3 minute walk from Russell Square Underground Stn, which itself is on the same subway line to Heathrow Airport. By taxi, it is UNDER 10 pounds to Paddington Station--where you can get an express to Heathrow Airport. So, location-wise, it is very convenient.

It seems like most people writing the bad reviews are just too spoiled and dont realise how lucky they are to find a hotel with a price of 85 pounds for a double room . London is one of my favourite destinations and I have stayed in Royal National hotel 3 times. I must say people who are traveling to London have to start preparing themselves for a shock upon arriving to London hotels . Most of the smaller/budget hotels have tiny rooms , outdated design and sometimes lacks facilities that seem to many to be neccesary in an hotel room . A lot of those hotels are operating for a very lond time and are not refurbished very often. So its not just the Royal National Hotel that seems to be a bit dodgy from time to time (for instance try to find a hotel room for 50 pounds for a double room per night... Im pretty sure if you feel the RNH is lacking facilities/services/basic hotel feature and whatever, you will be very shocked of the outcome) I have to say that although the prices for this budget hotel are quite high , it is one of the most valuable hotels in London and here are the reasons : The hotel is very centrally located , I rarely used the Russel Square tube station but instead preferd to take long walks in the days I was visiting the city center. Getting to Tottenham court road, Covent Garden , The Soho and Oxford street took less then 20 minutes of walking . Also the A1 bus from Heathrow airport stops at the entrance to the hotel . The neighbourhood itself is very nice and safe , especially because there are other big hotels around the square so you can see people and tourists walking around almost all hours of the day. Also there are plenty of grocery stores and resturants in the area . As for the hotel itself : Dont be intimidated by the size of it , it looks like a big old office building but the inside of the hotel is quite OK , for a budget hotel . The reception area is usually crowded at hours of check in and check out times because there are more than 800 rooms in this hotel . The staff is quite friendly and helpful , although sometimes find it hard to cater for 100 people who try to check in at one time . After all the service by the staff is quite ok , i've seen worst in other hotels which are smaller and more expensive. The rooms are seperated into two areas, the older and the newer . I dont think there is a difference in price for the rooms I guess its just a matter of luck so i'm not sure asking for a room upgrade will help. The newer are rooms have electronice keys, you can see they have been renovated but there isnt much difference between the old and the new rooms. I have stayed in both sections of the hotel and apart from the old 70's looking design in the older section I couldnt find much difference. Every room has a kettle and sachets of coffee tea and milk powder. Dont expect anymore than that cause there are a lot of London hotels that wouldnt offer even this. Also the rooms i've stayed in were quite standard in size , clean , with all the basic facilities you need when you stay in London (as there is no reason to come to London if you are planning to spend your whole days in an hotel) . A few other details you should know. There used to be a breakfast service on every floor the last few times i have been there. So it save the hassle of running down to the crowded breakfast room. Just ask the receptionists about this. The breakfast service on the floor offers almost the same as you would get in the breakfast room. So after reading all the reviews about dirty, stinky, badly decorated , small rooms , bad service etc etc . I have to say from my three experiences in this hotel is that its all pretty good for the price you pay ! You would hardly get more than that in central London hotels for this price (did i happend to mention the hotels with shared bathrooms/toilets ?) . And one last thing , if you come to London and stay in this hotel and very unhappy about it , at least try to enjoy yourself and realise that you are very lucky to stay in a centrally located hotel that offers you almost all of London by walking distance.

However, my most recent visits indeed proved me wrong. I have stayed in the Royal National twice, both stays were for two nights or more. And I had an excellent stay. In fact I have been very surprised to read about the bad stories of this hotel. I can only presume they come from people who like complaining. Fair enough, this isn't a luxury hotel by any means, but you'd have to pay a lot more money if that's what your looking for in London. London is an expensive city, and the hotel is actually great value for London prices. The hotel is apparently one of the largest in central London, and I found staff to be very friendly and helpful. The reception area does look rather kitsch, with the souvineer shops and patterned carpets, and there may be a faint smell of smoke since the hotel bar is situated round the corner, but hey, welcome to London! I found the rooms and bathrooms to be clean and well fitted with all the basics you need. The TV has satellite and radio, and the beds are made everyday, and new packets of coffee and tea are put out for you. I have stayed in various hotels all over Europe with my family as a child, and not being the richest of people, we've never stayed in luxury hotels, just somewhere clean with the basics. And to be honest, that's all you want when you go to London. Unless you want to sit in your room watching TV all day! London is an amazing city, and the Royal National is situated so as to gain easy access to all of it. I viewed the hotel as a great stopping point, since all day and some of the night I was out enjoying the bustling London life! Also, there are numerous shops and restaurants surrounding the hotel. One Thai restaurant down the street, a few Italians. And plenty of grocery shops for picking up essentials. The restaurants are pretty reasonable in price. Go to Covent Garden for more variety though, and if you want to spend a bit more money on something nice. I reccommend the Rock Garden restaurant, a bit pricey but beautiful food and cocktails! So all in all, the Royal National would be my choice of hotel to stay in London. Breakfast is suffice, unless you'd like to pay a few pounds extra for a hot Full English (very nice, especially if you've been enjoying London's nightlife the night before)! The bar is open until 1am, which is great if you don't want to go out, or perhaps want a drink there before you go out. Also, many nationalities of people stay there. We met a lovely group of Australians, and are still in touch. So I think all these bad reviews are perhaps from people who are stuck up, and thought that \u00c2\u00a385 would buy them a room complete with butler and jacuzzi. Not in London I'm afraid!

Upon arrival on March 13th and prior to returning to Canada on March 20th. The first time, we were supposed to stay for 2 nights. Prior to arrival, after reading out loud all the horrendous critiques by guests staying there before us, I had this ah so sinking feeling and luckily, was able to reduce our stay for 1 night each time - to spend one more day on the beach in sunny, hot Southern Portugal... Where do I begin: for the record, I dislike people whiningabout everything. We, spoiled North Americans, are great at that. Nevertheless, I, as someone who travelled the East Block extensively, must state: this hotel is a close runner-up to some of the worst I had the dubious pleasure staying at in Moscow, Russia during the heyday of perestroyka. In the lobby, stink, smoke galore. The room we stayed at - ditto. Bathroom, very clean and updated, though. However, one cannot help thinking, the rooms must have served as office rooms before. My take, the whole building may have been a government building at one time (Perhaps, Ministry of War?). Our room's floor was so dirty and unvacumed that I did not step on it without my shoes. The endless corridors - rather labyrinths - are so confusing that, in the case of a fire, God save all within its premises. A double room retails 85 Pounds (a mere 200 Canadian $). An outrage, I say. Luckily, by booking via BA we only paid CDN $ 118 - a great deal less. As to location, indeed, it's great - if the weather would not have been as miserable as it was - both times - upon arrival/departure from London. Yes, it is an exciting city, great culture, civilized people - once you understand their accent - and vice versa... However, it is sooooo overrated. Upon checking in the second time, we arrived at the hotel just before midnight. The next morning we asked if we could check out one hour past the obligatory 11 AM (!!!???) check-out time? The answer was brief: nyet (NO). Long live Portugal, where CDN $ 2 buys you a litre (!!!) of very good Vino Verde. In London Town? You pay 91 Pounds (CDN$ 225) to get from downtown to the airport via cab - due to trains regularly breaking down/being serviced - with no alternative offered to stranded passengers. But, as Monsieur Kippling used to say, that is an entirely another story - shall we?My fellow Canadians, I say, thank God for Canada!!! We are so spoiled!! Go, visit London!! You'll see... Have a pleasant stay!HJB Vancouver, British Columbia CanadaP.S. My partner and I, both fairly educated people, wonder: why is that that the British pound is much stronger than the US $ - or, 2.5 times stronger than the Canadian currency? We've seen no evidence of British superiority - when it comes to infrastructure or quality of life. Nothing close to what we are used to here in Canada. Please, don't you come and quote me culture and theatre now - there is only that much I can take. After that, I may need to take a cab - which cost me 12 pounds (30 CDN $) for a 10 minutes ride from the hotel to London Liverpool Street Station.
