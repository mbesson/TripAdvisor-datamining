We arrived earlier than our check in time. They said it was not problem. The staff offered us cappicinos and snacks while we waited, even offered to hold our luggage in a locked room for us if we wanted to go around Rome. The room was ready for us in 30 minutes. In that 30 mintures the man at the front desk gave us a map of Rome- we told him the sights we wanted to see. He gave us estimated time it would take to get the locations, how long he thought the wait we would be on lines, and told us the better places to see at night. Everytime we came in, the staff greeted us with the friendliest smile. Every moring breakfast was prepared and the staff made sure everything was going great for our visit.

We were really grateful! I liked the breakfast area, quite cute and it was nice to speak to other travellers over breakfast, it has a nice relaxed atmosphere. I also liked the fact that our room had a balcony, it had a little lemon tree on it which was lovely, I liked having somewhere in my room to watch the busy, roman world go by! The rooms were clean if a little drab, I mean, the decor was nice but there were a few scuff marks on the wall and the grouting around the bottom of the shower was a bit mildewy - however it was clean, and the daily cleaning service was good. Bed was also comfortable with nice clean sheets. To be fair, this hotel is pretty good value for a really good location, close to all parts of Rome, we walked to pretty mutch everything apart from the Vatican... Although a little tip - bring comfy shoes as walking everywhere is pretty knackering!!! I would definately reccomend this hotel, I think if you are going to do Rome properly, number 1 in your choice of hotel is the location. How long are you going to be spending in your room anyway?! You also have to be realistic with what you expect for what price, and I would always go for friendly staff and cleanliness and over look things like scuff marks on a wall!", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cGood location and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Lady_A_J", "ReviewID": "UR125582802", "Content": "The Hotel is set on the first floor of an old building.

If your visiting from the US the accomodations of some of the rooms may be a bit small, but still very nice. We stayed in a different room upon return from the cruise which had a large bathroom almost as big as the room with a window. I think it was room 24. The showers are fairly small by American standards which is common in most hotels. Also common among hotels in Italy is they do not use or provide washcloths. The beds are also somewhat hard not pillowtops for sure. We were so tired most of the time we did not notice. Keep in mind that there is no elevator and its a couple flights of stairs to the rooms. The staff was more than willing to assist but its usually just one staff member there at any given time as the hotel only has 13 rooms. Rooms facing the street side can be somewhat noisy but not a real problem. There is a nice balcony and courtyard area sometimes roped off but the small balcony is part of the hotel and access is always available. Breakfast is great coffee with a roll and crossiant. Corn flakes and granola are avilable as well. There is a small coffee bar/snack shop just two doors down from the hotel and a pizza place across the street. We loved the location not more than a short walk to everything, Its perhaps a 15 min walk to Vatican and Trevi is about 7 min. Rome has lots of steps and you can get turned around with all the little streets so carry a map. The staff was wonderful and very accomodating. Tiger, Mostafa and my apologies I cant remember one name, these guys were the absolute best. Very helpful and went above and beyond.

My mother, sister and I spent 4 days and nights in Rome. It was our first stop in Italy and we were excited to finally visit this magnificent city. I came somewhat prepared (Rick Steves' Italy guide with me) but there is nothing like the first official culture shock when you first land in a new place. We arrived via taxi from the Airport to Hotel Giardino and were immediately impressed. The location is simply amazing! Walking distance to all the central attractions (The Colosseum, the Spanish Steps and so on). We were able to walk to all the places we wanted to see and were only 10min from the Termini Train station. When we didn't want to walk, we took the bus across the street from the Hotel (Via Nazionale). The Roma Pass was a great help. As soon as we arrived to the hotel, we were greeted by Tigar, who was working the day shifts. He was so accommodating and helpful, that is wasn't long before we all became good friends. He not only made our stay pleasant every single day, he want out of his way to insure we had the right directions on the map and the locations of the bus stations and the bus number, not to mention marking the route and where to get off. He made sure to book for us the tickets for the Vatican in advance and schedule an appointment for us at the Galleria Borghese. He advised on the top 10 local lunch/dinner restaurants and Gelato spots and they were all on the money. And all this with a constant smile and great attitude, even when we asked him on a daily basis to go to the trouble of giving us more suggestions and to take out our personals from their safety box and back again. Truly a wonderful Italian hospitality! The rest of the staff was just as wonderful and accommodating. The rooms are a good size, but not big. we stayed at a room with 2 beds (plus additional folded bed for my sister, who only stayed for 3 days) and a bathroom/shower. It was a bit crowded with the extra bed, but still comfortable. It's not too fancy, but has the beautiful classic simplicity of Italian hotels. Beautiful, charming, clean. Since we spent 80% of the time outside our hotel room - all that mattered is that we have a safe, quiet, peaceful, clean place to sleep in and that was close to everything. Breakfast, which is included, was nice as well. Continental, not fancy, with some fresh bread, cereal, cheese, jam, the usual basic and of course coffee per order. We never left hungry. Yes, it was off season, but the price was just amazing for 4 nights, 3 people. we paid 420.00 Euros. Trust me, you can't beat this value...I checked!

Then, there is Hotel Giardino. Stepping into your room, you will be transported back to 1970 to a time where the thick veneer of moustache and pragmatism might have been able to gloss over the flaws. But 40 years on, and with not a paint job since, this may not be the kind of time travel you were hoping for during your stay in Roma. The yellow walls carry every knock, scrape or bump since time immemorial. The bed is a slab of old tuna covered in the gills of old men. The bidet (where some choose to wash their backside) is where you will find your clean towels in the morning; you'll need to be at your humorous best to stomach that little idiosyncracy. The lights are dim. The bed coverings appear to be old curtains and the curtains, ironically, old bedsheets. There is aircon (sometimes), the TV is modern, and the bathroom only a little dank, but there is no safe (you have to hand over you room key to reception every time you leave the hotel) and no bar fridge to cool your water from the fountains. So why stay here? The location is fantastic. Just seconds from Quirinale Hill (the Presidential Palace, the best sunset in Rome and two of its finest Churches - think Bernini and Borromini) and possibly the best seafood you will eat (Corte del Grillo). The Trevi is no more than a 5 minute walk, the Colosseum, Wedding Cake, Pantheon, Santa Maria della Vittoria all within 10-15 minutes, Piazza Navona 20 and St Peters Square 40. We didnt need a cab once during our stay, nor a bus or train. The 24 hour service is also good, but dont expect any privacy. The breakfast, however, is well below average. The pastries are yesterday's and the powdered orange juice is a memory fit only for school camp. No free wi-fi. Relative to other hotels in Rome, Hotel Giardino seems inexpensive, but we immediately regretted our decision to skimp and would look elsewhere on any future stay; even though we spent very little time in the room, it was an unpleasant retreat whenever we did return.

There are so many vastly overpriced places to stay in Rome (as with any major city I suppose) so it's good to know it IS possible to find somewhere to stay that is central, comfortable, clean and doesn't break the bank! Giardino is fantastically located - within walking distance of most of Rome's attractions. The hotel itself is up one flight of stairs on the first floor of the building. Reception is open 24 hours. I have to say, we barely spoke to the staff as we were eager to get out and explore but the guy on reception during our stay was friendly and did offer us help planning our sight-seeing. My boyfriend knows Rome pretty well so we didn't need to take him up on his offer but it was good to know the local knowledge was there if we needed it. Considering our room was one of those coming off the breakfast room, I don't recall much noise at all. Breakfast was a simple continental with bread, cereal, croissants, tea, coffee and fruit juice all on offer. The room was comfortable and clean. The bed was a decent size and the room was actually bigger than I expected having read some of the other reviews here mention small rooms. The bathroom was a bit worn. Nothing major wrong but the shower door didn't close properly which resulted in a small pool of water collecting on the bathroom floor outside the shower each time it was used.

During our 11 night stay, Mostafa and Tiger were so helpful in getting around the city and seeing the sites. Florina took such wonderful care of us. She was the first person we saw most mornings at breakfast and was sweet and caring. Jahanger, the overnight young man was literally a life saver. I woke at about 4am during our stay violently ill and knew I needed to go a hospital fast. My husband went to the lobby and Jahanger called me transportation, assisted me to the waiting taxi (I didn't want an ambulance since I thought the siren noise would kill me). He provided the taxi with the info to what we needed and expressed the need to get me there quickly. In about 7 hours when I returned back from the hospital, the rest of the staff was so caring and wonderful, inquiring about how I was feeling and if I needed anything. I cannot say enough good things about the 4 primary staff members we dealt with (Mostafa, Tiger, Florina and Jahanger).

The hotel is rated two stars and have rather small simple rooms with ensuite bathrooms (shower) but we had cleaning every day with new towels. We had a room towards the courtyard and it was quiet and clean. The breakfast was served by the host every day and included youghurt, tea/coffee (espresso, capuccino available), orange juice, a croissant and a bagel, sufficient for us. One night we had bought some wine and cheese and when we asked for a wineopener we got a whole tray with plates, wine glasses etc - good service! The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful and very well familiar with the places worth to see in Rome and how to get there. Don't hesitate to ask! They also provide printer service and help you to book tickets, taxi and so on. Thanks to Tiger in the reception for all help and inside tips! Our tips in Rome: 1. A very nice restaurant just nearby Fontana di Trevi called Spiriti e Forme (Vicolo Scavolino 63) where we were served the best meal on our stay. Good prices, nice staff and excellent food and wine. 2. Book your tickets to the Vatican in advance otherwise you might be stuck in line for several hours. Take a break between the Sistine Chapel and the Basilica of Saint Peters and go to a nearby restaurant (about 5 min) called the Passaguai (via Pomponio Leto 10). High quality food! We had some great wine and ch\u00e9vre there. 3. If you want to take a peaceful walk, visit the Aventines and take a look in the Aventine keyhole and see Saint Peters far away. Nice quiet neighbourhood (at least in March...) with surrounding orange trees and nice view over Trastevere (Piazza dei Cavalieri di Malta). 4. Do not go to Porta Portese market. Highly overrated. 5.

Rather than lock me into a reservation, they allowed me to play it by ear until I could get a flight home. They even accomodated a fellow stranded traveler from my hometown. I can not speak highly enough about them... Location - The location, right off of via Nazionale is only a short walk from pretty much everything. The Colloseum is about a 10 minute walk, the Forum about the same. Plenty of resraurants around on Via Serpenti, Via Boschetto and Via Cavour. Just outside of Hotel Giardino is a small coffee shop with food and more importantly - Caffe Irlandese. The hotel is also easily acessible from the Metro (Cavour or Republicca).

A nice feature about this hotel is they have a collection of Rome/Italy guide books that other travelers have left behind that you can use if you didn't bring your own. This hotel is a Rick Steeves recommendation which is evident in the fact that at every table in the breakfast room an American traveler was clutching one of his books. Our room was pretty quiet. The bed wasn't very comfortable, I could feel each of the springs digging into my back. The toilet was constantly running and the bathroom needed a good cleaning with mildew remover and CLR. The shower changed water pressure and temperature to drastic (and dangerous) extremes during a ten minute shower which was a complaint we heard from other travelers in the breakfast room.

I'm very glad we stayed at Hotel Giardino. The service was excellent. The hotel is more like a bed and breakfast. The front desk had someone on duty at all times. You leave your key with them when you leave your room. It was like having a concierge. Because none of my family spoke Italian nor had friends in Rome, we were vulnerable tourists. I felt like the staff at Giarduno helped keep us from being taken advantage of as tourists. The Hotel staff gave us restaurant recommendations, suggestions on how to tour the city, what to see, why to see it, and even ordered limo service for us to the boat and to the airport after our return on the cruise at half the cost of the cruise-line. They hire very nice people to staff their front desk. The hotel is nice and clean, but the rooms are quite small--but sweet. I looked forward to their tasty, light breakfast each morning. They had Rome travel books in their library so don't pack yours! There was a TV in the common area where they were fine with our watching the news in English. They even heated up my leftovers, and usually had cokes and beers on hand when we were tired from touring. The downside is that there is no elevator so be prepared to haul your bags up lots of stairs. The place is within walking distance to Trevi fountain, the Coloseum, and I think we even walked back to our room from the Spanish steps. We hopped the bus to the Vatican at a bus-stop right out front of the hotel. The hotel's location is excellent. We had to rent two rooms so it was a bit pricier for our family, but we were glad we had the two rooms once we saw how small the rooms were.

We stayed four nights at the Hotel Giardino and I am so glad we did. You can't beat the location. We walked to most every location we were interested in seeing such as the Trevi Fountain, Colliseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, and the Spanish steps. Easy to reach the metro or the bus as well for farther places like the Vatican or Villa Borghese. And I always felt safe, especially noting that the police station is just around the block!! The rooms were very quiet for sleeping, especially for a busy city like Rome. The double paned windows keep out all the noise, and I am a light sleeper. During the day we sometimes kept them open to just hear the hustle and bustle of the city, but at night, the air-conditioning went on and the windows were closed. The best part of the hotel though is the staff. The guys were always available especially for the myriad questions we had and requests for tea, hot chocolate, cappucino!! They were always ready with a map to show directions, advice with restaurants they enjoyed , or where the local laundry facility was. They even got on the phone for us to help interpret with Italian relatives we were to meet but neither my husband nor I speak Italian!! You just have to remember that, as the hotel web site states, you have to walk up a flight of stairs to the hotel and the rooms are moderate to small in size. And the showers are not meant for large people. Those are the only things that I would point out as possible down sides for some people. But I enjoyed it. Otherwise, I could have just traveled locally if I wanted a plush hotel with amenities. And the web site photos look just the same in person, cute little balcony and breakfast room with plenty of croissants, rolls, cereal, cappucino, yogurt, tea- just enough to get the day going.

His positives about the hotel are right on the money: cost, location, and friendy staff. For Rome, the cost is extremely affordable. Location was central \u2013 we walked everywhere. And the two gentlemen we dealt with over our two-night stay were exceptionally helpful and friendly. There were none of the fears we experienced at other hotels about leaving our belongings in the room or getting ripped off by a shifty checkout person. However, this is still a 3-star hotel in Rome (very different from 3-star hotel in, say, Florence). Know that you are getting what you pay for. The showers were not as clean as one might expect \u2013 my wife refused to take a shower. One side of our towel rack was broken and hung down from the wall. Tiles were cracked. In fact, I felt like I was in a public washroom. Within the room itself, the walls were scuffed. Rugs were ragged and filthy. And it was the only hotel of all our hotels in Italy that did not have International CNN \u2013 not normally a factor except that there was such scant light in each of our two rooms (we switched after the first night thinking we had drawn the dungeon room) that it was near impossible to read a book or crib in our journals. We would recommend this place for those folks who are most concerned about those strengths outlined above. This is most definitely a budget hotel. Additionally, if you are a Rick Steves-type traveller, you will find more of your kind here. We took in the free breakfast on our first morning and sat in a side room about the size of a mini-van in which two couples from the American Midwest traded Vatican-visiting tips in voices far too loud for 8 a.m. (we could even hear them from our hotel room!). I exaggerate for effect since they were otherwise decent people -- perhaps just a little too enthusiastic for me. If you are an enthusiastic budget traveller, then the Hotel Giardino is for you.

The air conditioning worked fine but I suspect it's only available after June 1. In late may you may wish you had a fan with you. Our little group took three rooms and nobody had any complaints.

They made excellent area restaurant recommendations and were always happy to call us with a taxi when we needed one. TV in the rooms had no English language channels, but they had BBC World News always playing in the lounge. The place was small enough that the staff and even other guests got to know us.

Once we got off the train in Rome, we found our way very easily to Hotel Giardino with the great directions that were provided. We stayed in two different rooms at this hotel. My sister and her boyfriend stayed in a charming interior room that had a terrace with a table outside! I stayed in a room facing the street....it was very comfortable and the bathroom was HUGE. The shower itself was small, but it is like that most hotels in Italy so it didn't bother us at all. Although our room faced the street, the windows had fabulous double panes and at night we were not disturbed at all. The beds were firm, but comfortable and there was lots of extra pillows and bedding in the closet should you need it. Also, everything was impeccably CLEAN. I am a clean/neat freak and our room met my high standards. Prior to our stay, we had great email communication with the staff and I really want to thank them for answering our many questions. Not only were they prompt and clear in all of their responses (in English), but they were also able to advise us on other portions of our Italian vacation (for example, Katie gave me great advice on purchasing train tickets). Once we got to the hotel, we were able to check in early....before noon! (Thanks Giovanni!) That was a great relief as we had been traveling for quite a while and wanted to freshen up before we hit the sites. The breakfast was so good in the morning. It was served in a delightful little breakfast room with decorative plates on the wall. You could also eat outside on a lovely terrace if you wanted too. Breakfast was yogurt, cereal, some breads, a delicious juice (my boyfriend could not get enough of this) along with a variety of jams and spreads. You also got cappuccino, tea, or hot chocolate. I found the breakfast to be completely sufficient to begin our day. What I enjoyed the most about this hotel was the people and the level of comfort. There is a 24 hour reception so there was always someone to greet you when you came in, and the staff was incredibly friendly and considerate. They were so amiable and we had a lot of great conversations with them. We discussed how awesome Rick Steves was with Katie (he was there when we were there!!!) and we talked about the best place to purchase Nikes online with Giovanni.

So starting off with all the points: Location: Is great central location. It is 10 minutes to the Collesum, 15 mins to the Trevi fountain and 20 mins to the spanish steps, 30 minutes to the Vatican city. Hotel: Very friendly atmosphere everyone very helpful. A very traditional Bed and Breakfast feel to the place. About 30 rooms Room: The rooms are quite small, clean none the less! We had a double bed. The bathroom is very small you can only fit one person in there at a time. But very clean. Breakfast: The breakfast room as 4 tables in it and also use of the courtyard with tables and chairs in the good weather periods. The breakfast there is cornflakes or museli, a crossiant and roll with a selection of jams,spreads,butter ect....... Tea,coffee,orange juice,hot chocolate. Sights: As it is a great central location then it is easy to walk tho everything. Your legs will be tired by the end of the day though! The entrance tickets are very cheap. 12 euros to get into the Colessum,Phatheon,Acient Ruins. Basilica is free and the sistin chapel is 12 Euros. You can aslo has guided tours which are about 40 Euros per attraction. Trains: We got the train from FCO Airport to the centre which took 30 minutes and cost 11Euros each one way a taxi will cost 30-40 Euros per way. When we got to the centre of Rome we walked to the hotel this took 25minutes. Make sure you get a map before you go! On the way back we got a bus to the train station which you can buy a bus ticket at the hotel which is 1 Euro per person. This took 5 minutes as the bus stop is just across the road. Just get on any that say Staion which is usually the n.o 64 Restraunts: There is so much choice! We asked katie at the hotel to recommend some that were not too expensive she marked them on our map for us. And we also had a wonder during the day we found this great one near the Colessum called Wanted we ate in there both nights Pizzas are great and must have the home made apple pie and home made chocolate mousse delicious!!!! The food here on a average 2 course meal with a drink total 40 Euros. You have to try a ice cream from the ice cream parlours there are 25 different choices of flavours, 5 different types of cones and you only pay 4 Euros for 3 scoops in a cone!

The biggest reason to stay there is because of its excellent location. I organized my review into key points so that you can go directly to the topic that you are most interested in. Price: After the already lower off season rates & Rick Steve's \"Rome 2009\" guidebook discount, we paid $135/ 90 Euro per night. for a double with a private bathroom, phone in room, exterior window view, and breakfast. Great price compared to comparable rooms. Making Reservations: I read about this place in Rick Steve's \"Rome 2009\" guidebook, which lists the contact info, but all the current info is listed on the hotel's website, as well. Reservations were easy to make. I just emailed the hotel and secured the reservation that way. You can also contact them via phone. The responses and emails were replied to in a prompt and courteous manner, especially considering that most places, including restaurants and other hotels were not even close to sending same-day responses via email. Everyone spoke English, which made everything much easier. Location: This was the best quality of the hotel. The Colosseum, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and several other monuments, are within a ten minute walk. There are also lots of cafes, gelaterias, restaurants and tabaccharias on the way to those things, so it's not as though you would have a dead, boring walk to those things. Bus stop is right around the corner. There are several routes that go through that stop, so a Roma Pass would be good if you plan to stay at the hotel at least three days and don't want to walk. Room Details: Spotlessly clean, firm odorless mattress without lumps, tv with Italian channels, and a very large bathroom (considering typical European bathrooms) with a large enough garden shower that it could probably fit a 250 pound woman or a 6.5 foot tall man, phone in room, view of the street with a window that completely cut exterior noise, plenty of towels (thin Euro style linen ones), provided extra pillows upon request, surprsingly quiet room by the main desk, no bathtub. Not sure that this room would be big enough for a family with toddlers/walking-aged children, but it was just the right size for us. Service: Excellent. Surprisingly excellent considering its size and that a lot of two star hotels don't seem to care much about friendly service. The room service cleaned after we left, replaced towels and soap each day. We didn't need too much assistance with arranging rides to the airport, but another couple told us that the employees called the shuttle service for them and arranged it. They told us about great local places to eat that weren't packed with tourists and the food was wonderful. Extras: Not sure if they have wifi. They do not have a public computer or business area, but they let us use their computer to check the status of our flight. Breakfast was good; we were offered a croissant and large roll, coffee/ tea/ espresso, juice, yogurt, cereal and crackers, plus Nutella/ cheese/ pate spread/ etc. No one stole anything or messed with our stuff, but then again I didn't bring any valuables besides the camera.

Back then, I was a newbie reviewer and posted one on Rick Steve's Graffiti Wall. But I thought it's about time more people appreciate this place if it's not overbooked already. We stayed at this pensione for 7 nights in February 2005 and got a great rate of US$80-something/night. What a bargain for Rome, even in the off season. This is one lodging which I happily found to look better in person than in pictures...how often does that happen? Almost never! Although this room -206-was small (there is an amoire and a large, comfy oversized loungy chair- wonderfully relaxing after a day of roaming around), it has a balcony and was very rustically charming with squeaky clean hardwood floors. The reception area is modest and doesn't boast much upon entry, but the rooms are more warm and welcoming. The views to the church across the street, and from the balcony, down either side of the street remind you that you're in ROME. There is quite a bit of traffic along this street but you would never know it once you close the triple? :) glazed window. All the noise fades away and your room becomes this oasis. Aaaahh....The church bells across the street are at the perfect volume with windows closed, sounding more like they are ringing from a few streets away. In fact, it was quiet enough for a mid-day nap every day ;)...gotta keep up with those Roman night-owls. The beds and linens are are very comfortable. At the time we stayed, it seemed like they'd been replaced not too long ago as they were more comfy than the pictures looked. So this place does a good job of replacing older linens I think. But as with other hotels in Italy, they had very spartan waffle textured towels which are comparable to dishtowels found at chain kitchen stores which I won't name as I don't believe in free advertising for them; at least they were not the linen napkin kind that hotels had in Venice that didn't soak up anything. An Old World thing perhaps? The bathroom was very clean albeit on the smaller side. Heavier than average people would have not been comfortable in the shower. Maybe other rooms have bigger showers than the corner ones? The housekeeping person works so hard but was beyond appreciative when we left her a 10Euro tip for our entire stay. That doesn't break down to much per person per day. In the US, if they don't feel you've tipped them enough, they clean out the mini-bar and it gets charged to your room. Incredulous. The breakfast was good but not gourmet by any means. Having Tang for breakfast was something I hadn't experienced since I was a child in the 70s. A little nostalgia is good for the soul I guess :). It was very cold when we were there and the one day they had time to warm our baguette in the oven made the breakfast SO much better than other days when they didn't as the baguette was hard. But since the dining room was overseen mostly by 1 person, we didn't want to over-burden her. But coffeee was made to order and warmed us up nicely to brave the chill outside. On warmer days, you can choose to have breakfast on the quaint terrace in the back. Very tranquil. The hotel is a stone's throw away from Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon, most of the Piazzas, and all the eateries and gelaterias you could possibly want. We walked every where. But the older travelers may prefer transport to say, the Vatican or the Colosseum. Be sure to head to the Forum and Colosseum early - before the tour buses encroach upon the area. If these two places are not opened yet, head up/across the street to Palatine Hill first to make use of time. It's so peaceful to ponder ancient Rome when you have the place almost to yourselves. And when the buses come, you can escape to a nice cafe near the Trajan Market and watch the local cats. This pensione is well run by Katie, a Brit ex-pat who's spent more than 1/2 her life in Italy, so she practically Italian as she is married to one. Katie is a wealth of knowledge, and will graciously help you plan your day.

It was also our cheapest at 110 Euros a night. As for the positives, the price is great and the staff were all very friendly. When we contacted the hotel for booking, they told us that there only available room was their smallest (which is why the price was so low). So, I am not going to complain about the room size as I knew it would be small. The negatives that I am going to mention are the cleanliness, general state of repair, breakfast, noise, and location. The cleanliness wasn't terrible. I wouldn't call the room dirty, but I definitely wouldn't call it clean. Our shower had obvious mold and leaked terribly (hence why they had a mold problem). If the windows were shut all day, the room definitely had a mold/mildew smell. I think the room was cleaned adequately day to day, but I don't think it had a real intensive scrubbing in a long time. The general state of repair was actually probably my biggest problem with our room. Again, the shower was basically falling apart. It was the tiny stall shower that we had all over Italy, but the plastic shelf was completely broken and just dangling there leaving no where to place for your shampoo or soap which wouldn't be a problem if the stall wasn't a telephone booth! My husband I are not big people at all, but we found it very uncomfortable and awkward to try to get to our toiletries and we won't even mention me attempting to shave my legs! Also, in the shower, the shower head was one of the detachable ones which had obviously broken at some point and had been replaced. However, they hadn't replaced the mounted piece which holds it up so it sort of precariously rested on the mount in one position and on multiple occasions fell. Sometimes it just sprayed the ceiling, but other times it landed on our heads! I guess the point of this description is that I felt like they didn't care about their guests' comfort. If they had to shower in that shower, they certainly would have made the necessary repairs, but I felt like since I was in the little room (the budget room), my comfort wasn't a priority. The whole shower experience really soured my mood on this hotel. The breakfast was fine, it just wasn't what we had at other our other 6 hotels and the room was tiny and made conversation awkward. Again, it was adequate just not up to par with some of our other hotels (and we were on a budget ... we spent no more than 150 Euros on a room). The noise was only a problem at night. Italy in May = no A/C so you need to open the window, but when your room overlooks a busy street it isn't really practical to sleep with your window open. And finally, the location which again wasn't terrible, but wasn't great. It was very close to a lot of sites which were great, but it wasn't near any good restaraunts or the metro. I think I would have preferred to be a little closer to one of the major sites which would have had more access to shopping, dining, and transportation. Overall, as my title states, this hotel was OK. I wouldn't say it was terrible, and I wouldn't caution against staying here categorically. I would simply recommend doing your research and price comparisons before settling on this hotel.", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience at the Hotel Giardino\u201d", "Author": "ShannonK1", "ReviewID": "UR15170993", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Giardino in October 2007 (sorry for the belated review) and had a wonderful experience.

This worried me, as I have read other reviewers comments about it being loud. But we decided to brave it and it wasn't so bad. My husband said he heard the night deskman pacing once and we did hear the clanking of dishes in the morning when it was time to get up. Mostly we were so exhausted that we heard nothing until we awoke each morning. We did hear conversation and the TV when we can back for an afternoon nap, but that was easily drowned out by our own TV. Our room was good size with a queen bed, chair, console table, small suspended TV, wardrobe and private bathroom. There was plenty of room for us to walk around, even with our suitcases on the floor. The air conditioner worked great! The room wasn't too stuffy without it as we turned the it off each day when we left and back on upon our return at night. The bathroom was long and narrow with a stand-up shower only. The water pressure was in the low to medium range. There was only one occassion when it wasn't very warm and probably a peak shower time. The only complaint would be that the water changed temperature during the shower. It would go colder, then the set temp, then hotter...this happend a few times during a 15 min shower. It was small in size, I touched a wall if I bent down to get something. This made it challenging to shave my legs, but could do so balancing on the other. You could probably also do it by sitting on the closed toilet seat and stick your leg in the shower. The towels were like a bed sheet, very thin but very absorbant. Bring your own if you have to have plush towels. There is also a hair dryer, but it is not very powerful...would take a long time for someone with long or thicker hair to get dry. A tip: don't flush the toilet when someone else is in the shower, it makes it VERY hot! I cannot rave enough about the location of the hotel. The street is a connector between Via Nazionale and Via Quirinale. We were just down the street from the Piazza Quirinale, 5 min walk to the Trevi fountain and Trajan's column, 10 min walk to Victor Emmanuel Monument, 15 min walk to Colesseum and 20 min walk to Termini.

They called us a cab when we were running late to the Borghese, gave us croissants in the morning to take away when we didn't have time to sit down, and phoned when our car had arrived to take us to the airport at 5:20am.

So we went to a bank where was located far from the hotel to prepare cash, but they had a credit card machine...WHAT? We were shocked. The location was good, we could go many places in Rome.

The only surprise when we first arrived was that the hotel isn't on the ground floor - you have to be buzzed into the front door shared with other residents. It felt like a very safe neighborhood, with a strong police presence due to the nearby presidential palace (Quirinale). Like most European city hotel rooms, the room was compact but comfortable. Furnishings were in good shape and up-to-date. The included air conditioning worked quite well at all hours.

We were grateful for this, considering that I knew the street rooms would be noisy, and the courtyard itself tended to be somewhat noisy at times. The room was a little small, as we expected, as was the bathroom, which was the size of a closet, but both were clean, if not a bit worn (scuff marks on the walls). The shower fixtures were updated, though, and warm water was mostly available when we wanted it. We would have had an issue with the room if 1) the walls were so thin that my husband and I had to whisper if we wanted to speak privately since we could hear conversations down the hall and on the other side of our wall, 2) a funky smell had not permeated the air when the housekeeper put foot rugs into our room on the second day, and 3) we had amenities that I had taken for granted, such as a second trash can and tissues.
