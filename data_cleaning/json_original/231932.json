There are numerous hotels of a comparable price in the area that are sure to offer better value for money. We spent 4 dreadful nights in a dusty room that presented to the noisy street beyond. On our first night (Wednesday), the air conditioner dripped heavily onto the old timber floor boards below. We were greeted the following morning with a huge pooling of water across the room. We then requested the air conditioner be fixed, which reception agreed to. We returned in the afternoon to discover the drip had been resolved, but the air conditioner still wasn\u2019t operating. This was unacceptable given the humidity both outside and in). I reported the problem to reception who advised that I could change rooms the following morning, or that the air con unit would again be fixed. The next day we were unable to change rooms due to a \u2018full house\u2019. So we had to endure 4 nights in the wretched hot box that was supposed to be a 3 star room. Not ideal when you require a bit of energy to see the many sites of Rome. On the Saturday, we noticed that the hot water wasn\u2019t working. The cold water too was but a trickle. I again reported this to reception. I was initially advised that others in the hotel were probably using the hot water and that I\u2019d have to wait. I did, but to no avail. We were essentially without water both Saturday and Sunday, as were others who at this stage were lining up to complain. Upon departure, I complained about the lack of water and air conditioning. I was met with an obnoxious response from the receptionist who told me she \u2018just works there\u2019 and that she is \u2018not the manager\u2019. I reminded her that I had to complain to somebody and unfortunately it could only be her. She also said that \u2018these things happen\u2019 and that if there were plumbing issues on Friday, there was nothing they could do until Monday. That\u2019s right- this is a \u2018hotel\u2019 that expects its guests to go without hot water (and tolerate a dribble from the cold tap) for a weekend, because management is not prepared to pay an after-hours plumbing service to fix what is clearly an urgent problem. I told them that we would enjoy a better service from a youth hostel and that I simply do not understand how the hotel achieved a 3 star rating. The receptionist replied, \u2018stars have nothing to do with water\u2019. Well if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m still at a loss where 2 of their stars came from. If a hotel is rated according to its decor and furnishings, I give this hovel absolutely no stars. Similarly, it deserves no stars for its service, its meagre breakfast, or for its security (we had to leave our bags in a common corridor upon arrival, accessible to all and guarded by nobody). In addition the section of door panel around our lock had been carved away allowing anybody to easily manipulate the lock beyond. I insisted that I wasn\u2019t going to pay the full fee for our stay, which was enormous given the state of the place.

We were told that this is a \"better\" category 3 hotel in Rome in a cenral location. The centrality was the only true fact about the hotel. The air-conditioner did not work and the room overlooked a court filled with trash and a couple of old used toilet bowls. They moved us to another room, room 206, on the second floor, with a narrow bath tub. The tub floor was curved so that both my wife and I fell twice, fortunately with no accident. The air-conditioning did not work there either, but the weather got cooler so we did not need it. However the street noise was unbearable so we had to sleep with the windows completely shut. The plug in the bathroom was non-functional, the TV controller had a battery missing and the telephone worked erratically. We had booked a room with twin beds, but they gave us a double bed and a cot instead. And the pictures on their website are totally misleading. The view is not that of the Spanish steps but of a narrow noisy street, Via Sistina. In other words, it ruined our vacation. To add insult to injury, Manessis charged us more than 200 euro per night for this hotel, when comparable hotels - as we found out later - listed for about 120 euro per night. In conclusion Avoid Manessis and this hotel, and, if you can, make your own online reservations. This Greek travel agency was very disappointing and provided ver little help.

You can't be expecting beautiful, brand new, amazing hotels for this price, because you will be extremely disappointed. Me and my friends found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. They gave us good tips for restaurants etc. One night we spent half an hour talking to the woman working at the front desk about good pizza places, she even phoned about 3 different restaurants to ask if they would deliver it for us. The breakfast was not anything special, but we made our own creations with what we were given that ended up being a hit with everyone in our group. If you are on a tight budget, a good idea is to find a \"supermarket\" (you'll find them much different than the ones in north america, especially size wise) and buy snacks, veggies, fruit etc for those long tours and day trips, so you arent constantly having to buy food at cafes and eat out. What I loved most about this hotel, and I think many people will agree with me on this, is the amazing location. It is literally 2 mintues away from the beautiful Spanish steps (also where a metro station is conveniently located, making it very easy to get to almost anywhere in Rome) and if you have lots of money to spend, one of the most famous shopping districts in the world, the Via dei Condotti. I cannot remember if all of the rooms faced the Via Sistina (the street the hotel is located on), but our room did, and we never wanted to shut the window. I loved just listening to the sounds of the city, the vespas, cars, people talking etc..Rome is a very large city, one should expect it to be noisy. The view from the window was amazing too, looking down the narrow street as far as you could see. I personally loved Rome more than anywhere else I visited in Italy.

The price was good, location excellent, staff helpful, & rooms extremely clean & sanitary. I did not see any of the other rooms, but this one was perfect for me for the price. Had a small closet, 2 night stands with drawers, a desk, chair, small TV & double bed. Nice sized bathroom & sink with plenty of hot water. The only drawback was the small shower-- I had to turn sideways to get in & I am skinny!! But this was a small inconvenience for the price & location.

For reasons explained in that review, we checked out after 1 night and started searching for another place. Right around the corner was the Trinita dei Monte. The rate seemed good (15 euros lower than our other option), and the location is perfect (2 minute walk from the top of the Spanish Steps; 5-8 minutes to the Trevi Fountain; 25 minutes to the Colloseum). The room was typical of most 3 star european hotels, small, but comfortable, nicely appointed, good climate control, decent bathroom, and double paned windows for light and noise control. Very courteous staff, decent breakfast. The only weird thing about this hotel was that we stayed on the 2nd floor, but had to go up to the third floor to drop off our key everytime we left. Dropping off your key is typical of Italian hotels, but there was a bit of extra work involved. Nevertheless, it was a small price to pay for a nice hotel!!! When we return to Rome (unless we win the lottery and can stay in a 5 star) we will stay at the Trinita dei Monte again !!!", "Date": "September 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cSo-So Stay\u201d", "Author": "CamilleLongIsland_NY", "ReviewID": "UR2590927", "Content": "The best thing about this hotel is its location--down the block from The Hassler and The Intercontinental. It was clean and the staff were pretty helpful, depending on who was at the desk. They did arrange for a van from the airport when we arrived for 80 Euros for a group of 6 and the driver waited an hour and 40 minutes for us because of a delay. The breakfast was adequate and the breakfast area was okay, but nothing to write home about. There is really no lobby, other than the breakfast area behind the desk. The a/c was a disaster in 2 of our family's 3 rooms--working, but clunking away to little effect in one room. Street noise was also a problem sometimes. Don't know if we could have done better for 180 Euros a night in Rome. (They did reduce the rate to 140 Euros a night when we complained that 1 room was too small.)", "Date": "September 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, Costa Rica", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2483316", "Content": "Myself and family stayed at this hotel during 3 days in late July and found the hotel and its staff to be a pleasent surprise.
