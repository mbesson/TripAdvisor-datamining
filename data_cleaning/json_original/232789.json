The size of the room doesn't matter if there is a good use of space. clearly the designer did not think. I guess they're trying to be eco-friendly or lower their electric bill because there was only sensor lights in the hallways. scary and unsafe!! left in the dark hoping the next light would go on! They also charge extra for an in-room safe (this should be included in the standard price - who doesn't need a safe to put their valuables! annoying to even have it mentioned) In addition, the phone didn't work for external phone calls... since there was only one outlet I couldn't charge my mobile so I wanted to use the hotel phone.. either charge your phone or your camera - take your pick! The biggest turn off was the repulsive sewage odor. I thought I could stick it out since I was only in the hotel for shower and sleep but even that was unbearable due to the stench.

The furniture, the curtains and the floor make the atmosphere too depressive. It is supposed to be a 4 star hotel and they don't even have contemporary mattresses, instead they use simple white sheets that were never changed during our stay, a thin blanket on top and some cheap filthy bed covers! Most of the TV channels were not functioning. The room was on the front side of the hotel and was extremely noisy. We could hear people shouting in the street and ambulances passing by until early morning hours. Coffee at breakfast is awful. We found hair on top of some cookies one morning but nobody from the waiters ever noticed. The Front Office Staff are polite but don't expect to get much of information as a Tourist from them.

The shower nozzle kept on falling. The room was clean but it smelled musty. We had a balcony which overlooked the city but in order to do it, you had to stand on a scary foot stool in order to see down in the streets. The manager was not at all helpful with taxi information or any other questions about the city. He rarely smiled. Breakfast: The orange juice was full of pulp. It was wonderful. Breakfast was continental style. The coffee was terrible. They had yogurt, bread, sausages, milk, pastries, strange kind of cured meat and a goat flavored type cheese. The cream for the coffee was steaming hot and they had cold milk for the cereal box choices. The sausage was not very good and the eggs were cold. They had a toaster for the toast with jellies. Eating area was very clean....the service was good. The lobby should be smoke free but was not...we had to get used to everyone smoking everywhere. Also found out that dogs were allowed...gross! Didn't see any in the hotel though...no barking either. When we were ready to leave, we asked the front desk about the taxi to take us to the cruise ships. The manager again was not concerned about giving us any information. Too busy looking down at his paperwork....rude.... We had to ask many times for a copy of our paperwork for our files. We ended up walking with our luggage to the cruise ship because the taxi service people were fibbing about it being a holiday. It wasn't a holiday, it was just a Saturday and they wanted to charge an arm and a leg. The front desk could have given us this information. We had to find out about walking several blocks from a near-by store that spoke english.

The manager asked if she wanted her money back she just wanted to sleep and get moved to another room ...but he wouldn't move her saying the place was full when it was clearly not a full hotel. He said the only rooms available were the suites which would cost her more money. She was very upset. The bar area was never open. If this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel, where is the pool and all of the other things that go with a 4 star hotel.

To be honest, they are all accurate! Good points: Great location - Hotel Gotico is about a 10 minute walk from Las Ramblas and surrounded by great restaurants and shops. You could not wish for a better location. As there were 5 of us we were given a twin and triple room. The twin room was quite small but our room was huge (I think there're some photos of our room earlier on in this thread) and consisted of a twin room, separate single bedroom a bathroom and separate toilet. Clean - The room was extremely clean and the maids did a great job of servicing the rooms. The beds were made daily and fresh towels (which unfortunately had seen better days) were supplied. Breakfast - the breakfast (although typically continental) was more than adequate and on the final day we found some bacon and sausage which we hadn't spotted before. Not so good points: As stated by so many other reviewers, the hotel is definately not 4 star. It does not offer any facilities other than bed and breakfast and even though there is a bar in the reception area we never saw it open. We did enquire when it opened and were told \"in the morning\" but we never saw it open then either. It was frustrating that outside of breakfast time you could not even get a cup of coffee. Our rooms were on the back of the hotel. As they had no proper windows (ours looked out onto a ventilation shaft and the laundry area), it was very dark. As stated in the previous couple of reviews there was an awful drain smell, in our room made worse each time we flushed the toilet, to the point that we had to warn each other when we flushed the loo so we all prepared for the smell. However, you tend to become more immune to it as time goes on. The staff were ok and answered our questions, ordered taxis etc but they were not particularly friendly, rarely smiled and everything seemed like too much effort. In summary, Hotel Gotico is great if you just want a place to rest your head at night.

I will definitely stay here again when I return to Barcelona and have no problem recommending it to other people.", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cAVOID THIS HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "AdventureGuru", "ReviewID": "UR5792535", "Content": "I honesty don't know how this hotel has received 3.5 stars. There must be a different system than North America. This hotel was atrocious. The room was dingy and dark. There was mold and rust in the bathtub. The mattress was creaky and worn out. The front desk staff was rude and obnoxious. I asked for a breakfast restaurant recommendation and the guy working the front desk responded rudely saying there were lots of places around while waving his hand in a dismissive gesture like I was just a stupid tourist. To think that I paid $180 a night for this place really upsets me. The only bright spot was the very friendly maid who took time out to speak to me in Spanish and ask me how my vacation was going. She was great. But, this place should be avoided! I checked out the next day and found a very nice hotel called Hotel Axel. It caters mostly to gay clientele but bills itself as hetero-friendly. Not only were the rooms much nicer, cleaner, bright, well-appointed, etc but free bottled (as much as you want) was offered, along with a very friendly staff. It's only a 10 minute walk to the Gothic Quarter, but well worth the stroll. It's in a much less congested area and you won't get the tourist be damned attitude that was evident in the Hotel Gotico.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat loction, bad service\u201d", "Author": "Wissing", "ReviewID": "UR5627659", "Content": "We spent 5 days in Barcelona and stayed at Hotel Gotico.

If you are after the location then this is a good choice, since it is walking distance from La Rambla, and other touristic places. However the service is not so good, especially the person manning the reception desk during the days when we were there. He was not smiling, was not interested to answer our questions (as if we were a big burden to him). I wouldn't recommend staying here since there are so many hotels in the Gothic quarter. The other thing that i found lacking was even though there was a Wifi hotspot (Telefonica) in the hotel, they were not selling the prepaid cards to guests who want to avail of the service. They probably do not have many businessmen staying in the hotel. When i asked about this, they said the internet connection in the bar was free, but when i tried it several times it was not. They don't even know! I have brought my laptop with me during business trips and this is the only time i was not able to buy a prepaid internet card from the hotel.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4695226", "Content": "Perfect setting to visit the oldest area in Barcelona.

We had never been to Barcelona before and were looking forward to it. It was our 10th wedding anniversary and I had asked for an especially nice room prior to our stay. When we got there the room had twin beds and a really musty drain type smell. We stuck with it for the first night but asked to be moved to a room with a double bed (as requested on booking the hotel). We moved rooms the next day but this 2nd room was a lot smaller and the bathroom wasn't big enough to swing a cat! Again, there was a bad drains smell and the taps were falling off the wall in the bath. At least the first room was twice the size and had a bigger bathroom with taps that were in one piece. The hotel was in a fantastic location and it really was a shame that the hotel was dreadful. The breakfasts weren't much to shout about either and the tv in both rooms we stayed in only received foreign channels which we couldn't understand. When we asked at reception about the channels they sent someone up to look at them who played around with the remote for a while and then just said \"it doesn't work\" sorry. In general, good location, great city but rubbish hotel. I wouldn't recommend it at all. Maybe we had been spoilt in the past having stayed in some fabulous hotels including Dubai, Copenhagen, Hong Kong and many more. I am not sure where in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona has a good hotel to be honest, they all looked the same!", "Date": "March 1, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Gotico", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d232789-Reviews-Hotel_Gotico-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$131 - $237*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Jaime I, 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232789", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1e/1d/7e/hotel-gotico.jpg"}}
