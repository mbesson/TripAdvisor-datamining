Delicious!! The public transportation is great and you can very easily go to other areas of town.

The mattresses felt a bit worn and squeaky and there was only about one foot of space between the two beds, we might as well have booked a room with one big bed! Only one pillow on each bed and we never bothered to call down and ask for another assuming they would make us come down and get it ourselves. I say this, because when we checked in to a far from warm welcome no one told us about the wi-fi. So we made it up to our room and tried to open there free wi-fi but as you would expect you need a password. So we called down to the front desk to ask for the password and they told us we had to come down and retrive it from the front desk. Would have been nice to know that at the time of check in!

Firstly we were impressed that the hotel let us check in so very early in the morning without a question. The staff were very friendly. We did have a lot of luggage and there are steps off the street up to the lobby and again up to our room which may not be suitable for everyone. The entry steps and lobby are very impressive in this beautiful old building: Marble pillars, frescoed scenes on walls, plush carpets, big wooden banister with a large sculpted lions head. Really lovely entrance. The room was old but freshly painted and spotless. Linens were crisp and white and beds were comfortable which we needed for our afternoon nap and bathroom was very nice for the price paid. I remember enjoying the view from the window which looked out on the big intersection below. We were especially pleased with the location. We caught the train in from the Schoenfield airport (I think it's called) and caught the train right to Zoo station which was kitty corner to the hotel which was extremely convenient with all our luggage. We found a great little bakery/coffee shop around the corner and a really great restaurant just across the street for dinner. Berlin seemed so reasonable after Paris. We walked to the bombed out church up the street, and then through the big park up the long avenue to the Brandenburg Gate and Russian memorial and continued walking around to Checkpoint Charlie and other sights and then back to the hotel. The hotel is on one of the main shopping streets in the city and very convenient to many sights and to public transport so we were extremely happy with our choice considering our time was so short and we didn't want to spend all day on buses as we had a flight that night.

The 'refurbished' Belmondo is now a 3 star, but I really can't see why they were re-graded. The entrance and lobby of the hotel is fine, although the tacky plastic chandeliers let it down, however I'm fairly certain that our room was in the same state as our previous trip - the stains on the carpet looked that old at least. Our room size was good, with nice high ceilings and windows that faced out onto the K'damm. It's a shame that there is no aircon, as to have the windows open to get some air means it becomes very, very noisy. The bathroom is tiny, although the shower pressure was fine. The worst part for me was the bed - two iron frame singles pushed tgether. I don't mind that, however when one bed is approx 15 cm higher than the other it becomes something of a joke. Breakfast was fine, but it's not hard to get a continental buffet right. Staff were mostly ok, however when we asked for an iron and an ironing board (these are not supplied in each room), they were able to provide the iron but no board. My husband ended up pressing his shirt on a towel on the floor, and 30 mins later we had a call from the front desk stating that they 'had lost the ironing board'.

However, that's really the best aspect of staying here. If you are planning to stay here, one very important fact about this place is that THERE IS NO LIFT. So if you have heavy luggage then this is going to be problem, not even after you check in, but starting from before you even enter the front door. The front door is already up quite a few stairs, we had very heavy luggage and boxes as we were there for many days and had to bring work materials for the exhibition. Don't expect any help with your luggage as there is usually just one staff behind the desk and no one at the door. After we entered the front door there were more steps you have to take to get to check-in. The one staff that was there and was not occupied with anyone didn't feel the urge to help us eventhough we were going back and forth to get our things and drag them up the stairs to the check-in desk. We arrived at 6am and had booked rooms for the night before so that we would not have to wait until 2pm to be able to go in to the room and shower after our long flight. First thing the check-in staff did after seeing our names was tell us off for not checking in the day before or informing them. I explained to them that we meant to do that, that it was intentional, as we needed to check in at 6am so we were happy to pay one whole night for a few hours. She still thought it was ok to tell us off like we had done something wrong, that they could still sell those rooms had we informed them we would not be using them the night before we landed. I mean, why is she having a problem with this??? We paid for those rooms and we can use them or not use them as we please!! We weren't trying to avoid paying for that night or anything. We were completely aware of what we were trying to do. And if she was trying to sell those rooms that we had paid for and get double the amount by sneaking in an early leaver or something... well then that's pure dodgy. The room itself was ok but not great. Bathroom is literally 2 by 2 metres, so it's a tight squeeze. Only bathroom amenity was the soap/shampoo combo that is fixed on the wall. Shower cubicle could not keep the water in there so if you don't want to flood your room don't shower for too long. TV is about 12 inches max, might even be smaller. Pillow was was weird, was shaped kinda like a donut from the bottom up and was really uncomfortable. Also, you can get very well acquainted with the friendly neighbours here as I even heard the people next door doing it one night, quite loudly and clearly, just as I was getting to ready to go to bed. No internet available in the hotel, the only way is to use wi-fi and pick up T-Mobile's hotspot signals, which you can pay for, but it's very expensive. I do go to Berlin every year and will not be returning to Hardenberg again.

Location is perfect, right next to Zoo station, which is a hub for the main public transport system in Berlin. Buses 109 or X9 get you straight there from the airport for 2.10euro each and 1.40 for children. The journey takes 15 to 20 minutes. The Hotel is only 2 or 3 minutes from Zoo Station and as it's the last stop for the 109 or X9 you can't fail! Check in was quick and staff excellent, even gave my 6-year-old son a World Cup Teddy Bear! Staircase and lobby very impressive! Our room was on the 2nd floor and each room has the advantage of being down a locked corridor coming off the main staircase - this gives additional security as that means you have to use two keys, one to get into the corridor and one to get to your room. Rooms were large and beds big and comfortable. Bathroom large and like the room everything very clean and well maintained. TV had 46 channels including CNN and BBC World. Breakfast was really excellent. I've stayed is many many hotels much more expensive than this one, but this breakfast was superb. Service from the staff was excellent in the breakfast restaurant too. Location for shopping could not be better as the main shopping street in Berlin only 1 minute walk away. Check out the Karstadt Sport shop opposite, this has to be one of the biggest sports shops in the world! The Zoo is right across the street too and has 15,000 animals in there.
