{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great little hotel Classy little business hotel in the west end. I stayed here to visit friends who conveniently live on the same street. It is close to the parks and the festival halls but a good 20 minute walk to the train station, although the tram stop is very close.I would definitely use this hotel again when visiting my friends. If I were coming to Frankfurt as a tourist I would stay somewhere more central, although Frankfurt is so small that I walked pretty much everywhere.Staff are friendly and attentive, rooms are clean and bathroom spacious. Like most hotels in Frankfurt, it is more geared towards business users.", "Date": "Mar 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR800014734", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Dsleazy"}, {"Content": "Great Place and Staff Near the Messe.
