After my friend and I arrived in Playa Del Carmen, we discussed our itinerary and decided that it might be best to stay one night in a town by Chichen Itza. When checking in, we asked the receptionist at the front desk of Maya Bric whether it would be possible to change our reservation because we were still unsure as to our itinerary. She said that it was possible to pay by the day, since we didn't know if we would be staying in playa del carmen for the entire week. She never spoke of any financial ramifications due to the change in reservation. She then allowed us to pay for our first night in pesos for the night. We stayed at the Maya Bric Hotel for one night, and checked out the next day at noon since we found the hotel to be rather basic. However, the day after I returned home from my trip I received my credit bill and saw that the Maya Bric Hotel has charged me $341.37, for a whole week's stay. In the hotel policy that I read online and in email from BOOKING.COM the hotel policy says: -Deposit-100% of the first night will be charged on the day of booking and is refundable -Cancellation policy if canceled up to 2 days before date of arrival, no fee will be charged. -Cancellation policy if canceled later or in case of no-show, the first night will be charged Since my friend and I did stay for one night, I assumed the cancellation policy did not apply, and if it did, we had fulfilled it since we did indeed stay one night at the Maya Bric. After many calls to the Maya Bric, with little to no success, either having messages taken down, or not speaking to the manager at all, I enlisted the help of the people at BOOKING.COM (the site I used to book this hotel). Well, they called multiple times to plead on my behalf, and the manager refused to reimburse me for my money. The hotel manager stated that they have an INTERNAL cancellation policy that states they can charge the guest the full amount of their reservation, even though I was never informed of this when speaking directly with the receptionist regarding reservation changes. Long story short, this place was dishonest in their financial dealings, leaving little to no recourse for the customer. I highly advise budget travelers look to other hotels for their stay in Playa Del Carmen, as this place is not nearly as nice as other hotels in the area for the same cost!", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOne step up from a hostel\u201d", "Author": "doublechoc-chip", "ReviewID": "UR79920925", "Content": "To give an idea of context for this review, we were a group of 3 girls (aged 20, 31 & 32)spending 5 weeks travelling through Central America. We didn't fancy roughing it in hostels, but at the same time we were on a budget and couldnt afford to splurge. We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from 1st August 2010. Location: Amazing location! We arrived in Playa on the ADO bus and it was about 5 minute walk from the bus station to the hotel. The hotel is literally right on the busy main strip of Playa del carmen (restaurants, shops, Starbucks), just one row back from the beach. The beach there is beautiful and the weather was fantastic (in fact it got a bit too hot). Despite being central, when you walk through the lobby to the back (where the rooms are), the noise of people seems to vanish and you are in a gorgeous little garden oasis with a small pool and tables and chairs to sit out. Room: The room had a damp musty smell, that wasnt unbearable, but it was enough that we could smell it on our bedclothes when we took them out at the next place after this that we stayed. We had a room with 2 double beds and a/c. The bathroom was partitioned off from the main room but its walls didnt reach the ceiling fully (2-3 foot gap at the top) if that makes sense, so it wasnt exactly noise-private. Also the room had a/c, which was much needed, but it was antiquated and RIDICULOUSLY loud! I'm not a light sleeper and have never been bothered by a/c in the past, but this was so loud it was like you were on a plane. It meant that we had to wear ear plugs in the end as it was too hot to sleep without it on. I dont know if all the rooms are like that though, we might have just been unlucky. The shower was fine except that they seem to have a limited hot water supply as by the time I took a shower after my friends one day, the water was freezing cold. Otherwise the room was clean and felt safe. Breakfast: Not included. Price: For our stay, double rooms with a/c were 660 pesos a night and with fan 600 pesos per night, but I strongly recommend you get the a/c -just remember your ear plugs! Each additional person (over 2 people) is 160 pesos/night. We booked direct with the hotel via mail (info@mayabrichotel.com) and were going to pay on credit card, but when we arrived we were told that the credit card charge had gone up from 4.5% to something crazy like 15%, so paid by cash instead. Tips: Round the corner from the hotel (turn left out of the hotel and then your next left towards the beach) is a restaurant called Season Bistro whcih I highly recommend. The waitress was amazing, the food was delicious, we were offered a free drink with our meal (my friend chose red wine and must have got over 1/3 of a bottle in her glass!) and the total bill for 3 (3 main courses) came to just 460 pesos (\u00a323). The staff here were great and so long as you dont mind the smell and the a/c noise, its a good, cheap enough place to stay for a few nights.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Honest People.

We decided to make our trip adventurous by not booking a hotel prior to our trip.

We walked about 6 or 7 blocks from the bus station to the hotel (if I remember correctly it's between Calle 8 and Calle 10 on 5th ave; it's very close to the restaurant Parilla). The entrance to the hotel is through a huge double door (that's open except for late at night when it's still unlocked), which makes it seem like you're entering a big Mexican hacienda. The hotel rooms (3 levels; about 30 rooms) overlook a medium-sized pool and tropical trees and plants scattered throughout the grounds. The rooms are average-sized for a budget hotel (we paid 550 pesos/night after a brief negotiation; the listed rate was $60, which is about 650 pesos). They were well-kept and clean. We had an AC unit but didn't use it because it costs 100 pesos extra and the fan worked fine for us (you'll probably need to use it if you visit in the summer). Overall, we were very satisfied.

Unfortunately, these do not outweigh the negatives of an unpleasant one-night stay at the Maya-Bric. I should say that given the cost of the hotel, accounting for its location and the time of year (Christmas-New Years), I probably should not have expected much more than I got. But I am forever the optimist. I realize that, given the many positive reviews of the facility, there is a faithful cadre of people who will disagree with me, but, hey, it's my unvarnished TripAdvisor opinion. On to the complaints: (1) Let's start out with the most disconcerting thing about the hotel: toilet paper could not be flushed down the toilet, but had to be put in the handy garbage cans provided in the bathroom - uh, I don't think so. I never ascertained the reason for this, maybe it was a post hurricane thing and is now corrected. I would definitely make sure that you can flush before you go. (2) \"It's a bathroom.\" \"It's a shower.\" It's a bathroom.\" \"It's a shower.\" \"Wait, it's a bathroom and a shower!\" The bathrooms were more reminiscent of what you see in an RV, with no line of demarcation, other than a shower curtain, between the shower head and the toilet. (3) Does anyone in Mexico believe in providing sufficient light in a hotel room to read? (4) I'm sure that some day, when I'm dead and on a marble slab, I'll be laid out on a harder surface, but for now, these beds just moved into first place. Part of the problem here is that one does not go to the Riviera Maya to move this far down the hotel food chain. I have been visiting the Yucatan at least once a year for the past nine years and the changes being wrought in a place like Playa are amazing (and sometimes disappointing), but, the city has moved well beyond backwater status.

The room had 2 double beds and was very clean. The hotel is in a good location on Quinta, the attractive foot mall but the noise from the nightclubs can be heard every night. We turned the fan onto high to drown out the noise. We didn't book a room with airconditioning and it wasn't necessary in December. If we had needed it we could have had it connected for an extra US$10 per night. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and there is free internet use in the lobby. There are many excellent restuarants and shops in the mall. We flew into Cancun airport and took the new direct bus service from the airport to Playa del Carmen which cost US$6.50 pp. We saw the bus counter just before exiting the arrival hall and the bus leaves every 30 minutes from the car-park to the far right of the airport exit.", "Date": "January 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brandon Manitoba Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Spot\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3015483", "Content": "This will be our third year at the Maya Bric now known as the Tank Ha. The rooms are simple but very clean. Rooms are cleaned daily and look as good as the day you checked in after they have cleaned them. The staff are all very friendly and willing to help you with any concerns or questions you may have. Nice friendly staff in the office area as well. The sitting area has a TV with VCR is a nice gathering place to meet your neighbours that are staying there. The pool is sparkling and feels so good after a day of being at the beach or touring. We can't wait to get back home to the Maya Bric.", "Date": "January 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "michigan", "Title": "\u201cfrequent guest\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2973705", "Content": "I have stayed at the Maya Bric on several occassions over the last six years and find it to be great value for your money. It is clean, convenient and the staff is friendly and very helpful. The pool is located only steps from your room (very convenient!) Air conditioning is available yet we have found that with the cooler night air in March, it was not needed. The location is prime...located beside a great little place called \"Tropicana\" and only a couple of blocks from the beach. What more could you ask for on vacation. Sylvia manages the hotel and is always there to assisst you.
