When we called to get bath towels, were were told that the laundry delivery service did not show up that day. We had to dry off using hand towels that day, but it worked, so that is a very little complaint. The next day we had normal size bath towels again.

I booked with Eurostar and paid just under \u00a3350 (around 420\u20ac/US$550) room only, including return Eurostar from London which I thought was very reasonable. Staff on reception (24h/24) were very helpful and friendly, and although I managed to get by in French it appeared that most also spoke reasonable English. My room (a double, 3rd floor, accessed by a small lift) was perhaps a little small for a couple, but for me as a solo traveller, it was fine, and it was really just somewhere to sleep; the lack of view didn't bother me for the same reason. Cleanliness was perfectly adequate, although there were a few traces of mildew in the shower in the otherwise spotless bathroom. Daily visits by the friendly maid kept the room tidy throughout my stay. The room also featured free wifi, cable TV, hairdryer, safe and plenty of wardrobe space. Breakfast, served from 6h30 to 10h00, was a generous self-service buffet of coffee/tea/fruit/cold meats/cheese/cereal/juice/petit pain and a selection of pastries (croissant/pain au chocolat etc.). Not haute cuisine, but very reasonably priced at 10\u20ac. But if that doesn't appeal, there are plenty of bars/cafes nearby. The hotel is superbly located, being 10 minutes' walk from Gare du Nord (ideal for those arriving by Eurostar) and 2 minutes from Gare de l'Est, so even though it's a little way out of the city centre (Xe arrondissement), there are excellent transport links to all the main sights by bus/metro/RER virtually on the doorstep. And even though this is a busy area of Paris, the hotel is down a little side street - Rue des R\u00e9collets - so I didn't notice any noise. Opposite is a local park (Jardin Villemin), while at the far end of Rue des R\u00e9collets is the Canal Saint-Martin (and the bridge on which Amelie stood in the film!) so there are peaceful spots nearby to relax. I would give Villa Saint-Martin 4.5/5, only deducting half a mark for the mildew in the shower and the slightly small size of the room - but these didn't detract from my stay at all and I only mention these in order to be objective.

The hotel was ok - but wouldn't want to spend much more than a couple of days there. The rooms are very small and dark, although very clean. The beds are quite small, but the bedding immaculate. Shower leaked badly, so floor was flooded every time we took a shower. Breakfast was really a lottery. If you got there early before the rush, it was very nice with fresh bread, hams and cheeses and on occasions boiled eggs. There was also fresh fruit, yoghurt and pastries. However, the dining room is VERY small given the number of bedrooms, so if you don't get there early enough there are neither seats, food or crockery left! It would appear they are severely understaffed in the breakfast room. No one clearing tables or replenishing the food area. The one big positive is that the ladies on reception were always very pleasant and very helpful. The area is lovely - although it looks a little run down at first, its really a very safe area. Step out of the hotel and turn right, and there are several bars and restaurants on each side of the street. A particular mention to L'Atmosphere at the bottom of the street on the left hand side. Good little bar for a drink. Chez Marie Louise is a restaurant about 10 mins walk away and the food and service here are top class - however, would recommend booking as it was full on a Thursday night and people were being turned away. Les Enfants Perdu is another restaurant on Rue Recollets (turn right outside the hotel and walk a couple of hundred yards and the restaurant is on the left) which served excellent food but again would be advantageous to book.

If you arrive on the Eurostar and don't want to walk (About 15 mins to hotel) or take a taxi, go via metro.

If you cross the traffic lights you will see Rue des Recollets on the left and the hotel is on the right hand side.

(Note for ladies there are hairdryers in the bathrooms) The staff - Mariana, Helena and Charlotte were superb and spoke good English. Nothing was too much trouble and when we wanted to go to Parc de Prince stadium they rang ahead to get details for us! Breakfast is served in the bar area until 10am - buffet style and was good. The rooms are well insulated compared to others I've stayed in and though small were perfectly functional. There are varying reviews on which floor to stay but we stayed on the 4th floor (room 445 - twin room) which was at the front of the hotel. There was a lift too.The road noise is minimal and as we were higher up it was ok. Bathroom was good and modern, though if you didn't want to flood the bathroom floor make sure you put the shower curtain inside the shower tray!

We got off at CDG airport and just jumped straight on the Bus dropped off an hour later right at hotel for 5 euros. Cant argue with that. Train takes u to Gare Nord then you will have to get the metro. Hotel rooms are very small yes, but we were hardly in ours...only to sleep late at night after walking Paris which is beautiful at night. Metro passes are a MUST.(20 euros each for a paris visite pass for 3 days at any station also comes with discount booklet for sites etc) City is very big...first day we walked alot, following day we were doing the metro and seen MUCH more stuff. It just felt great at anytime to hop on and off anywhere u wanted like Eiffel Tower at night then off to Sacre Couer to watch over the City. Staff at hotel are extremely helpful, speak perfect english although i try my best to speak in french. Breakfast is continental but plenty of it. Hams, Cheeses, Boiled Eggs, Croissants, Breads, Jams and coffee. Top tip..coffee machine push for cafe au lait then push for expresso so u get a shot in it as quite weak on its own. We personally never bothered getting the Paris Pass or museum passes as for a few days they are not worth it as you will never ever have the time to visit everywhere. We done things included in these passes that we wanted like the Lourve, Arc de Triomphe, Notre Dame and crypt, Catacombs, Parisien river cruise and Metro passes for cheaper than the tourist passes. It all depends on how much time you have and what you want to visit. Its worth planning and researching beforehand!! Eating out can be expensive..best to go for a Plat de Jour, which is a set menu, we found a lovely French Traditional place and got salmon and herring for starters, 10oz Rump, then cheeses plus bottle of red for 53 euros. Exremely good price..we just stumbled on it, very small cozy and quaint and typical french. Japanese is big here...we got a good deal over in the Latin Quarter for Sushi and its excellent..less than 40 euros with drinks. If you wanna pay top dollar then dont worry, easy to find..we read a menu..5 Course with Bottlle of wine and glass of champagne for only 830 euros!!! YES...830 euros haha. So always check the menu prices outside before sitting down and embarrasing yourself by getting up to leave again at some monstrous price. There are hundreds of hotels in Paris scattered everywhere but this was the best 3star deal we found which incidentally had the best reviews.

It's pretty and we walked there at night when we could not sleep. There are also some cute boutiques along the canal. If you turn left from the hotel and left again on the main street, the Istanbul cafe, a Middle eastern restaurant has good eats for very reasonable price. I recommend the curry chicken and the shawerma sandwich. After meals, you get free chai tea on the house. Abdullah who waited on us was a sweetheart and can speak some English. His family owns the restaurant. There is plenty of seating upstairs. When you look inside the restaurant, it doesn't look like there is any seating left, but the entire 2nd floor has tables and is quite nice. Hotel rooms are a bit small but you are in the city.

My only complaint about the hotel was there was a persistent smell of smoke in our room although it was a non smoking hotel.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Staff.\u201d", "Author": "BonnieMax", "ReviewID": "UR102249954", "Content": "I stayed in a superior room 111, this is meant to be a little larger than a standard room.

The hotel is a good solid choice. As with any hotel in Paris, rooms are a little on the small side but have all the amenities. I was in a single, which had a recent reno of the bathroom. Shower was very small, I am 6' 3\", and could barely fit, but the bathroom was very clean. In the main part of the room, there is barely enough room for the double bed, but again, it was quite clean and I did have a small closet and a desk from which to work. My wife and daughter were in a double room, which was a little larger and had a recent reno on the bathroom as well. Again, size being what it is in Paris, the tub was so small that I could not fit and my wife and daughter could barely fit. Nonetheless, it is a clean and nice hotel. Location, while not that near the downtown, is literally across the road from Gare de L'Est, a main train station and a stop on the Metro. The Metro, is excellent and easy to follow and get arpouind as a mode of transportation. We bought a 5 day pass for each of the three of us on the Metro for 90 Euros and used the Metro continuously. You can generally speaking get anyhwhere in Paris using the Metro. The breakfast was nioce, not to over the top, but fairly good choices were available. Our biggest thanks went to the front desk staff, Charlotte especially, but also Marianna, Benedicte and Veronique. On the whole, Parisiens are not that friendly or service oriented, but the front desk staff was excellent. They took care of every request and wish easily and with a smile. In fact, we had our passports stolen (watch out for pickpockets in Paris - very bad) and the assistance from the front desk staff was outstanding.

The ladies understood my situation and gladly assisted without any questions. Check in was not until 2pm but i had to express some milk. The kind lady at recep was kind enough to offer me a room that is ready on the 1st floor before 2pm. I did not mind of course. I really appreciate her kind understanding. Everyday i see different faces at reception and these smiley faces provide service that i can safely label as high class service. Here are the main areas which I can commend::: Reception: ALL and i mean ALL of them were fluent in English. They were mainly ladies and they were cheerful and super friendly and helpful and POLITE! :)) Room: VERY clean and comfortable. Bathroom: was not expecting a fancy one but this hotel bathroom provides stylish shower area with massage and 2 different shower heads AND a nice and clean wash basin area. Free shower soap and lotion also provided. The towels were thick and really absorbent and good. View: We were on the 1st floor and looking out the window we could see some shrubs but that did not bother me and my bro at all. when it is warm at night,we would leave the window ajar for a while to let the cool air in. Location: Very near Gare del Est metro,barely 5 mins walk and there are cafes and shops all around. surprising that area is not noisy and disturbing. Safe outlook, fret not! If you are looking for halal food, just walk around the corner and you will find kebab joints. 1 that we ate at actually closes at 12 midnight. Beside the hotel is a bookshop and a graffiti shop and also near a shop selling arms. Interesting... :) Breakfast: Bread, fruits, yogurt,freshly baked croissants ans chocolate pastries,cheese slices,and some meat slices. They have a stylish espresso machine. You can even make yourself a hot chocolate! Cool! Definitely will not consider staying anywhere else but here! booked online and got the best price (winter season) including breakfast.

It was our first wedding anniversary and the hotel was perfect for our stay. It is situated a five minute walk from Gare de L'est and so is ideally located for anyone arriving by either Eurostar (as we did) or by plane as CDG and Orly airport both have direct links to this station. There is also a Metro on the road opposite the hotel. I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to inform them of our wedding anniversary and upon arrival we had been upgraded to a better room as a result - this was very kind of the hotel and it was a nice start to our anniversary trip. The room itself was spacious and the bathroom was a nice size, the hotel provided nice, good quality complimentary toiletries (not the bog standard) which was also a nice touch. The television in the room only had one english speaking channel - CNN - which is annoying to the point of irritation (the channel!) so it was a good thing that the television wasn't charged to the room as an extra! I only add this point as information for any english speaking people looking to book the room, but to be honest after a day's sightseeing we were always too exhausted to watch tv anyway! The only negative I could say about this hotel would be the thin-ness of the walls - we literally heard the conversations and toilet habits of the two adjoining rooms - as a result we spoke in whispers most of the time - the window's are double glazed and so we heard little or no outside noise at all - I don't suppose anything can be done about this but then again, the hotel should really only be used as a stop-gap in between sight seeing so I guess it would only really irritate you if you spent a long time in your room? That said, compared to other hotels in Paris, this one offered extremely friendly and helpful staff and a good sized room.. It was very reasonable price wise and worked extremely well for us location wise so we were able to make the best use of the time we had there. If we ever returned to Paris I would not hesitate in booking this hotel again. We never got up for breakfast so i cannot comment on the quality of the food on offer. We ate locally one night and at Bistro 31 on the night of our anniversary (fabulous food and surroundings..cannot recommend it enough) we ate at a chinese resteraunt another night which was pleasant enough and made do with sandwiches and portable food the rest of the time. I would recommend to all to purchase your tickets for the Eiffel Tower online prior to leaving, this avoids you having to queue for hours and ensures you are able to access the tower quickly and easily (at your agreed time of booking) it also lessen's the time you have to spend avoiding the irritiating street sellers (who all sell exactly the same rubbish souvenirs within feet of each other!) and who continually badger the tourists who are queuing for their tickets! I would also recommend buying the metro and train tickets online prior to arriving, we were able to get off the eurostar and hop on to the metro without having to try and navigate our way through the awkward -ness of trying to buy tickets speaking in broken french/english! Bottom line is that this hotel is well located for travel and for all the sights of Paris that you want to see. The staff are extremely polite and helpful not to mention knowledgable. I would definately recommend this hotel to my friends or family - indeed anyone looking to stay in Paris.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, CO", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel in Paris\u201d", "Author": "summerchill13", "ReviewID": "UR92211613", "Content": "We arrived in Paris on Christmas Eve.

I wish I could use it to advertise Paris to everyone back home. The staff are so very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them. The restaurant is comfortable, breakfast was excellent each day with a large selection of pastries, cereal, breads, fresh fruit salad, meats and cheeses. Fruit juice and tea/coffee also provided. Best value breakfast I have encountered in most places I have travelled. Location is close to everything. Metro (Gare de l'Est) is 2 minutes walk. A selection of restaurants to suit all budgets are similar (try the Indiana on the corner opposite Gare de l'Est for the burgers and Cafe de l'Est just past there for traditional French fare). The walk along Canal St Martin, 2 mins in the opposite direction to the railway station, is spectacular, and typically Parisian. Just wonderful Rooms were traditional Paris, smaller than some cities, but better than I had hoped for. Still very comfortable. Bathroom was a bonus with a 3/4 bath and well appointed. Not huge, but still excellent compared to other Hotels in Paris. If you have an option, ask for a room facing Rue de Recollets, the view is sensational In the middle of a snowy Paris over Christmas/New Year, the rooms were always comfortably warm. I had no problems at all with the a/c, it worked very well. After an initial glitch with the WiFi, which the staff went out of their way to fix, it worked well and was quick and stable. In room TV is mostly French, with CNN in English. One more English speaking (non US)channel would be fantastic, but is only a very very minor point - more a request than a criticism.

Our \"superior\" room was in a corner with only one window which we had to leave open every night because it was so hot in our room (no AC, I know this is normal, just letting you know about the window). The bathroom was really nice in this room though but again save your money - my opinion. I even inquired at the reception as to the \"superior\" difference and she seemed flustered and did not understand me so I did not insist as HEY, we were on vacation and I argue enough at work, ha ha. We ended up staying here two more nights due to the strike and we loved the regular room we had (this is why I think the difference is the bathroom). It was larger and had three windows viewing the street so it was nice and cool. The shower was so tiny but I know this is normal for Europe...made for good entertainment hearing my husband hit the walls over and over again during his shower. I would say it is about 2ft x 2ft? Most of the staff was friendly though some did not understand or could communicate in English very well but I do not blame them as we are in THEIR country.

I had never been there before and was SO excited to go. Well, I got off the Metro at Gare du l'Est, which is a two minute walk from Villa St. Martin -excellent, except I got off the Metro when it was getting dark, with my suitcase in an unfamiliar neighborhood. My immediate impression: wow, this neighborhood is seedy. Besides the general uncleanliness of the city (and I'm from NY), there were quite a few strange men on the short walk to the hotel. Women, just be careful if you are walking about this area by yourself, especially at night. Anyway, we got to our hotel and it was small but welcoming. The reception area is nicely presented and the staff were very nice and answered our questions. One man in particular even looked something up on the internet without us even asking, just so he could assist us. Anyway, we got into the elevator (two petite girls with two suitcases) and squished inside -this elevator is SMALL! We made it to our room, opened the door, and WHAM, the smell hit us instantly. I have to agree with the other reviewers on here -the smell from the canal is VERY unpleasant. We were also greeted by three flies flying around our room -not a good first impression (they were gone the next day and the remaining part of our stay). I did notice, however, that the AC was working and that our room, while not as big as in American hotels, was certainly big enough to move around. The bed sheets also seemed clean and the beds were so-so. The bathroom is maneuverable too, but I have to agree that the shower is very small (and I'm only 95 lbs). I had to open the shower door and soak the floor so I could shave my legs. We had free breakfast included, which was fruit, meats, bread and pastries. My only complaint about it was the very warm milk they had out everyday. Oh yeah, while the front desk service was very helpful, my sister and I were not pleased that every time we put the \"Do Not Disturb/Do Not Clean the Room\" sign, we would come back to our hotel with the sign off of the door, our sheets cleaned, beds made. While this wouldn't bother some people, it really bothered us because we hadn't locked some things away and were concerned with our privacy. What is the point of even having the sign if they're just going to ignore it??? The hotel served its purpose, but as a person who has stayed in many hotels around the world, this is definitely not at the top of my list. The front desk service was good, but it can't make up for the flies, the smell that hits you every time you open your door, the lack of privacy, and the neighborhood.

The rooms are small but clean and we were lucky to have the A/C working and we couldn't hear anything from outside so we always had a good night sleep. The lighting could have been better because I had a hard time putting on my make up every morning since they use dimmed/yellow lights and even if I open the curtains, I still don't get enough lighting. The bathroom is small but manageable and the only thing I didn't like about it is that the tub is quite high and I had a hard time getting out of the tub without slipping. For a small bathroom, they should just use a regular shower instead of a shower/tub. Me and my husband were pleased with the breakfast since it starts early from 6:30 - 10 am and since we took some early trips to the champagne region, we were able to eat breakfast at 6:30 since we have to leave the hotel by 7am. The only downside, which I didn't really like is that everytime you go out, you have to give your room keycard to the receptionist and you can take it when you get back but they don't ask for your last name or a security question. I'm just concerned that anybody can just walk in and give a room no. and what if coincidentally they had the room no. right? Also, we always leave the \"do not disturb\" sign out the door, which has translations in french and other languages but somehow, housekeeping would always go in and clean the room for us. It is a nice gesture but other hotels are strict about their clients wishes and if they see the \"do not disturb\" sign, they just leave fresh towels, toilet paper, soap, etc. in a bag outside the door. Since the \"do not disturb\" sign doesn't work for us and since we have to give our room keycard everytime we go out, we make sure our luggages are always locked just in case.

After reading all the reviews for this hotel I was really pleased to secure a booking. It was fairly easy to find, we chose to walk from Gare du Nord and it only took 10 mins, Gare de L'est is about 3 mins so very handy for public transport .We got a really good deal with breakfast included, so we were really pleased with that. The hotel is spotless, not a bit of dirt anywhere. But after taking our luggage up to our room I was so disappointed. The room was so dark and dingy you had to have the light on day and night. The view from our window was the window into another room or a wall about 8 foot high, and we were on the 3rd floor. but as my husband pointed out we were only going to sleep in it. Easy for him to say but he didn't have to have the light on to put make-up on.If we wanted to see what the weather was like we had to go downstairs and look out side What made it worse was a day later I passed one of the front facing rooms that were being made up and it was so light and airy I could have cried. It looked so lovely. The good point about our room was the bed it was so comfy, I wish I could have brought it home with me. All the staff are so kind and helpful, they really go out of their way to help. Especially the four girls on the front desk. So on the plus side, the beds are lovely, the staff are wonderful, the hotel is spotless, the public transport is great. The minus side is room 339 is awful, there are no coffee/tea facilities in the rooms, the breakfast room is too small for the number of guests. On the strength of room 339 I dont think we will go back, but for someone who doesn't mind a dark room the hotel is perfect.

It was the best decision we made our entire trip. We stayed 4 nights at the hotel. What a hidden secret!. First off, ALL of the staff speak English. That helped us so much. A young man by the name of \"Willie\" greeted us and throughout our stay, helped us so much with directions and suggestions on here to eat and better yet.... where NOT to eat. The last thing you want on a trip abroad is stomach problems. The next best gem about this hotel is the location. If you are coming by train, it is only a block away from the Est. Train Station. The underground Metro is also only a block away. My wife and I got a room on the 5th floor facing the street and my son and his wife had a room on the 4th floor, facing the courtyard. We had no complaints. It was exactly what we wanted. Two huge windows that opened up above the streets of Paris. The sounds and sights were just what we wanted. The room was cleaned daily along with fresh linen. There is a very small cafe off to the side of the front desk. There they provide a continental breakfast for 10 Euro a person. I would suggest eating there each morning because at 10 Euro you aren't going to get a better price on the street for all the different selections available. The only suggestion I would say is to get there early because seating is tight and once it fills up, it's kind of an problem moving around and accessing the food and drink. After hours you can always get a Coke or hot tea from this location. The bar is open in the evening, but who stays in their hotel room in Paris in the evening? Your in Paris, get out, see the sights and hear the sounds of this historic city. The elevator is a classic European one. Folks it's small... get use to it and move on. Two people and maybe some luggage will fit but it eventually gets you to your floor. My son loved his room. They kept the window open all night and never heard a sound. Now the street side of the hotel is a different story. Don't expect the city to shut down at 10PM because you are going to sleep. If you keep your windows open you will be awaken by school children across the street in the morning. There are three hospitals in the area and the French emergency vehicle drivers love to travel with their sirens on, coming and going. So you will hear the High, Low, High, Low sirens passing on nearby streets. If this bothers you, the windows shut out 98% of the noise out once they are closed. We would recommended this hotel to everyone. It's not a Holiday Inn. It is a traditional French hotel designed to European standards, not American.

It was very easy to find, located very close to the Gare de l'Est train station, which was great for two jet-lagged individuals. We came in from Orly and took public transit all the way there, as well as to CDG on the way home. While close to public transit and walking distance to a ton of stuff, the neighborhood was pretty quiet and safe. It is blocks from the Canal St. Martin. Our room, which was on the 4th floor and faced the street, was small but totally adequate. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, just a clean place to sleep. When we checked in I asked the woman at the front desk if we could switch from a twin room to one with a double bed, and she recommended that we keep the twin because the room was bigger. I thought that was nice, and we managed just fine by pushing the two little beds together. We had plenty of space for the two of us, and we weren't there to hang out in a hotel room anyway! The room also had a safe, which was helpful. The bathroom was clean and super tiny. We had the smallest shower I had ever seen, and, being tall Americans, it was a bit of an adjustment. But honestly it was fine - as I said, cleanliness was paramount. The staff were all very nice and accommodating. Every interaction we had, with anyone from the front desk to the housekeeping staff, was pleasant. We made an effort to speak French (we both speak enough to get by) but they always took pity on us an spoke to us in English. Breakfast (served every morning from 6:30-10) was great. There was a good selection of stuff: ham, cheese, cereal, pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee, tea... It was nice to know that at least one meal of the day would be taken care of without having to think too hard! The only real issue I had with the hotel (and it was minor) was that we were dealing with major jet lag the first few days and wanted/needed to sleep a bit in the morning, but the housekeeping staff were overzealous and kept knocking, even if the \"do not disturb\" sign was on the door. I appreciate that they wanted to make up the room every day, but isn't that what the sign is for? To indicate that you don't want to be disturbed?

Now we didn't want to spend a lot on a hotel as we wanted more money to spend in Paris, our two finalists were a hotel near the Luxembourg Gardens and this one, we chose this one as it was a touch cheaper and from the website looked fantastic. Probably a good move now I think about it! I emailed the hotel before we went to confirm the reservation as it was our honeymoon and I didn't want to be chucked in a 2 star down the road as some people were! I received a lovely email saying it was confirmed and thanks for choosing them for our honeymoon, they were honoured. On the day of our wedding we travelled to Paris and our flight was delayed 2 hours, by the time we walked through a busy airport terminal and two metro stations we managed to get to the hotel at 10:30pm instead of 7:00pm of course not the hotels fault but we were exhausted. When we got there we were greeted by a charming woman and a lovely foyer, the hotel looked fantastic, and we were then congratulated on our wedding that day but received nothing? I know it's a little bad to shave points for not upgrading or something similar but we didn't receive a thing, no flowers, no champagne, no room upgrade, nothing! Everyone I know who stayed in a hotel on their Honeymoon has had something! The hotel was quite empty as well so a room upgrade would have been ideal! We shrugged this off and were sent up the lift to our room, after walking around the 3ft wide corridors for 15 mins sweating in the Parisian heat and lugging a 20kg suitcase around I went back down only to be told we were on the other side of the hotel on the top floor, there was no lift this time and we had to walk up stairs, we stayed optimistic and decided it was our honeymoon and we would forget that as it had been a long day. When we reached our room I couldn't believe how small it was, I live in a relatively small house but this room and bathroom was no bigger than our front room, there was about enough room for the furniture and one person comfortably approx 10x10ft. The Bathroom was even smaller and probably about 5ft by 5ft. I had to sit on the far front edge of the toilet seat as my legs hit a wall and the shower to the left and right of me, I also had to step in the shower sideways and squeeze in being 6'1\" and 18st. My wife is 5'0\" 8st but she didn't like the fact there was nowhere to store her shoes and dresses! We thought about asking to move but we didn't want to be rude and we were so tired from a wedding day and travelling, we'd also unpacked. I stretched up one morning out of bed and my hands hit the ceiling, it turned out to be a thick rubbery plastic membrane and not a white painted ceiling, it was like a massive trampoline on the ceiling!! One accidental slash and the whole ceiling would come down raining plaster and stones and spiders everywhere!! My guess is that it was a cheap way to cover the AC units but it was very tacky and dodgy, it didn't make the rooms\u2019 very sound proof either! Our window view was a random apartment and part of the hotel as well as the hotel courtyard which consisted of a scabby stone path and dirt/weeds; there was also a fantastic display of old bathroom sinks on the floor that seemed to be doing nothing. The breakfast was fantastic and there was a selection of cheese and ham, boiled eggs, croissants, pain au chocolat, melon, yogurt, cereal, bread, coffee, OJ. My wife and I loved this; it fuelled us up nicely for an early start in Paris. There was also a big screen with the news in French but it let you know the weather for the day which was handy! Everyone in the hotel was friendly and smiled and was very helpful and our room was cleaned every single day with towels and sheets being replaced without us even asking, it really was an immaculately clean hotel, the cleanest I have stayed in. The area around Villa Saint Martin is a tad dirty and seedy. There is a lot of rubbish about and it's a predominately muslim/african neighbourhood. There were a lot of homeless people sleeping on the streets and there was a surprising amount of dog mess on the pavements. There was also the odd prostitute hanging around (Probably a good point for some?). It was quite smelly as well (You know that holiday smell of sewage that drifts by your nose while walking?) In the day it was just run down Paris but at night it seemed a little rough. Towards the Canal was a lot better and there were various bars and bistros and a big Supermarche but again at night this was a tad rough. The area is right next to Pigalle the red light district of Paris so it's probably expected but when you've spent the day wandering the Latin Quarter or St Germain Des Pres you long for clean streets and other tourists. I know again it's not the hotels fault but this is a main aspect of choosing a hotel and I think location is a biggy! The Gard D L'Est is 3 mins walk and this is a main stop on the No 4 Metro line which is your main route into Paris' centre so getting into Paris was very easy. It was also relatively easy to get the RER to the airport from here so transport wise you\u2019re in a good spot. I would say this hotel is perfect for those on a business trip as it's close to train station and airport and a quick trip to the centre. Or if your on a Stag Night/Hen Night in Paris it's ideal as there are bars and restaurants and the red light district, it's a 30 min walk to Paris nightlife as well I believe. It\u2019s definitely not for a honeymoon couple and it's not for the retired couple looking to see Paris. If you like spending time in your hotel room with your Wi-Fi and 10million channels id say no as well. Clean, cheap & cheerful but very small and not nicely situated. Def not #148 of nearly 2000 hotels in Paris. Sorry to write a long one but I feel its necessary, hope this helps.

They do not offer free breakfast, but it is available and quite good. A modest selection of fruit, bread, yogurt, juice and of course coffee. There are a few cafes close by if you want that option. Rooms are small - typical for this type of hotel. It was adequate though - we didn't spend any time in there anyway - after all, we were in Paris. Anyway the room had a flat screen to save space and a safe for your valuables. It had enough room for our packs and the bathroom was very clean a well appointed. One very notable item was the shower. It was an awesome full body shower with about 5 nozzles running the length of the wall. A fun shower to use.Overall the staff was great, no problems, they were all helpful and accommodating.

Hotel is in a reasonable area, next to Est train station, but it is a more residential area. Can walk to Montmartre without too much trouble, and the Republique/Grand Boulevard areas. A few interesting characters in the area as you'd expect near 2 of the main train stations (Est and Nord).

The room was on the small side but very clean and had everything I could need. I also appreciated having CNN Europe as one of the TV stations available since it is in English and I could catch up with what was going on in the world. The only minor issue is that the shower was extremely small (2.5' x 3' x 6.5'). Since I am petite, it wasn't that much of a problem for me but it could definitely be a problem for others.

All of them were really friendly, spoke good English and always wanted to help The Rooms: I have stayed in alot of hotels in my time and this was defiantly the smallest. All very nice and clean but yes small. Unfortunately there was no English speaking tv which while not a problem it would have been great to have one channel to watch in the morning such as cnn. But hey you get what you pay for. We paid \u00a360 per night for 3 nights. Someone did mention this in another review and that is the walls are thin. I don't think the French bloke in the next room was happy that we and my g/f had booked a romantic weekend away......we had fun anyway! Location: When you leave the hotel you can turn left (towards Gar d'lest or right). perfect to get to the station. But if you are looking for a restaurant or a nice walk go right. Me and my g/f were amazed it was like two totally different parts of the city despite only being one street away. When you turn right at the end of the road there is a restaurant and a cafe opposite each other. Apologies but i can't remember the name of either. However the cafe served us an excellent lunch and the atmosphere in there was excellent. Across from here is a restaurant where we went on our final night. I searched for hours on the internet to find the perfect place in Paris to go on our last night and it was at the end of the road. The food was excellent and we had a few drinks. also. Price wise it probably costs just as much as any decent restaurant in Paris. We took 500 euros with us for the weekend. When it was gone it was gone. We travelled around on the tube which is very efficient and cheap. Get a carnet! - Basically this gives you ten tickets which we found was just enough for the weekend. Don\u2019t eat and drink near the tourist attractions they just overcharge you. Find places to eat and drink even a 5/10 min walk away and you find the prices fall.

So, if you get assigned room 118 - request a reassignment to ANY other room, trust me. We had no room to open our suitcases.

The room and bathroom were definitely compact but the furniture appeared to be fairly new as was the bathroom. Everything worked and you could open all the doors. The stairs are fairly narrow and steep and I didn't see the lift so perhaps not the best place to stay if you aren't fairly mobile. Breakfast was fine - fruit juice, fruit salad, bread, cold meats, cheese, bread, croissants and pastries plus coffee or tea. The breakfast room did get busy and we had to wait a few minutes for a table on the Saturday morning. The staff were helpful - they have a lap top you can borrow for internet access and there was a luggage room where you can leave bags after you checked out. The hotel is a little out of the centre but very close to Metro Gare de l'Est from with good access into the centre. In the other direction the Canal St Martin makes a pleasant stroll and has several cafes and bars - it must be pretty lively in the summer. We had a drink at L'Atmosphere on Rue des Recollects which was pleasant (and the food served on other tables looked good).
