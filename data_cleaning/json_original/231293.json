Sorry. The hotel was in a fabulous location and while it is very basic, it was everything we needed. It is only a 2 1/2 star so don't go expected luxury. The room was clean and warm and breakfast was adequate. There were cereals, juices, fresh breads etc. Rooms are of a good size for the price you pay. I hear the single rooms are very small though, so I would recommend upgrading. The lift is not a plus - very small - as are most lifts we saw in Rome. You will most likely have to use the stairs so not ideal if you are on a higher floor. I personally enjoyed being forced t exercise after all that yummy pizza from across the road. Yes the hotel is dated but in my opinion the hotel is very good value.

The hotel itself seemed to me nice, but only until the time when I entered the room. The furniture is shabby, the TV remote control didn't function, the view out of the window was tubes, cigarette stubs and garbage . The wallpapers became obviously dark with time. It was impossible to stay long in the bathroom, as due to absence of shower walls, window or any other means of ventilation the water that remained after I took the shower remained on the floor and made the smell damp. + I had smoking neighbours. The ceiling in the corridor of the 1st floor leaked. The breakfast is poor, don't expect a ham or a decent juice and coffee. The hotel is closed from 2 AM till 5 AM. And every time you leave the room, you have to hand in the key at the reception. And that is why I used to take all my belongings with me, as there was no safe in the room and I was suspicios of the receptionists remembering all the guests. The receptioninsts (an italian man who works in the morning and a palestinian man who works in the evening, unfortunately I don't know their names) are very nice and helpful - THANK YOU GUYS, YOU SAVE THE EXPERIENCE ONE MAY GET OF THIS PLACE!

The air conditioning wasn't working on the first night, which can be an experiene in July. In that room there was couple of other problems. It seemed that the finishing of the deco was partly left undone. For example some panels in the walls were not attached and they kept falling down. Also the here was no other room available for the that night, so we had to wait until next day to get a new room fixed. Anyways, after getting the new room next day we were happy with a cool room that was also a bit bigger than the one day before. Air conditioning worked perfectly and we felt that it was enough of complaining for now. To be honest there would have been lots of things to improve in the second room as well. The floor was cracked in the room and the shower was flooding on the bathroom's floor. There was no other way to prevent it except putting towels on the floor before going to take a shower. We felt that those were minor problems compared to the lack of air conditioning. Room tidiness was in good levels. Housekeeping took care of changing the towels and sheets and cleaning up the room every day. They had also put automatically extra towels in the bathroom to prevent flooding. OItherwise we had mixed feelings what comes to the staff. Changing the room required some serious conversations with the staff. No discounts even of the first night were offered, and one receptionist ended up not even saying hellos after we dared to ask such a thing. Well, after couple of thank yous of the room change brought a some sort of a smile back to his face. Overall the friendliness of the staff seemed to be changing by person to person. The negative enquiries were normally answered by \"it's not my fault/responsibility, ask someone else\" -attitude. Breakfast was a bit below standard as well. No fresh things whatsoever. Just same dry bread, cakes and cereal with coffee and juice every day. However, we were still happy with the city and had lovely time looking the sights and experiencing the restaurants outside of the hotel. The location of the hotel was perfect. But in Rome it is very easy to get around, and it wouldn't even really matter if you lived close to the Spanish Steps or somewhere else.

I am a very budget-minded traveller, and although I had read some rather negative reviews about this hotel, I decided to try it out because of its location (a step away from Via Nazionale, and close to the Spanish Steps, and just about everything else), and also because there were some positive reviews (regarding the location). This hotel does not present well, but if you do not care about aesthetics, then this is no problem. For me, I didn't care. I began to care, when I found out that the elevator (which could hold only one person at a time and his/her suitcase) only went to the third floor, and my room happened to be on the fourth. One elevator ride, and a trip up two flights of stairs, I ended up in front of the door to my room. I opened the door, eager with anticipation to throw my exhausted self unto the bed awaiting me, only to discover that I could not see because of the darkness of the room. After locating and turning on the light, I saw my room in its full glory. It was small, but I expected that. It was narrow, I expected that too. It was truly dark, even with the light on. This I did not expect. I saw there was a standing closet, which had one of its doors missing. I saw that there was a desk with a television on top of it, but no chair. I saw that there was a window (and thanked the gods.) I saw that there was a long horizontal mirror above the desk. I walked to the window, and opened it. I was pleasantly surprised by the view of the patio and an outline of the city of Rome. I turned around to face my room, and sighed. I was in Rome. I looked to my left and saw a smaller room, which I assumed to be the bathroom. Turning on the light, I saw that it too was very small. I expected this. I saw some exposed wires where there should have been a mirror above the sink. I did not expect this. I also did not expect the loud noise that was produced when I turned on the light. I sighed again, and thought to myself, \"Well, at least, I am in Rome.\" I decided to refreshen my make-up, but as it was getting pretty dark, I decided to find the light source by the mirror, so that I could actually see what I was doing. How foolish I was to think that there would actually be light. I went downstairs to the desk attendant to ask if I could have a lamp of some sort to provide the light needed for me to see, and was told no. I sighed again, at least I was in Rome. I decided I didn't need light for a week and would just do my best at the start of the day. The days went on like this, and only got worse. I recognized from the first night that someone else had slept in the bed, but I expected this. What I did not expect was to find the many, many hairs left behind by the person who had last occupied the bed however. I did a lot of sighing. Over the course of the week, I received fresh towels, but the room was never swept. The dust accumalating in the room was only made worse by the staff's insistence on keeping my window open, even after I closed it. Also, I found out to my dismay that I was not allowed to have male visitors as a single woman, because of some belief that I may be prostituting myself (nevermind the fact that I am gay). I was told by an attendant that this was a law in Italy. I had never heard of this before. So, my poor friend (whom I had come to visit me during my visit was told to wait outside while I came downstairs, and was not allowed to help me bring some shopping bags upstairs after I returned. This was all very disappointing, but who was I to interfere with the law of Italy. I sighed again, and decided never return to this hotel. It also did not help that I was frequently talked about by staff, who referred to me as \"la negra,\" to other people even when I was in their presence (the thought was that I didn't understand Italian at all). So, my advice: if you happen to be a Black woman travelling alone in Rome, who does not like dirty hotels, and ill-mannered staff, then do not stay at Hotel Zara.

We paid 150 euro per night. Not cheap in my book, especially for what we got. Reading some of the more recent reviews made me wonder if we stayed in the same hotel.. The booking confirmation said we had booked a room with city views and a king size bed. When we checked in we were given a room with a view of the run down back of the adjacent building, and two single beds made up as a double. We weren't that concerned, but when we queried it we were told that no rooms had a city view, and all of them had the same beds... so basically that the confirmation was a complete fabrication. The room was not big, but wasn't cramped either. It had next to no soundproofing.. you could hear people in the hall as if there was no door. The bathroom was very dated, but reasonably clean. When I asked if the airconditioning in the room worked, I was told that we weren't supposed to use it, and that the only way I could control the temperature was by turning off the heat if we were too hot. There was no way of cooling other than opening the window. Someone else here commented on the beds and they were spot on... they were so hard it was almost like sleeping in the floor.. I swear I actually had bruises. If we weren't so tired from walking all day I probably wouldn't have slept at all. The breakfast room was very pleasant and bright, but the breakfast itself was pretty ordinary.. we both laughed at the processed cheese slices that were put out (still in their plastic wrappers). We sat down for breakfast on the first morning but didn't stay. We found the breakfast at the bar around the corner on Via Nazionale was much better, and less than 10 euro for two people. The same bar makes great pizza and cocktails incidentally. I can't remember the name but it's near the supermarket and bus stop. What took the cake though, was when, on the morning we were checking out, we got up to shower at about 6:45am.

Approx 1meter square it had everything including a handy light switch and hair dryer within reach of the shower which you were beneath whilst stood at the hand basin!(you actually pulled a plastic curtain around yourself to contain the spray)This rather inauspicious start to our stay however must not put you off this hotel. The price for a superb location was very very good value, the room was spotlessly clean, it was very quiet at night, the large double bed was comfortable,the room was beautifully warm,as was the water in the basin and the shower.The fridge had a good range of drinks at reasonable prices, the telly worked fine,the staff were always pleasant and the cold buffet breakfast was adequate taken in a lovely bright room. Shame the bar was not open at night but I assume it was because we were out of season. I would recommend without hesitation this hotel as a place to stay. We walked everywhere from this hotel and don't forget we are in our 60's and got back to the Zara every night tired but happy. One of the most interesting places to eat is just down the road called Esti Esti Esti. Down a dark back street at the end -look it up and enjoy!Another one to enjoy is La Taverna dei Monti in the via del Boschetto-again just down the road. Beautifully cooked food and reasonable prices. We saw all the sights in our 4 day stay but felt we only scratched the surface of this wonderful vibrant city.We hope to return to chuck a coin in the Trevi!", "Date": "March 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "DublinIrelandOlive", "ReviewID": "UR4617695", "Content": "We booked a four night stay at hotel Zara from the 17th of Feb for four nights.

The plan was to explore the Eternal city together over a long weekend. So when she suggested Hotel Zara, I was somewhat apprehensive because of the multitude of average or negative reviews on this site. And furthermore, the pictures on the website suggested a hotel a little too grand for my taste - and all at 90 euros per night? Mmmmm. But we went ahead regardless - as the location seemed superb. And in a city such as Roma, a hotel is merely somewhere to sleep and to possibly breakfast.. right? Wrong. Over the course of the weekend, I learnt that you can reliably measure the quality of any 3-star hotel by the extras the staff will provide to create the experience you've travelled there for. Especially on a weekend such as ours where excessive rain threatened the banks of the Tiber! Having walked in the rain from Termini (<15mins), I was pleasantly surprised by the warmth of Gino, at the reception - who, luckily for me, spoke perfect English and informed me that my friend had arrived early and was allowed to wait for me in our room. There was lift to the third floor where both our bedroom and adjoining bathroom were spacious, heated and clean. The effort that had gone into the decor was obvious - the type of room one could feel comfortable in during any season. Over the course of the weekend, I noted many small things that were done to make our stay a more pleasant one. Example..? The staff were flexible enough to bring us a late breakfast in bed, without hesitation. My friend had the onset of flu, and I was informed this service was not the norm..! Even having a corkscrew at hand -- a sign of an experienced staff prepared for any eventuality! On my last night, the weather having improved somewhat, I took a stroll down the road to the Spanish steps - my friend had already left. But this centrality proved so important for us during the weekend. My last stay in Roma was at the 4-star Starhotel in San Pietro (evidently, a hotel I decided not to return to). Next time, I will return to Hotel Zara - with it's staff an asset of which they should be proud. I had asked the hotel to arrange a lift to the airport. When I arrived downstairs at 07:25 with my luggage, I was surprised to be told that my driver was early and waiting for me in the dining room. We had an espresso together and on the way to Ciampino, with his beautiful music selection, he struggled in English (and in very slow Italian) to communicate the important sites I might have missed, the traffic into Roma on a Monday morning... and even how he is learning Japanese from his wife. So if you're looking for a 3-star hotel with a 5-star service, (where the staff actually remember you by name), I'd say look no further, and remember.. you're paying a decent rate by Roman standards for one of the best locations and by far the best hotel service that this well-travelled student has experienced.

The room was fairly clean. The one bright spot was the staff - they were extremely helpful and friendly. The dining room is lovely, complete with chandeliers, and the breakfast was very good. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a single room. Friends of mine had a double room, and while being small, it was adequate.

The stair carpet was stained and there were wires hanging out of the walls where the light fittings should have been. Our room was not much better. It was small, dark and dingy, there were dirty marks on the walls and the wallpaper was peeling off. Only two of the three lights worked and on the first night one of those broke! Beyond the bedroom was a small hallway which had a cupboard containing a filthy blanket and a window with a loose electrical wire hanging outside it. The bathroom was small, the toilet was not clean, there were electircal wires loose on the windows and the mirror which should have had three lights in it had one bulb which didn't work, one fitting with no bulb in it and one hole where a fitting should have been.
