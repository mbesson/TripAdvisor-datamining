Since this was not allowable the staff very kindly offered an upgrade to the cottages, which we felt was more than compensating. Ours had the best view and the rooms were clean and pleasant. But no phone, and this is important. The bad - it was Saturday night and the club near the cottages played non-stop pounding music until 5 am, the last cars and motorcycles left at 5:30. I only slept from 9:30 until 1 am when the pounding woke me up. This is not the nature experience that we had received the night before in another hotel. We were told security guards are around - that was not our experience aound the cottages. We only saw a few cars parked that next morning from those that stayed at this hotel. We got the same impression as prevous reviewers. We should have read them more carefully. Never again. I will say one of the staff left a message wanting to interview us as to our harrowing experience. When I called the number, the person hung up and I tried a half of dozen times and left my message and contact information. Never a return call. I then decided to write this review after giving them the benefit of contacting me but no response. I know there are some very nice people that work there - in the restaurant and at the desk but this was not what we were looking for.......", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fenwick Island, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cSitting in my prison room\u201d", "Author": "leisuresusie", "ReviewID": "UR124998698", "Content": "I have not been in prison.

I was there for a week, using the hotel as a base to explore Puerto Rico. I was dissapointed that I had to ask 2xs for the room to be cleaned and during the week \"breakfast included\" was a small ham and cheese sandwich and coffee. I am ok with continental breakfast but this was pushing it. One of the days, they forgot breakfast altogether. Also, if you are planning to sleep on the weekend, dont expect much rest with the club playing blasting music until after 4am!!
