I called the reception only to be told they couldnt do anything as it was already too late and they were full. Third my room was on the second floor and there was a dance club on the 1st floor which is opens till 3:30 in the morning. I couldnt sleep @ all and it was really annoying especially when i have to wake up @ 6 in the morning. When i complained the next day they said the room hadnt been in use for a while so therefore had cockroaches in.. how disgusting... and the staff werent ready to move my room but when i argued that i work in hotel myself they moved me to the 3rd floor but still could hear all the noise from the club. The staff would not move my parents room either so i had to stay on the 3rd floor when my parents were on 1st for entire journey. Breakfast had no option other than indian buffet everyday.

The service in the hotel was always very friendly and our standard room on the fourth floor was quiet and comfortable. I can imagine that in the floor just above the disco earplugs would be required. The breakfast in the Indian restaurant was tasty (if you like Indian food) and had both veg and non-veg alternatives.

This was not our choice but referred by our travel agent. As such I made a quick search about the hotel reviews on this site. I was worried after reading the comments! Anyway the travel agent recommended it and also as our intention was to explore Dubai and not spend much time in the hotel we decided to go ahead with it. I must say I do not agree with some of the earlier reviews, as we did not hear any noise from the Disco and slept well (we were on the 3rd floor)! It had all facilities that is usually offered in these type of hotels. The room was good, clean and it remained that way throughout our stay. The breakfast of course was not that good as it was almost the same menu everyday without any variation. The staff was friendly and helped us with arranging various sight seen tours. Wifi facility is there however it is not free of charge. The best thing about the hotel is the location!!!!! It is 5 minutes away to the nearest Metro station from there you could go to all Malls starting from Iban Batuta, Mall of Emirates (where Ski Dubai/Snow park is), Burj Kalifa/Dubai Mall (where the ice skating, acquarium and sound & light water show happen) if you purchase an unlimited day pass costing 16 AED. Also the water taxi station to cross the Dubai creek (on the other side you get the famous gold souk, spice souk & perfume souk with a fare of 1 AED) is also 5 minutes walk. A branch of Careefour Supermarket is also in the neighborhood. The Dubai museum, a film theater (mostly screen Tamil) and shops (wholesale /retail with bargain prices) for computers, phones, etc and many eating places are all around the hotel. The Ambassador Hotel (of the same group) is a hop step away and they have a variety of pubs and a swimming pool. The hotel even allowed us a very late checkout so that we could shop more till we were dropped at the airport. It is about 30 minutes away from the airport.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huber Heights, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cFlesh Pot\u201d", "Author": "Star-time", "ReviewID": "UR122285371", "Content": "I had 3 days to spend in Dubai before being able to fly home from Afghanistan. I'd read about all the Islamic rules about not being able to hold hands with your wife in public, or kissing her on the cheek, so the infestation of hookers at the hotel was a bit of a shock. I was feeling ill the first night and couldn't sleep. The thump, thump, thump of the disco on the 1st floor, I was on the 4th, didn't help, but I'm already used to incoming rocket attacks so it wasn't too bad. Anyway, I hadn't had a stiff drink (still didn't since the hotel's drinks were watered-down) for 7 months, so I thought I'd get a drink at the hotel bar (TGIT) on the ground floor. Well before I could get my drink order in, this Asian woman (admittedly pretty) was instantly at my side. I looked and immediately knew why she was there, and it wasn't because of my boyish good looks. I ignored her... with her ample breasts displayed like a Peacock. A venerable sea of wobbly flesh. I received my watery screwdriver and walked around with the hooker sticking to me like a heat-seeking missle. I couldn't shake her. I found a single seat and planted myself there. She just leaned-in with that smile stuck to her face. I said, \"Look, I'm not feeling well and just came down for a drink to help me sleep. I don't want any company.\" She said OK and left. But that wasn't the end of it. Within a minute another hooker, not quite as pretty as the last, came and offered her services. I sent her away, and along comes another! It was like they sent in the A-Team, the B-Team, C-Team, and then they sent the D-Team! This hooker looked straight out of a WWII propaganda cartoon, complete with crazy buck-teeth and coke-bottom glasses! And she was mean! She said, \"Bar closed now! Why you come here and not take girl!?\" I was mad at this point, I told her I wasn't feeling well, thought I'd have a drink, and \"Is that alright with you?!\" She said, Oh, you stay this hotel? So sorry.\" So the hotel is alright for the money, and very centrally located. The staff is friendly, and the Indian Resturant is very nice. The included breakfast is nice too. They even offered to make me eggs and bacon when they only had Indian food out for breakfast. I recommend staying here if you're on a budget, but stay away from the bar and night club if you don't want a hooker, and bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. If you're used to helicopters and C-130s and incoming rocket impacts, you'll be fine.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Udaipur, Rajasthan, India", "Title": "\u201czero amenities, delicious breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Sunil P", "ReviewID": "UR122166190", "Content": "It was its location in meena bazaar in old Dubai that made us choose this hotel.
