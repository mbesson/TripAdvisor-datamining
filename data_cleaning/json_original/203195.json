As you come out Fiumucino Airport terminal down on the right there are a row of express buses straight to the city centre. Buy a ticket (4 euros when we went) and take the 30 minute journey to Termini (the central metro station in Rome.) 2. Enter the station and from the machine on the wall buy a one euro BIT ticket and get on the blue metro line to Rebibia. The ticket means that you can travel on public transport (bus and train) for the next 75 minutes. 3. Arrive at Rebibia. Come out the station and cross the road left 200 metres to a bank of bus stops. You will need the 444. 4. After a 5 minute journey (one major left turn on the way) you get out when the bus turns again right by a small arcade of shops. Just outside Pizza Rustica. 4. You are now a 10 to 15 minutes walk from the hotel.5. Walk back 30 metres to the main road where the bus turned off. And turn right. Walk up the long road.Eventually Pass an antiques market on the opposite side , and up to a cross roads . You now start seeing signs to the hotel. At the big cross roads take a right for 2 minutes and a right at the second petrol station (Total). The big \"Hotel\" sign beckons you.

The bus does take quite a big detour through an estate so don't panic. If this hotel was closer it would be perfect, it's only (minor) issue is the distance from central Rome. I would definitly reccommend this hotel if you don't mind the commute. We found that the commute allowed us to see how the people of Rome really live - the locals were very helpful when we looked a little puzzled looking for a bus stop etc. There is a Lidl store across the main road where the bus stop is which is quite handy if you want to get some cheap drinks - we got a six pack of bottled water for 76 cents which saved us loads of money as the stands in Central Rome charge 3-4 Euros a bottle.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joensuu, Finland", "Title": "\u201cReasonable price, great service!\u201d", "Author": "Jarrrtsa", "ReviewID": "UR118096136", "Content": "We were very pleased with the service of this hotel.

We chose this hotel based on good reviews, only to find out when we arrived in Rome that we had made a terrible choice, as it was costing us 30EURO each way per day to get to the city centre and back by taxi. Yes, we could have used buses, but they all seems to be backwards as in going completely the wrong way. Asked locals that understood English for directions to the Vatican City and other attractions, but they gave us the wrong directions and several people didn't even know what the Vatican City was, which I find very strange! Anyway, back to the hotel....... As we walked in it smelt of cigars and other unpleasant scents. The man on reception who happened to be the Hotel Manager, was very unwelcoming to me and my boyfriend, as spoke to us like we were dirt on his shoe. He checked us in, whilst on the phone to somebody, didn't sound business related either, so probably was a personal call. He was not proffesional at all. When we asked for info on attractions he was very vague and said \"what do you want to go there for?\" (at this point - we were talking about the Colleseum). He asked for our passports, which at that point we found strange. However, later on we found out that hoteliers to keep them for a few mins to get details. He had our passports for at least 45 mins, and when we asked for them back he was reluctant to give them to us. Finally, after an hour we got them back after many sly comments from the Manager and bad humour. He then made comments to me in front of my boyfriend saying i was Beautiful and he said i can have my passport back if I gave him a kiss on the cheek. (had this been anywhere else - i would have taken it as a joke and seen the funny side, but he was serious). We went out for dinner, then later returned to the hotel to find he was waiting outside for us and said \" i was wondering what happened to you and what time you would be back\". We both found this very strange. He was over-friendly, but weird too and his joked lacked humour and came across as sleezy. Went to hotel room, and cried my eyes out to my boyfriend because i felt unsafe, i wasnt sure if we would wake up the following morning. He seemed so dodgy, and the fact our door wouldnt lock made me feel very uneasy. The next day, without the manager seeing us, we checked out and went to another Hotel (which was very nice). We had such high expectations of this hotel, but it wasnt all its cracked up to be - as it is too far out from any attractions, no shops, hardly any - well not even 2 bus stops, and it is very misleading. Also, rooms were nicely decorated and had a balcony - but it was dirty, musty and the bed was dirty. We left this hotel very disappointed and underwhelmed. I actually couldnt believe what we had experienced on our first night of our first holiday together. This hotel ruined our whole trip. There is more i could say about this hotel, but i think i have said enough for now.

The cleaningstaff was very attended to every day check the room with new towels etc. and also helpfull when I had forgot my key without even asking her. A little minus was the breakfast.

We can only recomend them to make that happen. The area around the hotel is quiet and okay, but in august most of the restaurant is cloosed, becuase the italian are having their holiday at this time. This is a huge problem toogether with the distance to the center because you are stucked out there in the evening to eat at the same restaurant every night (La Mucca, which is an okay restaurant, but not that speciel so you want to eat there more than once.). Otherwise you have to stay in the center all day and evening because you just dont take the trip twice a day. To much value time will be wasted. We will recomend the owners of the hotel to try to work together with these restaurants so that not all of them are on vacation at the same time. So in a short way - the hotel is nice an living up to their stars and will be perfect for turist traveling in there own car.
