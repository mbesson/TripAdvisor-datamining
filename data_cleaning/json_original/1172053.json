Highlights: pool was neat but pictures make it look much larger than it really is. There are actually three pools, one \"lap pool\" which is a little more than one lane wide, a \"hot tub\" and a \"cold tub\". Note that there's no change room on the pool level (that we could see) so you may be left with a dripping wet bathing suit all the way back to your room. Hotel location is great - Convention Centre is right across the street (with the multi-coloured glass windows)with a few restaurants such as Subway (the sandwich shop) and a convenience store. Metro is only a block or two - no more than a five minute - walk away. For some reason, Mapquest/Googlemaps seemed to make everything appear much further away than it really is. Not as great: we stayed in a two bedroom suite, with a king bed in one room and a pullout couch in the other. King bed was great, however, not clear that an adult would be comfortable sleeping on the pullout, think of a design with a metal support bar in the middle of it. Parking was only available by valet ($24 per day), and they took 20 minutes to get our car. Not sure if parking across the street was cheaper? Also note that in our room, it only had a shower (no bathtub). This wasn't a problem for us, but maybe for others. Note: if travelling to Montreal for first time, and if you're coming from the West, note that quite a few (all?) exits off the highway to downtown are on the left (not right) hand side, so be prepared!

We almost booked a hotel in the heart of Old Montreal, and we're really glad we didn't! We took a stroll through Old Montreal on Sunday afternoon, and it felt really dead - many of the shops and restaurants were actually closed. I was really surprised, because I had been there in the summer before and it was incredibly vibrant and bustling. It has an outdoor skating rink, so I thought Old Montreal would be just as busy as the summer. Or that shops would be open at the very least! Back to the hotel - the pool with the glass bottom was fun, but it was jam-packed with kids every time we went. The pool had an attendant, which was nice, but the attendants never asked the kids (or parents) to refrain from doing cannonballs into the pool, which got to be rather annoying for those getting splashed in the adjacent hot tub! I know that makes me sound old and curmudgeonly, but running around a pool doing haphazard cannonballs seems potentially dangerous, not just disruptive. The gym was great - clean and well-equipped. The room service was prompt and excellent. The morning breakfast buffet at The Gazette, on the other hand, was over-crowded and over-priced. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a seat at the bar (not even a table!) and apparently we were lucky - the line to get in snaked all the way out the door when we left. At $22 a person, we would have been better off ordering off the menu. The buffet was ok, but I think $12 would have been a more reasonable price considering the selection. Loved the free wi-fi and in-room coffee. One minor housekeeping gripe: I opened the sealed shower cap and found it had already been used, and was full of soap! That was gross.

The hotel has a small pool, looks good though, but no spa, that was a downside for us, as we were looking to attend the spa. We ate dinner, lunch and breakfast in the hotel (our breakfast was included), dinner was just okay, and lunch was just okay, but I did enjoy the breakfast. Overall, the hotel is located perfectly in Montreal, with old Montreal right behind it, everything is walking distance, so the hotel does earn some points for that. Overall though, I've stayed at The Arc Hotel in Ottawa for $150 and the room was just as nice, or I've been to the Sheraton, and the room was just as nice but cheaper at the Sheraton. Basically, I would rate this hotel just \"good\", but that wasn't an option, and the hotel is better than average, so it left me to rate it with very good.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLovely stay at Le Westin\u201d", "Author": "tdot888", "ReviewID": "UR123309346", "Content": "Le Westin is in a great location in Old Montreal.

We were upgraded from a standard double to a junior suite on the 20th floor. Lobby was beautiful, modern with great artwork. Handy info screens displaying flight details in and out of Montreal airport. The room was very generously sized. Junior suite included an entrance room with flat screen TV, couch, chair, coffee table and full length mirror. After walking through this room you were in the main bedroom, with another large full size mirror, wardrobe with safe and robes, another large flat screen TV, drawers and working desk in nice dark wood, another mirror above desk, two lounge chairs in front of gorgeous big window, two queen sized beds and the beautiful large bathroom. Our friends who were in the standard double room had an exact same room of generous size, comfort and standard - only difference was the extra entrance lounge room in the suite. There was no mini bar and the fridge was empty, something I really apprecaited. Of course you could call up and ask for mini bar items, the list and prices were supplied, however I much prefer having an empty fridge for my own items to be stored. View from the room was lovely, overlooking the rooftops of Old Montreal and the river - just gorgeous at sunset. The beds - AMAZING. soooo comfortable and with black out curtains, you could sleep for days! The bathroom - just gorgeous, spacious, heavenly shower certainly was just that with the two shower heads you could adjust to suit and so much room. Cleanliness of the whole room was exceptional. No dust anywhere at all, really noticed how clean and well kept everything was. The decor as well was modern, sleek and calming. Just loved it. Free wifi included with room worked perfectly the whole stay. Room service tasted fine, service from everyone in the hotel was lovely. Courtesy calls to ensure our stay was going well and if there was anything we required. We asked for concierge to recommend a hair salon as we were there for a wedding and they organised and booked with someone local, that was just fabulous. Also asked for info re: where to dine, etc and they were great in providing maps and information for us. Location - it is in the business end of town, near Old Montreal. So very easy access through the hotel to Old Montreal which is a gorgeous part of the city to wander around. If you are looking for shopping, restaurants then it is a bit of a walk to the main streets, however only approx 10 minutes, so over all a good location. Gym facilities were excellent, one of the biggest and most modern gym areas in a hotel I have seen with comp water, plenty of machines and a great view! Upon arriving home received thank you email and survey to complete to provide feedback on our stay, which was welcomed and continued the theme that this hotel really makes you feel like they care about the individual and their time at the property.

I've almost never booked into a $200+ hotel and not had a bath - the only time was when I could only get an accessible room and it was clear when I was booking, and it didn't matter to me. On this trip, this was a minor frustration (yes, I could have asked for a new room, but this would have been a nuisance), but if my 3.5 year old son had been with me (the original plan) this would have been a disaster, as he's still terrified of showers and a bath is part of his bedtime routine, as it is the case for many, many kids. I gather the Westin folks feel big showers are preferred but I really think it needs to be clearer - I read the fine print of my confirmation email (received almost a month after I booked) and I see it's alluded to there, but it's not totally obvious. I'm sure we are not the only ones with small children for whom this would be an issue. I would have appreciated it to be highlighted, as I think it's reasonably unusual, based on our staying in hotels 6+ times per year for business and pleasure.

At check-in, I was told I could not be further upgraded--Club upgrades were limited to SPG Platinum members. So, my three night stay I paid for an upgrade to a better room which I would have received at no cost otherwise. I asked about the cost to upgrade to Club Floor, and forked over an extra $60/night to do so. So, from an original CAA/AAA rate of $175/night, I paid $265/night for a room and service in a hotel which was lackluster. As a previous reviewer described, the premium room was unappealing. It was a 1-bedroom suite, but the living room had no windows and therefore we never utilized that room. The bedroom was average size in my opinion--probably smaller than the standard size bedrooms elsewhere in the hotel because of the space taken away to create the separate enclosed living room. Bathroom was nice enough, but lacked a bathtub in which I would have enjoyed soaking during this stay. Hotel was very quiet and empty during the three-night stay (Sun-Wed). As a busy conference hotel, it might be fine, but even when empty we felt the hotel was impersonal and we were anonymous as guests (even though our faces were familiar to some of the staff day after day). Location was convenient to Vieux Montreal and to downtown areas--probably the best merit of the property. Club floor privileges were a complete waste of money and rather pathetic. The Club Lounge is essentially defunct. Except for cold beverages available in the refrigerators in the Lounge, there was no other food/beverage service available in the lounge. For breakfast, everyone is sent to the restaurant on the ground floor. Buffet breakfast there was merely adequate. We ate each morning around 9:30 a.m. and consistently found the hot foods barely warm if even warm. Food quality and variety wasn't anything exceptional either, with the noted exception of very good croissants. I certainly wouldn't want to pay $21+ for the buffet otherwise. From 5-7 p.m., you can return to the ground floor restaurant/bar for either tapas or a glass of wine/beer (take your pick) with the SPG coupon provided. The crab cakes we ordered one night were awful. The calamari was fine, as was the coconut shrimp. The only thing that lived up to Starwood expectation, in my opinion, was the typical Starwood quality bed/mattress which provided a comfortable night sleep--that is once we removed all feather products from the bedroom! Otherwise, this was a completely forgettable, albeit expensive, hotel experience.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto , Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the cost\u201d", "Author": "PoppyToronto", "ReviewID": "UR119569911", "Content": "Planned a weekend away with my husband.

The company ended up booking 20 rooms and I was in one of them. I asked a front desk staff whether I would get a stay credit given that it's a group booking. I was reassured that I would (but I won't get any points which was fine by me). When I checked out, I asked the staff to make sure I will stay the stay credit and she said yes!! Of course the credit was not applied. I called the starwood platinum line and was told that because it's a group booking, I had to call the hotel to sort out the credit. I called the hotel and the staff told me she would get someone to call me back. A week later, no one called me and I called the hotel again to leave another message.

But now add in that I felt some other things were also off given that this is a Westin. There were stains on the carpets and at the bottom of the bed. I happened to eat lunch in the restaurant after brunch. Crumbs were everywhere. Dishes were still out. A few flies were joining me for lunch. Annoying right. Whatever about the flies but the whole time I sat there, I didn't see anyone take out a carpet cleaner to get up the crumbs. And finally - I wasn't a fan of the bathroom layout. The door was extra large and when opened into the bathroom, caused me to have to stand slightly off center from the sink. Oh wait - they charged me for valet parking when I didn't even bring a car. Sure they corrected it right away. So that's it for the annoying. Otherwise, the staff were friendly enough. I got to check out late which I loved. The bed - of course - wonderful! Spacious room.

There was no view per se, but the rooms did get good natural light, and were soundproof. My in-laws staying in the room next door said that they did not hear our two boys making any noise at all. The bathroom had a huge shower (no bathtub), good water pressure, and the level of luxury that we have come to expect from the Westin brand. The beds were comfortable, albeit with feather pillows that were a tad too soft, and the sheets were crisp and clean. Every day when we returned from a day of sight seeing, the rooms were immaculately made. The WiFi connection was fast and included in the room rate. The Pool There is an indoor swimming pool - one main pool and two smaller plunge pools with hot and cold water. The main pool wasn't tremendously big, but it was big enough for my 3 and 4 year olds. The pool area had high ceilings, lots of natural light, and plenty of floaties for the boys. Food - Breakfast/Room Service We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant each morning. Buffet breakfast was included in our room rate for the adults, and kids ate for free as they were under the age of 5. There was a decent selection of hot and cold foods, lots of cereal, and plenty of fresh fruit. Service was always excellent. We also ordered room service for one dinner during our trip. It took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive. Selection was OK, and the food quality/quantity was pretty good for room service.

The valets were also very fast about bringing up our car, and when my boys accidentally left their toys behind in the vehicle, they gladly went down to the parking garage and brought up the wayward toys. The only thing that this hotel needs to work on is the friendliness of the staff. to be clear, no one was outright rude.

The bed was very comfortable, and with the blackout curtains, made for a wonderful night sleep. The couch and chair were hard and not very comfortable; the cushions were made of some fabric that kept with the modern theme, but was rough and too firm. There was an in-room safe, which was located in a cabinet down by the floor. Not only did that make it inconvenient, but it was very hard to see the instructions and numbers. The hotel has a bar/restaurant that serves meals, but you should go into Old Montreal to Olive and Gourmando or to other near-by espresso and salad shops, rather than eat in what is really their bar. However, it was nice for a drink before heading out to dinner, and to watch some sports on TV. The staff was friendly and helpful when approached with questions, but there was no information in the room to help tourist types figure out the best way to tackle the city. There is a museum and travel ticket which saves a lot of money for families who are in the area for a few days...but you need to ask. Montreal is a great place to explore for a few days, and the Westin is a good choice for the money.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. John's, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, great room\u201d", "Author": "drmtbc", "ReviewID": "UR117007875", "Content": "My company has discount rates at 3 fine hotels in downtown Montreal - I randomly selected this one over the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth and the Sheraton Centre, and was delighted I did!

You ask \"Why did I call three times?\" Well, I just didn't trust the people I spoke with. During the third conversation, the woman at the front desk assured me that they would put the crib in our room prior to arrival. That was more than I could have asked for, but it also seemed like they were promising too much by stating that they would do that. When we checked in at the front desk, I reminded them that I needed a crib. The person at the front desk said that she saw the record where I called three times to confirm. And she said \"oh I hope that there is one left for you because we are out of cribs.\" OMG! So she said that we should get one since I called ahead of time so many times and that it should be in our room. Sure enough, we got there and no crib was in the room. I had to call the front desk AGAIN (fifth time) to remind them to bring it up. How annoying! One day when it was raining outside, we called down to get our car. They said ok we will have it out for you and didn't specify a time. After 40 minutes, still no car. It was busy down there, but really? 40 minutes??? So we cancelled the car and walked.

I booked the Westin because I expected top quality and excellent concierge services. Unfortunately, on our first day we were given bad information by the concierge that caused us to waste time and miss opportunities. I asked about day tours on the water of the Harbor and to Quebec City. I was told there were none, to my surprise! I pressed the concierge and learned there was a Ferry to the small island where the Biosphere and Casino are located, but that \"the Metro was much easier\". While I would agree that that the Metro is the best way to see the Biosphere, the information regarding day cruises was completely wrong!! 2 days later we learned that there were 2 day cruises to Quebec City which we had not been told about (one that returns by cruise and includes a visit to the falls on St. Lawrence (!!) , and another that cruises 1-way and returns by bus). However we learned about these too late and were stuck taking the bus which was recommended to us by Westin. The bus was fine... but it was not the tour we wanted and asked about and really wanted. Additionally, we learned too late that there IS an evening cocktail/dinner cruise on a nice River Boat for scenic views of the city which we had not been told about. We also cut our day short on day 2 at the Biosphere (which I HIGHLY recommend) because we were told that there was only 1 light show at 630pm for the Notre Dame cathedral. Not only was this information wrong, since there was a 2nd later show, but the tickets were sold out by the time we got to the cathedral at 6pm at the advice of the Westin. Finally, the cleaning of the room could have been better. The ceiling of our bathroom was splattered with something gross (when we arrived and was never cleaned), and the the tile in the shower was mildewed. The hotel advertises itself as the \"newest\" luxury hotel in Montreal, but I have a hard time believing this. I will comment that the location is ideal and the staff were all very friendly ... unfortunately though not as knowledgeable as they should have been. I believe they hire interns for the summer from France rather than locals and they do not seem properly trained as local experts to act as a concierge!

The hotel is located just on the outskirts of old town, so it is a 15-20 minute walk to several locations to visit including the Old Port, and the shops on St. Catherines. It is also situation close to the Square Victoria Metro Station stop. The hotel is in a fairly quiet area but close enough to places you want to see. Valet (although about $25) and check-in process were quick and seemless. There was also complimentary ice tea for all guests in the lobby area. Right away, you notice that the hotel is only a couple of years old, including the lobby, common areas and guest rooms. The elevators also have an added security of having to use your room key to go to a guest room floor. Our room was clean and quite spacious with 2 comfortable queen size beds as you would expect from a Westin (also, with plenty of pillows). The bathroom was a very nice size including a large shower stall. All they key amenities were in the room, as well as a large flat screen TV. But within a few minutes of being in the room, we noticed a problem that would lead to a couple of other problems during our stay: No cold/cool water in the faucet or shower. The water was only hot and too hot to wash your hands for more than 1-2 seconds, and definitely too hot to take a shower. We called the front desk and they sent a technician right away. By then we were on our way out for a late lunch. Upon returning, we didnt see a note or a message from anyone on whether or not the issue was fixed. We quickly checked the water - and the issue was not resolved. When I went down to the front desk, they immediately offered to switch our room (before I even asked). However, they moved us to a room one floor below almost right below our existing floor. So when we got to that room, the water was still too hot and no cold/cool water was coming out. We eventually left our room to go for dinner and noted the issue again to the front desk (where they were very apologetic and offered to switch our rooms again). They sent the technician again, and when we came back from dinner the front desk told us the issue was finally resolved, which it was. However, when we woke up in the morning, there was a bill under our door even though we had a second night left to stay. It turns out, because it was a 2 night stay with the second night free because of SPG points, when they switched our room, they hadn't linked the two nights together, and the 2nd night was still in the original room. As a result, our room keys stopped working in the elevator and our rooms by noon time. The front desk quickly resolved that issue once we went downstairs again. For our troubles, the front desk did remove the valet charge for one night. Other than the issues encountered - which the front desk was apologetic and attempted to quickly resolve - the hotel is very nice. The gym is of good size. The pool area looked nice, although it could have been a larger pool. All staff were very helpful and cheery, and we received good recommendations from the concierge on 2 occasions.

The hotel is near public transportation (between Metro Square Victoria and Metro Place d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes on the orange line) and is located adjacent to Old Montreal and across from the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convention centre. Though this makes less of a difference in the summer,the drive-in atrium is quite a civilized feature in Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messy winter months. We have generally found all of the hotel staff to be excellent. Combined with the new facilities and dependable Westin d\u00c3\u00a9cor and features (heavenly bed/shower, etc),this makes this one of our two go-to hotels in the city we visit the most frequently. It seems that we are always offered free wi-fi at check-in, though we have never taken advantage of this (no roaming charges for 3G within Canada). We have stayed in a Deluxe King room (which has two walls of windows, but feels slightly less spacious, perhaps due to the column in the room), a Westin Club King room (with access to the difficult-to-find club lounge), and a Premium King room (probably the most spacious with a small separate, though windowless, sitting room that is separated from the bedroom by a hall and the bathroom). For just a relaxing weekend away, we prefer the bright and airy Deluxe, but for meeting up with friends, the Premium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sitting area is also nice. The glass-bottom pool is a fun gimmick, though it is not particularly practical for swimming laps. I assume that children find this endlessly entertaining given that we spent half an hour just floating above the glass portion, looking at the guests entering and leaving through the driveway three stories below. The fitness facilities are very good, as well. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and high-quality.While we are not huge fans of the buffet concept, this one has won us over. There is occasionally a line-up on weekends. We have had tapas in the bar during one of our stays, but the abundance of restaurants in Old Montreal diminishes the appeal of eating at the hotel. Starbucks is at the end of the block (past the Embassy Suites).

There are two towers, with no elevator from the lobby, at least for the tower I stayed in. You have to take an escalator and then an elevator to get to your room. Having booked a \"suite\" with a king size bed and a \"separate\" room with a pull out sofabed, I was disappointed to find that the separate room was really just a foyer space with no door. There was a 2nd tv in the \"room\", which was otherwise bleak. The sofabed when opened permitted a space of about 4 inches between the metal frame and the wooden chesterfield housing a fridge, drawers and the tv. This means you have to sidestep in to the main room, and, like me, you could cut your leg. Next, the \"swimming\" pool. It is a wading pool. You cannot swim in it, even if it was not filled with kids, which it was when I visited on a weekend. There is a small hottub, also probably filled with children's urine, and a sauna I did not try. Other notable incidents, which were actually humorous to me and my friend, were the fact that dirty dishes and cutlery sat in a hallway windowsill for the duration of our 3 day stay (the bet was offered at day 2 that it would not be cleaned before we left). Also, having left a $5 tip for the maid after the first night, she was apparently not happy, as she left my boxer shorts strewn on the bed (which was made), and the comforter thrown over a chair, not even folded. It made me yearn for cheap hotels in Cuba where the maids go out of their way to turn the towels into swans and such. Other than that, the location is great. The room service menu is smaller than other hotels, but the prices seemed reasonable. All I ordered was a pitcher of fresh orange juice. When they delivered orange juice from concentrate, the $20 charge was refunded. The room was otherwise fine, and clean, except for a dirty night table that was cleaned when I called for service.

Our group booked a couple rooms using a corporate rate and I feel that we made the right decision choosing a Westin property. The location of the hotel was perfect, Old Montreal had tons of historic sights and restaurants to choose from, and was a short cab ride to the bars, clubs, and casino that we visited at night. The hotel only has valet parking, which for $25 was not a bad deal considering if you called down ahead of time they could have your car ready in 10 minutes flat (there was also an underground city lot across the street which was $20 a night, but for the extra $5 why not go with the hotels). The service was great, the front desk was very pleasant, even when dealing with a pretty large group. We were treated with a Globe and Mail newspaper every morning and housekeeping would always come back at a later time since we often slept in. The rooms were nice and modern, about average for a 4-star hotel. The 2 queen beds were large and comfortable, the room included a minibar to store your drinks as well as an ipod player/alarm clock, and the bathrooms had a very nice glass enclosed shower with a rainfall showerhead. Some members of our group opted to go for suites and I would highly recommend getting one, the bedrooms were much larger and having 2 bathrooms and a sitting area was great for entertaining. The fitness gym/sauna area was pretty amazing, with treadmills, free weights and weight machines rivaling those of most private clubs. Unfortunately the indoor pool was under construction/maintenance so we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to use it, but the front-desk informed us of this at check-in and offered us keycards to access the pool at the neighbouring Intercontinental. The only fault I found at the hotel was the price of room service, it was pretty outrageous. But with tons of dining options nearby we found some pretty good places to eat out.

A problem with setting a high standard is that expectations are raised; on this second visit, things did not go as smoothly but it was still, overall, a good experience.

The very helpful desk clerk offered us a corner room on a lower floor; we lost the view but gained light and space. This room was massive, but with wasted space due to an odd layout. Instead of a glass-enclosed shower, there was a bath-shower combination; the bath was too shallow to be useful for anything but bathing children, but the shower was fine. There was a shortage of hooks and the towel stack included a frayed and stained hand towel that looked like a rag. Hard to see how this could have been missed. The bed, as before, was so wonderful that it was hard to leave the room. And the front desk service was excellent; warm and accommodating. Early check-in and late checkout were not a problem. Internet was free and fast. Three additional service critiques: we booked a rate that was to include some gifts and amenities; on both visits we had to request them when it was clear they were not forthcoming.

The staff at Le Westin are both friendly and welcoming, and very accommodating with most requests.

Convenient location and comfortable bed.\u201d", "Author": "kala327", "ReviewID": "UR87338002", "Content": "Stayed at the Westin due to a favorable deal I found on the Tourisme Montreal site in which the 2nd night was half the price of the first. I was also pricing out the Embassy Suites right next door but the only deal comparable involved a full, non-refundable prepayment which I am always a little skittish about just in case of an unforeseen change of plans. The \"Fall Sweet Deal\" via the Tourisme Montreal site also included the breakfast buffet, some soap products from a Canadian company and various coupons (which I didn't use). The purpose of my stay was for a weekend getaway to Montreal and Quebec City. The hotel was next to the convention center, but my motive for staying here was more the proximity to the \"Old Town/Old Port\" as well as a relatively central metro station and the city center itself. I didn't look to stay in the Old Port proper as I wanted to be close to a metro and I prefer larger hotels to boutique hotels. My late (close to midnight) arrival was flawless as check-in was a breeze. I've never stayed in a Westin but have read many reviews praising their \"heavenly beds\" so after a long flight and late arrival I was hoping the reviews were accurate. Sure enough they were. I don't usually sleep particularly restful in a hotel, but the bed was fantastic, and made me feel like I made the right move sticking with the Westin instead of the slightly cheaper Embassy Suites next door. The breakfast buffet was a nice spread, although not cooked-to-order. They did have bagels, smoked salmon, meats, and pre-made omelettes, cereals, fresh fruits, pancakes, etc. The wait service consistently underperformed on both mornings as they never topped up my tea nor took away the used plates, but overall it is a minor point in an otherwise above-average breakfast buffet. As noted by another reviewer, the pool was indeed out of service, but I came to sight-see, not to swim so it didn't matter to me. I imagine that some people particularly choose a hotel on the basis whether it has an indoor pool or not, so if this is important to you, I would call ahead as the bulletin from the hotel implied that the pool would be closed until further notice. The room was modern and I loved that the shower had a glass door instead of a shower curtain, except I was surprised to find that the shower faucet was broken. It literally was detached from the fixture. I could get the shower to work by holding the fixture while I turned it, but nothing was holding it up and keeping it from crashing to the floor. I called the operator who didn't seem to know how to respond to this odd problem. She didn't offer to change the room but said they could send someone up to look at it. I declined as I was on a short timetable and didn't want to be hassled with workers coming in and out of the room, but I was surprised the shower faucet was completely broken as you would think the cleaning staff would have noticed this when they last cleaned the shower. I asked that they note my account to ensure no one thought I broke it and she said she would and I never heard anything again from the hotel management about this. No apology, no offer to change rooms, nothing. It was a strange inconvenience and I suppose I could have insisted to change rooms, just at that point it wasn't worth the hassle. I reminded them again when I checked out (that the faucet was broken) -- so that they didn't place another unsuspecting tourist in that room until they fixed it -- and the front desk clerk acted as if this was the first he heard of this, so my guess is the operator on day one never noted my account. Either way, I wasn't looking for a down charge but I think they could have at least acknowledged and apologized for the hassle as a courteous gesture. Otherwise, as other reviewers have noted, there really isn't much storage space on the vanity. If you bring a lot of stuff with you when you travel, this is something to keep in mind. In fact, the housekeeper had no choice but to put extra towels on top of the toilet tank. For as clean as they may keep the toilet, I find this off-putting and something I might expect to see on a lower class hotel, if at all. The drawer pulls on the dressers are very awkward, narrow and hard to grab as they are akin to small, little solid tassels. in fact, when I went to open one drawer, the pull actually came off the drawer. I don't think I've ever noted a drawer pull in a review, but after the shower faucet remained in my hand after I tried to turn it on (because it wasn't attached to the wall), I guess I should have been surprised when the drawer pull remained in my hand as well. It wasn't attached anymore to the drawer, perhaps the screw was too bored out. Obviously, they cut some corners during installation. I hear the hotel is relatively new so it just seemed odd to have these problems. The internet access was included and worked just fine on my iphone for the duration of my stay. A national newspaper was outside my door on both the weekday and weekend. That was nice as I didn't expect the weekend paper (Saturday). The room wasn't overly large, but it was fine for a short stay. On my second and last morning, I noticed that the statement printout that they slid under the door had my stay rated my incorrectly and, as a result, they charged me an extra $20. Fortunately, I had my printout from my reservation and they credited me for the difference without any problem, although it took two trips to the front desk to get this done. Had I not had my printout I imagine it would have been a different story. All in all, it was not a hassle-free stay, but the bed was great and the location was convenient so I was pleased overall.

We checked at about 02:00, after a late flight and really appreciated the incredibly comfortable beds and crispy fresh sheets. We were surprised in the morning though, to find that there was no bathtub in the room. in the shower, we quickly ran out of shampoo and soap, as it seemed the room was set up for single occupancy and on an \"amenity budget\". The room was otherwise adequate in size and felt spacious. The desk was small though, and the closet cramped. We requested a room with a tub, and the front desk supervisor accommodated us with a nice room on the 10th floor. Unfortunately the closet was now truly microscopic at only 19\" of hanger space - barely enough for one person. There was no stationery in the room, and no minibar (read: small fridge). There were 3 wall outlets in the room, two all in use for the various fixtures and the one not in use was in an awkward place behind a sofa. The desk mounted \"power panel\" did not work, so guess where I had to plug in the laptop and the cell? Again, symbolic amounts of towels, soap and shampoo prompted a call to the \"action line\". Some 30 minutes later the goods arrived, but the housekeeper cleverly dropped the towels and supplies on the bed, and ran for dear life. We soon discovered why, when we tried to put the loot in the bathroom: NO place at all to put any of it down, unless inside the handbasin. Not an inch of usable horizontal surface, and the access to what was available was hampered by the door which would not open fully and by the clever placement of the cabinet (see photo) right against the wall to make things worse. Very poor design it seems. The AV and the HVAC were all in working order and met all our expectation. The internet was included in the rate and worked well. The room decor was neutral, with \"model home\" look and feel, a bit sterile / generic. The carpet was in good condition and clean, but not comfortable and certainly did not feel \"heavenly\" . The pool infrastructure was non existent though: you will have to change in the single solitary postage stamp sized toilet with a pedestal sink and a shower stall, as no change rooms are provided. Inside there was no shelf to put clothes on while changing. There are no lockers in the pool area to store your clothes while using the pool. In short one has to walk wet to your room after the swim. The swimming pool itself was interesting, though: located right over the enclosed drive up (excellent for those cold windy wintry days in Montreal) with a see through glass bottom revealing a perfect view of the motor lobby, equally treating arriving guests to a vista of swimmers in the pool from the bottom: a peeping Tom's / exhibitionists dream - all others please keep your bathing suits on and no hanky panky!!!", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location.....great rooms and views\u201d", "Author": "grammysharon", "ReviewID": "UR84024265", "Content": "Le Westin made our visit to Montreal wonderful.

It was one of the quietest rooms we've ever had....no noise from neighboring rooms or above. Things that could be improved: -The service was lacking to make it a top notch five star hotel. There were often long waits to speak to concierge or front desk or even to get someone on the phone. The young man that was the lifeguard at nights was rude and gave alot of attitude when we requested a towel, etc. The other lifeguards were lovely though so it was just one person. -Parking was expensive (about $30CND/night).

This was not the case at all in this hotel--the room, lobby, public areas--we experienced no ill reactions anywhere in the hotel.

The hotel is very nice, modern and clean, the staff were very polite (A+).

They only have valet parking for $26/day but are close to many of the major attractions and the metro is a great way to get around. The room was very spacious and clean, the washroom had a very large standup shower and no bathtub (I actually prefer it that way). I'd recommend this hotel but there were a few small issues. We stayed 3 nights and were woken up because of noise during two of those nights. One of them was an idiot banging on a door (hardly the hotel's fault) but the other has to do with their building, we could clearly hear the people walking around in the room above us. They didn't seem to be jumping or anything, but for some reason the ceiling/floor is not well sound insulated so we heard them walking (enough to prevent us from sleeping well). They have a pool and they advertise it as having a glass floor, which is true, but its a very small pool (probably about 12' x 25'), so its ok for taking a dip but too small to exercise in or for the kids to enjoy. They have a gym with a decent equipment which is open 24 hours/day. Oh yeah, its right across the street from the convention center.

You can walk to the busy spots on St Catherine, or take a stroll over to Old Montreal & the port area. There are two metro stations close by. The closest is accessible if you just walk across the street to the northwest corner of the Palais des Congres building. The other is about two blocks away near Square Victoria. From either of those, it's easy to get to the Eaton Center or wherever else you need to go. The hotel itself was very nice. Comfortable beds & everything was very clean. The staff was very helpful & friendly (and they put up with our poor attempts at French). We were also very appreciative that they held on to our luggage for a few hours after we checked out. This allowed us to go get a massage & have an early dinner before moving to the hotel across town that I had to stay at for my business meeting later in the week. The room was spacious & clean. The bed was comfortable. They had a nice flatscreen TV with several HD channels. We had a very nice, roomy walk in shower. I had a little bit of trouble with the internet access at one point, but they have tech support available (above & beyond front desk people) and they were able to get the problem fixed in about 7 or 8 minutes.

It is therefore unfortunate that the designers of the hotel have made some very poor choices which in my opinion will doom it to failure. Westin regulars will notice that finishes and furnishings look like Westin appointments, but are of a quality more befitting a lesser chain. The very thin dark veneers of the contemporary furniture are already showing signs of wear despite the property being open for less than a year. When we checked in, as a Starwood Platinum, we were given an upgrade to a room on the 21st floor. Since the property was no where near full, I expected at least a junior suite. What I got, was a smallish room with a king bed, a 42 inch LCD TV and a good desk. The bathroom was small with a single bowl granite vanity and a large walk in shower cabinet equipped with the two headed Heavenly Shower. There was no tub. If I was traveling on business, the room would have been fine for a 1-2 night stay. I was however in town for the weekend with my wife, so I called the front desk to inquire about an upgrade to a larger room. The front desk manager was very receptive to my requests and made arrangements for us to be moved to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room on the 14th floor, which has a separate sitting area in addition to the regular room. The bell staff took care of transferring our luggage while we were out and the new keys were waiting for us when we returned to the hotel later in the evening. Since the transfer went so well, it was a disappointment bordering on shock when we opened the door to our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and switched on the light. We found ourselves staring at a pile of our luggage in a room that looked like a storage area for furniture. The room was lit with a single overhead fixture that contained a low wattage energy saver fluorescent bulb that seemed to amplify the starkness of the fact that our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sitting area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had no windows; no supplemental lighting of any sort and nothing on the walls except for the neutral wallcovering, which under the low wattage light appeared slightly green. It was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh my god\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moment, but not in a good way. The premium room on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SPG Floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd may have had slightly more floor area, but the smaller windows, and large amounts of wasted space due to building structures made it seem smaller than our previous room on the 21st floor, which was at least brighter. The bathroom was smaller and was not equipped with the Heavenly Shower, and we were not provided with shower gel or mouth wash. During our stay we encountered sticking door locks, faulty thermostats, and very slow to heat hot water, but we can attribute these deficiencies as the teething pains of a new property. All of our issues were addressed very quickly and professionally. Having seen the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms on the 21st and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms on the 14th however it is highly likely that I will not return to this property, unless a suitable alternative is not available.

The kids and I tagged along- ages 13, 5, and 4 weeks old. I chose the Westin based on being new and I thought the kids would like the pool (it has glass bottom panels that allow you to look below to the entry way of the hotel). We did the opening special which was $209 per night and included valet parking and breakfast for the 4 of us. (I think I heard that the price of the buffet breakfast alone was around $20 per person, so this deal was quite the savings!) The room- When we walked in to our room on the 16th floor, we thought it was beautiful. An oversized hotel room, with 2 heavenly beds (very comfy), a large desk, 2 chairs and side table. Lots of room for the 5 of us to move about. The view out of the huge window was of the city. It was a gorgeous view! The drapes on the window blocked out so much light that my kids slept in and had to be awakened at 930 every morning. You would have thought with how dark it stayed with the drapes pulled that it was night time - this was a very good thing, no peeping sun in the morning! The bathroom was large with a very large walk in shower. The vanity was granite and overall the lighting in the bathroom was very bright. The only bad thing is that they didn't have refrigerators yet. The bellman said that they would be getting them and there was a place for them in the dresser drawers cabinet. The place was very clean and housekeeping was more than accomodating. The service-Not speaking any French had me concerned as I heard that this may be a problem for us. Not so, everyone was very friendly to us and most in the city as well as the hotel spoke decent English. We had trouble getting our laptop to connect to the free high speed, and the front desk was very helpful with connecting us to the people to get it working. Within 5 minutes we were able to access the internet. Also, the concierege was very helpful in pointing out areas of interest and the best routes to get there. The location- This hotel is within walking distance to the pier and about 4 or so blocks away from the Notre Dame Basilica. The metro was right across the street. This hotel is located in Old Montreal. The pool- Although very small, it was great for the kids. There were also 2 \"hot tubs\" on the other side of the pool, but because all of the water was soooo cold, they were more like small pools. The kids would shower to get warm and then run and get into the pool. We never found out if there was a problem with the heater, but construction was still going on in the building close to the pool area. Construction- We did hear some construction noises but not until about 9 am and never in the evening. This was not a problem for us. Parking- It is all valet parking! I think it was $20 or so per day, but we had it included in our package. It only took about 5 minutes for us to get our car when we needed it! Quick service. Restaurant- This was a 4 or 5 star restaurant and had a wonderful breakfast buffet with everything you could want. The omelets were the best! Room service was very expensive, but isn't it always? Very good food though and only about 30 minutes wait. Dinner was very good and we received coupons for buy one entree get 1/2 off of the second along with kids eat free coupons when we checked in. We still spent $40 with tip included, but it was very delicious food with excellent service as the restaurant was pretty empty at 7 pm. Overall impression - Even though this was a very nice hotel, there were lots of families there. You would have never known it though because the hallways were very quiet! It seemed as though we were the only ones there (but we saw our neighbors going into their rooms a few times). I am very picky in my taste for hotels I stay at and this one definitely met and exceeded my expectations.

Rarely have I ever written a critical review of a Westin Hotel. The facility has great po- tential but is not ready for prime time. I has opened far too early with inadequate training of staff, completion of work in progress, and poor design. Several previous reviews have mentioned some of the difficulties they have encountered e.g., poor concierge service, lack of adequate staff, inconsistent service, long waits to gain \"access\" to your car even after paying over $25 a night for parking. My wife and I love Montreal and Quebec, appreciating the people and the culture; but this hotel does not give a good first impression of such a wonderful city. We travel to Quebec for pleasure often and have never been disappointed. Management really needs to take note in a very serious way the needs that are to be met. While I received an apology from the hotel for the poor service, that is fine but it won't \"cut it\" if this is not addressed. While the few staff we dealt with were very pleasant and did the best they could under the circumstances, smiles and kind gestures need to be met with service.

If you walk one way, you are at Old Montreal/Notre Dame Cathedral, and if you walk the other way, you are downtown, right on Sainte Catherine street. It seemed to be only a max of 20 minutes from anything and everything. We have extremely high standards for dining, and every restaurant we went to (each within comfortable walking distance of the hotel) was outstanding. The GPS brought us right to the entrance of the hotel on Sainte Antoine street, and we had the car valeted. We had booked through hotels.com, and since I brought a copy of the confirmation email, check-in was easy. We received two keys for the 15th floor. Upon arriving in the room, we were pleased with the simple, elegant decor complete with a flat screen TV, and an iHome speaker/clock radio. After two nights I can say that the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. Everything was extremely clean and new! We had brought some juice and beverages to have in the hotel and were a bit surprised to find that there was no mini-fridge. However, we called concierge for some ice buckets and they were brought up promptly by an employee. This ended up making the drinks colder even quicker, so it ended up working out nicely.

There still seems to be a bit of work left to do to make it an inviting hotel experience. The style is very nice, I liked the grand entrance and the glass bottom pool. The room was fairly spacious and well appointed, very nice bathroom with glass door shower and very comfortable Queen-size beds. You can tell the hotel is not ready yet because: lack of signage!! I had no idea how to get to my room! The hotel is very big and feels like a maze! There are two \"towers\" in this hotel -- I was in the rear tower. To get to my room, I needed to climb the escalator to the restaurant/lounge level, then find the elevator -- of which there were several. The first bank of elevators I tried, nearest to the escalators, brought me up to an open and unfinished space which was definitely not my floor. It looked like unfinished convention or office space, which was strangely unrestricted to curious or lost guests. When I returned to the lounge level, a security guard approached me and instructed me to go down another hall to find the correct elevator. On my floor, I also noticed a number of rooms with sheets of paper taped to the door with room numbers on them, and boxes of materials (light bulbs, signs, etc) just sitting around. Trying to find the pool/fitness room, involved going down the elevator to the lounge level, walking through the lounge area, and going up another set of elevators in the other tower. Again, no signage, so I had to guess where these other elevators were and what floor the pool was on. Some travel tips... the Metro is just across the street at the Palais des Congres. You can also park there for half of what the hotel charges for parking. There is an Eggspectation restaurant around the back of the hotel, where you can get a good breakfast or lunch for a fraction of what the hotel's restaurant charges.

But there are things that spoil the overall experience in this hotel which is out of the control of the staff. Whoever designed this hotel should not be designing another one. First of all, the drive-in drop-off area is too small - put 3 big cars and a taix in there, and you have urself a traffic jam. It is much better to park temporarily on the street to unload - kinda defeat the purpose of staying at this luxury hotel. During check-in checkout times, despite the valet/bell boys working flat out, it still takes 50 min to get my car out of the carpark. C'mon Westin, we are paying $26 for the valet - at least provide some service. This is not a matter of valet/bell boys being lazy (they aren't), but a matter of having a better system. Same goes to the checkin checkout counter - you should expect a longggggg queue during \"peak\" hours. Express checkout solves part of the problem. 2nd bad design: if your room is in another tower at the back, you have to haul your luggage from the lobby up the lift or escalator one floor up, then haul it 100 metre to another lift, then haul it up to your floor. 3rd bad design: the king bed room is tiny with hardly any room to move. Trying to squeeze so much furniture in is stupid. Switching on all 3-4 lights in the room still does not provide adequate lighting - but I guess some people like the room dim. The light surrounding the ensuite bathroom mirror is nice but stupid - it is too glarey to the eyes. Everything used in the room is genuinely good stuff though, from linen to toileteries to the heavenly bed. The room is also very well-made up each morning. But, if you're paying that much, you'd expect that much. So, overall, it's a good hotel, but I won't go there again just because there are too many little things that add up to spoil the overall experience.

The rooms themselves are large and nice and ready for guests, at least for the most part, but the property as a whole still seems like it hasn't undergone a final check through with Starwood, in preparation for actually opening. As a result, as with any franchise, it kind of tarnishes the brand as a whole. The underlying problem we witnessed over four days was a management/manpower one: this property needs desperately a competent general manager and then it needs to hire many more workers, especially on weekends. The staff we encountered were helpful and great but there just weren't enough of them. This caused a horrible tie up in the valet area with guests waiting an hour for their cars and an employee passing out from being overworked. This also caused long check-in lines and in actuality no real dedicated concierge, as they were expected to check people in, too. As for the elevators, the property should act like the airlines and give some sort of credit to anyone staying there when they are broken. It really isn't fun carrying kids up dozens of flights of stairs. This isn't all the property's fault - I'm sure it's Thyssen Krupp - who installed defective elevators - including designing a system that could take down all of the three elevators at once. But as consumers we don't think about the bad service work of Thyssen Krupp, but instead blame the hotel. It's just not the only little design flaw of the hotel . Aside from the parking debacle and lack of sufficient space, I don't understand how someone could have designed a swimming pool that small for a property that large. The heat still doesn't work so it now appears that there are three small pools but at some point in the future they will eventually fix the heating problems and then the sole remaining pool will be tiny (even if the glass bottom is very cool). Whether it's space in the cabinet of your room empty begging for a small refrigerator or an exercise room lacking earphones, this hotel still doesn't live up for the westin name. Which is ashame, because the hardworking staff, few of them that there are, are nice and make a great effort and should be recognized.

We did not take the car out even once, The room despite the horrific view was clean and the decor was very Asian inspired with realxing color choices. Construction was complete so we didn't encounter any construction noise or zones but the Spa was not yet opened which we knew in advance. The staff must improve their customer service or this hotels elegant Zen-like environment will not be able to sustain it.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida, US", "Title": "\u201cNot good\u201d", "Author": "NoNet60", "ReviewID": "UR34534751", "Content": "I had mixed feelings about booking in a new hotel...but got a good rate so decided to go for it. As it turns out, I should have listened to that inner voice. Stayed the first few days of July - pulled up and couldn't locate a valet, lobby area deserted, finally found one person to check us in. Agree with previous reviewer that entire hotel very corporate and generic, yet if you were the events planner for your company, I would be very nervous about booking a conference here...at least for several months until they finish the place. Room was nice, flat screen, etc. Didn't bring the laptop so no idea on the wifi, Heavenly Bed is great, bathroom nice but nothing too special (what is the point of the double-headed shower?), we had a nice view from the 21st floor to the river. Room was tight, however, not terribly spacious and no local area information, maps, etc. - the stuff you usually find on the desk. We were not upset about the pool, as I knew it was not complete - they do say that on the website someplace, I believe. Good location for walking, access to subway, etc. (Right next door to Embassy Suites and Intercontinental.) Elevators consistently out of service. No water one night from 2 - 5am (they did announce it in advance). We had a club room and the club was a joke! First of all, this is a new hotel, so why did they build such a small club area? It will be very crowded up there when/if this hotel ever starts filling up the club floors. Worst of all was the supply of food/drink - the reason most people pay extra for this amenity. Out of bottled water entirely for the first two days, and although we don't drink soda, noticed it didn't seem to be restocked very often either. Breakfast they were constantly out of food, to the point where it became comical -for instance, no bread/bagels but lovely little salmon rolls with nothing to put them on, then bread to toast and little pastries but no knives or plates - I used the end of a spoon to spread butter and we ate off napkins. We were getting very creative but by the third morning decided to go out for breakfast (Eggspectations is right around the corner). Room coffee was awful...Starbucks in a cup that you see everywhere now and it just doesn't brew right. The kicker was the morning we decided to go out to breakfast, I thought I could grab a cup of coffee from the lounge first but they were out of coffee. At 9:00am. On a Saturday morning. Finally went down to the restaurant (always an adventure, as typically only one of three elevators was working during our stay) and they gave me some. The poor guy working the club lounge was very nice and very harried - he was wearing a suit and had to act as concierge and waitress, not a good combination. Trying to sit at a desk and help people then coming in and cleaning up the sticky mess on the tables - they need two people up there. Club room itself seemed nothing special - they still wanted $4.95 for the bottle of water. No minifridge or minibar at all - a nice big empty cabinet under the TV though where it may one day go...when they finish the hotel. Baseboard moldings had fallen off all the walls on the 21st floor where we stayed and they laid there for the 3 days we were there. No construction noise on our floor but we were second from the top. (Club floors are 21-22 I think.) Drinks in the bar - the bartender was very nice but of course it was hotel-pricey. Didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked a bit disorganized (like the whole place) when we peeked in at breakfast. The reason we weren't too unhappy? No 1: Montreal is fantastic!! Happy just to be there. No 2: We had the \"Pay Your Age\" promotion so the last two nights were $__ (let's just say I was born before 1970, so less than $70 per night) which is about the right price for this hotel. Of course, bill was wrong at checkout but they cheerfully corrected it. Everyone we overheard checking in or out had complaints/problems/issues. Random comments on the hallway, in the elevator: \"Trainwreck\", \"What a Nightmare\". However - EVERY employee we met was doing their best and very friendly - not their fault. I give the Service 3* because of the overall lack of oversight, not because of the individuals we met. WHERE is Starwood senior management? Someone from corporate needs to go do and anonymous stay there and address some of the more pressing issues. Bottom line, it will eventually be what it was intended to be - a nice hotel for conventions.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cUnnecessarily Generic with Lots of Hiccups\u201d", "Author": "StevenAinNYC", "ReviewID": "UR34420327", "Content": "A friend and I have been to Montreal a number of times and had previously stayed at the W (great but a little too clubby with rooms built for couples) and the St. Paul (aims high but pretentious and feels a little beat up).

Anyway, we arrived in Montreal and pulled up to a very ugly driveway and were greeted with a very visible front and center overflowing trash can by the valet station. That was a terrible first impression. The lobby was stark, barren and plain and they were three hours late getting us our room -- sitting around a lobby is no way to start a vacation. The rooms and hallways were corporate and plain, really surprising for a new hotel. And the towels were so brand new that there were fuzzies over all our clothes and in our hair every day. Ultimately, if you need a clean place to stay with very comfortable beds, the Westin is great. If you want a hotel you'll remember, forget it. It feels like no thought or style was put into this hotel. Just blah and generic, like out of a movie that satirizes corporate generic hotels.

My boyfriend is a Starwood employee and got us a special rate (which I won't disclose) but it was far less than the $230 +/night they were asking that weekend, which in my opinion is not worth it for this hotel. For starters, the hotel is still under construction (which the website doesn't tell you, although they advertise amenities that are not yet available). The touted lap-pool is not completed (although you can use the pools of the nearby sister properties), nor is the spa (although there is info in the room about it). Only one of the three elevators are operational at any given time, and painfully slow. There are several incomplete areas of the hotel covered in sheets or tarps, and that \"new carpet smell\" filled the air. We were the first guests to occupy our room, which still had a little construction dust in the bathtub, and some dust on the furniture. The room contained a flat panel TV, a clock radio that supports the iPod/iPhone, cordless phone, several lamps, and a Heavenly Bed. The room is spacious with a full-size sofa bed and a large desk, but no stationery or note pads for writing. The AC worked well, and we had good wifi reception. There is a very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theme to the hotel, evidenced by the soap, toiletries, recycling bins, etc. The bathroom was not as spacious as the rest of the room, but it wasn't a tight fit. The bathtub has dual shower heads and curved shower curtain. The bathroom fan is very quiet and the towels are wonderfully soft and thick. The vanity however, has false drawers, so you don't have any storage in the bathroom. Overall, the room was OK, but on the basic side for what is supposed to be a 4-Star hotel -- we were not impressed and very glad we were not paying the rack rate. We visited two bars/restaurants in the hotel. Gazette on the first floor, and the Reporter Lounge on the 3rd floor. Of course the prices were typical for a hotel. Tuesday-Saturday a reception is offered at the Reporter bar, from 5-7. However, you must get there early, as the free sampling of food and beverages go quickly. Valet parking is $26CAD/day, in/out, but here is a parking lot across the street that offers parking for a few dollars less. The hotel is in a very convenient location to the Old Port, and adjacent to a Metro station. Given that Montreal is very walkable, you don't need to take your car out, unless you're leaving the city. I found most of the hotel staff to be warm and friendly, with the exception of the day-time front desk staff. The bar, restaurant, and room service staff were quite congenial. The bell staff, valet, and housekeeping were good (but there was no turndown service). Everyone was always smiling and eager to help, although the front desk day staff could seem a bit more motivated. All I can guess is that their lack of enthusiasm stems from dealing with the complaints and comments from disappointed clients who expected the hotel to have the quality of a 4-star Starwood Group property, and the advertised features available. As one reviewer mentioned, it seems as if Starwood wanted to get this place open by peak tourist season, even though there are still building permits on the windows. They should indeed be ashamed for delivering a product in this condition. I don't think that we'll stay here again, even with the employee discount. There are several properties in the Starwood Group and other hotel chains in the immediate vicinity that would give you better quality for the same price or less than what you'd pay at Le Westin.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cthe incredible staff was not worth the inconveniences\u201d", "Author": "mf84", "ReviewID": "UR34185047", "Content": "I would have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel had I gone a year from now when construction is complete and once their systems are more fine tuned.

In the future I see this hotel as being a great place to stay, however the hotel is brand new, and during our stay there were a few significant problems. There were also some nice surprises though. Checking in, the staff was extremely friendly and inviting. Then, the first 3 problems happend, all in a row! 1) we were informed that the glass bottomed swiming pool was still under construction. 2) the package we booked was supposed to include a welcoming bag with a free gift, breakfast tickets for the restaurant, and various other little goodies. This was forgotten and i had to request it later on in the evening. 3) i tried to smoothly slide the valet his tip as I was handing him my keys, and instead droped the money on the ground. Not the hotels fault obviously, but still felt it was worth mentioning here for comedic effect. The room itselft was beautiful. It probably had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in in my life. I could have stayed in it for the entire trip if it wasn't for the construction noises (we'll get to that later). The bathroom was also gorgeous. Only problem was the \"dual nozzle rainforest showerhead\" advertized on the website isn't really as neat as it sounds. I was expecting to be enveloped in water, sprayed from all sides (or at least 2 sides), with absolutely no escape from the wetness. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It's just a normal shower head with two different settings on it. At least the bathroom was beautiful. My wake-up call the next morning was not beautiful - mostly because I didn't order one. It came in the form of construction noises at 7:45am. One story above us, directly outside our window! I know this for a fact because you could see the scafolding from our window. You could say it doubled as a sunshade for our room. It's one thing to rent out a hotel while it's still under construction, but care should at least be taken to avoid renting out rooms that are within a close proximity to the noise. I would have complained had I not already grumbled the night before about the false advertising on the swiming pool being open. And now for some positives: -delicious buffet breakfast located far away from construction noises. -extra bathrobe and toothpastes (knew i forgot to pack something) given upon request. When the check-out receipt arrived under our door, the total price was incorrect. It did not reflect the special package which I had booked through their website. The staff did however quickly fix the problem at the front the desk. They also appologized again for the lack of swimming pool when i mentioned it, and where able to ammend the situation so that I didn't leave the hotel with a negative image of the experience. Then ofcourse the valet took 30 minutes to retrieve my car. Just like the rest of the staff though they were extremely polite, which makes it difficult to be annoyed with the situation. A possible reason for the problem could have been insufficient number of valet attendents scheduled to work, and/or lack of space in the driveway to park all the cars (it was full - when I did finally get my car the attendant had to bring it onto the street). Overall, I would say that this hotel will be a wonderful place to stay, but only after it's completely finished and all the kinks have been worked out of the system. In my opinion I believe the main thing saving this hotel from bad executive decisions is a team of very dedicated and professional staff members. At the moment I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll ever return, but I would recommend it for the traveller desiring fine hospitality in a great location....just give it another 6 months before you book.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusettes", "Title": "\u201cGood location, unimpressive room for the price\u201d", "Author": "wenderful", "ReviewID": "UR33905328", "Content": "I decided to pay up for a premium room but was really unimpressed.

It is decorated very nicely and is in an excellent location near historic Montreal with only a very short walk to the Notre Dame Basilica. We booked a \"grand opening\" rate which included valet parking ($26CAD/day and 2 days of a buffet breakfast (which would have been about $86CAD/day for the 5 of us. All the staff we encountered, from the front desk, valet attendants, maids, to the waitresses in the restaurant were extremely friendly and professional. We requested extra towels and a rollaway bed, the towels were brought in 10 minutes and the rollaway arrived within 30mins and they set-up the bed with the sheets, blankets etc. The website was a bit misleading with regards to the pool, it was not open yet, much to the disappointment of my kids, however, they do offer to pay your taxi fare to the Sheraton to use their pool which we opted not to do (and in addition to the glass bottomed pool over the lobby area the spa area is supposed to have a pool which was not ready either). We had checked in around 7pm in the evening and didn't notice any construction activity until we were awakened at 7am by drilling and hammering and pipe work on the floor above us and other noises which seemed to come from other areas of the hotel (we were on the 5th floor). I think if you were on the 4th to the 7th floors you would have definitely been disturbed by the noise. After mentioning this to the front desk they apologized profusely and moved us to the 21st floor and gave us access to the Westin Executive Club on the 22nd floor (top floor). We slept soundly the next morning with no construction noise. For the Buffet Breakfast a chef was on hand to make omelets or fried eggs to your preference, and orange, apple and other juices were provided, along with numerous fresh fruit choices; blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, pineapple, cantaloupe and strawberries. Assorted danishes, muffins, bagels and toast. Cold cereals, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, ham and more. Overall an excellent buffet. The only issue was a portion of the restaurant was under construction and they were cutting and gluing wallpaper just on the other side of the wall from us. I'm sure if this hotel was in the US I don't think they would have been given an occupancy permit or allowed to work when customers were eating. The third floor has two sets of escalators leading to a nice big seating area which overlooks the lobby and some conference room spaces at one end of the floor and a business area with multiple computers with internet access. This floor had areas draped off for construction and parts of the carpet in the public space still needed to be tacked down. At times the revolving front door of the Hotel didn't work and it seemed they were continually trying to repair it. At one point one of the side doors and the revolving door was out of commission which left one door for everyone to go in and out of. Apparently the Hotel had only been open for a month but I don't think it was quite ready for the general public just yet and apparently they have another portion of the block under construction we were told to add another wing to the Hotel. But the two rooms we stayed in were very clean, nicely decorated and the heavenly beds were extremely comfortable along with free Wi-Fi internet which worked just fine.
