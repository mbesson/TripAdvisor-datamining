We ended up changing back to this hotel after returning from Florence and being unhappy with the other hotel we had booked. The staff were very accommodating and put us in the best available room and then changed us to a better room when it became available the next day. This hotel is perfectly located and not more than a 15-20 minute walk to all the main sights (some closer of course). We would both stay in this hotel again and recommend it to others who are looking for the Rome experience and don't want to pay a bucket for accommodation. Be sure to ask for a room with a shower and toilet if that is what is expected/advertised.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cFull review of Hotel Texas - would stay again.\u201d", "Author": "Rhys M", "ReviewID": "UR127327611", "Content": "When I arrived at Hotel Texas, I found the location to be phenomenal for the price of 71 Euros. It was located two blocks from a main street (Via Nazionale) and a Metro stop (Repubblica Dell'Opera), and a 10 minute walk from Roma Termini train station which I needed on my last day. The door to the street is a self-opening door, so you must buzz the hotel on the box to the right of the door. Inside the entrance, there is a sign that says which part of the building the hotel is in, but there isn't an accurate floor indicator in the elevator, except for a \"TEXAS\" etched by hand next to 4, however the hotel is located on 3. When I arrived, I found the gentleman greeting me, Chris, to be very welcoming. Unfortunately, he mentioned to me that he could only accept American Express or Cash and could not charge the AmEx that I had made the reservation with (most other hotels take an extra credit card for incidentals), which I did not bring, so I was left to go get cash from the Bancomat around the corner. He was accommodating and allowed me to pay the next day. I booked a double room with an in-room bathroom. The room (about 12x15) was acceptable for a single traveler and most likely could have accommodated a second, however the bathroom was clean but rather small and the toilet was tucked under the sink which was a little bit of a hassle to get to and would be impossible for someone disabled. The shower did not have a door, but only a lip at the bottom in an attempt to keep the water from getting out of the shower, which did not work in its attempt as I found water escaped easily and found its way onto the bathroom floor. Also, the shower took about 5-10 minutes to heat up the water. Medilin (sp?), one of the night clerks, explained that it takes a while because the water heater is located in another part of the hotel. The \"double bed\" was essentially two twin mattresses set side by side and covered with a double top sheet (apparently Italians don't use fitted sheets?). This made spreading out on the bed very uncomfortable and had I known, I would have just asked for a single room.The sheets were clean, there were fresh towels sitting on my bed and a radiator in the corner. In the course of the three evenings I was at Hotel Texas, an unfortunate steady dripping sound came from the wall, an apparent leak from the occupant above my room. I complained to the clerk, who offered to move me to another room, showed me two other rooms, but I liked the one I was in better, so I managed. The other rooms were on the other side of the hotel, which seemed colder, had hard floors and the configurations were odd. The second night, the clerk said that he'd tell the manager, but the third night the dripping was still there, so I imagine nothing was done. However, the clerk offered me complimentary cocktails or coffee, which I politely refused. The room, unfortunately, had a window to the street, so the passing foot traffic around 11:00 PM made it difficult to sleep, as the people below were very loud, the occasional street sweeper and cars honking horns would pass. This is all incidental and not a fault of the hotel, except for the location. When I would leave my room, the room was turned over and fresh towels left on the bed and there was always a clerk at the desk, no matter what time I came back, which was a relief. Overall, I was going to give Hotel Texas 3/5, but the service definitely puts the hotel in the 4/5 range. Some of the problems I had were not the fault of the hotel, but they did make the effort to accommodate me. So, the question is this: do I want to risk finding a hotel in Rome for a similar price and not know what I'm getting or would I stay at Hotel Texas again, and the answer is to choose Hotel Texas. It's a safe choice, in my opinion.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bordeaux", "Title": "\u201cexcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "helene y Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR125432058", "Content": "this is a very clean hotel with excellent service and the location is great near termini and city center you won't find better hotel for 40 euros Nice spacy rooms Friendly and sympathic staff HIGHLY RECOMMENDED", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "Ryan C", "ReviewID": "UR120397945", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights during our trip to Rome. DONT listen to the complaints on here about holes in the walls, bad bathrooms and terrible mattresses. We didnt see ANY holes in any of the walls. The bathrooms were great (although the one shower did leak all over the floor) with hot water everytime we showered. Our room was good, with a sink in the corner, which was very handy. The room was not decorated so it was kind of bland, but no one goes to Rome to hang out in the hotel room anyway. Location was great, only blocks away from the train station. Rooms were cleaned everyday. The beds were very comfy, and the hotel was replacing all the mattresses about halfway into our stay. The staff were amazing, particularly the owner of the hotel. Very accomodating, always available at the front desk, and gave us very good advice when it came down to us traveling to Naples.

The staff at the hotel were very friendly and made us feel welcome. Our room and the shared bathrooms were clean and neither of us had to wait once to get into them. The rooms had everything that we needed, and there was no construction work so we got a peaceful nights sleep. They also provided us with a hair dryer, and extra pillows and blankets when we asked. The free wifi was also good, and they had a laptop accessible if people didn't have their own.

I was in Rome for the week, traveling with my two girlfriends. The location of Hotel Texas is superb. 5 min walk from the Trevi Fountain, 5 mins more from Pantheon.... The staff was kind the host was understanding and helpful. Oh, and free WIFI was good too. The downsides: COLD SHOWER WATER. Hotel inconsistently had a functioning water system forcing us to go without showering for 3 days. It did eventually get fixed. CONSTRUCTION. There was so much noise and hammering and drilling that I don't think I slept well for even one of the nights. I was always woken up in the morning at 730am by some sort of remodeling project. COLD ROOMS. The heaters don't work. February isn't a particularly cold month, mid 50s F or 10-12 C....But, we were told that Rome has a 12 hour rule that you can only have the heaters on for 12 hours out of the day. We ended up freezing at night. NO HAIR DRYERS. This may be picky, but the website said it would provide hair dryers and it neglected to do so. SHARED BATHROOM. Now, dorm life is what it is but the only issue I had with the sharing of one bathroom was that the toilet water didn't flush well (making it just an overall unpleasant experience.) Our room had it's own sink though, making it slightly more convenient. At the end of our stay, we complained to the owner about how much trouble we went through by staying there. He agreed to give us a discount for all of the inconveniences. BIG PLUS for students on a budget and for the hotel manager having a soul. I recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking for great location, medium/low cost, and someone with very few expectations.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eden, Utah", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "miciamso", "ReviewID": "UR87530373", "Content": "The location was great, the price was good and the staff aimed to please.
