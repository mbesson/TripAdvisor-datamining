I travelled to Hotel Maas for Koninginnedag. I had never been to Amsterdam before. The staff helped me plan my trip, advised me on places to go, and even exchanged my dollars for Euros at a favorable rate, which was better than the VVV. The room I had was in the bottom toward the back courtyard. It had a waterbed, which I was not used to, but it was very comfortable. The bathroom was one of the larger ones I have seen in a hotel. The room was nearly dead quiet. I wanted to hear one of those European police sirens and back there I never did. Continental breakfast was delicious and the staff were very friendly. When I first arrived I was too early but they held my baggage safely for me while I wandered around until check-in time. The last night I spent in a room with a canal view. It was still quite quiet there, being just around the corner from Leidseplein. I thought the location was ideal - close to a tram route, not on a busy street, and closed to many fine restaurants. It was also very close to vondelpark, and the Rijksmuseum (a short walk).", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood if you are just going to use your room for sleeping....\u201d", "Author": "nickib983", "ReviewID": "UR15378539", "Content": "This place is not as advertised on the net.

We had a canal view room that was pretty basic but gave a good view of the street below. It was not too loud at night, even with all the action around the corner. Also, our room was clean but I did not feel that the rest of the hotel (the stairs front halls etc) was taken care of). You must know what you are getting into with this hotel.

Never ever ever again would I even consider staying in this kip of a place. It should be removed from all web sites offering hotel deals in Amsterdam. I could not believe that it was rated three stars. It's not even worth one. Again on checking out, we were charged an exorbitant rate of tax 13% where i think the usual is 5%, and of course had no other option but to pay it as otherwise it would have been charged to our credit card.

We could literally touch all 4 walls from the bed, and the walls were very thin. The bathroom was the width of the toilet, and no more. We are thin people and had to maneuver around the curve of the sink bowl in order to sit on the toilet. Bending over the sink caused my rear end to hang out of the bathroom. It was very small. The good part is that the room was clean and was located close to the museums, and was on a quiet street with a canal. And the staff was very polite. I paid about $250 USD, though.

The Hotel Maas is located near Leidseplein. This is a lively area full of bars and restaurants and a great place to sit and watch the world go by. We were a short walk to the Museumplein with the Van Gogh and Rembrandt museums. In the other direction we were very close to Kalverstraat, one of the main shopping areas. Also we were close to Rembrandtplein etc. Some of my friends were staying at the top of Damrak and while they were close to some areas, they were fairly distant from the museums. The staff were very helpful and organised a taxi for us to the airport on our last day. Overall I would recommend the Maas if you are looking for a reasonable central place to stay in Amsterdam.

Not even enough place to put a suitcase. So i went down to talk to the clerk. I was told that they had an overbooking and this was the only thing they could offer me. Not only that but they actually wanted to charge the same price for it. Following a very lengthy debate I was given a regular room (aparently available) but for 1 night only. Even though i have pre-paid the whole cost - they would move me out of the room! Nobody so far was able to explain the logic of this to me. Well, they did offer me to book me into their other hotel - but that one was somewehere across the city, and i was loosing all the advantages of the location. My request of helping me to find a room at any of the nearby hotels received a shrug and no help at all. The only thing i managed to get was a reimbursement of the 2 other pre-paid nights.
