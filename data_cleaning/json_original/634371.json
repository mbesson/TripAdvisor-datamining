The room was very clean and we loved the city's view from the room, could see Istanbul from the top :) The breakfast was very nice as well. It's very close to Taksim, the Metro & Istiklal Street, we could easily find what we need in the area.

Great choice (several of my conference colleagues fled one of the nearby hotels to move here). The hotel is in a semi-pedestrianised hotel district (with about ten or so hotels of similar size). Plenty of restaurants and small shops catering to tourists. Taksim Square (with good transport links, including to the airport) is about a 3 minute walk. Even though I booked a single room, they put me in an eighth floor suite with two TVs, two telephones, jacuzzi tub, bidet, minibar, room safe, terrycloth robes & slippers (note that some of these amenities are available in all rooms). In-room wifi is free and worked fine. A good mix of channels on the TV for visitors, including two BBC channels. Very clean, with tasteful modern decor. Slight nitpick: the room lighting is acceptable, but could be slightly improved to give a warmer feel in the living room. The staff were incredibly courteous. Very good breakfasts, with very attentive staff . The reception staff didn't charge me for the computer printouts I needed (although might have had I needed to print more). Since this is a boutique hotel with minimal extra facilities (like most in this district) I can't say whether this is value for money, as I paid a conference rate (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac115) and was upgraded. But if the cost is acceptable this is an excellent place. Note that most of the full service large international luxury hotels (Hilton, etc.) are also nearby, if that's what you prefer.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "Joethting", "ReviewID": "UR42579985", "Content": "No reviews were available earlier.
