When we arrive at the airport, I called up the hotel and ask for a shuttle service. We waited at least 30 to 35 minutes. The driver was nice though. When we arrive at the hotel, we checked in, and it was a breeze. The check in time was not until 3 pm so we left our bags and went to the mall which is like a 10-minute drive from the hotel. We used the shuttle again to drive back to the hotel, no problem. Back at the hotel, when we were already in our room, we noticed that the AC was not cooling the room so we requested a different room. We were transferred by the receptionist right away. When were already settled, I noticed that there was an exhaust vent in the toilet/bathroom but it wasn't working at all. So you just need to open the windows or turn the ac full blast after you do your thing in the toilet, if you know what I mean. That was kind of a turn off for me but it wasn't that bad. But anyway, the room was clean, and beds were soft and I had a very good night sleep. There was free internet and cable by the way, so that's a plus. My most favorite part was the free breakfast. I did not expect it would be that good. You have a lot of choices, cereals, muffins, bread, fruits, eggs, bacon (they have different meats everyday), and best of all, the waffles, the best! I loved it so much that I actually bought a waffle maker when I went home. They have a variety of great coffees as well in their coffee area which is available 24 hours a day. Overall, the hotel was great. The hotel personnel that we've met were all nice. The breakfast lady always greets you with a big smile. And although the shuttle service was a bit busy all the time (thus the waiting time), the drivers have no problem picking you up even at 10 or 11 pm anywhere within the radius (with that I meant the mall), with all smiles. I would definitely stayed there again and I will have no problem recommending the hotel to my friends.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay !!\u201d", "Author": "healinghart", "ReviewID": "UR125698682", "Content": "Just returned from a three day stay at this Hotel and I have nothing but great things to say.

My wife asked for a bag full of ice and it took almost 2 minutes for the lady on front desk to find a bag. As a result, my mother had to fly back to Brazil (9-hour flight) with a fractured wrist.

Really soft comfy bed, rooms seemed new and well decorated, just very comfortable and cozy feling all around. The breakfast is amazing: sausage patties, two different types of eggs, freshly made waffles, toast, cereals, fresh hot oatmeal, bagels, pastries, and different coffees available 24 hrs a day with different flavors. Loved it! Complimentary internet in the lobby as well. However, all of these good things were not the reason I decided to book this hotel. I wanted to utilize the shuttle service to and from the airport for a long layover I had, plus to and from the Dolphin Mall. I even contacted the hotel prior so I had the number to call when I arrived, which I did, but it was an hour and a half wait. Numerous other Hampton Inn shuttles went by me at the airport, but it was an hour and a half before being picked up. Then, before getting to the hotel, the driver stopped at the Dolphin Mall to pick up his friend! Crazy, but true. The next day, I made a 4pm reservation for the shuttle back to the airport. I inquired for the shuttle to the mall, and Stefanie at the front desk kept replying 'I have to check with the driver' over and over because the shuttle doesn't regularly go to the mall every hour. So, 15 minutes before 11am, the driver was going to the mall, but we didn't have our bags packed in time for that so I asked if he could go at noon. 'I have to check with the driver'. So, noon comes around (I'm waiting in the lobby for him) and he says he has to go directly to the airport. So I asked why he couldn't drop us off at the mall before the airport? No direct answer for that 'He has to go to the airport'. The next shuttle to the mall goes at 1pm. This wouldn't give us enough time to do what we needed if we were going to get our airport shuttle at 4pm of course. My husband wasn't at all happy, explained all that happened to us the night before and how inconvenient the shuttle service was for the guests (because we weren't the only ones complaining). Stefanie didn't care. She just said the next shuttle was at 1pm. Even when my husband walked away, she rolled her eyes and gave the other Front Desk clerk a dirty look, which I saw because I was watching it all from an above atrium on the second floor. Not professional. Anyways, I went back downstairs to put our suitcases behind the desk in order to check out, and explained the situation again to Shazan. He seemed to 'get it'. He was very nice about it and then offered to take me and my husband to the mall himself in his own car. Extremely nice of him! So, thats what we did. Thanks again to Shazan. Maybe he had more experience in the Hospitality Industry than his co-worker Stefanie. Shazan told us where and when to meet the shuttle for a 3pm transfer back to the hotel, and not to call. We had a great time at the mall, and 3pm came around so we waited by the hotel shuttle service station 5 min early so we wouldn't miss our pickup. 3pm came, 3:10 came... 3:20 came. We called the hotel, which said the driver had left the hotel already. 3:25 came, and there was the shuttle. So, a half hour gone waiting around, and its only a ten minute drive from the hotel to the Dolphin Mall. Basically, the shuttle service is terrible. You wait and wait, even when you call, you wait and wait. It seems like the driver decides when to go and where to stop and pick people up. I would only stay at this hotel again if I had my own car with me, or if the shuttle service vastly improved. If you are looking for an overnight hotel for a flight out, stay at a closer location. This hotel is too far out and too unpredictable with their shuttle service for a quick overnight stay.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davenport, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with an Airport Shuttle\u201d", "Author": "frankhurtte", "ReviewID": "UR123913439", "Content": "First of all, this hotel is not \"right outside the airport\" in Miami.

Stayed 1 night before late evening flight out the following day. Easy to find coming from the south & plenty of free parking which was a good start. Checked in with confirmed reservation & receptionist said the computer said that the type of room we'd requested wasn't available. Very annoyed as I booked it several weeks previously. I'd requested a higher floor but we weren't allocated this either so we were woken by the noise of the traffic the following morning. Lifts V E R Y slow, & in the morning taken up with cleaning staff & their carts so anyone with cases or large packages had to wait a very long time. In the evening we sat in the bar area for a couple of drinks & a quiet read which was interupted by 3 older children shouting & screaming & dive bombing into the pool & without adult supervsion. There was a notice saying children had to be supervised at all times. Since the bar tender didn't say anything to them, or, if 'not his job' didn't bring it to the attention of a relevant member of staff, I finally snapped when I of them soaked me. I complained to a receptionist who went to the room where they were staying & spoke with the adults. We didn't return to the pool for fear of reprisals. Our 1 bedroomed suite had faulty a/c units so we spent ages going back & forth to reception trying to get it rectified but, to no avail. A staff member came to fix it, a shuttle bus driver who didn't speak English & so gesticulated on what to do with the air con controls. After he tried to fix it, a while later when I checked on our room, the temp was 14 degrees centigrade. Spent the night with the one in our bedroom turned off & the one in the sitting area on but even so it was noisy. Took the free shuttle to Dolphin Mall which was useful, just didn't want to stay on the premises longer than necessary. At check in we'd requested late check out as our flight wasn't until the evening but the staff member had said no. After all the hassle, when I complained to a senior staff member in the morning, she said late check out would be accommodated FOC & also returned our money.

The bad side is that if we been there during the week...there would have been construction noise. Even on the weekend there was some. The room, for the price, was fantastic. Everything was new and quite big. They seemed to have all the little extras that make you feel like you got a really good deal (hand creams, a couch, different styles of pillows, fancy dark wood....stuff like that). I don't know if this is a chain-wide thing, or just this hotel, but they seem to be putting a lot of effort into making you feel at home. The guy taking care of the free breakfast buffet was very friendly...as was all the front counter staff we dealt with. The (outdoor) hotel bar seemed more like a local hangout, at least on the night we were there. We felt like we were hanging out in the corner while the bartender partied with all his friends. He was nice enough...but it wasn't what i'd call a relaxing place. One negative to this hotel is that it is not really near anything. If you're like us and didn't have a car, they do provide a free shuttle able to take you to the airport and a few malls/attrractions. One problem we had with this shuttle is that there is only one...so you're at its mercy as to what time you leave and/or are picked up.

We chose this hotel for a number of reasons, it's free airport shuttle, the free breakfast & the close proximity to the huge Dolphin Mall....as I was travelling with 2 teenagers, this gave us something to do the night before, lots of great shopping, dining & entertainment options there. We were picked up at the airport within 20 minutes of my calling, by a very friendly & informative shuttle driver, Juan. Juan also later drove us to the mall & came back and picked us up again when we were done....I was very impressed by this, as it's not something that the hotel advertises, just a simple courtesy that saved me money on taxi's...Juan even stopped for us so we could take pictures....this went a long way for us! All of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, right from the moment we checked-in....they even arranged our transportation the next day to the cruise terminal. Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be working there, as there was always a smile and a warm hello from the staff. The rooms were clean and very comfortable, we all slept great. A big plus was the free breakfast the next day, especially with my 2 very hungry kids...everything was delicious and fresh. The free internet was also a plus. Overall this hotel was a very pleasant place to stay, a great value for the money.

Staff was friendly and accomodating; hotel and hotel premises were clean. We had a second story double room that was spacious, quiet, and private. Internet hookup (although not wireless, at least in my room) was adequate - they provided an ethernet cable in the room. Breakfast was nice, with a higher than average selection of food compared to other Hamptons. Parking was a bit tight, but nothing to complain about. In the lobby, you will find a convienient business center that allowed me to print my airplane boarding passes (at no cost) the day before I departed. The architecture was nice as well - for a 2 star hotel anyway. In regards to the reviewer that noted the loud music and partying in the downstairs bar, I was fortunate enough to avoid this experience. While there were some people down there at night, they were absolutely no bother to me at all. Perhaps his/her experience was an isolated incident. (I wanted to comment on this, as it was a concern for me, especially during a weekend in which the hotel was to be full.) For the race fans out there: We stayed at this hotel for the Homestead NASCAR race weekend, November 2006. Looking for something that was along Florida's Turnpike, this seemed to be in a decent location.

Exceptional levels of cleanliness, the staff were brilliant and extremely helpful, even though we only stayed for the one night. Out of the five hotels, this had by far the most comprehensive breakfast which was very well presented and not laced in sugar! They also had free internet access on 2 PC's which kept my kids quiet all morning as we waited in their lobby. You have to vacate your room by 11am and we did not need to leave for the airport until 1pm. They very kindly let us stay in their comfortable reception area and even provided free coffee! We had a twin bedded room which only cost $157 for the night which was very reasonable indeed. We can highly recommend this hotel and if we go to the States in the future, I am going to seriously look at staying at this chain of hotels - they have put a lot of thought into them as to what a customer wants...

Basically, everything you would expect from a Hampton Inn plus more. I am a bit biased though, because I feel that Hampton Inn is the absolute best chain in the mid/high-budget category. Higher end chains generally do not offer free hot breakfast, wireless internet, and parking (even at airport locations). I appreciated some of the extras offered at this location, which are not always present at other Hampton Inns, such as the cookies at reception and a nicely-sized business/computer center. There was even a tiki-bar at the pool that served food. Internet worked fine in the room and the bedding looked new, was comfortable, and there were many nice pillows. I have also stayed at the Hampton Inn Miami Airport/Blue Lagoon which is highly ranked at this site and generally charges higher rates. This Hampton Inn Miami West, to me, seemed to be just as good as the Airport/Blue Lagoon location. I believe both have a free airport shuttle.

By and large, I agree with their comments - this place is all around pretty nice and good value for the dollar. I do have some other points I'd like to address. The previous reviewer mentioned the outdoor bar area. That isn't a bad deal (I don't drink) but I would caution people having a room facing the pool area - even with the windows closed and the air conditioning running, I did hear too much noise coming from this area. If you are a light sleeper/go to bed early/or simply don't like the noise, you should definately try and get a room not facing the pool. The previous reviewer also mentioned being right next to the FL turnpike. That is convenient, but be advised I found it rather difficult/risky exiting the parking lot in the morninig rush hour and trying to reenter it in the afternoon. One final note - I personally evaluated hotels (both high end and low end) on how they execute the small things. It did bother me that several days I didn't receive a newspaper and that as a Platinum member of the Hilton Honors program I didn't receive any recognition for that status. Small stuff to be sure, but that was factored into why I didn't give it an excellent rating.", "Date": "January 20, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hampton Inn & Suites Miami-Doral/Dolphin Mall", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d195792-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Miami_Doral_Dolphin_Mall-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$143 - $184*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">11600 NW 41st St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33178</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "195792", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c1/6d/4d/welcome.jpg"}}
