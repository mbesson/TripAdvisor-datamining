Very clean apartments, spacious, with all mod cons present, such as dishwasher and washing machine/dryer. In the end we haven't used the metro as much as we thought we would, as the apartments are so centrally located that we walked almost everywhere! The gothic part of the city this apartment is in, is one of the nicest areas of Barcelona we think, with lots of nice shops and small, cosy restaurants and bars. We noticed the reviews that stated mugging and robbery on the doorstep all dated back to 2009. (3 years prior to me writing this review) We felt or encountered nothing of the kind during our week here and we believe that the Barcelona council has really stepped up their efforts agains crime since then. There is police present virtually everywhere in town at any given time which leaves the visitor with a safe feeling so you can fully focus on what you're there for: enjoying this stunning city... The alley where the front door of the apartments is located is being cleaned by the city cleaners literally every morning and the door is only 8 or so meters from the corner of the main street. If the mentioned problems still exists, we should have encountered some during the week we stayed there but most certainly did not, so I believe it is a problem that has been dealt with and solved. All in all a very pleasant stay and we would recommend MH apartments to anyone!", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cFab\u201d", "Author": "Marie_Georgina", "ReviewID": "UR124854634", "Content": "Really good place to stay.

However, this hostel is down an alleyway off the Ramblas and for our entire stay a group of clearly dodgy guys sat nearby watching everyone come and go at all hours of the day. Eventually they made their move in a moment when my partner and I were not together and three of them mugged him directly in front of the door to this hostel. If you read more reviews of this place you will see that this is not uncommon. I would never recommend this place to anyone I knew simply because you WILL be considered for a mugging multiple times and there is no way you can avoid it.

Recently returned from a Stag weekend in Barcelona, ours was a group of 18 all worldly wise ranging in age from 34 to 54. We booked a block of Apartments, 'Opera Ramblas', in Carrer de Ferran, which were all very clean and well presented. The apartment block was 30 metres off the Ramblas and ideally situated for sightseeing the City. My main reason for writing this review is to highlight to any prospective visitors to be prepared to be robbed at some point during your stay. We encountered on our first night gangs of african prostitutes who would basically try to get their hands in your pockets, any resistance would be met by force. We had three of our party robbed on the doorstep on the first nite between 0230hrs and 0330hrs. For the remainder of the weekend we ran the gauntlet every night of these women and were able to observe their tactics from above as our balconies over looked the robbing fields. even with repeated shouts of warning to other innocent passersby these women continued to Assault and Rob witrhout any intervention from the local police. On the last night we returned the apartments 12 strong thinking now try something, yet still they tried pushing and punching as we made for our door. We all made it through unscathed glad that we would be gone before the next night. We'd just foregot about the pickpockets on the Tube who managed to dip another of our number before our flight home. During our stay and at the aiport we spoke to numerous groups all who had suffered similar incidents. From our discussions we calculated that 20% of Tourists we had met had suffered some sort of crime from violent robberries to pickpocketing. All our group reported the offences to the local police who were inundated with queues 50 strong to make reports. I would like to add that in my opinion the locals were extremely welcoming and in conversation put most of the crime down to Illegal Immigrants. A beautiful City spoilt, not somewhere i would recommend until something drastic is done about the crime.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNice apartment but very noisy\u201d", "Author": "mrpatchy", "ReviewID": "UR23370055", "Content": "Very nice apartment, well furnished, clean and spacious.

We stayed here for 5 nights and were generally really impressed. Some of the online reviews of these apartments had us a little worried- tales of attempted muggings and noisy nearby bars were off putting- but we encountered none of these problems in the end. We had orignally planned to stay in a hostel, but it actually worked out cheaper fro us to stay here. The apartment block is located just off La Rambla- very central and handy for the shops and the metro. The entrance is located down an alleyway that you definately wouldn't want to linger in late at night, but the door was close enough to the main street to make this bearable. The furnishings were basic but comfortable, and the apartment was very clean on arrival. We pretty much just used the apartment as a base in which to sleep and occasionally eat, and, if we'd been spending a lot of time there, I imagine it would have felt a bit crowded with four of us. It wasn't as noisy as we'd feared; we booked a room on the third floor, as far away from street level as possible, and, because we were out until the early hours each night anyway, it didn't bother us. I wouldn't recommend the MH Apartments to anyone planning a 'family' holiday or a quiet time but, for those who are going to the city for late nights and a ton of fun, these apartements are perfect.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "MH Apartments Opera Rambla", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d658396-Reviews-MH_Apartments_Opera_Rambla-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$100 - $198*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Ferran, 7</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08002</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "658396", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ea/a6/41/salon.jpg"}}
