We always stay at the Grand Floridian. This is our 14th year in a row! Atmosphere: Top notch. Love the feel of the resort. It is truly beautiful. Staff: The best of the best. The last two years, we have stayed in Sugar Loaf. Before that, we always stayed in the main building. Every person who has ever helped us has been perfect. Thank you, Disney. Pools: Large and clean. Not many extras, but the children always enjoy them. Food: We ate at breakfast in the Sugar Loaf each morning, though my two boys went next door to the express food area too. Dinner at Citricos was good. Lunch at The Grand Floridian Cafe was good too. Rooms: This is the week spot of the resort. The rooms are very small with a lot of furniture crammed in. It is hard to put your luggage anywhere. A bigger problem are the bathrooms. They are tiny! They still have step in tubs with bad shower curtains. One can barely shut the door when in the bathroom. The sinks are outside the bathroom with dirty carpet around them. I just don't understand how the flagship of Disney can have these conditions. The rooms are worse than a $69 a night highway motel. The rooms never seemed clean. I think its the dated furnishings and carpet that seems so old and used. I couldn't wait to get out of the room every day. Thankfully we had the lobby to escape to. I love this resort, though I am feeling that it is getting too dated. The problem is not the overall property, nor the employees. The problem are the rooms. I do not think I can pay over $700 a night again for the level of rooms at the hotel. This makes me quite sad! I can't wait for the new Four Seasons to open.

The Grand Floridian is right next to the Magic Kingdom & you can take the monorail there, to the Polynesian, the Contemporary & to the other monorails that take you to Epcot. So easy & convienant!!

Beautiful hotel that reminds of the Del Coronado in San Diego. Stayed in one of the outlying buildings. Our room was a bit worn but very clean. Lots of dents in the furniture. Small room with too much furniture. Had to move an ottoman/bench placed at the end of the bed as space was too tight. Finding space for it was a bit of a challenge. Beds were reasonably comfortable. Linens were good. Had to call to get feather pillows as the supplied pillows were not unlike a rock. Turn down service was nice. Unfortunately, can hear your neighbors. Used an Ipod/app (had a docking station) for white noise. Two pools-not as large as they look in the pics but were still nice. Beautiful outdoor space. Small beach outside on the lake. Light show on the lake at night but we missed it! Easy access to theme parks. Monorail to Epcot (with a transfer at one of the stations). Monorails were down between noon and around 6 during our visit. There are buses that can take you to the parks as well/very convenient and pick you up near the front of the hotel. Also boat transportation that we did not try, sadly. Several dining choices at the hotel. A 24 hour option/ a buffet (we didn't try) and a couple of others that were more mid to fine dining. Good food-not spectacular and spendy, of course. Nice lounge on the second floor. A band plays nearby (just outside of the lounge) which is fun to observe but when in the lounge, makes it hard to have a conversation. Easy to park-valet is $12.00 per day and there is free parking across the street which translates to about a block or two walk to the hotel. BTW, our GPS was not navigating the DW area very well. Others were having the same problem. Did not give you and idea which way to bear when the road forked. Kind of frustrating. Would recommend a map. Don't ask for recommendations of restaurants off of the DW property-they will work to keep you on the property. Dinner reservations can be tough to come by. Open Table worked for us for reservations and there are decent restaurants within a 15 minute drive from the hotel that are not related to DW. In DW would recommend the California Grill at the top of the nearby DW Contemporary Resort. We were able to go outside and watch the fireworks complete with music and 3 D glasses. Spendy but worth it, I think. Food was good. Universal Studios is about a 20-30 minute drive away. A decent upscale outlet mall is about a 15 minute drive away.

Also, we couldn't see the Magic Kingdom at all from any of the rooms. What we could see was the other building across from us. Of course they don't tell you that when you are booking your room. Also, for a two bedroom suite I was expecting to have a nice balcony to sit out on however we were on the top floor and although we had a balcony it wasn't one you could sit out on (mind you there wasn't a view to enjoy it anyway). When they offer you an outer building and sell it to you that it looks out onto the lagoon and the magic kingdom think again as it is far away from the other main areas and unless you get a decent balcony and can see the magic kingdom and the light parade at night then you will be disappointed. Also unless you are in the Sugar Loaf building, there isn't a concierge (complimentary snacks and drinks) within your building. You have to get to the Sugar Loaf building. I have stayed at the Polynesian Hotel and it is much nicer (less expensive) and we have always had concierge rooms with a great view and easy access to the complimentary offers.

A little dated\u201d", "Author": "pammcgarry", "ReviewID": "UR125291324", "Content": "This is the 5th time we have been to the GF. Not our choice but for a conference. Last year we had a disastrous time whereas they assigned us a room that was occupied when we walked into it and it took 1.5 hrs before we were assigned a new room. However I am writing this review based on our experience this past week Feb 23 -26. First of all check in was a breeze. I think they had our name flagged as we were greeted at the valet center by a staff member who already had us checked in and took us directly to our room. What a difference from last year. However we were not happy when we went through the gates with our rental car where they demanded to see our photo ID. I asked \"Are we in prison\" We were not given a satisfactory answer to this other than the usual \"It's for your protection\". The problem I have with this is that anyone can take the monorail to GF and gain access to the grounds--no questions asked, but a legitimate guest is given an inquisition. The room is the same as it always has been--it has not been updated in 5 yrs. The furniture is good quality but is somewhat dog eared. I agree with other reviewers regarding the dated bedspreads. We were initially assigned a double queen rm. but they did move us as soon as possible to a king. The computers were down when we arrived and they could not access them right away to reassign. As a couple the king room is better as there is more overall room. I loved the fact that they gave us plenty of towels without having to ask for more. The towels were a good size and nice and fluffy. I did not care for the shampoo as it obviously has an astringent in it and was rough when it spattered in my eye by accident. As some have mentioned, there were not the usual amenities that you would expect in the room but I think if you asked for a shower cap you could probably get one. The tv is nice but their channels are very limited. They had at least 5 kids Disney channels, 3 stations advertising the hotel or Disney, 2 hispanic stations, 2 Japanese stations and 2 tv evangelist stations, 2 news stations (they did not include Fox news). All the rooms have a private balcony which is good if you have a view room (we did not). No issue with the cleanliness of the rooms. Size was adequate for us but probably awful with kids. But then they don't expect you to do much in the room but sleep! Rooms have fridges which is a real plus if you have a car and do some light grocery shopping outside of DW. Dining--see my review of Victoria and Alberts. Their cafe restaurant has a very limited menu as all the DW restaurants do. I told the server I could not find anything to fit my diet and they happily made me a grilled chicken salad plate.They get a plus for that. Their 24 hr. cafeteria serve yourself restaurant does not give prices for anything except the stuff you order from their grill. They have a refrigerated area with prepackaged things, beverages and some serve yourself pastries---none of them have prices. I complained to the cashier about this. Most people want to know what prices are. I knew in advance that you needed reservations for most of the dining but came to realize that there is something really wrong with their reservation system. We tried to get a reservation for 8:00 for one restaurant but were told that the earliest was 9:15. When we arrived , we were the 2nd table seated and there were at least half of the tables empty while we were there. We had a similar case at another restaurant at the Contemporary. Staff--In all instances, they were courteous and helpful. They were almost too happy at times. We had a problem on our last day with no hot water in our building (5). I asked to be given another room to shower and they drove me over to it in a golf cart and picked me up when I was finished. They also gave me late checkout without a problem. They seemed very accommodating--what you would expect from this class of hotel. Other--The lobby decor is wonderful. The nightly band playing is enticing. The pianist is great but I do get sick of Disney songs--no matter how they are played. Also we had the experience where we were bussed from the conference to a gathering at Epcot--something they have done every year at the conference. The bus takes roads into the back of Epcot to gain access. This year we were stopped and a security guard came on board, waved his hands in the air, and asked everyone to get out photo ID. I could not believe that was happening and I asked him \"Why\" and go no reply. Then he went to the front of the bus while everyone was searching for ID, paused and then got off the bus without checking ID. Disney is getting far too powerful!! I gave them 4 star mainly because I thought the service was outstanding. However here are some recommendations for future guests and for the hotel itself. 1. If money is not a big issue, do not use the Magical Bus to and from the airport. It is too crowded, takes too long and has wait times in line. After a long plane ride with kids this could be torture. 2. Request a king room when you make the reservation unless you need the extra beds. 3. Hotel should put prices on items in their fast food restaurant area. 4. Hotel and DW in general should stop asking for ID at gate entrance. 5. Hotel should expand TV stations that are more adult friendly. 6. Make use of the room fridge if you have a car to get breakfst items from a grocery store. You can then eat more nutritionally and save money too. 7. Hotel should think about redecorating rooms. 8. Hotel should allow use of business center to print out boarding passes. The concierge is far too busy to do this. This way you can assure that everything is right with your return ticket.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galloway, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cElegant property.\u201d", "Author": "RRM1020", "ReviewID": "UR125254816", "Content": "We had an extended family trip to Disney.

If the Grand Floridian is on sale by all means stay there but it's not worth $500 a night. On a side note: the cafe is way too small and never has seats and they take forever to make your food. The pool with waterslide though is awesome. Stay somewhere nice and take taxis. You can get anywhere you want in about 20 mins in taxis so stay off disney property figure $30 bucks each way. So your transportation cost each day is $60.

I liked the convenience of catching the monorail or bus to all Disney attractions. The grounds and our room was clean, and we were kept well stocked in fluffy towels. The cons: check in was a mess. I had my confirmation number, but the baffled woman checking me in kept asking about my other three rooms. After explaining to her that two people really only need one room, she got her supervisor to straighten it out. The concierge desk misdirected me on two separate occasions. The worst was when we were directed to WALK to the Polynesian for a restaurant that was located at a completely different resort. Luckily we didn't make that trek, certain he was mistaken. The room, though nice, was not resort quality. I'd put it at Hampton Inn standard (nothing against the Hampton, I like to stay there on business, just prefer a little luxury when vacationing) with one exception--Hampton Inn provides amenities such as shower caps and Q tips, this hotel does not. Hampton Inn also replaces the tea and coffee consumed for each morning, this hotel did once in a four night stay. Want hot water? Turn on the shower and read the newspaper while it heats up (I promise I'm not exaggerating). Want a quiet night's sleep? Not going to happen. I realize every hotel has noisy residents, but these walls are paper thin. Want to know how they keep the grounds so neat and clean? At a ridiculously early hour (5am) they're pressure washing the side walks using carts with head jarringly loud compressors. I mentioned to a hotel employee that I couldn't sleep in this hotel and he made a joke that I couldn't sleep because of the bill and laughed at me. I'll never stay at The Grand Floridian again, and I recommend that everyone else avoid it as well. This is merely a hotel, devoid of the luxury they promise.

I also have stayed at the lower priced resort (All Star Movies) and middle priced (Caribbean Beach) so I have good insight into the differenent priced hotels of DW. Having said all of this, I prefer the Grand Floridian and really feel its the nicest hotel in WDW and probably worth the extra money when compared to Polynesian and Contemporary. On a side note, staying at either of the three on the Monorail saves you an invaluable amount of time especially if visiting the Magic Kingdom frequently or nighttime dining at some of the best restaurants of DW (California Grill, Citrico's, Narcoossee's or Victoria and Albert's). The staff at GF was most accommodating with a smooth check in and baggage arriving in our room. Our only complaint is that the conceirge cannot be called from your room (requires a visit to desk in lobby) and to me that is fairly unacceptable for a premier hotel. The guest rooms were very nice for the most part and go along with the theme of the Grand Floridian (pastel colors, flowered bed spreads, and wall sconces etc). The beds were comfortable with decent thickness to linens and the towels were noted to be thicker and more plush than those of previous stays at the Polynesian. Honestly, I think the rooms are very nice in DW standards but are not at the level of a Four Seasons, Ritz,, or Waldorf Astoria; more like a Marriott, Hyatt or Omni. I understand that the flowered bedspreads go along with the hotels theme but they are reminiscent of the Holiday Inn era of the 80's and should be repaced with white sheet/flowered duvet (more clean feel). As far as the GF restaurants, I will not even comment on the quick service restuarant. It is similar to every other DW hotel with airport type salads, mediocre burgers and an abundance of sugar laden beverages for the youngsters.. We did eat at Citrico's (as we do every year) and it was a very nice meal with great service and a good view of the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom. We also had dinner at Narcoossee's and had a comparable meal to Citrico's ( good fish and wine selections). California Grill is probably our favorite restaurant of WDW (though not at the Grand Floridian); we had a wondeful meal of sushi, flat bread pizza, along with other delightful selections. In summary, I believe the Grand Floridian is the nicest hotel on the Monorail . Its a nice break from the over stimulation that you receive from the theme parks. It also feels as though there are less undisciplined, unwatched kids running around compared to the other hotels quite possibly because it seems like many conventions are staying at the GF as well as smaller families (probably due to price).

Our first evening, we returned to our room to find balloons and personalized welcome cards from Cinderella and Woody to our children. Our daughter held onto her card from Cinderella for hours. GF is very convenient to the Magic Kingdom which is a nice walk or a short monorail or boat ride away. The view of the castle from GF in the evening is lovely.

Everyone is extremely pleasant and warm but the concierge staff was a little inefficient and there were some questions, I thought pretty basic, that they weren't able to answer without consulting this enormous bible of park information.

I'm really on the fence when rating this property. In some ways it was very good, others just average. I will err on the side of conservatism and go with average. I used the Disney Express transportation and luggage service and was pleasantly surprised that I like it very much. You do give up some control by having to wait for the bus, wait for your luggage, etc., but it did make for a pleasant arrival and my bags arrived exactly when they were promised. Coaches were clean and comfortable. Downside on the return trip was a very loud and rambunctious child screaming in my ear- but that's not Disney's fault. Take your earplugs. Check in was smooth, nice welcome by the staff. I was in room 9232 which had a lovely view of the back of the pool utility building- actually, exactly what I expected from a business event room! But, if I turned to the right a nice view of the lagoon. My room was very large with two queen beds and a fold out sofa. I was happy with the size of the bathroom which had a separate sink area from the shower/toilet area. Very nice toiletries, large towels and plenty of them. Room had a mini fridge, flat screen TV, pretty standard. Very clean, housekeeping left cute towel origami. Housekeeping also left me a very nice thank you note for the tip that I left which I thought was really interesting- have never seen that before. Downsides of the room: the walls were so thin that my neighbors iPhone alarm woke me up in the morning! I could hear them opening up the drawers of the dresser. I had a screaming toddler at midnight on the other side. Thank goodness I took my earplugs... One thing I found amusing was that they offer a brochure for the sale of their bedding. This is not unusual, but I assumed that the quality would be great if they were offering to sell it. It wasn't bad, but it was no Westin Heavenly Bed. The worst part was that the comforter was one of those old fashioned acrylic type that most hotels of this price range and quality have done away with. Because the weather was gorgeous, I spent a good amount of my free time around the pool. Very large, clean, many chairs and pool towels readily available. There was also a nice snack bar. The only downside for me was that I am a very fair person and need to have access to shade. There were few umbrellas and they were attached to tables, so no shade available on the loungers. If that is an issue for you consider renting one of the cabanas down by the beach. There was one other pool but I did not have an opportunity to check that out. I heard it had a fun slide. The main lobby is impressive. Very grand, and fits the victorian theme. Lovely music and so fun to see the young girls going to their princess tea parties all dressed up! There are several shops in the main lobby area, one that has sundries for things you forgot. I forgot contact lens solution, and while they had a suitable alternative from my regular brand, I would have had a serious issue if I needed something else. You are very isolated here, and a taxi would be the only way to get to a pharmacy. The one thing that I was really disappointed in were the options for eating and food quality. Because I was there for a business meeting I did not have the opportunity to experience the nicer restaurants. We had breakfast at Gasparillas and otherwise ate lunches and dinner in the conference center or Downtown Disney. Gasparillas was ok, but really geared towards families with small kids. I know it's Disney, but this really isn't your typical kids place. It was very cafeteria style. If i went back, I'd get room service or try one of the other restaurants. The plus to Gasparilla's was that it was open 24/7 which is helpful because the other restaurants had limited hours. If you are there for a few days, take advantage of their $14.99 refillable mug. Sound like a lot, but the sodas at the pool are $3.00 for about a 10 oz cup and that adds up fast. The convention center food was just not great in comparison to other resorts of this quality. Overall, I can't imagine anyone being too disappointed with this resort. As with anything I am sure it is a matter of you get what you pay for. I heard the rooms in the main building were pretty fantastic. I paid $199 per night on a convention rate and i felt like it was worth the price. If I'd paid the rack rate of $460, I'd be more than a bit disappointed.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for family trip!!!\u201d", "Author": "Jorgedearuja", "ReviewID": "UR124174025", "Content": "We stayed at Grand Floridian resort and Spa for 21 days.

Disney does such an amazing job with their grounds, and just walking the grounds at the Grand Floridian is a treat. Location You can't beat the location of this resort. Right on the monorail, next to a pretty lake, 3 minutes from Magic Kingdom and a bit further from Epcot. The location is a huge advantage. Rooms The rooms here are dated and below average. They use old bedspreads and the pillows are small. The beds are not very comfortable. For Disney's highest end hotel, the accommodations should reflect the room rate. Food Generally speaking, Disney prices on food don't match the quality. There are several restaurants on property. The Grand Floridian Cafe was good for a quick sit down breakfast. There is a quick service place called Gasparilla Grill by the marina that has decent options for drinks, bagels, etc. We dined at Citricos one night and had great service and delicious meals. We did not try Victoria & Alberts, Narcoossee's, or the 1900 Park Fare restaurant. Transportation Disney's Magical Express is convenient. Use it. The monorail is great too. Conference Facilities The conference building is pretty standard -- nice conference rooms, comfortable chairs, rooms that don't get too cold. We also had a formal banquet in one of these rooms - it was kind of small for that. If you're traveling with a good sized business group, there is not much to do on property past 9pm. There is one small bar and that's about it. If you have a conference group, I think the Boardwalk Hotel is a much more fun place to stay. Staff The staff was incredibly outgoing and friendly.

Be careful with kids- this is a great property, but does lack some of the \"Disney kid-fun\" stuff found at other resorts. Their loss is an adult's gain as there are plenty of more grown-up things and places to relax here. The slide pool is kid-friendly and they do have kid activities, but with the large conference center and the more mature branding of the entertainment and property is much more enjoyable for those couples and empty-nesters. Location of the property can't be beat- immediately next to the Magic Kingdom- which can be noisy at times (shows, train whistles, fireworks, boats) but can also be neat.

Our family consists of my husband and me; our two sons and daughters-in law; and our four granddaughters, ages 13, 12, 10, and 9 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perfect ages for Walt Disney World. Our five-night stay was from January 13 to January 18. We arrived at the resort around 9 a.m. after traveling on the Magical Express from the Orlando Airport Hyatt Regency. We were the only ones on the ME that early in the morning. Check-in was a breeze! We were so pleasantly surprised to find that our rooms were ready, and that we had been upgraded from Garden View rooms to Lagoon View! What a wonderful way to begin our magical trip. We were in first-floor, adjacent rooms in Big Pine Key. The rooms were fantastic. Each room had sliding glass doors and a small balcony with chairs and a table \u00e2\u20ac\u201c large rooms with two very comfortable Queen Beds, a sofa bed, robes, a console w/ TV and a small frig, ceiling fan, a safe, coffee maker, plus lots of mirrors and a make-up mirror in the bathroom. There was also a desk area with four outlets. (I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to take the power strip!) There was an iPod charging station next to the bed and free wi-fi. This was great as we could use our Nooks to get on the Internet. The rooms were quiet at night and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was also large with a separate room for the toilet and excellent shower. There were double sinks and lots of amenities. In fact, we received new soap, shampoo, and conditioner each day. The towels were huge and luxurious. There was a turn-down service each evening, and two chocolates were left on the bed. (The girls thought they should have gotten four chocolates.) The staff in the Big Pine Key were all friendly and helpful. Our rooms were always refreshed when we returned in mid-afternoon to get ready for dinner. The Victorian atmosphere at the GF is ideal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very low-key and elegant. We enjoyed the small band, the piano player, and the comfortable seating. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decoration, but that was fine. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to get away from that at the end of a busy day.) We also enjoyed the beautifully maintained grounds and walkways. The family even enjoyed the pools on the two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd days \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the water was heated, and the pools were not crowded at all. It was a wonderful way to unwind and relax after park-hopping all day. The transportation system is ideal for getting to Magic Kingdom and Epcot. Even though we were there over MLK Day, the waits for transportation were not bad. We especially enjoyed the ferry ride to MK. The bus rides to Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios were also very fast. The Grand Floridian is not a resort one would choose if a yearly trip is planned to Disney, but for us, it could not have been better. Staying there helped make this a truly memorable, family vacation.

We checked in ridiculously early (around 8:00am) after we checked out of Animal Kingdom Lodge, so we expected to have to wait until later in the day to actually get a room. To our surprise, they had a room ready for us! After a couple of small issues getting a Key to the World card printed, we were off to our room. And what a room it was. I had booked a Theme Park View room, and requested a King Bed, but left the rest to fate. Sadly, we weren't able to get a king bed, but we had probably the best view possible. We were in Boca Chica, on the top floor in a Dormer Room with a great view of the Magic Kingdom entrance, Cinderella's Castle, Space Mountain and more. Since we moved here from Animal Kingdom Lodge, our baggae was transferred over by Bell Service, and it was seemless. Once it was there, they left a message on our phone, and when we got back from the park, we just called to have them bring it up. Easy, the way everything should be. We took advantage of the Concierge in the lobby once, and they were all very helpful. We had two or three people helping us out, making sure everything was set up properly and that we had all of the information that we needed. The same can be said for the Quick Service restaurant (Gasparilla Grill and Games) that's open 24-hours. We went in fairly late one night, and it was surprisingly busy, but the Cast Members that were there were really helpful. Victoria & Albert's is also an amazing place to eat, although it's also very expensive, and has a formal dress code. You'll need reservations well in advanace to eat here. The hotel is on the Monorail system, which is very convenient, but can make for a busy lobby now and then. We decided to splurge and get Valet service while we were at the hotel, and I'd say it was well worth the extra charge, around $20/day if I remember correctly. I would call down when leaving our room, and the car would be ready and waiting by the time I got to the front of the hotel. And never once did I feel like a tip was expected, and they always seemed to appreciate it each time I tipped. The hotel has batch products from H2O, designed specifically for this hotel. I can't remember exactly what they were, but they smelled great and left both my wife and I feeling clean and refreshed. Probably some of the best hotel bath products I've ever used. There are several shops in the hotel, including a few higher end shops like Basin, which was fun just to go in and look around at all of the fancy soaps. The nice thing about the hotel being Disney is that even though it's a \"luxury\" hotel, you never feel out of place, no matter whether or not you can afford anything in the shops. The Cast Members are great at just helping you look and telling you about things with no pressure. Finally, the grounds. A previous reviewer mentioned that they thought that this would be a \"smaller and more intimate location.\" I'm not sure where (s)he got this idea, but Grand Floridian is by no means small (like anything at Disney). It has the main building, 5 outer buildings, a Convention Centre, a seperate Spa and Health Club and Disney's Wedding Pavilion. That said, none of the outer buildings are far from the main building, it only took us a couple of minutes to go from Boca Chica to the front of the main building.

The Hotel is BEAUTIFUL, we check in (all good so far) we get to our room and it was not dirty, but not really clean. We had a ground floor (not excited about that) and the patio door would not work, the TV did not work, there was no coffee, and the room safe was closed (we needed to put stuff in it) from the previous people so it needed to be reset by the staff. I called all this stuff in and they said they would be right down. 1 hour later I called again, they were a little snotty and said to go ahead to the parks that they would be there to fix it. I let them know we were not leaving till the safe was reset as we needed to use it before we left. We waited another 1/2 hour and someone came. They got the safe reset, the TV working, but did not bring coffee and could not fix the door and said maintenace would have to send another person. They asked if we really needed to get outside (yahhhh, if there is a fire or if we want to view the fireworks which I had to pay super extra for!). Door finally was fixed and had a great day at the park. Came home to watch the fire work. While standing there we notice the grounds were littered up with trash. Since we were on the ground floor, when the fireworks started there were people walking right in front of our patio as they had not got a room where they could view the fireworks and were milling around our patio (not a romantic set up for valentines day). When the fire works started, we had to lean out and over our railing just to see them. We could not see them sitting on our patio. WHAT A JOKE! I did complain to disney and never got a response. This hotel was an expensive stay and I really expected more. Normally Disney is such a great experience, but I was just discusted with this one.

It all comes down to what is in your pocket, what you're willing to fork out, who you are travelling with and what you are looking for. On this occasion, we were stayed at Disney's AKL for a fortnight, but decided to try out the GF for a couple days also. It looks beautiful; from a distance and close up. It feels quite elegant on entering the huge, bright, airy lobby area. Service was a little stuffy (not a warm welcome, but still professional) and it was a little bit of a job finding our block (this is a BIG resort; be prepared to walk a little...no problem for us, but might be for others). The room was lovely (when we found it!), with a lake view, small balcony and all was perfectly in order. Having just come from a 2 bedroom Villa at AKL (Jambo house), we noticed the difference in size of course, but I think the studios at GF are of the largest in Disney (with the exception of the Contemporary I believe). There are lots of products in the bathroom and a bathrobe/slippers too...nice touch, but you are paying premium prices here, so to be expected. The pool areas are clean, spacious and inviting. The hammocks on the beach are a welcome treat and the grounds are spotless. The range of restaurants is good and the food is good. The quick serve food court is very small however, and on our stay, not well organised or particularly clean. Choice was more limited here than in other resorts. Of course, it is convenient to Magic Kingdom and the luxury of travelling by boat or monorail is fantastic. So wht 4 stars and not 5? Well, value for money for one thing. Slightly stuffy service for another. And the fact that I wasn't made to feel particularly special (whereas the service at AKL is top notch in my view). Would I stay again? Yes, definitely. Would I recommend it? Again, yes. Would I recommend you to try out other hotels at Disney? Absolutely.

If you're in to the period fare and are looking for something a little more relaxing, this is the place.

They serve breakfast, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, desserts, fountain drinks and bottled drinks including beer and some other alcoholic drinks. There's also some arcade games for the kids to play on and a decent sized eating area. Outside of the cafe is another small eating area next to where the boats are docked. From there you can can see the Magic Kingdom castle and watch the fireworks every night over the lake. There are a couple of restaurants on the campus other than the cafe and bars that I've not been to but Ive heard are fantastic. I've heard its best to make reservations at the nicer one when you book your hotel. I'm sure they'll be pricey, though.

We had booked a Theme Park View room. Due to a special including a dining package starting 2 days into our 8 day stay we had two separate booking. Unfortunately we were not able to stay in the same room for both bookings. For our first room we upgraded to a club room in the main building. Breakfast was included and a small buffet of pastries and cereals. I am glad I did not pay for a club room, the were no great benefits that we would of utilised other than breakfast. The view was great looking straight out to Cinderellas castle. We were then moved to our next room in Big Pine Key. We were placed in a dormer room on the top floor, although the layout was the same, the room felt smaller and the children could not see the castle unless they stood on chair and hang over the balcony. Because we had asked for a theme park view room I asked to be moved. They then moved us into Sago Key onto the 2nd floor. It was perfect. The room was identical to the club room we had stayed in in the main building however the view was probably better. It was magical being able stand on our own balcony each night to watch the fireworks. It was very easy to travel to each of the theme parks. Magic Kingdom by monorail or boat was by far the quickest and easiest. We loved taking the boat, it was just as fast and very scenic and relaxing - perfect for putting you in the right mood. Epcot was probably the longest journey time with two monorails. The other parks were easy with a bus ride. I never had to wait more than 10 mins for a bus during peak periods, however once I tried to take a bus to Hollywood Studios mid afternoon and had to wait close to 1/2 hr. We had hired a car, which was probably more of a waste of money. The car park was a good 5 min walk from the main building, and often had a hard time trying to find a parking space. It was easier to use Disney's transport to move around the park than use our own car, unless you wanted to visit another resort, where you would need to take multiple buses. In fact if you did try and drive within Disney you would still need to take a bus from the parking lot. It would of been cheaper for us to take taxis the few times we ventured outside Disney. As part of our package we received the standard dining plan. It was more than we needed. We usually liked to dine in full service restaurants, so these credit ran out rather quickly and it turned out we had snack and quick-service credits left at the end of the trip. But because we received the dining plan as part of a special and never paid extra for it, it didn't bother us. I would never of paid for the dining plan as I don't think it allows value for money, especially if you want to dine outside Disney occasionally. I did make advance reservations at many of the restaurants months in advance. Despite this two restaurants did not have a record of my reservation. Thankfully I had the confirmations saved on my phone for proof, otherwise I doubt the restaurants would of let us in. We were far to busy at the parks to spend much time at the resort. We never used the kids club. We used the pools a few times and the kids loved the waterslide, although it paled in comparison to any ride at the parks and waterparks! We loved spending time at the Grand Floridian and glad we did for the convenience of location.

Self parking is remote from the hotel with the nearest car parking dedicated exclusively to valet parking... $12 per day plus of course tips for dropping car off and collecting.

My husband had surprised me with the Disney Christmas I'd always dreamed of as I was preparing for retirement. Our honeymoon was to Disney World and this was to be a 2nd honeymoon. When we were first married we could not afford to stay within the park. This time we were staying at the premier resort, The Grand Floridian! I made our reservations eight months in advance of our stay and specified a king size bed. My husband is 6'6\" tall. He is a king size guy and sleeping together in anything smaller than a king is very uncomfortable. At every step along the way I specified we wanted a king size bed; that this was a 2nd honeymoon. We also went for the park view room as it was a special occaision. When we arrived, however, we were told there were no king size beds available! A reservation made 8 months in advance and the Grand Floridian was unable to accomodate my request for a king size bed!?! This is a very, very basic request. I have NEVER had difficulty securing a king size bed at any hotel within the US or Canada when I made a reservation a significant time in advance. Instead of the romantic start I had anticipated for our second honeymoon, we were given a room with 2 queens and park view, if you didn't mind having to hold onto the rail of the balcony and leaning out to see the castle. Separate beds is not my idea of romance. The Grand Floridian did arrange to get us a king size bedded room for the next day, but I was livid over how my request for a king room had been ignored. Our long anticipated, romantic get-away was off to a very bad start. We couldn't unpack and move in as we were moving rooms the next day. While the valet staff was very courteous, moving cut into our time and I was so upset over this that it took a lot of the joy out of the first day of our 5 day stay. We were told they could not guarantee king size beds, no matter how far in advance a reservation was made. You have got to be kidding! This is Disney's most adult and luxurious resort. A king size bed is not an unusual request. A king size bed is pretty standard fare in every quality hotel or motel in the nation. Fail Disney!!! Once we were moved, our vacation became the experience I had anticipated. We were given a lovely king room with a marvelous view of the Magic Kingdom. Watching the fireworks over Sleeping Beauty's castle from our balcony was a thrill. The staff could not have been nicer and from then on out our vacation was what I had expected of a Disney vacation.

This time the week before Christmas. The weather was fantastic unlike the sweltering heat we suffered thru in June of 2010. The hotel lobby was festively decorated with a life size Gingerbread house and a huge tree as well as holiday decor thru the resort. Loved the planted poinsettia's disbursed through the entire property. The orchestra that plays nightly entertained lobby guests and those passing thru with holiday selections. This is an expensive hotel (room rate around $600 a night for a superior queen room) but you get immaculate housekeeping, quiet rooms and hallways and a beautiful property. I also feel very safe at this property. Two nice pools with complimentary towels poolside. The queen beds & pillows were comfy. Love the ceiling fan and the quiet A/C. Balcony faced the Magic Kingdom. I paid extra for this view but it was worth it to see the nightly fireworks during our 4 night stay and the 7 Seas Lagoon light show. We had high tea the first visit and went back again and was equally enchanted. The tea choices are numerous and the sandwiches, scones and pastries delectable! The monorail leaves off the 2nd floor of the hotel from the lobby so that makes transport to MK and Epcot very easy and can also use the boat transport. Bus service to the other properties. If you have not purchased a disney park dining plan even a coffee and cereal is pricey. I found the dining plan to be worth the $. The Bellman service is A+. You can park in the self park and it's only a short walk to the main entrance. Check in and then have a bellman take you back on a golf cart to retrieve your luggage. Of course if you only have a couple bags it's also easy to just wheel them over yourself. Excellent WiFi service. The only negatives were the room is showing slight wear in the bathroom and some of the room furniture seemed banged up.

However, this time my older brother, his wife and their youngest daughter (3 yrs) accompanied us (the previous trips our group consisted of myself, my mother, and my 2 nephews now aged 9 & 5). This year our travel dates were 11/25-12/01. Everyone in my party LOVED the Grand Floridian! We booked Theme Park View rooms (my present to my brother and his wife since they were celebrating their 10th anniversary) and we had fabulous views of the Castle, monorail, Main Street Train Station, Space Mountain, the Contemporary, and the boat dock at the Grand. The outer building we stayed in Sago Cay and had rooms 5342 & 5343 (connecting rooms). I love how bright and airy the rooms are! There is plenty of room and we never felt cramped. I slept on the pullout bed from the couch so that my older nephew could have a bed all to himself. Tip: call housekeeping and ask for them to bring up a king bed sized egg crate cushion. They will fold it in half and re-make the pullout bed with this which makes sleeping on that mattress very comfortable (I would not be able to sleep on it with the added cushion). My only complaint about the rooms is that we could only see part of the Electric Water Pageant from our room as the boat dock cut off the other half of the water parade and my nephews LOVE that show. Our rooms were immaculately clean, housekeeping always had our rooms cleaned by the time we returned for our mid-day break from the parks to swim and lounge around. Turn down service was always done before we returned to the room except for one night (no big deal). Our housekeeper always left extra toiletries, towels, brought up extra toothpaste as well as toothbrushes. Once I mentioned to her how my nephews and niece loved the little chocolates that had a picture of the Grand Floridian on them, she always left us extra ones each night after that. I do not know the scent that is piped into this resort but my goodness it smells wonderful! The little lobby areas of our outer building had its own Christmas tree, decorations, pointsettas and various other flowers. To those commenting on the \"dated\" look...the Grand Floridian is supposed to look like it's from the Victorian era. Nothing is dated i.e. old or needs replacement. There are no stains on the rugs, everything is sportlessly clean and shines. Obviously the Victorian look isn't everyone's cup of tea. If it's not yours, then there are plenty of other resorts to choose from. Granted, the Grand isn't a Ritz Carlton...however that's comparing apples to oranges. Remember, you are paying for location first and foremost at Disney World. I do believe that the Grand Floridian lives up to its flagship status. This will be the resort I return to time and time again. Their top notch customer service, spotlessly clean resort and fabulous views have made a lifetime customer out of me (my nephews and niece tell me how they wish they could live here...I tell them I wish that too!). The staff here truly go above and beyond. If you have an issue, you must walk to the front desk. If you call from your room the call goes to Disney's Central phone lines (not the actual front desk of the resort). I have no idea why Disney has it set up this way and unless you really research everything about Disney the regular guest would have no idea about this. The staff here really want you to have the best possible experience and will do whatever they can to ensure it. My brother and wife were celebrating their 10th anniversary, so I mentioned that to the front desk staff. One night they sent up a bottle of champagne, signed card from Mickey and Minnie, as well as a fruit and cheese basket wishing them a happy/magical anniversary. Another night they sent me a white chocolate mickey surrounded by tuxedo chocolate strawberries since I'm a return guest. These treats were completely unexpected and made quite the impression on everyone in my group! We didn't find the main lobby to be mobbed by non-guests and we were there at all times throughout the day. Of course, their beautiful 30-foot Christmas tree and real gingerbread house bring in guests from other resorts....the same goes for their fabulous restaurants here. All resorts are visited by non-resort guests for various reasons. Plus, this is Disney World! Of course there will be kids everywhere! If you are looking for a kidless vacation, Disney World is not the place for you. I am floored that people on this site are complaining about this. Non-resort guests visiting happens at every Disney deluxe resort. At least the Grand Floridan doesn't suffer from all of the non-resort guests that use their pool like the Polynesian and the Beach/Yacht Club encounter when they are not enforcing the pool wristbands (something the Grand Floridian doesn't have a problem with). Anywho, back to my review. The 2 pools here are never crowded and you will never have a problem finding a lounger. We rarely saw people on the beach. My nephews love playing in the sand, making sand castles, digging and playing catch. I think one time there were 2 other kids playing on the beach. Talk about relaxing and totally tranquil. Staff at the pool bars are extremely personable and very friendly. Heck, every staff member I encountered here was super friendly and very welcoming. If you want to participate in activies then the themed pool is for you! If you would prefer to relax and not hear the music or games being played then the other 24-hr \"quiet\" pool is for you! There is really something for everyone at this resort! On property, we ate at Narcossee's (one of Disney's signature restaurants), 1900 Park Fare (character breakfast) and Gasparilla's Grill (their counter service restaurant). No matter what was ordered by any member of our group was eaten and fabulous! Service was quick and always with a smile. The most we waited for any of our reservations here was 10 minutes. I definitely wait longer to be seated for my reservations here at Chicago restaurants. Transportation here to the parks cannot be beat! When taking the monorail to the Magic Kingdom, you're there in not even 2 minutes since the next stop is the Magic Kingdom. We never had problems finding an empty car on the monorail or having to squeeze in going from the Grand to the Magic Kingdom or to the Ticket and Transportation Center to transfer monorails to Epcot (this cannot be said when leaving the Contemporary after having dinner at Chef Mickey's to get back to the Magic Kingdom...we waited a good 20 minutes before boarding a monorail due to how many people were in line as well as on the monorails and we had to squeeze into a car with a bunch of other people). On the way back from the Magic Kingdom, hop on the ferry as the Grand Floridian is the first stop back and the ride is pretty and peaceful. Bus service is fab here as well! If you wait for more than 10 minutes, the bus attendant will ask you which park you're going to and will call in for a bus on their walkie talkie. For those of you that do not like the Grand, try out one of Disney's other resorts! There really is something for everyone.

I have 2 kids under age of 6. So needless to say the pool needed to be at the very least heated. This pool here was said to be 80 degrees..which I can tell you won't cut it when the temp is below 80 degrees. It felt colder than that to me. I couldn't go in it and both kids had to wear 3M shorties to not freeze in the water. Mind you we had just stayed at a Marriott and had been playing in their outside pool for 3 days wearing regular bathing suits and water at 80 and 84 degrees (2 pools). Also the pool is centrally located and very open..so if you are feeling a bit self conscious in your bathing suit..well everyone walks by the pool. I didn't care but it was strange. The best part of the pool is the ducks that swim in it too. They were here before Disney so they let them stay. My daughter jumped in the pool with them. Okay..next our hotel room was in the Sugar Loaf bld. Very nice as they had food out most of the time and cookies and liquor in evening. Everyone was nice and David the guy that took our whole family to their rooms was outstanding. We had 13 people and everyone arrived at different times. Personally as far as location of the hotel to everything other than magic kingdom..I would suggest you keep a rental car. My in laws shelled out thousands of dollars for this 70th bday with grandchildren trip and I think the frustration from tram & bus travel was almost too much. Example it takes almost 1 hour to travel from Grand Floridian to Animal Kingdom via the tram and then getting on a bus. We ended up taking a cab and paid 20 bucks to get there quicker. Getting to downtown Disney bus wise takes as long and usually suiting in the same traffic you would have in a car minus the extra hotel stops.

I am not so sure I would pay $450 a night typically. Thought I should disclose that in case it biases my opinion of the place. Nice grounds, nice room. We were able to fit a pack and play in the vanity area to give a one year old some private sleeping quarters away from the rest of the family. My son, who was 4 at the time, loved the water slide. He and my husband rode it constantly. I was very pregnant and didn't get to ride. Loved being on the monorail line. That totally spoiled me. This was our 4th trip to Disney and we typically stay off site since we own a timeshare. The hubs and I personally think if you don't stay at a monorail resort or the Dolphin/Swan (very close to Epcot so you can get on Monorail there), you might as well stay off site. The buses took forever to take my husband and son to the Water Park one day. We went to the dock one night and watched MK fireworks and loved the boat parade at night.

Travelling with my wife and 3 youngsters (17,14 & 9) we arrived for Christmas week (21 Dec - 28 Dec) with high expectations and I was worried that we might end up being disappointed. However every aspect of our stay was fantastic and all 5 of us would rush back in the blink of an eye. The ambience and decoration of the main lobby was truly magical and the smell of the gingerbread house (made from real gingerbread) was fabulous. Every evening a small \"jazz band\" played great music and the customary \"Disney Photographer\" was on hand to take group shots around the big Christmas Tree. Admittedly it did get a bit busy at times (with the occasional wedding and also lots of non-resident guests who popped in to have a look - just like we did on previous holidays) but it was never a big problem. The cost of staying at the Grand Floridian is clearly higher than other hotels but my view is that you DO get a better all round experience and, most importantly, they don't try to rip you off with too many \"extras\" like some hotels do. The rooms are great and seemed slightly bigger than other rooms we have stayed in before (at other Disney hotels). We opted for a room with a view of Magic Kingdom which was great but we weren't often in the room to really make full use of it so I might not bother with that another time! The facilities (pools, restaurants, small speed boats etc..) are all excellent and the whole property is kept in immaculate condition. The key differentiator for me was the quality of service and attention to detail. Anyone who has been to a Disney resort/park/hotel will know that all staff are pretty well trained to try and help everyone have a \"Magical Day\" but at the Grand Floridian the staff don't just pay lip-service to the idea but they seem to genuinely try to provide a very high quality of service.

It was better than that. We had lobby level room in Sugarloaf concierge building. The lounge wasn't bad -- they put out a good amount of food a good portion of the day including fresh fruits and vegetables and I liked our room 6127 which had a handicapped bathroom which is a lot larger than the other bathrooms. We had reserved 2 connecting rooms and decided we could do with one room with our 2 kids ages 4 and 6. We liked the pools, health club, and the one-stop access to the magic kingdom. Concierges were less helpful than I expected but one came through for us with last minute dinner reservations at the California Grill in the Contemporary which was very busy the evening we went there (and the food was good by the way). But generally we found it frustrating that everyone at a concierge desk or who picks up a telephone wants to look at a computer for an answer to a question or to solve a problem and nobody wants to pick up the phone and try to talk to somebody (and fully expects that person to do nothing except go to their manager and for that person to go to his manager.) People don't seem to want to take ownership of a guest's problem if they can help it and we found it faster to just go to the place ourselves to deal with our problem and bypass the concierge. The other good food at Disney is in the Land Pavillion at Epcot. It is frustrating to deal with the inflexible way the various restaurants operate (ie: you can't get takeaway food for the kids except to either sit there and eat it or to order room service and hope it shows up before not too long) but I respect that over New Year's weekend they have to keep this machine well-oiled and feed a ton of people in a short period of time. Character breakfast at 1900 was fun but the food is rather awful. At the eggs made to order station my wife asked if they were using real eggs and the chef gave her a looked that said \"Are you crazy?\" Sometimes you can ask for and get real eggs but that didn't look possible here. The Cafe wasn't bad for dinner and the other venues on the property (narcoossee and the corsicos or whatever) were both decent but nothing great. There is this take out place which is not so bad but it's generally crap food and our kids had enough of the kids menu after 2 days. Two things bothered me here -- no place to look at your e-mail if you have no laptop except to walk to their convention center business center between 9 and 5. That's really nuts. Also, you can't get tabletop service in the coffee shop between 2 and 5 pm and a good hotel should have this available if you want a late lunch. We were disappointed at the band in the lobby on New Year's eve -- it was really lame. You could hardly hear it and they were so low-key and seemed to be always on break. But the fireworks outside at midnight were some of the best I've seen anywhere. If you are going to the various parks other than the Magic Kingdom or Epcot via a monorail, we found it a pain to use the bus system and certainly it doesn't make sense to park-hop during the day when it takes a good hour to get between parks. This hotel is good for easy access to the Magic Kingdom and acceptable access to the other parks. It is a pleasant relaxing resort and to the eye it looks very pretty to walk around there. I think we were happy staying in Sugarloaf away from the hustle and bustle of the main building. We would likely come here again.

This review is mainly based on the property, not the illnesses.* We've just returned from a pre-Christmas, nine-day trip to Disney and the Grand Floridian Resort. I will say that visually, the hotel is beautiful and the grounds are well maintained and quite lovely. Transportation everywhere was a breeze - we barely waited for a monorail or a tram. Being decorated for Christmas, which was another draw for us, the beautiful tree in the lobby and the gorgeous gingerbread house that doubled as a baked goods store were fun, even if they made the lobby insanely crowded at most times of day. We were traveling with a party of 18. We were all put up in the Conch Key house, one of the last on the property, and from our side, it faced the bay, the monorail, and if you looked to the right off the balcony, you could watch Magic Kingdom's fireworks every night. However, you run the risk of a spider the size of a quarter landing on you - spider nests, webs and dead bugs absolutely covered the porches facing the bay. It was disgusting. The rooms, however, were average. As in, where you shrug and say, \"Yeah, it was nice.\" Not grand, not worth the price. Scratchy bedspreads, tiny toilet closets, unvacuumed floors, undusted furniture. There is nothing on t.v. most of the time, which gives the impression that they don't want you to be in your rooms! The price seemed to be wrapped in the packaging - as I said, the grounds are beautiful and immaculate, the two pools are lovely, they are expanding the \"beach\" area and even though there was work with heavy machinery, they did seem to stop using it early enough in the morning where you didn't see or hear it. The groundskeeping is constant and the smell of mulch is always in the air (which I liked). The spa was closed for reno, which was very disappointing as we were looking for a \"girls' day\" there. The hotel at this time of year is crowded, but not as crowded as it is starting on Christmas Eve through New Year's. However, this seems to be the week when the hotel is not super interested in keeping you happy. The bar by the children's pool, on the day my entire family chose to use it, was closed. \"Joe\" called in sick that day, and the bar remained closed all day. The resort would not send a waiter/waitress over from the other pool to accommodate our drink requests. They suggested we order from room service! On top of that, someone in our party wanted to rent a cabana for the day. The staff member in charge of that started noticing we were taking up a lot of lounge chairs and came over and mentioned that before we get the cabana, we needed to know that we had to \"pick\" six people to use the cabana because that was the maximum, and we seemed to have a large party. I had been to the pool three times prior that week, and NO one had rented any cabanas, but they're discouraging us from renting? Finally he came back over and said, well, you're not a rowdy group, so if you still want it... we took it because we had infants that needed to get out of the sun, but truly it was ridiculous if this is supposed to be a top-shelf property. Restaurants: We ate at Citricos, which was wonderful, Narcoosee's, where you can watch the Magic Kingdom fireworks while you dine, again was wonderful and had nice architecture, and we had a good breakfast in the Grand Floridian Cafe. Every restaurant we tried on property and at Epcot were truly excellent meals. Gasparillas is the \"quick serve\" restaurant where you went for hot dogs, burgers, fruit, yogurt, salads, etc. Because it is open 24 hours and because you need reservations at all times everywhere else, you end up running to Gasp's a lot. The food is okay, and quickly gets tiresome. The variety of snacks and drinks is quite decent. **** Now to the serious part... this has to do with the hotel and the parks as well. I had the sneaking feeling after the second day that housekeeping was minimal - wiping and swiping here and there - there were things still on the floor, a dead fruit fly remained on the vanity until I cleaned it off... but many of us contracted a violent 24-hour stomach flu. We knew that at least one other family on our floor - whom we did not know - had the virus, and several in our party witnessed people actually vomiting in the park and outdoors on property. The front desk had a runner go and get Pedialyte for our children, forgot, and gave us another family's bottle, which meant that someone else was sick as well! Miraculously in the next two days it was in stock in the gift shop. We alerted a manager whom we ran into (he was courteous and inquiring about our stay) and he hand picked a specific cleaning lady to clean all of our rooms. Her name was Marie Claire and I must say that was the only day I felt our rooms were sanitized and clean. The manager let us know that the properties use industrial cleaner (concentrate, which gets mixed with water - ha) so we couldn't use it personally. No Lysol or Clorox is available. He sent large tubs of sanitizing hand wipes, which really came in handy. No one had gotten sick until we were there at least 72 hours, so it wasn't something we had when we got there. I have read at least two other reviews of people complaining of the cleanliness here and I must say that it is on my mind to call the Health Department in Orlando and see what they have to say about this. Disney cannot expect to accommodate such enormous amounts of people with children and not have cleanliness be of the utmost importance. While we made a lifetime of memories on our Disney trip, the most memorable thing about it was surviving \"The Grand Floridian Stomach Bug.\" It followed us onto the plane and home to ruin Christmas day. Two-thirds of our family became ill, including infants. A couple we sat near in the airport staying on a different property got it as well.

The rooms at the GF are nice but not remarkably better than at Boardwalk/Yacht&Beach Club. Certainly not to the level of other hotels in that price range, but we understand going in that we are a captive audience. One pet peeve of ours is the flooring and finishes in the outer building reception areas. If you are in the main building everything is top notch. In the outer buildings (where the majority of the rooms are located) the flooring and finishes are painfully outdated. Come on Disney, pink tile?? Miami Vice has not been around for 20yrs and neither should that flooring, yuk. The elevators were pretty beat up too. We stayed at the Boca Chica, Garden View side. First floor offered a lovely view of the grounds, we liked it. But room could have used some deep cleaning. The patio did not look like it had been touched in months. Tons of mosquitos and just dirty. The bathroom had some serious dust on the light fixtures, the grout needed a good bleaching and the paint to be touched up. Really all the room needed was a deep clean...the furnishings, etc were all just fine. You would think at the GF prices each room would get a deep clean every month. We have stayed at the Boardwalk Inn 6 times and have never had a problem there. And the beds at GF are awful. Boardwalk updated their beds/bedding about 4 yrs ago but GF has not, at least not that we could tell. We all know Disney's \"5Star\" version of a resort is no comparision to a Four Seasons, etc but when a Westin $149 room gives you a superior bed/bedding that is unacceptable. Room service was excellent. Citricos was very good although they undercooked the risotto. Narcossee's had bad scallops (even the second round the chef personally delivered were then overseasoned, we gave up) and overall a forgettable meal. Grand Floridian Cafe was surprisingly good....not great but a fine meal for $25 per person. Overall we will return as the GF does give you that magical feeling....but we hope by then they will freshen it up a bit. Maybe competition from the Four Seasons completion in 2014 will be motivation.....it will be \"on\" Disney property and will give the GF a run for their $$, I know we will think about giving them a try.

It is a nice property, great amenities and nice, older but clean rooms. Our only downfall was some of the concierge staff not being helpful or friendly when requesting things they should do (we pay for it!). Food at concierge was excellent. WE did Polynesioan club level previously and this is far better standard. The only thing is some of the other guests thinking it is an all you can eat buffet. A bit more, there is a cow bell rang! Check-in was not the smoothest and had to change rooms and get our requests (bedails_ etc) due to the lack of organization. This would have been nice to run smoother considering how late we arrived. One major thing that left us questioning the quality of the resort is due to a specific lady working as a hostess (Diana) at the Grand Floridian cafe who was rude and refused to give us a cup of water for our crying baby to drink. We were clearly guests and on our way out to the monorail and only wanted a cup of water since our baby was thirsty. She refused telling us we have to walk over to the self service area to do that. That was unacceptable considering the standards of this hotel and especially when we are guests staying there, she should have accomodate our simple request. We went to 1900 park fare and a very kind lady was glad to help out. Other than that, staff was great, rooms cleaned well by mousekeeping, close to other MK hotels and restauratns. Did Citricos one night. Most likely will never go again. Overpriced, poor service and mediocre food. Go to the Wave where food is so much better, service is outstanding and cheaper! 1900 park fare is a good buffet diner. One of the best for character diners.

I did eventually book Grand Floridian because I thought it would be best choice for my little princesse's birthday and because of all the character dining events I had booked there. And I don't regret I did...It was absolutely magical...The hotel is not a luxury type but the buildings, starting from the lobby, all the restaurants, the grounds with it's Victorian charm only added to the wonderfull time we had. Disney's imagination and professionalism made my daughters Birthday celebration truly Magical, with all the Birthday wishes from all around, charming little gifts she kept receiving, surpissingly creative and delicious birthday desserts and I could go on and on. There was a little confusion with the room we booked for the first night and we were moved to a different room the next day, but because of the inconvenience my daughter received a princess balloons buquette as well as personalized Birthday card from Cinderella with her signature! My daughter was thrilled...We live in NYC so it's is hard to satisfy us in terms of food but I must say everything we tried there was delicious, especially Citricos, but also lobster eggs Benedict at Grand Floridian Cafe were great and I had them 4 times in a raw. My absolute favorite was the real size Ginger bread house in the main lobby that was made of gingerbread and was amazingly decorated with all kinds of candies representing Christmas scenes. There was a little store inside the house selling gingerbread treats freshly baked on premises. Not to mention delicious smell the hotel lobby was filled with because of that creation and the real smoke coming out of the chimney every couple of minutes. My daughters Disney Birthday Celebration was a dream come true...I am glad I made all the reservations couple of months in advance though, especially Cinderella's Castle dining, tea party with princess Aurora (amazing) and of course the B.B Boutique make over (she loved it).

We checked at around 8:00 am on Sunday, November 27th (Thanksgiving weekend) and were pleasantly surprised to learn that we were given a complimentary upgrade to a small suite and also that our room was ready! I was with my husband and we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. We were checked in quickly and went to our room to unpack. We were on the 5th floor of building #9. Great view of the gardens and pool. The staff was knowledgeable and kind. Nothing beats staying on the monorail line! Sadly, I have to include a few negatives to give a completely honest review. My husband wears out quickly in the parks and loves to return to the resort in the afternoon for a nap before dinner. We requested that the housekeeping of our room was complete by 2 pm. On a 7 day stay, this request was only honored one time. Also when they came to do the nightly turn down, it was often after 9 pm and we were already preparing for sleep and had to turn them away. We have stayed at the GF many times and this is the first time we ever experienced anything like this so we shrugged it off but it was disappointing. The other negative comment I need to make was about the lobby of the hotel. What has happened to the beautiful and peaceful lobby?! The large Christmas tree has become a \"tourist attraction\" and now includes a photo pass opportunity. The gingerbread house is another \"tourist attraction\" too. There were many more people in the lobby who weren't guests of the GF just to snoop around. We had to fight crowds to get through the lobby no matter what time of day it was. We were very sad that we didn't get to enjoy the lobby even one time. There was nowhere to sit down and enjoy the band and it was so noisy and chaotic! There were unsupervised children running wild. I will of course return to the GF again but next time we are looking at going in January, after the Christmas decorations have been taken down. It is a shame because we always loved the holidays when a guest at the GF but now that it has become such a tourist attraction, we're hoping that choosing a quieter time to vacation will be better.

We were there with our daughter and another family for the holiday. A recent review was titled \"Is this really the best Disney has to offer?\"--a view I could not agree with more. I don't know how Disney continues to levitate. The Grand Floridian is a mediocre property in need of a remodel. The much vaunted Disney staff was okay at best--not what I'd expect on the Club level at the premier Disney property. The rooms are small, old, and look like you are at your Grandma's house in 1980. The bedspread was threadbare...something I have not seen at a hotel in years. The porch was gross with mold and bugs. The food service on the Club level bothered me. We have only stayed at The Wilderness Lodge previously on a Disney Club level, but the food and offerings were lame. I don't know if Disney has cut back, or the offerings are simply different between the two properties, but the fare was limited and about the same quality as the crap you'd get staying at a Hampton Inn morning buffet. I must say, though, I did like the evening deserts. If you have ever stayed at a Ritz Club level property done well, you know how you are supposed to be treated at a premier property. This is not even close, yet you are charged even more than most Ritz's. I see no reason to stay here again. So, save yourself the money and either stay at a less expensive Disney property and expect a mediocre experience (if you must have Disney transportation), or better yet stay off property at the Ritz (or whatever) and take their transportation in to the park.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA Disney Favorite\u201d", "Author": "allseas1586", "ReviewID": "UR121301112", "Content": "We've been staying at the Grand Floridian for over 10 years, and it remains a favorite.

It was nice but my parents chose the Animal Kingdom Lodge and I wish I had done the same. Their room was smaller like the reviews said but it was plenty big and the savanna views of the free roaming animals was great The Amimal Kingfom Lodge with all of the foliage was very relaxing and the service was great in their room too. All things considered both hotels were great and I would highly recommend either. Make your choice based on what atmosphere you want. Travel to the parks and room size shouldn't sway your decision The best advice of all I can offer is to use the VIP tour services. It is worth every bit of the $300 per hour.

Room was located in another building on opposite side of large complex and she is telling me I have to carry 5 suitcases, 2 briefcases and 3 knap sacks myself without trolley and that is safer for other guests? I asked for manager - captain disappeared and after 15 min I left as no one came back. So we were stuck- for $5 we got our bags at midnight. Room condition was poor.

After waiting 30min at gate of Magic Kingdom next morning we were told tickets were \"processed incorrectly by hotel staff\", so we were shunted to end of long guest services line. We explained to an employee and she said sorry - you need to get in line. I asked for manager, she disappeared for 30 min and just as we were coming to window she reappeared with manager. He took our certificates ($800 worth) and I asked him for his card. He handed me a \"guest services\" card with no name! Managers at Disney are handing out cards without even first names. Yup. Anonymous managers. The phone number on the card is the general number. When he returned he had proper tickets. When I asked if we could get a any sort of \"fast Pass\" as rides waits were increasing he said \"No - not our fault - talk to hotel.\" But hotel is owned by same company, Disney, right? Hotel processed using Disney system, right? To no avail. We then were able to get into park 120 min minute past when we left on-property hotel on monorail. Hotel rooms were located next to elevator. Noisy bells, kids and strollers. We called and asked if elevator bell could be turned off, down or moved each of three days. Each call we were assured someone would get back to us but each shift manager failed to follow-up until I went to front desk on third day of stay where I met manager John who did follow-up. He said cannot turn bell, can move rooms for last night, but after discussion of above he offered us credit for one night stay.

The lobby was gorgeous and reminded us a bit of the Bellagio in Las Vegas with gorgeous tile, very nice public space and a jazz band playing in the late afternoon. The hotel is very upscale, has a fun atmosphere and very good energy. Our room had a view of the lake and beach and it was quiet and relaxing. Because we were on the third floor, it had high ceilings and a ceiling fan, a real treat in a hotel room. The room was spacious, had a frig, and a nice sized bathroom with all the amenities. The hotel is very well run. The staff were very attentive to our needs for a quiet room. Everyone at the hotel seemed to genuinely enjoy their job and were always friendly as we walked thru the hotel. We would like to personally recognize John Moss, General Manager for his attentiveness to our dietary needs (vegetarian and wheat allergy) and helping us understand the Disney Dining Plan, which we found confusing. Also Tyler, the chef at the Grand Floridian Cafe met with us to discuss our dietary needs and prepared a special plate of risotto, vegetables and a salad that was absolutely mouth watering. We have no complaints about this hotel except note that the Spa is undergoing renovation as they are expanding and it's closed, so don't expect a spa. You will very disappointed. But it is noted on their web site. Buying the package that includes the hotel, dining plan and hopper passes is definitely the way to go if you like an easy vacation with no hassles.

We have always looked at the Grand Floridian and always said we would not do due to the cost. Yes....you can spend your money for 3 nights as we did or spend it for at least a week and a half in the Caribbean. But this was on our bucket list...and we did it! OMG! We stayed in the Sugar Loaf Concierge building. The building is all concierge, locked down ....and wonderful. When we pulled in, we were met and then walked to our building (very early I might add...we got there around 11 am...well before official check in time) by a personal assistant. She explained everything to us. We had done the express on line check in available thru Disney 10 days prior to arrival. The constant food in this building and service was well worth the money. We have been to Disney at least 25 plus times...but never stayed here. It will be hard to go back to someplace else. For breakfast there was an ample supply of fruit, cereals, pastry, cold cuts, breads. Much outside of your ordinary continetal breakfast. We were not there for any lunches. Who would be in Disney? Afternoon at 5 pm brought wine, champagne, beer and snacks. Definitely worth it! We were there during the Food and Wine Festival. We will review that at a different time...but we really enjoyed it. We arrived on Sunday, Oct 23 and went to the Market Place. OMG....so crowded. A lot of locals...and lines that you could not imagine! We tried to get a sandwich at one of our favorite places...Earl of Sandwich...but wound up leaving due to the lnes. The Golf Tournament was also in town that day...could have had an impact. That night we went to Citrico's at the GF. It was fantastic! Not too many kids (a good thing for us!)...and great food. Next day we went to the Food and Wine Festival at Epcot. Don't miss the cheddar cheese soup in the Canadian kiosk and the lobster/scallops pie in Ireland. Both to die for! I also loved the Scandanavian kiosk with herring, etc. My husban...not a great lover of that passed. The shrimp tacos in Mexico kiosk great. Longest line...Germany beer. Of course both being from Germany...we had to do it. The sausage/beer pretzel was ok. Not out of this world like the others. We also had Lobster roll in American kiosk...very good. Space yourself...it's all fantastic. Taste the wines from the countries. Also very good. Went to Fort Wilderness that night for a haunted carriage ride. Excellenet! We had our own carriage/horse buggy and it told the story of the headless horseman. Will not ruin the end...but worth the $60 per couple. Ended with Magic Kingdowm that night. Still very crowded...more so. than we usually have seen. We only did two rides in about 1 1/2 hours. Retired into bed around midnight Next day...of course we went to Hollywood Studios. Do not miss...Lights, Action, Motor. Great show that I have been waiting years to see. It was worth it. The first show was not unitl 1:30 pm...but this time we waited...and it was worth it. Ended with dinner at the California Grill at the Contemporay at 8 pm. Get there around then. You can see the electrical water pageant and the fireworks without moving. We hated to leave the next day.

We (Me, wife, 2 daughters aged 3 and 2) stayed here September 21 - 28, 2011 and had a ball. I must stress though this is our opinion as there are other reviewers who quite obviously haven't enjoyed their experience here. Everything was Grand for us from the moment we arrived till the moment we checked out, from the lobby to the room. Our room was in Boca Chica, overlooking the lagoon and we could even see the Magic Kingdom from our balcony. We could have seen the castle too but for the restaurant in the way. No complaints here though as our girls loved looking out from the fourth floor to the lagoon to see the water parade and also the fireworks each night. We were given a heads up about the noise from the boats and the fireworks at night but it wasn't loud at all if all the doors were shut. Plus it was fun for us as it reminded us when things were happening! Didn't hear a peep from the neighbours or from the hall so it was soundproof for our standards. The room also seemed a little larger than others we've stayed in at the Polynesian, Wilderness and Animal Kingdom Lodge. It was clean, lovely and most of all comfortable so we were more than satisfied. With the length of our stay we chose to take it easy and actually enjoy the hotel and we did. Short walks to everywhere in the resort and not even that long a walk to the nearby polynesian - if our daughters could do it then it's really not that far especially with their little legs. If they couldn't see the castle we probably would've spent every day at the hotel either in the pools (there were 2 but we spent most of our time in the zero entry pool where the water-slide was) or just lounging about. When we weren't dining off-site Gasparilla's was great and it also kept the girls busy with the arcade. The last point we want to make is that you're really NOT just paying for the convenience of the location at this resort as it is very luxurious (short monorail trip to Magic Kingdom and short boat ride back). I won't complain about the fee for the internet because when we were in the room there was plenty to keep us entertained besides that and the kids only let me watch the disney channels so when they were asleep the variety of channels was ample as I was able to get my sports updates!

This was our 3rd trip to Disney in 2.5 years, and we are admittedly monorail junkies, having stayed at the Contemporary and the Polynesian previously.

The Contemporary was fine within our room, but public spaces there are noisy at nearly all hours and it was just hard to navigate around. The Polynesian was a sentimental favorite of my husband's, and the proximity to the TTC and the monorail makes it really convenient, but the endless tiki music got grating and it, too, was a bit much to get around. The GF was just fun -- we had very pleasant valets when we arrived to park, and the lobby is just visually stunning -- huge but somehow not nearly as noisy as the Contemporary. The piano player was great -- even altered his song mid-tune to fit the situation around him. The hidden Mickeys are everywhere, and that alone will keep kids occupied for a while. Our room was in the concierge building away from the main building, and was nice with a view over the lagoon, but one night we went to the main building concierge just to see if they would let us into a room and the rooms in the main building do seem sizeably larger. The food in the concierge area was no better/no worse than what we had at the Polynesian, only perhaps slightly more variety. Ate at Narcossee's for dinner one night with a really nice waiter and watched foggy fireworks over Cinderella's castle. They pipe in the Wishes music for a nice touch.

Somehow, I've never written a review before. Disney's flagship resort is a beauty and I would recommend it highly. Grounds: The grounds of the Grand Floridian are modeled on the Hotel Del Coronado in Coronado, CA with its white exterior and warm red roof. Disney actually improves on that landmark in the sense that all the public spaces at the Hotel Del are very dark whereas the Victorian style Grand Floridian maintains an atmosphere of light and airiness throughout. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with perfectly manicured, colorful flower beds and shrubs. The roses are especially lovely. The property is located on the Seven Seas Lagoon with views of the Magic Kingdom and Cinderella's Castle. The GF has its own marina, two swimming pools and a faux (not for swimming) beach. It is on the monorail to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot and has boat transport from the Magic Kingdom. Guests can view the evening Magic Kingdom fireworks from the beach or the dock. Another special treat is the evening Electrical Water Pageant in which barges covered in lights parade on the lagoon. This is 40 year old Disney tradition and a pleasure to watch. Check-in: We drove in past the security gate. The cast member there greeted us with \"Welcome home.\" The car valets helped us with our bags and parked our rental car. Then, we checked in. The cast member at the desk was efficient, friendly and professional. He would neither confirm nor deny rumors of Disney Vacation Villas being constructed at the GF. Everything went smoothly and our room was ready, even though we arrived three hours before check-in. The Room: The Grand Floridian accommodations are in the main building and several outer buildings. Each of the satellites has its own lobby. We were in Sago Cay #5201. It was our first visit to the GF in which we stayed in a room that wasn't club level or theme park view. We had booked a plain, garden view room with a discount of 40% off or $285/night for weeknights and $315 for weekends. At those prices, a garden view was fine. The room had a spacious bathroom with one area with double sinks and another with a WC and tub/shower combination. There were two queen size beds with bedspreads that seemed to be adapted from Waverly fabrics with Mickeys, Minnies and other characters in the print. Wallpaper features several hidden characters as well. The lamp, which is available for purchase, is a sculpture of Mickey's face. The room had a flat screen TV, sufficient drawer and closet space,a desk, a daybed, chair, small refrigerator, iron, waffle robes and coffee maker. Our balcony faced Gasparilla's and the marina. If you really craned your neck, you could see the theme park. The room also had an excellent view of the Mousekeeper's morning Parasol Parade which was fun. The downside of this room is that it is adjacent to the loading dock. You don't really see the loading dock because it wears its Disney disguise, like most unattractive things at Walt Disney World. However, you do hear the weep-weep-weep of trucks backing up early in the morning. We were traveling with our 17 year old, so all of us were old enough to just notice the noise, roll over and go back to sleep. However, if I were traveling with an infant or toddler, I would not want this room. Housekeeping was excellent. We received turn-down service with towel animals every night. Dining: We dined at Gasparilla's, the counter service restaurant, which has an excellent breakfast called the Bounty Platter. (You can eat inside at Gasparilla's, but I would eat outside because the inside also has arcade machines. If you eat outside, you are sitting on white wrought iron chairs and looking out on the marina.) Two of these fed all three of us each morning. We also had lunch at Gasparilla's twice. I would definitely order the lobster salad again. Likewise, the roast chicken salad, the lobster macaroni and cheese and the flatbread pizzas were very good. We also ate dinner at the Grand Floridian Cafe one evening. The service was excellent and the mahi-mahi special was delicious. Public spaces: The lobby of the Grand Floridian is excuse enough to stay there. It is stately and inviting, yet not stuffy in any way. You can sit on one of the comfortable, overstuffed sofa and listen to the pianist in tails play Disney tunes as little girls dressed as princesses play games. The floral arrangements in the lobby are beautiful and fragrant. The room is well-lit and features a whimsical \"birdcage\" elevator. There are several shops on the first and second floors which feature souvenir merchandise as well as high end clothing and accessories. Pools: The GF has two pools that could not be more different. The Courtyard pool is a quiet and expansive pool that is centrally located and never seems crowded. The feature pool has a water slide and a waterfall. It is a zero entry pool which is great if you have small kids and it faces the lagoon and the beach. While the courtyard pool is quiet, the other pool is busier with attractions like ongoing children's games. While we were there, little kids were doing the Macarena and YMCA dance. There are also private cabanas for rent at that pool. The bottom line: This is my absolute favorite resort at WDW. It is chock full of Disney magic and I will definitely be returning. However, I do want to warn you that although this is a luxurious property, it is missing some qualities you might find at a Ritz Carlton, a JW Marriott, Waldorf Astoria or another upscale resort. For instance, when you go to the pool, no one gets you towels, sets up your umbrella or takes your drink or food order. You have to do that stuff yourself. Likewise, no one takes drink orders in the lobby. The rooms are nice, but the linens are nothing extraordinary. What you are paying for is the proximity to the Magic Kingdom and the friendliness, excellent service and Disney magic this resort exudes. I am not criticizing the Grand Floridian, but if you want that super-deluxe pampering experience, this might not be your resort. If you want all the magic you can only get at Walt Disney World such as viewing the fireworks from the beach, watching the Electrical Water Pageant, getting your wake-up calls from Mickey and Stitch, traveling by monorail or via a vintage style wooden Chris Craft style boat or having your car valet wear knickers and a cap, this is the place.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cThe Only Choice for the Refined while at Disney\u201d", "Author": "Travelathon", "ReviewID": "UR119199422", "Content": "Please, trust me, if you are a hotel snob, and you need to stay in the Disney area, stay here.

Unlike the Boardwalk, the Grand Floridian is not just a beautiful facade and lobby. ROOMS: The rooms are comfortable and clean. We had a room on the back side of the hotel that overlooked the lagoon. You get a nightly fireworks show and a boat show that's sweet and brief. Tip: We stayed away from the overcrowded jacuzzi at night. FOOD: It was fine, the restaurants are all busy and the fare better than Disney average. STAFF: Well trained and seem to enjoy their jobs. LOCATION: It's about a 10 minute drive from the Boardwalk. That's a plus in my book-- liked the additional protective barrier from the throngs. OTHER: If you don't mind being about 15 minutes away from Disney, stay at the Ritz Carlton. It's where the discerning travel would feel most comfortable. Quiet grounds, far fewer families and kids having sugar meltdowns, excellent rooms and a beautiful setting.

When we arrived at the airport we used the free trasport the magical express bus which was included in our package holiday and it was well organised. Then we arrived at the Grand Floridian and could not believe our eyes how beautiful and clean this property was. The staff greeted us as soon as we got off the bus and escorted us to the front desk which were more than helpful. We all thought wow. Then we were escorted by a golf buggy type to our room. The room was neat and with everything we needed. The pool area was great and opened 24hours which was wonderful. The monorail was very handy expecially if you have small children not that we did, our boys were teenagers so it probably wouldn't of mattered where you stayed because all the bus transportation was well organized to the parks. Our teenage kids loved the pool area and the waterslide. The staff were extremly helpful in assisting you with your needs. The only complaint I would have was most dining areas were booked out as most people who go there book them 6 months in advance. When you go to eat at Down town Disney it was so busy it took the fun out of finding somewhere to eat. We did end up one night at a buffet dinner with cinderella which was delightful. We mostly ate at gasperillas which had quick service meals such as hamburgers pizza and sandwiches etec.They also have a laundry facility which is great to use. The parks themselves were good fun, my favourites would have been Railroad Thunder, Fast track at Epcot and the aero smith rollercoaster ride at Hollywood Studios. We also went to the waterparks which were alot of fujn. I would definely recommend this hotel from our experience but do remember that service is only as good as the people who are employed their at the time.Staff change all the time so no matter where you go even though we found this property fantastic doesnt mean that you might have the same experience and it probably matters what time of the season you go whether is in peak or non peak.

It is suppossed to have all the cartoons in the world...! Unbelievable! Even more, I ve been there three years ago and when we went back last year... we saw the same cartoons looping!!!!!!!! The late Walt must be really displeased to have created so many and the hotel shows just a few, and the same every day! The Disney family and associates are not making too much effort to sustain what was once the great idea of Walt Disney. He wanted a magic kingdom and now it seems his family just want to make money. The monorail is good to go directly to magic kingdom and epcot but it doesn t work for the rest of the parks. So the advantage is only for these two parks and it s easy access for strollers and small children and it feels great when you are tired to arrive just inside the hotel. I ve been to the sugar loaf section of the hotel and to the main hotel and the executive level is quite convenient to take snacks for the kids.. and so.I found the sugar loaf building a lot more quiet and private. The character dinner restaurant is always full so book in advance, and the best character breakfast is at The Disney Beach Club Hotel. The Grand Flroidian has very good restaurant but children are not allowed..!!!!!!!! so, we didn t go!!! The rest of the restaurants are standard and the princess tea room is lovely. Pools and slides are ok but not much pool service available but lifeguard where always paying attention to the kids in the pool. I mean, please don t expect a 5 star hotel service, it s a 3 star the most, just expect to be a llittle closer to the parks in a nice, noisy, expensive hotel. Rooms are ok, clean, some have views of the castle and the fireworks, loved to find details such as mickey mouse blankets or lamps, or wall papers.... but bathrooms especially showers and bathtubs which small children use a lot, are definetely outdated and need renovation. I ve been to the Disney Animal Kingdom Hotel which I disliked ...a lot.. and also to The Disney Beach Club Hotel which is quite convenient, this one is the best hotel in Disney... the building is nice... valet parking is good, hope the service was better... Please fix the cartoon loop issue...!!!! that should be easy... and would show respect for children who do notice it s the same cartoon every single day... and add more choices...!

Food is definitely better at the Contemporary concierge spread with more choices for children and closer to all the concierge rooms.

Unfortunately we cannot say the same for our pre-cruise stay at Disney Grand Floridian Resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their flagship property. We flew into Orlando arriving close to 11 PM and we utilized Disney Magical Express to transport to the Grand Floridian. After 2 stops we finally arrived and were somewhat stunned that there was no bell service or anyone available to help with bags. We managed to get to the front desk with our bags and we waiting to be helped. There were 2 people manning the desk and the woman was helping another person so the gentlemen assisted us in checking in. I cannot remember his name but he indicated he was new and he was Hawaii. We had utilized the on-line check in and we were booked in a concierge level however he was having difficulties locating our reservation. After he spoke with the other agent he was able to locate and proceed with the process. I was amazed that it took 15 minutes for this to accomplish this as that is out of the ordinary for Disney. He then came out from behind the desk and proceed to escort us to our room which was located in the Sugar Loaf building a short walk from the main building. He did ask if he could help with our bags but he had no bell cart or anything. Once we arrived we were taken to the floor of our room, he opened the door and gave the room key to my husband and proceeded to the leave. My 11 year old son yelled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gross\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he pointed to a 1 \u00c2\u00bd inch cockroach crawling on the nightstand between our beds. I yelled at my husband to go get the agent who had not even made it to the elevator. The agent entered the room and observed the roach and then another one crawled out from the headboard of the bed. We quickly were escorted back to the main floor lounge area and he apologies and asked us to wait there he would get another room. He returned about 10 minutes later with another room key and we followed him to our new room on another floor. He entered and checked the room first and he was very apologetic. The new room looked drab and dingy and there was peeling paint over the tub in the bathroom, the walls had scuff mark beside the window and the balcony had dead flies, dead lightning bugs and debris. The balcony stayed that way until we checked out on Sunday. Since we paid additional for concierge service we assumed the level of service and cleanliness would be superior (it is at other Disney properties) but that was not to be at the Grand Floridian. The lounge was dingy and dirty and there were fruit flies around the counters and juice station. I do have to commend the recreation staff at the main pool as they were very good at organizing the activities on the pool deck and my son enjoyed himself immensely as well as the movie by the pool on Saturday night. In closing we will not be staying at the Grand Floridian as it was a very disappointing and were not impressed by the cleaning standards nor the quality or overall appearance of the rooms or lounge areas. We will be returning though but staying at our favorite resorts, Beach and Yacht Club and the Polynesian.

You can always get from one place to another without too much trouble which is what we love about Disney. We had dinner at Narcoosses ( Grand Floridian), Citrico's (GF) Victoria and Albert's (GF), Yachtsman Steakhouse ( Beach and Yachtclub) Artist's Point ( Wilderness Lodge). Every meal that we had without exception was wonderful. My two favorites are Narcoosses and Artists Point. Superb! The views from Narcoossees are perfect as is the food and service. Artist's Point is exceptional also. A must try is the Cedar Plank Salmon! We discovered a very nice Chardonney from Fourteen Hands vineyard there several trips ago that we still purchase at home! All of the restaurants wines are specific to their cuisine. We did several Character breakfasts. I think our favorite was the Lilo and Stitch breakfast at the Polynesian. If I had to say anything bad about our trip it would have to be those darned \"love Bugs\". They were everywhere! We seemed to hit it in time for their prime season...that said, we would do it all again. I do have a concern about the building that is going on at the Grand right now. They are building a Disney vacation Club property situated between the Grand and the Polynesian. I just can't imagine what the property in general or the pools in particular will be like with those added guests. Our check-in was flawless ( met us at the Magical Express and addressed us by name as we came off the bus) and our checkout was the same. We used the resort airline luggage checkin and that is the way to go! We traveled to the airport on the Magical Express with only our carry-ons. I am sure that I am missing some details and will address them later.

The pools are nice but aside from being large they are not very interesting for kids. We stayed in the Concierge building which gave us a dedicated concierge staff. Although friendly and helpful Disney gives them no preferred access to dining, events or tee times. They want to help but they can't. The restaurants in the hotel are mediocre at best (we did not eat at V&A since we had children with us). I do believe that value is an important factor regardless of how much something costs. To say that a luxury hotel can't offer value is wrong. Value is a relative term. Based on the cost of a week long stay at Grand Floridian you need to compare it with the top hotel brands in the world. Is it on par with Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Omni, et al? Not even close. If you are visiting Disney and feel you need to stay at the Grand Floridian for the experience do it for a night or two. For the rest of your trip move just outside the park and get a much better value at the Ritz or the Omni.

I have two children ages 6 and 5, so when it was time for bed they needed to take a bath after a long day in the park. However, to my dismay I found a dirty bath tub with a lot of long human hairs still in the bath tub. Thus, I can only conclude that the bath tub was never cleaned prior to our check-in. Another major issue was my wife found an Advil gel pill on the floor near the main phone. I can only think that the room was not cleaned properly because of my experience with the bath tub. Additionally, Disney knows that little children will be present in these rooms and a more thorough cleaning of the room should be done. Therefore, I was highly disappointed with my stay at the Grand Floridian. It should be noted that I am an ex-Disney employee while I was in college and I enjoyed my experience while working my way through college.

This is it...the complimentary hair conditioner is too hard to get out of the bottle. Now for the good stuff... Three generations stayed at the GF for 5 nights: me, my daughter, and two little grand-kids, ages 4 & 2 1/2. Our stay was magical; just as expected. We reserved a Magic Kingdom view room and were booked into the 4th floor of the Boca Chica bldg. When the bellman escorted us to the room we were instantly disappointed in that the view of Cinderella Castle, from the balcony, was completely obstructed by a huge tree. Straightway, my daughter got on the phone to request another room. Immediately sensing the problem, the bellman also got on his cell phone. As my daughter hung up the phone the bellman said, \"I have another room for you\". The new room was perfect; perfect view of the castle; perfect view of the fireworks; perfect view of the lagoon; and perfect view of the nightly electric boat parade. GF is conveniently located to the Magic Kingdom, first stop via monorail and the return to GF is the first stop via boat. Two years ago we stayed at the Boardwalk Resort...very nice, but the transportation via shuttle bus was horrible. The little extra you pay to stay at GF is well worth it for the convenience. The staff was very courteous. Most took the extra step to offer a greeting and a smile. We didn't encounter anyone rude or grumpy as other posters have stated. Friday & Monday mornings at 8am management stages an umbrella parade of maids. They select a little girl guest to lead the parade, of course giving her a little pink umbrella too. This scene is very sweet and an added touch that makes your stay of GF magical. Also, we made reservations for the Alice-in-Wonderland character breakfast (you definitely need reservations). Nice variety of buffet selections. The characters were so \"in-character\" and really good with the kids. I definitely will recommend the added expense to dine with Alice and friends. I rated the VALUE as 5 because we went during the off-season and received a discount. The food is much overpriced, but that is true for all of Disney World. Yes, I will agree with previous posters that the GF is showing her age. I did see damaged woodwork that had received its 20th coat of white paint and the dressers in the rooms could use some refunishing...but...GF has not lost her aura of turn-of-the-century-grander-days-gone-by.

I am a long-time Disney fan, and typically stay at their top hotels such as the Yacht Club, Beach Club and Polynesian. This was our first trip to this hotel. It was a fabulous experience from top to bottom. What a beautiful place. The hotel lobby is impressive with an open atrium ceiling which must be 150 feet high, ending in stained glass domes. . Just beautiful. Lots of room to sit there and listen to the musician playing the grand piano there, generally late afternoons into evenings. On the second lobby level, a 6 piece orchestra plays at night, everything from classic to jazz to disney movie themes. The is a lovely bar- lounge behind where they play. The music is such a pleasure it would be hard to explain. The hotel has several excellent restaurants including Victoria and Alberts, Citricos, and Narcoosies, as well as an \"everyday \" restaurant ( which I think was called 1900 Park) and a quick serve place called the Gasparilla Grill which serves excellent burgers and salads. We ate at Citricos, Gasparilla and 1900 Park. The food was uniformly excellent as was the service. The hotel is on the monorail system, which is always fun, and also has boat service to magic Kingdom. As at all their hotels they also feature bus service to the various other parks. This makes travel to and from this hotel as easy as it can get...its nice to have all those options. We enjoyed our room on the 5th floor, no complaints at all about the maid service which was excellent, or the decor, which was charming. Our room had a beautiful lake view. The grounds of this hotel are just amazing, and they employ an army of workers who keep it spiffy. Beautiful landscaping, lovely pools ( one with a slide) a sandy beach and a gorgeous lake view. A few cute ducks quack along the property near the lake or pool, as do a number of small chamealions which must be native to the area. You can see the fireworks over Magic Kingdom from the Marina at night. A final word on the staff... As are all Disney employees, they could not be nicer. From Check-in desk to concierge to hotel maid, bellman or bartender, I had no complaints at all. They were fabulous, and I made sure to tell them so. be aware that the general atmosphere of the hotel is somewhat more formal than some. I saw a lot of women in nice little sundresses and dressy sandles. I believe this is the big place for honeymooners and couples, although we did see families too. But in the main it appeared ro draw an older more sedate or \"grown-up\" crowd. Most of the restaurants are upscale too. And there is an expensive \"Princess Tea\" featured in the afternoon for the little girls and their Moms and one of the restaurants. It worked great for my teenage son and I. We loved the location. Frankly, as much as I love doing the parks, I would have loved just bcamping at the hotel a few days and enjoying the pool and the views. One note, construction may be starting there in the next year. A new building of some sort of is planned between the wedding chapel and the Grand Floridian, according to what an employee told me. Purpose of the building unknown, but obviously it will involve some noise to build it. Be aware to ask about it if you book this hotel in the coming year, and if noise ( or sleeping in late!) is an issue for you. It will be a great shame if they put in another building as it will ruin the lovely curve of their white sand beach. Overall, I LOVED LOVED LOVED this hotel.

Bits of the wallpaper were coming apart at the seams, the bedspreads have seen better days, the kids' sheets were a little tattered (had two holes in them!), the desk was gouged, the refrigerator cabinet was showing signs of a lot of wear and tear. On the flip side: it was a large room, plenty of space with 2 queen beds, a couch, and had a desk that has a table that pulls out from underneath on wheels (that we dragged over to the couch and then pulled over the bench at the end of the bed for breakfast dining in our room). The bathroom consists of the tub and toilet, and outside the door is a double vanity, so the first person can get in the shower, come out and start shaving/putting on makeup outside in the vanity area, and the next person can get in for shower, so this design does speed things up if 4 people are all waiting to shower. We got a discount through Priceline, but I'm not sure I would consider paying full price if we went again. Excellent location for Magic Kingdom, and if you want to get to Epcot you'll just have to switch trains. Food was fine at the quick service location, things like eggs and bacon on a croissant, etc for breakfast, and hefty sandwiches and salads for lunch - just wish that they wouldn't put an arcade in there as it's hard enough to get the kids to sit down and eat sometimes!

We knew it was going to be really crowded so we wanted ease of travel around the parks so staying on the monorail line was important to us, and, it was a good move -- the monorail access made getting around much easier and also made it so easy to dine at the neighboring hotels (we had stayed at the Wilderness Lodge before and it took a lot longer to get anywhere). We also booked a park view room because my kids have medical issues that would prevent them from being in the parks at night (so the only way they could see them was from afar). The hotel overall was very beautiful; people say it's stuffy and fussy but I didn't feel that way; I stomped through in shorts, flip flops and casually dressed and felt right at home. But, the hotel decor is more dressed up than most of the other ones. So, upon checking in the woman at the front desk was spending a lot of time checking us in and going back and forth to \"the back room\" so I could tell there was an issue. Finally it was brought to my attention that our room in the Boca Chica building had an obstructed view of the Magic Kingdom and the only thing we could see in the park was Space Mountain. Given this, we wouldn't be able to see the fireworks from our room. We also found with the Boca Chica room at night there is a water parade on the lagoon, which is very pretty, but, it's very loud (so if you have little kids who go to bed early, as I do, it will wake them up). The room there was, however, large and pretty. But despite this, I was very unhappy about the room we were in. So, after 3 nights in that room they moved us to another room (it had just become free) and it had the view we had originally requested, which was in the Sago Cay building. This was a smaller room but a fantastic view. I wasn't thrilled about packing up and moving halfway through my trip but we were able to see the fireworks from our room, which was the only way my kids would see them, so it was worth moving. And, the water parade was much quieter. So, I would highly recommend a park view in this building, if you can get it. In terms of other things at the hotel: Pool: the beach pool was fun and had lots going on but it was loud and there were no chairs, I ended up having to sit on towels on the sand. The courtyard pool was quieter but didn't have any features (so, it wasn't that exciting, but, it was less chaotic). It too was impossible to get a chair -- we literally had to keep circling and circling until we found people who were leaving. It was annoying to be paying that much per night and not be able to get seating at the pool. Kids club: nice to have and we left our son there one night, though, it was much smaller than the one at the Wilderness Lodge (quite frankly, I was surprised how small it was, but, it did the trick). Restaurants: We ate in WDW each day / night but in the GF only at Narcoosee's & Gasparilla Games. Both were ok, nothing special. The game room could've been improved a lot. Narcoosee's wasn't the best I had at WDW but wasn't the worst. (My favorites: 'Ohana, California Grill & Artist Point). Decor: Rooms: not bad, not great -- they could use an update. Lobby: beautiful. Service: everybody was very nice & pleasant; wasn't the type of hotel where they know your name, but, everybody was very nice and nobody was remotely arrogant or unpleasant. And when they realized the issue with my room, they really did work hard to get us into a better room, which I appreciated a lot. All in all: the location does make it worth it, but, there are different definitions of what constitutes a certain view, so, be warned on that.

The resort is gorgeous, arguably the best resort at Walt Disney World. The convenience of being on the Disney monorail line cannot be overstated! We picked the \"Sago Cay\" building. When you stepped out, on your right was Gasparilla Grill (24hr food court) and on your left was the marina with a great nightly view of Cinderella Castle and the fireworks. Also, on your right there is a \"sneak\" path to the Disney bus stop and valet parking. We never used the Disney buses though because this resort is on the monorail line (just 1 stop from Magic Kingdom). We did use valet parking (which is a bargain at $12/day) and drove to all the other Disney parks ourselves (where you can park for free with your resort parking pass given to you at checkin). My son (7 years old) absolutely loved!!! the beach pool with the water slide, a zero entry from the beach, and all the organized games each afternoon (Name that tune! Dance Party! Swim Party, etc). They do randomly ask to see your room key to get to this pool, so bring it. (I hear it is a favorite for locals to try and crash this pool). We also used the courtyard pool, which is warmer and near the outdoor spa. Also, walking through or just relaxing in the hotel lobby is fun in the evenings with a piano player or a band playing out soothing Disney classic tunes. This is a wedding hot spot and you are likely to see a wedding taking place. We saw one on the \"Gone With The Wind\" staircase in the main lobby and another at the marina perfectly timed with the nightly fireworks. The resort is known for its restaurants, but we did not eat in any except for the the food court on this trip - all our reservations were at other Disney restaurants. At the food court, I liked their shrimp over rice dish and my son loves there soft-serve ice cream and video games. If I had to nitpick, I would say that each of the buildings does not have enough washing machines to do laundry. Twice I had to go around other buildings to do my laundry (You can't pack enough with a 7 year old and an 11 day stay - you WILL need to do laundry). If you are up in the morning, about 8am, you will see a parade of the mousekeeping staff appropriately attired in pink stripe with pink parasols going off to work!

The worst part of the room- the TV! it looks like the whole place is on satellite. at least two rooms in our party had TV reception only about 50% of the time. Even then the screen would freeze up or was 'blocky'. We found this to be quite 'un-Disneylike' in quality. We didn't use the pools but they were quite popular. Even the ducks took swims in them. The Spa and Health Club was a gem. The gym is 34/7 with your room key. The real exceptional piece was the lounge and locker rooms. It was quite peaceful with a sitting room, fresh fruit, water, and tea. The locker room had nice showers with shampoo, soap, conditioner, slippers, robes, and endless towels. There is also a steam room, a sauna, and a whirlpool. I spent two hours each day in there. Overall, the hotel itself is nice but it's not worth $400 a night.

This wedding cake of a hotel has many things going for it: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the monorail; the food is fantastic; the spa is top tier; the pools are lovely and the employees go out of their way to make every wish come true\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe cast members should really be commended! That being said\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the hotel stumbles on some very important elements that should be corrected to make this 4 star hotel a true 5 star property. First off, the guest rooms are in need of a major rehab. The bathrooms need a complete re-thinking and need to be started from scratch. They are small, dark and poorly designed. The shower room is very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153motel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the space is poorly used. The room d\u00c3\u00a9cor is also all over the place and needs to be carefully designed anew with a top interior designer that can bring Victorian d\u00c3\u00a9cor together with five star details and non-institutional feeling designs and materials. Also, is there a reason the TV is so small? The piece of furniture encasing the TV is substantial and makes the small TV seem even more minuscule. Next up, there are some questionable design choices that bring the hotel down. While the whimsical marble newly installed in the main building is spot on, the cheap, garish-colored new carpeting is way off! It is poor quality and has the feel and look of indoor-outdoor carpeting. This is also true with the off-design carpeting just installed in the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and the truly terrible carpeting in our guest room. The guest room carpeting belonged in a retirement institution, not a top tier resort hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AND it clashed with every pattern and color in the room. In the same theme of bad taste, the spectacular pastel lobby is littered with ultra-cheap and tacky brown leather high back chairs that have nothing do with the theme or place. They are downright ugly and cheap looking. Maybe someone delivered them to the wrong address. They are that bad. Has Disney lost its level of taste? There is also a shortsighted decision regarding store hours in the hotel. The gift store and sundries store closed at 10 pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a full hour earlier than the other hotels on the monorail. And since this is a place where families are regularly up till midnight, this seems like a huge oversight and bad decision. People want to shop, need items they have forgotten, and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most exclusive hotel have the stores with the longest hours and best merchandise? Well, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Why focus on such detail, because five star hotels stand above the rest because all the right choices are made \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they are not being made here. More reasons for choosing this hotel? You can walk to the always kitschy-yet-wonderful Polynesian; the turndown service with chocolates is a nice touch; the lakeside pool is relaxing and just the right touch; the marina offer great boat rentals; and the great employees. Confused? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be. There simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a 5 star hotel on property.

The Christmas decorations in the main building are just breathtaking including a life sized gingerbread house from which they sell gingerbread cookies. There is either a pianist or orchestra playing each night; we enjoyed watching all the young children (ours included) dance in the middle of the enormous lobby. There are many couches and lounge chairs where people can sit and enjoy the atmosphere. The grounds are spotless. There are views of Cinderella's castle from the hotel. There are also wonderful shops in the main building that I enjoyed milling through in the evenings. We enjoyed the pool located closest to the beach. It was a basic pool but it is surrounded by such grandeur that it was enjoyable to sit. It also had zero entry which was great for our learning swimmers.

Was it such a magical experience that I feel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m spoiled for any other Disney hotel? No. But was it nice enough that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d really have to think hard about picking another Disney hotel over it? Yes. Best part? I celebrated a birthday while I was in Disney and was greeted in my room by a prettily displayed complimentary box of chocolates and a card. Very, very nice of them. Now the nitty gritty. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read some write-ups sayings saying the staff was snooty, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience that. I did feel the two people at the front desk that I dealt with weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the warmest people. Polite, did their job, but they seemed diffident more than anything. However, all the other staff I dealt with (waiters, maintenance, the guys in knee pants who walk around, room attendants) were extremely nice and very personable. I will say that I did see other guests being escorted to their rooms on day one, whereas I got some vague directions and a map. At other times, guests were really getting the extra mile while I was left to sit and figure it out on my own. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it was because they had kids with them (I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) or if I happened to see those with concierge service and their boots were being licked. It did cause some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moments for me though. I stayed in room 3722 in the Conch Key building. The lobby there was always quiet and I only ever had to share the very fast elevator twice during my entire stay. The room was pretty with comfortable beds, great a/c and a marble bathroom. But it had obvious signs of wear (the round part of the Mickey lamp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nose was broken off, scuffed wall paper, cracked sink vanity, frayed carpet edge going into the bathroom, black stains on the sofa and bedding) that were not consistent with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation or price point. Plus the mini fridge never worked and when I complained to the room attendant, he seemed unsure how to go about fixing the problem (uh, replace it). I assumed it would be taken care of while I was at the park the next day, but for my entire stay the fridge was out of order. I spotted cracker crumbs behind the chair while searching for a way onto the balcony (they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t from me so they had to be from a previous guest) and they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cleaned up during my visit either. Are these huge problems? No. Should a hotel this expensive have them at all let alone not correct them asap? No. The room was relatively quiet. The main noises I heard were the flush of surrounding toilets (they are extremely loud), the honk of the ferry as it came to the dock and the noisy guy across the hall who seemed to have loud conversations with his numerous guest every night at 11. That only lasted 2 nights and he either checked out or was spoken to. While there, I ate at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and Gasparilla Grille. On my first night I ate dinner at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and it gave a good and bad impression. The food was outstanding: tasty pork chop with roasted corn, snap peas and tomatoes that were obviously farm fresh; followed by the dessert sampler (which they say feeds 2, but each dessert is two bites so if you have a big eater with you, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on sharing). Trouble was my waiter was incredibly slow. It took forever for him to take my order and forever for him to bring anything out, especially dessert. Meanwhile, the other servers were flying around and people who arrived after me were out the door well before me. I ate breakfast there twice (much faster service) and can recommend the french toast, but not the pancakes. I had one full breakfast at Gasparilla with a not so hot (in temp) breakfast sandwich and gross fountain drink (they suck park wide as they are part of the dining plan, avoid them) that was WAY over priced (the gross fountain drink also cost a fortune, which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know). However, the next time I ate there, I bought a pint of milk from their fridge and a large cinnamon bun and it was both tasty and cheap. I also did tea in the Garden View Tea Room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done high tea before and would rate this tea experience as a 5 out of ten. Dry bread on the sandwiches and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you what the sandwich flavors are until they are served (one was shrimp salad and I hate shrimp). The scones were good, but you only get one. You also only get two tiny desserts. Now the tea blend I had, Princess Breakfast Tea, was the best hot tea ever as it had strawberry and vanilla tones to it. However, for $24 I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the tea was worth it and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it again. I was expecting a tea set up out of a fairytale and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had better at a local tea house. Transportation was the biggest issue. While I never had that long of a wait for a bus or the monorail, and only had to stand once, the Floridian is the last stop on any mode of transportation except for the ferry from Magic Kingdom where the hotel is dropped off first. Which means before you can go to bed at night, you have to endure three monorail stops and if you are trying to get to Epcot from the hotel, you have to get off at transportation, go down the long ramp and walk up another ramp to wait for the monorail taking you to Epcot. And then you have a very long walk through the park if you want to get to the World Showcase. Or else you can take 1.5 hour bus ride and then a ferry to the World Showcase. The trouble with the buses is that while it may say it has stops at two places, it will also unexpectedly stop at a water park and two other hotels along the way, making for a long ride. Now this is a Disney issue and not a hotel issue, but if you are looking for quick commutes, the Floridian really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that quick. The monorail stops at the Contemporary, transportation and the Polynesian first on its way back to the Floridian from the Magic Kingdom and a stop at transportation before reaching the Magic Kingdom if departing from the hotel. The easiest way into Epcot would be to stay at the Beach Club, Yacht Club or Boardwalk hotels where a five minute ferry ride or a short walk has you at the World Showcase. There needs to be an easier way to get from the Floridian to the World Showcase, like a bus that drops you at the ferry by the Epcot hotels or something that picks you up at the Epcot monorail depot and transports you to the back. Not to sound lazy, but the hotter it gets, the longer that walk becomes. Right now the only easy way is to stay elsewhere. I only used one of the pools, but was grossed out by the ducks swimming in it so I got out quickly. Not sure how they'd keep the ducks out, but something needs to be done as they leave feces in the pool. Ick! Tried the hot tub, but it was practically scalding and not what you want during August in Florida. The one outstanding thing I saw happened to another guest, but deserves note. The piano player was doing modern songs, but spotted a little girl walking through with her family and broke into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for her. When he was done, the little girl ran over and hugged him. He then played two other children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s songs from Disney for her, receiving a hug for each and then she brought over her Cinderella gown to show him. The guy was wonderful to her and it was really heartwarming to see. There is also an oddity in the lobby that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out until an internet search explained it. Every time I went through the main lobby, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see an older woman sitting by herself, staring into space. Because of her heavy make-up, basket of stuffed animals and odd clothing, I thought she was a character out of a movie, but she never interacted with guests, just staff. I speculated that she was homeless or a crazy, but hoped the hotel wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow someone like that to hang about so I chalked her up as an odd guest. Turns out she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neither a character or a guest, just an odd person who goes there every day with a basket of teddy bears to listen to the music. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice that they allow her to do that, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unsettling. Yeah, anyone can visit the hotels, lobbies aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just for hotel guests, but it is weird behavior and there are children around. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do anything, but why take a risk? She made me uncomfortable before I knew what her deal was, and knowing it now, it still weirds me out a bit. Check out was a breeze, they had my boarding pass on my door knob before I was even up on my last day. All I had to do was make a call to pay my baggage fee and take my checked suitcase to the front and I was done. Not sure if this is a Floridian thing or a Disney thing, but it rocked. All in all, I liked the Grand Floridian. I loved that there were minimal children, rare in Disney, so that would give me pause before booking another hotel, but the Floridian is really only convenient for Magic Kingdom. There was nothing that ruined the visit, but there was nothing that made me swoon either. The hotel is supposed to be Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship resort and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure it lives up to its reputation any longer. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be one of those fading dames where guests wind up paying more for its name than its experience.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse NY", "Title": "\u201cNice, but....\u201d", "Author": "SamiParty", "ReviewID": "UR116300382", "Content": "If you don't stay in the main building, it is really like staying in a regular hotel.

Service was outstanding - at entrance security took our details and someone was waiting to greet us personally in front of the hotel and take us to check in, which was very efficient (always seemed to be plenty of staff free on the desk to deal with people). Bell service took us to our room immediately in a little cart. Check out was very easy and quick (an invoice left on our room door handle). Maid service was outstanding, oodles of towels and toiletries and even sculptures of mickey and other animals cleverly made from towels. pool and beach were lovely but close during rain storms so you are left in limbo as to what to do. Bus service was good and shared with polynesian and sometimes contemporary/wilderness lodge meaning a good 45 minute journey to/from the likes of downtown or animal kingdom. you cant walk to Magic kingdom but its a very short 2 minute monorail ride. you can walk to the polynesian. the tennis courts were being refurbished but we could use those at the contemporary free of charge. breakfast/service in the restaurant was good but the menu was limited (and theres no buffet). narcoosees the restaurant overlooking the lake has excellent but expensive food and views and fast efficient child friendly service in contrast to citricos. boat service to MK goes via polynesian so suggest you only use if not in a hurry or on the way back from MK.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wake Forest, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cOnly 5 stars in Disney's \"Make Believe\" World\u201d", "Author": "cpwife", "ReviewID": "UR116084398", "Content": "It is not a 5 star resort by usual standards - think Ritz, Four Seasons, etc. The hotel is showing its age with torn wallpaper, chipped paint and overall tiredness.

As soon as you turn into the drive and see the hotel close up for the first time you know you've made the right decision. We were greeted off the magical express and walked directly to the check -in and within 15 mins of arrival we were off to our room. The lobby is beautiful ,try to remember to take note of the beautiful smell as you enter for the first time. The grounds are gorgeous and as with the entire property are spotlessly clean and well tended. We had a garden view room in Sago Cay which was very comfortable,had a fridge and we loved the little towel animals that mouskeeping sometimes left for us. The pools are great with an endless supply of towels and we were always able to get a sun lounger no matter what time of day we went to the pool. We rented a cabana at the beach pool and that was a lovely treat. The attendants were marvelous and while we lay relaxing they brought us lunch and drinks and a steady supply of water and anything we needed. We ate at Narcoossees, Citricos and the Grand Floridian Cafe and would recommend all of them. We had afternoon tea at the Garden View tea room and thoroughly enjoyed that experience. We loved Gasperilla's for the times that you want something quick and don't want to have to go to a restaurant for it. It was great for picking up snacks ,drinks cups of coffee. Transportation to the Magic Kingdom is so easy either by monorail or boat . We had no car and used Disney transportation to get to all of the other parks and found it to be efficient ,clean and so simple. In the evening once it gets dark you can watch the Electric Water Pageant from the beach and then settle down to watch a movie on the beach. You get a great view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the boat dock or get dessert from Gasperillas and sit outside and enjoy them from there. The Floridian never seemed crowded ,all staff were really friendly and helpful.

She gets what she needs but is made to feel like a burden in the process. That was not the case at the Grand Floridian, or at any of the Disney properties we visited.

It was taken care of before we were seated so she could just roll up to the table.

We stayed a week at the end of June 2011. The hotel without question is absolutely stunning and the public areas are breath taking. We had a standard marina view room. Perfectly adequate for a family of four or five. To be honest you are not at Disney to sit in your room. We did hear a bit of corridor noise but nothing dramatic. What is an absolute must when staying at any Disney resort in my opinion is the Disney deluxe dining programme. This entitles you to eat anywhere across the entire resort. I was dubious about this at first but after the first day I did my maths. My savings were in four figures (dollars, euros or sterling). We were entitled to a character breakfast every day which we did plus we ate at Narcossees or Citricos every evening plus free sodas all day long in the resort and several snacks per person per day. If you timed it right you can sit and watch the fireworks while you eat The only extras I paid for were the gratuity and a bottle of wine. Absolutely fantastic value and it made our holiday. In my opinion your hard earned cash pays better dividends on the dining plans than upgrading your room including conciege levels - paticularly at Disney when you use the room to just sleep and wash. Cleanliness of the hotel is good and the staff in general very helpful. The hotel is extremely close to the Magic Kingdom so even if you are late getting up you are still in before the ride queues become too excessive. Transport to the other parks is also fast and efficient. The only complaint I would have is the fastpass system. Basically everyone has it. Therefore do not go with the assumption that its a perk because it is not. Particularly with the popular rides, I found out that on Space Mountain for example it was better to queue in standby than use the fastpass. Some of the fastpass times to come back were 5 hours. Better still use magic hours particularly late at night and the queue times dwindle to 20 minutes at most.

That pretty sums up our experience in The Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. We've stayed here on 4 occasions now (not including my now wife, she had never stayed before) and in all honesty, this recent trip has to be the winner. We visited to celebrate my parents 30th wedding anniversary. May seem a little childish - 5 grown ups heading to Disney for a week but in all honesty, there is no alternate reality like it. It was the only place to go. After the long and frankly disappointing flight in Premium Economy - Virgin, take note from Emirates, you've a lot to learn - we arrived at Orlando Intl to then be ripped off by the Alamo car hire. The term of which stayed for the rest of the holiday - if something proved expensive, you'd been 'alamo'd'. Safe to say not a great start to the holiday but it's very difficult to wipe the smile off your face when your next location is Disney World. We drove our minivan and pulled up to the Magic Kingdom gate to be waved on through, continuing to follow signs for The Grand Floridian. This marks the beginning of the experience. The road signs have already changed, there are Disney buses, and you see the monorail for the first time. Our arrival at the hotel was greeted by the old chap who's greeted us every time we've visited. We were amazed he was still going! But however amazing he is, nothing compares to the smell, sights and sounds of that first walk in. The pristine lobby with the new marble floor, the band playing up on the balcony or the pianist sat doing his thing. It's incredible - a full multi sensory experience. Check in was smooth, rooms were ready on time and we were in, unpacked and heading The Magic Kingdom in the space of an hour. This is where a bit of Disney magic took place. We had arranged prior to our arrival for the Disney Florist to head into my parents room and decorate it with one of the room decoration gifts. When we finally got back to the hotel that night, my parents were blown away (not literally, but there were tears). The room looked spectacular and the gifts were stunning. Highly recommend getting in touch with the Florist if you have a special occasion. They will arrange something truly magical. The rooms were as usual, stunning and super clean. With big beds, a big bathroom with double sinks and a great shower. Only thing missing this time was the mini bar which had been replaced in all Disney hotels with a simple but empty fridge. The housekeeping service was top notch, as was the evening turn down. Not much better in this world than coming home form a long day in one of the theme parks to a nicely turned down bed, a tasty chocolate and a very Disney good-night note. Lovely! We were staying in the Boca Chica building, just behind the bar area of the central pool. It is this main pool that is actually the Disney's Imagineers least favourite. Apparently, it is too plain/bland. I have to say, I disagree. The nearest pool was the this very pool and it was fantastic. Big enough for a long swim, right next to the bar and bizarrely, full of ducks and the odd Disney character. We didn't get to use the spa - too much rollercoaster riding, but from other reviews, it sounds fantastic. Food - The Grand Floridian Caf\u00c3\u00a9 was wonderful. The menu had changed a little since our previous visit (5 yrs prior) but it was still great. So great in fact that i would go as far as to say it's the best food in Disney in that price bracket. The steak was cooked to perfection and the Parmesan frits were possibly the most addictive food i'd ever eaten. On top of the food being lovely, the service was impeccable too. My wife had a moment where the maitres d' had realised she was wearing a black dress. He ran off and reappeared with a black napkin to match, rather than the usual white. Nice little touch. The 1900 park fare character meals are ok. There's a fair bit of choice in the buffet but in my opinion this is much better for kids, not 5 adults. We still enjoyed it but would have perhaps enjoyed it more if i was 8. The Gasparilla Grill was a fast food place. We had most breakfasts in there as we were always rushing in the morning - long days in Disney World mean a lot of sleep if you can get it! We didn't eat in there any evenings or lunches. We did partake in ice cream most nights for the fireworks. Self serve - winner. Citrico's is nice if a little expensive. The expensive part goes hand in hand with the hotel and being in Disney but it was a bit much. The food was lovely but we didn't go out of our way to eat there a second time. We would also tend to go and grab an early evening drink at Mizners Lounge. Great ambience in there and some very nice drinks available. The monorail never faltered and in all fairness i could probably listen to the guy on the audio system all day. \"Please stand clear of the doors...\". Not only that but the air-con is mega and always welcome! Same on the buses. All in all, the Disney transportation was always on time and always comfortable. Check out, like everything else was smooth and easy. The bill was posted under the door the night before our departure (that bit wasn't too much fun) and that was about it. I won't bore you with info on the parks. I'll save that for another review on another day. What i will finish on is this. If you have an opportunity to go and stay at The Grand Floridian do it. While The Contemporary and The Polynesian look great, The Grand really takes the biscuit. Yes it's expensive but aren't they all?

There should be a normal European style breakfast restaurant. Absurd that you can't find this in a deluxe resort. We were lucky to stay club level and somehow there they do manage to offer a healthy breakfast and healthy snacks, so why not for everybody? Even if we can pay for this, not everybody is interested in eggs, sausages, pancakes and other fat things. So far the negative side, because believe it or not, the hotel is something special with the pools, the spa, the marina, the beach, grounds, lobby etc. So please add a decent buffet breakfast, add free wifi and offer fast and luxurious transportation and it's worth the price you're paying for now!

I have been coming here since I was very little. I will go through exactly what happened during my stay from July 1st- July 5th, 2011. Check-in: Since we already were in Disney, we didn't use the Magical Express service to get from the airport to the Grand Floridian. We used a taxi from the Contemporary (gross) to here. Boy, was it a breath of fresh air! At the guard stand, a woman greeted us, asked for our name, and told us someone would be there to assist with luggage at the Porte Cochere. When we pulled up, the bell captain opened the door and had one of the uniformed-bell boys take our luggage. Then, a cute girl (can't remember her name) asked if we were the \"Smith\" party and welcomed us back. At the front desk, there was no wait. We were lead to someone who was training (oh, great.) However, she was efficient with the whole process. She did honor our request of being in Boca Chica on a high floor very well (we were in Conch Key... not my favorite.) She gave us our welcome packet, and we were lead off to another bellman on a trolley. Okay, this is service. While driving us to the room, he told us about the history of the resort, where everything was, and about the future addition to the Grand Floridian. We pulled up to Boca Chica (an excellent building, by the way) and went up to room 8406 on the 4th floor. It was a dormer room, which I had never stayed in. The bellman (Jim) was absolutely wonderful. He brought our luggage up and even brought us ice and bottled water (the real feel temperature was 106.) SUCCESS! The Room: Okay, here is where we start having a few minor issues. From first glance, everything looked great; however, that night when we returned, I noticed that some of the furniture was in bad shape, the moldings were chipped, the balcony was dirty, and we were missing a day bed! What the heck! I never complained about these things because I figured, \"Everything is not perfect, is it really affecting our trip?\" No. It wasn't. But, for paying close to $600 per night, I want my room to be pretty spectacular. Also, the first two nights, we didn't receive turn-down service. I even asked one of the maids if every room received turn-down service, and I got a clear \"Yes.\" Whatever, just another thing to tick me off. The bathrooms were always clean, and the shower was typical... low pressure. Overall, the room was nice. The Building: Ah, Boca Chica. My favorite! Well, used to be... It still is, but I noticed a couple things wrong this trip. For one, there was always a sign in the middle of the foyer that said, \"Watch your step. Wet floor.\" even when it wasn't raining. Also, there were a few instances were there would be a bottle of water, or plate, or something on one of the tables in the little lobby that would rot there overnight. The worst thing though was the dirty carpets. Almost every night, there was a straw wrapper, clothing tag, napkin, or other form of small garbage on the carpet! Now, on the second day, there was a maid vacuuming each floor, but it should be done everyday! Restaurants: We either dined at on this vacation or have dined at the following restaurants: 1900 Park Fare, The Grand Floridian Cafe, Gasparilla Grill and Games, and Narcoossee's. 1900 Park Fare is a silly buffet style breakfast or dinner with characters. The Grand Floridian Cafe is good for breakfast, okay for lunch, and bad for dinner. Gasparilla's is a quick service place. In my opinion, it's the best quick service on property. And then we come to Narcoossee's... oh, I just love it there! They have excellent fish and meat selections, and it overlooks the Magic Kingdom! It's divine! Shopping: There is a Basin White store (great for little gifts for people back home, or even yourself...), Summer Lace, which is an upscale store for women, Commodore Porter's, which is an upscale store for men, M. Mouse Mercantile, which is the typical \"Disneyana\" store, and Sandy Cove, which has sundries. All the stores are nice, and I always like going in them. Spa: The spa was excellent! I had a 50-minute massage along with my son. The Band: The band is perhaps the main reasons that non-Guests of the Grand Floridian come to visit. They are excellent, and they play every night! Overall: The Grand Floridian is still the best, but those problems definitely need to be fixed. I really think Disney is suffering from the economy, and it is starting to show. It would be nice if they could get back on their feet and preserve one of my favorite places in the world for years to come.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo", "Title": "\u201cWedding at The Grand\u201d", "Author": "amyn1438", "ReviewID": "UR114965525", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights for our wedding which was at the wedding pavilion located on property. There were both pros and cons to this resort. Pros: Decor, grounds, atmosphere, pools, dinning, views. Cons: Service, rooms. We arrived and were taken to check-in, which was a nightmare. I had done online check in, but the other guests in my party had not, and it took forever (like 40 minutes), and the man who checked us in was rude. Myself and my husband got to our room and it was horrible. We figured we would have gotten an upgrade since we were getting married here, but instead were given what had to be one of the worst rooms on property. It was on the ground floor with a patio right out over the noisy pool. Unfortunately, because of the fact we booked through our wedding room block, we could not even pay for an upgrade, and we also had to switch rooms three times, including the day of the wedding. These are related to problems withing the Disney Wedding system, not so much the Grand's fault, but the staff was not very helpful. We did get moved to a different room in the same building, which was slightly better but still not great. Our second room was on the concierge floor in the main building with an AMAZING view of the castle. If I were to stay again, I would stay on this floor. Although it was much more expensive, IMO if I'm already spending that much to stay here, I would splurge for the better room. Our third room was again just ok. We loved both pools at the resort, the one with the waterslide on the beach was nice during the day, and we liked the other pool for night swimming as hardly anyone was in it at night. The beach is very nice, the lobby beautiful. We diner at the GF Cafe and Citricos, and enjoyed both very much. I would love to stay here again, it is definitely a beautiful resort, however, I do think it is overpriced.

If you work your agenda right, you could limit the outside meals and have breakfast, snacks and occassional lunch/dinners it really is cost efficient. The only complaint I have on the trip is if you stay for a week or more there are few places to wash/dry clothes - literally one washer/dryer for two full buildings. While we are positive on GF over all others we have stayed at, you really need to consider the cost versus off property accommodations. Other than the \"park experience\" and convenience of monorails, unless you have small children (< 5 years), I beleive you get way better value outside the park and a lot more room/comfort and extras. We still lean towards staying inside, but as the kids get older we find less reason to pay such a premium for hotels that would be considered good (not great) relative to off site accommodations.

I didn't notice anything looking shabby or worn. Our rooms were fabulous and very clean and comfortable. We had a beautiful view of the bay, beach and the pool. Each staff member I met was very nice and accommodating. We have small children (ages 2 and 4) and many staff members went out of their way to talk to them and help with whatever we needed. The club level access was the icing on the cake. At any time, we could go get a drink or yummy snack and they set out a nice assortment at breakfast, as well as happy hour and appetizers.

There are not many amenities and poor lighting for make-up, no counter space, etc. I've been in much better digs than this. There's great potential here but this facility needs a facelift.

A few minor snafus: Upon check-in, I did request a microwave and didn't receive one. I called to inquire about this the next day,and it was promptly delivered. Our shower didn't drain very well, either. Those are the only real minor complaints that I could see, and to me these were not really that big of a deal. It certainly didn't affect our trip in any way. Unfortunately since we were there for such a short stay we didn't get a chance to dine at Narcoossee's, 1900 Park Fare or Victoria & Albert's. We did have dinner one night at The Grand Floridian Cafe, and it was average. Not a horrible meal, but nothing spectacular either. We did enjoy their sampler platter for dessert. It had a chocolate Mickey on it, which was a cute surprise, My son thought that was neat! Overall, I loved this resort and would definitely return in a heartbeat. Probably the only huge drawback to this resort is the price. I think it's a little too expensive, but it's right next door to the Magic Kingdom, and you know what they say.....location, location, location!!", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire Dales National Park, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect family holiday!\u201d", "Author": "Cusick", "ReviewID": "UR111992130", "Content": "Our second trip to Disney but first staying on resort.

It has a paino (which we were told Elton John has played) and Princess Di stayed in during her visit to Magic Kingdom. It was lovely. It has a view of the castle, and we were able to watch the fireworks from our balcony at night! There are flatscreen tvs throughout and 5 balconies! I think I enjoyed staying in our room more than going to the parks! I have to say we were treated just as well as when we have stayed in other catergory rooms at the Grand Floridian.

The Grand Floridian will be the ONLY place I stay when visiting Disney. This was my 3rd visit. It is a visually stunning property, the rooms are light, airy & clean and the location on the monorail is so convenient.. They just need to \"connect the dots\" a little better when it comes to providing truly Outstanding Service the first time. My examples of this follow. We stayed in Sugar Loaf, the outer concierge building. We arrived early and were greeting by Nadia who took us to a changing room, gave us our keys/park passes and explained we would receive a text when our room was ready (I love that). I asked if they were able to honor my request to face the pool and she said \"Yes, you are facing the pool.\" We spent the day at the parks and received a text message a few hours later with our room number. Our luggage was waiting for us in the room thanks the to Magical Express Service (love that!) but I was really disappointed in the room location. They gave us 6328, the last room at the end of the hall, and it had a view of two large trees facing the very end of the courtyard where the pool was, but it was not a pool view. As a matter of fact, I really couldn't see anything but tree branches. Also, the room was smaller and had a dormer ceiling and a smaller, enclosed balcony. I called the front desk to see if it was possible to move (and let me say the I DO understand a request is a request, as I work for a hotel here in PA) and I was told there was nothing available poolside but I could get a marina view. I hate the marina view because of the noise from the boats. They said they would call me back in 5 minutes. After 10 minutes I called and spoke with someone else who said THEY would help me and call back in 5 minutes, but 5 minutes later the original cast member (Chris) called me and said the marina view would not be ready for a few hours. I again pressed for a pool view and after several minutes was told I could get one the NEXT day - voila! Problem solved! I told him I would take it. Just wish that was offered initially - when we did get our new room my son actually said \"Wow, this is perfect\" - it was smack in the middle of the building with a perfect pool view. Room 6216. Full balcony, sleeper sofa, larger room, perfect pool view. Satisfied customer. Just took some persistence on my part. Minor issues: The monorail was down our 2nd day and we were told we could take a bus to Epcot. SO we went to the room to change and hang out for a few hours and when we came back down we asked if they were working. The cast members in the lobby said not yet. So when we got to the bus stop the driver said they WERE working and had been for over an hour. Bad communication. The movies on the beach were changed to movies by the pool which was kind of a bummer because I like the marshmallows by the campfire - but they had a huge event tent set up on the beach so that wasn't available. It was nice - but the Cast Member did a \"trivia\" Q&A before the movie - we had not yet seen 'Tangled' and it pretty much gave away the whole movie. Maybe they should do that AFTER the movie...? Especially if it is fairly new...? I received a package from work and when I called to retrieve it I was told there was a $3.00 \"handling fee\" - huh? For GETTING a package I didn't expect? I asked what that was for and he kept saying \"handling fee\" and I said I didn't think it was right to charge me for getting a package (it was a gift from my coworkers!) and he said \" I will waive it this time but normally we charge.\" As a hotel manager I NEVER surprise my Guests with hidden fees and I just thought this was shady. I am staying the the premier resort at Disney! Don't charge Guests for packages please! We slept in one day until 1130 and arrived at the Grand Floridian Cafe at noon. I asked if I could still get breakfast and was told \"No I'm sorry it's lunch.\" I asked politely if there was any way to just get some eggs or something and Loren said \"No we normally have a limited menu until noon but we can only do lunch.\" I said \"Are you sure?\" (because I just didn't believe it) and she got the manager Lindsay - a smiling woman who accommodated me right away and allowed me to order off of the limited menu. On my way out I told Loren to never tell a Guest no until she was sure and her response was \"I hope you come to see us again.\" It was kind of not-polished service and they would have lost my $53 sale if I hadn't persisted. My son was getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. I had seen some Off in the gift shop but when I went to get it, it was gone. SO I asked the concierge at Sugar Loaf if he knew where I could get some. He called over to the Polynesian, they said they had it, and he asked them to hold it for me. Well, it was 820 pm and I wanted to catch the 9pm pool movie, so I waited for the boat to the Poly, ran up the steps and no one at their gift shop knew what I was talking about - as a matter of fact, they said they sold the last can last night. I told them my concierge had just talked to someone and they spent 5 minutes trying to figure our who that was to place the blame. I really didn't care and they were not concerned about fixing my problem so I left, and by the time I got back I was in tears from frustration and spoke to my concierge Kent who was very upset he was misinformed. He then came out to me while I was at the movies and said the manager was going to get me a can of bug spray for all the trouble and have it delivered to my room. Now wow, that is outstanding service, right? After the movie I got a knock on the door with two cans of bug spray. Although I had an initial problem I was glad they made it right. It's a shame they don't have better communication between resorts. When I got my bill at checkout there was a \"Paid Out\" amount of $10.45 that I didn't recognize. When I called the front desk and questioned the charge, they said it said \"Guest requested bug spray.\" Oh no they did not! I told her I did not realize I would be charged for that and explained the situation and then they talked to Chris who said it would be taken off. Which was fine, and it fixed the problem - but again, they need to have the foresight to provide the \"extra service\" at the first opportunity. OK so perhaps this review sounded negative, but I am sure you can identify the \"service opportunities\" here. All in all, my stay was great, and I am coming back again in November, because I just love this place and how it makes me feel. It's early in the season and I hope they can tighten and polish their service a bit, it would truly make this the shining example of hospitality that Disney is known for. The bell staff is phenomenal and never took more than 5 minutes to get to the room. The turn-down service at night is a nice touch and the snacks throughout the day in the concierge building are an added plus. There are also movie rentals available for the DVD's in the room - they have a nice selection of 100's of Disney titles. I did visit the spa which was the best part of my trip. The waiting area got a bit crowded but it was FANTASTIC and I had the best massage of my life (note\" the essential oils they let you smell are a $15 upgrade) I saw a sign at their desk noting them as one of the top 25 spas in the U.S. Well deserved. Their pool is huge and never seems crowded, and I love the quick service meals at Gasparilla's. The Basin White gift shop is AWESOME and I love the smell of the place, there are fresh flowers everywhere, and I have never had trouble with housekeeping.

Obviously we insisted on another room and one was quickly organised however in hindsight now the fact that we touched and were subjected to the room may of also heightened our exposure to the Virus.

This is were we both stayed for the next four hours with only a fleeting glance over my shoulder every so often to ensure my Son was doing as well as he could.

To hear he little voice crying in between the sounds of his vomiting added another unwanted dimension to the \"place were dreams come true'.

We spent the rest of the day being Ambulanced to the hospital were drips fluids and medications was administered. After contacting the Disney crew the following day I was met with surprise and amazement that I and my young son had been ill. I reflect on Watergate and the then denials by president Nixon well Disney has nothing on him. Front desk through to supervisors did little apart from apologize for my situation, they denied their had been any issues with the property, nor did they acknowledge that on check in I had been led into a room infested and cleaned with a lingering smell and aroma of Vomit. They offered to refund my unused meal vouchers and the unused park vouchers, after some debate but fell far short of offering any type of service recovery in any way or form. The fact I reside in New Zealand and the subsequent cost to get to the US one woul;d of hoped that the Disney machine may of at least offered some degree of park access and or accommodation to be used at some time int he future.

As instructed, I asked the front desk clerk the night before check-out. We were told we could check-out at 1:30 with no additional fee, but any time after that would incure a $195 charge. We checked out the next day at 1:25PM. Thankfully I saved my statement, which showed a ZERO balance, and time-stamped at 1:25 PM. I just happened to look at my credit card statement a week later, and saw a charge of $195 from Walt Disney Resorts. I called and they told me I'd been charged for a late check-out. They removed the charge after I disputed it. The communication from Disney regarding my reservation was excellent, with the exception of this fee. I feel they make the late check-out charge and hope that guests don't notice it on the credit card bill. The hotel is lovely but much smaller than the photos lead you to believe. There is not much to do here. The bar above the lobby is nice, they serve great wine. They need to have better coffee available for this level of hotel.

That may be true, but Disney's attention clearly is elsewhere these days. The rooms were decently appointed and the staff was generally friendly, but that's the bare minimum I'd expect for several hundred dollars per night. While we were at the GF we had a day of really severe storms, with hail, high winds and tornadoes in the area. At 7 am I called to the main building to ask the concierge what activities they could suggest, on or off Disney property, to keep my five-year-old busy for the day. I was told the concierge could only help me in person, and was advised to walk to the main building. I pointed out that there was thunder and lightning outside in addition to sideways rain. My plea did not move the front desk clerk to offer any alternatives. When I did make it to the main building, I asked if the hotel had any activities planned for the day. The GF has lots of games by the pools on most days, and I was hoping they were planning to move the games inside to help occupy the kids. Nope. Maybe a story hour in a lobby nook? Nope. How 'bout a screening of a Disney film? Nowhere to do it, they said. (They have two restaurants that operate for dinner only; I imagine they could push some tables aside and set up a screen for kids to watch while sitting on the floor.) What about a scavenger hunt through the main building and huge lobby? No, nothing there either. They did offer to open the Mouseketeer Club (babysitting room) so kids could do crafts and play video games. That was a nice option, but the room itself is extremely small and parents needed to stay with the kids, so the club could accommodate only a handful of kids and their parents at one time. I was profoundly disappointed not only by the staff's lack of Plan B options for severe weather days, but by their whole not-my-problem attitude. GF does bill itself as a \"resort,\" not just a hotel, after all. Furthermore, their in-room TV options are negligible. No pay-per-view channels, no Disney movies running on a loop, nothing like that. Finally, I did a socks-and-underwear load of laundry in the coin-operated machines in our building. The washer was functional, but two dollars and 45 minutes after I put them in the dryer, my clothes weren't even close to dry. I had to take them back to my room and hang them all over the place. Some of them still weren't dry the next morning. I called a housekeeping supervisor to tell him the dryer was broken. He apologized and said he would call \"engineering.\" I suggested that perhaps it was time to spring for a new dryer, and he laughed as if there was *no way* the hotel would do that. Clearly, I wasn't the first guest to report a problem with the laundry facilities. If you want WiFi, be prepared to pay for it. And not just once, either - if you want web access in your room and in the lobby, you have to pay two separate fees. Disney is a corporation, and that feel has really spread through all of Disney World. They don't even make a pretense anymore about trying to make you happy. They gouge guests for every last cent, and that overall attitude leaves an unpleasant taste when you've spent thousands of dollars for a vacation.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississippi", "Title": "\u201cWhere once upon a time happens once upon a day.\u201d", "Author": "mouseketeer11", "ReviewID": "UR102488187", "Content": "After reading some of the comments on here I felt I needed to give people an accurate description of this beautiful hotel that makes you feel like you've stepped back in time to a more peaceful, kinder world. We've been staying at the Grand Floridian every year for the past 11 years, and I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. We've gotten so spoiled that in 2007 we went back for a second trip during the Christmas season and couldn't get reservations at the GF so we ended up staying at the Polynesian. The difference in service between these two resorts was so great that we don't make reservations if we can't get in at the GF. Staying at a Magic Kingdom resort has so many advantages over staying outside the parks. The early and late hours afforded to resort guests is just one. I can't express to anyone who hasn't stayed at the GF how wonderful it is to have a relaxing evening at the resort sitting out on the lawn in view of Magic Kingdom and Cinderella's castle across the water or watching fireworks at night over the castle from your balcony or the resort grounds. During the summer you can even watch movies on the beach at night. The resort is truly a vacation in itself. The spa at the resort is incredible with massages, exercise room and hot tub and sauna. We have always found the staff incredibly helpful. That's not to say that everything at Disneyworld runs smoothly 24/7. ( if you've found a place that does, let me know) I will say that anytime we have ever run into any problems, the GF staff has been quick to do whatever it took to fix the problem. I've read on here that some people think the rooms are dated...ummm, this hotel has a Victorian theme, they're SUPPOSED to be dated! The rooms are always clean! The food choices at this hotel are incredible too. We've eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the world, and I can honestly tell you that Narcoosies ranks #2 on our list, second only to a restaurant in Paris. If you're looking for a once in a lifetime experience, the food and atmosphere at Victoria and Alberts should be on your list, and don't forget Gasparillo's. Now for one of the main reasons I'm writing this review. I read an earlier one from someone from Ohio who evidently feels more comfortable outside the parks. DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!! Disney makes it easy for you by providing all the information they can to make your stay as enjoyable and trouble free as possible. Unfortunately you will not be the only person staying at the parks and they honestly do try to make EVERYONE happy! If you intend to dine at Disneyworld, check out their food choices. They state very clearly which restaurants you may need a reservation get into, and I'm telling you from experience, if you want to SIT down and eat, it's most of them. Also, if having a cocktail or any other alcoholic beverage in the middle of the day is what you're looking for, maybe a family theme park isn't your thing. I've stayed at more expensive hotels in the country, including The Plaza in New York and the GF is my favorite. I'll end this by stating that no matter where I've been, I have never found a place where the attention to detail and customer service comes close to the level of that at the Grand Floridian or Disneyworld in general. I hope this helps anyone who is thinking of staying there.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cMagical Stay at the Grand Floridian\u201d", "Author": "Viking78", "ReviewID": "UR102053387", "Content": "Before I talk about my six night stay at the Grand Floridian, I want to stress that if you are a traveler that is used to the pampering at the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Westin, you will find the Grand Floridian disappointing because your expectations not only will not be met, but one cannot fairly compare those three hotels with the Grand Floridian. The Grand Floridian is Disney's flagship hotel, but you are paying for the convenience of the transportation to Magic Kingdom Park and EPCOT, and seclusion from most of the Walt Disney World Resort. There are a variety of amenities offered at the Grand Floridian (television channels are limited, but you are not going to Disney World to watch TV 24/7 either), but I strongly suggest being realistic of what the Grand Floridian can provide for you. I booked my room through a package with AAA/Walt Disney Travel Company. I would strongly recommend booking your room this way than trying to do everything ala carte. You save some money in the long run, and this is the only way you can make some room requests. Although my initial room request was not initially granted (i.e., No dormer room), my family and I subtlely asked whether there was another room avaiable. After the front desk called the necessary people, we were placed in Boca Chica on the second floor, which provided an excellent view of the Contemporary and Space Mountain. There were no traces of bed bugs. Housekeeping changed the bed linens every day, and other than the usual wear and tear that you see in the hotels rooms, our room itself was very clean. The staff at the Grand Floridian was very friendly to my family and me; often going out of their way to provide insights to any questions that we might have had. After reading some negative postings, the only advice I feel I can fairly make is to encourage you to do your homework and work with a travel agent that you can trust. I would suggest pricing out your own package first on the Disney World website, and presenting your findings to a travel agent to see if you are getting the best deal. This was the approach I took, and I was very pleased with the end result. We ate at Gasparilla Grill most mornings; 1900 Park Fare for the Character Dinner on our final night and Grand Floridian Cafe on our final morning for breakfast. The food was very good. Be prepared for high food prices across the Walt Disney World resort. Disney's Dining Plan might be a worthwhile option, or there are a couple grocery stores in the area if you want to plan ahead that way. The only minor issue was the availability of the Monorail...especially to EPCOT. The monorail itself was efficient, but the waits were longer than usual. Bus service can be hit and miss, which depends on the timing on the day. In both cases, patience and flexibility are good attributes to have. I would return to the Grand Floridian in a minute.

Even BETTER they actually said 'no charging privileges' on the front of the card!!! and this after the 'concierge' had just spent at LEAST 20 minutes of our precious vacation time explaining all about the charging....so i walked back to our 'concierge' desk and showed them the keys (meanwhile the bartender is holding our drinks and food hostage behind the bar in case we can't pay for them) and they 'fix' the keys with no apology (this is a different 'concierge' by the way) just the explanation that they said no charging allowed on them. OK so walk the whole way back to the pool bar, give the bartender the NEW key and now the computer says 'over limit' and we are still NOT allowed to charge our drinks and food. While the bartender made a feigned attempt to pick up the phone and 'call' SOMEONE - after about 2 seconds he gave me the cards back and asked me to walk myself back to the 'concierge' desk and fix the problem myself. SOO back I went - by now the husband and kids are super unhappy (and not loving the MAGICAL experience) I am met by YET another 'concierge' who assures me she will get to the bottom of this.

We were relegated to the room service in our 300 sq ft room which was horrendous. I have had better food on airplanes in coach. And the cost of the room service?? OVER $200! I think disney is really missing the mark here. It is 2011! they need to realize that people with kids want and need to be flexible AND they want and need to have nice food and dining experience. This is not rocket science! Please! what about seating at the bar?? What about having AT LEAST one restaurant that doesn't close in the middle of the day - that - DARE I SAY it - is open from maybe 8 am to 10 pm every day? where you can have a server and a cocktail and not have to sit with your plastic tray full of crappy food on your lap outside on a park bench? this IS vacation by the way!

Overall, we felt it was disappointing for the price tag, and the poor experience left a bad taste in our mouth. It was our first visit to Disneyworld. First, the pluses: 1. the convenience of having the monorail access which takes you straight to the magic kingdom was wonderful. That is a huge convenience as you don't have to take the parking shuttle to the parking lot, and then walk to your car and then drive home at 11.30 pm after the fireworks and show, when you are totally exhausted. 2. The resort is very clean, no musty smells, very very hygienic. 3. Some of the staff is truly outstanding: Scott and Kari at the Front Desk; Ilina (or Ilia) in the Casparillo; Sarah, our server at the GF cafe; Maggie at the Concierge desk; to name a few. The Bellhop staff is all great, as are those who work Housekeeping, who made witty towel sculptures and cleaned meticulously. 4. The heated 24 hr pool, and the second zero-entry pool with a small beach attached was a big hit with the kids. The property is well manicured and beautiful. The food options are very limited at this property to meat-oriented American fare, and we ended up ordering in from local restaurants after two days. The minuses: at $600 a night (for a 300 sq ft room approx), one expects a more comfortable and luxurious in-room experience, at least comparable to the Ritz Carlton or even Westin. However, the walls at the property are very thin, and we were woken up late at night as well as early hours with the noise of people above and next door who were flushing, showering, etc.!! When we complained, the staff member Tatiana was very rude and unhelpful. She asked us to pack up our luggage and put it in storage at 11 am, and told us that we could check into a different room \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whenever it became available: it could be 3 pm or 4 pm or later.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Travelling with a small child, I did not appreciate the suggestion that we should hang out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153homeless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the lobby for 5 hours, when we are paying $600 per night!

Turns out, although we had purchased it on day 1 there, the cashier then had neglected to cut off some plastic bit on it which they are supposed to on sale; we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this, so when we went for breakfast on day 3, the cashier we were about to pay asked us, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You already paid for this?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shocked, I said yes, you can look it up in your record, because we had paid with our room credit card. Implying that we might be lying, the cashier working behind her, and serving other customers, shouted out loudly to us, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you sure you paid for this? When you buy this?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As other customers stared at us, we were both shocked at this implication that a guest who is paying these exorbitant room rates would steal a $2 mug, and the complete disregard, lack of courtesy and disrespect accorded us in this interaction. At the time, we were too stunned to take up the issue immediately with the manager, as we should have done, about this nasty treatment. Also their check-in is 3 pm, and although we arrived at around 11.30 am, no effort was made to get us into the room earlier; we waited till 3 pm in the lobby! I did not appreciate being forced to check out at 11 instead of the customary 12 noon. Overall, the nasty service experiences overshadowed those when staff was excellent. I did not feel valued and respected as a guest at this property, and would not return, or recommend it: at $600 per night, I think I'd get a more high-end, spacious and luxurious experience elsewhere, with consistently top-notch, HELPFUL service and minus the cross-questioning about whether you might have stolen a $2 mug.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service..OK rooms\u201d", "Author": "mtlfamily4", "ReviewID": "UR101519706", "Content": "Stayed at the Grand Floridian for the 1st time for 4 nights...rooms were OK, very CLEAN but a little dated...STAFF WAS AMAZING in the concierge wing of the hotel, helped us with various issues not related to our time at disney and always with a smile and a solution!

We paid over $9800 for four rooms for five nights. It took years to save for this vacation. At the time of the reservation and then again three days prior to arrival I requested at least two rooms be adjoining (traveling with a 3 year old and an 18 month old) and for all four rooms to be on the same floor. When I arrived it took over 2 hours to get checked in. Our four rooms were not anywhere near each other and I assume that is what took so long to get checked in. I didnt start getting upset until the second hour. I had 2 small children who were running around and two upset senior citizens that couldnt understand what was taking so long at this nice fancy resort hotel that cost so much money. The supervisors who were trying to get our rooms together never made any eye contact with me, the front desk clerk kept going in the back for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Finally I did get a manager (Erin) who actually made eye contact and was straight with me telling me our rooms were not going to be together or even on the same floors. At this point I just wanted our rooms. She did offer us the opportunity to move two of the rooms in two days (but still no adjoining). We ended up with all rooms in same building, one room on 1st, one room on 4th and two rooms on 5th (not beside each other either) At least we had rooms but it got our vacation off to a terrible beginning. It was very inconvenient not having a room next to the room with the small children. We picked the most expensive hotel at Disney thinking we would get what we paid for. That was not the case and a very expensive lesson. The hotel was beautiful and rooms were average and clean. But the reservation/front desk department caused us so much frustation and the experience was very stressful for all of us. Erin did buy us dinner the first night for the inconvenience and I did appreciate that but would have much rather had our rooms together as I requested several times before arrival.

After reading many reviews on this site, I was a bit skeptical thinking, \"will this hotel live up to the hype?, is it worth the extra money compared to the other Deluxe resorts?\" Well the answer is a BIG YES!!! I can only think that some of the poor reviews left by others are people who are comparing this resort to other big high-end hotels like the Four Seasons etc, remember, this is Disney, so if you want the best in service and amenities, not to mention location, don't stay anywhere else, and don't second guess yourself, this is where you want to be. We stayed in a concierge room in the Sugar Loaf building which was great. We had a room on the ground floor just steps away from the concierge lounge. At first I was thinking this might be noisy, but to my surprise, it was extremely convenient being able to step just outside our door to get coffee early morning or late night snacks. They actually have big heavy doors that they keep closed early in the morning & later in the evening, so if you have young kids, opt for the main floor, just outside of the lounge. Our room was well maintained by housekeeping, lots of room for a family of 4, we had 2 queen beds & our youngest son loved having the day bed to himself. Concierge was always available, and definitely helpful. We stayed at Bay Lake Tower last year and I thought I would miss having the separate bedroom, kitchen facilities etc, but the Grand Floridian delivered and I didn't miss anything.

It isn't! CHECK-IN We arrived via a private Disney transport from Port Canaveral [we had just been on a Disney Cruise]. Arrival was pleasant enough. Our luggage was handled immediately and we were escorted to the reception. Check-in was quick and handled efficiently by personable reception staff. The lobby was quite impressive, large, light and airy. Certainly throughout our stay, it was a welcome relief to walk through the lobby doors after a long day at the parks! ROOMS The hotel is very large and comprises the main block which includes the main entrance and restaurants and separate accommodation blocks lining the lake and forming enclosed courtyards. It creates quite a successful, enclosed and private atmosphere for hotel guests. We were located in Sago Cay, a separate block. This comprises a central entrance that leads into an small, unmanned, multi-height lobby, dressed with comfy seating and fresh flower displays. It follows a similar interior design to the main lobby, but on a much smaller scale. The flooring and elevators are of inferior quality. Our room was located on the third floor. All rooms on all floors are either off the lobby area or to the wings, left and right of the lobby. The actual room was large, accommodating 2 queen beds, a desk, cupboards and dresser with built-in flat panel TV. To the end of the room was a 3 seat sofa and lounge chair and stool to the side. Sliding patio doors opened up onto a balcony with a pleasant view of a courtyard and lake. The balcony and floor was a bit grimy. Something had been spilt but not cleaned. To the immediate left of the entrance was an opening that led to a carpeted area with a marble vanity unit with twin wash basins. Off this area lies the bathroom, housing the bath with wall shower attachment and WC. The decor was in a faux victorian style, nothing too luxurious, but perfectly acceptable. However, the bathroom was a different matter. Here, it was obvious that things needed upgrading. It just looked dated. The actual bath and fittings were old. The cheap marble square tiles, whilst perhaps chic at the time, just looks cheap. They only covered the bath area, with wall paper covering the rest of the room. The bath had a cheap, plastic, utilitarian hand rail fixed to wall - think of a disabled WC grab rail!. The shower fittings also did not work too well - not enough pressure. The bathroom phone was also in a 1970's/80's style - quite horrible and the wall paper was trimmed badly around this fitting. Note, the drying line was dirty! Just to recap, the bedroom area was fine and very clean. The washbasin area was ok, but the bathroom left a lot to b e desired. SERVICES The courtyard pool and jacuzzi was heated and open 24hours but unmanned. Towels were available freely. The second pool had a water slide and waterfall, was manned but had limited opening hours. Overall, very good to have the variety and choice. We dined at 1900 Park Fare - It was OK, a buffet with limited choice, but what do you expect at a Disney Park? Room service/turn down was bizarre and random. The people were friendly, but if we left the iron board out or the tv was left on during the day, we would come back in the evening to a clean room, but the board or tv still left out/on! SUMMARY People pay the premium on this hotel because of its unsurpassed access/transportation to the Magic Kingdom and bus tranport to other parks further away is very good aswell. It's convenient and quick. If you have high expectations based on other 5 star hotels, it would be advisable to knock off a star.

When we went our daughter was 22 months old and our nephew was 3.5 years old. I was a bit worried about some of the reviews I read that claimed it was not a place for small children but was happily surprised. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and we upgraded our rooms to Club Level which meant that we got access to the Sugarloaf Club. (this meant that we had a Lounge with beverages,Continental breakfast, midday snacks, afternoon tea, evening wine, cheese and hors d'oeuvres, late night cordials and desserts). This was PERFECT for everyone as we could just walk downstairs and eat breakfast (sometimes kids still in their PJs). They had a flat screen tv playing cartoons and little tables and chairs espically for them. It was also nice to just have a drink before dinner or pick up a snack on our way back to our rooms for nap time. ROOM - adequate space with nice ammenities. The crib is not full size but slightly larger and nicer than a pack n play. Depending on where your room is you will hear/see the fireworks at the MK and can also see the electric water parade. Everything in the room was clean and had no complaints. We ordered room service for breakfast on two days when the kids wanted pancakes and french toast. Food was and service were both above average. RESTAURANTS - Some of the best lunches we had during our stay were from Gasparilla Grill. They had several food options for children (burgers, pizza, nuggets, etc) and above average options for adults (club sandwiches/paninis, salads, etc.). Their other meal items looked good as well and it was a great place to stop and pick up a snack. We also had dinner one night at the GF Cafe. We were afraid it was not going to be kid friendly but it really was. The wait staff was very attentive and were really nice to the kids. Most of the adults at the table got the signature burger which was a Angus Chuck Burger, Lobster, Asparagus, and Horseradish-Chive Hollandaise - very tasty and one had the steak which was also cooked well. We did not try the other restaurants as we had booked most of our dinners out in the parks. (see restaurant review). POOLS/RECREATION - the pools were both very nice and we were happy that they were heated as it was a bit chilly. We really liked the pool with the slide because it had a walk in entry so the kids felt like they had more freedom to play without having to be held all the time. They have entertainment by this pool as well and the kids loved the music and games. The \"beach\" was clean and the sand was soft but it was still a lake and I found the water to be a bit gross. However, the kids did enjoy playing in the sand. Both kids were too young to participate in most of the activities/clubs but they still had a blast just running around the property and playing in the grass. I was a bit concerned because this resort does not have a playground but we did fine without one. LOCATION - can't beat it! Was so WONDERFUL to be on the monorail line with children in strollers!!! I really think it made the stay so much more stressfree. We took the buses to Animal Kingdom, DHS and to downtown disney and was so much more of a hassle with the strollers and diaperbag. The kids also really loved the mono. Hope this review helps! Just don't dismiss this resort if you have small children.

Upon checking in my room was not ready, and after waiting 2+ hours I was still unable to get into my room. At around 5PM I made it into my room. The room was quite nice and I had a great view of the Magic Kingdom from my balcony. I was also staying in the main building, club level and got some really good treatment there too. Upon checking out my travel documents, provided by Disney travel, I noticed that the dates were wrong on all the docs, including some of the tours and special events which I paid extra for. I immediately went to my concierge on the club level and pointed out the mistakes. Vonnie, her name was, happened to be very helpful. She contacted the ravel company and was told it would take 2+ days to get the corrected docs over to the hotel which was unacceptable. Eventually she got the situation handled. The following day when I returned to my room after a meeting I found a bag with all kinds of candy and other goodies waiting for me(pixidusting is what they called it). The room like I said was very nice, and yes, did have a coffee maker. I was still expecting a little more.. I think for the money spent I should have gotten more. This is a very pricey hotel, but kind of over the top at some points and at others lacking in some areas. Another issue I had was that at the end of the day I had the privacy notice on my door and yet the housekeeping staff and evening turndown service still knocked on the door. The convenience of having the monorail right outside the lobby was a nice advantage....

Upon arrival the valet was efficient and friendly, check-in was a breeze, and navigating the property was not hard at all. Then came the room, upon first glance everything looked pretty clean but as I would soon find out this was not the case. When I went to pickup the phone to order room service there was a sticky \"sap like\" substance all over the phone. While I was ordering my wife pulled out the desk chair to find several large \"dark colored\" stains on the cushion. I thought to myself, maybe these two small items were overlooked during housekeeping service but at further inspection here is what was found: several large stains on the bench at the end of the bed, mold covering the grout between the shower tiles, small \"food like\" pieces littering the floor between the TV stand and the foot of the bed and the floor was so dirty that when I took a look at the bottom of my socks they had turned black. As for maintenance the room looked extremely dated compared to other similar brands that I have stayed at in the area (Ritz Carlton, Peabody......etc). In the closet the shelving was in desperate need of painting (chipping and where the shelving actually attaches to the wall the holes were cut too big so you can see the joists), wallpaper coming apart at the seams, sliding glass door lock not working, broken tile on the patio (also a safety hazard), paint on many of the hardware and light fixtures and the lamps above the headboard were falling sideways. On a smaller note, movie rental is not offered through the TV, I assumed that this was a standard in most luxury hotels these days. Needless to say after encountering these issues, myself and my wife decided it would be best to checkout to avoid further stress. Then came the overnight front desk staff. I checked out around 12:30am \"Laura D\" at the front desk was excellent, she showed genuine care and empathy towards my issues and tried to help me on all accounts. She was extremely proffesional and polite and showed the true \"magic\" that a Disney employee can posess. Unfortunatley also at the desk that night was an employee by the name of \"Leah\". Now I am not one to generally bash an employee for being rude as I think everyone can have a bad day, but to me \"Leah\" was astounding. It started when \"Laura D\" asked for \"Leah's\" help regarding my account as once again \"Laura D\" was trying to help me, and to my shock it appeared as \"Leah\" had no interest in helping at all. In fact, not only was she not interested but instead of walking what I would estimate as 10' - 15' to assist \"Laura\" she decided to yell across the front desk and told \"Laura\" to \"Hold on\", all while another family was at the desk as well. \"Leah\" then proceeded to tell me that she was not going to refund my night due to the fact that I was in the room past midnight. The funny thing is I never asked for any type of compensation in regards to my issues, not only did I not ask for compensation I actually told her that since my room and tax had not yet posted to the account I needed her to do so before I could check out, that way I was charged for the room. \"Leah\" then walked back to her podium where the phone rang and beleive it or not she actually answered the phone, and in exact words the greeting was \"wassup yo\" I couldn't beleive my ears, they don't even answer the phone like that at Holiday Inn. While I understand this may have been an internal call, the un-proffesionalism that \"Leah\" displayed was in no way, shape or form acceptable. In the end I would have \"Laura D\" working for me anyday but as for \"Leah\", the resort may want to consider some additional training or possibly relocation to a back-of-house position. So needless to say after my experience I will not be staying at the Grand Floridian again and in my opinion I would not recommend that anyone else do so either, at least until the hotel goes through a major refurbishment of there rooms and gets a bit more strict with there housekeeping staff.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fontana, California", "Title": "\u201cI am HOMESICK for the Grand Floridian!!!\u201d", "Author": "gretchensue", "ReviewID": "UR92604185", "Content": "ROOM 9341 in BOCA CHICA building, AMAZING 4th floor corner \"ON THE WATER ,\" view of CASTLE!!

A second complaint meant we changed rooms three times in a few hours with the promise of a \"great room\". This turned out to be the exact same room, on a higher floor - So basically a rubbish room with a better view. I can't begin to describe how horrible this hotel is. The decor, fixtures and fittings makes it feel as if you are staying at someone's grandmother's house and I was shocked to find that the hotel is only 20 years old. The lobby is extremely busy and the concierges rude and unhelpful, especially when asking about anything non Disney related. For instance, after tiring of the hot dogs and pizza available in Disney and craving a proper meal, I attempted to make a reservation at a restaurant in another off Disney hotel, only to be handed the phone by the concierge and told to do it myself.

You'll be just one stop away on the (sometimes very crowded) monorail. You can also take the monorail to Epcot, but that will involve a transfer and will add at least a half hour travel time each direction. Other areas such as the Animal Kingdom are reachable via the vast and confusing Disney transit system also adding lots of transit time, so just grab a cab instead if you can. Hopefully your stay here will start as ours did, by being greeted by a marvelous older gentleman. We saw him frequently, out directing the buses and greeting as many guests as he could. He led us into the vast lobby and got the attention of someone at front desk. They were kind enough to find us a room that was ready to check into, as we were early. The room was in the Sago Cay building, which I would recommend for those who want some peace and quiet. One end of the building, however, is close to a service road and the adjacent Convention Center and therefore noisier, so try to get a higher-numbered room. Our ground floor room (described as 'garden view') actually looked out over a bit of the lagoon. The monorail track was visible as well, but we did not hear it. It was great fun to sit in the room and watch the monorails whizzing past in both directions. The location was surprisingly peaceful. Rooms have 2 double beds with very comfortable mattresses. Our room looked a little cramped with 2 beds and a sofabed, but I can't imagine a family being comfortable in one. The decor is somewhat fussy for my taste but it works well with the architecture of the hotel. There is also a mini fridge which is very convenient, though ours was a bit noisy. The bathroom has 2 open vanities and not one shelf or drawer to put things away. Closet space was fine for 2 but again would be tight for any more. We could hear noise from the hallways, which one would expect. Mornings when the park opens early were quite active, but who can't remember the excitement of their first Disney trip? We had an ongoing issue with hot water in our room. Every time we wanted a shower, we'd have to turn on both taps as well as the bath tub, and run them, sometimes for 20 minutes, before the water warmed up. This was most inconvenient when trying to stick to a schedule, as we'd waste lots of time waiting for hot water. It's a shame to waste all the water as well. I finally complained and when we got back to the room later there were THREE plumbers. They assured me they fixed the problem, but as it turns out all they actually did was run the water long enough to make it hot. Management seems quite aware of the problem and one would think it was fixable. We ate at the hotel quite frequently. The GF Cafe is bright and sprawling, and the food is okay. Ditto Citrico's upstairs, it was okay but real fine dining it is not. We were unable to get into Narcosee's so cannot comment on the food. We also did not dine at Victoria and Alberts, supposedly the best and priciest of all Disney restaurants. Generally though we thought all Disney food contains alot of sulfites to keep it fresh, so be mindful if sulfites or preservatives bother you. The Spa isn't really what one would expect of a \"luxury\" hotel, but you might enjoy a massage or facial there, if you ever have time! There is a pool and a stretch of bright white sand, which no one was using during our visit (the temperature was close to 80 most days). I would recommend the GF to families of any size, especially those with seniors in their group, who will get a kick out of the nostalgic design. The hotel lobby is lovely.

After reading a lot of guide books and reviews, I chose the Grand Floridian. I have stayed in all different classes of hotels when traveling from budget to top of the line. For our first trip to Disney, my priority was convenience, service, and relaxation while getting the full Disney feel. I wanted to stay at a hotel on the monorail where transportation to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot was not a hassel and for that, the Grand Floridian did not disappoint. It was nice to have the option of taking a boat to the magic kingdom as well. Our standard room was not in the main hotel but in the Boca Chica building. It was a quiet, comfortable room, could have used better tv channels, ( I like to watch at night before I go to sleep), and nicer quality blankets for the money you're paying. We had a great view of the lagoon, boats, the Magic Kingdom, nightly fireworks and electrical parade. I am glad that I specifically asked for that view when I made the reservation because my son really enjoyed sitting on the balcony and watching the action first thing in the morning and before he went to sleep at night. Because we had just celebrated my son's fourth birthday a week before we arrived, the hotel delivered a white chocolate mickey mouse with a plate of cookies and a happy birthday message on the day we arrived. It was a lovely touch and it's things like that that make the Grand Floridian earn its' money. I liked having two sinks in the bathroom, the shower was nice, nice organic soap and shampoo. Plenty of towels, liked the turn-down service at night with the hotel chocolates on the pillow. If you're a picky person the room could be considered a touch dated but we were very comfortable for the time we were in it. Not having wifi was not an issue for us but I realize it could be for others. My only complaint staying in an outside building was that you had to walk to the main building for any type of drink or snack. Granted this was not a concierge building and it's not a hike to the main building, but I'm just putting it out there. (We were on the deluxe meal plan and I didn't think we'd take full advantage of a concierge building but if we weren't I would strongly consider it.) We used both pools, the main pool and the beach pool and thoroughly enjoyed them both. We ate at Citricos the first night we were there which was good, character breakfast at 1900 Park Fare (thought Chef Mickey's at the Contemporary was better) and regularly went to Gasparillas which is conveniently open 24 hours. (Being a New Yorker I have to say that all Disney ppoperties need to improve their bagels but I don't know if anyone else even notices or cares.) The lobby in the main building is very pretty and elegant for Disney. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It was nice to return to the Grand Floridian after a long day at the parks or a late dinner. It was quiet, and comfortable, and relaxing. Not sure if it's always like that or this was a particularly slow week. But from having read earlier reviews, it seems like that is the general vibe. The golf carts and construction didn't bother us. We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. For Disney, this is as high end as it gets and we had a truly magical vacation. If it doesn't break the bank, it's worth it. Having said that, if I went with a large group with a lot of kids or older kids, and the Magic Kingdom wasn't my main priority I may think about staying in the Boardwalk area which is by Epcot, at the Beach and Yacht Club, where there's a little more action and an awesome pool.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel Property Missing Expected Amenities\u201d", "Author": "Georgia L", "ReviewID": "UR87534356", "Content": "I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

I was told no several times at the quick service restaurant for simple things like chips instead of fries with my meal. Staff should not tell a guest no at a five start resort.

The Animal Kingdom Lodge is still our favorite because at least there you get to see the animals. All of the other hotels are just nice hotels.

We used Legacy Towncar and paid $250.00 for a stretch limo round trip. This also included a 20 minute stop at a grocery store for anything we wanted to pick up for our room/holiday. They were very good, on time and we didn't need to sit on a bus waiting for other people and the same for the ride back to the airport..

It was such a great way to end a busy day at the parks with an anytime warm swim.

Every level from the housekeepers to grounds keepers up to managers, bell staff and even the store employees. We did not run into one unpleasant staff person. We did arrange for the birthday package for our first night to be delivered to our room for our son. It included presents from 5 of the main Disney characters in huge boxes with amazing colored ribbons. If you are having a childs birthday at Disney this is a wonderful surprise. We walked up to the room and there was a big sash on the door, the room was decorated and then all the gifts. The cost is approx. $500.00 USD but what a fun time it was. The spa is very nice. It is a bit of a walk, but worth it when you get there. I had a spa pedicure for $65.00 and was expecting to pay much more. Very good value. If you are thinking about staying here, do not hesitate.

Nice idea and can see the logic why Disney have done it but confusing for guests and staff alike. We found there was no consistency in charging- particularly when using the grill restaurant, where from 1 day to the next you never knew what the charge would be. To make reservations was also very \"hit and miss\" - when you are staying for 14 days you haven't necessarily organised every single day . Big mistake as we found out - you need to as you won't get your preferred choice. Also be prepared to have to wait for your table even when booked.

I had been planning this for several months and was hoping for everything to be perfect and run according to plan. I had very high expectations having read reviews of the hotel and conducting research on the Walt Disney World website. However my experience was far from perfect and far from Magical. Upon opening the door to our room, we were at first very happy with everything. I had paid extra for the Magic Kingdom view and this is what I received. However after being in the room for about five minutes my girlfriend told me her shoes were sticking to the carpet. Upon closer inspection the entire carpet was sopping wet. It would seem the carpet had been shampooed but not dried afterwards. I could not believe such an oversight could have been allowed. I immediately phoned the front desk to make them aware of the situation and see how this could be resolved. After a lengthy call it was agreed we would be upgraded to a honeymoon suite and be given concierge access. I was guaranteed it would have the same view of the Magic Kingdom. With much excitement we went to the front desk to collect our new keys. Upon arrival at the room the first thing we did was to check the view. I was shocked to see that a tree was just in front of our room and virtually obscured all views of the Magic Kingdom. By his time we were over an hour late for our dinner reservation. Another call was made to the front desk to try and resolve the matter. However we found the members of staff increasingly difficult deal with over the phone so we left the room to continue the conversation with the front desk manager on duty that night. I was very frustrated at the way I was treated. My plans for the proposal by this time were completely ruined and I felt physically sick from the stress of the situation. I felt that the front desk manager was not sympathetic to our problems and really could not have cared less. She kept mentioning how I had paid such a low rate and how they had already upgraded us. She felt that was enough; however the fact was, I did not get the view I paid extra for. After much discussion it was agreed we would view another suite, this time with no Magic Kingdom view. We accepted the room, as by this time it was very late. Due to the great inconvenience caused to us, I requested some form of compensation. Treating us to dinner would have been sufficient; however we were advised that nothing like this was possible. After much bargaining we were offered complimentary park hopper tickets and water park tickets for the next day worth about $500. Having spent such a great deal of time planning this trip, for my plans to be destroyed due to the hotels incompetence just shocked me. I never would have expected this from Disney.

The GF is currently carrying out some repainting of the exterior - it is a wooden building, it needs to be done at some time, and though there was one day when the most convenient entrance to the main building was closed off, in general I thought that the handling of the work was done quite sympathetically. Last time we stayed we had a room in the main building. This time we had a 2 bed suite in the outer lodge - it was enormous. I have two very minor negatives - 1) the character dining has been switched to the Park Lane restaurant which did not have the same ambiance as the Floridian Cafe and felt a little too much like a production line and 2) the bar prices are extortionate compared both to other Disney locations and other 'expensive' Florida locations.

Finally, I called the manager and explained that because of this, we missed our dinner reservations at 6:30 in China in epcot. They kindly made some other reservations for us in France at 8:30. So we missed the fireworks, which was our favorite part of Epcot!!! The extended hours at Epcot was a joke, the rides were still 50 min. wait, don't even bother!

It totally fits the bill. We checked-in on July 29th. We were personally greeted in the Porte Cochere and brought the front desk where Georgia checked us in. She was still \"Earning her Ears,\" however she did a very good job and got us a ready room. We were in Room 8120 (Boca Chica, 1st floor.) I wasn't very happy about getting a 1st floor room, but I wasn't going to make her switch our room. The room itself was great! It was standard with two queen beds, day bed, desk, fridge, flat screen TV, separate vanities, and an okay shower. The room had a nice patio, however it was directly next to the front entrance of Boca Chica. Note: if you are staying here within the next month, know that they are doing major renovations to the exteriors of the buildings from 9-5pm. We had only two problems: one; the room was noisy due to the proximity to the entrance and elevators, and the fridge was loud; and two; the remote was awful. Other than that, it was perfect and very close to the pool. The first night we were there, a maid knocked on our door and introduced herself. She asked if we \"wouldn't mind\" if she turned down our beds between 7-9pm. We, of course, said sure! The turndown service was a nice touch (and free.) The beds were turned back, you were given high quality Belgian chocolate, and your TV was playing classical music similar to what you hear in the lobby every night. Oh yeah, that's another thing; a band or amazing piano player are performing in the lobby every night from 5-10pm. The pools were amazing as well. The Courtyard Pool, which was 10 steps from our building, was nice because it was open 24 hours and it was somewhat quiet. The Beach Pool was the themed pool. It was a little small, it was noisy, and crowded. It was only open from 10-10pm (probably because that pool needs the lifeguards.) This pool was home to the waterslide and a beautiful rock waterfall. Both pools had full service bars and served food. Note: if you go to Disney in the summer, don't plan on cooling off in the pool. They feel like hot tubs. Another thing that set the Grand Floridian apart from the Polynesian and Contemporary is that it was the only resort that was actually cool and refreshing to walk into. We ate and shopped at both the Polynesian and Contemporary and they were pretty warm inside. The monorail is probably one of the main things that jacks up the price at the Floridian, but it is SO convenient. There is really not a bad thing to say about this hotel! From the moment we stepped off the Magical Express to the moment we stepped on, it was absolutely perfect.

The Victorian style views, inside and out are amazing! Our room had a fabulous view of the lagoon and the Magic Kingdom caslte. At night we were able to see the fire works from our balcony. The way the fire works reflected on the lagoon gave it an extra touch. I will hold that memory dear to my heart. The entire staff ( bell hop, valet, greeter, house keeper, concierge, etc.) were helpful and friendly. They always had a smile on their face. They did everything possible to make our stay more enjoyable. If you can afford it, we recommend the concierge service. The concierge lounge had delicious complimentary snacks, drinks, desserts from 7a.m to 10 p.m. We enjoyed the views and the music while we ate. Your concierge can also help you with tickets, reservations, or any questions you may have. Our concierge was able to help us extend our stay without us having to make more reservations. Our plans were to enjoy the Grand Floridian then move to the Contemporary resort. But after one day at the Grand we didn't want to leave! Our concierge was able to cancel our Contemporary reservation and extend our stay at the Grand while we enjoyed the theme parks. We didnt have to worry about anything. We stayed for 5 days and I wish we could have stayed for more. I would recommend this resort for a relaxing or romantic vacation. Tip: Use the boat transportation to get to the Magic Kingdom. The views are amazing! Take pictures!!! Tip: If you like it tropical, pick the Poly Resort, but ask for the lagoon view. If you like it modern, pick the Contemporary Resort, but ask for a lagoon view.

It always felt very relaxed and never hectic or busy and there always seemed to be an abundance of cast members around to assist you should you need anything.

That was not good for us because we had a 2.5 year old that stayed up. The halls are vacuumed every night between 3am-4am and that woke us up every night. The second morning we awoke to the grass being cut and men using blowers at 5am just outside our room. When I called to complain I was told that is just the time the landscape crew gets started. The last morning we were there I heard a very loud noise coming from the emergency stairwell at 3:45am. It woke all of us up and my wife asked for me to see what was going on, when I went into the stairwell a man was using a high speed drill to clean the stairs. I asked him to stop and he did thankfully but it was tough getting back to sleep.

But beware - food is expensive. Gasparillo's offers the cheapest deal, it is a 'cafe' with some loud slot machine games and tables overlooking a small marin. Best idea is to get a soda refill mug from there and soft drinks are free on tap for the rest of the holiday whilst in this resort. The ground floor Grand Floridian Cafe gave us a good meal, but at 115 dollars for a drink and main course each we found it tasty but expensive. Tipping is recommended at 18 - 20% on resort also.

I took advantage of their 40% Off room rate, & opted to go with the cheapest room available (Garden view). I believe I was upgrraded for I had a view of the lake/river...but was not told upon check-in of the upgrade, so your guess was as good as mine. I dont mind spending $500.00/night for a hotel room, but figured I'd only be sleeping here, and there was no need to spend more for a better view. I stayed here to celebrate my 40th birthday. Upon check-in, I was given a \"Happy Birthday\" button to wear, which I do suggest wearing for every character & Disney employee would wish me a \"Happy Birthday\". It actually was fun for the first day or two, for I would also get free birthday desserts when I went out to eat on Disney property. The room was spacious, again, even though I reserved the cheapest room available. It had a couch, flat-screen tv, full-size balcony with (2) wrought-iron chairs...which were not too comfy to sit on for a long time! Every room at this hotel has a balcony....but the views vary with each room. The monorail (located on the 2nd floor of the main bldg) was convenient, not waiting anymore than 5-minutes for one. The monorail makes exactly (5) stops only: \"Grand Floridian Hotel\", \"Magic Kindom\", \"Contemporary\" Hotel, \"TATC\" (ticket & transportation ctr), & \"Polynesian\". Its just loops all day to those (5) stops. if you want to go to \"Epcot\", you have to get off at the \"TATC\" (tickets & transportation ctr) and change to another monorail there to the \"Epcot\" monorail. If you want to go to \"Hollywood Studios (formally MGM studios), \"Downtown Disney\", \"Typhoon Lagoon\", or \"Animal Kindom\", you can only take the Disney Bus, for the monorail is not connected to those parks. The bus picks you up in the front of the \"Grand Floridian\" and runs every 15-20 minutes continously through-out the day/night. All free, of course! Getting back to teh hotel itself..........it is beautiful!! The pictures do not do it justice. I agree with other reviewers when they say they could get a better room for cheaper money if they stayed at a Hyatt or Four Seasons.....but the \"Floridian\" is the best Disney Property if you want the convenience of being on Disney grounds...which was perfect for us...for when it got too hot or if it rained, we were able to hop on the monorail or bus back to the hotel in a jiffy, and then back to the parks later in the evening, with little or no effort. So, if you want the convenience, then stay here. If that does not matter, and you want more bang for your buck, & dont mind driving your car & sitting in traffic to get to the parks, then stay off grounds. Our room was furthest from the main building, but, again, I didnt care...for the walk didnt bother me. The room was quiet, clean, and very big! We had an end-unit room, but never heard our neighbor on the other side.

We found the music kind of relaxing to to listen to as we put our son down for nap; and very pleasant to wake from nap. Others might find it as bothersome. Our room was nearly right above the band on the 3rd floor and we were impressed at how well the noise was muffled.

We stayed at the Grand Floridian for 3 Nights which we were very excited about especially as were were delayed for 10 days because of the volcanic ash. I have to say apon arrival we were very impressed with the valet service etc...But be warned they charge you $12 a day for this service. I was angry at this, we had spent so much money on the hotel alone not including the tickets and the delux dinning plan. We checked in and they were able to give us a room straight away which I was thankful for. However considering that we paid so much the room was tiny. There were two queen beds which was fine but hardly any space for my sons cot so we had to smush him in! I noticed some ants in the bathroom that evening after a long long day at epcot but ignored them as there were only a few. In the morning there were a few more so I rang down and was promised that the pest controller would come up. I then picked up a bag from the corner of the room and it was covered in ants. I was bitten all over my hand and arm. I was so upset at this point my one or 3 year old could have picked that up, not to mention they were all over my husbands shoes! I would have expected this from a $50 a night motel not a $400 delux hotel. I rand again and I dont know wether they couldnt understand my accent but there was no appologie and again just another empty promise of the pest controller. All of this made us late for a breakfast reservation at ohanas. Needless to say that day I was very ancixious and upon returning from the magic kindgom very hot a tired the ants were still there all over the floor. I called several times and finaly a very nice man came up and we moved rooms. I had very high expectations as you would when you are promised such amazing things and felt so horrid when my children had to see their mother upset at the happiest place on earth! I cant say that I will be staying there again. I know the ants were s fluke but they should be checked. That room couldnt have been empty for long its a busy resort someone must have noticed them.

Well, I finally had my chance to and I couldn't pass it up! I took my 2 nephews (ages 7 & 3) as well as my mother. We had limos take us to and from MCO as my first and only experience with the Magical Express left a rotten taste in my mouth and made we want to say Magical my....well, fill in the blank. Seriously, save yourself the aggravation and rent a car or get car service (you will thank me later!). Now back to the glory that is the Grand Floridan. As soon as our limo pulled up, someone came out to unload our bags and direct us to the front desk. No on was actually in line to check-in, so right up to the counter I went. (Well up to the counter I went after we were dumbstruck by the awe that is the Grand Floridian main lobby during Christmas time...the tree...the gingerbread house..I don't know who was more fascinated myself or my newphews.) The lady that checked us in was super sweet and fast! I think it took us 7 minutes before she was telling me we had been upgraded and handed me our keys to the world. The man who took us and our bags to our room in his golf cart gave us a tour of the grounds since it was our first stay. We were in the Big Pine Key building. This building is closest to the main building, closest to the themed pool and furthest from the marina as well as Gasparilla's Grill. We had a lagoon view room and could watch the electric water parade from our balcony! The boys loved watching all the boats in the lagoon and every night we fell asleep to the sound of the boat horns. Gasparilla's grill was fantastic for a counter service restaurant. I could eat there every day and not get sick of it...plus you can sit outside and watch the monorails go around, look at the castle (watch it change colors), watch the fireworks and the boats in the lagoon. The food portions are large and everything was fresh! Sometimes it took longer then it should have for them to make the orders, but all you have to do is ask where your food is and then 5 minutes later it would finally be ready. 1900 Park Fare for breakfast was FANTASTIC! Great food and even better character interaction. Bus service was fast! We were waiting first thing in the morning to go to the Animal Kingdom for our before the park actually opens Donald's Safari breakfast...the man that works in the bus waiting area actually called a bus for us to take us there. We were the only ones on the bus! Now, how cool is that?!? Service really doesn't get any better than that! Plus, the monorail is right there and the first stop is the Magic Kingdom! Transportation from this resort was nothing short of fantastic! No complaints from this very impatient lady :) We would be out at the parks and the boys would stop and look at my mother and I, then ask, \"can we go back home? \"<--they were meaning the Grand Floridian! Of course, how do you tell them no??? So, back \"home\" we went! We would play in the pools, go down the waterslide, run along the beach and just be silly. The rooms were nicer than they come across as in pictures and spotlessly clean. The beds were very comfy. The walls are a bit thin though, and we never could find the Disney Channel that constantly plays old Disney movies. I know it's there somewhere...we used to watch it at the Contemporary. Anyways, we took advantage of the character wake up calls and the boys would switch off who got to answer the phone. (Disney, if you would put speaker phones in the room, it would save lots of fights over who gets to answer the phone!) Whatever they use that gives the Grand Floridian, the outer building;s lobbies, and the rooms that beautiful aroma is remarkable. I wish I could buy it, because it was a very fresh and happy scent. Not overwhelming at all; just very nice. When we were leaving, my nephews wanted to know why we couldn't just stay and live there. I told them, unfortunately Aunt Aimee has to go back to work so that we can return. If only I could live at the Grand Floridian, I surely would! We loved it SO much here, that we had to book a bounceback offer while there. We are going back in October for 7 nights/ 8 days (this stay was for 4 nights/5 days). When I told my nephews we were going back to Disney; their 1st and only question was, \"are we going \"home\"?\" I said, of course we are...where else would we stay?!? So, back to the Grand Floridian, or home, it is!

As soon as the Magical Express Bus dropped me off at the front of the hotel, there were greeters there to check me into our room. The other three women in my room, did not show up until later and they had a fantastic welcoming to the property too! In fact, since we were staying in a club level room in the main building, we were checked into our room by the concierge staff right in our room; we never even saw the front desk. In the main building of the Grand Floridian Hotel the club level rooms are only in the 3rd to 5th floors and you need a special room key to get to those floors. So it makes it pretty exclusive. The view from our room faced one of the pools with a waterfull right there and the sandy beach in the background, it was amazing! We loved everything about the hotel! The restaurants that we tried were suitable to their level of service, especially Victoria and Alberts! The hotel had great little shops to browse around, and the spa was out of this world! Also, the hotel had live entertainment every night in the main building to make you feel welcome! The only complaint that I had was the bed was not very comfortable and I did not sleep much the majority of the trip because of that. Also, one of the ladies slept on the daybed and the air conditioning vent kept blowing cold air right onto her face every night and we were not able to control the temperature of the thermostat! In fact, she had to sleep with a hooded sweatshirt just to keep her face warm, it was almost as cold as a blizzard in that part of the room! One of the concierge level staff, Vonnie was wonderful about cancelling a few reservations and getting us a reservation for breakfast at Cinderella's castle at the last minute!. Everything she did was great; most of the other staff were great except for one gentleman. Before Vonnie got us a reservation at Cinderella's castle, I had asked one of the other concierge level staff to work on trying to get us a reservation to dine in the Castle and he said,\"Well, you can always call the Walt Disney World dining line to get a reservation. What did we pay extra money for to have club level service, if we have to do those type of things ourselves? I had already booked most of our dinner reservations far in advance so the staff did not have to do much for us the nine nights that we stayed at the hotel.

We came here with pretty low expectations and they were exceeded, which was a nice surprise. No one coming here should expect a Four Seasons or a Ritz Carlton. You will be disappointed. When you come here, you are largely paying for convenience. You won't need a car to see anything Disney-related and if money's not a huge object, you won't need to venture off the monorail line for food. The Magic Kingdom is not even five minutes away by monorail. We got a great deal on the room due to a sale and after staying here I'm pretty sure I would stay again if I could get another good price. I would not stay here at full (Four Seasons-comparable) prices. We found the resort itself - the grounds and buildings - to be quite pretty, and not in a cheesy-Victorian kind of way. There are two pools - one with graduated entry and a slide and waterfall (which was more crowded) and one which seemed to attract mostly adults near the hot tub (which was a bit quieter). We found them more than adequate for late-afternoon swims. We stayed on the club floor of the main building. The club lounge was large, pretty, and we were happy with what it offered. The continental breakfast was more or less what you'd get on a club floor of the Ritz Carlton - cereals, breads/croissants, fruit, cheese, yogurt...etc. The lunch offerings were more snack-like but the afternoon tea was pretty good (scones were tasty), as were the desserts at night. They are great with the beverages and you can take things with you to the room and to the parks (which sort of surprised me) - I was filling up a couple of glasses of water one night to take to the room and the woman who works there just gave me a couple of large bottles of water. Same with sodas. There's also a nice espresso/cappucino machine as well as brewed coffee, iced tea and juices. Also, any entertainment (there's a daily pianist and a band) is in the open lobby so you get to hear it. There are also kiddie tables and chairs with Disney movies playing and a sitting area with sofas and a tv tuned to the news. It was a nice place to relax. The service at the hotel, with few exceptions, was fantastic. The staff is exceedingly friendly, and even though the place is fairly high-end, there are a lot of kids running around and the kid-friendliness of the whole place was nice. In particular, the restaurants at the resort were great for kids; I have never seen a better children's menu anywhere (kid-friendly appetizers - what a great idea!). The concierges were knowledgeable and helpful with dinner reservations and other suggestions of things to do (at the resort and also regarding park hours, etc.). They were not as great as Four Seasons concierges but they served their purpose and were about on par with most Ritz Carlton concierges in our experience. My husband had some work to do while we were staying here and he noted that the business center was sub-par. Though I doubt most people stay here and need the business center, it's probably worth noting. We found the biggest \"downside\" (if you could call it that) to be the actual rooms. They are really nothing to write home about. Marginally better than your average Marriott, maybe. They are in dire need of a face lift. They were clean and had a refrigerator, they were nicely (though not lavishly by any means) furnished, and they were adequate. Not really on par with the rest of the hotel, we thought. The toiletries were surprisingly nice, however. One odd thing we noticed was the tv channels available in the room. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there was only one Disney Channel available in the way of kid's channels. No Nickelodeon, no Sprout. Bring your own DVDs if you've got little kids, because if you do, you probably know that the Disney Channel has a lot of programming for the older kiddie set. Fortunately, there was not a lot of time for watching tv (just one night when it was raining - after enjoying some dessert in the lounge). All things considered, we had a great stay. It was convenient, clean, and nicer than we expected. It made seeing the parks a breeze, and it was great to be able to come and go so easily (particularly to the Magic Kingdom, which you can get to by boat or monorail). Also, as a bonus, from the dock at the hotel, you have a great view of the Magic Kingdom fireworks at night. The club/concierge floor was also well worth it.

This review is aimed for similar parents used to top quality hotels but who may be apprehensive about booking the Grand Floridian. My family and I stayed 8 nights starting 30 March. With three kids under 11 I wanted the convenience of the Disney theme parks but with as close to my Four Seasons normality as possible. I would rate the GF as a 4+ star hotel. Not dissimilar to some of the Hyatt Regency hotels I have stayed in but with a spectacular five star lobby. Actually the rooms are not far off five star. The beds are excellent and pillows great. Soundproofing is pretty good. The bathrooms are very clean but bath/shower had a curtain (not 5 star) and the toilet edge was around 2 inches from the door when opened. Double sinks were great. By the way the comment from another reviewer about wet carpets is a plus. They are steam cleaned every week or so. Carpets in our room were immaculate when we arrived, which judging by what my kids dropped and spilt is a good thing. All restaurants were great and Park Fayre character breakfast good fun but pricey. Pool areas were fine and beach good, although there were not enough sunchairs at peak time and apparently reserved. Obviously too many Germans were staying (joke!). The gym at the spa was adequate for my needs, although the equipment a little tired. So with some investment in the bathrooms I think the resort could make a play for a five star rating in the future, should it desire. We compared GF with the Polynesian and Contemporary. Neither were our cup of tea. In fact I saved a lot of USD by switching from Polynesian Club Floor to GF Garden Rooms and taking the disney deluxe dining plan option, which was fantastic. Parents wanting a glass of wine or two on the balcony in the evening but reluctant to pay USD10 per glass or USD40 per bottle on room service should order from ABC Wines in Orlando before arrival and who will deliver to your hotel via fedex. One final tip - take the monorail to MK but the boat back. Each is only one stop. GF honestly exceeded my expectations. I left agreeing with the family that we would come back again one day.

Not only were the items in our room waiting when we got there, after grabbing a quick bite to eat, but items for us as well. During our stay one of our boys fell in the lobby gift shop and was hurt. Immediately the hotel called 911 and several employees kept him company with us as we waited for the EMT to arrive. Everyday after someone from the hotel asked us or him directly how he was doing.

The monorail stops right outside the lobby so easy access to Magic Kingdom and other parks on the monorail system. The restaurants are among the best at Disney and you can see the fireworks over the Magic Kingdom from your table.

That along with the early park hours worked very well. We didn't spend a lot of time at the two pools, but they did the trick (especially with the water slide) when we had the downtime. It was difficult to get chairs though, not a shocker. A few things that could be better were the food, television choices, and internet access. The food isn't that great, but we didn't eat in the higher end spots with the kids. The television channels are limited, with most of them being poorly programmed Disney World channels.

The hotel and surrounding areas are neat and tidy and all of the staff are really pleasant and helpful-just as you would expect in a Disney resort. We had a spacious, light and airy lagoon view room with two king beds (good pillows), tea/coffee making facilities and plenty of crockery and glasses. The bathroom was small but adequate and everything was kept in good condition and very clean. Minor niggles that the shower head was not adjustable and the toilet flushing was very noisey. However housekeeping overall was excellent. Very little noise from adjacent rooms although there could be as our room had connecting doors with one other room so obviously used at certain times for families. Room had a balcony with a nice view across the lagoon towards the Polynesian resort and we could see the nightly lagoon light show on the lake. The hotel grounds are pleasant to walk in even as far as the Polynesian resort and the Disney transport centre. At night you can sit and watch the Magic Kingdom fireworks without leaving the site. The lagoon cruisers and the monorail connect to the parks from the hotel. We were here for the parks so did not use any of the restaurants but all looked good (but expensive) and you can have \"in room\" dining if you wish. We simply bought food from the fast food restaurant on a couple of nights and did our own dining-in arrangements. We did have a car so toured around as well. Do go and see the disney town called Celebration (it`s rather parochial) but has a great American diner (sit at the counter) and find the Cracker Barrel store(s)/restaurant(s) for great atmosphere, super service and great food.

The architecture, ambiance, landscaping and cleanliness are world class, but the rooms and guest experience are distinctly NOT 5 star. The food at Gasparillias Grill is a crime against hotel guests. Absolutely ATROCIOUS (and overpriced). We had the distinct honor of trying to eat the worst re-heated factory made frozen pizza that we have ever tasted. Actually, the pizza had no taste whatsoever. It was just a factory prepared shot of stale cheese and empty carbs. The bath products offered in this supposedly luxury hotel are low -end and have not been upgraded for 15 years. The TV selections in the room are lmited, sub par and focus on Disney Infommercials. Can't even get FoxNews, which we prefer to watch over spiels about Disney Vacation Club, or repetitive ;oops on what to do at Disney. The process of making a reservation has been and is becoming increasingly obnoxious. Disney now has a robot that asks you 14 unnecessary questions before allowing you to find out if a hotel is even available during your stay. What is really insulting and offensive is that even though we are frequent guests at the Grand Floridian ,spending thousands of dollars every year, they hassle us with confirming phone numbers, emails, ages of children, date of last stay, before even letting you talk to somebody who might know if a room is available. All of this would be unnecessary if their central reservation system could just look up our info by phone number (This is ignoring the fact that it is extremely gauche to badger your \"guests\" at the onset of their \"magical\" experience, with an onslaught of intrusive, unnecessary, rude and time consuming questions. How un-magical. What a hassle. No other hotel in the world has such an obstructionist process to make a reservation. We understand the difficulty of giving a 5 star experience to a large hotel full of children, but there are many little things that could be done to improve the experience for the guests. There is a constant parade of golf carts, maintenance vehicles, houeskeeping wagons, utility golf carts etc parading along the sidewalks during all waking hours. I counted 25 in an afternoon at the pool, and we are invariably assaulted by 3 or so as we transit from our room to the main building. It is impossible to catch a nap at the pool because of the frequenet trundling of these vehicles hauling laundry etc around the property. It did not used to be like this -- something has changed (perhaps a new general manger not interested in guest experience?) Pool side food service at this supposedly luxury hotel consists of an extremely limited selection of tasteless entrees carelessly prepared, served in plastic containers, admist a swarm of seagulls. No linenes, no silverware, no service. Just -- here is your high priced, processed, gross food. Hurry up and eat it. If you are a family with kids and don't care about price or quality, just convenience to the Monorail, this may be your place. However, if you are a discriminating traveler with higher standards -- especially at $500/night, you will be disappointed. We try to accentuate the many positives of the Grand Floridian while we stay here, but lately (the last 5 years), things are definitely becoming less tolerable.

Those rooms are on the same end (and right across) from the eating area!!!

On a separate note, Kent in the concierge dining area couldn't have been nicer and more professional. He placed some special treats in the room to help celebrate our son's b-day and really took his job seriously! Maybe they should let him design the room layout?

Like anything else in life, it is all in outlook. Clearly, it is the \"best\" Disney has to offer, the location is awesome, the pictures online are very nice, and clearly the prices it asks for its rooms match that attitude, but in my opinion this hotel falls majorly short if you are a family that is looking for luxury service and treatment. It took me a few days staying here to realize that Disney is not marketing to families like us- who are looking for the finer things- and we should take our business elsewhere; off disney premises. We actually stayed in a suite on the concierge floor boasting special food and a VIP concierge. I can't imagine these concierge suite patrons being happy as they are paying a fortune for terrible service; getting no more than regular patrons. First, I never saw the concierge once since we were there. When I did seek the \" special\" concierge down for a question by phone, they often wouldn't call back with my answer, and did not seem knowledgable about any restaurants or venues outside of Disney. It was like they wanted to keep us in Disney, spending money in Disney and kept referring us back to Disney establishments when we wanted to explore a bit more of Orlando. Once, we requested a babysitter, and they referred us a sitter who was not bonded. OMG! We had to pay her cash at the end of the night. So shady! Like the pp said, the maid service was terrible. Turn down service was almost never done, half drank diet coke cans and half eaten apples sat for days in our room, the lock on our door was broken and the worst part was that no one even cared. Every evening, we would have to pull out out couches and make up the beds for my daughters. I was changing the sheets! Begging for towels. The rooms are worn and sort of mismatched. Looks kind of like a Holiday Inn. Food at the hotel was terrible.... the Gasparilla grill was the worst! I am still sick thinking about the food at this cafe. The pool area was also very disappointing. Many days, one of the two pools was closed for repair. Another day the hot tub was closed for repair. There was no food or beverage service by the pool. You have to walk to the cafe to get food and bring it out to the pool. Imagine having to pull two screaming kids out of the pool to take this cold hike.... Fun, fun! So, my recommendations: Next time I would stay at the Waldorf Astoria Orlando. Beautiful, great great service, just opened, and connected to the new Hilton-- it has so much luxury and class and yet, the kids can use the pool in the Hilton- waterslides and a floating river. They provide Shuttles and first class service to the monorail (only 5 mins away) and things around disney too that (like Seaworld and Universal)... We hired a private VIP tour guide to take us through the Disney theme parks and were able to skip all the lines and get great seating for the parades, etc... That was awesome and well worth the $$. I would recommend the Royal Table at Cinderella's Castle for breakfast, and the Bibbity Bobbity Boutique. My 4 year old had a blast! At the breakfast, she met all 4 princesses (it would have taken us hours to stand in line and meet everyone separately) and I felt it was so magical.... Lastly, for dinners, I would recommend Flying Fish (Excellent!) and California Grill (wonderful view to see the fireworks). All of this requires reservations well in advance! Good luck! Have fun!

We were happy with our room although we couldn't get the king bed we had requested in advance. Getting the upgrade to concierge overcame our disappointment with the smaller queen bed. We had a nice view of the pool area. We had a few minor complaints like: The lighting in the room wasn't very good, in fact the bathroom was quite dark even though they had about 4 lights in there; the shower head didn't work very well; we didn't like the bedding; also the walls are thin but the hotel wasn't very noisey. I'm surprised by the complaints about food in DW. We had great meals every day! Granted we had dinner every night at a \"signature\" restaurant. They were all excellent. I liked Flying Fish the best but Artist Point was also excellent. We had lunch at several restaurants and thought San Angel was extremely good. The only restaurant which we didn't think was good at all was Raglan's Irish restaurant in DT disney. It was really badly managed with slow confused service and mediocre food. The staff at GF were great. WE had a couple of complaints about the heat and the remote control for the tv, and they were quickly fixed. It's a beautiful hotel. Convenient to the parks, and some other hotels on the monorail. We visited most of the other DW hotels, and we were very glad we stayed at the GF.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cBeyond Wonderful\u201d", "Author": "oodlesofnoodles1", "ReviewID": "UR56358385", "Content": "I have been to Disney World too many times to count, and each time we always hit GF for breakfast or supper, loving the wonderful style and surroundings.

To be honest I wasn't expecting much, relatively nice but a little dated. This was completely opposite to the experience I had. We had a theme park view in Boca Chica - Lagoon view was wonderful, and the castle was clear from our balcony. Not only this, but I woke up to views of Space Mountain each morning - not too bad!!!! The room was beautiful, and very large. It was immaculately clean, as was the whole of the hotel, and when we arrived there was a white chocolate mickey, as well as a plate of chocolates and a birthday card. It was a great surprise. Each night we sat and watched the water parades which sailed right by our balcony. The fireworks were incredible as always and even better when viewed in pjs away from the crowds. When we were there we decided to try the spa for convenience. It was surprisingly well priced and the treatments I had (facial, massage, mani, ped) were beyond fantastic, and after the pedicure you get a little bag with a pedicure kit and nail colour of choice. We ate at Narcoosees and had a fabulous lobster supper which was only complimented by a view of the castle There were absolutely no negatives to the trip which was meant to be our last.

The hotel is beautiful and if you plan to spend much of your time at the Magic Kingdom, the location can not be beat. The breakfast and afternoon tea offerings in the Sugar Loaf Club were great, however the evening offerings left alot to be desired (items that were supposed to be hot were cold, trays not replenished in a timely manner, etc.) and the late-night sweets consisted of a small tray of what looked like leftover pastries from the Garden View Lounge in the main building. The room was well-kept and cleaned. The first day our room was not made up until almost 4 p.m.. After that we caught the housekeeper in the hall for a few mornings to let her know we were leaving and from then on out our room was cleaned earlier. On the downside, other than the housekeeping staff we found the service here to be sub-par from almost everyone we dealt with -- from bell services to the concierge staff in Sugar Loaf right on up to the manager of Narcoossee's. The general attitude of the staff was cold and aloof. I felt the staff in the lobby of Sugar Loaf worked hard to avoid eye contact at all times--even when they weren't helping guests they kept their eyes downward staring intently at their computer screens. We were rarely greeted when we passed the staff and even the greeter on the upper level of the main building (near the monorail station ) never greeted us on any of the many times we came in that way and that's his specific job! Most times we passed him he actually had his back to the guests and was leaning over the railing to check out the action downstairs. The staff generally put off an air that they could not care less that we were there -- almost as if we weren't worthy of being in their presence -- and they subtly let it be known that when they did help you you were putting them out. It was really strange. My husband's birthday was during the trip and I'd asked the IPO to note that on our reservation but I'm not sure it was because it was never acknowledged during our stay. I wasn't expecting anything huge, but usually when that's on your reservation somewhere along the line you get a card or something in the room or at one of your meals. We also did not get the room-type we requested but were luckily able to switch rooms. The soundproofing between rooms was not great. We could often hear the children to one side of us and the tv in the room to te other side of us. All in all, I'm not sure I would stay at this hotel again (I've stayed at about a dozen different Disney hotels and know there is better service out there) and I definitely woudn't do club level here again -- not worth the money.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cSublimely Kid friendly.\u201d", "Author": "Bicycle_Rider", "ReviewID": "UR54883320", "Content": "Where else can you enjoy 4 star dining with 5 year olds seated at most of the tables?

The orchestra and piano player were both a treat! A few bad points unfortunately........We had called the hotel directly before our arrival to request that our room not be on the ground floor and also to inquire about any special notice we might expect as we were celebrating a graduation and had noted that on our reservation. We were told that our request for other than ground floor was noted and that at some point during our stay a congratulatory card would be placed in the room. We were given a ground floor room - we called the front desk and were told to return to the lobby and then we were given a room on the 5th floor of another building. The day prior to our departure we had yet to receive the promised congratulatory card. I went down to the front desk and the clerk looked through the book and it had not been noted. I found this very frustrating! Also told the clerk a couple of things about the room that were annoying - no dvd player as was listed on website when we made reservation, light bulb out in lamp for 2 days, fire escape route on back of door had the wrong room (one at the nearly the other end of the building) marked on it (I had checked that one day when looking for stairs to exit rather than use the elevator). The clerk was very nice and said she would get someone to talk to me - went to talk to someone for about 5 minutes - but no one came to talk to me. I found this somewhat dismissive. The good news is that the items I mentioned were taken care of immediately - upon our return to the room that day there was a great card and balloons, dvd player hooked up, and light bulb changed. A housekeeper came to the door and put in a fire escape route. Overall, I think this is a very nice hotel, but the room was not worth the price. However, the convenience of the monorail, the beautiful lobby and grounds are worth spending extra for this resort over some of the others.

Imagine my surprise when we pulled into the Grand Floridian! As a Florida native, it had always been my dream to stay at Disney's flagship resort, and he had made my dreams come true! Upon entering the building, the staff was so friendly and accommodating and everyone asked if you were having a good day and smiled. I had never received such warm hospitality at any hotel before; even other Disney Resorts. You should definitely go on your birthday, because everyone, guests as well as staff, were wishing you a happy birthday! I felt so special! The decor and surroundings were second to none, and as Grand as you would expect from Disney. There were fun hidden Mickey's all over the place; I had a blast seeking them out! Getting back to the actual room - our first room was over by the Lake and we were a little discouraged to see that there was construction in front and around our building - very LOUD cranes and diggers...yuck. We went into the room and the noise was unbearable. The bed was a Queen and it was supposed to be a King; I went out on the balcony and the crane was right in front of me. I was not happy. We went back to the front desk and the staff was very accommodating. We were then given a key to the main building elevator, which lead us to the concierge level! What a way to compensate! We had never been treated with such concern by the Mouse before! Our room was large and beautiful with a balcony facing the lake and beach area. The concierge made our dinner reservations and was extremely accommodating to our last minute requests and we were treated to extra hours at the Magic Kingdom through 2a that morning. At various times throughout the day, the concierge level presented desserts, sandwiches, finger foods and beer, wine and other drinks. The drinks were available 24 hours a day. Before dinner, I arrived to the room to change and there was a personalized pink birthday cake waiting for me! It was chocolate and yummy! I was very surprised. After dinner, which we ate at one of the restaurants on site, we arrived back to our room and there was a large white chocolate Mickey Mouse, a card, and cookies, and chocolate covered strawberries saying Happy Birthday along with beautiful flowers in a Minnie Mouse vase.

I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine going any other time of year now that we know what Christmas is like at the hotel and in the parks. Over the years, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at a variety of hotels on and off the Disney property. Since we get two connecting rooms and have two young kids (4 and 8) in our group, the Grand Floridian is now our favorite location. The monorail is at the Magic Kingdom in one stop, the boat is the first stop coming back and when the kids are tired they can easily return to the hotel for a nap and rejoin the group later. I read the recent Trip Advisor reviews before we left and was prepared for some maintenance work to be continuing while we were there and it was. The tile in the main building is almost done now and some other minor work was occurring, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be expected with a property as old as the GF so it can maintain its grand stature as the years roll on. Both pools were open, we were greeted with apple cider and roasted chestnuts upon arrival and the customer service was great which has been our normal. We have stayed in Sugar Loaf (club level) the last two years and the food and service there have been exceptional. All the staff we encountered were very dedicated and gracious with a very diverse customer base (lots of foreign visitors with limited English, kids getting into everything, spills, special requests, etc.). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m surprised they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pulling their hair out some mornings just observing what they had to deal with. Since we like the location, food, service, pools, decorations, convenience, etc. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back again next year if the price is right . . . which it was this year. We did experience some issues that other reviewers described with the Magical Express, which was a first for us. Normally its organized chaos, but this time it was just plain chaos squared . . . no cubed. There was a line that extended beyond the rental car area and seemed like it was longer then a football field. We stood in it awhile, but when we got to the desk there was a different line and we were confused as to which one we should be in so we jumped out of the very long one we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been in forever and stood in line at the desk only to find out we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to stand in either one of them (I bet you can guess our reaction). The guy at the counter told us that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why everyone was standing in that long line and that we could just get in the line to the far right that was loading onto the bus, which we did. At one point in the chaos, I even priced a van to see what it would cost us to forego all the lines, but it was very high as I expected it would be. The crowd could have been easily managed with someone just communicating with people as they arrived and steering them into the different bus queues or directing them to the counter if there was an issue. The employees appeared oblivious to the crowds and we thought they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d let people back up in line until they ran right out the terminal doors on the other side without a care. Disney has to know they have an issue with the contractor providing this service and if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deal with it before next year; we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in the line to nowhere again. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just check TripAdvisor up until decision time and find another way to get to the GF if the problem isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed. The only other issue I had with Disney is the one I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always had and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the online reservation process. It has improved somewhat, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not best in class as if it should be. In my case, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow me to not put my name on one of the rooms I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paying for which causes a cascade of problems with the Magical Express baggage tags, food vouchers, etc. (since my name is on both rooms, I get two sets of everything). The only way I can fix it is to call reservations and sit on hold forever while I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paying for the call. I decided this year after a couple of attempts to call them that I was going to give up trying to fix their problem and let them deal with it after we arrived with luggage tags corrected by hand, messed up meal cards, etc. I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to work at getting Disney to take my money, it should be as easy as it is in the park . . . just swipe the card and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got the money from the correct person. Our return to the airport wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as eventful, but we knew from last year to get our bags checked in and boarding passes early at the hotel since they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re extremely slow and lines grow quickly. We were the only ones in line and it still took them a long time just to get our boarding passes. If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had access to a printer, I would have skipped that part since I could have done it in 5 minutes. If Disney doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t improve the overall Magical Express process, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have more people looking for other transportation avenues. Considering everything, we had a fun trip and will most likely do it again, but Disney needs to address the aggravation factors they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got growing in some areas. We also noted for the first time that two rides in the Magic Kingdom (Carousel of Progress and Pirates of the Caribbean) had maintenance issues and closed intermittently and we got stuck in the big \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ball\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Epcot for about 15 minutes. We got very tired of seeing Rome burning after awhile and the kids were getting a little frightened being stuck in the dark on an incline. I hope this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean Disney is skimping on routine maintenance in the parks. I guess we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see if everything is back to normal or not next year.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roslyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, perfect location.\u201d", "Author": "67corvette", "ReviewID": "UR51476534", "Content": "We embarked on our family 5 day trip to Disney Oct 21-25th, 9 people in all, with 3 little girls ages 6, 4, and 2.

Enough about the hotel Meals: Do the meal plan, we did deluxe dining which entitles you to 3 sit down meals, although we did the fast food in the park for lunch, we used those meals for the more exp 2 meal dinner restaurants. Plus the food is so expensive it pays to use the meal plan, for ex: buffets for bkfst are $36/adult. Avoid the crystal palace, we did this for dinner and it was horrible, food was a low end buffet. we chose this for the first night as to get the kids excited about the characters this was Winnie the pooh and tigger and friends but everyone all with reservation were waiting on average 30-45 minutes, The waiting area outside the front entrance was so crowded and tough to keep the tired kids entetained while we waited and waited (45 min). We then went from this restaurant to the spectromagic parade, this is a dont miss, we all enjoyed. Try to stand by the front entrance as this way you can bolt out to the monorail or boats when the parade is over. Character breakfasts were key, they were buffet but you cant really mess up pancakes, eggs, etc. Chef mickey in the contemporary hotel was great, meeting mickey and friends, Akershus in Norway at epcot was fantastic for meeting the princesses, although this was the worst food of the breakfast buffets. 1900 park place was great for alice and wonderland and mary poppins and in the GF and finally the hollywood and vine was fun and interactive for the kids, dancing with the characters of little einsteins. Make sure you buy the autograph books in the hotel lobby or in the park to get all the signatures. Subsequently we have printed out all the picutes of the characters and put them next to the autographs in the book. Dinners: the California Grille on top of the contemp hotel was fantastic, nyc quality at 2x the price thankful that we had the dining plan! seriously thou our best meal, followed closely by the Citricos in the GF. We also ate at the Brown derby in hollywood studios, way overrated food was like going to a sizzler. The Parks, We had a guide for MK and HS he was excellent, sunstate tours and reasonably priced. We were able to use the fast pass lines for all rides, a must. Magic Kingdom was great for kids our age, they really enjoyed the rides. Hollywood studios was good for them as well, my 6 year old loved toy story mania, we went on it twice, even us adults liked it. You definitely dont need a full day here. Epcot was a little tough for our kids, not alot for them to do. They had little interest in the countries. BUT dont miss the test track ride and SOARIN, we all thought it was great., get the fast pass for this before you even have breakfast and then go back after you eat and walk right on. We did not rent a car and were fine with taking either the monorail or the disney buses to the parks. Each night we would get back and put the kids to sleep and within minutes they were out as each day it was record hot 89-91 degrees. My wife and i were also exhausted each day, as we ran around with them, swam, went to dinner, it was non stop. Also checking the luggage the morning of departure at the hotel was fantastic, we didnt see it again until we landed back in NY. Overall, the hotel is centrally located and the pools, snack bar, restaurants, etc were great.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SC", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "mdl955", "ReviewID": "UR51419677", "Content": "The Magical Express was more of a nightmare than anything else.

The lobby bar is so small, and nothing else is open for adults to just sit an relax at with a cocktail. Not impressed at all. No shower cap, which is a minor detail, but, hey, for the cost of the room, please be sure all the amenities, however small, are in the room. My sisters, who left before us, missed their Magical \"Nightmare\" Express because they showed up, literally at 10:26am for a 10:25 call. If the bus was going to leave prior to the 10:25am call, that should have been stated in the paperwork they left hanging on our doors, ie 'be sure to arrive 15 minutes etc. prior to your departure time from the resort.' Calling the operator was a joke. Took forever for someone to answer, and then, when they did, they weren't even in the hotel!

Been upgraded to Club Room which was a pleasant surprise... although I didn't really use the concierge service, the snacks and breakfast were delicious. .Nice variety of fine dining... which is a real rarity in Disney parks. . Although the main pool was under maintenance, the heated adult pool was beautiful. The bad side: . Although the hotel is surely Grand, I'm not fully convinced it is worth the price, as there are many other nice resorts in the area at lower rates (including some Disney resorts). . We had to wait in a very long line to get the Disney bus from the airport, and the bus we travelled into was apparently much older then the ones to other resorts. I feel that, if you are staying in Disney's prime hotel, you should have a prime treatment, with exclusive line and transportation, and not the same kind of service you would get in a All Star Resort. . The same would go for the buses around the Disney complex. The Grand Floridian is the last stop of the buses. Doesn't an exclusive resort deserve and exclusive bus to parks? I have visited most of the other Disney Resorts during my stay and the Grand Floridian is far the most beautiful.

While I have vacationed at Walt Disney World several times in the past, this was my first experience with just my husband. Before going, I worried that it wouldn't be as fun since we weren't with a group or kids, but the trip turned out to be one of our best vacation experiences to date. Disney's Magical Express Transfer: We arrived at MCO and as the owner of a travel agency, I opted to try the Disney's Magical Express instead of renting a car or hiring private pick-up. I'm so glad that we did this because all you have to do is walk down to the baggage claim area and get in line to get on your bus. There are several buses that go to the various resorts. They handle your luggage so you can begin relaxing immediately. I would suggest bringing a few dollars to tip the driver as they make you forget that you are on a motorcoach with other guests. The ride to the resort lasts about 25 minutes and there is a cute movie shown during the ride. Our bus stopped to drop people off at the Polynesian resort, then dropped us off at the Grand Floridian and continued to the Contemporary. Dropping other guests off didn't take long at all. Check-in: We were greeted as we stepped off the Magical Express and a bellman took our luggage. We were supposed to have a garden-view room, but since we were celebrating our anniversary and my husband's birthday a few months late, we were kindly upgraded to an amazing room in the Boca Chica building and couldn't have been more happy. Thank you David! We were also given neat anniversary pins and my husband was given one for his birthday. We were them most of the week and I recommend doing the same if you are celebrating something special. The front desk staff were so kind and extremely organized and happy to answer any questions we had. The room: We were given a ride via golf cart to our room in the Boca Chica Building. It was on the top floor and highlights included the king bed, flat screen tv and incredible view of the Magic Kingdom castle and Space Mountain. We were right on the water and could watch the light show on the water each night as well as the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom. They pipe in the sound. For the most part, we had a quiet stay. The resort was about 50% occupied and the only time we heard anyone in our room was when a group of kids ran down the hall screaming. Mousekeeping did a great job and I loved the H20 plus shampoo. The bathroom was pretty standard, but served it's purpose. We had a nice little sitting area with a love seat and chaise. Two sinks in the bathroom with ample space for both of us to spread out our stuff. They provide robes and slippers as well as a safe. Oh, there is also a refrigerator in the room- very handy. There are 8 buildings (I think) that make up the Grand Floridian. I honestly don't think you could go wrong with any of them. The staff do such an incredible job and each building has it's own advantages. They are close together, but if walking is an issue, I recommend you stay in the main building since you are right at the monorail. Food: We had room-service daily for breakfast and the French toast is out of this world! We tried it for dinner once or twice and it was great too. Quick service. We also picked up things at the Gasperilla Grill numerous times. They have great turkey wraps! Also, Gasperilla has mainly American food: burgers, chicken nuggets, pizza, drinks, cookies, cereals. We had brunch at the Grand Floridian Cafe the day we arrived and the service was amazing. I tried the Mickey waffle, but the French Toast there puts it to shame. We also ate at Teppan Edo twice during our visit to Epcot. It was a fun Japanese steakhouse and we loved eating community style and the show the cooks do. Italian restaurant at Epcot was also very good. 9 Dragons at Epcot was good, but probably our least favorite in that particular park. To each his/her own. They had extremely fast service at 9 dragons, but we almost as if they were rushing us to eat and get out. Sci-Fi Restaurant at Disney's Hollywood Studios was fun. We always try to go there while at Disney. You eat in convertibles and the atmosphere is like an old drive-in movie theater. Shopping: We went via taxi (they sit at the GF door) and went to the Prime Outlets. So many stores and lots of fun for a few hours. GF also has a neat soap store, a golf store, and a fun shop on the first floor that offers cute clothing for women (think Lilly dresses, different Minnie Mouse shirts, bathing suits.) The parks also have Disney themed stores and will deliver your items to your resort at no charge so you don't have to drag them around the park. Allow at least 1 day for delievery. There is also a convenient shop in the GF that has snacks, books, Christmas ornaments now, Disney mugs, etc. Monorail: Easy to catch on the 2nd floor of the GF main building. We never had huge waiting lines. The cars were crammed at times, standing room only, but that wasn't an issue since it doesn't take long at all for you to get to whatever park you are visiting. Note- you have to switch monorails (very easy) to get to Epcot and no monorails go to the Animal Kingdom, Downtown Disney, or Hollywood Studios. You have to go to those parks via bus, but they have a very convenient schedule, were clean and comfortable enough. Parks: All amazing! Take advantage of the fastpass service. You get a ticket that allows you to come back during a certain time frame to be in a shorter line for the most popular rides. Also, we were very happy with the Photopass service. Instead of annoying other guests with \"can you take our picture,\" there are many Disney photogs around to do that. They also have fun props at certain locations that make pictures more interesting and are easy to view online. Decent prices too. If you do go with the Photopass, I would recommend buying the package where you get a cd prior to getting to Disney. You save a lot that way if you are a picture person. Special events: We attended Mickeys Very Christmas Party and had a blast! The Magic Kingdom shuts down except for guests who have tickets (must buy in addition to regular park ticket.) The castle was completely transformed and gorgeous, there is an incredible parade, cookies and hot chocolate are passed out in various locations and the characters do a special show in front of Cinderella's Castle. Allergies: Forgot to note in the food section that Disney does an incredible job catering to allergies. At the restaurants, they asked if we had any allergies and when we told them our issues, they were totally accomodating. The managers of the restaurants came out and talked to us as we were ordering at each place, just to be safe. I appreciated that. Also, I was impressed at the Mickey's Christmas Party that they offered gluten free cookies and a substitute to the hot chocolate. Spa: I thought we would have time to take advantage of the GF spa, but we honestly were having too much fun in the parks our relaxing in our room. Weddings: The GF is right at the Wedding Pavilion and we witnessed a few seconds of 2 gorgeous weddings. The couples looked very happy. We have stayed at some of the most amazing places in the world, so when our friends who haven't stayed at Disney heard we were going they thought we were crazy. We have been home for a little over a week now and keep talking about how hard it was to leave and how much fun we had. I get sad talking about it cause I want to be back there. It was truly magical. Yes, it will be so much fun and a different experience once we have children and take them there, but it allowed us, as a couple to relax and just be kids again. Disney World truly has something for all ages. I know I am forgetting some details as it is late when I am typing this review, but please feel free to send me a message if you have any questions. I've also stayed at other Disney resorts and am happy to give you my opinions of those. I guess I should start posting about those experiences. I would recommend the Grand Floridian to the traveler who is looking for the most upscale Walt Disney World property. The whole property was just beautiful and the Disney cast members were incredible. The resort never felt \"stuffy\" although I personally think that it has the most elegant decor. You could still let loose and relax there. A few more highlights: The gingerbread house in the GF main lobby looks, smells and tastes amazing! They sell cookies from the house from 10 am - 10 pm (I think) in season. Also, the orchestra that plays in the evening was lovely. GF had a nice beach and 2 pools. We were busy with other things and didn't use them, but they looked great. Last tips: I can't tell you how many disgruntled parents and out of control kids/temper-tantrums we witnessed. We don't have children yet, but please give your kids a nap in the day if they tend to get grumpy. Also, expect lines. You are at Disney World and they are pretty efficient at getting you to a seat fairly quickly. The fastpass is genius. Make reservations at Cinderella's Table 180 plus days in advance if you can. It is nearly impossible to get in there if you don't, even with concierge service. For other restaurants reservations are recommended, but we found that we could walk up and wait 20-30 minutes for a table, which we didn't mind. We didn't want to have to plan our day around reservations, so it worked out nicely.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newjersey", "Title": "\u201cSERVICE AND LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "gumbatony", "ReviewID": "UR49505265", "Content": "Stayed from 11/1 t 11/6.

Perfect view, no crowds, and a 24 hour restaurant right behind you. Best seat in the house since crowds getting out of the park are crazy.

It is my favorite for a variety of reasons. Location, Location, Location comes first to mind, especially the ease of wheeling your stroller right on the monorail and being at MK in five minutes. I also love the feel of the rooms with their light colored decor and the size. We love to stay in Boca Chica (although it took three room changes to get there...) and have a pool view. The restaurants are pricey but great. Narcoosees was surprisingly good and the view was great. The pools are ok (Yacht club better) but the view onto Bay Lake is wonderful. A nice perk.... we finally got to Boca Chica and on our last night stepped out back to watch the fireworks at the Magic Kingdon--perfect. You can't ask for much more than that. I also loved the convenience of Gasparilla Grill for breakfast and late night snacks (I think it is open 24 hours--I don't think any other hotel has this). Kind of hard to find, though and we missed it on our first stay. The only things I thought about on my most recent stay that lacked a bit was the service and make this hotel a four star instead of a five star. Most importanly, turn down was drive by: this is unacceptable as the room rates are based on paying for this. We would get ---\"here are your towels\" if we were in our room, and not ask if we wanted turn down. Yes, we probably should have said we wanted turn down, but I felt uncomfortable. We were checked into a room on the first floor next to an elevator which I asked to be switched (we had a light sleeping baby) and they complied, but put us in a dormer room, which I did not like. They eventually switched us to a room that was perfect, but it took two days. I have to say that they did try to switch us before but claimed no room. I feel that when I return to a hotel for a week every year and spend a lot of money in the restaurants at the hotel, they should recognize repeat customers as such, but I don' t feel that happens in the Disney machine. Also, I always read about people receiving upgrades, but in my 8 or so trips this has never happened. Service at the bar outside of Citricos was also weird: a woman who claimed she worked at the bar (which was closed at the time we were there) made excuses about how she normally did not work there and grumbled a lot, but, hey, we still enjoyed it, but again, not 5 star stuff. In totality, though, all this is probably minor stuff. To temper these complaints, they did change my room to make me happy, and, when I lost my daughter's favorite bear at Animal Kingdom Lodge, they went above and beyond to get it back and Fedex it to me. Also, we love the bar at the hotel (closed at the time we were their, though)--it is so awesome with the musicians outside playing every night and the music in the lobby (there is also a piano player most nights). You really feel you are in a special place.

The hotel itself was very pretty in a Victorian way. The pools were lovely. The staff there was wonderful especially the front desk clerk who gave us a room in Boca Chica with a spectacular view of the Magic Kingdom and the Contemporary even though we hadn't reserved a Magic Kingdom room. We could even see the fireworks from our balcony. The room was kept very clean daily and our 10 and 8 year old girls especially loved the hand-towels shaped into ducks. The location was especially convenient and we took the monorail often. Our girls loved riding up front with the monorail driver who gave them their own personal monorail licenses. The buses didn't run as smoothly as the monorail system and one morning after waiting over half an hour for a bus to the Animal Kingdom, we finally gave up and took a cab.

From the first step off the Floridian Bus from the airport and being greeted by our personal greeter who knew our names and our occasion, we were instantly impressed. She pleasantly described the amenities of the hotel and where everything was while casually escorting us to our room. Once at our room, she opened the door and pointed everything out in the room and then opened the curtain to expose of lake view of the Castle in the Magic Kingdom. She left us with a great impression of the staff and the resort in general. After she exited the room we took a seat on our balcony first thing to enjoy our view and soak in the experience after the flight from Boston. It's was then we noticed that from certain areas of our balcony, the view was obstructed by a rather large and leafy tree. Figuring we had nothing to lose, and the greeter did ask us if the room was acceptable and offered to check on other rooms if we weren't 100% happy before she left., we went to see the concierge. We had chosen to stay on the concierge level, so they were immediately available just a hallway away from our room. We had a seat and explained our concerns of the tree. Without having to say another word, our concierge immediately offered she look for compatible room availability and give us a tour of those rooms to make a new choice. It turned out, it was as simple as moving us two rooms down to a more center room with a perfect view of the Castle. She took care of all the details while we toured the grounds and when we came back an hour or so latter, we simply stopped by her desk for our new room keys. It was a easy as that. The personal tour, opposed to listening to her list available rooms from her computer screen made such a difference. From there, things just continued to get better and better. They Knew were we're celebrating our honeymoon, and when we came back to the room that first evening, we were greeting inside the room by balloons, Disney Photos, Champagne on ice with 2 glasses, a fresh rose, and special Customized Just Married Buttons which we wore our whole stay! If anyone has stayed on the concierge level in the main building. I know you've met at least half of the staff. Dan, Vonnie, MeJay, and Mr. Hardy are the staff we meet the most. From the honeymoon suite, we needed to pass by their desk to get to the elevator for the main lobby. Not a time would go by where whoever was working didn't stop for a minute and ask us about our day. A simple \"good morning\" easily turned into a several minute conversation. And that there was always 2 concierge working, you got unrushed, individual attention. By the end of our stay we felt like we were saying goodbye to friends. You could tell they truly wanted us to enjoy our stay and made it clear they would do anything in their power to accomplish that. After the treatment received on the concierge level, I'm afraid we are spoiled from making reservations any other way.

It was wonderful to be able to step out onto our balcony and see Cinderella Castle and Bay Lake. The room was what we expected. It definitely wasn't huge, but had plenty of space for us.

I drove up from West Palm Beach where we had spent several days at the Breakers (beautiful 5 star historic ocean front hotel) The price of the Grand Floridian was the same as the Breakers ocean front room - around $400/night for a concierge room which I booked through Oribitz and was a solid discount from what Disney had priced on their site. Rate included continental breakfast and snacks during the day (all of this was mediocre). I had high expectations of this hotel - espcially after staying in the past at the Disney Animal Kingdom hotel. When I walked into my ground floor Sugar Loaf (building) room I was shocked at how cramped and dark the room was - first impression was a big let down. This was not a 5 star or even 4 star room. Tiny bathroom and there was barely space for 2 adults to walk around - let alone kids. I asked to be moved to a higher floor since there was a lot of building work being done on the the lower floors. The higher room was a little better - espeically with the extra room without the sofa/daybed, but still not worth the money. Also - you can hear noise from the rooms next door - down to the sneezing. Pools were just okay -- the pool by the \"beach\" was not as cool as we thought it would be - the slide was geared for age 6 or under. My 9 year old didn't find it too fun. I stay in hotels around 50+ nights a year for work -most are 5 star. I don't care how close the hotel is to the magic kingdom - the room itself is only worth around $275/night tops. No wonder they were only at 40% occupancy - down 50% from the prior year. The room and hotel were clean and service was good - my daughter left behind her bear (we realized at the airport) and they found it and mailed it free of charge to us (thank you Disney!). However, in general at the parks and the hotel things just didn't feel quite as magical from a service experience as they have in past years. The only way I would even suggest this hotel is if your rate is under $280 and if you have a child under 5 that needs to nap during the day and would enjoy the pool areas. The closeness to the parks would be a benefit to this -- although some of the lower priced disney resorts might be a better value. I do recommend their Victoria and Alberts restaurant ($125/person - regardless of age - although kids are suppose to be 12 or older) 6 course menu.

I had to force my boys and husband to try to the Grand Floridian because they always thought the Polynesian was great. This was our first stay at the Grand Floridian, and in my mind at least, it's replaced the Polynesian as my favorite Disney property. The theming is very nice, but do know that this theming is supposed to be sophisticated Victorian Florida resort. If you don't want that, this one is not for you. We did not find it to be stuffy at all. We booked a standard garden view room and were upgraded to lagoon view in the Big Pine Key building. However, we had to be relocated after five nights because there was an increasingly leaky pipe in the wall which caused the bathroom floor to be sopping wet. We were impressed with how the management handled this situation. They called my cell when we were at dinner, and then when we went to the front desk and talked to a confused clerk who could not find our reservation (because we'd already been moved out of the room number we told her we were in!), a manager magically appeared behind us, had new keys already made for us, and had upgraded us to a theme park view extra large corner room in Boca Chica. We could see the Magic Kingdom from our two balconies, and we could even hear the train whistle and music from Main Street. It's truly a magical location. I do believe the resort needs to maintain its plumbing better so that there are not future floods in this way, but at the same time, they were professional and prompt in handling us when we were obviously inconvenienced. Others have posted about construction. We did see work being done, but we did not find it disruptive at all. The inconvenience would depend upon your room's location. They're putting new tile in the main building, and the completed portions are beautiful, though there were screens up requiring us to walk around certain areas on the second floor. I'm also assuming the construction will be done soon because they're not adding any buildings, just working on the stairwells and roofs in the existing ones. We had dinner at Citricos and Narcoossee's (both very good), breakfast at Grand Floridian Cafe (good), and several meals at Gasparilla's, the quick service place. Really, Gasparilla's is not the best quick service. They should remove those ridiculous arcade games to provide more seating and a quieter atmosphere, and improve the quality of the food which is not quite as good as Captain Cook's next door at the Polynesian (and that's not all that great either!). Pools are nice, though the waterslide, according to my kids, is not as good as the Poly's. The Grand Floridian pools are not overly crowded, however, and we could always easily get pool chairs, unlike at the Polynesian where I felt like the pool was much too crowded for the size of the resort. Grounds are lush and beautiful and also peaceful. Castmembers were all very helpful and treat guests better than the castmembers at the Polynesian do overall. We dealt with bell services, food service, front desk, and management--and all were great. This is the only Disney resort with standard turndown service, and my kids really liked that. The rooms are bright and cheery and have excellent lighting in the bathrooms. Also, housekeeping provides lots of towels and toiletries, too. Of course, it's overpriced for the room and service, and I know we could get better price options off site, but part of what you're paying for here is location.

Naturally I dashed inside, taking with me any hopes of sitting on our balcony. The banging and crashing soon started. We decided to go into the park and then complain later on the day. We came back to our room around lunchtime, for showers and to go for a swim. My mother had a shower and walked out into her room to be met by a workman on her balcony painting!! I looked on to our balcony and yes, we had a workman there too. Together with one on a cherry picker, and of course the crashing and banging. My husband complained and we were offered two new rooms, which were a huge inconvenience as we then had to pack everything up and wait around all afternoon for the rooms, ruining what was left of my birthday. My husband then demanded he spoke to the manager, after 2 hours we finally spoke him and he was very pleasant and we were given a night free for both rooms and a bottle of wine. He explained that everyone in the hotel had been written to, to say the work was going on and he was sorry we were not warned. The work was not confined to the rooms.

The building is beautiful, and we were able to watch fireworks from the balcony of our room every night (we could see the top part of the castle from the balcony) It was nice to take a boat over to Magic Kingdom, and made it easy to get back to our room with 4 small kids after a hot day in the park. We ended up spending most of our time at the resort, and saving our park tickets for our next visit (we got the non-expiration tickets). The kids loved the pool and the waterslide was great. There were fun games by the pool on some days, and the kids (ages 7, 6, 6, and 2) all enjoyed it. The zero-entry made it easy for our youngest to walk just as far as she wanted before the water got too deep. Plan to spend a lot on food! The gift shops in the resort are really nice too, but pricey. The cafe was nice, and fun but a little too expensive for what you get- I'd recommend getting food from the quick service place with the video games, so you can sit and watch the fireworks while you eat at a good price. The other restaurants booked up fast, and the cinderella buffet was fun- but also VERY expensive for us. The beach was nice, but disappointed not to be able to go in the water. Probably won't be able to afford this resort again unless we get a good offer- we did the buy 4 nights get 3 free deal, and picked a good time to go. Very hot, and the rain in the afternoon shut down the pools for a couple hours each day, which gave us some time to clean up. Housekeeping was great. Nice clean room every time we came back from the pool- fresh soaps and towels constantly, and the beds were always made up and everything re-cleaned every night we came back from dinner. The kids didn't want to leave. For the view of the fireworks I would definitely recommend this resort. Especially if you plan to visit magic kingdom or epcot- the monorail goes right from the resort to the parks. The bus takes you to the other parks and takes a while- but then again that's disney world- every park is far from every other park (which is why the park hopper is not worth the trouble). We used self parking, which meant we had to pull up to some slightly pushy people trying to get us to use valet (10 dollars a day). And we ended up unloading our own bags and were a little unsure of where to go- we couldn't check in til 3. The only bad thing is that the self parking is SO far away! But I was happy to not have the hastle of getting a valet driver each time I needed something from the van! Very nice resort. Bring nice clothes to dress up for dinners if you plan to visit the restaurants. And some extra money for spa treatments- if we come back to this resort I am definitely taking advantage of some of the spa treatments!", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Disney World, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGrand in name only\u201d", "Author": "AGentlRose", "ReviewID": "UR37103890", "Content": "We've spent our last Disney vacations at the Polynesian but decided to give the Grand Floridian a try for a change. We stayed club level, which we paid for, not freely upgraded, so my review is based on that. If we were given the upgrade to concierge for free like others were, I'm sure my views would be a bit more slanted. I was told by the Concierge at the Grand Floridian to let them know my approximate arrival time and someone would be there waiting to meet us when we got off the Magical Express and that in any case, the club level check in podium would be down the walkway near the parking valet/bell stand. We got of the bus, no concierge cast member, no podium for club level checkin either. So we walked into the hotel, and the greeter, a very sweet older man, asked if he could help us. I told him we were club level guests and that someone from the concierge team was supposed to meet us and he went to look for the person. We just stood and waited in the lobby, until finally our concierge CM came and said that she was sorry she didn't meet our bus, but that they were \"extremely busy.\" Okay, I can accept that. She walked us to our room, which did not meet either of my two requests --- king bed (told me they were reserved for wedding couples), not ground floor (room was on the ground floor). I told her that I understand that requests are just requests and not guaranteed, but if I can't have a king bed, then at least give us a room that is not exactly in front of the 24-hour open main pool. So they switched us to a second floor room, with two queen beds facing the marina --- at least it was quiet. Concierge level does have some nice perks, but are they worth the cost? It's up to you to decide. We did use the club level lounge for coffee and bagels in the morning, and if we were there around 5 PM, when they put out appetizers, (cheese, crackers, chicken pot stickers, cupcakes, brownies, veggies) we would take something to tide us over till dinner. We don't drink, but if someone likes their beer and wine, it is free flowing during serving hours and you are welcome to take bottles of beer or glasses of wine to your room. We were at the parks in the afternoon, so we never had afternoon tea with cookies, scones, etc. or evening cordials and desserts either. We were at Disney to enjoy the Disney parks, not sit in the hotel. We didn't use the concierge for dining reservations, as I do my planning myself, but I do understand that sometimes, they are able to get coveted, hard to get reservations that an ordinary guest cannot. And there is a small refrigerator with soft drinks that are available 24 hours a day. They have an espresso /cappuccino /latte machine, that you could get with steamed or foam milk. I did have a latter and it was pretty good. The cast members who worked in the concierge lounge were the best, they were pleasant, and we had some great conversations to several of them. Housekeeping was superb, the room was also cleaned in a timely manner, and they always left plenty of toiletries and towels, no skimping there. Every night, there was turndown service, with chocolates and \"sweet dreams\" notes left on each bed, and towels were replaced and new toiletries were left if needed. I have no complaints about the hotel, although I think that since guests who stay at the Grand Floridian do pay a premium, when it comes to transportation, they get the worst service. It is the last stop on the bus lines to Animal Kingdom, the Studios and Downtown Disney, so it is standing room only by the time the bus gets to the Grand Floridian. I do think that the cast members who work in the shops and quick service restaurants at the Polynesian seemed much happier than those working at the Grand Floridian, and the Poly just seemed to be a more welcoming place. I had reservations for a return to the Grand in Nov./Dec, however, my husband felt as I did, that the Poly was just more like home for us, and I switched our reservations to the Poly. Note about self parking: It is free but it is across the road from the hotel. A long walk when you are tired from being in the parks all day. (valet is $10 per day unless you have a disabled placard, then it is free) I didn't rate the rooms very high because for the price paid, they were kind of small. However, the rooms were well maintained and very clean. WiFi internet instead of wired would be nice considered this is Disney's top of the line hotel, not to mention that Disney charges you $9.95 per 24 hours continuous usage. Final take: Grand Floridian is a nice place to try --- once, but I wouldn't do it again. As I heard two older couples on the monorail talking about their experience with different Disney hotels and the Grand Floridian, his exact words \"nothing grand about it, except the price.\"", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deirdre Dickson", "Title": "\u201cWorth every cent\u201d", "Author": "JambaMarie", "ReviewID": "UR36733379", "Content": "My husband and I got off the Disney magical express to be greeted by a Grand Floridian cast member who walked us directly to our room (in the sugar loaf building).

Some deem it as expensive but I will say the guests are different in comparison to what we seen in other areas.

We visited the Grand because we have vacation club points and it was an easy stop over on our way up the FL state. Having stayed at many of the Disney resorts, when we visit Disney again, we will not be staying at the Grand. We feel that Disney has many other resorts to offer. When you pull into the Grand you have a choice to self park or valet. You are almost forced to valet your car, for $10 a day plus tip, because the self parking lot is across the street. If you valet, the bellmen will help you bring your luggage to your room. Anytime you need something from your car, or want to leave the resort you must get your car from the valet. To us, this is very inconvenient. There are several buildings at the Grand, which makes it a very busy place. We were in an outer building on the second floor. Our building sat on the lake. The room was clean and kept up, but you could hear everything that was going on in the room next door. The rooms have a small fridge and coffee maker. There are several restaurants at the grand. Many are casual dress, but there are a couple that do require jackets, for men. We ate at the Cafe for breakfast which was pricey but delicious. I suggest that you make reservations for all of your meals there because there were always people waiting. We waited at least 30 minutes to be seated for breakfast. We also ate at Gasparilla Grill, which is cafeteria style. The food here was average priced, but not that great. On Friday night we were able to catch the fireworks from the resort. Since the resort sits on the lake, you could see them clearly from the marina. The beach at the Grand, but it is small and you cannot go into the water. There are several pools that are big enough to accommodate all of the families staying on the resort. One day, we rented a boat to cruise around the lake. This was pricey but it was something to do. We did not visit any of the parks while staying, because we have been to them many times before. We did however visit The Boardwalk and Downtown Disney. It took forever to get to Downtown Disney and The Boardwalk from the Grand. Before you plan your vacation to Disney, I suggest you look at the resorts' locations in relation to the parks you plan to visit. You want to pick a resort that is closest to where you visit, so that you are not wasting your time riding the buses, ferries, or monorail. Do your research before going.

It was 97 degrees and very humid so I applaud them for keeping their happy faces on. I cant state enough how much I love dropping my bags off at the airport and not dealing with them again till they appear in my room! And its very nice for us not to deal with renting a car or finding transportation to the resorts. The buses are comfortable, air conditioned, and we have never waited more than 3 minutes for to be boarded. Upon arrival, we were greeted at the front entrance by a nice man who escorted us right to the check in desk. Even though it was hours before check in time, our room was ready. This time we had a room in the Boca Chica buiding which is directly across from the main building and the pool. We had reserved a garden view room and what a great view it was! Looking directy on to the pool and the main building with side views of the lagoon was truly beautiful. Out the back of our building had front row views of the fireworks and the lit Cinderella's castle, Space Mountain, The Contemporary, and all the boats on the water. The room itself is bright and clean with the best beds of any hotel I have ever stayed. Housekeeping was wonderful, what a treat to have our beds turned down every night , chocolate on our pillows, and towel-made Mickeys. Another nice suprise, my birthday fell one day after we were leaving but I still received a white chocolate Mickey with truffles (yum!) , a card from Mickey, and a gift card for a 20% discount on my photopass pictures. We ate in all the restaurant that the GF has to offer. Citricos and Narcoossee's were the two best meals I have ever eaten in Disney. 1900 Park Fare is hard to get into, Cinderella & her stepsisters appear here, reservations are full for weeks in advance, but we walked up to the desk and were able to get in easily. The food is buffet style and okay but the show put on by the stepsisters as they walk around and pose for pictures is hysterical. Cinderella and Prince Charming also dance with a few kids. Another great meal at Disney, though REALLY expensive, was the California Grill on top of the Contemporary. What a view!! From that height you can see the whole park and the surrounding hotels. Food was delicious and a large wine selection but not really a place for young children. Transportation from the GF is very easy. You can get to MK by boat or monorail and the buses to all other attractions were very fast during this trip.

This was our first time staying at the GF. The only reason I decided to stay at Disney's most expensive resort is because of the 4nights/3 free special that they were offering. Even with the 3 nights lodging free, it still cost us an exorbitant fee for this trip. We were celebrating my 41st birthday here. To be as brief as possible, we were greeted immediately by a very friendly hostess as soon as we disembarked from Disney's Magical Express in front of the hotel. We were whisked away to our building, which was the Sugar Loaf concierge bldg. adjacent to the main one. We ended up being upgraded for free to concierge level by Disney, thus entitling us to some small food offerings throughout the day. Our rooms were two adjoining ones and they were very pleasantly appointed. Please keep in mind that, being that this is touted as being Disney's very FINEST hotel, I was expecting a touch of opulence. I was somewhat disappointed to find that, even though this hotel is beautiful and lovely, I would not characterize it as high-end. Marketing ploys lead one to believe that they will be experiencing an upscale, exquisite hotel -- however this is not entirely true. It is a very nice hotel indeed, but I do not feel it really and truly lived up to my expectations based on the reviews and the belief that this was the finest Disney had to offer. Nice rooms and lovely surroundings are certainly what you get -- but you are not getting even 4 star hotel status in my honest opinion. Here in NH we have a hotel up in the White Mountains called the Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods, NH. It is considered to be only a 4 diamond AAA hotel and it was far more magnificent in all aspects when compared to the Grand Floridian. So I rate the Grand Floridian as being beautiful, pleasant, comfortable, lovely, etc. but I wil readily say it was not even close to what it is purported to be. Also worthy of mentioning is that the concierge buffet offerings are not that palatable. On the very first morning, there were tiny black fruit flies covering the fruit offerings. It was truly disgusting a sight to behold, and it so turned me off that I refused to eat any fruit for the entire trip. I even discouraged my children from doing so as well for fear of what those squalid flies would transmit. I have not even seen this type of bug infestation in Hampton Inns, let alone finding that at Disney's Grand Dame. Also, the food was the same basically every single day. I am not complaining loudly as this was free for us as an upgrade, however I do mention it for those poor souls who are actually paying beaucoup bucks for this spread -- it is not worth paying for. Especially when there are flies all over the open food. One has to wonder how sanitary it is after all. The other thing for those of you who like internet access for email, news, etc. You are required to pay $10 per day access fee! I feel that is exceptionally high and I am by no means any tight wad. And the real kicker is that you need to pay $10 to access the internet in your room and then another $10 per day to access the web at the pool/lobby area. It was nice to have the all-night cafe Gasparilla Games for our teenage boys to go grab food and play games at all odd hours of the night. The pools on the property are quite lovely, as one would expect. The boat ride from the GF to the Magic Kingdom is alot of fun and a refreshing respite on those hot days. We rented the little Sea Raycer boats from the GF dock out back. Our family rented 4 of them for 1 1/2 hrs. utilizing the coupon that is provided in your welcome package. Boy, was that one of the highlights of our trip! We really really had a blast on those things! If I could recommend one must-do, it would definitely be to try these boats - a ton of fun. Last thing I want to mention is that housekeeping was mediocre at best, which came as a bit of a shock to me. We were lucky to get very minor straightening services once every two days. There was even one day where the housekeeping staff didn't even empty our trash! I was peeved to say the least, coming home from a long day of touring to find the room smelling of trash. We also found a few days where the beds had not even been made or the room straightened up. I found that to be really odd. I've never stayed in a hotel in all my years where housekeeping did not even come in the room to do minor bedmaking/trash emptying. I did not even bother to say anything to anyone, but I will say that when I go back to Disney World, I will not stay at the Grand Floridian again. We stayed last year at the AKL in a sprawing 2 bdrm. suite that was literally right on the savannah with the animals a stone's throw from our windows. I would rate the AKL as being a higher class hotel than the GF.

I have stayed at many Disney Resorts, from the all star movies to the polynesian, and I have to say that not only is the Grand Floridian my favourite hotel at Disney World it is one of my favourite hotels in the world! I just love the experience you get from staying at this hotel. The staff are always very pleasant, and always happy to answer any question you may have. Housekeeping was also very efficient, happy to come early while we were at the parks, as we would usually have a midday rest stop to relax in our room, before heading back out to the parks later in the afternoon. Our room was beautiful, we were upgraded from a normal garden view room (which was all we could get at the time we booked) to a Magic Kingdom view room. We had a great view of the castle and the fireworks. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. In regards to food we ate at 1900 Park Fare for both breakfast and dinner, and found the buffets to have a wide variety of good food. Then at Narcoossee's we had a great view of the fireworks, and I believe this restaurant to be one of the best seafood restaurants at Disney World, great food!!! The at the Grand Floridian Cafe we had light meal which was again very nice, with a good selection and not too expensive. Another good thing about the Grand Floridian is its location!!! The monorail goes straight to the Magic Kingdom with no stops, however of the way back it stops off at the Contempory, then the polynesian, then the Grand Floridian, so I recommend you take advantage of the boat service on the way back from the Magic Kingdom back to the hotel. The monorail also goes from the Grand Floridian to the TTC (Transport & Tocket Center) so you can then get on a monorail to Epcot. So the only two parks you have to worry about buses for are Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. Although the buses are very reliable and if you miss one, you dont have to wait long before another one comes along which is very handy!

Everything about the Grand Floridian was excellent. Is it expensive, well of course it is, this hotel is the Flag Ship hotel of all the Disney resorts. All the staff was very friendly and you could tell that the staff would make attempts to go the extra mile if need be. The rooms were super clean, the bedding always seemed as if it was brand new linen. We had booked a castle view room. I must say for all that have little ones this was a great option that we took. I know it cost more to stay at, but there was many nights with children under 3 that we were back in our room before fireworks. The little ones loved sitting out on the balconies with us to watch the fireworks. Make sure if you do request a castle view, that it is not an ubstructed castle view, for there is trees in front of some of the rooms blocking the castle. The pools were beautiful and they even have a pool area for the little ones by there beach. The beach is small at the Floridian, but I don't know, when we do Disney I'm not there to sit at a beach. We took a walk over to the Polynesian and I will say it had a LOT more children at that resort. We think next year we will book there to see what we like better. Overall it was a great hotel, definately get the meal plan and do the character breakfasts. Remember you must book a lot of your reservations 3 months in advance for character meals in order to have availability. Otherwise if there is availability the times are much later.

We took advantage of Disney's Magical Express transportation, which I found very convenient and an added value to our vacation. Once we arrived at the resort, a lovely woman dressed in a Victorian costume greeted us and advised us that we had been upgraded to a concierge pool view room. She walked us to our room pointing out the location of the pools and restaurants. The lobby and the grounds are immaculate. We finished the check-in process in our room; a very nice touch. I was very impressed with the room - it had updated Victorian decor with two, plush queen beds, day bed, a generous balcony with bistro set overlooking the pool, as well as a flat screen TV and fridge for beverages. I was also impressed with the bath products - H20 Spa products and robes. They had peppermint foot lotion, which was fantastic after a long day at the parks. During our stay, Florida was experiencing monsoon-like downpours . Despite the weather, the property was beautifully maintained. As you walked the grounds, you could enjoy the serene setting and take in the sweet smell of fresh roses. Due to the weather, we only enjoyed the pool one evening. It was very clean and not crowded. I think that it is fantastic that the pools are open 24-hours. Each morning before heading out to the parks, we would go downstairs to the concierge lounge where they offered a continental breakfast. This included toast, bagels, pastries, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, juice and coffee. I loved their coffee machine - it made cappuccino's, latte's, espresso's to enjoy in the lounge or on the go. The concierge lounge offered light snacks throughout the day, an afternoon tea, evening h'orduerves with wine and beer and evening deserts and aperitifs. We found the concierge to be very helpful. We had booked several restaurant reservations before we arrived, but we were unable to book The California Grill because they were all booked up. The concierge was able to get us our much sought after reservations during the fireworks display! It was fantastic - I would recommend it! The concierge also helped us to book massages at the spa, borrow videos on a rainy afternoon and address any of our concerns. They were spectacular! The hotel has several beautiful restaurants that you should definitely try. We visited Narcoosee's, Citrico's and Victoria and Alberts. Narcoosee's overlooks the lagoon and offers beautiful views of the Magic Kingdom Fireworks. There was a substantial wait regardless of the reservations. Once seated, the atmosphere was resort casual. I had the most incredible raspberry mojito and key lime creme brulee. My complaint with this restaurant is that they do not enforce their dress code. When you call for reservations - they point out multiple times that the dress attire is business casual (ie: no shorts, sneakers, jeans, etc) When you get there, at least half of the patrons are wearing shorts, jean cut-offs and sneakers. This affects the restaurants ambiance and perhaps if they upheld their dress code, the wait would not be an hour and a half. Citricos offers Mediterranean and Tuscan inspired cuisine. You can also enjoy partial views of the Magic Kingdom Fireworks. The food was very good, but I was not impressed with the cocktails. Victoria and Alberts was an experience not to be missed. The restaurant is very intimate with seating for approximately 10 couples. We had a fantastic pair taking care of us. They did an impeccable job of explaining the courses and really made you feel at home. The dinner consisted of 8 courses paired with a beautiful selection of wines. There was not one course that I did not love. The attention to detail at this restaurant is second to none with customized menus, attentive staff, romantic ambiance and a harpist. My compliments to the chef and all of the staff at this establishment. By far the most amazing meal of my life. At the end of the meal, they sent us home with a homemade loaf of bread to enjoy for breakfast the next day. This may be an expensive option, but the experience is worth it. My husband and I do not have children and one of our concerns when vacationing to destinations such as Disney World is: will we be surrounded with yelling, screaming, obnoxious 5-year olds. This is not to be a concern at this resort. The atmosphere is relaxed and elegant. The children were all very well behaved.

We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon and check in could not have been easier. I simply asked if they had any available upgraded views instead of our standard garden view. The cast member said that she would go and check. She then came back and said that she could put us into a conciege level room!!! We were amazed that she would offer us this room. We were then taken up to our room and given a brief tour of the resort by a very nice bell man. Every morning, the continental breakfast was put out at exactly 7am and was your basic breakfast foods, cereals, breads, bagels, and fresh fruit. There were misc. snacks put out from 10-5 and then hors derves put out from 5-7pm. These were usually different every night, but always very tasty!! We even skipped dinner one night and just ate there!! The pools were nice and never too crowded. The service at the pool bar was excellent and there were always plenty of clean towels at the pool. We took advantage of their marina and took out one of their little two person boats to go out into the 7 Seas Lagoon, which was fun. Now, this was the first time that we stayed at a property that had the monorail and god was it convenient! Im not sure that we will be able to stay anywhere that doesnt have the monorail from here on out! Only negative that I can mention was 1900 Park Fare, pretty dissappointing. The food was well below average both in selection and quality, even for buffet food. Now, it was just my wife and me (she really wanted to see Cinderella!), but there were some famalies that were going to have to wait over 1 hour and 45 minutes to see all of the characters at dinner. We finally left after 90 minutes and saw just Cinderella and Prince Charming. Now obviously we have a different outlook on the resort after being upgraded, but the entire staff was tremendous. People had no idea that we were staying on the concierge level except for the cast members that worked up there, but every single customer service person that we ran into, offered to help in anyway they can. From housekeeping to the bellmen, to the front desk staff, the Grand Floridian does it first class all the way.

I cannot say the same for the Grand Floridian. From the moment we checked in we had issues. We asked for an upgrade that we were willing to pay for but they didn't have anything and it still took over half an hour to check us into our rooms that were not ready for hours after! I was expecting a package of medicine and diapers for my kids that they never bothered to tell me arrived and when I asked for them to send it up, they said it would take at least an hour...at 10:00 at night. My husband offered to get it himself and they said instead they would send it up right away...it didn't arrive till nearly 11. I couldn't change my son and put him to bed and my daughter was burning up with fever thanks to the hotel staff. Another day we asked if they could directly connect us to Narcooses as the dining button on our phone was broken, they said they could not and instead suggested we take a walk over there ourselves in the pouring rain, flooding and lightning. On our final day I had a standoff with a housekeeper who basically told me he was horrified with the condition of my room and proceeded to chastise me in front of my children. Incredible!!! This was a splurge for us that we planned months in advance, expecting the best. In my opinion we got the worst. When I complained to management I was met with indifference. I travel very often, staying at everything from Holiday Inns to Ritz Carltons and have never experienced anything quite like this. There is no chance that I would ever stay at the Grand Floridian again. Nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.

In addition to just going to WDW, we bought passes for two nights of Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party, and on top of that we invited one of the grandmothers to tag along. We have gone 3 years in a row during the summer, but skipped this summer since we were already secretly planning the December trip. During our previous visits we have stayed at Disney's moderate and economy resorts and have had wonderful trips! We vascillated on where to stay this time: economy because of the added cost of an additional person plus the MVMCP; Contemporary/Polynesian/Grand Floridian because of the monorail and the number of times we would be going to the MK and Epcot. Once we decided we would be staying near MK at a deluxe resort, I started reading every review I could find on the Internet, especially the reviews on this site. WE SETTLED ON THE GRAND FLORIDIAN. To be totally honest, I did not know what to think about the Grand Floridian because of all of the reviews that seemed to contradict each other - - you know what I mean - - just read the ones posted here the past few days. Further more, I still don't know what to think because I have read the reviews since returning from the trip, and they are still contradictory. All I can do is tell you about my family's trip. We had a wonderful time at the resort beginning with a late night arrival. The check-in was smooth, a bell hop drove us to our building. He insisted that the birthday girl sit up front with him and even gave her a Happy Birthday balloon! On the way to our room, he gave us a whole lot of information about the resort and WDW; all of which was very helpful! Once we got to our building, he brought the bags to the room, got us ice, turned down the hide-a-bed for our daughter and asked if there was anything else he could do for us - - so far so good! Over the course of our stay, housekeeping did a fine job. They turned the beds down each night and left chocolates on the pillows. They even made little characters out of towels and washcloths for our daughter and left her a really neat balloon contraption in the room on her birthday! Many of the reviews stated that the rooms were not dusted and the bathrooms (toilet/shower area) were not well-kept. Also, there were several postings about having to take a cold shower. I would agree that the room was not clean as other hotels I have stayed, and I did have a cold shower one day (luckily the ladies in my family all had hot showers all the time) but I chose to not those things ruin my trip. In fact, I did not even discuss these issues with my wife until we got home since the trip was about having fun, not trying to find things to complain about. We found the room to be large enough for 3 adults and 1 child. Having a large vanity with 2 sinks separate from the shower/toilet was a plus. Both of these features (room size with hide-a-bed, 2 sinks, separate bathroom) were all reasons we booked the GF. In addition to the reviews of the rooms, others have stated their disappointment with Gasparilla's. I do have to admit that there was not as much selection there as at some of the other resorts and there wasn't much of a game room for the kids like at other resorts, but we really didn't each much at the resort and our child was not at WDW to play arcade games, so we made due. The Christmas decorations at the GF were amazing! From the thousands of pointsettias outside and the deer lit up at night, to the larger than life Gingerbread house in and the enormous tree in the lobby, it really put us in the Holiday Spirit just being there! The monorail and the boats made it easy to get around. We recommend taking the monorail to the MK in the morning, but ride the boat back in the evenings, especially if you are there 'til the park closes. Our check out went well. A bell hop picked us and our bags up and took us to the front. The seats on the car were wet, so he went and got a towel so that he could dry the seats. Overall, we were happy with the choice we had made.

Previously, we'd stayed at the Wilderness Lodge (and loved it), but the GF is less a hotel and more a huge resort. The grounds are spacious and beautifully landscaped, so the crowds and noise of the parks seem miles away. The resort has two large swimming pools, a beach (no swimming), boat rental, a spa, and a fitness center. The main building has a beautiful atrium area where we spent several evenings relaxing after dinner. Live music is played every evening by a pianist or a band, and it makes for a lovely place to sit and relax before turning in. The room we stayed in was a garden view with two queens (aka-the cheapest rooms). However we were pleasantly surprised to find even our cheap view was lovely. We were in Big Pine Key where rooms on one side of the building face the grounds and one of the pools, and the other side (where we were) faced the lake, the beach, and the other pool, but we could also see the wedding pavillion, the monorail, and the Polynesian. I don't imagine there are any bad views there at all. Our room was MUCH larger than a standard room at the Wilderness Lodge. There were two queen beds, a sofa that converted to a comfy bed, an easy chair with ottoman, and a desk. The bathroom was large with marble floors, counters, and shower and a double vanity. There was also a big closet with two robes. (I used one every night. A nice touch.) The housekeeping service was great. They did personal things like use my younger son's blanket from home to make up the bed where he slept. They also have nightly turn down service where they turn down your bed and bring you ice and chocolates. The bell service at the hotel was great and very quick to respond. We also got great service at the concierge desk. The only down side to such good service is we found ourselves handing out lots of tips. I only have minor criticisms. On our first night, we had a huge roach in our bathroom. So we killed him and never saw another. We didn't fret since Florida is bug heaven. The walls to the hotel seemed a bit thin as we could hear more than we expected from the other rooms. We could hear voices, phones ringing, water running, and toilets flushing, which was disappointing in such an expensive place. Also the room had a rickety ceiling fan that seemed about to fall off the ceiling if we turned it on medium or high. It would have been nice to put it on high so the sound would drown out the hotel noises. And the armoire with drawers for clothes was too small to hold all our clothing. We stayed a week and didn't have enough drawers or hangers for a week's worth of clothes. But the armoire contains a fridge, so that's where the space for drawers went. The resort has five restaurants and various shops. All the shops are nice and range from selling sundries, to souvenirs, to expensive clothing. We ate at three of the restaurants. The counter service place, Gasparillas, has a nice variety, but we didn't want to eat in there because of the noise from the arcade games and the fact that there were birds flying around indoors. (I don't mind birds if I'm outside, but indoor birds landing on my table is too much.) The Grand Floridian Cafe was a lovely place for any meal with good food and service. And Citricos was pricey but delicious. So we enjoyed all three of the ones we tried. Having monorail or boat service to the Magic Kingdom was great for us as it's our favorite park. You take a bus anywhere else. But to sum up, my husband and kids are all converts to the Grand Floridian and say that's the only place they'll stay in the future. It's an expensive place but very nice. We used the \"buy 4, get 3\" special they were running, so our package cost the same as the identical package at the Wilderness Lodge 3 years ago.

There was a certain level of customer service I expected and did not receive. First of all they did not have my reservation when I tried to check in. Finally they found a room for me because I had a confirmation. Well it was clearly a reject room. I was in building 7 on the first floor by a door that opened and slammed shut 150 times a day. I called the desk after being there for a couple of hours and asked what the door was too and if it would stop slamming by the early evening. She said \"I don't know where the door goes and it should get quieter.\" That was not the answer for me. I went to open the door for myself and it goes outside. It was the service enterance and any other guest could use it also. Well it opened and closed until around 12:30am. Keep in mind I have a 2 year old and we were not sleeping. The next morning I went to the front desk and asked to be moved and told them the problem. Did a manager come out to the desk and address the problem? You would expect that at a 5 star hotel. They take their customer service very seriously. No, the desk girl came back out and said we will change your room as soon as we get one available. I said OK we are going to the Magic Kingdom. She said they would call. We got back to the room around 130pm and I had not received a call. I called guest information and they said my room was ready. They sent a bellman and he did not know the new room number so he called to the front. They told him it was not ready. MAJOR COMMUNICATION ISSUES!!! So we waited in the room for a little while and I got a call at 3pm. This guy asks me why we haven't moved yet? I lost it then. You have got to be kidding me. He said if you are changing rooms, you need to do it by 11am. Needless to say when I was done with him we were on our way to a new room. The next morning we were leaving and it was pooring. They pick you and your luggage up in golf carts. The cart was soaked. I asked for something to wipe the seat and I was told he had nothing. I asked why they don't have covers over the carts, he, the bellman, replied \" it is not in the budget.\" So, as much money as you are paying you could get better service else where!!! This is the best.......... Before leaving I went to the front desk to voice my complaints, I asked for the customer service manager. The girl, Joselen, looked at me like I was crazy and said they don't have one. I told her that was her first problem and proceeded to tell my story.

My family (husband, two children ages 2 & 4) and I stayed at the Grand Floridian the week of May 16, 2009. We paid for and received a standard, garden view room. Our unit was in the Big Pine Key building which I requested due to its central location to the pool, monorail, and main building. The room contained 2 queen beds and a comfortable day bed which allowed my children to sleep separately. The room slept 4 comfortably, but 5 people could easily fit. Housekeeping did a good job and the girls loved the chocolate on their pillows each night. Housekeeping would even tuck the girls stuff animals in at night, which brought an extra smile to the girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 faces. We never got a chance to eat at the high end restaurants or use the gym/spa so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to their services but both pools were enjoyable with plenty of towels and seating. We dined at the 1900 Park Fare for character meals at breakfast and dinner, and the quality of food was much better than other character buffets in Disney World. The monorail and boat ride to and from the Magic Kingdom was incredibly convenient. Likewise, the bus transportation to and from Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom was convenient. We never had to wait longer than 20 minutes for a bus. Certainly a rental car would be more efficient but the free transportation was reliable. What travelers need to remember is that this is a Disney resort. You pay a premium to be near the parks. Certainly you can find a nicer and less expensive hotel somewhere else in Orlando. But if you want to be in the Disney complex and feel like you are at a resort and not a theme based hotel, then the Grand Floridian is the way to go. We have stayed at the Polynesian for leisure and Coronado Springs for work and neither can compare to this stay. The rooms are nicely decorated, the grounds are beautiful and the staff was very friendly in comparison to the other locations. For the few extra dollars between the Polynesian and the Grand Floridian, the Grand Floridian is the hands down choice. I have heard other travelers say that the Grand Floridian is not kid friendly and we did not believe that to be true. The pools were filled with families, Gasparilla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grill is filled with arcades and the musicians in the main lobby played princess music so the little girls could dance throughout the grand main lobby. We like to provide honest reviews and feel we learn the most from what others list as the drawbacks of a particular hotel. So here are the drawbacks: We asked at check in for one guardrail for our 2 year old\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed. It never came. We called housekeeping for the guardrail and they said they would be right over with it. Again, it never came. We quickly realized we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it but still, it should have been brought to our room right away. There are birds flying around inside Gasparilla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grill.

My husband and I, our 7 month old daughter and my mother stayed in one room with two queen beds and we had plenty of room. The hotel provided us with a small white metal crib for our daughter. I was a little worried when I saw the metal crib, but they provided us with Disney themed sheets and a matching bumper. Our daughter seemed to sleep very well in the crib. The pool was heated and stayed open into the late night - we actually went swimming at 9:30pm. We ate breakfast in the hotel's 1900 Park Fair resturant two mornings in a row because our daughter loved the characters. The first morning we lucked out and only had to wait about 20 minutes, however, we made reservations for the following morning. The food was good, but the best part was seeing our daughter's face light up when she saw Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland, and the Mad Hatter. The hotel has a monorail stop right outside, which travels to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot. During our last trip to Disney, we stayed at the Dolphin, which doesn't have monorail access. We had to use the buses and it was a big pain and took forever. Having a monorail stop right at our hotel was very convenient!

My children loved the two pools, especially the beach pool with the water slide. The lifeguards did a great job of making it safe, but letting it be fun. There were many events and activities for the kids all day long. Riding the boat from Magic Kingdom to the hotel is a must do, although the monorail is faster. The room - we paid a premium for Magic Kingdom view and could only barely see it from a corner of our porch. We were assured we could see the fireworks from our room and we couldn't. The hall carpets were stained and a bit old. The halls need to be swept or vacuumed in the evening. It was dirty by around 9pm. The rooms are small for the price. The shampoo and conditioner provided by the hotel were so sticky you couldn't get them out of the bottle. The 24 hour \"quick service\" dining area is off the beaten track and the only place you can refill your drink cups. We spent time being thirsty at poolside.

We absolutely loved it. We got a top floor dormer room which was clean, luxurious (good beds, linens, and finishes), well-appointed, well-kept, but slightly smaller than I expected. That turned out not to be a big deal at all since all we did was sleep and shower there, but it was nice to come sleep and shower in a comfy room. Pros: We love the style of the place, the lobby is very pleasant, the grounds are lush and impeccable, the staff (cast) is WONDERFUL (but we do tip)(the cleaning lady made us a swan out of washcloths and put the soaps and lotions in it, a male employee gave our daughter a nosegay of flowers in the lobby and bowed to her, the porters were jovial, garrulous and helpful, I think every single castmember we passed smiled at our daughter and said \"Hello, princess!\" although she wasn't dressed as one, and all our inquiries, bookings, and arrangements with desk staff were handled with smiles and laughter), our 2-yr old daughter adored the white sand beach (you can't swim in the lake, though) and zero entry pool and waterfall, the luggage handling was seamless, and the dining was the best we have ever had at Disney (and I grew up nearby.) More on dining later. Cons: the room was slightly smaller than I would have liked, and I am not sure what the other room styles are like. It was expensive, but we knew that going in. Room service was very expensive and was elegant and tasty but not really worth it in such a small room (the tray was huge to accommodate all the little extras and separate serving dishes). I travel a lot for business, lugging my own bags, and it may seem trivial, but it was really nice not to have to handle our own luggage for this trip (it was heavy). We arrived hours before check-in and they made it extremely simple to check our bags straight from the trunk of our rental car to their bag-check area without us even touching them. They were taken to our room when it was ready and were waiting for us when we got back from the park later. We did the Magical Express for the return journey, and had the bags checked at the hotel, where they were picked up from our room after we called to indicate they were ready, and the next time we saw them was on a baggage carousel at home. They do this at the other Disney resorts, but the staff was just so friendly, helpful and pleasant at the Grand Floridian. I am somewhat of a foodie (or food snob), I think, but I could find nothing to complain about at the GF eating establishments we visited. In general, they were miles above the similarly priced restaurants in the parks. We planned our dining and made reservations for almost the whole trip before we went, which really helped. However, we found that we could walk right in to the Cafe without reservations most times when we found ourselves at a loose end. The food there was better than anything in the parks we have had, even at the \"better\" venues. (Their Tuna Nicoise salad beat the pants off the identically named product at the French restaurant at Epcot, for example - I couldn't even choke down the latter, thinking about the one I had had at the GF Cafe.) The service was prompt, pleasant, attentive, and friendly. We dined at Narcoosee's in the evening and got to see the light show on the lagoon. The food and the experience were excellent and worth the price, and service there was also stellar. The High Tea in the Garden View Lounge was a magical experience, with our 2 yr old daughter in a sundress and straw hat, sipping herbal tea from a gold-rimmed tea cup with roses on it almost bigger than she was, learning to use a tea strainer and sugar tongs, and eating sandwiches and pastries with us. My husband accidentally knocked over his champagne, breaking the glass into his mostly-empty plate, and the waitress was perfectly attentive and brought him a completely new meal while he went to the room to change clothes. For breakfasts, we usually ate at the Gasparilla Grille, so our daughter could have Mickey-shaped waffles with Mickey-shaped sprinkles (she was mystified and then thrilled that one could have sprinkles on waffles), and I could have eggs and my husband could have cereal or pancakes. It is a little crowded sometimes, because it takes three times as long for the cashiers to ring up the customers with meal plans because they have to figure out how to designate each item, I think, then type in codes or something. But overall it got us out to the parks in time for opening most days with something tasty and mostly healthy in us. Oh, and the valet parking was a pleasure (I usually dread it).", "Date": "May 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ct", "Title": "\u201cgood but not worth the price tag\u201d", "Author": "des112Ct", "ReviewID": "UR29448612", "Content": "My stay was 4/27-5/08 the service was very good is it is at all disney resorts.

There were positives and negatives to the stay: Negatives When I walked into my room in the Conch Key building (4th floor), I was so disapointed. After being in the luxury of the JW Marriott...the GF seemed average. Our bathroom had a shower curtain and our bathtub had one of those 80's style plastic crystal faucets. The worst part is that it had mildew inside of it! The rest of the room was clean except for spider webs on my door wall, which were never cleaned up the entire 5 days. I asked to be switched to a different room, but all they had was a first floor room so I kept my room. Their 2 pools are nice, but could use an update, the tiling around the pools are faded. The fitness area needs better equipment and a remodel. Positives, Disney Magic... I could see the fireworks from my room every night. Cute little girls dressed as Princesses all over the resort. The monorail..it was very easy and quick to get to Magic Kingdom. The service was excellent. The only 5 star facilites that I found in the hotel was the spa. Very nice! The flowers around the resort are really beautiful. I would never back to the GF. There is much better in Orlando for the money. I also stayed at Animal Kingdom Lodge last year and I would rate it higher than The GF. The Animal Kingdom Lodge is a quarter of the price of GF and has nicer facilities (the best pool in Disney). If you have a large vacation budget and want to be close to Magic Kingdom then , The GF might be for you. If you still want to be on Disney property and don't mind a 30 minute bus ride to Magic Kingdom then Animal Kingdom is a great choice. If you want real 5 star facilities in Orlando then check out the JW and Ritz Carlton at Grand Lakes (30 minute taxi to Magic Kingdom). They are still half the price of The GF.

She was blown away when we pulled into the resort, and fell in love with it. I had went there for breakfast when I was a teenager about ten years ago, and my uncle got married there in 1998. I always wanted to stay there. The grounds are wonderful, and well taken care of. I loved just sitting in the lobby and listening to the band play. Every staff member I came in contact with was friendly and helpful. It is in a great location when you have young children with you and want to be close to the Magic Kingdom. The monorail was great to have. On my first visit I stayed in the Conch Key building with a Magic Kingdom view. It was very nice. I only recommend to ask for with a third or fourth floor room. Top floor rooms are nice, but they are dormer rooms, and the balconies are very small. The last trip we stayed in rooms in the Boca Chica building. We had a third floor room with a Magic Kingdom view. It was so great and beautiful view. Also the balconies were great, and large. Great for viewing the fireworks and water show every night. It has two pools. The Boca Chica building was right next to the pool. A short walk to get there. I am an early riser, so I was up at 5:30am and went swimming. The Grand Floridian Cafe was a favorite spot for meals for us. The staff was great, and remembered us from the trip before. We even made friends with our waiter, and still keep in touch with him. 1900 Park Fare was great for the kids too. The food was wonderful. The princess and friends came around to the table and took pictures and signed the kids autograph books. We had gone to the dinner show at the Polynesian the night before, and hated it. The show was horrible, as was the food. Definitely not worth the money they charged. Narcosses was my favorite. Great food and location. The rooms are nice, except the maid service doesn't seem that great for that kind of hotel. That was my only issue. Other then that it seems very clean and well taken care of. The Polynesian seems run down and dark, and has a smell of mildew and mold. Same with the Contemporary. We went over there for some drinks and were so happy we didn't stay there. The grounds are nothing much to look at, and the building itself is not that appealing. I don't understand how other reviewers didn't like it. I guess it is just a matter of opinion.

The Grand Floridian was everything I could have wanted in a Disney hotel and more. Reserved a standard garden view room (all they had available when I booked only 2 months in advance) but asked for a room w/ view upon check in and was given free upgrade to MK view room. The room had incredible view of MK fireworks and the boat parade that comes by at about 10 pm. Only disadvantage, my room was a top floor dormer, w/ no sofa bed, only 2 queens. But since we had been given the free upgrade, I didn't quite want to say hey thanks for the upgrade, but how about one w/ a sofa bed? Room pros: robes, fridge, very comfy beds (and I'm very picky), balcony w/view, quiet (we were there 1st week feb, i believe the hotel was not full) spacious enough, excellent housekeeping, lots of towels without even having to ask, View!, coffee maker in room. Room cons: No vending machine, no mini bar. have to walk to main bldg to buy drinks, etc. just plan ahead, you have a fridge (one tip- I'm not cheap but water was $2 for a 500ml bottle. Buy the 1.5 L size for just a little more $). The gift shop and Gaspirillas have pop, water, milk etc. Pools great, it was cold while we were there so only used them a couple times, but water was warm in pool, if you could stand the air. Used the exercise room in spa once, it was great .. a bit far from main hotel, but I got some exercise getting there! Hotel food: Citrico's - excellent, and I consider myself a foodie. Narcosee's- good, fireworks at MK could be seen from dining room. Grand Floridian cafe- good food there, too. 1900 park fare- even the food at the character buffett was decent Gaspirillas- Ok for what it is. pizza edible, decent healthier selections of chicken sadwich, cheese plate, etc You have to understand that at disney if you want a sit down meal, you must book in advance to guarentee a seat. Plain and simple. Having said that, we were there at a slow time and managed to have a non reserved meal at Narcosee's and non reserved breakfast at GF cafe twice. Did not use dining plan as we wanted to eat at the fine restaurants, and wished to be unrestircted. One tip, we came to Disney w/out car. I brought some cold cereal and plastic bowls and spoons, bought milk at hotel, and had breakfast in room each AM. Saved a ton of time, we had the in room coffee maker, cereal and juice early and were at the park for opening. On days we had no immediate plans, the GF cafe had lovely breakfast. Can't beat location close to MK on monorail. The one time wehad to take bus (to animal kingdom) it was abour 20 min wait for bus, then ride to other resorts before ariving at AK. Additional notes: Used the Magical express bus service from airport--- no complaints( a little hard to find in airport--no signs. ask somebody, then you will find it) We were immediately acknowledged at check in, taken to our room in a cart and given helpful hints by the staff on way to our room. There were few crowds, again, we were there at a slow time with colder weather. Due to bad weather, our flight cancelled and we arrived a day later than planned. I phoned Disney and they kindly accomadated taking one day off at the begining of our trip and adding one on at the end. The service of shops at theme parks shipping your purchase to your resort is very helpful, and free of charge. The fireworks at MK were crowded and the view of them was better from my room. Next time I will book early to make sure I get a guarenteed MK view..its worth the $$ Overall, great place. I will stay there time I go to Disney.

We couldn't get reservations for *any* of the 5 days we stayed here because they were already pre-booked. Clearly you should book even your breakfast well in advance of your arrival if you want the theme buffet. Our lagoon-view rooms are very small and cramped.

I'm starting to get the \"Theme\" here - it's \"Nickel and dime..nickel and dime...\" - I think I heard Mickey and Minnie singing that tune as they skipped down Main Street USA.

We stayed from January 24th through February 1st. Check-in was a breeze and easy...room wasn't ready until 3:00. No problem she said it would be worth the wait.....boy was it. We booked a regular room and received an lake front room right in front of the boat launch to Magic Kingdom. I'm not sure if a better room existed. We had sent a fax to the Grand Floridian asking for a room with a few a week prior and it apparently paid off. We opted for the dining plan as well and found this was a fantastic deal We got a snack, quick service meal and a sit down meal. My wife booked all the reservation about 3 weeks out with no problems. The dinners averaged about 150.00 and all we had to pay was the tip. The quick services lunches were good too...except for Magic Kingdom....limited selection and usually junk type food. Better quick service lunch options at the other parks. The crowds were at a minimum and all of the good rides did not have much of a wait...approx. 15-20 minutes max. The Grand Floridian was grand and loved the Momorail service to Magic Kinigdom and Epcot. The boat service back from MK was terrific too.....and our room was steps from the boat launch. The price was right with flights and I have no complaints. I thnk it would be a good idea to sit down and listen to the vacation club early in on your vacation as I heard the kids like it and they make it worth your while...I think a Disnet gift card for a good chunk of money is given to listen to the sell story. I heard it is worth doing...after the fact. We had dinner all over the parks. Cafe De France, Mexico, Morraco, Grand Floridian and once at MGM...the Italian restautrant...forgot the name. All the meals were great and a little similar. The snack options were also pretty good...escpecially at the Bakery on Main Street USA. You can get a box of cereal and a milk for a snack voucher....good deal. They also had a enormous cinnamon roll listed as a snack option. I would definitely stay at the GF again in a heart beat. If we go again I would most likely try somwething different as we have stayed at the Contemporary the Carribean Beach Resort and now the GF. My wife was looking at the Boardwalk resorts and seemed to like to ability to wasily get to Epcot and Hollywood studios from that area.....I think you can walk to both. I went with my children ages 11 and 8 and they still had a wonderful time woth some great memories. Disney treated us right again. We also rented a car and drove around to many of the parks with ease. The new picture options were great where they just scan your card and you can go online later at home and decided if you want to purchase any of the pictures taken by the many photographers all over all the parks. We also stopped at a local grocery store and bought some milk OJ and cereal and snacks for the kids. The refridgerator in the room was nice to have. Each morning they had breakfast on the cheap as this saved a lot of money on not having to purchase breakfast.....this was a good idea.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAnother Magical Stay at The GF!\u201d", "Author": "LoveToTravel1129", "ReviewID": "UR24510654", "Content": "From the time I was a little girl my family has always enjoyed spending time together by traveling to Walt Disney World and staying at our favorite Grand Floridian.

As a teacher who only makes $35,000/year, I could never afford the Grand Floridian and was somewhat sickened by some guests there that complained about EVERYTHING. I was fortunate to find a great discount, so my husband and I spent 2 nights there in January for our anniversary. We were very impressed with the magic. When we walked into the lobby, a cast member immediately escorted us to an available person for check-in. Check-in was quick and easy, and they were able to grant us a king bed room, even though there are only 18 in the entire resort. I briefly mentioned that it was our anniversary, and they gave us the buttons to wear. The room was much larger than other hotels I've visited and had top of the line toiletries. There were white cotton robes for us to use during our stay, a flat-screen TV, refrigerator, and large balcony with a view of the monorail. We were pleasantly surprised to come back to our room the first night to the room being turned down for bed time. Lights were dimmed, chocolates were on the bed, and curtains were pulled. On day 2, a knock on the door revealed a cast member offering us champagne and a photo and signed card from Mickey and Minnie. What a special treat! The convenience to the Magic Kingdom is unmatched. Not having car traffic anywhere near the resort was so peaceful. Walking along the beach to the Polynesian was beautiful. The fireworks and water parade were extra treats. It was my impression that many Grand Floridian guests are richer than rich and don't appreciate any of the magic that the cast members give to the guests. These people wouldn't be content with any kind of service. But I was certainly very happy with the Grand Floridian!

The service is excellent, the grounds are gorgeous, and the location is the best. The Grand is not perfect - the bathrooms could really use an update and it can be noisy - but it is the best on Disney property. That said, I will certainly try the Four Seasons if it does open on Disney property. We did have one wrinkle with the first room to which we were assigned. It was right next to the elevator, and the elevator bells and people talking kept me up all night. I should have asked for a switch as soon as I saw the location, but it was 2 am and I was tired so I did not, a decision I regretted within an hour. The front desk easily switched us to a better room the next morning. I would suggest requesting a room at the end of the hall, on a floor other than the 1st floor, for the best standard rooms. We have also stayed in the theme park view rooms - worth it - and one of the suites in the main building, which is wonderful if you can afford it. I recommend dinner at Narcoisses if you like seafood. The food was executed well and the service was perfect. The restaurant has a great atmosphere - go early and enjoy a cocktail on the porch while watching the fireworks.

One stop on the monorail and a boat ride back in less than 5 minutes. The Concierge service was superb - Vonnie - in particular went out of her way to facilitate us. The breakfast and snacks/drinks available during the day were very good - few people were there and you could help yourself quickly and easily. The DVD's available from the Concierge desk was very useful in the evenings when our kids needed some downtime in our room. We ate in Victoria & Albert's and while it was enjoyable - we didn't think they quite pulled in off in terms of food quality/service. We had read so much about it - we really thought it would be incredible. Good but not that amazing. A disappointment was that there were not Disney characters around the hotel during breakfast etc - unless you booked the Character breakfast in the Park Fare restaurant and then only a limited selection of characters. We have stayed in the Disneyland Hotel at Disneyland Paris every Spring for the past 6 years and having a huge selection of characters just walking down the corridors or greeting you as your enter the breakfast area or available at photo points in the hotel has been a huge treat for our children. In needs of travelling with a special needs child - we have found Disneyland Paris more accommodating in the Parks - particularly for character photos and at the disabled viewing points. However, the Concierge service more than made up for any disappointments we found with Cast Members in the Parks. Perhaps it is because there are so many adults/children with special needs travelling around the Parks in WDW but we have certainly found it an easier and more friendly experience in Disneyland Paris. Overall however we would recommend the Grand Floridian hotel and the Concierge level. It was a quiet calm oasis in the middle of Walt Disney World that served us very well in terms of location particularly for the Magic Kingdom.

When she heard we were there celebrating my 40th birthday she made every effort to ensure our stay would be wonderful. With an amazing view of the castle, we watched the light parade on the water and the fireworks 5 out of 7 nights that we were there.She was worried because there was a tree to the right of the deck that faced Cinderella's Castle. I have no idea why considering it did not impair our view at all. The room was clean and extremely spacious. Housekeeping was polite and accomodating in every way. My kids LOVED the pools. We spent most of our pool time on the waterslide and under the waterfall. On Thankgiving evening we ate at Narcosees. The food and service were exceptional, 5 star dining, could be a little pricey if you have little ones. We watched the fireworks from our table as we ate our \"Nemo\" cupcakes.

Our first disappointing experience was during check-in when they had our oldest son listed as a child on our reservation (which would have included him receiving \"child\" meals with the dining plan) despite my having confirmation of our reservation with him as an \"adult.\" We were instructed to go to the concierge desk to have this corrected and the young woman who helped us suggested we simply go to the parks and \"see how he does with the children's menus.\" I informed her that during our last visit, the child's menu was not enough food for him and now, two years later, it certainly was not going to work. Additionally, I paid for him as an adult and I expected this to be corrected. After 40 minutes of waiting, the issue was resolved and she was very apologetic -- stating that the system had uploaded our reservation incorrectly and could she make it up to us with free FastPasses -- we readily accepted and she returned with THREE FastPasses for a family of FOUR! She stated that was all they had. Our next disappointment was with housekeeping in our room -- Sago Key, Room 4511. Upon check-in, there was a large \"glob\" of toothpaste on the bathroom door that I cleaned up -- how someone could have missed it, I don't know. Within seconds we found a \"razor guard\" on the floor that would have easily been picked up in a vacuum sweeper had someone actually vacuumed. These types of oversights upon check-in can only make you guess what else has not been attended to! I did put a call into housekeeping and shared this information with them and a manager did come to our room to apologize but the service never improved and I stopped leaving a gratuity after the second day. Our shower was so slow-draining that, by the end of your shower, you were standing in water up to your ankles which is just gross. Why housekeeping did not resolve this issue with maintenance, I don't know. Also, our bathroom door kept locking on it's own ... go figure! We had to call maintenance twice and the second time was first thing in the morning when we were all trying to get ready to make an ADR for a character breakfast. Despite two phone calls and a 45-minute wait, we never saw anyone from maintenance and our boys resorted to urinating in two empty water bottles since they couldn't wait any longer. Call me crazy but I expect better service than this when paying in excess of $400/night for a room. I have received better service than this when staying at \"chain\" hotels. Lastly, on our last day when we were checking out, we resorted to getting a luggage trolley on our own as no one was showing up to our room. On our way to the front entrance, one of the porters actually stopped his cart with other Grand guests sitting in it with him and reprimanded us for taking the trolley. He had the gall to admonish us and tell us we better make sure we got the trolley back to our building! No offer of help, no offer to call anyone ... nothing! Nothing but disparate words for us in front of other guests! I stopped at the desk on our way out and told one of the desk personnel of our experience being admonished by one of your porters -- her response to me was that she didn't know what \"admonished\" meant. I have always left the Grand happily planning our next visit, but not this time.

From when you first set foot into the resort, there are always people ready to serve you. Right after a speedy check in with no line, a very kind bell-hop brought us to a golf-cart where he showed us a tour of the property and then brought us to our room. As for the rooms, I thought they were definitely five-star. Online, I didn't think that the pictures of the rooms looked too good. However, after seeing them in person, I thought that they were much more impressive. I had a standard garden-view room, but it still was very spacious, with nice touches such as a large day-bed, two sinks in the bathroom, a separate area for the shower and toilet, an iHome clock radio that works with your iPod, a plasma TV, and a large sized mini fridge. The beds were very comfortable with a good pillow selection that ranged from soft to firm. Another nice touch was the resort's complimentary turn-down service. Every night, another group of housekeepers would come and turn down your room. They would replace your linens and towels, turn down your beds (including the day bed), make a couple of towel animals, restock your ice bucket, and leave a chocolate on your pillow. The one complaint I have about the rooms is that they could be very noisy. If somebody was talking outside in the hallway, you could clearly hear it. Luckily, I was in one of the quieter buildings, Sago Cay, that didn't have too many children in it. The resort facilities were great. The two pools were very spacious, one of them had a hot tub and the other had a waterside. The white-sand beach was perfect for viewing the Magic Kingdom fireworks, but note that you aren't allowed to swim in the water. The hotel also was great for transportation, particularly because you could take the monorail to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot. I would recommend the Grand Floridian to anybody who can afford to stay there. Just remember that it is the fanciest of all the Disney World Resorts, and it does have a much more formal (and I must say classy) atmosphere that other Disney hotels.

Its is very expensive by any standard - I paid $525 for each of 2 rooms - more than I pay at Four Sesons in Miami or close to Intercontinental in Paris. Anyhow, we were shown to our rooms at a hotel wing that was remodeling, nice boarded wall outside our balcony, lots of noise from compressors and the smeel of paint everywhere. After declining this horrific room - we were 5, my wife, our 11, 8 and 2 years old and I - were moved to a new building. This new rooms were besides the ice machine room, and therefore you can imagine the noise at night from the machine compressor, on and off, every hour. Did not complain again, too tired for that at that time. In all sincerity, I felt we were taken advantage us by the management, since we came from abroad, however as I said, these rooms were very expensive and in my opinion, very very overpriced.

We had a garden view room, with extra sofa bed (we did not use it) and two queen size beds. Restaurants: We ate breakfast at the resort restaurant and found it to be adequate -- food was good, service was great and prices were high, as anywhere else in the touristy place like Disney. Resort also has a small convinience store that carries a lot of food items. There are nice tables and chairs outside, so it would be very easy to make your own breakfast. Grounds: Immaculate.

The hotel shows a little bit of its age despite the upgraded flat screen TV.

It is pricey but realistically you are paying for location which is worth it.

When we would arrive at our room in the afternoon it was always spotless and when we would arrive back in the late evenings there was nothing like having our beds turned down for us. The main lobby always had some kind of activity. For instance, one afternoon there was a little parade of princesses that must have been at the Floridian for the afternoon tea party. Every evening there was a piano player and there was nothing like watching the little ones twirling around in their little princess costumes to the piano music.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a just a beautiful hotel and has a great location. I stayed here with my mom and my boyfriend, while my mom was there on business. We had transferred from another resort because we came in for an extra day that was not part of the business trip. So when we arrived to our room that night, we expected our bags to have made the transfer and to have already been in our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at 10pm. So that was just something that should have been automatically done at a resort like this one. But our room had a great view of the lagoon and was a nice size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c comfortable for the three of us. But it is really expensive. We did have a few disappointments here though. For such an expensive place, we thought everything would be perfect. One day we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have hot water at all and we were pretty much told to deal with it. Although, someone did come up later and was very apologetic about the situation, so I guess that helped a little. We loved that the monorail and buses stopped here, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like how long everything took. Since the Grand Floridian is close to Disney World \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really close to anything else. So, the bus would go directly to a park on the way there, but on the way back to the resort it would stop at either one or two other resorts first \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so a bus ride back could take almost an hour. That was really frustrating after a long day at a park or Downtown Disney. The same goes for the monorail. Going to the Magic Kingdom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one stop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but on the way back you need to go all the way around the lagoon. I recommend using the water taxi. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice trip and will go directly to the Grand Floridian from the Magic Kingdom. The pool and beach areas are really nice. We enjoyed both. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hot tub on the main pool, which is really nice in the morning. Also, at night you can see the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom and the Electric Light parade on the lagoon right from the resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so that was really nice. For a nice sit down lunch, the Grand Floridian Caf\u00c3\u00a9 is nice. They have good sized portions and a lot of options. We did make reservations for here though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just in case. We made reservations at a lot of restaurants just in case \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because it saves a lot of additional waiting time. For breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we just did the quick service Gasparilla Grill and Games every morning. But like everything \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even cereal seems pricey. This is definitely a more adult resort. While the resort is beautiful, has a waterfall pool and has character meals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are other hotels that are more themed that kids might enjoy better. This is a good resort for couples or families with older children. Overall, we enjoyed staying here. However, staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge right before this put things in perspective for us. We liked both resorts but for the cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we would probably do the Lodge over the Floridian if we had the choice again.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago IL", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "familygalChicagoIL", "ReviewID": "UR17798956", "Content": "No denying the location speaks for itself.

Well there are some minor issues, Firstly this is not a cheap Holiday and the cost rises still once your there, the restaurants are wonderful but can be expensive, and the Valet parking is $10 at time!!! Also the Bathroom in our room was Tiny and the decoration does make the rooms seem a little more dated than even the Hotel tries to be, the other main gripe was that as a guest of the Hotel you didn't get priority tables in the restraunts and if they were booked it was tough!

The key to this hotel's success as a honeymoon destination, in my opinion, is the little extra touches they provide for their newlywed couples. My husband and I had originally booked a Lodge Tower room (slightly larger than a standard room with an extra balcony and living area); however, upon arrival, we were informed that as we were on our honeymoon we had been upgraded to one of the octagonal honeymoon suites on the Concierge level (we later found out from housekeeping that our room usually costs around $2000 a night!) Also, 10 minutes after we'd arrived in our room we were presented with a red rose for myself, a chilled bottle of champagne and a signed card/photo of congratulations from Mickey and Minnine Mouse. As if that wasn't enough, when we returned from dinner on our first night we'd found that the lady who provided our turndown service had laid a thick carpet of rose petals on our floor leading to a huge rose petal heart on our bed! I cannot begin to explain what a wonderful tone all these little touches set for the rest of our holiday. At Disneyworld, the five-star treatment doesn't end once you enter the parks. Upon check-in we were presented with \"just married\" badges, which we were advised to wear at the parks. The staff at Disney are actually trained to look out for these badges and we were met with warm congratulations easily about 50 times a day! Also, every time we entered a counter-service restaurant we were given either free cookies, puddings or drinks. Again, little extras like this can help turn a great holiday into an amazing holiday. The Grand Floridian is home to some of the nicest, most sophisticated restaurants in the whole of the WDW resort. We were lucky enough to be able to enjoy two evenings at Citricos ( a southern European restaurant) and I cannot recommend this retaurant enough for the ultimate romantic dinner. Tip: ask for a table near the window so you can enjoy the Magic Kingdom fireworks while you dine). If shopping is a key part of your life, the hotel has some gorgeous boutique-type shops where you can buy clothes, shoes, bath products and the usual Disney merchandise. Another way in which you're spoiled for choice at the Grand Floridian is with the transport to the rest of Disneyworld.As well as the free Disney buses to everywhere, the Magic Kingdom can also be reached by boat (so romantic at night) and by monorail; this is also the only way to get to EPCOT from this hotel. My main piece of advice for anyone thinking of booking this hotel is to spend the extra money and go on the Concierge level: not only do you get your own private concierge (perfect for booking dinner reservations - the rest of the resort has to share a concierge in the main lobby and every day the queues looked huge) but you're also treated to free food and drink during the day, starting with a wide variety of breakfast goods to freshly-made cookies and canapes in the evening and wine, beer and spirits (including some very expensive cognacs and whiskeys!) Coffee, tea, water and soft drinks are also available 24 hours a day. Overall, I really can't say enough nice things about this hotel and its staff, who were all absolutely incredible.

I sayed for five days at this hotel having booked a suite on the 4th floor. The place is so big it can be a little daunting at first but you soon settle in and the staff are very keen to ensure you get exactly what you want from your stay. The room was very clean, spacious and well appointed with LCD tvs, cd players and all the other mod-cons one expects. Breakfast was taken on the landing area on the 4th floor. These guest areas can only be accessed with a room key so you are not bothered by the crowds of photographers admiring the architecture. Complimentary food is served here throughout most of the day so if you fancy a light bite rather than a full meal this is a great and cost effective option. Dinner was taken in Citricos restaurant each night because the food was superb, the service was right on the button and I could enjoy a priviledged view of the fireworks over Magic Kingdom each night. The pool areas are well maintained and big enough to enjoy, even at busy times. It is well worth taking a boat around the lagoon, its great fun and you get some stunning views of the hotel and the surrounding area.

I was completely wrong. My family and I (husband and two kids ages 4 and 6) really loved everything about this hotel and I think that although expensive, it really is very similar to staying in a high end chain like a Ritz-Carlton. We had two rooms overlooking the Magic Kingdom and they were completely spotless which I think is impressive given the number of kids that are staying in these rooms all of the time. The furnishings, bathroom, linens, etc. all great. I-pod docking stations were provided which I think is nice. And the rooms were spacious. We took the recommendations of some other people and made sure to get a second floor room as we were told there could be an issue with pigeons and that sort of mess on the balcony if you have a third story room. The only complaint I might have is that we were right by the dock for the boat that goes to the magic kingdom and I will say that it blasts this huge horn starting at something like 7AM. This of course woke my kids up every morning and they were tired b/c we were always in the parks late. Also, I would say that it is not necessarily worth the extra money for a Magic Kingdom view. There are so many places to watch the fireworks from the property and we were usually in the park for them anyway. The lobby of the hotel is gorgeous and we were there for the holidays so it was beautifully decorated. One night we put our kids in the Disney club that they have (basically just babysitting in a room - although my kids really had fun) so that my husband and I could have dinner at the upscale restaurant they have there (Victoria and Albert's I think) and it was a very special meal. Expensive, five-star kind of meal but very lovely for a special occasion. A nice grown-up break after many days of being in the parks. The pools were nice - our kids liked both pools but probably preferred the one with the slides. The main pool was really huge and had a great, huge hot tub. We rented a boat and took the kids out on the lagoon which they loved. We also saw a large group of kids going on a \"pirate cruise\" type of thing. Our kids did not do this but we spoke with some people who sent their kids on this and they really loved it. I think that might be another nice way for parents to get a few hours break if you feel like you need it. The boat leaves right from the hotel for a couple of hours and like I mentioned it looked like the kids who did it (maybe 20 - 30 at a time) had lots of fun. I think with young children being close to the Magic Kingdom is really invaluable - we could easily go for a few hrs. in the morning then hang at the hotel at the pool in the afternoon before going back to the park at night - we have stayed off property in Orlando before and also in Fort Wilderness and doing that just wasn't so easy.

I didn't see one kid cry with the Mad Hatter. My 3 year loved him. We walked to the Aloha Show at the Polynesian. We had a two minute monorail ride to Magic Kingdom. 10 min. to Epcot. We had a car rental, so we drove to Animal Kingdom. We had the Park Hopper so we finished each day back at Magic Kingdom. We had Deluxe Dining Plan which covered every single meal, show and character meal. If you can do it...do it. Don't complain people. It is Disney. You are paying to stay on site. The pool is great and here is the bonus to being at the Floridian. If you have small children just pop back for a swim in the pool and then head back out. You are so close to everything. No cafeteria food here. Delicious salads, fruit and might I suggest the Lobster Eggs Benendict for breakfast at the Cafe Floridian. It has a 24 hr quick service. Perfect for late night munchies. We were in the Conch building and upgraded to a large suite. Beautiful. It was the building I was hoping to get. We could watch the fireworks from the dock or our patio.

Be sure you make reservations for the character meals. We were seated immediately as I heard families being told there was nothing available. My kid loved it and the food was great.

We accepted not really knowing what to expect. Since we were arriving rather late (11 pm) we were reluctant to let Disney's Magical Express Service because they promise the luggage THREE hours AFTER you arrive to the hotel and we knew we didn't want to be woken up at 1am by the bell boy. So instead we chose not to put the Magical Express tags on our luggage when we left home. We picked the luggage up ourselves in Orlando Airport then walked to the Magical Express counter on the other side of the airport to catch the free bus to the hotel. It worked out great. We had our luggage with us the whole time, we got a free ride (saved us $60 that we'd have to spend on the towncar/cab) and we didn't have to stay up longer then needed waiting for our luggage to arrive. For the ones that don't know what Magical Express is, here is a short summary: \"Disney's Magical Express Service is an airport service that offers hassle free, complimentary transportation from the Orlando International Airport to your Resort hotel, and then back again when your stay is over, for both you and your luggage. The magical part of this service is that if you utilize the Disney's Magical Express luggage tags provided, you do not have to claim your luggage when you arrive at the Orlando International Airport. Disney's Magical Express claims your luggage on your behalf and delivers it directly to your Walt Disney World\u00c2\u00ae Resort room. \" Grand Floridian was beautiful. It consists of little buildings that each seem to have 3 floors. We were given concierge building and a room with a balcony. There was a free complementary breakfast downstairs in our building that consisted of muffins, bagels and fruit. There was a coffee/cappuccino machine downstairs as well. The view from the balcony was fantastic - what they call water view. The rooms were clean and spacious with two double beds and a large TV/DVD player etc. Both my husband and I commented however, that even if the room was nice it just didn't seem to be worth $500+ that they charge for it. For that kind of money we would have expected high thread count sheets, duvet covers, some kind of luxury that goes beyond just basics. There was nothing magical about the suite or the hotel. Just like most deluxes we've seen (Beach Club, Yacht Club etc) it seems to be targeting the adult population. We were traveling with a 3 year old. Although pools were very nice and the wall paper in the hotel had Mickey and Minnie on it (my daughter loved that!) there was really nothing there that would remind you that you are in a Disney resort. There were no walking characters. Even towels were plain white. By the way I have never seen so many towels circulating like in this hotel. The pool has a free towel pick up/drop off station and I've seen many parents use pool towels to dry off their kids once, then get new ones. I've seen a little train with 2 wagons full of clean towels arriving at least 3 times during our pool stay. Pools are the highlight of this hotel. There are two of them and they are beautiful and open 24 hours!!! When we arrived (in the middle of the night) people were swimming and enjoying themselves and we had to be very strong not to succumb to the temptation and go swim right away instead of putting our toddler to bed. What a wonderful perk it is to be able to swim whenever you want to, even after the parks have closed. Magic Kingdom is across the lake and the view is magnificent. However the hotel itself seemed rather isolated to me. We're used to staying close to the Boardwalk or Downtown Disney and walking around at night. If we stayed the whole time at the Grand Floridian I have a feeling we'd be rather bored. There are few stores in the hotel, but we were not interested in anything other then Disney merchandise. The upstairs toy/souvenir store is wonderful with some unique merchandise that I didn't manage to find anywhere else (hooded Minnie and Mickey towels for toddlers come to mind). We managed to get breakfast reservations at the 1900 Park Fare (review below) so we got to eat at the hotel too. It was very convenient for us even if we did have free concierge breakfast in our building. The hotel has a mock beach. What it means is that it's a beach on the little lake (in between two pools) with canopies and umbrellas but you can't swim in the lake. I suppose that's because the water isn't clean or maybe because they want to use the lake for the little boats and don't want liability for accidents.The smaller pool is still plenty large and 3 ft deep. There is a kids pool next to it that is knee deep. The nicest part of it is the large wall clock that helps you keep track of time your toddler has been in the pool :) . The sundry store sells rather cheap buckets and shovels for the little ones (94 cents!) so there is very little chance your kid won't enjoy the kid pool and the fake beach. The other pool is larger and it has more intricate design. It is more difficult finding a space/chair/bed next to it, especially in the shade since it seems more popular. There are large cabanas available for rent by the pool (I think they are $120/day) with TV and mini fridge in each. I have never seen cabanas being rented by the hotel pool before. Overall we loved the hotel (especially since we were paying the moderate resort price for it) but didn't feel it would have been worth paying full price for it. There was very little difference between the Grand Floridian and the Dolphin where we continued our stay. We actually liked the location of the Dolphin better and found their beds to be more comfortable then the Grand Floridian beds. The only thing we missed at the Dolphin was the ceiling fan that we've gotten used to at the Floridian. Also we thought that Magical Express provided a great value (well, since it was basically a free bus ride from the airport to the hotel). Also, since we do lots of character dining it would have been beneficial for us to have been able to get the dining plan which Swan and Dolphin don't offer. But overall, we're happy to call Swan/Dolphin our home in Disney. 1900 Park Fare at the Grand Floridian (Alice in the Wonderland, Mad Hatter, Winnie the Pooh and Tigger) Our breakfast reservation was for 8:20 which was pretty early for us considering we arrived at the hotel at 11 pm. But we managed to pull ourselves out of the bed and show up for breakfast. The food was great if you like breakfast foods. It was all you can eat buffet. I especially liked that they had lower stations so that the kids could see the food and pick what they want to eat by themselves. They had scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausages, Danishes, pancakes, Mickey waffles, fresh fruit, different breads, bagels, muffins and my favorite hot bread pudding with vanilla sauce (they must cater to lots of Brits). It was the only place in Disney that has scrambled eggs with cheese. And the only place that I've seen make omelets on the spot with ingredients of your choice. One corky thing was that milk and butter had to be ordered from the server. The service was great, the orange juice was flowing and the characters moved swiftly. My daughter was absolutely terrified by the Mad Hatter who screamed and acted a little too much for our taste. He stole the show but I noticed a lot of little ones crying when he walked by their table. Alice was nice and lingered for a bit talking to our daughter. Winnie the Pooh and Tigger were gone in a blink, but it was a busy morning and they had lots of tables to visit. We had a much more leisurely visit with Pooh and friends during our lunch at the Crystal Palace in Magic Kingdom. I would always recommend going to lunch versus breakfast since food is better and you manage to skip the worst Florida heat.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cMy favourite hotel experience EVER\u201d", "Author": "Niamh86", "ReviewID": "UR14910129", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Floridian hotel for a week over New Years Eve 07.

I am pleased to report that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been more wrong about the Grand Floridian. We LOVED it.

The pool and slide were a blast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and may I just say that I have never seen so many lifeguards at a hotel pool.

While everything is above average or just great about the hotel, the added price is the convenience that Disney offers guests to attend the theme parks. As this allows advanced entry at parks in early morning or late at night, chances are that you're not going to be at the hotel much if that's the reason for going. Think of it (or any of the theme parks) as a $250-$300 night hotel with the extra price for the convenience of not having to travel so far home at the end of the day. We were at the theme parks for two days and as each park is completely draining, having a room relatively nearby will be worth it if some kids want to go on every ride all day long, while another (or the parents) start having sore feet around 3 p.m. Also, the resort hotels offer free bus connections to and from Orlando airport. No need for rental car if you're going to limit your stay to Disney. And generally, the knowledge that if something goes wrong for you during your trip, Disney goes out of its way to correct matters. That has more to do with the price than the room you're staying in. My room was very comfortable but hardly spacious. But the beds, TV, information package, soap and every minor detail was better than expected. The food at the Grand Floridian Cafe was probably the thing we most appreciated there. We ate out in the Disney Village the night before and the food was attrocious. The food at the sitdown Cafe (on the first floor) is tremendous at a slightly lesser price. The dishes served were great recipes, was healthy, had appropriate portions and the ingredients were top of the line. Not sure if it would be the kids favourite food, but one isn't going to get better at that price in a resort. Ultimately, if you want a Disney experience with the family, I would recommend this hotel over the Polynesian or Contemporary Hotels. And the best advice I heard from a Florida resident who goes to Disney at least once a year - \"Do your homework about the Disney experience before you go.

However we were only there 3 days so we opted to go for the Grand Floridian. Best choice we have ever made at Disney World! 1. We were enthralled by the towering tree in the lobby and delighted by the Giant Gingerbread house, which you can smell before you see it. 2. The staff was extremely accomodating, our luggage was lost by the airline and they offered to take us to town to get necessities, which was nice... especially that they didnt' force us to buy out of the gift shops. 3. This property has multiple places to eat, which, although some are more pricey, is more convenient than the Animal Kingdom (for example) which is so remote everyone eats meals there and you are stranded at the food court night after night because you didn't get a reservation....

The next room was barely a view, but we did not want to move again. The rooms are very modest, and the balcony was tiny. Then after all this fuss we were all thirsty, but the bar key was missing. We had to make several calls to the desk to finally get someone to come after close to an hour with a key so that we could spend some morre money on water! The room was very average...and not so clean. We found a pacifier near the bed, and gum on the bathroom floor - neither was ours (YUCK)!!! The front desk/concierge were never helpful or well-informed. We requested room service menus (again, to spend more money!) and they were never delivered. Once when we were coming home from the parks at 11pm the door to our part of the hotel was stuck. Our family, and several others, were stuck outside in the torrential rain until someone came to open it. We waited almost 30 minutes, after a long day in the parks, which we all felt was unacceptable. Breakfast was mediocre, and we never could get refills on our coffee! The shuttles took forever to come. The pools were O.K., albeit very crowded. Nothing spectacular. My husband and I have traveled extensively...both with and without children. Neither of us is particularly picky or high-maintenence Yet we both agreed that this was our worst hotel experience ever. This is unfortunate, as the Grand Floridian is very expensive!

Although I have stayed numerous times at 5 star hotels I had never spent so much on a hotel per night so I was hoping that this would be spectacular. The room was a very pretty traditional style room but was a bit small. The view at night of the fireworks was spectacular even though we were told we did not have a magic kingdom view. The grounds were our favorite. One of the pools were closed for construction but that did not matter since the other pool was really nice with a waterslide and cute bar and cabana area. Right beyond the pool was an area of sand and the lake. Really, really, pretty! You did not feel like you were in Florida, felt more like a tropical island. The lobby was a very open pretty space with an old world feel. Although we were happy with everything else the restaurants and room service menu need some fixing. The first night there we ate at citrico's with our daughter and another couple. The portions were very small and only one of us were happy with our food. When I asked for bread, oddly enough the waiters whole cheery personality changed to him almost having an attitude. We all noticed it and thought it was strange. It was also very expensive. We also ate the next evening in the grand floridian cafe and thought it had a very limited menu and was quite expensive for what it was. The grill that was open 24 hours was very convienent and had a nice variety although that was expensive also. Forget about the room service menu, the prices were ridiculous. The convience of the hotel was a huge plus it was only one stop on the monorail to magic kingdom and one boat ride stop away. Loved the boat ride back at night while the fireworks were going off.

From the moment I walked in, I was disappointed. The lobby was lovely but did not have the Disney wow factor that my kids love (nothing Disney, childfriendly going on). The atmosphere was boring and dull with the band playing only sporatically and the bars dead. The room was not in the main hotel and was quite a walk away. Average hampton inn style room with pleasant view. The pool was under construction. The kid camp was depressing and not well staffed. The game room and cafeteria were small, dingy and actually the worse I have ever seen on a disney property. The breakfast in the buffet was cafeteria quality in both atmosphere and food and in the main restaurant a total rip off and again very institutional tasting. What was most shocking was how poorly trained the staff was. I had an important dinner booked at Animal Kindgom Lodge. I called concierge TWICE to confirm how to get there and I was told NOT to take monorail to Magic Kingdom then bus to Animal Kingdom Lodge a I thought but to take monorail to transportaion center. When I got to transportaiton center I was told no busses to the lodge only to the resort. ugh. I had to get back on monorail and go all around again. The mistake cost me forty minutes and I missed my meal. Also, DESPITE PAYING ALMOST 400 A NIGHT NO CABLE OR MOVIE CHANNELS. When I called to complain, they told me, and this is a quote, Disney wants you out enjoying disney amenities NOT watching tv. When I explained that it was 10:00 at night, I just drove for five hours, and I had two infant children, they didn't know how to respond. Apparently, the lack of a cable package is a common complaint because at my business meeting the next day I heard others venting similar frustration. (NOTE to Disney, if you are going to bill this as an adult friendly, business orientated hotel, you need to have cable) Finally, I think it is outrageious to spend 400 a night and not be able to book a dinner reservation in your hotel at any time for any night of your stay! The spa: outrageous prices, mediocre services In sum, not inspiring, not luxury, not fun for the kids, showing its age, a big disappointment.

While the common ares are impressive, the rooms are average. However, if you're traveling to the Magic Kingdom, this is a solid - if relatively pricey - choice. After staying there for a few nights I realized that most folks who were there wanted to stay at the top Disney hotel but were still vacationing on a budget. Disney is, smartly, able to meet the demand for \"deluxe\" accommodations while still on a family budget by providing fairly nice common areas with fairly common private areas. The rooms in the Grand Floridian are slightly above average. They are on par with a slightly better than average Hilton, Sheraton, etc. My room had a flat panel television, comfortable beds, and a decent bathroom. The furnishings were a bit dated. Naturally this is a family hotel with extremely high occupancy. As such, don't be surprised if there is a crying baby next door or young children running down the hall. Moreover, if you're a light sleeper, expect to hear them. The walls aren't that thick. The bathroom is stocked with Disney style \"resort\" toiletries. There are plenty of towels and they are of acceptable quality. The maids do an excellent job. There's a nightly turn-down of the bed. Most of the rooms in the hotel aren't in the \"main\" hotel. At first I thought we were getting the short end of the stick being sent to a separate building. However, it turned out we were right on the water with a perfect view of the nightly fireworks, the Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom, and the other resorts. If you need internet access, it's available via ethernet. They provide a cable in the closet, but I didn't see any signs of wifi. The access cost a nominal amount and was very reliable. The hotel is serviced by the Disney World Monorail. The Magic Kingdom is one stop away. Epcot takes a bit longer. Buses will take you to the rest of the attractions. Also, during warm weather the onsite attractions at the hotel are excellent. They have two great pools, a marina, reservable cabanas, a beach, etc. That aspect of the hotel is very well done. Eating at the hotel is a bit rough. Unlike most hotels, just about everyone staying at the hotel wants to eat there (or at some other Disney facility). ...and everyone wants to eat at the same time. As such, if you want anything other than quick-serve burgers / chicken strips type meals you need to make a reservation well in advance of your visit. The food is generally good, but nothing incredible. We took the youngsters with us to the character dinner in the hotel. They enjoyed it; but don't expect a glamorous event. It's like a zoo-like cafeteria atmosphere with characters stopping by your table. Finally, if you stay at this hotel don't get bamboozled into buying a Disney Dinning Plan unless you're a family of big eaters. The plan is complicated, cumbersome, and generally didn't seem to be a good deal.

Here are the pros and cons of our trip: PROS: -Check-In-Because we were driving up from Naples (approx. 3 hours) we wanted to arrive early to get as much time at the Magic Kingdom. The GF allowed us to check in as early as 7AM and provided a secured placed for our luggage until the room was ready. Upon check in we were informed that we were being upgraded to a conciege level room. The conciege level rooms (levels 3 and 4 in the main building) allow you to have food, drinks, wine and champagne from 7AM to 10PM. Also, you have two full time private conciege desks to tend to your every need. If you can afford conciege level, I highly recommend it. -After we left for the Magic Kingdom (the next stop from the GF off the monorail) we recieved a phone call at 11:30 that our room was ready. -Our room was beautiful, newly renovated. Flat screen tv's, private bath seperate from marble topped double sinks, whamsetta bedding on two queen (not full) sized beds, private balcony, refridg., large ironing board, robes, dvd player, IPOD docking station, H2O plus spa products and couch. -The hotel had a private New Years Eve party with a live band and dance floor in the grand hall. At 12:00 they covered the room in balloons and gave out champagne (conciege guest had all liquor free). -The hotel sits between the Magic Kingdom and Epcot so you can watch both fire works at night like you are actually at the parks. It is much more comfortable then being in the croweded park. -The spa services were fabulous. Just add about $25 onto your normal spa services at home. Example: A $110 message would be about $135 at GF. CONS: PRICE: I called in September to make reservations for New Years. I was told that I would have to pay holiday rates for a standard room which was $700.00 a night for a $385.00 room during the regular season. I could not believe the difference in price. SERVICE: All the lower level employees were wonderful (valet, bellhops, maids and servers. The people I was most dissapointed with were the conciege and management level employees. Like many reviews before mine I found that they had a bit of a chip on their shoulders. I bit of an attitude was displayed. When I complained they just said, \"well, it is the holidays\"..........WTF? TRANSPORTATION: The GF does not have any private transportation. You must take either the monorail or disney bus to other resorts which can pose a problem. We wanted to go to Downtown Disney and it took 30 minutes to get there and 50 minutes to get back. I was so disgusted by this and if you are someone who does not like public transportation, get your rental or car out of valet and drive to other places. NOISE: If you are a sleeper make sure you ask for a more private room. Even though the best rooms are in the main building they can be the noisiest. You can hear all the activites from the main floor in your room and the maid even comes at 8:30. Just make sure you ask for a private hallway room if you are going to stay in the main building. I hope this review and our pictures help you make your choice of Disney hotels.

Decided to leave the hotel we were at to have a more traditional 'Disney' experience and the Grand Floridian provided the experience. We travelled with 3 young children under 6 and they loved the experience in the hotel. It was very child friendly which was a surprise considering it to be one of the better places to stay WDW. Upon arrival you head through a security gate where they issue you with a parking pass. We decided to valet ($10 per day) or you can self park but the walk is across the street from the main hotel. The valet parking and luggage service is very efficient and we were taken care of instantly. Walking into the hotel you are presented with a grand high ceiling that is several floors up surrounded by open balconies. As it was Christmas they had a live band playing every night and the most enormous Christmas tree imaginable. The systems at the hotel are highly automated so if there is a glitch with your reservation be prepared to spend some time as they try to fix it. In my case, my two children were listed as adults so we could not get our Theme Park tickets added to them. A minor issue, however, I had to spend 15 minutes waiting for them to fix it which in the end they could not do so. I offered to just buy the Theme Park tickets separately but in their attempt to provide an awesome experience they spend too much time fixing a minor issue. The staff and very attentive and focused on service and everyone ends their sentence with 'Have a magical day'. In the beginning I kind of liked this, however, after one experience where we tried to order a movie from the TV in our room and were told by the guest services person that they do not have any premium channels in the room followed by the 'Have a magical day' - it started to ring a little hollow. However, this is Disney World and I am prepared to suspend natural cynicism. The room although pricey ($579 per night), was an average size but with 2 queens, a flat screen TV, double sinks in the bathroom and very nicely appointed. The beds had duvets and were comfortable if a little on the soft side. Our room was a 'garden view' which is an entry level option but it had a balcony with a very nice view overlooking the courtyard. The hotel has two great swimming pools that were nice and warm and at least one of them is open 24 hours * 7 Days a week which our kids were really happy about. The monorail is very convenient to get you to the park and our kids loved the journey. One of the nice things staying at a Disney Resort is that anything you purchase in the park gets charged to the room. Nice and convenient. I rated the experience as 'Above Average' rather than Excellent due to the 'automated' service (described above) but also for things like we wanted to know when the kids club operated, rather than provide a simple answer they spend 60 seconds looking for an extension where an automated voice provided the answer. The hotel uses technology well but I think it takes away from some personal service that it sometimes nice to get. The robotic nature of the highly programmed staff is sometimes annoying as they do not deviate from the standard even when things are going wrong.

Dual sinks and a huge mirror are available for others. Surprisingly, even a clothes hamper was supplied - a nice touch! Disney does offer nice soaps, conditioners and lotions, but I really like the smell of the soap at the Grand Floridian. The kids enjoyed the i-pod docking station/radio.

The lake was our main view, just able to see Space Mountain and parts of other rides, but not the castle. A bit noisy at night, but hey, this is Disney!! Despite being here before there are still things we have not tried, and Citrico's was one of them. I have to say it was one of the best meals of the holiday and one of the best in the overall Florida area. We were not rushed, we had a very pleasant server, the food was of high standard for all courses and we had a lovely view of the fireworks at 10pm. from over the lake. Nice atmospheric restaurant, quite busy, but we felt feeling very satisfied with our overall experience. Well worth the $175 price for a tasty and flavoursome dining experience, which included a cocktail and wine. We also had tea in the Garden Tea rooms. A feast of sandwiches, trifle, fresh cream scones and home made jam tarts, washed down by sparkling wine and a strawberry and of course loads of tea, with once more great unobtrusive service. The pool was popular, well kept and looked lovely by night, well lit and well used. Gardens immaculate, intermingled by reindeer that lit up at night. The flowers in the main building were just amazing, smelling fresh and changed every other day. Of course location is great, one stop from MK and a boat ride away on the return, although one day there were a few complaints on the return journey as some problem or other meant the boats were every half an hour or so, meaning long queues and no gurantee of a seat. We took the monorail back! Casparillos Grill was great if you wanted a snack, hot or cold, with seating inside or out, overlooking the lake and fireworks at night. Suiting all tastes, there was something for everyone, and whilst not our first choice of dining, this is great and serves a purpose of a quick coffee for breakfast with a pastry or a hurried lunch on the way to a park - open 24 hours a day. People complain about the stuffiness, poor attitude of staff, uncleanliness, noise etc. We never encounter any of this. We understand this is a busy international hotel in one of the worlds most popular tourist destinations - things do go wrong and people have bad days; kids scream, things get overlooked - remember where you are! We, as always, found the atmosphere relaxed, everything well maintained, all the service we received was of high standard, room was what we were used to, food just great, grounds welcoming right down to the same old man who has been welcoming us and wishing us a Grand Day for the last 10 years, still at the door!! The hotel overall is of a high standard, full of Disney Magic, set in an authentic Victorian era with modern day service and amenities. Great location, all the food in all the restaurants is of a good standard, some very high. We had a brilliant (I cannot say relaxing - we walked twice round the world it seemed!!) time and cannot wait to return once more to our Disney Home, in a couple of years!!", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExpensive but another good experience\u201d", "Author": "KESinNJ", "ReviewID": "UR11531808", "Content": "We just returned, staying at the Grand Floridian from 12/1 - 12/9. You will be paying a premium over non Disney hotels offsite, but if you have younger kids being on-site really is special. We have now stayed at the Contemporary, Yacht Club and Grand Floridian and several off-site hotels (Grand Cypress Villas, Gaylord Palms, and the Marriott World Center). For all around value, the Cypress Grand Villas are the best. You basically have 2-3 bedroom villas on a golf course 5 minutes from Disney. They have been recently renovated and versus Disney deluxe hotels are 40% less and much more comfortable. The Grand Floridian was OK, but even my kids (12 & 9) are starting to see way too many changes in how guests are handled. First two weeks of December are supposed to be slow, this was not the case this time. They are always looking for ways to make money, we went to Very Merry Christmas parade twice and basically for 8 days for basic tickets and the two nights for the parades we paid over $1,500 just for tickets. When I totaled up the trip you find yourself spending over $10,000 for a family of four. I could go on a number of vacations for half that amount and stay in equal or better accommodations. You need to experience inside the park with your family and it is worth it one time. I think we are at the point where we just don't see the reason to pay almost twice what you would pay outside Disney since they really don't do anything special except provide the atmosphere. Disney Restaurant Food is getting more and more plain and just so overpriced. I don't want to single out the restaurants, but we ate at many of them and the food was just not anywhere near as good as outside the park and always cost more. The best deal we found with great food at very fair prices was Earl Sandwich in Downtown Disney. All of us loved the breakfast and found ourselves looking forward to each morning knowing the dinners at Disney were sub-par at best even though we paid $100-$200 each night for dinner. We ate at seven Disney restaurants this time and I have to say none of them were good - average food at inflated prices. I am not down on Disney, we will go back since the kids love the environment, but we are at a point if we stay inside it would only be at the Grand Floridian, but likely we will be staying outside the park since they just charge way too much for accommodations that are just OK. Last point to mention is we are fortunate to have the economics, but I have always been taught not to waste money. I don't mind paying a premium for premium food quality, but paying a premium and getting average food quality is just not smart. Disney should really change the approach on food. If you stay on property try to get the meal plan, we overpaid and people told us at least with the meal plan you control the amount you overpay. The staff really do try to help, you can just see the changes over the years from the Disney Magic to now it is really treated as business first and you see that at every turn.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cLiked But Didn't Love!\u201d", "Author": "Cori1124", "ReviewID": "UR11234165", "Content": "I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Grand Floridian hours ago. This was my 7th visit in 3 years & after only staying in Value & Moderate Disney hotels in the past, I was looking forward to not just a deluxe Disney hotel...but THE ULTIMATE DELUXE DISNEY HOTEL. Unfortunately, i was a little disappointed. We started off on the wrong foot...we paid $551 a night for the \"Theme Park View\" and was given a room with a huge tree in our line of sight. We called the front desk immediately & managed to get our room changed. I was & still am furious that after paying such an astronomical amount per night for a view of the Magic Kingdom, the Grand Floridian tried to pass off a room that clearly did not have one. Regardless, the new room had an AWESOME view & we are so grateful to Nancy at the front desk for all her efforts to rectify the situation. Anyway...you know the old saying \"be careful what you wish for.\" Despite reading complaints of noisy train whistles & ferry horns from others who had a Magic Kingdom view, we assumed they were being too critical. We learned first hand how noisy it can be. From the howling of the wolves at the Haunted Mansion to the sound checks at 6:30am in Magic Kingdom along with the ferry horns & train whistles, our room wasn't exactly peaceful. I will say that the view of the fireworks from our balcony ROCKED though a lot of guests weren't recognizing the new non-smoking policies & were smoking on theirs. Personally, it didn't bother me but I can certainly see how it could bother others. Regardless, the staff went above & beyond to recognize my birthday (no thanks to my mother) & even if it wasn't, I believe that the staff would treat you just as special. I found the monorail to be tedious considering we were the last stop when coming back from Magic Kingdom as well as for the buses to Animal Kingdom & MGM. Going to Magic Kingdom was quite easy though I wish I could say the same for the other parks. The lobby was beautiful, however, you're constantly dodging people who aren't even guests who are taking a peak at the hotel or have reservations at one of the restaurants. We had a pet cockroach whom we affectionately named Walter who would sometimes hold us hostage in our room while he hung out on our balcony.

We had two toddlers (15 month old twins) with us and this was our first visit to Disneyworld. The cons : (1) The room was in building 7 and not the main building which is featured on the website. When we booked we were not told that there were multiple buildings, so we were a little disappointed when we found ourselves trudging to the end of the property and away from the spectacular main building. (2) Our room faced a small pond and the monorail - not what you would expect for the cost. (3) The room itself was just too small. We had a tough time fitting in the two cribs and two suitcases and had to end up putting one crib in the dressing room adjoining the bathroom and the other in the corridor near the entrance. The bathroom was tiny and basic. (3) The decor was quite unattractive and old looking -unmatching wallpaper, drapes, upholstery and a rough carpet - again not what I expected for these prices. (4) Housekeeping never refilled tissue paper, soaps, lotions, and tea bags. (5) Room service food was ridiculously overpriced and pretty bad. We ordered the fish of the day ($26) and the crab cake appetizer ($10). The dish consisted of a 3 inch long piece of salmon and 3-4 pieces of asparagus. And that's it. No rice, or any other accompaniment in a $26 dollar dish. They did give bread with the meal - which was cold, hard and inedible. The food choices were pretty limited too. (6) The bus ride to Animal Kingdom took about 45 mins including the wait and the multiple stops. So if you want to go to the other parks that are not on the monorail I would recommend staying near those as all the bus rides were hellishly long. Now for the pros: (1) The cafe had a good breakfast - i.e. not hideously expensive eggs etc. (2) You could buy wine and beer from this cafe and it was affordable. (3) You could watch the fireworks over the castle from the hotel. (4) The hotel lobby in the main building is spectacular (5) The balconies on the second floor overlooking the beach are a great hang-out spot.

The Magic Kingdom is within view from \"magic Kingdom view\" rooms and the beach...these are great spots to see the nightly fireworks and water pageant.

Delicious food, outstanding service, and romantic ambience was what made Victoria and Alberts an excellent dining experience. There was only a few negatives....their was only one hot tub which can get pretty crowded. The hot tub also needs a bit of a makeover with its old chipped tile. The rooms are very nice but I would suggest not getting a dormer (or attic) room. We were on the 4th floor in Boca Chica and we had a dormer room. The room has vaulted ceilings and is a bit smaller than regular rooms but the main complaint was the balcony was very small. If you plan to enjoy your balcony, do not have a dormer room. We didn't request another room because it was not that much of a problem...but in the future if we return to Grand Floridian (and I would), I will request not having the dormer room.

All the complaints about all the money grabbing, and commercialisation, its Disney World!! What do you expect?? And you should always check things such as refurbishing / building work before going anywhere. Firstly let me say after arriving at the hotel (after a long journey from West Yorkshire!) you're greeted with the most pleasant, attentive staff. On your walk in there's a great old chap, dressed up to welcome you or wish you a nice day - nice touch. The reception staff are the same. Each time we have requested a lagoon view room and have been granted one. Even the concierge desk cannot do enough for you, ringing you back promptly and checking you have booked to see everything you want to, from shows to dining in one of the parks. MAKE USE OF THIS SERVICE!!! If you leave it until going to the parks and try to get into a great restaurant at lunch - you'll more than likely have to wait. The rooms are good. Ok, they're a decent size. Admittedly there's nothing extra special or unique to give it the 5* class feel, but the beds...... they are without a doubt the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in. Everytme i stay here i have the best night's sleep of my entire life. I normally wake 3-4 times a night - here i sleep soundly. Maybe its due to the fact the staff come in and turn down the beds for you, dim the lights, leave chocolates on your pillow with a sweet dreams message. Also a good balcony. I found the room service great. Quick, the longest i waited i think was 35mins. And the best food......the infamous cobb salad, steaks....its amazing. And the table is all laid with tablecloth for you. Nice touch. I must also say i've dined in Victoria and Alberts restaurant 3 times now. And wow. It must be the equivalent of our 3 michelin star rating. I cannot begin to describe this place. The food, service, even down to the lighting, the rose they give to the ladies, and the personalised menus. It truly is an unforgettable experience. (although i'd recommend leaving the children in the musketeers club!) We had a 6 year old with us and the dinner usually lasts just short of 3 hours - a long time for a child to sit. Yes its expensive - but you get what you pay for - you must make this part of your holiday. The grand floridian cafe is also good - for breakfast or lunch. Or there's a quick grab and go place for those wanting to get out and about. I must say narcooses, the seafood restaurant is also out of this world.....as are their pina coladas!! Great seafood, fresh and with beautiful settings - try to book at night when the fireworks come on, there's an outside balcony you can go watch from - superb. Citricos is also a nice, less formal restaurant. The pool areas are fantastic, with the lifeguard for the children. And the great hot tub/jacuzzi. Must say though - one slight problem here. You pay a lot of money to stay in this fabulous hotel, and it's extremely irritating to be sat in the hot tub, with a group of loud, drinking men, boasting about the fact they've snuck in and using the facilities for free. Annoying. And intimidating. There should be more checks on things like that. All in all i must say its an unforgettable experience. Granted, the rooms and some decor is not all 5* luxury (although refurbishment is happening right now). I am returning at the new year when the refurbishment has finished so will possibly be changing this comment. Oh, and the afternoon tea - amazing. As is the spa.

We have also stayed at Yacht and beach Club & Swan and Dolphin. First off..this hotel deserves all of its designations and accolades. The hotel itself is beautiful inside and out. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. I was concerned that some things may have slipped by reading previous reviews...but here is my take. The Grand Floridian is celebrating 20 years next year so they are upgrading. There is some construction going on but nothing that bothered my family. The rooms were well appointed and decently sized. We had 2 adults and 3 kids and were very comfortable in the room. I think all rooms are very well located and convenient to one thing or another. For example...if you are really close to the mono rail you may be a little farther away from the pool. The entire resort is beautiful and clean. By next year all of the rooms will be upgraded. We stayed in a non-refurbished (older) room and found it to be of excellent quality. It was promptly and professionally cleaned each day. The GF is very kid friendly. the only thing that would not be considered kid friendly is Victoria and Albert's. The pools, lobby, gift shops, etc are all geared towards families. Overall, you get exactly what you pay for. This hotel is crisp in ambiance and amenities. GF is finely tuned for families who have a greater appreciation for nicer things. If you are spending your last dime to go to Disney you should not spend it on the GF. You will get the same \"Disney experience\" at other resorts for less cost.

Even after I went and complained about how unclean our room they still didn't respond. We were told they were going to do a VIP cleaning. All they did was change the ripped shower curtain and make some towell animals. The hand prints were all still there as we checked out after our 10 day stay.

After staying at the Wilderness Lodge on 5 previous visits(All were fantastic visits), my family and I decided to try a new hotel at Disney and opted to go to the Grand Floridian. At check-in at the hotel, I made several requests to the clerk....A room in a quiet location...not near an elevator, not near an ice machine, not near a housekeeping closet, no connecting door to another room, etc. I emphasized to the clerk that my family and I were light sleepers and would really need a quiet location. Well, none of my requests were granted. The room was located in the back of the Sago Cay building. It was right by the monorail which was a short distance from the room, there was a connecting door, the room was in an open area of the building where all noise could be heard. We were assured by the baggage person and another employee that this would be a quiet room. Well, this was not the case. Much noise could be heard from the hallway, the family in the next room was screaming for about 20 minutes at 12:30AM(Could hear the entire conversation through the connecting door), At 3:30-4:00 AM we were awakened by the \"beeping\" noises of trucks going down a road. Turned out to be we were right by the main entrance/exit for trucks and other vehicles to enter and exit the property. Also, the A/C was not working properly after one feeble attempt to repair it in the late evening. The next morning, I angrily went down to the front desk to tell them of our problems and requested an immediate room change. The room change was granted but we had to go back to our room immediately, repack our belongings and wait for our luggage to be transferred to storage for the day. This was a major inconvenience. When we returned from the park at 3:00 PM that afternoon, we were advised that our room was still not ready. At this point, I finally encountered an employee that had some common sense and was helpful. Dana(Manager) deserves special credit. She immediately found us a new room in the Conch Key building which was a fantastic room. She also had some nice extras sent to us for our youngest daughter's B-Day(plate of chocolate, a large white chocolate Mickey, cookies) and our anniversary(small bottle of sparkling wine). Beautiful hotel. 2 nice pools, one of which had a nice waterslide for the kids. Easy access to get to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot by monorail. The bus service to MGM was horrible. The Grand Floridian shares bus service with the Polynesian and Contemporary Hotels. Had to wait a minimum of 25-30 minutes for the bus and had to stand on the bus also. Waaaaay too crowded. On one occasion, after 25 minutes the bus arrived and was too crowded to board. Had to wait an additional 25 minutes that time. Why in the world do 3 of the most expensive hotels at Walt Disney share bus service? Eating at the Grand Floridian is certainly not cheap. The only somewhat affordable option is Gasparilla's which is open 24 hours and has counter service. The other restaurants are extremely pricey.....Grand Floridian Cafe only has character breakfasts and character dinners, Victoria and Albert's has a prix fixe menu for $165 per person, Citrico's and Narcoosee's entrees average about $30 per entree. Overall, we loved our new room(nice size, newly renovated and in a nice quiet location, the pools were great, the health club(no charge for guests) was large and immaculate, the service was mediocre at best, very pricey restaurants at the resort, easy access by monorail to the MK and Epcot, poor bus service to MGM which really needs to be improved considering the price of a room at the Grand Floridian.

I can't begin to thank him (and the other concierge staff as well) for the attentive service and arrangements he made for my family when a difficult situation arose. Even in our room assignment, the staff made sure this was a memorable experience and honored my room request.

There had been a very large conference at the start of our stay which included many young recruits for one of the larger financial/accountancy firms - so between work - the pool took on a sort of frat party feel - with large cases of beer and lots of non- Disney language - not really suitable for the kids.

My review is of my most recent stay at the 5-star resort called Grand Floridian. We booked 4 nights here at the end of June for our Wedding/Reception. The wedding and reception are beyond the scale of 10, but my review of Grand Floridian is based on what I've experienced during my last few days as a Ms. and a day as a Mrs. _____ Overview: We stayed here (almost the whole wedding party) because this was where my reception was going to be located (at the Grand Ballroom). We were married at the Wedding Pavilion and were upgraded on our wedding night to the Honeymoon suite room. This review is not just based off the hotel itself, but the management and staff. _____ Pros: As many have mentioned already, this is a 5-star resort that is filled with shops and restaurants. If you want the complete \"Disney magical experience\" then this place will not disappoint. The children will love it and the parents will love the convenience of the monorail and proximity to Magic Kingdom. - This is by far the cleanest hotel I've ever been to. The hotel has several buildings filled with hotel rooms and every time we entered one it always smelled fresh and clean - The front desk was superb. They surely do treat you excellent here. The lady who handled all our room reservations (10 rooms) took the time to make sure everything was accommodated for us for my big day. - Everywhere we went, people were congratulating us. All of the bellmen, wait staff, front desk and maids would all tell us congratulations and best wishes. They did it with a smile too. Not many hotels have people that actually 'smile' at their customers. - Excellent bell service. They took care of our tons upon tons of luggage and packages for the wedding and everything was up at the room less than a minute after we got to our rooms. - The rooms were spacious and well-organized. We easily fit all my bridesmaids, our stylists, my mom and my grandmother and people coming in and out during the morning of my wedding with no problem. - We had an excellent view of the castle from our balcony. Fireworks were right there and we were able to see the magical lights parade on the water (I think they do this every night, they did it every night we were there, but I don't remember seeing it at the Contemporary Resort) - Beds were very comfortable. The only complaint is that I couldn't get people off my bed! :) - The perfect location for those wishing to visit Magic Kingdom. You just board the monorail and you are at MK. Very convenient. _____ Cons: Here's the part I warned you about. Keep in mind that this was supposed to be for our \"perfect day.\" This is a 5-star resort and therefore they should have adhered to their \"5-star\" status. - If you don't valet park, you have to park across the street. It's a good 7-8 minute walk back to the hotel, and then you have to travel to your specific building, which for us took another 4 minutes. When you have to go back and forth several times it does get irritating. - The bathroom was average (our honeymoon suite bathroom was an exception, it was great)...for a 5-star, I was expecting something better than an ordinary tub. This didn't fit the theme of the Grand Floridian at all. - You can actually hear people in the next room. We heard our relatives laughing out loud at something they were watching and we were nearly shocked. The walls aren't paper-thin, but be prepared to hear people who either talk loudly or laugh out loud. - I've read other reviews on here about their food. I'm sorry, but for the amount of food you get, the prices are NOT worth it. A meal with 2 entrees and 2 drinks at dinner cost us over $120 after tip. And I was still hungry! It doesn't take a whole lot to fill me up, but even I was disgusted at the tiny portions of food. To top it off, the server didn't even acknowledge that we were getting married/just married at all. We were actually shocked as both times we had dinner at the resort they didn't seem to care when everyone else had been extraordinarily friendly about it. - Post wedding day we were at Animal Kingdom to come back to our room to find one of our wedding presents broken on the floor. No one was in our room (as we were the only two with the keys) except maid service. Apparently, she knocked over our wedding gift (which was a ceramic eagle statue that holds salt/pepper glass shakers, all were broken) off the table as she was changing the bed sheet. Was there a note? Nope. Did she bother to pick up the pieces off the floor, as they laid there shattered? Nope. Nothing whatsoever. I called down to the front desk and they connected me to management. Management asks what happened and I told her. First she didn't sound convinced, like I was lying. Then she asked how much it was worth. How was I supposed to know that? It was a wedding present, something that was given to us. She offered a $20 credit to our stay. That's all. No apology, no argument, nothing. I told her I didn't agree but she said there was nothing else they could do. As if that weren't enough, we were due at the airport the next morning to catch our flight from OIA to Hawaii for our honeymoon vacation. They lost our reservations for traveling on their shuttle. No shuttle for us. We juggled around, talked to the front desk, called their hotline, everything. Our reservations (and we even gave them the reservation number) were no where to be found. And since they were booked they couldn't offer us a ride on their shuttle that we were supposed to be on in the first place. And here's the third and the cake topper incident. My aunt was staying next door to us and already had her 5 nights paid. Reservation was set months ago (back in January) and she paid then because Disney requires it upfront. As she was checking out, they demanded that she pay for that fifth night. She showed them the paper with the reservation that said it was all paid for and they printed out a paper from the computer saying that she only paid for 4 nights. After an hour of talking with management and trying to figure out what went wrong, my aunt and uncle were so furious that they had the reservation all set and showed that it was paid for while management was accusing them of fraud. Even after my aunt and uncle returned back home, they continued to harass them by leaving messages on their phone about how they need to pay for that fifth night. My aunt was crying to my mom (who is a cast member for Disney) and they even threatened my mom's job over this matter! As of this day today (remember I was married at the end of June) the issue is still unresolved and still being worked on. A major inconvenience for me and my wedding guests. _____ Recommend? Yes and no. I recommend for those that want the Disney experience and want to be close to Magic Kingdom. There are a TON of kids running around so if you don't like kids or don't want to hear screaming everywhere then this is certainly not the place for you. I don't recommend the regular rooms at all for any romantic getaways or honeymooners. If you are here for that matter, then get a honeymoon suite. It is very expensive ($950) but if you are going to stay at Grand Floridian go all out on the extra services and amenities you get for booking in one of their prestige rooms. I am utterly and completely disappointed in the management of the hotel. The cast members and staff were great, but if you have an issue with the higher-ups, prepare for a lot of trouble. I've read earlier reviews here as well that this seems to be a norm for management at this resort. It was such a mess and disgust to deal with. Who needs the extra stress on what is supposed to be their best day ever? If it weren't for the fantastic wedding and reception I had, I would be tearing apart Disney for almost ruining my experience with my aunt/uncle and inconveniencing the bride and groom on some matters. Sorry this review is so long. I wanted to share my personal experience here so you have an idea. Of course, there are going to be those people that say oh! This is the best resort ever. It is a very nice one...but the management needs a serious reality check in how to treat their guests. My aunt and uncle are never staying at Disney again, and they travel a lot with their kids.

Same building but on the other side. It was wonderful in the morning to overlook the lagoon and in the evening if we were in our room to see the fireworks while sitting on our balconey. The large pool is certainly sufficient for the number of guests in the hotel and is never really full. The kids pool is wonderful even for adults who enjoy the slide and the \"beach.\" The 24 hour take out and snack restaurant is a lifesaver for something quick and easy. We have not eaten at the Victoria and Albert but every other dining experience in the hotel was exceptional. Because we have been to DisneyWorld previously, we spent more time at the hotel than last year. Even if you don't leave the grounds you will enjoy being at a first class resort (albeit with lots and lots of kids) with all the of the amenities one would expect from a five star hotel. A nice feature for families is that each lodge is equipped with a laundry room. When I couldn't get the soap dispensor to spit out the little box, I went to the coincerge who immediately had complimentary boxes of detergent and bleach sent to our room.

The lobby is bright and cheery and often has live entertainment (small orchestra or piano). Everything at this resort is first class, including the two swimming pools and the restaurants. I have stayed in all the Disney resorts but two (Animal Kingdom Lodge, Contemporary Resort) and this is certainly the fanciest, and the most expensive. This was my second stay at the Grand Floridian. I was originally booked into the Animal Kingdom Lodge, but Disney moved me to GF because of some construction going on at AK Lodge. I wasn't disappointed. The rooms here are larger than at the other properties, the bedding more plush, the towels large and fluffy. One great thing about staying at GF (or at the Polynesian Resort) is that there is an (unannounced) parade on the lagoon each evening just after dark. If your room faces the water, you can see it from there. Lighted floats head by the resort with brightly lit images. This time, the images were first from Little Mermaid, and then there were a variety of patriotic images and songs. Very nice! Getting to Magic Kingdom is very convenient from here (or from Polynesian or Contemporary) because the monorail takes you right there. Epcot has a direct bus or a monorail connection. There are direct buses to the other theme parks. There are two pools. I used the larger one, and it was much larger than needed for the number of people. There were also a kids pool and the largest whirlpool I've seen at a resort. After a long day in the parks, the swimming and the whirlpool were just what the doctor ordered! On a previous visit, I dined at Victoria and Alberts, the very expensive and very nice gourmet restaurant. This time we ate at the Cafe, which was still fairly expensive but very good. The service was impeccable. I got a special deal beause they transerred me from Animal Kingdom. I would have paid much more if I had booked there directly. Frankly, for me, other resorts are better from a value perspective. The Wilderness Lodge, Beach Club, Yacht Club, Boardwalk are just about as nice and much less expensive. Of course, the theme parks are the main reason to come to Disney. From that persective, the value resorts (All Star or Pop Century) are just fine. They offer transportation options that are just as good as the very expensive Grand Floridian, except that the cheaper places don't have the monorail to the Magic Kingdom. Overall, though, my favorite Disney resort is Port Orleans French Quarter. It's the smallest resort in the park and very charming.

First let me state that many of the cast members here were great, but overall there are some serious problems. There has recently been problems at the monorail resorts with theft near the pools (this was confirmed by a number of cast members at the resort, although management refuses to acknowledge this fact). When we had our camera stolen the management refused to comment, refused to help with anything other than filling out a \"lost item report.\" We had another one overnighted to us and the desk assured us they would call as soon as it arrived. They did not. When we phoned the desk to see if it had come we were told it had not. We then called the delivery service only to find out that our package had been signed for by the hotel. When we phoned the hotel again they said that they would locate the package. This was a very stressful and time consuming event. I would think that a resort of this caliber would have had much better customer service. We had also booked a Disney Cruise and checked in with the cruise desk. The person there assured us that all would be taken care of. When we arrived in the terminal we found that nothing had been taken care of and had to wait in line to check in.

You could not have better accessibility to the parks. Only a short ( 5 minutes max) ride to Magic Kingdom and about 10-15 minute ride back via monorail, my favorite way of Disney transportation. You are connected with the Contemporary Resort, where I strongly advise you go for breakfast at Chef Mickey's, along with the Polynesian and the Transportation and Ticket Center (where you can transfer to a monorail that takes you to Epcot). I am spoiled and am not a fan of the buses, but you can take one to Animal Kingdom, MGM studios, the Disney water-parks, downtown disney and other Disney properties, including the Boardwalk (taxis are always magically waiting for your convenience, as well). -The ambience of the entire hotel is indefinately the most magical. The lobby is magnificant and always spotless, with it's memorable shops (including a woman's boutique, barber shop, huge Disney store, smaller Disney shop and i believe a salon for women). The hotel is huge and the grounds are beautifully, and wonderfully well kept. There is, along with the main building, a number of other buildings on the grounds. My family personally enjoys Boca Chica with views of the beautiful yet simple garden pool, and it's great poolside bar, in the midst of the property. There is a great sand-beach on the lagoon (overlooking the Polynesian) next to the beach pool, and it's poolside bar. The beach pool is accompanied with an awesome slide for kids also. -Dining amenities are unbelievable! We spend most outside-of-the-park-meals during our stay at the Gasparilla. A huge, 24-hour fast-food place that you have to see to believe. It maintains the beauty and cleanliness of the resort while being fast and serving up anything--and i really mean everything. Gasparilla is great for all meals and snacks. You can even sit outside on the deck overlooking the theme-parks for a great fireworks view! We love Narcooses on the lagoon, as well. We have enjoyed Citrico's in the past, along with most of their endless dining possibilities! -Service is phenomenal. Everywhere you go the employees are so family-friendly and welcoming!

Unlike our other stays, when we worked with one person, we knew her days off and her hours of work. This time we ended up speaking with 5 diffrent people, and it would take days to get a call returned. Then my wife remembered how well we were taken care of on our last two visits by the desk concierges. We tried to call the Royal Palm Club direct, and after much debate from the hotel operator, who told us they did not take \"outside calls\", we were finely put through. What a relief to have Dan answer the phone, and to find out that Mejay was still there too. It just made our day! If you need anything, these are the one's to depend on. Other cast members assured us requests would be taken care of, to find out the next day, nothing had been done. Mejay and Dan always took up the slack. In general, the hotel is not as friendly as it was before. Lots of newbies, who have no idea what the Disney service method is. If you've been there before, you will notice the changes as soon as you arrive at the Security Gate. The day we arrived, the guard looked like a bum ! Hat not straight, collar not tight and his belt was rolling down the outside of the pants, and yes, we did see underwear. A young lady in the booth was expecting us, and after confirming our name, instructed us to the front of the hotel where we would be met by our concierge. Upon arrival, our valet did not have that sharp welcome and full family attention we remembered from the past trips. Once we met our concierge, we were told that she would be doing our in room check-in for us, but then were told the room was not ready and we sat in the lobby going over personal information, and she had to write down our credit card number. My wife asked if Mejay or Dan could complete the check-in since we were feeling a little uneasy about all this, and were told that they did not do check-ins anymore. We later found that to be wrong. The hotel operator did call us to let us know our room was ready before 3pm.

Very clean and the housekeeping staff always left little fun \"surprises\" in the room. We had a marina view which was ok - but most rooms in that building have either marina or pool view (no MK view). However, from my balcony, you could actually see the fireworks (we were at the very end so we had a decent angle). It was better to just take the very short walk to the marina for the fireworks. The food offerings and having the concierge in the building were both excellent. Nice to grab a snack, coffee, drink without getting nickle and dimed to death. Although we did the Disney dining plan, it still made sense to be in the concierge level and would absolutely do it again. The location of the property, is of course, ideal. One quick stop on the monorail to get to MK and first stop back by boat. Can not beat that when traveling with little kids. We took advantage of the \"disney resort hours\" both early and late and were able to come back to the hotel inbetween. The two pools were nice and the one pool with the slide was perfect for kids. I will note here how efficient the lifegaurds at this pool were. Unlike many life gaurds who passively sit on a chair working on their tans, these lifegaurds were very pro-active and watchfull and gave my wife and I a very high level of comfort while our kids were in the pool. Of course, the grounds were immaculate - very much an extension of the Disney experience. My wife did mention to me that the gym had machines that were not working and that overall the gym was disappointing.

We had issues with housekeeping as our room was not cleaned while we were at the parks. For example, we returned from MGM one day at 3:30 and our room had not yet been cleaned. Trying to get someone on the phone is ridiculous. Always a wait for front desk or concierge. Speaking of concierge, one guy was completely useless. He had no info re:dining. We were trying to decide between 2 popular restaurants and he had no idea how they were. The pools were unbelievably crowded at this time of year and frankly there were people there who were not hotel guests. You do not have to show your card to get towels or chairs and anyone can enter the resort from the monorail or parking lot for that matter, who is not a hotel guest and use the pool! The waterslide was under repair during our entire stay - the kids were really bummed. They also didn't clean up at the pool at all. We managed to get one cot (for 4 of us) for a couple of hours and the table next to us had dirtly dishes/cups/towels etc. on it for the entire time and the people had left. There is no shade at the pool. The umbrellas are for the dining tables and cannot be moved. This was surprising from a so-called deluxe property. We ate the the Grand Floridian cafe which was fine. Gasparilla's has lots of choice for snacks and sandwiches. We actually used up the rest of our snack credits from the dining plan on the last day and got bagels and cream cheese for our flight home. Beware of Disney's Magical Express. When I called to make our reservation they wanted us at the airport 4 hours ahead of time! (for canada) After many inquiries we discovered the busride is one hour from the airport. This includes the time it takes for the driver to load and unload all of the luggage. They won't let you off the bus till everything is unloaded. Plan accordingly. I eventually called back and told them my flight was later than it actually was and arrived 90 minutes prior to flight time as recommended by the airline. It is nice to be a resort guest as anything you buy in the parks will be sent to your hotel free of charge. That way it is easier to spend your money. In case you didn't know, all the rides in Disney (most of them) end in a store of some sort. You don't need to carry money because your room key is encoded with your info and all purchases show up on your hotel bill. It is very convenient. We would stay here again BUT only because of the location. I know it is overpriced but only because the convenience outweighs the negatives.", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Stephlovestravel", "ReviewID": "UR7443373", "Content": "Having stayed @ most of the Disney Deluxe Resorts, I was a little apprehensive about spending the extra $$ to stay here. turns out, totally worth it!

Though the hotel was crowded, we had a great time. This hotel is far and away the most luxurous hotel that I have ever satyed in. When I first walked into the lobby, I was blown away. Vases of flowers were placed on nearly evey table and gorgous chanderliers hung from the celings. The victoiran decor is truly charming. The hotel's grounds are beautiful and well maintained. There are two pools at the resort, the \"quiet pool\" with a pooolside bar and a pool with a waterfall and slide that is geared towards kids. While lounging by either pool, you truly feel that you are in paridise. The hotel also has a beautiful white sand beach that rivals many of the beaches throughout the carribean. Though you are not permitted to swim in the lagoon that the beach is nestled on, speedboats are avialable for use. I would highly reccomend renting one for an hour or two, as they are really fun to ride in. Though the hotel is home to many excellent restaurants, my favorite would definitley have to be Narcooses. The food is delicious, and the atmoshphere and staff are wonderful. If you are dining around the time that the firework show is going on, be sure to request a table by the window. Those tables have a direct view of Cinderella's castle . If you can't manage to get a table by the window, there is an excellent view of the show from the restaurants balcony. The grand flo's only counter service option is Gasparilla Grill. Though there are many negative comments about it on the site, we found it to be a great value. The food is generally good, and you can really make use of your counter serive credit. (if you are on the meal plan) The brownies and chocolate chip cookies are especially delicous. The grand floridian cafe was dissppointing, as the food isn't of high quality. The hotel's rooms are of average size, and are decorated nicely. I wasn't blown away by the rooms, but they were certainly a notch above your average hotel room. We were given a beutiful view of the marina, but if you cna swing a magic kingdom view, that is definitley the best choice. The one and only compalint I really have about this hotel is the front desk staff. They are slightly hostile and are not approchable. However, we did encounter many helpful Floridian cast members throughout our stay, so don't think that all of the workers are rude. I think that the hotels best quality is itts location. You are literally two minutes away from the magic kingdom, and the monrail service is great. However, when you are coming back from the magic kingdom, take the ferry instead of the monorail. It is quicker, as the Grand is the last stop on the monorail when returning form magic kingdom. Though the other two monorail resorts were also nice, they weren't in the same league as the Grand Floiridian. If you are unsure if you want to spend the extra money to stay at the grand, I would definitley recocmend doing so.

I came with my partner but without my children on this one occasion. We naively thought that there would be less young children running and noise than a value resort but were wrong. We were also annoyed at the long check in queue. We just didnt expect that in a 5 star hotel. In our opinion they should have been better prepared for it being busy and arranged more staff, especially with what they charge. We also assumed that the main building with the piano and everything else was the only building and we visualised staying in there. We were shocked at first to be sent outside to another building. However, we were glad of it in the end. It was wonderful with the magic kingdom view and the excellent view of wishes. Also, it was nice and quiet. I do think we should have been offered assistance to take our cases to the room, but we later found out this help was only offered to guests staying in the main building. When I booked the hotel I really thought that EVERYBODY would be treated like 5 star guests. I also have to add here that the customer service at the VALUE hotel, allstars, was much better. I got the impression that first class service was for those guests who payed extra to stay in the main building. I think the price of this hotel would be more justified if we were given the same first class treatment you would get in an ordinary 5 star hotel. The restaurants were first class and even the gasparilla counter service did nice food. The annoying thing would be that its difficult to get a reservatioin as they allow people to use the restaurants who do not stay on disney, which I think is wrong.Its also difficult to get a table in the parks without a reservation. Yet, Its impossible to decide 3 months in advance exactly where you want to eat. My way of getting round that problem was to overbook a few extra tables in advance at the hotel and parks then nearer the time cancel what you dont want. The room was very nice. I just think there could be room for improvement with the bath tub. It was small, old and shabby. I was told though, that all the rooms are going to be refurbished and will definetely return AFTER that is done. I noticed a guest complained about the boat horn, but I personally enjoyed that sound.It was nice being so close to the water and the magic kingdom boat. The hotel pools, shops, beach and evening entertainment was fantastic.The crowds were bearable, just. Never in a million years would I come here in peak season. I wont use the dining plan again because I often over indulged just so I would use all my credits. But I do recommend them. To get the best value, use counter service credits for breakfast and table service for meals.There are one or 2 restaurants that tske 2 table credits, but they are worth it if you are going to eat away from disney any days. Also, dont use the snack credits to buy drinks. you can buy sweets, fruit bowls or most things up to a value of 3.99 dollars.

Every single time we stay there, we are more than pleased- the service is impeccable, the rooms are very quaint as well as comfortable, and the Lagoon View is a MUST. One of my fondest memories of this hotel is getting up in the morning to the faint sound of the ferry horn, and walking onto the veranda in pjs and slippers and hand-feeding birds that flew to our balcony. This is no exaggeration- if you leave crackers on the ledge, by the second morning the birds know where the food is, and they are not afraid to take this food right from your hand. The main lobby is gorgeous- from the amazing chandeliers to the wonderful pianist and the small jazz orchestra located on the 2nd floor balcony. The shops are high-end, featuring Tommy Bahama apparel and Bally's leather goods, among others. In addition, there are also gift shops, one which includes mostly toys for children such as autograph books, stuffed Disney animals, and more. The restaurants at the GF are wonderful- Narcoosse's is relaxing and perfect if you would like to see the water pageant or fireworks show from your seat or from the outer veranda. My favorite restaurant in Disney is Victoria & Albert's, located in the GF main buiding. Although it is pricey, the food is outstanding, and the service is impeccable. Each female consumer leaves the restaurant with a complimentary red rose. While staying at the GF, I highly recommend renting the speed boats. They are so much fun for the entire family. I also recommend visiting the pool at night. My sister and I have often swum close to midnight and it is extremely quiet and peaceful, as there are no children there at this time at night. The balcony from a Lagoon View room is also a great feature for the night time. My sister and I made screwdrivers and sipped them on the balcony at night, wearing shorts and still feeling quite comfortable. I am from Long Island, and my family and I enjoy five-star hotels.

We just returned from a week stay at the Grand Floridian (12/29-1/5) It is a beautiful hotel with a fantastic location. We were in the Conch Key building, and while we technically had a \"garden view\" room, it was anything, but. We had a fantastic view of the midnight fireworks on both the 30th and 31st of December. These fireworks were shot off from the island in the middle of Seven Seas Lagoon, and it felt like we could reach out an touch them. We also could watch the nightly water parade from our room, if we wished. The rooms were very comfortable--especially the beds. The hotel has several very good dining options, shopping, nightly entertainment (usually a piano player or a swing band) two lovely pools, and a nice beach. It is beautiful. Yes, it is very expensive! But, you are really paying for the location. You can be in the Magic Kingdom in about 10 minutes after you leave your room by using the monorail or the water ferry. The water ferry is especially convenient on returning from the Magic Kingdom as only people who are staying at the Grand Floridian or the Polynesian use it, and its first stop is always the GF. The water taxis come every 8 minutes. This convenience also means that it is easy to get back to your room for a midday rest and return to the parks easily at night when they are less crowded. While the Polynesian and the Contemporary are also on the lagoon and the monorail, the GF is definitely more upscale with little touches like nightly turn down service and a fully stocked mini-bar. So, is it worth it? It just depends on what you're looking for--we certainly loved the \"full experience.\" Would we stay here again over the Polynesian? I don't know, probably not for the additional $150 more per night. But, it was fun. I would not recommend this hotel for a vacation that does not involve the Disney parks--if you want to stay at a beautiful hotel for a relaxing vacation, you can certainly stay somewhere else just as beautiful, probably with a better view (ocean) and better service. But, if you are going to Disney and want all the conveniences that will make your experience as comfy as possible, this is a great place.

My son had runny nose (allergic rhinitis) and my wife coughed a lot at night while still recovering from her flu contracted before our trip. The Magic Kingdom views from our room at Polynesian were great but we decided to switch to Grand Floridian to avoid the allergy problem and the service is far below we expected for what we paid for (~US$450 per night). We also extended our stay for two more nights (22nd & 23rd) at the GF so that we would visit the Disney Park more thoroughly A lot of the negative comments about the Grand Floridian at Trip Advisor are very accurate. The biggest regret I had was that we had purchased the Premium Dining Plan. We spend plenty of our time worrying if we could utilise all the 45 coupons (1 cpn * 3 persons * 3 meals / day * 5 nights) for the 5 nights and justify the expensive price we paid (approx. US$2200 for 6 days). The good thing with Premium plans is the freebies (1) free use of activities centre and (2) free use of the boats/fishing tour, horseride, pony ride. Cost-wise, however, i'm not sured you end up saving real money in a big way and you lose flexibility. We believe we could have saved all the trouble/worries and probably money if we had forgot about the dinner plan and pay everything in cash. The meals in Disney are indeed rather expensive. Be prepared for that. Breakfast will usually cost btw US$60-90+ per 2 adults + 1 child at the restaurants with character. Dinner at $$$ restaurant will cost upwards of US$120+ and lunch somewhere in between these two. But we don't have that much appetite and so we end up not eating lunch some of the time and thus made it harder for us to finish all the coupons. Comments on Grand Floridian Rooms are good. beds are comfortable and feel like 5 stars. Service is rather poor. If you are lucky, you may bump into a staff who is extremely helpful (i came across a few). But most of them appear indifferent to customer complaints. Since we changed hotel 2 times and had to use new hotel cards every time, we had trouble asking the concierge/front desk to transfer all our tickets / premium dining plans onto the new cards. THey said they did it but it never seemed to work. So, there was once i went to a Disney Park only to find we could not get in with our new hotel cards and had to go to the ticket information, spend 15 mins explaining everything before we could enter. Same case with dining plans. Often, the servers forgot to deduct our coupons and just charged the bill to our room. It happened often enough to make us feel frustrated. In total, i guess i probably wasted between 90 to 120 mins unncessarily at the concierge. I think generally the service only lives up to 3.5 star standard. There may be understaffing problem b'cos a bell man complained to me 'I have five cars to park. if you are checking in, ask the people inside to help you get the bags' in fact, we have been instructed by the bell captain inside to go out and ask the bell man outside. In generally, don't expect to be pampered at the GF. You won't get that experience. But it's a very well-decorated (by disney standard) and very conveniently located hotel (5 mins by ferry from Magic Kingdom) and right on top of monorail. The food in the restaurants (even the cafe) is way better than elsewhere and of course, it feels more upscale. These are the main selling points, not personalised service. My favourite restaurant at Disney: Bistro De Paris. Narcoosee is not worth the price. Citricos is mediocre. GF Cafe and Park Fare are both good.", "Date": "December 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBring your cash, credit cards, lines of credit, and second mortgage your home!\u201d", "Author": "Fourseasondreamer", "ReviewID": "UR6479890", "Content": "We are Florida residents and stayed at the Grand Floridian (GF) on December 14th (our anniversary) and 15th, 2006. Our rate was $340.00 a night plus tax. We have stayed at several of the Disney properties from the \"value\" at $64.00 a night to \"moderate \"room at around $200.00. All during different times of the year. THE BASICS: The room was decorated very nicely but certainly not \"plushly\". It had 2 queen beds, a day bed, a porch looking over the marina, a very nice bathroom, and a 22\" t.v.. In keeping with the Disney standard it was spotless and had the touches one would expect with an expensive hotel, i.e. better soap and shampoo, turn down service with chocolates, bigger towels, etc. It also had a locked stocked refridgerator. THE GOOD: The GF has several restaurants, boutiques, a lovely lobby, a games room which is open 24 hrs, bigger rooms, mostly short walks betwen the rooms and transportation, room service, and bell service. THE NOT SO GOOD: The GF has boat service running from it to the Magic KIngdom. As a result the boats horn blows twice, loudly, every 10 minutes or so starting at 7:00 a.m. You can also hear very clearly the train from the Magic Kingdom which runs every 3 minutes or so. Pretty frustrating if you are exhausted. To eat in one of the restaurants you will need to make reservations 3 mos in advance. We prefer not to plan every single meal whilst on vacation! The 24 hour \"grill\" is available but has limited choices. The parking lot is literally 1/2 a mile away and as a result most people valet. Valet service is $7.00 a day and usually has a long line. The valet people do their very best but during busy times it is very hectic and time consuming. THE INSULTING: So you've already dropped AT LEAST $340.00 a night for the room. A one day ticket without park hopper is $65.00, a person. To eat in any of the average walk up service restaurants you've spent on average $40.00 a meal (for 3). Parking was $7.00. etc. etc. You think, o.k., I will enjoy a basic Recce's peanut butter cup from the fridge...$4.00! A basic bag of Lays chips...$3.00. To drink yourself silly after spending your kids inheritance...travel size of Jack...$5.00. TIPS: If you are there during a special occassion mention it when you are checking in.. They will give you a button and you get little perks throughout the parks. Le Cellier is the steak restaurant in Epcot for Canada. It books up 6 mos in advance.. They open for dinner at 4:00 but if you get there at 3:30 they will take walk-ins. It is ABSOULUTELY worth the money. You will not be sorry you spent the cash. Yummy! When you are leaving the Magic Kingdom take the boat rather than wait for the monorail.. The boat only goes the GF (first) and then the Polynesian (second). The monorail hits the GF last after going to the Contemporary and Polynesian, plus hundreds more are going somewhere other than the GF!! IN CONCLUSION: For the amount of time that you spend in the room pick the value or the moderate resorts. They are spotless, have food, excellent pools, comfey beds, better parking and are much less expensive. Even if you are on your honeymoon you will be pleased with the moderate over the deluxe because in the world of \"Deluxe\" hotels the GF is really just a moderate hotel. It just happens to be the best that Disney has to offer.

Checking in was smooth and easy and we appreciated the fact that no matter what questions you ask - they will have an answer. Our room was very clean and comfortable - great for a honeymooning couple. We apparently had an a-joining room and we could hear the family on the otherside quit clearly, so not the best in sound proofing. The fireworks at night do make it feel like a war zone, but for only 20 minutes and its pretty quiet at night. The turn down service was very nice. The maintanece staff was very helpful and quick to respond. While I think it's pointless to have the spa so far away from the hotel - it was quite a walk from our marina room - the spa was very clean and relaxing. The pools are very nice and I really enjoyed the private white sand beach. Complaint: the staff used the sidewalks to transport luggage, food service and so on with their golf carts, this was not only annoying but could be a bit of a hassle. It is difficult to to walk from one buidling to another without the fear of getting run over by a golf cart, stroller, or an elderly person's scooter. The restuarants were nice and the food was great - 1900 Park Fare was our only complaint, we think it made us sick. Tip: If you are not from the area, do not drink the Florida water - while we had a great honeymoon - it isn't fun staying int he hotel because you are sick! Tip: Do your research before going to Disney. The Unoffical Guide to Disney was the best book I ever bought! it can be found at most Barnes &Noble stores - you need it to understand the dinig plan systems - they are cryptic and even the staff has a hard time understand your dindig option - on the plus side, any dinig plan is MORE convienient than taking cash everwhere.

First the not so good bits: Whilst we could see the lagoon from our window, there were trees growing outside the room which obscured the view (might be a good idea to check if the view is obscured when you book, we stayed in a room on the first floor); Waited 25 minutes for a bus to Animal Kingdom only to find it full and was told it would be another 25 minutes so we ended up driving there (OK it was Thanksgiving week but you think that they would put more buses on). The good bits were we got free parking in the theme parks with our room key; The staff were very helpful although the lady who checked us in overdid it a bit with the \"Disney Magic thing\"; the bed was really comfortable; The maid service was exceptional and we even got a half bottle of champagne left in our room to celebrate or wedding anniversary; Watching the fireworks from the resort was really good especially when we did not have the fight the crowds afterwards. Top tips: Don't worry about staying in the main building, I think that it could get noisy and concierge service prices are not worth it. Remember to make reservations for all the restaurants well in advance - Victoria and Albert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take bookings 6 months ahead of arrival.

We paid $1,600 for three nights, including park tickets, so this is by no means a cheap hotel stay. Although we have traveled extensively and frequently stay at 4 or 5 star hotels, this is the first time in many years of travel that we have been made to feel like second-tier customers deserving inferior service. Every single day of our stay, it was made obvious to us that good service was reserved for \"concierge-level guests\", those paying close to $500/night per room. A few examples: Day two of our stay we tried to make reservations for BREAKFAST. Nothing fancy here, we just prefer buffets for breakfast, and this was the only place in the hotel offering a buffet. We were told that the only tables available were for \"concierge level guests\" and that if we wanted a buffet breakfast we would have to catch a bus to the animal kingdom lodge. NOT! We were not pleased about this-- at $400/night we expect to be able to eat breakfast at our hotel. Another example: the TV in our room came equipped with a video player (but no pay-per-view). After a long day in the park, we felt that some quiet time in our room watching a Disney video would be a nice change of pace for our two year old daughter. We went to the concierge desk and asked if videos were available for rent-- the answer was not a simple yes or no, it was \"what is your room number?\". We were then told that videos were availble only to concierge level guests!!!!! Wake up, Disney! Concierge level service at other luxury hotels means bigger rooms, nicer views, a lounge with food NOT bad service to other hotel guests. My advice: the convenience of staying at a Disney resort is great, but unless you want to be treated like a second class citizen, seek out a resort with only one level of service.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201c4-Star Hotel, 5-Star Service\u201d", "Author": "BeccaLinda", "ReviewID": "UR6003365", "Content": "My husband and I recently spent a week at WDW in the Grand Floridian for our honeymoon (10/8-10/15). At first we hit a couple of bumps in the road. (1) We couldn't find where to drop our bags for concierge and ended up parking across the street only to haul our bags in with us. (2) Once we got in we were told it would be a half-hour wait for our room to be ready (ok, fine), but they also told us they'd let us know when it was ready (we sat near the desk in the grand lobby). So we waited ~45 minutes only to ask and find out our room had been ready for 20 minutes. At that point we asked if it would be possible for concierge to take our bags (and us) up to our room, since the place is rather spread out and tough to navigate on your first day, and they told us it would be another 20 minutes. We ditched that idea (after making us wait 25 minutes longer than we had to, I though it was the least they could do, but oh well) and dragged our bags up to our room. At least when we got there, there was a big bottle of Evian and a box of truffles waiting for us, which we later learned were part of our stay (in other words, no $10 bottles of water unless you pull it out of the mini-fridge). The room was pretty nice-- not as nice as some places I've stayed, but pretty close. The furnishings were really different than your average hotel, giving it a homey feel. After our check-in problems, service was top of the line from then on in. I forgot a razor, which was not available in the shop downstairs, and they brought up two with a can of shaving cream free of charge. The maid and turn-down service was impeccable, and we even got champagne and a rose from Mickey and Minnie (with an autographed photo). We thought that was sweet. The convenience of the Grand Floridian can't be beat-- it can only be matched by the Contemporary and the Polynesian. Being on the monorail line is the way to go if you're visiting WDW if you want to get in and out of the parks quickly (especially if you have young children with you). As far as WDW in general, here are our suggestions: *Go with a meal plan. We got the premium one, but even that can be a bit too much food. At least go with the standard one-- if you look at your check at the end of each meal, you'll probably find it was worth it, money-wise, plus you don't have to worry about carrying credit cards/cash at all, then, unless you want to buy souvenirs. *Pick where you want to eat each night (you may want this to coincide with the nights each park stays open late) and make reservations when you arrive at WDW-- before, if possible. We missed at least two restaurants we wanted to try because we couldn't get a reservation. *Eat off-peak if you can. We ate at the Grand Floridian Cafe for breakfast every day, usually after 10AM. The one day we went earlier we had to wait for a table, and people around us were snapping at the hostess because they weren't getting seated in front of people with reservations. Not a pleasant scene, but the staff handled it beautifully. *If you stay at the Grand Floridian, spring for a room with a lagoon view, as opposed to a garden view. At first I didn't think it was that big a deal, but within a day I realized it was worth being able to see Cinderella's castle and watch the Magic Kingdom's fireworks shows from our balcony. Generally the Grand Floridian was a very, very pleasant stay, with outstanding service (at least after our initial impressions).

I am a 46 year father of two little girls and I have put off going to Disney for years. Finally my wife said, \"either it's Disney or divorce\" rightly thinking of our children. So, I went as one goes into a Root Canal. Perhaps this explains my enthusiasm for the Grand Floridian and Disney as a whole--not a hole! The Grand Floridian is a spectacular hotel that appears like a grand Floridian mansion. Everyone in the facility appears happy and is friendly. You arrive to a spectacular lobby of top level pianists or a large band. Sometimes they play the disney songs and other times they play great jazz. We had a concierge suite which I highly recommend as they were always available and incredibly helpful. Our room was large and beautiful with lovely bathrooms. I have two girls ages 5 and 9 and they were in heaven with all the princess breakfasts and lunches. I was amazed at the high level of organization, efficiency and friendliness of both the hotel and the resort. In order to avoid the crowds, I recommend the following: Be at the opening of the resort at 9am and not one minute later. You'll have virtually no lines for 1.5 hours. Then at 11am when the main body of people arrive, use the fast passes to hit one or two more spectacular rides. Then have a lunch (must be pre-arranged) with the disney characters and take the afternoon off for swimming, tennis, golf or sleeping. With this system, we found the theme parks totally enjoyable and never faced absurd crowds. For golfers, Disney is fantastic. I played the Palm and another one that starts with a \"C\" and they were amazing. Again the Disney organization and the hotel, made this easy. I highly recommend a dinner at Todd English's The Blue Zoo. Again a complete surprise to find one of the nation's top sea food restaurants in Disney. We also went to the Grand Floridian's celebrated Victoria and Albert restaurant which was fantastic but not as exceptional as the Blue Zoo (a concierge recommendation). I had a disagreement about a taxi charge and within a minute a manager called and said, \"no problem. Sorry for the inconvenience and the charge is already eliminated\". For all you dads out there, Disney doesn't suck. You'll have a great time. Enjoy the rides, investigate and hit some of the wonderful restaurants and play some golf and tennis.

First of all, the queues at disney are big BUT if you do your homework and dont go in peak season like some people! and use your disney fast passes, then its not a problem at all. the resort itself is upper market and i agree it is more of an adult hotel but only because it gives disney magic with the added benefit of an upper market stay. I have no hesitation of recommending this hotel, staff are friendly and go out of their way to be nice, its like everything if you are ruide to them then they will not go out of their way to help you back. Its worth having a lagoon view room though as the pool views and esp the marina view is always noisy. The hotel room was spotless and i felt it was a very magical stay, so magical that i intend to stay there again next year. Please dont believe the bad reviews, yes its expensive but hey! youre in disney this is what you should expect, well worth it though in my opinion! Monorail is best option, buses come frequently too for this hotel. Other resorts have crowded buses and you wait for up to an hour for a bus (if youre lucky enough to fit on one with all the other people being picked up first). the extra money is so worth it once you realise how convenient everything is at this hotel.

This one also has a waterfall and huge waterslide. My kids prefered the one with the waterslide. One night we did a character dinner. The characters included Cinderella, Prince Charming, The Fairy God Mother, and her mice friends. My kids loved this! They had a kiddie buffet and one for the adults. My husband and I loved the food!

The rooms were a good size, but our balcony was filthy and the bathrooms are in need of replacement. Our mini bar was really dusty, and the bathroom really smelt! Another problem was that we were put next to the lifts which gives you a defening night of endless screaming children and the movement of the lift up and down. Our sink in our room was also blocked. Another major problem we had was that the cards you get from the hotel to get into the park were constantly not working i think we changed them about 8 times in a 5 night stay! The staff printed the wrong names on the cards all the time which caused alot of confusion. And a word of warning do not let them deliver your luggage to your room unless you dont mind being stuck in the same clothes you have been on the plane on for about 4 hours! Restaurants are ok, but breakfast is hectic and the whole hotel needs a really good refurbishment. Disney is a horrendous holiday destination in my opinion, i mean we knew it would be busy but it was horrendous. even at 2 am for the extra hours we were queing for 45 mins to get on a ride.

But there's one really important things to understand about this hotel that - as far as I see - hasn't been mentioned yet... The 5* rating refers to the hotel's rating ** in comparison to the other Walt Disney World Hotels **. So the rooms per se aren't going to blow you away and the staff, while helpful and personable, haven't quite grasped the difference between world-class style and great-for-kids Disney-fied atmosphere. They genuninely wish a \"magical day\" and deal with problems quickly, but members of les cl\u00c3\u00a9s d'or they're not. But don't let it worry you! There are some really good (sometimes excellent) things about this hotel. Firstly, its location at one mono-rail stop away from the Magic Kingdom couldn't be better. You can spend time in the park, come back for Afternoon tea or a Concierge-room snack, and then return later on for Wishes (or whatever) refreshed and ready for more action. There's an excellent ratio of staff to customer, the decor, beaches and pools are all in fine condition - the pool was heated even though the outside temperature was approaching 100! - and the kids are as well behaved as you're going to get in Disney World - even if some little Princes and Princesses bordered on the spoilt and / or precocious. This counts for a lot if you're not bringing children to the hotel. It is definitely a pleasure spending time in the hotel and most certainly isn't just a \"place to stay\". Overall, I would recommend this hotel and - from what I can see - it's almost all good so don't fret too much about the type of room or its view. The restaurants, the bars, the lobby and reception are all open to everyone regardless of what type of room you're in. So for that reason, do think carefully as to whether it's really worth paying for the Concierge room. Yes, there's food on demand but what price convenience? I wasn't necessarily convinced I'd got value for money. In the It is definitely a pleasure spending time in the hotel and most certainly isn't just a \"place to stay\".

We traveled with my 4 year old which is never an easy task, but immediately upon checking in they gave her some disney stickers and some crayons to keep her busy. Our room was in Sugar Loaf, which is a fantastic location next to the 24 hour pool, close to the boat launch AND the monorail. The room was very clean, charming and comfortable.

Oddly, the other reservation we made in January for the same day for dinner at Artist Point at Wilderness Lodge was correct. We frequently encounted other families at different venues arguing about incorrect reservations as well.

Also, Magic Kingdom is only a monrail or ferry boat away. Also, sine you are so close to magic kingdom, it is unimaginable to get a room without some sort of view of the park.

We arrived late on a Thursday night, and we had reserved a garden view room. Upon arrival, they had upgraded us to a lagoon view room! (I had faxed them a few days earlier to tell them it was my husband's 30th birthday, I also called to let them know) So when we walked into the room, there was a birthday cake on the table! It said Happy 30th birthday amd it was SOOOO GOOOD! Our view was outstanding, the lagoon, the castle, space mountain, and the monorail! The room was beautiful. It isn;t huge, but it did fit a king size bed, a couch and table comfortably. We also had the room with the arched cielings which meant we had the smaller balcony, but it was big anough for the two of us to sit out there, eat our cake and enjoy the view! The staff was wonderful there, so nice and friendly. They were always helpful, even when my husband and I needed anew key to our room because we left it in the room when we went to go get a drink at midnight! The restaurants there are very good. We ate at the 24 hour Gasparilla Grill a couple of times, and they had pretty good food. We really liked the pizza at lunch and the chicken fingers. Breakfast was normally a quick muffin or chocolate croissant (yum!). We also ate at 1900 Park Fare for a character buffet breakfast and that was outstanding! I think it was 20 dollars for all you can eat. The atmosphere was fabulous, the staff was great and the food was delicious. (Try the strawberry soup!!) We also dined at Citricos on Valentines's Day and it was wonderful. Pretty pricey, but very good. They brought us free dessert, lemon cheescake and for a person who doesn't like lemon, I ate every bite and wanted more.My meal was just ok, I had fish and spinach risotto. Can't recall the fish but it was very good, but the risotto was too watery, I like it thick and creamy. So that was my only complaint. We sat in front of the Kitchen so it was neat to watch the Chef's. Again the staff was great. It was too cold to use the pool or beach area (it was literally a record low of 32 degrees while we were there) so all I can say is those areas looked really nice!! The lobby was grand and beautiful. Everything there is clean and spectacular. It's like walking into an 18th century hotel, with all the grandeur. There is a band at night in the lobby that plays big band music and a little restaurant that serves high tea with scones and sandwiches! Everything is so cute! There is also a hair salon (came in handy when my shampoo bottle exploded) and the monorail is one stop from the Magic Kingdom. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. It is highly priced, but if you go during value season (we did) and try to get a AAA rate, you may not pay as much (we had a huge discount) and with a free upgrade, it actually really made the stay worth the money. 6 nights of heaven!

We went the week after Thanksgiving so we could take advantage of the slower time in the park plus the Holiday celebrations. We stayed in a Concierge level room in the Main Building. For our family of four, which includes our 3 and 5 year old, we found two queen beds in our room to be more than ample. We had plenty of room. The room was impeccably clean, and the maids were fabulous. The added touch of washcloth animals is one my children still talk about. They couldn't wait to get back to the room each day to see what the wonderful maids left. Tipping them daily was a pleasure for all the little extras they provided for my family. We chose to spend the money on a Concierge level room, and for us, it was a decision we have never regretted. We would do it again in a heartbeat. The daily food presentation made our lives much easier, especially first thing in the morning and the end of the night. And all the reservations the Concierge staff helped us with made everything so much easier. They assisted us with all our dining experiences, both character and non-character, so that when we arrived, our trip was completely planned for us. And once we were there, the modifications we wanted to make were handled with ease. The Concierge staff is superb. We requested a room with a Magic Kingdom view, which they were able to accommodate, so watching the fireworks at night from our balcony was perfect. And the bedtime stories on the TV was a great nightly event, as the kids were asleep before the stories ended. The turn-down service turns this channel on for you, and so the kids come in looking excited to hear a final story for the evening. Our absolute best meal of the entire vacation was breakfast at the Grand Floridian Cafe. And we ate quite a bit all over the parks and the restaurants, but this was the best! The pools were great, and we spent as much time as we could taking advantage of them as well. We will only return to Disney World and stay in a Concierge level room in the Main Building.

Otherwise, the crazy queen from Alice in Wonderland on the bedspread, a nice balcony (not in January though), and a very very pleasant comfortable bed (thus we slept well despite elevator situation).

We had the platinum package add on, entitling us to concierge and \"the best of the best\". We were met at the door from our concierge, given a tour and taken to our room. It was a nice room, huge bed, wonderful balcony. And the grounds and lobby are fantastic. However, this is Disney, and children are abundant. We had a screaming 3or4 year old next door, who sounded as she were in the room with us. We could also hear conversations (not loud, just normal) from our neighbors. And if we could hear them, they could hear us. We called concierge because my husband had forgotten his comb, and requested one, forty minutes later, we recieved it. Our bathtub, while huge, had a clogged drain, 2 days after I called, it was repaired. We thought they took a little long responding to our requests. Room service is wonderful! Always on time, and prepared how we requested,however, on our plan all of our meals were free, and after looking at my bill we were charged, not once but three times for room service. We were also charged for our \"complimentry\" spa service, valet parking, (we had no car, we flew), and minibar charges that we did not use. Mistakes do happen, but to rectify those mistakes took days, I was still dealing with getting refunds 14 days after I returned home. The spa is great though! The lobby served wonderful snacks throughout the day, as well as coffees, teas, and sodas. We really did not recieve any special treatment from the hotel for our honeymoon, but the parks and other resturants made up for this. Victoria and Alberts is phenomenal!

We booked the honeymoon room which is located on second floor of Main Building. I've heard many negatives reports but thought sour grapes. So off we went Dec 4th. Got at the resort at 9:30am & was taken up to 3rd floor to check in. The person was very nice & said he would have room ready as soon as previous guests checked out at 11am. So we went over to MK, had lunch, rode some rides. Then we called at 1:30pm and he said it was ready. We headed back over & no room. He said he would see when next room would be ready. He came back & said 15 minutes just relax & have something to drink. So far okay. After an hour no room. Another person asked if we needed anything, we said we were waiting for our room. He checked & said one was ready. The concierge manager took us to our room. He asked if there was a special event that brought us to the GF we said yes & told him. After relaxing we went to the Christmas Party & came back around 9pm to find a platter of chocolate covered strawberries which I ordered for Monday so I thought they made a mistake. That night the noise level was way too loud but we over looked it. I mentioned to the person I ordered the strawberries that they brought it to us a day early & to cancel that night's she said she would call. (We saw the manager who asked if we liked the strawberries he gave us on the house? I said yes but he should have put that in the note.) That night more strawberries. Ok, she did say she would take them off bill. Ha! That night noise was louder than before called down to front desk since it was after 10pm & said they would check into it. It got worse between midnight until 4:30am, sounded like they were doing work on the building. Also TV didn't work, hair dryer didn't work. While hubby was getting ready the next day, I walked down to talk to another concierge, told him about the noise & other problems, please note there was other people complaing about contruction noises during early morning. He said he would look into it & he said he would give me a credit of half that night room rate we paid $615 plus taxes. I said I wasn't looking for that but wanted something done about the noise & other problems. He said he wanted to give some of it back. Nice touch so I thought. Later that night, more noise so I went down & talked to yet another person who came back to room & he said he didn't know what the noise was but he had another room on same floor. Okay so we changed hoping for the best & all the problems would go away. After having some dinner we came back to room, hubby said no working TV even though we tried it before we left for dinner. When trying to use toilet it didn't flush. Plus hair dryer didn't work. So we called down & reported this. He had a man up to check out toilet, he said it needed to be replaced all together, try not to use toilet paper & flush twice but to make sure it didn't over throw. This is not funny. He did replace the TV & said he would replace hair dryer the next day along with a new toilet. Andy called & said he heard what was going on & asked if we could be out of our room by 9am the next day, said yes, he said he was sorry but this too can be fixed.Oh postive side no noise. Next day, we stopped by desk to remind them about putting in new toilet & hair dryer. The guy even called while we were still there. So we thought all was okay finally. Came back around 2pm & no toilet replaced or hair dryer. And toilet didn't even work. We walked back to the desk and said what was going on? The lady was shocked that they didn't do the work. I reminded her we wasted about a total of a day with working out these problems which shouldn't have happen in the so call cream of the top resort in WDW. She called the maintaince manager who came up to our room & told us he just got yelled at by his boss & now it was our turn to yell at him. I just looked at him & said I wasn't going to yell but wanted to know why after there was a work order to do these things. (A good thing we came back as we were going to stay at MK for late closing if we did that no toilet.) He said he would replaced it & he didn't know why it wasn't. He had the two guys that was suppose to do come up. He asked them why didn't they follow instructions on a work order. All they could say we thought they would save the resort some money. I looked at them & asked if they would like to pay me what I paid for a room that didn't have a working toilet for a day & half? They said no they wouldn't like that. The manager told me it would be replaced & he would stay to make sure. After 4pm it was ready & working. We had dinner & went back to MK though we were rather in a grumpy mood over how we were being treated. To make a story short, when we checked out on Saturday morning, we wasn't given a credit even though I had the paper work. I checked over the bill & saw that they charged us for two orders of strawberries. I said I wasn't paying for something the staff gave us. He said he would take both off & give us the credit that wasn't on checkout bill even though it was in the computer. He said he was sorry that knew we had a bad week there & hoped we would give them another chance. I didn't say anything but Andy was there & knew I wouldn't come back next year with our son & his wife. We lefted saying thank goodness that is over with & hubby said he was sorry that he didn't listen to me about how much it was costing after he complained about our trip to the USVI being too much like only $2500 beachfront at the Morningstar at Frenchmen's reef. We paid over $5400 for 6 nights at the GF. A sour taste was left in my mouth Sunday when I checked my Disney Visa online & saw a $300 room charge. I called back down & talked to a front desk manager who looked it up & saw what was wrong, when they gave us a credit they didn't punch in a code therefore a charge instead of credit so I was charged twice even tough my paper work said a credit due me. He said he work take care of it & call me back. He did but said the department that handles it was closed on Sunday, he would do it first thing Monday & call me back before he left at 3pm today. No call back & when I called, he left at 1:45pm. I asked the person to have him looked into the matter that he & I talked about Sunday & call me back on Tuesday. She said she would leave a note. I think I will have better luck with Disney Visa but they said to try to work it out before I put in a dispute. Now I know some of you all loved the place, I didn't I went with open eyes & wasn't expecting so many problems, yes they tried to fix them but a little too late.

This was our first time staying at this hotel. We have stayed at the Polynesian & the Wilderness Lodge before and have always wanted to stay at the GF. So, we saved up for a year and splurged on our concierge room. First, let me tell you about our Disney's Magical Express (courtesy airport pick-up, including your luggage)experience. While it was great to get on the bus directly to our hotel and not worry about our baggage, our bus driver was \"hinting\" that gratuities were not included in the bus ride. I think that was a bit tacky. We were personally greeted before entering the hotel lobby and were whisked away to the Sugar Loaf building, where we were imeediately checked in. Our room was ready before 12 noon which was nice. This hotel is gorgeous! Absolutely stunning! Don't know why people say it is run down and in need of repairs - not so! We are huge Disney fans and are always amazed at the service we receive, both inside and outside the parks. However, I read that the maids at this hotel were extremely friendly, and I don't think I encountered one friendly smile or hello or good morning from any of them. Some days our room was not made up until it was turn-down service, and one time it was never made up. While most of the concierges were always friendly, there were at least two who never smiled at you or even said hello. Very unfriendly! Oh well! I noticed that when some of the food items were gone, they were never replaced. The thing that really bothered me is that although they tell you the Sugar Loaf building can only be accessed by your hotel key since it is concierge, this is not true. ANYONE can enter the Sugar Loaf building through their back entrance and help themselves to the offerings. The hotel was decorated for Christmas and absolutely stunning. The grounds were beautifully docorated with tons of poinsettias, huge pre-lit white grape-vine reindeer, flowers, Christmas trees, etc. The Sugar Loaf is very quiet and we never had a noise problem. Very convenient location to the Main Bldg., pools, etc. We decided to go to Disney the first week in Dec. because it is supposedly the least crowded time to go.....NOT SO!!!!! I don't think there is a \"slow period\". We went to the Magic Kingdom 4 times and it was always crowded. They have this new \"finger scan\" that you need to do when entering the parks. You slip your admission ticket into the machines, and then you have to line up your fingers so they can tell that is indeed your ticket, and you are not using someone elses. Complete waste of time since mine never matched my fingers even though I used the same one the whole trip. It backs up the lines and takes long to get thru the turnstiles. I hope Disney does away with this useless process. While I love DisneyWorld, and l loved staying at this gorgeous hotel, it was not worth $370 per night and Disney should be ashamed of the way they rob people with their outrageous prices. I am no frugal miser, but $5 for 2 bags of chips for the kids? $200 for my daughter to have tea with Sleeping Beauty? $5 for a pen?

Yes indeed! We got a complimentary upgrade to a concierge room (rm 4309 in the main bldg) It was fantastic! The great smell upon entering this room was memorable! Our complaints are so minor they are not even worth mentioning! We will definetely go back someday! One of the managers there (DJ) could not have been nicer! The atmosphere there is beyond words! When the jazz band wasn't playing, a piano player was. The view was awesome...fireworks from our balcony...how cool is that? And the soft mattresses...wow! No backaches from these beds! We watched the gingerbread house being built...it was fun to watch the progress! The fourth floor amenities were such a treat! The friendly staff...the elegant marble everywhere... the Victorian style uniforms ...the two awesome pool areas... the beach... I could go on & on. Overall, are things overpriced? Sure...but this should be expected not only at Disney, but any resort area. If you're a tightwad, you have the option of staying home... right? Overall, I have no regrets about spending the money.

I'm happy to say our expectations were either met or exceeded on every point! We stayed in the Sugar Loaf Building, which offers Concierge services, continental breakfast, light snacks and deserts, soft drinks, wine, beer and cordials, all included in the nightly rate. All the food was wonderful, there wasn't a single item I'd tried that I didn't like, and there was plenty of it as the food was frequently replenished. My one small quible was that they don't really have enough places to sit in the mornings when it is the most crowded. For the rest of the day it's fine, but I do wish they had a few more tables in the mornings. We found our room to be large, well appointed, clean and quiet. I cannot understand how people can think a room that is about 440 square feet (source: Unoffical Guide to Walt Disney World) is small! It's exactly half the size of my condo! I guess there are people who just can't be pleased. Anyway, we were there for 6 nights and never heard a peep from our neighbors. The only noise we ever heard were people talking in the hallway outside our door, and that only happened twice the hole trip, and only for a moment or two. We had no issues with our housekeeper, our room was clean and ready each day upon our return from the parks no matter when we came back, and the turndown service was a very nice touch. Our building and all public areas were very clean and well kept, all room service trays and dishes were picked up in a timely manner, if we saw a tray out as we were leaving, it would be gone upon our return. We saw no evidence of trash or litter anywhere on the extensive grounds, and the landscaping was wonderful. The Concierge staff were kind, polite, and very helpful with every request we had, from purchasing park tickets to helping us change our reservation, we decided to leave a day early due to hurricane Wilma as we could not risk getting stuck in FL. Every Cast Member (Disney employee) we came across greeted us with a smile and a \"Good Day\". Cast Members in all four theme parks were also just as friendly and helpful. We ate at two of the restaurants there, Narcoossee's and the Grand Floridian Cafe. We had dinner our first night at Narcoossee's and we both enjoyed our appetizer and meals, the service was just fine. Our breakfast at the Cafe was also excellent, and we were treated to a free glass of champagne since we were on our honeymoon. We also ordered breakfast for room service our last morning there, it was delivered at the time requested, the hot foods hot and the cold foods cold, exactly as we'd ordered even down to my special request on my egg order. If you're wondering why we ate out for breakfast twice when continental offerings were available for free in the lounge, it was because while the lounge food was excellent, every once and a while I crave a hot breakfast that includes eggs and hashbrowns. It is not a reflection on the offerings in the Concierge lounge, which were terrific! The transportation to the parks via monorail, boats, and buses were frequent, most of the time we waited less than five minutes, only once did we wait longer than 10, and that was because we had just missed the bus and had to wait the full interval until the next one came along. The parks themselves were wonderful as always, clean and well maintained with helpful and friendly Cast Members. Truly a magical place!

Resort Review Where? Grand Floridian - Royal Palm Club When? September 17th - 22nd 2005 We had been planning our stay at WDW for many months. It was to be our first WDW trip together and a very special one at that as we got engaged whilst there. We'd made a number of PS reservations beforehand, some of which were changed due to extra magic hours. Several emails / phone calls later we had confirmation of what we expected to do. For our holiday we had planned to stay at the Polynesian followed by the Beach Club. In July we discovered that we would no longer be staying at the Poly as the concierge rooms were due for refurbishment in Sept. Unfortunately for us, we found out this information not from Disney but from a third party website. WE actually contacted Disney to discuss it. We had not heard from them and it was just two months until we were due to arrive. After much discussion on the phone (internationally - at our expense), we were offered a room at the GF instead. Initially we thought this was fantastic. For most people (including us) staying at the GF is but a dream - it looks amazing from the pictures and sounds great from the reviews. Did we set our expectations too high? Read on... Having arrived after a long flight, I was a little upset not to be met / welcomed by anyone at the hotel. Walking through the main doors, the grandness of the lobby and furnishings soon took my mind off this. We walked over to the main check in desk/area (still not welcomed) and explained we were concierge guests. After 5 mins or so of tapping away, the lady at check in confirmed we were concierge and that some one would come over to meet us. Whilst waiting we took in the atmos - the main lobby is very grand and has a welcoming feel to it. A concierge staff member came over to show us around the hotel, explain the services and show us to our room. We were asked if we could take our own bags with us! No offer for someone to come get them for us. So we trawled our bags around the hotel with us and finally headed up to L3 via the lift. I think the Concierge lady was trying to make a good impression because she'd chat to every guest we passed en route. On L3 we sat down with another Concierge staff member who talked us through the various services and what we'd booked. To our surprise, half of our PS reservations were wrong - despite having email confirmation of the various bookings beforehand. We decided to come back and sort this out later as we were quite tired from the flight. At this point we also realised that the Disney computer system does not link bookings - they had no idea we would need transferring to the Beach Club (BC) in a few days.... Anyway, we were led to our room and shown around - including the super long * :-) * balcony. We were in room 4209. Pretty standard room with an unusually large balcony. No fridge though - which we then asked for. The balcony was dirty - obviously not maintained. I could tell the Concierge lady spotted this too, but still left it to me to ask her to get someone to clean it. Looking out over the balcony I could also see the paint coming off in various places. Shortly after she left the room, we started to unpack. Despite the minor issues, we were still overwhelmed to be in the GF and were keeping a happy face on things. The next day we asked about getting a fridge and checked that the balcony would be cleaned. We also changed the PS bookings to what we were expecting (using L3 concierge). We returned at the end of the day to find that no fridge had arrived and that the balcony had only been half cleaned (I took a digital photo of what remained for proof). The balcony was still dirty. If we had children, we would not have allowed them out there - serious. In the end we decided to clean it as best we could - so we could at least sit down to enjoy the MK fireworks (of which we had a superb view!). This was an absolute disgrace in our opinion - remember this is a $700 per night room rate. We were expecting the best of the best, literally. Throughout our stay we found the GF staff to be the least helpful / pleasant out of all the places we visited or stayed. About 50% of the staff were helpful & willing to speak with us. The food however was very good - especially between 5 and 7 pm when various buffet style dinner items would be put out. There was also a good selection of drinks, including beers. My only gripe was that we had to keep asking for sodas - there never seemed to be any out when we were in the lounge (BC Concierge had plenty out). The day prior to check out started interestingly - with a Magical Express letter on the door saying we were leaving the next day and going back to the airport. Be VERY aware of this if you are staying at more than one hotel. We were told by a Concierge staff member that the reservations/booking system simply cannot cope with transfers (a mainframe system), even though we were told it would be ok before arriving. Bit more mess for us to sort out, but we did sort it out. On the last night in the GF, we were awoken at 12:40 am to a VERY loud sound - something that we can both only describe as some kind of power tool. This lasted for a few minutes on and off. We'd had enough and called the front desk at 12:55 am. After being on hold, we were told that someone would investigate and get back to us. Just a minute or two later we heard the sound of tools being dropped / moved from above us (it may sound wierd, but we actually heard a screw being dropped and roll on the floor above, so it was very close by). The noise started again shortly after speaking to the front desk, but this time further away. It would seem that they had simply made the decision to continue with works in another location - ie further away. It was the only conclusion we could come to. There was no way these noises were natural - we had been doing DIY at home before arriving and knew these noises oh too well (drilling / sanding vibrations). We eventually got to sleep at 3:30 am, deciding it was best to leave it till the morning. We were awoken again at 6:30 am by the same noises - which appeared to be getting closer again. I suspect we were so tired, that we just slept through it for 3 hours. No one from the front desk 'got back to us'. After 3 hrs sleep we were not happy and contacted the Concierge staff by phone that morning. We were very much awake by this point. They assured us that maintenance work does not occur during the night. We know what we heard and after explaining all to the Concierge staff, they said they'd speak to the hotel manager and get back to us. About 30 mins later they called back and again said that no works were going on. However, they offered us a 50% reduction for that night. So despite them saying that nothing was going on, they still offered us a refund....Yes. This reinforced to us that something was happening. Another guest we bumped into in the corridoor also confirmed hearing those types of noises that night, but they were much further away on the floor and were able to sleep through it (how I wish I'd got their contact details!!!). We arranged a late check out on this final GF morning but could get no more sleep as the day had started and works were now going on outside / in other buildings. Plus we still needed to pack in time for check out. We were shattered and annoyed to say the least. By this point, we were so looking forward to getting to the Beach Club and couldn't wait to check in. I never thought I'd actually want to get away from the GF. Our bags went across seperately a few hours later via the bell service (very useful - take advantage if transferring). Our stay at the Beach Club 5th Floor was 10/10. The staff were friendly, helpful and greeted us every time we passed, even if they had a guest with them. Even the bell man took time out to chat for 5 mins when bringing our bags up to the room. Customer Service is something the GF really seemed to lack in our opinion. The lack of sleep really affected our stay at the BC as we had so much planned and just couldn't do it all. My fiancee (Becky) stopped half way round the World Showcase at Epcot and just started crying because she was so tired but wanted to carry on and see it all. We also had to miss our 9.30 pm carriage ride at FW on our last day as we were just too tired to make it. So much planning and expense went into our holiday and we just feel that it was taken away from us - it made it feel pointless. The lack of sleep also made the overnight flight back home an absolute nightmare. We were not prepared to 'lose a day' just to catch up on sleep again - our 3 days left were just too precious. We are not going to stay at the GF again and are looking forward to a stay at the Poly / BC next year. The experience has not put us off Disney - everything else was just amazing. Based on our stay, we'd give the GF 3 to 4 out of 10. HOWEVER - please judge for yourselves, this is simply our experience. I know there are many out there that have had a magical stay and many others that will. I would hope that we're part of the 'unlucky' minority. We will be advising Disney of our experience and concerns. Roll on Poly next year.

When I was a college student working over the summer at WDW in 1988, I was desperate for spending money and took an overtime shift at the Floridian, which at the time was being readied for its grand opening. One of my many jobs that night was to remove the 2x4s out of the gazebo in the back and sweep the place clean. Nearly ten years later, I hosted the cocktail hour for my wedding reception in that very same gazebo. Talk about coming full circle! The rest of our reception was in one of the GF's ballrooms and it went on until 12:30. I was pretty jazzed about spending the night in the honeymoon suite (value of $645 at the time, free for the exhausted but happy couple!) on the conciege floor. While my overall experience with the GF was marvelous - great party, wonderful food - I landed with a bit of a thud back on earth the next day. We asked to have our checkout time extended until 2 pm (I thought a reasonable request, since we'd gotten to the room so late after the wedding). We were told no. I was amazed and asked a manager to explain this to me (remember, we were on the conciege floor!) The story was that WDW was hosting a golf tournament and they needed to turn the room over someone involved with that. Now, you can guess that we spent a TON of money on the wedding (which I mentioned to the manager), and all we were asking for was another *three* hours in our (rather small, I might add) hotel room. Isn't check-in time 3:00? Still, the final answer was no. So the GF still has a special place in my heart, and I return there to visit every couple of years. Still love the lobby, the fireworks view from the hotel, and Narcoosee's (miss the yard beers, but they make the best Key Lime Martini you've ever had).

It was in the main building, concierge, and had a direct view of the lagoon and Cinderella's castle. We could see the fireworks every night right from our balcony. The room was similar in size to other Disney deluxe properties, but what really sets this hotel apart from other deluxe resorts are the beautifully manicured hotel grounds and the superior service. Both pools were great and we particularly enjoyed the beach cabanas. I spent an entire day at the spa with the Spa Escape package which included a secret garden bath, massage, facial, manicure and pedicure. Although I felt it was a little overpriced, it was a very relaxing day and the spa therapists were great. As for dining we tried the buffet character breakfast at 1900 Park Fare which was nice, especially if you have children, but it is a lot of food (much more than I would normally eat for breakfast).

The lobby is certainly \"grand\" in the strict sense of the word, and I'll give credit for the immaculate (if uninspiring) gardens, but otherwise this resort has little to recommend it and a host of reasons to avoid it. Superficially (in common with much of the rest of WDW I suppose) all seems fine at first glance, but on closer inspection all sorts of problems emerge. First, our room was horrible. For the price, it was really tiny, and was badly sound-proofed against noise coming up through the atrium and from the room next door. The decor was tired and the sheets were dirty, while the hinges on the bathroom door were rusted due to an extractor fan that worked but not very well. The bath and shower (all-in-one) were showing signs of age and the toiletries provided were cheap and nasty. Housekeeping was shoddy at best: our bedside lamps were dusty and had cobwebs on them, while our room wasn't vacuumed once during our stay. Nor was the balcony ever cleaned - the table and chairs were dirty and dusty. We sent about 2-3 days' worth of clothes for laundering, and it came back neither ironed nor folded, and one item was somehow stuck to a rather sticky hanger - for this we were supposed to pay almost $200 (when we complained the charge was waived). Overall, the room looked like it hadn't seen a makeover since the place was built, and probably hadn't seen a real clean for a similarly long period. As for the food, we found Citrico's to be okay but somewhat expensive for what you got. The character breakfast at 1900 Park Fare was entertaining for the kids, but a culinary experience it was not, and it was VERY busy (we only went once because every other day we tried to go the wait time was 30 minutes or more). The Grand Floridian Cafe was somewhat more sedate, but quality of service was very patchy, with some staff being somewhat less than friendly. Once again, the decor here was very tired, showing obvious signs of wear and tear in many places. As a general comment, we found eating properly at WDW to be a real challenge. Aside from portion sizes that could feed a small village, even the so-called \"healthy\" options weren't really. WDW is great if all you want is burgers, chips, pizzas and ice-creams, but if you're just looking for a salad or something simple that isn't covered in a fatty over-sugared sauce then best you pack your own. The pools were decent, except that poolside eating options were almost non-existent. A very limited menu was available and had to be phoned in (i.e. no waiters), or else you could buy a packet of chips at the poolside bar. Overall, I have to say that the Grand Floridian Resort is not a deluxe hotel. A \"grand\" five storey atrium in the lobby and dressed up doormen can't hide the fact that at its heart this is a very mediocre and tired hotel, worth no more than 3 stars max. If the price was more reasonable then I could probably overlook much of the criticisms above, but as it is I really expected much, much more and was sadly disappointed instead.", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Petersburg, FL", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent Resort\u201d", "Author": "tootles1", "ReviewID": "UR3739056", "Content": "Stayed 5 days and had a marvelous time.

I booked a 2 night stay, Lagoon view for 2 adults and 1 child. We originally wanted a concierge level lagoon view room but these were all taken. The only remaining choices were the lodge tower and a lagoon view room. Since the Lodge Tower rooms don't have a balcony area, we opted for the lagoon view. We arrived at the GF around 8AM, with plans to visit the Magic Kingdom and ferry back to check in at the appointed check-in time. However, after we were greeted at the guard gate of the GF and directed to Valet parking, the truly magical staff at the GF saw to it that we would get our room immediately. The very helpful staff quickly found us a lagoon view room in Big Pine Key, 4th floor overlooking the Polynesian. The bell hop, also serving as an impromptu tour guide, drove us over the grounds and explained each building. He also took the time to explain all of the new rides since I hadn't visited the Disney parks in more than 5 years. Another nice touch was that he also got us a bucket of ice and set the AC for us to an acceptable temperature while providing us with maps of the various parks. The appearance of Big Pine Key was disappointing throughout our stay. The entire bottom floor had seemingly become headquarters for the housecleaning staff who had vacuum cleaners, carts and loads of dirty laundry strewn all over the floor at all times, day and night. Right outside the door was a virtual parking lot full of golf carts belonging to the boisterous maintenance workers who frequently yelled through us to each other. The spectacular lobby that you see in the pictures will not be the lobby you are coming home to each night unless you stay in the main building. The room was a little smaller than expected--and I have had much larger rooms in hotels that cost 1/2 the price. There were two Queen sized beds with the Alice in Wonderland theme and wallpaper that supposedly was hiding Tinkerbell. (We never found Tinkerbell, BTW) The view was outstanding, even if it was not a view of Cinderella's castle. The beds were about what you might expect from a standard hotel - not comfortable and noisy. We heard other guests in the halls but never in adjacent rooms, so noise was not a big factor. The other thing that annoyed me a lot was a constant barrage of golf carts trying to run us over on the walkways in between the buildings and the pool. Every time I tried to walk anywhere I was forced off into the grass by these golf carts, sometimes carrying guests and sometimes carrying workers. I guess the only other complaint was the strong smell of what appeared to be feces or chemicals around the main building facing the pool/beach. That horrible smell remained there the whole weekend. I suspect they sprayed the foliage with some sort of fertilizer concoction. We reported it to the front desk and they were sincerely apologetic. Other than these things, everything else was wonderful. I wanted a smaller pontoon boat to tour the lagoon but the marina said they were under repair - so they gave me the 25' pontoon at the cost of the small speed racers. We spent about an hour in the lagoon which was well worth it. The price was still in the low $30's despite spending 60 minutes cruising around the lagoon. Perhaps they took pity on me and my boating skills. The pool by Big Pine Key was fairly large and nice. We got a chuckle since (to the chagrin of the staff) the local mallard duck population seems to have adopted this pool as their new morning habitat. The main pool (the nice one) is open from 10-10 and it was always packed with people. The slide was very nice for the kids. We went to the spa but quickly found out that, like the restuarants, you need Priority Seating for any of the treatments. In conclusion, I think our favorite part of the GF was the unbelievable staff and the excellent restuarants. This was an experience I am glad we were able to have. Prepare to walk long distances if you stay here to go between buildings and ammenities. The monorail service was quick and we never had to wait more than 5 minutes to catch one. The rooms are well-stocked - although you will pay dearly for any drinks or food in the room. If you are going to spend the money it takes to stay here, you might as well go ahead and upgrade to the concierge level and put in a request for the lagoon view. They will be reluctant to reserve such a room...but they will make note of it when you reserve. The GF front desk will accomodate you, I'm confident. If you are hungry, 1900 Park Fare has a breakfast buffet but Grand Floridian Cafe is much less crowded and has a highr quality breakfast for the same price. Narcoossee's was absolutely fabulous for our 8:30 reservation with window view. Citrico's was also fantastic. Just remember - if you plan to stay here and you are on any sort of budget, just add at least the price of another night's stay for the ammenities, tips and restuarants you will enjoy.

I just returned from 4 nights at the conference and was suprised how dissappointed I was with the quality of service and cleanliness of the room. First, we had been promised tickets and tags for the Disney Magical Express which did arrive once I returned home (actually they came in the same day I left). Once we arrived at the terminal and were directed to the Disney Magical Express, on the Disney employees wouldn't let us in without documentation. Once I explained, he still was insistent and required us to pull out our room confirmations. This was just to enter the line. Then once in line, we were promptly taken to a bus which was very nearly full. I'm glad I wasn't one of those that was first on the bus as I heard of 40-50 min. waits to get the bus full. In full Disney style we received a marketing video on the way on all the great things we could do at the resort. The Disney Magical Express bus was comfortable and clean with more legroom than the plane we had just gotten off of. Upon arrival at the Grand Floridian, we were checked in, but even though it was after 3pm, my room was not ready. Though upon waiting for about 2 minutes, I checked with another lobby attendent and he said it had been cleared. I went up to the room (5510) in Sago Cay and was pleasantly surprised by the decor and ammenities. The room had ample closest space to your right upon entering with two bathrobes hanging above the free safe for storage. The bathroom with two sinks was on the left and the marble countertop was beautiful. It was great to have 4 sets of towels without having to ask for them. Shower and toilet were in a separate room behind and there was a hamper for used towels -- a nice touch to have them out of the way. The main room was small (approx. 200-225 sq feet) but since I was on the top floor had raised dormer ceilings with a ceiling fan. There were two double beds that each had three pillows and several large accent pillows. The room decor was victorian in nature with pastels and several patterns between the walls and the bedding. Lace curtains were underneath the main curtains with a two deck chairs and a small table on the small balcony. I was overlooking the convention center, side lagoon, and the monorail heading off to the Magic Kingdom. The 20 inch TV was in a central wooden unit with multiple drawers. A wood cabinet held the mini bar and extras on the side. There was also a table with two chairs and a dressing bench at the end of one of the beds. Phones were on the table between the beds and in the bathroom. One big plus for staying onsite is the credit program, in which you can use your room key for all purchases (food, gifts, and park tickets) and then clear them up at the end. Also, package delivery is available from virtually everyone in the park and downtown disney (Ghiradelli's was excluded) Upon walking into the room, I did find trash (left over cigarette package in a non-smoking room no less, along with other papers) in the corner of the room, and in the drawer under the phone. I heard of others in our group having clothing left by the side of the beds. I did have a white stain (looked like toothpaste) in the bathroom on the carpet. I threw out the trash myself somewhat surprised, since Grand Floridian has been billed as a 4-5 star hotel and spa, but I can't think of the many times I have stayed at 5 stars - having to throw out someone elses trash. The bed was very comfortable in the evening and slept better than most room. I did not have a problem with surrounding noise, however, many of my friends did due to the thinner walls. One very comfortable feature was the lighting by the bed was on dimmer switches, so waking up in the morning was very pleasant as the lights didn't have to go up all the way. The alarm on the clock was a bit tricky to program (Sony's Dreammachine) since it had two alarms, but after several nights trying I got it working. Turndown service was offered every evening with chocolates left on the bed. The bed was double sheeted which was a great touch. Food is expensive, but the experience seemed worth it. We ate our first night at Narcoosee's for dinner, which lasted until the fireworks, which we watched on the outside verandah, then returned to our table for dessert. Our server was very friendly and accomodating. Once the conference started all I saw was the conference center, which was always well lit and comfortable. Food service was extremely quick and there was no waiting in line, even with a large group of over 300. Overall, I had a great stay at the Grand Floridian, but when I come back to Disney, I will most likely stay at some of the other resorts (Wilderness, Port Orleans, or the suites) as the room sizes are the same -- only the fixtures were somewhat upgraded, but for nearly double the price as some of the other resorts.

This is NOT a 5-star hotel by any stretch of the imagination. The room itself was spacious and comfortable, but we found the previous guest's underwear hanging in the closet upon arrival and partially eaten food in the refrigerator.

We could also hear the theme music from three floors below that started at 6AM every morning. Again, this didn't bother us, but is something to consider before paying these prices. The concierge staff was useless and sometimes downright rude. We asked where the laundry room was located and the reply was, \"You walk right past it every day to get here.\" By the way, that wasn't true. It was actually one floor up in a different wing, something determined when I asked her to look it up on her computer. Otherwise, none of the concierge staff even looked up when guests walked by.

Two CM's were an exception to that out of probably 100 or more we came across. The hallways and some public areas were in need of major TLC. I don't think our room or the hallway outside it were vacuumed once. The monorail service was slow and inconsistent. We also were there during an athletic event- buses to Animal Kingdom and MGM Studios weren't running- but no one told us and we spent over an hour at the bus stop waiting for one. Our room was okay but I found it to be small and unimpressive given the price we paid for it.

My expectation was high, so therefore I thought the hotel was overrated and overrpriced. But I did go back in May with my wife and 4 year old to celebrate Mother's Day and my daughter's birthday. Since I don't get to travel with my family much and this is where my wife really wanted to be - this is where we stayed. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The entrance is beautiful and the lobby is bright and grand. Check in was very smooth and quick and we lucked out with a corner room facing the Magic Kingdom and watched the fireworks from our room every night. Room was spacious, well-decorated and clean. Never did get turn down service though. I thought the grounds and pools were beautiful and every employee we encountered was helpful and greeted you with a smile - without exception. I personally loved the fitness center and spa. Off in a quiet locale and had great equipment and many nice amenities. Thought restaurants at hotel were great. Thought the character breakfast at 1900 Park was so good - we went twice. Excellent breakfast buffet, good service and characters everywhere. Ate at the Floridian Cafe one night too and atmosphere, service and food was excellent. Had room serivce the last morning and that was done well. What really makes the hotel nice too is the type of people that stay here. Everyone is subdued and pleasant. We stayed at Port Orleans once and were so disappointed. Service was horrific, restaurants were uninspiring, and crowd was rough. Have stayed at Yacht Club twice before and did like that hotel as well but even then we were awoken by loud and unruly guests.

Flew into Orlando airport at 10:25pm, and used the (Disney recommended) Magical Express, which is the Disney bus to your hotel (free of charge). However, we waited for nearly 45 minutes to actually leave the airport, and then had to stop at three hotels on the way to the GF. Our check-in was slow; the only clerk on duty (or so she said) had to escort some people to their room - took another 15 minutes. We then had to wait for our bags (it is now 2am) - which Disney is supposed to claim for you at the airport and get them to the hotel. Finally my husband went to find them at the front entrance - my bag was missing and not delivered until morning. Nothing magical about this. So this is my advice - don't use the Disney Magical Express is you want to get to the hotel quickly! The GF is the LAST stop on their route...even if your room costs twice as much as anyone else!! Get your own bags, get a taxi (about $60) and get on with your vacation! The Magical Express will add two hours to your trip! They also want you to check-in three hours before departure, which is a lot if you're making the most of a Disney day. We cabbed it and it took 1/2 hour - arrived at the airport in plenty of time. They will get a cab for you - they're ususally right there waiting...and of course will hold your bags after check-out. Other than these snafus (the GF clerk called them \"technical problems\") we really enjoyed the hotel! Beautiful rooms, clean & friendly service (other than our ridiculous check-in). One other thought: if the weather is nice, it's definitely worth taking the little resort shuttle boat BACK from Disney. During busy times, they leave Disney every 7 minutes or so - and then you don't have to go the circle route on the Monorail - which gets a little old after a few times!

Considering the price of this hotel, we had high expectations! The hotel and pool area are very pretty. We arrived early, around 8am to find out that our room would not be ready until 4/5pm. It was rainy so we couldn't lounge by the pool and the clerk couldn't give us any ideas on what to do with the day. We returned later on that day and our room was ready, I asked for a room of the castle, but was told that we didn't pay enough for that upgrade. I had requested a room with a king sized bed, but was unable to get that also. We could have moved rooms the next day, but we would have had to vacate our room by 11am and it would not be ready until 4/5pm. So, we decided to stay in our room facing the monorail. For $400+ per night, I would expect to not face a monorail and at least have a room facing the gardens. The resort was fine, the service was adequate, but again for that price, it should be well above average. We stayed for 3 nights, but only received turn down service one night. On the night that we did receive the turn down service, our door was left open...not unlocked - open. I tried to call down to the reception area, but was put on hold for over 5 minutes. I then proceeded to the reception area where I was told to go back to my room and wait for a phone call. After finally speaking with a manager, I was told that if there was anything missing, he would be happy to fill out a report. He never apologized for my inconvenience. A motel 6 would even say they were sorry. There were nice parts of this hotel, the convenience to the monorail, the breakfasts at the hotel and the pool. This is my first experience with a Disney hotel. I'm concerned that if this is the best they have to offer, the other ones must be really lacking in service.

We were a little wary of the \"Disney Machine\", but in the end the Grand Floridian won us over. From the moment we checked in, I found the staff to be unfailingly friendly and professional. We were given a complimentary upgrade and had a very nice room on the concierge floor with a great view of the pool area. The room was not large, but exceptionally well appointed and very comfortable - even with a 3 year old running around. We greatly enjoyed the variety offered at the hotel.

Two suggestions: Skip the character breakfast, you'll have plenty of opportunities to see Characters at the park. My daughter cried because it took the characters almost 45 minutes to finally get to her. Second, you can get into the park early if you're staying on the property. If you get there early and take advantage of the \"smart pass\" option, you can pack in some additinoal rides before the park gets full around noon. Kudos to the team at the Grand Floridian.

I had to get some things out of our luggages which was taken for temporary storage while our room (which did not get cleaned after 3 PM) was ready for us at check-in. I went to the bell captain who then gives me the direction to their storage room and tells me to check it myself. So I go in there and I am in between two rolling shelves trying to get my luggage out and then the shelf starts moving towards me! A porter, who had no idea I was behind the shelf started making room on his side to put a luggage in. I almost got hurt. He says sorry but never offered to help me! 5. One of the front desk employees was not only rude to the other guests in line but was also making insinuations to anyone within hearing distance that none of her colleagues was working as hard as she was. She said that they (her co-workers) should be taking in some of the guests instead of her doing all the work. I felt bad that I was being helped by her. 6. We made the mistake of going to the parks first and then going to our now ready room at 10 PM. Well, the luggages were not in our room. We called the front deak and for 1 hour could not get through! If you were to go over there (which is quite a distance), you'd have to be on line for 20 minutes anyway. The bell captain's phone line just kept ringing. So my husband had to walk back anyway to ask for them to bring in our luggages. After one hour of trying to get hold of the front desk, I finally got hold of someone. I told her I wanted to speak with the manager - she said he wasn't in. So I said, have him call me tomorrow. No one called back. 7. Room is blah. Pool is blah. You are better off trying out the Yacht Club where I never had any problem with service. The porters there memorize your name. They greet you by your name each day they see.

We chose this hotel for the convenience of being close to the parks and for the most part it was. We have a 2 year old and an 11 month old. It was very convenient to get to the magic kingdom, but coming back on the monorail we had to go through the other resorts and it took 20 minutes to get back. The boat is MUCH faster going back to the hotel. We took the bus to disney/mgm and animal kingdom and we had to wait about 10 minutes but it was much more convenient then driving over there. The bus to downtown disney took forever - 20 minutes in mid afternoon - we took a cab on the way back because we didn't want to be bothered. I agree with others that the rooms are nothing spectacular for the amount of money you are spending. We've stayed in much nicer hotels for 1/2 this price. But it is disney so we expected it and we weren't disappointed. We got 2 adjoining rooms so that our kids could nap during the day without being disturbed and we had no problem getting the adjoining rooms which was a relief. Our room had a problem in that one of the sinks didn't have cold water but we didn't really complain about it because the other sink worked fine. The rooms are very baby friendly. My 11 month old was crawling around the room and we didn't have to follow him every second to make sure he didn't bump into things. The service was very good - we ordered breakfast every morning through room service so that we could get to the parks early and the food was delivered promply at the time we specified. Food - we did the cinderella character dinner at 1900 park fare. VERY, VERY BAD!!! I wasn't expecting much but the selection and the quality of food was horrible. I had read in the unofficial guide to disney that the food quality was ok but this was by far the worst buffet I had ever eaten! We ate at one other buffet(Hollywood and vine - disney/mgm) and that was so far superior in terms of selection and quality! My family also ate at Narcossees(I didn't go - ate room service with my infant) and they told me that the food there was very good. When we weren't sleeping or resting in our room - we were at one of the parks so we didn't get a chance to use the pool or the facilities very much so I can't really comment except to say that they looked really well kept.

Our room was Pine Key and perfect as it was very close to the main building and both pools. Food in Florida is never anything great compared to our Hudson Valley restaurants so I can't rave about that area of our visit. Ok. Get the ten dollar free refill cups and get as much coffee, tea, soda, juice as you want FREE for your entire stay. Don't order food from the pool bar as it is much more that walking over to Gaspirilla's where you can get a 2.00 pb and j and your free refill. I ordered Coors light by the pool for 5 dollars a few times a day and said \"screw it I am on vacation.\" The pools are Beautiful. If there are towels on the chairs but nothing else, look around and if no bidders, move them and take over. Actually personal items need to take ownership of the chair if they are to be spoken for, and I never had a problem. It rained once and I didn't feel like going to the outdoor \"nonrefundable\" Backyard BBQ. I was fully refunded upon request by the Guest Service. Very classy. Hoop de doo Revue was a blast.
