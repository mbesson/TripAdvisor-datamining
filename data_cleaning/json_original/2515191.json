I hadn't been a guest at the hotel since 2001, and I had forgotten how very charming the hotel is. I have sampled the variety of accommodation available: single room, double room, duplex triple. I like them all equally, although the duplex is pretty special. My daughter joined me on this stay and we occupied a very comfortable double room with twin beds. Our room faced the courtyard, so we weren't bothered by street noise. The floor to ceiling curtains were very attractive and our beds were extremely comfortable. The bathroom (shower only) was spacious and spotless. Breakfast, the only meal offered, is in a small room just off the reception area. The price is a bit high (13 euros), but there is a lot of food: croissants, baguettes, cheese, yogurt, cold meat, boiled eggs, juice, and a variety of hot beverages. If this sounds like way too much food or money, there is boulangerie directly across the street, as well as many cafes in the area. One need not spend nearly $20 for one breakfast. The staff is warm and welcoming. I was especially touched by the greeting one of the staff gave me during breakfast. I hadn't been a guest at the hotel in over 10 years, but I was hugged and kissed by a maid who had remembered me. She was genuinely happy to see me again. I was truly touched. The only down side, perhaps, to the hotel is its location on a very narrow street that is a favorite area, it seems, for American tourists. If you've come to Paris hoping to speak French or be in the company of Parisians exclusively, this is not the area for that. On the other hand, if you find comfort in lots and lots of people from the States and Parisians who are happy to speak English to you, this location is ideal. I like the area because I feel completely safe when I'm traveling alone. The hotel's street is self contained, with nearly a dozen restaurants (including the very popular Cafe St. Regis) and tons of boutiques and other shops. Notre Dame is within a five minute walk; the closest metro, Pont Marie, is just across the bridge. AND, there are several Berthillon ice cream shops along the rue St.- Louis-en-l'Ile.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location on the Ile St. Louis\u201d", "Author": "kathy1966", "ReviewID": "UR126920049", "Content": "My husband and son (age 10) stayed at this great property in room 553, a triple with windows facing the rear.

The hotel has wonderful ambiance and a very comfortable common area. The room was small, but not unexpected in Paris and particularly in an older building. Beds are generally firmer in Europe than we are used to, but this bed was actually quite comfortable. The street that runs down the center of the Ile is perfect for shopping and eating.

I had to make a quick decision about a hotel at the last minute, and chose this one because it popped up on Trip Advisor as an alternative when the Hotel St-Louis-en-l'Isle was not available. I had stayed at the SLI before, and knew that it was not a beautiful place, but it was very quiet and not too expensive. The prices for the Hotel de Lutece were considerably more, but the photographs made it look like a lovely place to stay. That was my fatal mistake. It turns out that most of the photographs are either of the exterior of the hotel, or of the lobby/common spaces (which are all charming). The ones of the rooms make them all look bright and appealing, with some period furniture. There was no period furniture in either of the double rooms (at 195 Euros a night, not cheap) I was shown upon arrival after having made my reservation, unless you consider the 1960s/1970s period. The room I settled into, after the valet de chambre insisted that the brighter room overlooking the street would be noisy, was nestled in between the stairwell and the elevator, which he insisted I would not be able to hear. I heard both loud and clear while awake, but to be fair it did interfere with my sleep. There was also a \"house phone\" in the corridor outside my room that would ring frequently (and loudly) in the morning. And my courtyard room could hardly have been much darker. I read some reviews about the breakfasts, saying that they were very good and a good deal, but I'm not sure what they meant. I thought they were pretty skimpy and ordinary, and rather expensive. I went out for an excellent omelet and better coffee two of the four mornings I was there. I did appreciate them getting me \"pain complet\" (whole-wheat bread) on my last morning, instead of the usual tasteless and nutrition-less white baguette. There are pluses to this hotel. As I said, the location is great. You can get to St-Michel, St-Germain-des-Pres, the Marais and lots of other great neighborhoods very easily. It is also charming to be on a small island in the Seine, and there are many beautiful and historic buildings, including the Hotel de Lutece (on the outside and in the lobby). The staff was unfailingly friendly and helpful, accommodating in every way they could be, and that was much appreciated. But it is a shame that a hotel with such great possibilities does not make use of its many advantages (including rooms with high ceilings and charming beams) to create guest rooms that are in keeping with the style of the lovely building and neighborhood, as well as with the fairly high price asked for rooms featuring formica surfaces, short and sagging beds, a closet with metal, locker-style doors, plastic curtains, and 1970s-style carpeting and furniture. Once again, to be fair, the bathrooms had been more recently renovated and were pretty nice. I'm pretty sure the other two hotels I saw on this street -- the de Lutece's sister hotel, the Deux Iles, and the place I stayed before, the Hotel St-Louis-en-l'Isle -- are in the same boat, though at least the SLI is not as expensive. Surely the Ile St-Louis boasts a really nice hotel? Anyway, failing that my advice would be to find a hotel with more charming, tasteful hotel in the 6th or 7th arrondissement.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cI would stay in the Hotel do Lutece again\u201d", "Author": "KentuckyGabby", "ReviewID": "UR82714857", "Content": "Our stay at the Hotel de Lutece was lovely.

Retail therapy was also readily available with a selection of the type of cute shops the French do so well, full of gorgeous things you don't actually need but have to have.

The bedroom itself was tiny, just enough room for the two twin beds, plus a few feet on each side. The tv was excellent plasma tv. The lovely breakfasts in the morning we wonderful as many review have described. The hotel staff was a \"can do\" type of staff, very friendly, helpful, cheerful, really made you feel at home. Right next door was a grocery store, across the street a FABULOUS cheese shop, up the street the world famous ice cream store. A very charming and quaint street. At the corner I had a lovely drink, again from a friendly, sweet waiter, and my daughter had ice cream. We ate at the Isle restaurant down the street--excellent value and good food; also ate across the street at the Vin Restaurant as recommended by the hotel. That was also charming, and a good value.

The hotel initially refused any compensation despite the fact that their terms were that a cancellation within 48 hours of the date of arrival would result in a cancellation fee of one night's stay. They had most kindly (yes my American friends this is sarcasm) made a reservation for us in the Hotel Notre Dame which I suspect the owner of the Lutece may also own. We didn't darken the door of it but judging by its position - on a main road and not on the Island - and its outward appearance, I wouldn't put up my worst enemy's cat in it.. After my Taiwanese other half spent an hour on the phone with the owner we eventually managed to get the owner to pay for breakfast at another far better four star hotel on the Island. Not even that went smoothly though because the receptionist at the Lutece (decorative but not much else) represented to us that the other hotel would accept a piece of paper on which they had scrawled that the Lutece would pay for our breakfast. They hadn't and they wouldn't. Eventually we got the receptionist at the Lutece to hand over $40 in cash. This ruined the first day of our trip and accordingly I couldn't possible recommend this establishment, which made Fawlty Towers look like a Hilton, to anybody I cared about. I contrast this experience to one I had in Budapest a couple of years ago. There the hotel we had booked had forgotten to inform Expedia that rooms were not available. In fact they found us a room but it was dingy and we asked to be moved to another room. Instead of arguing for a hour like Monsieur Grand in Paris they immediately booked us into the Hilton, a better hotel, paid for the room there and paid for a taxi to take us to it.

It was beautiful. Unfortunately, our hotel was not. I did extensive research and had booked us at four hotels, but chose the Lutece because of the location. The location was perfect, but unfortunately, the hotel was not. I was prepared for a small room, and I had written and asked for one of the rooms on the top floors because Trip Advisor's reviews said they were the largest with the most light. If our room had the most light and was one of the largest, I would hate to see what the other rooms looked like. By the way, we knew the reviews on Trip Advisor were mixed, but we chose the neighborhood. We asked for and got two twin beds, but don't be fooled--these are not your normal twin beds--they are smaller and pushed together. There was room for my husbands suitcase on the floor by his side of the bed, but no room for mine. The room was small, dark and not nicely furnished. The bathroom, however, was pretty large and we were lucky we had a bathtub--some of the rooms did not. I asked if they had a larger room and they were happy to show me the other rooms they had available, but they were worse. We were in room 332 and 333 and 334 were worse (one double bed and no tub). The breakfast room was small and dark, but we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as there were many places within walking distance. The ile St Louis is a charming and beautiful street that is also home to Berthillion Ice cream (not to be missed) and many little shops and wonderful places to eat. We wanted to stay at the Jeu de Paume, but with the weak dollar, we could not afford it. We didn't spend much time in the room (too claustrophobic). We have traveled extensively and knew the room would be small, but it wasn't even charming; it was just too small. Natalie at the front desk was wonderful, however, and recommended a terrific restaurant for our last night and helped us with whatever we needed.
