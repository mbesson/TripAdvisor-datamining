Some of the staff could have been friendlier, but when we left, one staff member took both of our bags over the road and hailed a taxi for us. Lift available to get bags to the office area from the entrance. Air conditioner worked well, modern bathroom, beds a bit hard, rooms a litte small, extra pillows available on request.

The staff checked us in, even though it was only 10 am, without any delays. While the staff was very efficient and helpful, they did not smile much and were not warm. This happened through out my 3 night stay. The porter took us up to our room, which, as I found out was on a renovated floor. The room, had 2 twin beds and a small bathrom. The room itself was small (like many other European hotels), but was sparkling clean and all the furniture brand new. This room felt like it just emerged from the renovation. The room had two smallish windows that looked out to a service courtyrad. The AC worked very well and there were nice amenities in the room and bathroom. All in all it was a great stay. I stayed 2 nights at the beginning of my trip, then one more night at the end. On the third night (at end of trip) we were put in a different room on a different floor. This room was much larger and had a huge balcony overlooking The Gran Via. This room was not renovated yet, and while the furniture and wall paint was tired, it certaily was not bad and this room too was sparkling clean. The location is the best part - the hotel is located just on Grand Via and less than 10 min walk from Puerta Del Sol and Plaza Mayor. You can't beat this location.

I have stayed in numerous hostels costing about 12-15 euros per night that at least provide free wifi. Also, they advertise their gym on their website as a service that they provide. I was excited about this until I called the front desk only to have them tell me that you need a key to access it that costs 6 euros. Who wants to pay 6 euros to work out for an hour? As far as breakfast goes, it is average. I had to wait in line for about 10 minutes just to enter and I've definitely had better breakfasts before. The entire staff here just is not very friendly and clearly don't enjoy their jobs. There are a couple that have been helpful (as I am traveling alone and wanted advice on where to eat) but overall, not very welcoming.

Firstly the location is great, right behind Gran Via and just a short walk to the main shopping areas and nightlife. Excellent location. There a couple of things that put me off the hotel - top of the list is the staff. They have to be the worst I've ever come across in any hotel I've stayed in - incredibly rude and unfriendly and not one bit helpful. One night I made the mistake of asking them for help in finding a restaurant which had been recommended to us . I had the address written down and tried to show it to the guy behind the reception desk. He didn't even look at the address, just gave me a surly look and said I don't know. There were other incidents but I won't go on - just suffice to say that the manners of the staff in this hotel leave a lot to be desired!. Others have said that its a language barrier but in my experience they were well able to speak English when it suited them!. The other issue I had was the rooms are absolutely tiny. Enough room for the furniture and not much else. Not even room for your suitcase without falling over it every time you went to the bathroom!. The hotel can be very noisy also - you can even hear people going to the loo and showering in the other rooms!. We could also hear the maids hoovering the corridor in the mornings and it actually felt like they were in the room with us at times as the noise was so loud! We were woken up on a few occasions very early in the morning which was quite annoying. Other than that, overall its an ok hotel for a couple of days.

Double rooms are a good size and in terms of square footage and amenities are equivalent to those found in other 3-star hotels in this country, both in the capital and elsewhere (and believe me, I've stayed in plenty of Spanish hotels!). Some of the singles, however, are very small indeed (vide the unhappy American whose review also appears on this site), and many of the rooms are what the Spaniards call 'interior', i.e. they look onto a dark and dingy lightwell. When making a reservation guests should therefore ensure that they make a specific request for an outside room ('exterior'), and singles should book a double for single use. The cost of this is rarely very little more than the price of a single (but the rate doesn't usually show up on either the hotel's website nor anybody else's as it's not good business to sell a double for single use at a lower tariff!). The hotel does have a number of double-bedded rooms (as opposed to twins) and again guests should make a specific request for this sort of accommodation (although my request for a double is often overlooked as there are very few rooms of this sort). The rooms are also furnished in a pretty standard manner -- wood floors throughout (with tile in the bathroom), and simple furniture in dark wood of the type so beloved of the Spanish. Bathrooms in double rooms all have a bath, basin, toilet and bidet, although the singles don't usually feature the latter and have a shower instead of a bath. A/C is controlled by a thermostat and dial combo in each room (except for some of the singles on the top floor) and the accommodation is pleasantly cool in summer. During the freezing Madrid winters the central heating is ramped up to the maximum, and it is likely guests would have to turn off at least one of the radiators in their rooms to avoid asphixiating. Bathrooms, rooms, and all public areas are spotlessly clean. I stay at this hotel several times a year while visiting Madrid for professional purposes and I have never, ever come across so much as a speck of dirt. In true Spanish fashion the bathrooms are always bleached so thoroughly that any microbe would be dead on impact. Indeed, so clean are these bathrooms that you could probably eat your lunch from the floor. The property is very well situated for all manner of amenities -- shopping, sightseeing, eating, drinking, etc. This is a fairly straightforward 3-star Spanish hotel that has the advantages of being very clean (although most Spanish hotels are), very central, very safe, and boasts an extremely friendly and helpful staff (and how many places in Spain can boast that?!). Having stayed here on a regular basis for the past many years, however, I can appreciate the comments of some contributors to this forum who state that the interior is a little tired. A full revamp would be a good idea, but until that's done, don't be put off staying here -- provided, of course, you're not a fussy Yank who expects a jacuzzi in the room, a private butler, and obsequious service from all and sundry.

The Hotel was excellent. High stanadard of cleanliness, comfortable bed, wide choice for breakfast from the buffet. Very well placed for sightseeing,( the open top bus just across the road,) and the Metro just down the road. Our view from our window was a bit disappointing, although exactly what I've experienced in Paris, New York and the Savoy in London....namely a fire escape and rear windows of other buildings and a small patch of sky. However as we always spend more time out of the room than in it we didn't mind too much. About pickpockets, this time we were lucky, probably due to a heightened awareness. On his first visit to Madrid my husband had his wallet and credit cards stolen on the Metro going to his hotel. Then 3 days later, while sitting alone at a Pavement caf\u00e9 o on the Gran Via with his back to the road, his lap top computer was taken, from between his feet by someone who must have been walking at the edge of the fast moving traffic! (He didn't hear or feel anything either) His tickets, passport and the Police document reporting the first theft went with it!

The location was perfect, a fabulous view of the entire Gran Via awaits you and it is a stones throw away from all of the shops, bars and the Vision Madrid Tour Bus Stop which I would thoroughly recommend as the most efficient way of getting around the city to see all of the most famous sights.

My daughter and I stayed at the Regente Hotel Madrid for 3 nights. We had a twin room on the 5th floor overlooking the side street. The room was clean and tidy. I think perhaps the rooms and corridor had been refurbished recently. The staff on the Reception were helpful and we had no problems with our booking which we had booked over the internet with Alpharooms. Many of the reviews stated that noise was a problem, we did not experience this. Breakfast was included in the price, with a range of cereal, yogurt, toast, rolls, cold meats etc, the waitress was helpful and the food was replenished as needed. I would say it is a case of getting what you pay for, we paid roughly \u00a355.00 per night, the location of the hotel was good, easily within walking distance on the main tourist areas and close to the Metro stations. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay at this hotel again. One problem we did encounter was pickpockets, I had my purse stolen on the Metro when we were getting from the airport to the hotel. It was stolen as I was trying to board the train, by a couple of children who followed me on to the train and then jumped back off. My handbag was zipped up and I did not fell anything. Please be aware that this can happen. Having spent 2 hours at the police station to obtain an incident report number. It is obvious that this is a problem on the Metro in Madrid.", "Date": "May 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mlebourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - In Need of Refurnish\u201d", "Author": "TYA180", "ReviewID": "UR4394445", "Content": "Just returned from 5 nights in Madrid. The best feature of the hotel is its location, very central. The hotel looks tired and in need of refurnish. The staff were wonderful and would do anything to please you.

I was a female traveling alone and was able to hop on the metro straight from the Madrid airport and get off the Gran Via exit, the hotel was maybe 2 blocks if that far. It has a sign on Gran Via but, is accessed thru a side street. It was nice and clean, easy check in. When I got to my room it was a twin and small. I thought well, just going sleep and shower here, still clean and nice. As soon as I opened my suitcase the phone rang and a gentleman at the front desk said I was suppose to have a double bed and was sending someone to take my luggage and escort me to another room. Right away a man took me to a bigger room, which was clean and a little larger. I was pleased with this hotel overall. A good price (Expedia purchase) and very well kept. If any gripes it would be that my view out of the window was the outside walls of the hotel, no temperature control in room (got warm, slept with window open),extra charge to use the inroom safe, noisy hallways, the room next to mine's door was not even a foot away. When I took a bath one nite, I thought the man next door was in the tub with me when I heard him talk and cough. All in all the staff was great, shopping, restaurants,coffee shops, nearby. Close 2 site seeing, easily could walk to most (Plaza de Mayor, Palacio Real, Plaza Puerto del Sol). Felt very safe walking alone on the streets. Shooters Bar (excellent) across the street. Overall well located, clean and nice staff.

Here are some of our thoughts on the Hotel Regente: 1. Location: Good (not great) location. Next to the Gran Via and within a 15 - 25 minute walk to all major tourist attractions. Near shops, restaurants, and metro. There were many other hotels with a better location than the Regente. 2. Room: Average room. Bed was two twins put together, which my wife did not appreciate. Rooms had incredibly thin walls. We heard absolutely everything (if you know what I mean) that happened in the room to our left, right, and above us. It was very noisy all night. Could not get a good night sleep. The bathroom was clean and a good size. 3. Overall: The room was average. The bathroom was fine. The location was fine. The price was great (50 euros per night). But I probably would not stay there again simply because of the noise at night. If I stay there it would only be because of the price.
