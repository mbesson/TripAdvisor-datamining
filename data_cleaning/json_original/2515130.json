Room for improvement: Definitely something up with the HVAC system. A 2 degree change would cause it to alternate between AC/Heating which led to some loud night time ventilation.

Our room was nice and roomy with a nice view - granted it was of the freeway, but still was nice at night to sit and watch the traffic - no noise at all.

There was no staff around at first and then the one guy we saw just ignored us. We found the bar but the bartender was busy and also ignored us. A waitress finally showed up after we had been sitting a while (we almost walked out but there was no where else to get food) and we ordered a snack and drink. The drink was not what I expected, but not the fault of the staff. They did let us carry our drinks back to our room. The room was nice and had some pluses: flat-screen TV; blow-dryer; large closet; as I said, a nice view of the freeway and some of the skyscrapers; a wall-attached magnifying makeup mirror (a plus in my book) and nightlights, so we didn't have to leave the bathroom light on to see around once the curtains were closed. The main negative for us was it was strictly valet parking and it cost $32 to park - even tho we were paying quite a lot for the room. The valet was quick in the morning to get the car so we weren't late for our clipper ride. All in all, it wasn't a bad stay.

The heating cooling system is ancient, and some rooms have the analog control on the wall which is fine (though I prefer the digital controls like a lot of hotels have) but some rooms have a wall heater that you raise the cover too and it always looks broken, like it either won't close all the way or open all of the way. Some knobs may be missing, hard to turn, etc. My other gripe is the towels. Can they not afford Downy?! Or any fabric softener?! Those things will rub your skin off. Food in the bar is pricey late at night. A basket of french fries was $6.95?! $12 burgers don't come with a side? If this was Boston or NY I could understand, but when there are good eats just footsteps from your property, you would expect better pricing.

Got a really good corporate rate and the room included free wifi and breakfast. As I understand it, compared to the Sheraton and Westin, the Crowne Plaza's rates are far more competitive. A taxi to/from the airport will cost you $39. If you feel like spoiling yourself or are in a group of more than 3, you can opt for a stretch limo for $45. The biggest plus is the location. Minutes walking distance from everything - Pacific Place, Pike Market, Nordstrom, Macy's, Louis Vitton, Gucci, Loft, Art galleries and restaurants. Simply walk to your left when exiting the hotel down Seneca and turn right on 5th Avenue. The Sheraton and Westin are slightly closer but you are only shaving off a couple of minutes. The front desk will supply a walking map. The front desk and concierge was very helpful with directions and suggestions on where to go, shop, etc. The hotel from the lobby, elevators, hallways and rooms are spotlessly clean. Housekeeping is very quiet and courteous. I had left a few personal care items at home and the front desk sent to my room right away. I had a Deluxe King Room on a high floor. Very spacious and great view. The bed was comfy, linens were crisp and bathroom was spotless. I'm not a huge fan of the Crowne Plaza chain's Renu soaps and toiletries, but that's just me. Much better than what Sheraton hotels offer in general, but nothing exceptional. I usually take my own anyway. The breakfast buffet was simple: omelette and waffle station, cereals, baked goods, fruit, meat and potatoes, pancakes, French toast. I was very satisfied with my omelette. If you are looking for a gourmet breakfast, then this is not the place for you. However, is you are looking for something simple with a few options, this is fine. I will stay here again. In terms of rating, I would give this a very high 3.5 - or 4 star, only losing points for not having a spa and gourmet dining.

Occasionally if time allowed I would take the subway into downtown to visit Pike's market etc. I've always told myself that I would stay downtown someday -- unfortunately downtown hotels have always been outside of my company's hotel budget guidance. On this trip, however, I started watching the rates at the Crown Plaza about a week prior to the trip. It was just $9 over our budget and I had high hopes that the rate would drop. Sure enough, a few days prior to the trip the rate fell within guidance and I quickly booked it. I chose not to rent a car this trip due to the hotel's $35/night parking fee. We took a cab to the hotel which was $20 from BFI and took about 15 minutes. Upon check-in the front desk staff quickly recognized our Priority Club Platinum status and upgraded us to mini-suites and provided access to the club level lounge. They also gave us coupons for free internet (lightning fast!), discounted breakfast buffet at the hotel restaurant, and a free drink. The room was a two-room suite right next to the elevators, but I never heard any elevator noise <phew!>. The \"living room\" included a comfortable couch and chair along with an LCD television and a refrigerator stocked with two bottles of water. The desk was adequate and included 3 electrical outlets and a desk-light. The only complain I have about the workspace is the desk-chair. I am 5'10\" and even with the desk chair extended to as high as it would go, the top of the desk came up to my chest. This made it difficult to get some work done. I think the Crowne Plaza would be well served replacing these chairs by something a little more work-friendly. (or I suppose I could have sat on a phone book...) The bedroom includes a very nice, very comfortable king-sized bed. There is another LCD television on the wall, and a deep closet. I questioned how well the room had been cleaned because there was trash and an empty glass underneath the bed (yuck). The bathroom is small, but clean and adequate. Both rooms feature HUGE plate-glass windows that span the entire wall and overlook the city. Just beautiful! The club lounge on the 32nd floor is small but very well appointed. The staff is professional, friendly, and unobtrusive. I haven't had a chance to visit it for breakfast but the evening cocktail hours were nice. They had fresh baked pizza, fruit, vegetables, and warm cookies. Soda and water were free, however beer and wine were available for purchase. (in fairness they did have a nice selection). Tully's coffee was also available in the entryway. The hotel is located between 5th and 6th street. The walk to Pike's market is easy and takes only about 10 minutes. I would love to come back to this hotel with my family because Seattle is such a cool city and, quite honestly, I think that this hotel is better suited for family/tourism than it is for working.

Definitely not up to the standard of a Crown Plaza. ROOMS: Very small and bathrooms are also very small. Shower is over the bathtub with a pull across curtain - most USA Crown Plaza hotels have this type of shower whereby you nearly break your neck trying to navigate stepping into the bathtub. The bathroom door is 4 ft. from the bed head and the toilet is approx 7 ft from the bed head. Difficult to get in and out of the shower as the bathroom is so small. When you flush the toilet it has exactly the same sound as aircraft toilets - Whoooosh!! Sure wakes you up if you flush at night. Bed is ok but the pillows are very small and uncomfortable - we asked housekeeping for larger pillows but they only had the one size. All of the suite rooms back onto all of the 4 lifts so you can expect some noise. The comfort package containes ear plugs! Don\u2019t know what we would do if the fire alarm went off! Windows are not double glazed. The suite rooms are not worth the money as they are small and pokey and the bathroom is just so small. We had a suite which we paid full price for on the priorityclub.com booking site but it's definitely not worth anything like the price we paid which was US$263 per night plus 15.6% tax per night. BREAKFAST: Continental breakfast is provided at the club floor on the 32nd level. Very poor choice available and there is very limited seating. Only the one tray of chopped up fruit is available - not much room on the table for anything else except for a few croissants and buns. Very poor continental breakfast as the Holiday Inn Express hotels would have a much better continental breakfast than this, so, not up to the Crown Plaza standard. CLUB ROOM: Club room is on thr 32 floor and only open from 5pm to 7pm Sunday to Thursday plus also open for breakfast on these days. Only a greasy fat pizza plus one other warm finger food type available plus some chopped up fruit. Coffee/tea, water and fizzy type drinks available. No alchoholic drinks available unless you paid for them. Spirits $8, Beer $6 and glass of wine $9. So, don\u2019t get excited if you get an upgrade to the club floor and don\u2019t bother paying extra for access to the floor as it is not worth it. SECURITY: Reasonable security as you need your key card to operate the lift - we did not see any security guards on duty and the surveilance cameras were only in the receptioin area. POSITION: Good position and about 15 minutes walk to the Pike Street Farmers Market. TOURS: We did the city tour and the Boeing tour which were excellent as we used the tour operator as recommended by the concierge, Christian. These two tours were about the best ones we experienced in the USA as the tour guides were absolutely fabulous and very well informed. The name of the tour operator was \"Tours Northwest\". IN ROOM SAFE: In room safe was available but it was only affixed to the back of the cupboard and not affixed securely to the wall as per recommended installation instructions.

After reading the reviews posted on this hotel I decided to go with it. I must say the reviews were accurate. The rooms were large, clean, with very comfortable beds. Upon check-in they did some re-arranging so that we could have adjoining rooms; which was appreciated. I was a little leary at first, as our rooms were right next to the elevators, but not a problem at all, very quiet. Right next to I-5, so may be a little noisy on the lower floors, but we were on floor 33, so not a problem. Other reviews stated that the elevators were slow, but they must have had them serviced, as we did not wait any time at all for an elevator in our four day stay. Location was great. All sites are within walking distance as well as the free bus, for those who do not want to walk. So, the one negative? The restaurant. We were given a coupon at check-in for a discount on their breakfast buffet. The buffet was limit. Food was ok. Service was horrible. Then we get the bill. I was expecting a $72.00 bill. What I got was a $97.00 bill. They had charged us 18% gratuity for being a party of six and on the original price, not the discounted price. I am not a fan of the mandatory service charge as it is, but at least charge me on the $72.00, that was the price for my breakfast! I would also like a little service as well for the mandatory charge. When I asked about it the staffs only answer was, \"The computer automatically does it.\" We ate at a different restaurant the following day and had a coupon as well; we were charged the 18% gratuity for being a party of six, but the 18% was added after the discount. Much more tolerable. Except for the restaurant all was great.

Our luggage did not arrive with us on our flight to Seattle, and although that is no fault of the hotel or staff, the front desk staff were less than helpful with facilitating its eventual delivery to the hotel, in one instance telling someone who had phoned for us that we were not staying at the hotel when we in fact were, and when the luggage did finally arrive, we were not notified despite being told quite tersely that we would be. When we asked at the front desk we were told very dismissively that there had been no deliveries, and had we believed that we would have unknowingly left Seattle with our baggage still in the hotel due to the lack of ability on behalf of the hotel staff to communicate with us and each other. If the staff were at least friendly, their incompetence could be excused. Aside from this though, Terry the Concierge was fantastic and was streets ahead of the front desk staff, and the location of the hotel is very convenient, as is the free breakfast on the 32nd floor for the rates that include it. If you can pack some spare time, do so because this hotel has won the award for slowest elevators in history!

The location is downtown. Check-in was efficient and keys were available at time of check in at 1PM. They upgraded me to the Club Floor and informed me this was a secure floor. I asked if it would be possible to move me to a lower floor because I had interviews coming the entire next day. They unfortunately said they were sold out and didn't have any rooms but when my guests arrived that all I had to do was call down and they would give them a pass. Since I am from the East coast my stomach was on EST. I was hungry around 330PM and called for room service. They informed me that they could not do dinner service until 5PM but if I called back in 40 minutes they would handle the request. I called back, and they took my order and the food was delivered within 20 minutes. The club floor room was spacious and well appointed. For the price of 110.00 I felt it was an excellent and fair price. Internet was free with an access code. I am not sure if I was given this due to my status or if everyone got free access. Pretty simple access code though. \"priority\" After having dinner and relaxing I tried to stay on EST and fell asleep by 7PM. The one bad experience was the club room was only 50 feet from my room. I could hear people talking, laughing and having a good time most of the evening. The club room is not enclosed, so all sound traveled throughout the club floor. I was awake by 3AM and decided to see if they could possibly move me to a different floor. I explained the noise issue and the clerk 1st said they were sold out. I expressed my concern with the noise and persisted and she said she would see what she could do. Low and behold there was a room available! I moved to the lower floor (19) which was not as well appointed, but was still acceptable. The one thing to keep in mind is this hotel has 32 floors with 3 elevators. I am not sure if 1 or more of the elevators were always out of commission, but I usually had to wait a minimum of 5 minutes for an elevator. They pushed the breakfast in a large number of advertisments throughout the hotel so I decided to try it. The buffet was limited and service was fair. But for the price of 11.95 (which I negotiated at time of payment) was an acceptable price. The hotel does have a gift shop that has a wide variety. I forgot my belt in the hotel the night before in a different city and was worried I would have to go without a belt for my meetings/interviews. The gift shop had belts, ties, etc and saved me!

They never asked for money or made me feel unsafe, but for what it's worth, it's not a great idea for ladies to venture alone late at night. The YMCA is only a block away and the Subway (sandwiches) immediately next door to the hotel attracts a lot of transient people well into the night (I don't know if it's a 24 hr location, but the restaurant was open very late). Again, I wasn't bothered by anyone but it's something to be aware of. The cons, for me, about this property: * no 24 hour doorman or security. I was out late one night and at 2am, there was only one lady working the check in counter and no one else in sight. * no keycard needed to enter hotel - the lobby area is open to the public and even the side entrances don't require keycards. Only the upper \"club\" floors require keycard access in the elevator, meaning that anyone can walk in off the street into the hotel. I didn't see it happen, but I don't feel safe when hotels don't have a security policy * the Concierge wasn't helpful. I spoke with 2 different concierges (at different times) and neither seemed to know the area well. I was looking for a bagel place and a burger place and neither had any suggestions. One recommended a bakery, which was good but didn't make bagels and the other recommended a chain sports bar for a burger. Both were decent suggestions, but as the Concierge, it's your job to know your city a little better and make recommendations. I took a quick look on Yelp and found the best burger in the city was only a few blocks away (try BOKA). * the Concierge also wasn't familiar with city transportation, so I ended up being recommended to take a taxi to the airport. The taxis are supposed to have a flat rate from downtown of $32 but this property doesn't qualify, so it was $48 + tip to get to SEA-TAC * the in-house restaurant food was just plain bad. I didn't have a room service menu in my room, so I walked down to the restaurant, who then referred me to the bar. Everyone was thoroughly perplexed on how to create a \"to go\" order (I would have been fine with room delivery, but they said no). Food was done fast, but it was all pre-made stuff (salad dressing from a jar, frozen burger patty, etc.). The price was fair, since I ordered it in the bar ($2 cheaper than the restaurant) but I wouldn't eat there again.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel With Excellent Staff\u201d", "Author": "skyguyWI", "ReviewID": "UR99586817", "Content": "I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza-downtown Seattle for years whenever I travel to Seattle.

The location is excellent, it is minutes of walk from the major shopping centers, Pike Place Market. I would have to say this hotel can cover many of the popular places in downtown. The room quality is excellent, we were given two queen beds. The room comes with a 32\" TV, a desk, a mini-fridge, wireless internet with a relatively quiet AC. The wireless internet did not work, and we had to call front-desk for a password instead. Another problem with the room is that by the next morning, the windows is full of condensation when the room temp is kept at only 15C. Service is great as well, our hair-dryer is broken. We were given another one in about 15 min after calling the front desk. Since our room is prepaid and check-in and out are very quick. We haven't use any of the services so I cannot comment on others. We get this hotel by random as we bid this online. Value wise I have no other comments except excellent! Sleep qualility is great too, I was able to get at least 8 hours of sleep. The bed and pillow is firm enough that they don't sag. Overall, we are very happy with Crowne Plaza.

Although this may be true and the hotel is similar to its competitors in this respect, I can\u2019t say that CPS is worth what the regular rate is for a room per night. Like most metro hotel locations you are paying for location and branding, certainly not for special perks, free services, free parking or other things I think are necessary to justify a premium price from a hotel. Normally I would not choose to stay at a high-end location such as this on my own dime, however I had a discount available to me, which made the price of the room hard to beat. Upon arriving you are met by pleasant, but visually overworked doormen and bellhops looking to earn a tip. The staff at the front desk is especially courteous, however a computer snafu befuddled the front desk clerk for a few minutes, causing them to ask for the spelling of my name a number of times over and over again and at least one phone call to a supervisor to find my reservation. Crisis averted and reservation found, the clerk returned to her previous calm self and finished my check-in. I had specified a single king bed room, however I was given a 2 double bed room. That didn\u2019t matter too much. It was a corner room with an excellent view of I-5 and the west side of Downtown Seattle. I realized why the corner room also had 2 beds, it was because the non-corner rooms in the hotel are too small for 2 queen beds. The room had the normal toiletries, coffee maker and magazines and guidebooks to the local area. There was also a packet containing some aromatherapy spray, a sleep mask and earplugs. On each of the drapes was a clip, branded as part of the hotel\u2019s \u201csleep assurance\u201d program. I definitely liked the idea and wished that other hotels offered the same thing. The biggest issue with the corner room was the noise from I-5. Oh, never mind, that wasn\u2019t the biggest issue; it was the mattress. The mattress was horrible. The worst I\u2019ve ever slept on in any 4+ star hotel. Every time I rolled around a spring made a pop or whine noise and by morning, my wife and myself were both glad to be done with the night and glad we weren\u2019t sleeping on this bed another night. I was also surprised about the towels. Towels in places like this are typically very plush and generally nice to use. However all of the towels in the room were thin and harsh to use. These towels were worthy of a Motel 6 or Super 8, but not a Crown Plaza. The towels were clean and bright white, but a location of this caliber should have had much better linens. Bed linens weren\u2019t much better. I have nicer sheets at home and I purchased them from Costco. In general the Crown Plaza Seattle left me with mixed feelings. If the place was a 3 star property or lower, then the mattress, towels and bed linens would have been excusable, however that just isn\u2019t the case. A high-end downtown property that prides itself in being a 4-star or better location should do much better in all the above areas.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at Crowne Plaza Seattle!\u201d", "Author": "shopaholicinvan", "ReviewID": "UR84686872", "Content": "We had a girl's weekend shopping through Seattle and my friend booked Crowne Plaza Seattle (CPS) on Hotwire for a one night stay in June.

This was around midnight and the phones kept ringing and ringing. She then called concierge, again, it kept ringing. No answer at the valet desk either. We tried again in 10 minutes and again, no one answered their phones. Same went for the next morning when we tried calling valet. We called back 10 minutes to hear an out of breath valet answering the phone. There's only one attendant on duty at 9am? The bathroom also lacked a fan so the room became quite muggy. The tile used in the bathroom was also slippery; be careful if you step out of the shower. There also wasn't a place to hang your towels; only the shelve above the toilet (which isn't the most sanitary location). CPS also had slow elevators. It took over 10 minutes to finally hail an elevator from Ground Floor. There are only two serviceable elevators and while we were waiting, we came across the hotel manager who gave up after 5 minutes and left after we commented to him that the elevator is slow. This was especially a problem around dinner time when there were 30 people waiting in the lobby for the elevator. We gave up and sat in the lobby to wait until the crowds cleared.

We reserved a junior suite but arrived in the morning so our room was not ready. The bellmen agreed to take our luggage and the front desk staff told us they would call us when the room was ready. We walked to Pike Place Market (about 8 blocks in all) for shopping and lunch, and the hotel called before 3 pm to inform us that our room was finally ready. The service overall was outstanding--from front desk check-in and other help, to the bellmen, to the restaurant wait staff to the housekeeping crew. Housekeeping checked in on us regularly, keeping us regularly supplied with things we needed, and even offered turn-down service. We've stayed at alot of very good hotels, but this hotel's staff stood out! The suite was very clean and comfortable. Like most hotel rooms, many things just don't make sense--like the rooms were laid out or designed by an interior designer and not by an architect. There was a large bedroom and closet but no dresser to put your clothes in. There was just one hook in the bathroom. And why don't hotels put a small coat closet next to the front door (instead of one large closet in the bedroom)? A couple nice touches included drapery clips to keep the light out in the morning, and welcome kit that includes a bed spread spray, ear plugs, etc. The hotel's location is very good but not necessarily the most central. It is a 6-10 block walk to Pike Place Market, the water front, Aquarium, and Pioneer Square. Safeco/Quest Fields and Seattle Center are much further off and pretty much require a taxi. Being in a primarily business area, there isn't much going on around the hotel itself. Being right next to I-5 was quite convenient for our friends picking us up to go the Museum of Flight (a 15-20 minute drive south of the city). Noise from the freeway wasn't noticeable during our stay. All things equal, I would've preferred to be closer to the water front, Pike Place Market or Westlake areas, but this hotel's location isn't too bad. The main complaints we had during our stay both centered on the elevators. First, there are only THREE elevators to service the entire 30+ floor hotel! Waits for the elevator can be a bit long. Second, our suite was located directly next to the service elevator and it sounded like a distant train coming most of the time. The noise was not pronounced but noticeable from parts of the suite. I also didn't like being charged for high-speed internet access but this isn't the only hotel that still does this. In general, my opinion is that hotels should stop trying to make money in this day and age on a standard, commodity service like internet access.

Will not dwell too long on the bad as the hotel management worked really hard to overcome these and were most considerate. The feeling is that they should not have happened. The biggest disappointment was that we had been looking forward to our stay and it was just a little bit of a let down. The front desk staff were a just not functioning and if they could get it wrong they did. Our first night late check in after a 27 hours of travel and a 9 hour time difference was a nightmare. On the other hand Silver from the front desk team, Terry the Concierge and Cristy Smith General Manager were superb. We had a Suite 3156 for the first stay and really were very disappointed at the shabbiness and age of the fixtures fittings etc. An overhaul is long due. On our second stay we had 3356 and this had been marginally updated but was still not all one would expect. On the bright side everything was very clean, a more than ample supply of towels and the usual superb Crowne Plaza beds. The Executive Lounge is too small for the number of rooms described as \"Executive\". It too is desperately in need of a total overhaul. We were most amused when at 3.30 in the afternoon standing beside the sign stating that the lounge is open 24 hours for the use of Executive Level guests to be told by a staff member \"We only open at 5\". We quickly discovered that if one was walking to the hotel from the front area the best way was to always use Pine Street and then along either 5th or 6th Avenue to Seneca. The other nearby roads all had pretty steep hills back to the hotel. If you are in the Piers area a good tip walk along to Piers 62/63 near the aquarium and use the elevators up to the Pike Street Market area unless you like lots and lots of steps to climb.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falls Church, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood choice!\u201d", "Author": "BDiaz", "ReviewID": "UR34679916", "Content": "Because my SO and I were taking an Alaskan cruise departing from Seattle and we have never been in Seattle, we decided to arrive one day prior to our cruise. Since we were short on time, I decided to book a hotel in the downtown area. I was looking for a hotel with a price range of $150 to $200 (including taxes) therefore, after looking at the reviews in trip advisor regarding different hotels; I decided that The Crown Plaza was a good match for us. I found out that the Crown Plaza is one of the few hotels that offer a nice Pre-cruise package. We booked the Pre-Cruise plan with a King size bed. The room was located on the floor 27 and it was a corner room. We were able to see most of the downtown area and the Space needle from our room. The room and bathroom were very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. We arrived at 11:30 AM and our room was not ready, but we were able to leave our suitcases with the door man and go to explore the city. By the time we came back to the hotel (around 5:00 PM) our room was ready. As part of the package, breakfast and transfer from the hotel to the pier were included. The breakfast was a buffet breakfast and it was good. As a matter of fact I really enjoyed the coffee that was served during breakfast. I even asked the waiter where I could buy that kind of coffee in Seattle, the waiter told me that he did not know but he was going to ask. A few minutes later, the hostess came to our table and she gave us as a gift, a bag of (1/2lb) of their coffee. I was very impressed by that. The service at the restaurant was very good. The staff at their front desk and the lady in charge of scheduling our transportation to the pier was very friendly and courteous with us. Unfortunately, some of the customers who were in the reception area were very unfriendly and uptight. The only complaint that we had was regarding the Wi-Fi connection. The service is not free, my SO was trying to update his Facebook status and check his e-mails and we did not want to pay the extra $$ for that service. Fortunately, he was able to pick up a free Wi-Fi connection when we were strolling in downtown. There are hundreds of Wi-Fi networks out there. So, in conclusion, I liked this hotel and it provides good value for the money.

This is a 34-story hotel with 4 elevators, 3 of which were working during our stay (we were told that they are in the process of replacing all elevators). This, along with the very small lobby, resulted in horrible crowding as guests wait 5 minutes or more for an elevator. To avoid missing a shuttle bus that we booked, we had to leave our rooms 30 minutes before departure time. All elevators going down were completely packed, so we had to ride the elevator up to the top (stopping on every floor), then back down (again stopping on every floor).

Staying on the executive level provided us with nice amenities such as \"quiet zones\", complimentary evening hors d'oeuvres, bottled water, complimentary continental breakfast, a room safe, mini fridge, among others. The only reason why I did not give this an excellent rating was the elevator issue. They have four elevators, but only two were in operation, which made it very slow going! Fortunately whenever staff saw us waiting, they allowed us to use the faster service elevator they use themselves, which is another reason to laud the great staff at this hotel. Valet parking is $30.00 per night, which is standard for a downtown Seattle hotel. Parking is secured, which is better than at the Hilton.

Overall, the hotel was fine in all the basic categories: the rooms were fairly nice, comfortable beds, nice LCD TV, clean, and so on. The hotel has a good location. It's only about 10 minutes walking -- leisurely -- to the waterfront and you can walk to Qwest or Safeco field if you've got the time. Similarly, Seattle center isn't far and can be reached by mono rail about 5 blocks from the hotel. So, why the middling review you say? We booked on Hotwire, so we were paying less that $100 a night for the hotel. Any more and I would've been a little more disappointed. The biggest complaints I have are the incidental charges. Now, I know 'there are no free lunches' but I have not stayed in a hotel in years that didn't provide WiFi in the room rate (it was $9.95 for tv internet and, I think, the same for a regular lap top connection). The hotel's parking garage is valet parking and goes for $35 a day. I thought this was outrageous until I discovered how much parking costs everywhere in Seattle, but really the parking was nearly half as much as the room rate PER NIGHT. I read on another review too that elevators take a long, long time and this is true, but not the type of thing to upset me much. Rather, I don't like being 'nickel and dimed.' I'd say the hotel is acceptable, not as affordable as it looks, and I probably wouldn't stay again based on the combination of the two.

When I arrived at this hotel in mid-afternoon I was told there were no rooms available to match my reservation request (king bed). After extensive negotiations, a king room became available, albeit a handicapped room. The hotel was selected for a group meeting, and as we gathered for our meeting, conversations centered around the 'need to fix' elements of the hotel. So while it could be said this review is based upon a single individual's experience, our group of twenty confirmed their disappointment with the hotel. The list: - Low water pressure - plan an extra ten minutes for your shower. - Hair dryers were old and had little drying power. I gave up after twenty minutes (usually five minutes or less with a decent hair dryer) as it was raining in Seattle anyway. As an added bonus, when you turn on the hairdryer, the bathroom lights flicker. - There are FOUR elevators on the main floor, however the room floors only have access to TWO of the elevators. One elevator only worked stopping at each floor ASCENDING and didn't stop on DESCENDING The second elevator did stop at descending floors, yet was packed with people. After waiting 10 minutes for an elevator, I opted to get on the 'going up only' elevator, that stopped at every floor (32 of them) then quickly descended to the main floor. NOTE: the hotel staff did admit work was being done on the elevators, however two working elevators for a 32 story hotel is unacceptable. - Room carpet needed cleaning, and the dark walls and decor prompting turning on every light in the room to navigate. Hotel room colors are brown, dark orange, and medium yellow. - Lounge wait staff was very friendly, and service was good. - This hotel is right off the freeway and if you're traveling by taxi, it's easy to get out of the cab and enter the hotel. If you're renting a car and staying at the hotel, there is no space in front of the hotel to leave your car, check in and park. So plan to park your car in the garage and then take your bags with you to check in to the hotel. - If you're okay with horns honking, the freeway exit ramp is located at the hotel entrance, as well as a major left turn from a main street.

I went down the hall and heard some people in one of the rooms and knocked. They let me use the phone to call the front desk. A security guard showed up in 3 - 4 minutes! He used the service elevator which apparently is never freed up for the public. The elevators were the only complaint I had during my stay there.

I had reserved a view room, and was able to check-in immediately upon arrival, about noon. Although I had not paid the higher rate for a club level room, because I am a Priority Club Gold level member, I was given access to the club lounge for continental breakfast and evening snacks. There was also access to a microwave for making popcorn at night. The view room was on a high floor (30) and overlooked the city and bay instead of the freeway. Worth the extra $$. It was a large room, with a desk/chair and an additional arm chair. The location was in downtown, close to shopping areas. BUT, everywhere to walk is downhill, which means it is a long uphill walk back. Pike's Market is definitely walking distance to get there - but I took a cab back up the hill. I was taking in Sox/Mariners games at Safeco field, and Safeco (and the adjacent Quest field) are about a 20-25 minute walk. The Concierge was not terribly helpful with directions or information on local buses --- just suggested we walk. The rooms were standard Crowne Plaza rooms: fluffy white linens, extra pillows, etc. I think in some other CPs I have stayed at the mattresses may have been pillowtop, but not this one. The mattress definitely could have been more comfortable. The rooms were very clean. Housekeeping serviced the room twice a day: in the morning they made up beds and replaced towels; later, they returned early evening and turned down the beds, closed the drapes, replaced any used towels and turned the radio on softly. I did not dine in the restaurant, but ordered room service twice. Both times I ordered just sandwiches, but they were good and arrived quickly and hot. Room service is available late - until about 1AM. The breakfast in the club lounge was more than adequate. There was a large selection of bagels, muffins, danish and scones, assorted cereals, assorted fruit and choices of coffee, tea and juices. The lobby was always extremely crowded during the day. There seems to be a convention of some sort going on, and they had taken over several function areas as well as the lobby. The biggest problem was the elevator service. The hotel was quite full due to this event. While there was a bank of 4 elevators visible, it appears that at least one was locked down for service use, and another may have been out of service. I never saw it operating. That left 2 slow elevators to service a full 34 floor hotel. One evening I returned around 11PM to literally find a line of folks across the lobby waiting for elevators. It took me 25 minutes to get up to my room. Even more annoying was that the hotel staff seemed unconcerned by this and did not open up the service elevator. At other times there were quite long waits, but 25 minutes was the worst. Overall, I liked this hotel. Next time I may look into staying somewhere a bit closer to the waterfront, but if the rate was better, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Crowne Plaza again.

The extras like the sleep kit (lavender spray, ear plugs and face eye mask) and clips to hold the drapes closed were a nice touch. The food at the restaurant was excellent, and fairly priced for Seattle. If my kids were with me, I probably would have selected somewhere less expensive because there are so many great restaurants in the area. I loved the workout room,-- had great equipment, two TVs and bottled water.

They give you may extras like unbelievably comfortable beds with down duvets, night lights, clips for the curtains, sleep kits with CD, earplugs and eye shades (none of which were needed) and free coffee and Twining teas.

We had a room on the top floor (club level) with the complimentary breakfast / evening snacks & we had no gripes whatsoever. The view was incredible - the space needle & city lights at night just beautiful & the morning sun over the water amazing. The hotel is well located & easily accessible to the main department stores / downtown shopping. Yes, its a little walk to Pike Place & the Space Needle but certainly not miles & its a rather pleasant walk. We hired a car for 2 days & visited some out of town malls as well as the Boeing factory (awesome) & the Microsoft campus. We did go up the space needle & ate in the restaurant one evening - whilst the view was great, the food was only OK & you really are paying for the view (which incidentally, is not half as good as the view from the CN tower in Toronto), so I'd think twice about eating at the top of the Space Needle.

We were able to get the government/military rate since my husband is active duty Army, which was around $170 for a club level room, which was supposed to include free evening appetizers and a free continental breakfast. We figured that was a good rate for a room on a high floor and basically four free meals, but little did we know that the club level lounge is CLOSED on Friday and Saturday nights! So we got two free breaksfasts. We did receive a coupon for one free appetizer in the Regatta Lounge (the bar inside the hotel) upon check-in. Another problem that we had was that the guest that had stayed in the room we were to occupy that night apparently did not check out. This was the day after the nightmare at the airports because of the foiled terrorist attack, and so I can understand someone changing their travel plans, but they tried to put us in a room that was subpar to what we had reserved. After a few choice words, the manager \"found\" a room on the 32nd floor and gave us one night of garage parking for free, a $27 value. We had suspicions that this room was probably in the remodeling stage, as there was a loose tile in the bathroom floor and a few small cracks where the ceiling met the walls. Even with the loose tile, the highlight of the room was the bathroom - all marble, new fixtures, a great shower, and lots of towels and toiletries. The other highlight was the bed, which was very comfortable. A few nice touches include the sleep kit, with a music CD and an eye mask; the blackout curtains, which fooled me into thinking it was still dark outside when really the sun was already up; and the hotel escape plan on the door actually lit up at night. It was a very faint light and didn't disturb our sleep at all, and I had never seen this before. I thought it was very clever. I didn't think the elevators were slow at all; we waited one time for maybe three minutes, but otherwise it was just a few seconds. They have a pretty good happy hour in the bar twice daily, and the hotel is within walking distance to everywhere. Even though we could take our car as often as we pleased, it didn't move for two days because we walked everywhere. Overall it was okay, but I think there are nicer hotels downtown for about the same price. If you are in town for a conference and don't really care about the amenities, then this hotel is for you. But if you want to be pampered, go somewhere else. Last year we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, and it was absolutely great. If you can afford it, stay at the Fairmont Olympic - it is divine. If you can't afford it, do what we did and just walk through.

I also could not find any open access nearby, even if I sat in the window. The hotel has a self-serve business center, but charges way too much. Beware: you cannot upload files from the computers in the business center. I needed to send a document on my jump drive, and the computer displayed a \"blocked\" message. 2) The six elevators are VERY slow. You could easily wait ten minutes or more for one to come. You can always take the stairs, but that's not always an option if you're on the 14th floor (I was) or above. Ice machines are located on every other floor; as with soda machines. Soda is $2 for a 20oz bottle. The ice machines are very noisy and are inclosed in a room with a door. There is a large fan next to the door to provide ventilation to the room, which adds to the noise. Due to the size of the hotel, there are very few rooms on each floor. This means that it's very quiet. At almost any hotel, you're going to get some noise. I was pleased that the only thing I heard was one of my roomates snoring. This was easily drowned out by the sleep kit that the hotel provides on the first night. The kit contained ear plugs, an eye mask, a relaxing sounds CD (didn't listen to it), and lavendar spray. Also, the windows are very well insulated, almost no noise or cold came in. The couches in the lobby are very very comfortable; I could have slept on them. The in-house confernece facilities are small, but are very nice. My limited interactions with the hotel staff were pleasant. I didn't need much from them, so I had no reason to speak with them. Extra sheets were delivered within 10 minutes. The hotel guarentees wake up calls within 5 minutes or your stay is free, so you might as well get one. They lived up to their claims. The hotel is within walking distance of many other hotels and downtown attractions. It is only two blocks away from the main bus line. The busses are free inside Downtown Seattle. It is very convienent to hop on a bus and get off in 2 blocks, but the busses don't run this far east, so you have to walk 2 blocks. Getting to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center was very easy thanks to a shortcut pointed out by one of the attendees. I don't know what the name of the building was, but it's the one at 7th & Union. There is an underground retail center where free WiFi was available. Overall, I'd stay in this hotel again.

Yes, you can find a cheaper day rate elsewhere, but we didn't see any lots in the area that charged less than $22 for 24 hours. There is so much to explore within walking distance from the Crowne Plaza, we just left the car with the valet all weekend. We ate breakfast in the hotel both mornings. The service was good but the food was mediocre. And given that Seattle is home to Starbucks and many other coffee suppliers, the coffee was dreadful. There are surprisingly few restaurants that serve breakfast close by that aren't in hotels, and at least by eating at ours it was convenient and fast. This hotel is very well located for exploring downtown-wonderful window and high end shopping, and bargain shopping at Nordstrums Rack and Ross. It only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Centre where Experience Music Project, the Aquarium, and Science Centre are located. Exploring EMP can take an entire day, especially now that there is a new Science Fiction Museum there.

However, we didn't really hear too much noise from the hallways or elevators because the air conditioning was pretty loud and covered the outside noise. We had a 2 double bed room, with a nice view of I-5. My son loved the view because he could see the cars on the freeway. We asked for a King Bed, but the lady at the front desk said they didn't have any available. I'm also wondering if people who book through Hotwire get the rooms by the elevators? Because my mom also was assigned a room by the elevator and she booked through Hotwire. The room itself was pretty spacious. Enough room for my 2 1/2 year old son to play with his toys. However, the bathroom was pretty tiny. The shower was regular sized and with good water pressure. Conditioning shampoo, mouthwash, lotion, and facial soap were supplied.
