I was only able to get a partial refund from E-x-p-e-d-i-a by promising once I got back from my convention I was going to take them to small claims court for false advertising. The photos look nothing like what the place is really like. The teller hides behind bulletproof glass, the tv didn't work, the phone and remote were missing, the main lamp didn't work, the place smells like butt, the carpet is nasty, there are prostitutes hanging at the hotel at night. I feel lucky I wasn't mugged of my laptop. Any good reviews of this hotel have to in my opinion be by the owner. The only business I am guessing they get is from people who basically live their and people who get suckered in online. This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.
