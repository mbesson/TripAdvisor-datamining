My cell, sorry room - no I was right the first time was a small L shaped area with a toilet/shower area, a little galley kitchen (not sure why) a small desk with a hard wooden chair and what would be classed in the UK as a three quarter bed. More of a Prince sized bed than a King Sized. The shower cubicle was about 30\" square with a shower curtain which immediately attached itself to my rear end and refused to let go. I had a bath towel and a bath mat - one of each, the first night and had to ring housekeeping the second night to get even that. There were no pictures or anything on the pained walls,, just a couple of scuff marks. My room was on the third floor at the front of the hotel and I was not happy that Jensen Button was practicing hill starts outside most of the night. If not him then that Michael bloke.

I had to book a room in Dubai but was \"late\" as I booked 7 weeks ahead of time using Expedia, the 4 star Tamani Hotel Marina. Normaly I take a Marriott but the Tamani was only a 3rd of the price and I thought to smart. Reading the rates at the Expedia I should had have doubts as a +/-20% complained at a 4/10 while others reported roughly 8/10, my mistake to believe the last group. The receptionists are all lovely but not really smart/honest. Knowing the negative rating from a few guests I told them I would not be pleased with a room they stayed in. That was not the case they told me, but what they gave me? Room 301, white stone dirty floor, I think 15 square meter bedroom and 6 in the bathroom. Airco blew air but not cold, separate water heating system for the shower, noisy above imagination. I thought not to complain and just enjoy this hell hole however the whole night I could hear people so clearly if they where next to me. Also they where working with loud machinery and I could hear cars. On top of that the smell of food, the whole night! The morning after I complained and asked another room but sort fully booked. Night number two, same story and I stated my Indiana Jones adventure on floor #3. At 11pm I found out that my floor was next to a big separation door and behind this unlocked door in the hallway there was a car parking....it seemed that the first 3 floors of the building where originally build as a car-park but they changed that to rooms however not all. Dangerous, against any safety regulation I can think of and not the last not really a comfortable location for any guest you would say? I ventilated my anger to the reception desk but no way that I got another room, fully booked sir! Next morning I complained again and asked for the duty manager, not on duty, sorry sir please call us after 9. So I did but after 15 minutes talking to every member of the reception desk they understood I was not pleased and got the director on the phone. He apologized and arranged to provide me another room on the same floor. #326, same price but 50 sq. meter, clean, airco that works and close to the emergency exit what I asked for before I even booked as I have a hotel fire experience. So what did we learn? Always take a hotel from a known global chain, Marriott or Hilton has a high standard and corporate control. It helps to complain and keep on doing that until they solve the problem.

This \"hotel\" basically caters more to long-term guests rather than short-term tourists. Check-in was a disaster because of 2 things: 1) check-in receptionist was attending to me, but decided to assist her colleague with her check-in, so decided to just tick some boxes on the check-in form and slam it in front of me WHILE talking to the guest from the next counter, expecting me to auto-pilot and know what to do with it. 2) the room wasn't ready at 2.45pm, when the email confirmation clearly stated 2pm. She even tried to come up with a 3pm check-in rule until I pointed it out to her that it is not what was sent to me. Was sent away to \"wait for an hour\" for the room to be ready. While waiting at the lobby, she came up to me later and offered some complimentary drinks at the coffee house Nar and Hail (interesting name for a cafe), and the keys to the room duly sent to me at the cafe about 30 minutes thereon. Room was nothing to scream about except that it is as huge as the website say it will be. It is a serviced apartment after all (not a hotel suite as they make you believe). Housekeeping definitely needs more training to clean the room, from the window sill to the carpets to the kitchen utensils to the sofa... 4 toilets (2 with bath facilities, 1 with standing shower, 1 powder type room). The standing shower and powder room smells of sewerage it would make you go crazy spending more than 2 minutes in there. Called reception during the stay to enquire about free parking for guests, but she either didn't understand the simplest of English, or the staff here are just trained to annoy you. When I asked about free parking, I had to repeat it a few times, before she snapped back at me \"free parking of what?!\". It felt like a 'how many receptionsts does it take to change a lightbulb' moment. I gave up talking to her. Went to my car and drove away, and yes, it is free. The spa facilities are what you would expect of an overly used shared condominum. Jacuzzi doesnt work, and the indoor pool is full and uninviting when you have 3 people in it. Outdoor pool too cold for swimming this time of the year. Sauna and steam is there, decent. Check-out was another fiasco with one of the rudest receptionist I have ever met. Was told to wait for housekeeping to check the room, waited for about 15 minutes before I went up to the reception and was told to wait somemore, before another staff member said the call already came 10 minutes ago and the room is ok. Communication obviously doesn't rank very highly with the hotel. Overall an extremely unpleasant stay. Will avoid this like the plague.

I had booked a room through an Internet-based travel website. I was surprised to see such an amazing rate at a \"five star hotel.\" I guess not all rooms in a five star need to be high level.

The bathroom was not only minuscule, the shower curtain smelled like urine and there were hairs on the toilet when I checked into the room. The room had a kitchenette with fridge, electric kettle, instant coffee/tea, glasses and cutlery. And there is a Carrefour Supermarket right next door. The location is convenient to Dubai Marina. The decorative features were obviously cut to fit such a small room. The drapes, furniture and bedding were nice, however, the finishes were not (such as the tile floor of the room which looked like it belonged in a bathroom). House keeping was very friendly. Most of the staff at the front desk did not even think to interrupt their gossip session when I arrived or approached them for advice (there were two guest services members who were the exception). I am not sure if there is public access to the beach from this hotel. Luckily I had a friend staying across the street at the beautiful Westin.

We didn't have breakfast included (room has big fridge and even freezer). Hotel staff was friendly and ready to serve. Also everything was clean. I believe you can purchase many kind of services through them. Swimming school at least looked popular. There is no bar or much space to spend times on common areas (except pool). Hotel has shuttle services, but we found it practical to take taxi in front of the hotel. Nakheel metro station you can walk to and also Marina Walk is reachable by walking. We did walk even to Marina Mall, but it is bit far away. There was specially road construction going on next to hotel, but you can find route through it even by walking. We had view to big road and some noice from traffic reached our room, but no problem with construction. Basically only complaint I have is regarding towels in room. There was only 2-3 each day even though there was 4 of us.

The hotel was advertised as the tallest all room hotel in Dubai. I was expecting nice views and a bit of luxury. Well it wasn't quite like that. On arrival I was a bit taken aback when they put a credit hold of 500 AED on my credit card as security against the bar fridge. I ended up with a studio room on the third floor looking out on a construction site. The room was tiny, barely room enough for the bed. The bathroom looked a bit run down and had only a shower. The shower was tiny with a flimsy shower curtain that you had to draw around the small square shower. After a 14 hour flight I was hoping to relax in a hot bath. Because of the construction happening around the site, there wasn't any place you could walk to. There were two swimming pools, one indoor and one outdoors. They were too small to do laps in. When I was checking out, I had to wait for a room check to complete to make sure I hadn't taken anything from the bar fridge (the bar fridge barely had anything in it either and would have had a max of \u00a310 worth of bottles, if that).

Then there were the staff at the restaurant who entertained our little girl for ages in the morning so we could have a decent breakfast. Bassim - thank you so much for being so helpful. Then there were the rooms. I urge you to get sea-facing room as it will spare you the construction noise from the back. The views are also amazing. But the rooms themselves are just huge. For a family there's nothing better than being able to make yourself at home away from home. The kitchen, washing machine etc were also really useful. I would say that there is a lack of utensils in the kitchen- there were no pots and pans, not even any mugs. Plus oddly, they don't provide black tea - only peppermint teabags - which for an English person proved very odd. Lucky there's a store nearby so we could stock up.

I was there 5 nights but never had a decent night's sleep - the thick winter duvets, completely inappropriate for a desert hotel and the construction noise (which starts at 4.30am) saw to that.

It was a great stay. The hotel is ideally located in Dubai Marina around half an hour from the airport with breath taking views of Palm Jumeriah and the Atlantis. There is a supermarket behind the hotel were you can stock up on groceries, bread, cold drinks and water. The staff were ever so helpful and accommodating. We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment on the 15th floor and the apartment is extremely spacious and well decorated. We could not fault the hotel at all. The apartment had 1 room with twin beds, 2 rooms with queen beds and 3 bathrooms. They also had a laundry room and guest toilet with shower. The kitchen was huge and fully equipped with plates, cups, etc as well as a mini bar. If you wanted to cook, all you need to do is ring up housekeeping and they will bring you the pots etc that you need. However, as we were on holiday we did not opt for the self catering option but instead bought whatever we needed and had this in pur apartment. The hotel restuarant Nar and Hail is also really good and the food well presented and tasty. The hotel is close to the Marina Walk will 100's of shops and restuarants and an amazing buzz with the nigh markets on weekends. The hotel also offers a shuttle service to Atlantis, Jumeriah beach, Dubai Mall, Mall of Emirates (MOE) and more. We used this service and it was punctual and effecient. The hotel has an excellent concierge that arranged dinner for us at the Burj Al Arab. I had also read alot of reviews of how hard it was to get taxi's in Dubai but we never had a problem and the 7 of us used one MPV. The hotel had taxi's available all the time outside of the reception and getting around was no problem. We took the shuttle to the MOE and than a taxi back. The mall had an extremely effecient way of handling the taxi's and directing the people. Since they only had a normal size car and we needed a MPV, they guy at the taxi stand called for a MPV and we got one within 5 minutes. It was amazing. Tamani hotel is definitely a family friendly hotel and good value for money. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definitely return to this hotel next year.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for couples & families\u201d", "Author": "Calrav", "ReviewID": "UR53004786", "Content": "This is one of the best places I visited.

They have a shuttle that takes you for free to all of the main attractions, although the times that it comes and goes are limited. My only complaint was the concierge could have been more helpful planning our excursions. Highly recommend the suites... very luxurious with a full kitchen and washing machine. The fitness center is also very nice and opens early/late. There is a deck pool, but it was a bit too cold outside in late December to use it.

The refrigerator was not fully stocked, i had to call for them to bring the 'mini bar' items. Every time we passed through the lobby we were ignored by front desk staff, no acknowledgment at all. Upon check out we inadvertently left items in the bedside table. 3 calls were made all resulting in the same answer: \"nothing has been turned in\". How do we know they even looked?

We have been to Dubai twice before and stayed in a different 5* hotel which was great but this hotel is definately not a five star may be 3 star the most. The staff was friendly but it lacked the luxury/style of a five star hotel. We were given a apartment with 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms/4 toilets which was more than what we needed. My daughter went into the shower and found the water was hot only for five minutes so shampoo in her hair had to be washed out in cold water. It was fixed after a day. The apartment came with a kitchen so we could have toast and cornflakes in the morning but cleaner did not clean the kitchen and one of the bathroom until we left some tip in the room. Before booking I called the hotel to enquired whether it was linked with a private beach and I was told it was but they failed to tell me that ther is around \u00a330-40 charge if we wanted to use the private beach facilites so paying for 4 people twice during our time was quite a hafty hole to our pockets. We went to use the pool to be told that pool is closed for maintenance. We went again the following day but water was very cold and it was dusty so did not feel like swimming in it. The jaquizi pressure of water bubbles was very low so we decided not to use it either.
