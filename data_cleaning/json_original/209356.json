Got directions off Google and they were wrong. Called hotel on cell phone, and was told that Sir, I need to know where you're coming from in a very rude manner. Most other front staff were pretty courteous. Checked in okay at 3 p.m. Got room, and remote control didn't work. Called down and they did bring one up that worked about 20 minutes later. Next, the tub while taking a shower filled with an inch or so of water. Next three mornings it didn't do that. The club sandwhich was not very good at $14. Ate half. It was a little cold by the time it got up to the room. Bar staff seemed okay except that it seemed to be pawned out or contracted out and not a part of Holiday Inn. The tall lamp by the chair didn't have a light bulb in it. I digress.

He really likes the service at the Holiday Inn Express hotels. That being said we choose this hotel for closness to the train going downtown so I could have the car. The front desk staff, with 2 exceptions, was horrible. Upon check in there were several people ahead of us and all were greeted with a curt \"No rooms available yet-comeback at 3(It was 1 PM). When it was our turn, we got the same line-dh just wanted to store our luggage and bikes so we could go over to the state fair.So the lady checks our reservation and realizes who dh is (like I said he travels extensively) and just about falls all over herself to apologize and all the sudden we can have our room right now. While it was nice for us,it's not nice for other travellers. We get to our floor and it's ghost town, confirming our suspicions that the front desk just didn't want tocheck anyone in early. The first night we went to the bar and the bartender informed us quite rudely that there was only one wine available as he didn't have the keys to the cooler. I felt as though we were interrupting him watching the game as we were the only people in there. They do have security that rides the lot 24/7 in a golf cart but the hotel backs up to an iffy area. I did ride through it to gain access to a bike trail and was OK, but not for the faint of heart or at night. We didn't receive maid service the second day until I went down at 3 and asked. Today was the icing on the cake. Dh asked for an extended check out as he's at a conference and won't be back until 2. He doesn't do this often but when he does if the hotel isn't busy (and believe me this one isn't) they're very graciousand allow it. The guy at the front desk this morning was very rude and arrogant and \"he could give us till 1 but that was absolutely it.\" We should've stayed downtown-next time we will. The rooms are outdated and the AC is iffy.

The front desk person we dealt with--I think her name is Melissa--was great. She never sleeps. She checked us in Monday night at 10pm. The next morning she gave us our free breakfast vouchers at 9:30am. She was helpful, friendly, and funny. The hotel restaurant, a sports bar and restaurant called Cassidy's, was surprisingly nice. We had dinner around 10:30pm after we checked in. I liked my burger; my colleagues liked their Mexican dishes. Skip the carrot cake, though. Breakfast was also good. A small buffet included fresh strawberries and pineapples. Yummy! You could get an omelet made to order at the buffet. The rooms were okay. Mine overlooked the hotel parking lot. My colleagues' overlooked a Ford dealership. We were not tempted by the small balconies because of the 110 degree heat. The a/c worked well, if a bit noisily. The water pressure and temperature were fine. The carpeted floor felt a bit dirty, but the pillows were the worst part of the room. They were lumpy. The beds were otherwise average. Parking was free. There is an indoor pool on the first floor. The room was steamy, but my colleagues said the water temperature was perfect. The elevators are aggressive, so be careful about sliding in there at the last second.

From the moment we called to confirm our reservation and group needs, we knew we were in for trouble. First, it was very difficult if not impossible to communicate with the front desk staff and some other departmental staff as their English was so poor. This is especially difficult over the phone. Our group had printed confirmations of non-smoking rooms in hand and were told we were all in smoking rooms! This led to finger pointing from the hotel to the travel agent and back again. After much haggling, our group was finally given the non-smoking rooms we absolutely needed due to health issues but claimed they could not put our group together on the same floor while similar groups were all given their non-smoking rooms blocked together. This made planning and communicating with our group during our stay very difficult. The sales staff was not accomodating or flexible to our group dinner needs and pricing. The rooms are in sad need of rennovation as are the hallways. The bathroom tile had mold in the grout. The adjustable shower head was wonderful, however. One of our rooms had a horrible sewer smell when we returned to it one day which seemed to be coming through a vent in the bathroom. We finally got a maid to spray something to help with the extreme odor as we were told there was no way they could move us as the hotel was full. (We saw people checking out daily). Some of our group had very saggy mattresses and lots of expressway noise as this facility is located right next to US 75 and very busy with Dallas traffic. The hotel ice machines were out of ice most of our stay or out of order (yes we went to each of the nine floors looking for ice!). There were mulitipe groups of athletes at our hotel and no accomodation to help them with ice to take out to their games or keep their beverages cold were made. The hotel claimed to have no refrigerators available and put people on waiting lists for one but we never received one during our stay which was essential due to medical issues. The three elevator doors closed very quickly with no rebound open system if someone stepped into the threshold. We saw a toddler almost get crushed when caught in the door. It was difficult for an adult to get the door to reopen! You had to call to get extra towels and once brought to you, if not used right away, the maid would take out any extra towels you ordered in the morning even when they were fresh and unused resulting in us having to call and call again. They gave three towels for a room occupied by four people. The front desk staff and gift shop would not make change for the toll road, their laundry, etc. We understood that the hotel would be booked with many youth groups during our stay, however, the hotel staff was never seen overseeing the hallways, elevators, pool, fitness room, etc where toddlers and very young children ran wild without adult supervision. To sum up, our group spent over $20,000 at this hotel on rooms and a group dinner. It was possibly the worst stay we have ever had with little interest from the management on our satisfaction and no customer service.
