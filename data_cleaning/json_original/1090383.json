{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wonderful memories My only negative experience with this hotel was finding it on my first night in Tokyo - To get there you have to walk through a maze of small and busy streets, full of people. I had nearly given up finding the place when I stumbled upon it.The hotel was very comfortable to stay in, the staff were extremely helpful (despite my lack of Japanese and not a lot of English being spoken by those who helped me!). I loved the quieter location, and the always interesting (and short, once I learnt the way!) walk to and from the train station. There were plenty of nice places to eat nearby, and convenience stores handy. And even a 24 hour jeans store just up the road!The room was reasonably small, but nothing different to most of the places I have stayed in in Europe. The bathroom was smaller still, but still very usable. One final thing - there is a restaurant under the hotel, and this restaurant featured in the movie Lost in Translation.", "Date": "Jul 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR355494394", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Blackbird_7"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066456-d1090383-r17480528-Shibuya_Creston_Hotel-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1090383", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
