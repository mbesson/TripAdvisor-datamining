{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap  Good points:-well located for Metro  10 mins walk to Centre-cheap  very clean-staff friendly when there-close to MarinaNot so good points:-noisy position on busy road  over noisy bar/restaurant. Ear plugs weren't enough for me.-poor entrance but that's unimportant-staff speak almost no English (why should they?!)-communicating with the hotel is difficult as often no one there. I emailed Sunday  didn't get a reply until Wednesday  was told no one was there.-on arrival I got a key for outside door  that was the last I saw of anyone (not a problem but just a pity  they run the restaurant downstairs so you can get hold of someone there)-reserved with VISA but wasn't told they'd insist on payment by cash. Went to the cashpoint to get cash  on return I was asked by someone else whether I wanted to pay by cash or VISA so mixed message there.-If you get a Marina view, it is in fact blocked by a large tree so when in leaf all you really see is the outside seating of the bar/restaurants on the street below.-no a/c so I imagine it's hot in the summer  too noisy to open windows.Would I stay again? If genuinely just staying in the room for sleep  not in the heart of summer then this is clean  cheap, leaving more money to spend on having fun. I'm personally not going to stay here again. Barcelona is noisy but there will be quieter still central locations where everything is just a bit more professional  I personally like to spend a few hours in the hotel to recuperate pre evening meal.Difficult to get email address so here it is: marinafolchbcn@hotmail.comIf you've already booked then have fun- the place is fine!", "Date": "May 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR721841300", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Wentthereandback"}, {"Content": "Great value, clean, good location       Bathroom2", "Date": "Mar 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR396210631", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "partan"}, {"Content": "Great find in Barcelona The Marina El Folch was recommended as a simple, clean, bargain place to stay in Barcelona - and it proved to be just that! We had 3 rooms between our party and they were all very clean, spacious enough and with en-suite bathrooms (with a bath) - our rooms also had balcomies which looked out over the marina (Port Vell) which was really good. The price (we paid \u9227?0 a night) did not include breakfast but as there is a supermarket about 2 minutes walk away, this was not a problem. The location is great (in Barcelonetta) and easily accessible to the sites - either by the tourist bus stops (would recommend) or by foot - the Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk along the marina so despite being a busy road, it is a nice area.The staff were also really friendly and nice, making us feel very welcome. They actually run the Restaurant Peru, and that is how you find reception - it is pretty much opposite the old museum. The beach is about 1.5km walk away and there are plenty of eating options nearby.Be prepared for a run down entrance to the rooms (accessed by a communal building) which does smell of damp - but when you enter the hotel area (through another door) it is immaculate and absolutely fine - just don't be put off by the first incorrect impression!I would definitely recommend asking for a front room with a balcony overlooking the main road and marina - but it has the usual issue regarding noise (although fine when the patio doors are shut) - so if you sleep very lightly, maybe a back room would be better.All in all, we had a great stay and would definitely go back there if we were to return to Barcelona.", "Date": "Feb 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR832968753", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RachSB"}, {"Content": "ottimo rapporto qualit\u813f/prezzo   showReview(13422080, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR193305785", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "pal2000"}, {"Content": "Billigunterkunft in Barcelonetta   showReview(7595565, 'full');", "Date": "May 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR684187255", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Supermaus"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d236203-r16138501-Marina_Folch-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "236203", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
