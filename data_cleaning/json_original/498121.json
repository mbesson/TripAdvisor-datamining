Bathroom equally tiny but clean and quite ok, no bath products apart from a tiny bar of soap. Minimal contains a bottle of water. View from room into a dismal backstreet. TV has hundreds of channels n virtually all Italian and the few English are scrambled. I don't want to sound too negative - the old receptionist was lovely (only person I saw in the hotel), but for that price I would have expected a little more - even in expensive Rome. Hotel 10 minutes from Fontana Di Trevi, Palo Barberini is next door, 15 minutes to Guard Vented, Villa Borghese and gardens, and 15 min from Stationed Termini Railway Station. All right in the heart of Rome. City tours start at Piazza Barberini 2 min from the hotel. Loads of restaurants, cafes, bars.

There is no sign for the hotel, just a big green door and a call box to its right that you have to access in order to be let in. We had no trouble finding the hotel. It's a great location. If you continue up the hill you can walk to Santa Maria Maggiore; across Barberini you find the Spanish Steps; around the corner from Barberini you go up to Galleria Borghese. Plus, you're near the metro if you don't want to walk all the way to St. Peter's. The street is called 4 Fountains because at the top of the hill there are, well, four pretty fountains. The room was a decent size for being a small hotel; the bathroom was great, a huge bathtub, excellent water pressure, and enough space to put your belongings. The bed was firm, as usual for European hotels, and there was a giant wardrobe and plenty of space to throw your bags and maps and things. Air-con worked great, which we needed during the evening. The breakfast was sad, but after eating such huge meals and gelato during the day, we didn't really care. The coffee was instant coffee. Rome is super-expensive for us Americans; plus you have to pay a tax in cash when you depart. In short, great little hotel. I'd come back. Pros- *great location. The street is quiet at night, and I wouldn't want to stay right near a tourist attraction for fear of freaks and noise. Some other Roman hotels are too close to fountains and piazzas, so you'd get lots of thru traffic. Here you're still close but a bit away from the hustle and bustle. *friendly owner *giant bathroom and great shower/bath, good water pressure *I felt very safe here; I'd recommend taking your passport and electronics with you.

Actually it is a little hotel, which stays inside a building together with Quebec's office. In contrary to other reviews this year, we found the hotel very easily. The great tip to arrive to the hotel is to ask for the \"Quattre Fontane\", which are 50 m down from its entrance. The service is very efficient, the rooms are cleaned every day, and there is no reason for fearing about allergies (my wife is very atopic and suffers with carpets) because everything is very suitable for every kind of people. There is a free Wi-fi internet available, which is very good for people taking computers on the travel. Only in the last day, we asked for a taxi to go to the airport, and a driver (called by the hotel psersonnel) had set 50 euros to do the service, but asked for 60 euros after arriving to the airport.
