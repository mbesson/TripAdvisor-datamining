There was no cover at the front door where we had to buzz in. The person on the buzzer said my card had been declined. I had to plead with her to be allowed to get in out of the rain so I could give her another card. I gave the same card and this time it went through. While we stood in the entry hall, a couple coming down the stairs said \"good luck!\". When we entered we saw what he meant. The window was leaking and there was a brownish puddle on the sill. running down the wall. There was some kind of stain on the bedroom curtains that looked like dried blood. The bed was a thin mat on what looked like a camp cot! We were only staying 1 night so we though we'd just watch tv and go to sleep. The tv only faced the kitchen sink and could not be seen from the sofa (which was filthy) Only a few stations available, half in Spanish. The walls looked like someone had been kicking then with black soled shoes. Needless to say we checked out that same hour. We were willing to face a biblical storm to find a new place rather than stay there!!!

Looks just like the photos. Very IKEA-ish decor. Everything very clean except the woodwork around doorknobs needed attention. Fully equipped kitchen. Comfortable bed, we asked for an extra blanket and got one right away. I would have been nice to have more towels though. Remember this is not a hotel! No one makes the bed, etc. Beautiful neighborhood, yards from the park, one block from subway, two blocks to Museum of Natural History. Couch folds out, my 20-something friend chose to sleep on the couch rather than fold it out, and was comfortable. Ottoman also folds out to single bed, but it didn't look comfortable. We opted to either put that cot mattress on the floor or have my 12 year old sleep with me in the queen bed. He ended up with me. Room was very quiet. Tall windows with no view , but they opened to get a nice breeze. Travelocity lost our reservation and even though I had a confirmed reservation, the number I called to check in (no one on-site, you get buzzed in) had no record of it. They were very apologetic and accommodating. I suggest calling the hotel number on your Travelocity reservation confirmation and re-confirm with the hotel staff! I would stay there again, especially if I was doing a lot of sightseeing/museums uptown. Other folks staying there were friendly. We stayed in 2R. Be prepared to wake up whenever the folks above you get up because the floors are hardwood. Luckily we all got up about the same time.

We were a family travelling with young children so thought that the apartment style was a great option. The fold out bed was BROKEN and although we called them (the service number NEVER answered until the reservation desk connected us so that line is being screened by the apartment manager- we left 5 answerphone messages over 4 days and NEVER got a reply from them), The bed was never fixed so the children slept on a mattress on the floor. They didn't provide enough towels, pillows and linen when we arrived (although our reservation clearly stated the number of people) and after ringing they turned up minus the pillows. The person dropping them off just said someone could bring them tomorrow, so the kids shared a pillow on the first night. The final straw was on the second night when the poilce came and broke up a party on the 4th floor- of at least 75 people, who had been filing past our door on a noisy and narrow stairwell (no elevators). They had also been outside our window on the street and their conversations were lewd and offensive. I can accept that that it was a bit of bad luck for us and these things happen except that any contact I have made to them has now gone unanswered AND you prepay, so when we were ready to leave after night number 2 we would have lost our money. At that time the only advice the reservation desk could give us was to contact them after our stay- which we have done, but as I have said they have our money so why bother communicating with us.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malm\u00c3\u00b6", "Title": "\u201cYour own vacation apartment in New York at a fair price\u201d", "Author": "MalmoFamily", "ReviewID": "UR32019848", "Content": "Having stayed in apartment 4F for a week we now conclude that the guy saying this was an unsafe place should go back to his retirement home in the country. We are a family of four with two small children who spent the time in New York walking around, sight seeing, museum watching etc. New York is a special place on earth, especially for us coming from a mid size Swedish town but we had a wonderful time here. We didn't regret staying on upper west side near the park and we certainly didn't regret staying in Central Park House. Beside of the lack of an elevator the place is perfect - and the lack of an elevator just gave us a chance to get more exercise than the jogging in the park and the walking around ;-) so we have very little bad things to say about the place. No it is not a hotel, there is no front desk, there are no guys holding the door for you, you don't have your own armed ex-cops patrolling the hall ways, the maid doesn't come around every day and make your bed - but if you just put your towels out they return in the afternoon clean. We stayed more than five days, and therefore had one complimentary cleaning that was arranged over the phone - using the phone in the apartment and the free phone number posted in capital letters on the inside of the door - and here we had the one miss. They misplaced our 'order' but on the return call we were promised that it would be done the next day, which it was - hotel standard cleaning. The apartment is spacious and the kitchenette is adequate for a holiday apartment. The furniture and layout is fine for four persons in a family. The air condition can be turned off and the windows open. What more can you demand from a low-mid price (compared to other hotel/apartments in New York) apartment?", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Value": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, VA", "Title": "\u201c[--] Awesome!\u201d", "Author": "TheSherms", "ReviewID": "UR24077305", "Content": "We had a great time, It is in a great location is very clean and modern, and we felt very safe.
