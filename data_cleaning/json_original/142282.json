However, my experience was not like many that I read. The hotel must have been recently remodeled, as our room was clean and had a contemporary decor. Sure there were signs of a fifty-year old hotel visible, but the overall experience and value made the stay worthwhile. The staff was super, especially our desk clerk Jennifer, and the pool area was nicely landscaped and maintained. The Lexington Hotel should be judged based upon what it is: an older hotel complex off the highway, not a luxury resort.

The rooms are rather tired, though kept clean throughout, bed comfortable, a good shower though smaller than others we have been in, a single cup coffee maker with 2 coffee bags provided, and an old TV which often didn't work due to the signal failing, There were plenty of drawers, a desk and hanging space. The front door leads off an external passageway and when closed firmly could be felt around the building. The 'aircon' was efficient and could be controlled easily but was quite noisy. We were unfortunate to spend 6 nights when students were holidaying and partying in the rooms around. The last night was noisy all night and the management failed to deal with any complaints. However we were disturbed by rowdy behaviour at some stage during all the nights we were there, including a rather unpleasant domestic row between a couple of guests. The surrounding area suffers from heavy traffic being in the place that it is located. The swimming pool is good though the rules were broken by lots of swimmers, notably by smoking. Parking is free with some under cover spaces. Our hire car was damaged overnight whilst parked by the block. There is a restaurant on site which closed at 10pm and refused to serve coffee to us after a meal at 9.30pm. The food was fairly good but wine was sold by the glass only, for $7.

The pool has a tiki bar with LCD TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which closes too early and the traffic noise from US 1 is tolerable. Georgia is the bartender and a very nice lady. Pool is open until 11. The rooms have kind of been updated, they are trying to make it a step above a Days Inn. The rooms do look nice, but if you look closely you will notice a few little areas where they went cheap. The toilet tank was from a different kind of toilet and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit properly, the sink must have lost a leg holding it up because they had a permanent make shift thing holding it up. Beds are pretty lame, but for 1 or 2 nights doable. I had a room overlooking the pool with 2 queens. Fridge and microwave are nice to have. No phone by the bed which was kind of a pain. The attached restaurant Kahoots is actually pretty good and the best thing about staying here was the room service was very affordable, I ordered breakfast which was less than $12 for one person, great price for room service. If you plan on doing the Duval thing then this is not your hotel as the taxi will cost you about $40-$50 roundtrip, I am assuming you are not going to drink and drive. You would be better off spending the taxi money on a nicer place within walking distance to Duval and Old Town. If you are driving yourself , you are probably still going to have to pay $10 for parking near Duval. This is the furthest hotel from Duval. Overall the hotel is nice, it is not a Hilton, however it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not priced as such. Not sure if I would stay there again as being close to Duval is what I would prefer.

When we finally got our room it was like stepping into a scene from The Shining, I'm sure the decor has not been touched since 1969! the carpet was rank, the bathroom was mouldy, the bed was actually quite comfortable but don't look underneath! also, the pool was like a cappuccino it had so much scum on top... Each time we were in reception we heard people complaining... Needless to say we checked out and moved to a B&B off Duval. Im gutted that we spent $300ish there..

We booked this hotel for five days and each was an adventure. Although we had asked for an early check in, when we arrived, we were told that no rooms were available. Consequently we checked our bags and toured the island. When we later came back to check in, it turned awful. We asked to get our bags and they just handed us without asking to see the stub of the tags they had put on them when we left them. They just handed us bags including one that was not ours! When we got to our room, it was not what we had requested. We had asked for a second floor room with a view of the pool. Instead, we had a ground floor room with a head on view of the exterior wall of the building. When we contacted the front desk and asked for another room, we were refused. This place was unbelievable. The people at the front desk (especially the women) were rude and offensive. It was as if we were a bother to them. Our room had a musty odor. We complained about it and three days later they sprayed something that was to mask it, but then we had that smell to contend with. Water in the ice bucket was not emptied most days and on one day our used glasses were not replaced. Behind the nightstand was an uncovered electrical outlet. Rooms were noisy, in part, from the trucks on the main highway running in front of the hotel. The carpet was dirty and worn. The pool, however, was very nice, but that hardly made up for all the other shortcomings.
