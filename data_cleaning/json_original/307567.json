{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great relaxing break This is now the third time we have stayed at this hotel over the past 10 years (including getting married in the grounds in 2001).The hotel is one of the larger resort types in the area and is absolute beachfront. There are many rooms, howeve they all surround a lovely lush, garden setting.The pool is nice - nothing mind-blowing, but pleasant with a waterfall and a hot  cold spa.The rooms are comfortable and clean. The bathrooms are small but functional and there is complimentary water provided each day. There is a plenty of channels on the T.V.Breakfast was included in our stay and I must say that there was choice galore! Every cuisine was catered for - noodles for Asian travellers, meats and cheeses for Europeans and big jar of Vegemite for us Australians.You can easily reach the Discovery Mall shopping Plaza via a 5-10 minute walk along the beach or you can go out the front and experience the traffic on the street. A walk into Kuta intself is about 20 minutes.The staff are genuinely friendly - i.e it's not forced. Their smiles are natural.The prices at the resturant, bar and spa are excessive by Bali standards and we only ate once at the restuarant as it was included in our room stay. The food was pretty ordinary compared with breakfast fare. There are so many restuarants within a stone's throw that I wouldn't bother eating at the hotel.All in all - great stay. The pool wasn't crowded and plently of sun-lounges to go about. The hotel has many amenities, but we didn't utilise much apart from the pool. The hotel is quiet considering the amount of rooms and it is clean, relaxing and pretty good value.", "Date": "Nov 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR288569876", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Leighbee27"}, {"Content": "A Good Choice       Hotel Gardens", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR255206964", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Merry_8"}, {"Content": "Loved the Ramada Bintang!

From our quick observation; Ramada is a large resort with about 400 rooms spread over 4 stories. Our room on the 3rd floor, is quite spacious and has a small balcony overlooking the gardens and the pool beyond. The verandah and the room itself, is a bit dated and could do with a new coat of paint. The room was reasonably furnished. Our king-size bed was quite firm and extremely comfortable \u9225?just what we needed for a good night sleep. The Ramada is sited in an expansive garden which is very neatly kept. The swimming pool is quite large and well located, facing the beach. The beach itself was quite dirty and the sea quite rough then, probably due to the monsoon season. Regardless, my partner and I had a lovely time sitting at the bar and enjoying our long chat, with the sea breezes blowing in our face. Location-wise, the Ramada is quite ideal, just a 10-15 mins walk to Kuta Square and Centro-Kartika shopping centre. The quality in the Restaurant was below par as the curry fish that we had for dinner was so tough and dry. The breakfast buffet was quite extensive but the quality was also quite poor and we were disappointed that there weren\u9225\u6a9b more Balinese fare. Overall, I think the Ramada is over-priced and you could find smaller hotels further away from town with better value for money.

It was a return visit which is very rare for us as we like to try different areas and hotels in Bali but we loved Ramada so much we had to return. I had asked for a particular room and when we arrived we were given the exact room we had asked for, which for Bali hotels is amazing. Ramada is a very big hotel but you are not aware of the size due to the lay out. We always walk through the garden to get to our room so it never feels like a four storey building. I have stayed at the smaller boutique hotels but I am not that keen on the smallness of them and having to be everyones best friend. The facilites at this hotel are very good, the beachfront spa is one of the best in Bali (but expensive ), the pool is on the beach front, the decor in the rooms is excellent and the wharf on the beach as perfect place to see the sunset. The staff are wonderful and nothing is to much trouble. The prices within the hotel ( except the spa ) are very reasonable. We book our driver direct at the hotel and it is not expensive. I like the Tuban area as it is 5 minutes from the airport, plenty of spas around it, good restaurants,( try Ma Jolly next door to left along beach, divine.) You can walk to Discovery or Matahai ( or $1 taxi ) or you can stroll along the beach to main Kuta beach or you can just chill by the pool with cocktail.Ramada has faults but tell me a hotel that doesnt. You can hear footsteps from room above but if that bothers you book into the 4th floor which are all non smoking rooms. The bathrooms are not huge but there is a very big bath. They do have coffee and tea making facilites and a bar fridge with ice.

While only there for a short period, I was hugely impressed by the standard of the hotel. Firstly, the staff were absolutely amazing, especially a young lady at the Reception desk. Not only did she remember the names of my friend and I, book our tours, but she was just so friendly. All the staff were prepared to go that extra mile to accommodate our needs.I shared a superior twin room with a friend, and the room was always clean. Certainly, the room had general wear and tear ie: scuffs on the floor, but that can only be expected. The resort itself was immaculate, and the gardens well kept. Perhaps one of the features I loved the most was the heated and cooled pools that sat above the enormous swimming pool and waterfall. The resort itself is about 15-20mins walk to Central Kuta, and about 10 to the Discovery Plaza. You can either walk along the street or the beach. It is a beachfront Resort, however the surf wasn't particularly good, but it is a short walk to better waves.For the most part, the food at the Resort was quite good. However, after a hard day shopping my friend and I ordered roomservice only to severely disappointed with the supermarket-frozen-food-isle standard of food that arrived. We also had problems trying to place an international call out of the Hotel using a phone card - I don't believe the operators understood. We had a problem with the airconditioner, but I am certain that if we had phoned reception, it would have been repaired immediatly.The Ramada Bintang Bali is a huge, but very quiet resort. By 7pm, not a soul was to be seen in the grounds. This is a disadvantage to those my age looking for a lively time - but it would be very good for families and couples.Overall - It is a fantastic resort, and I highly recommend it (even just for the cooled and heated pools!).for more photos email bastet_girl@hotmail.com", "Date": "Oct 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR866051793", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Selina_Kyle"}, {"Content": "A pretty good hotel, but not 4 star We stayed 2 weeks in June this year  found the hotel to be quite nice.
