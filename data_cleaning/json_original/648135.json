{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bad management, renovation needed We booked for our holidays Villa putri directly from the agent indovillas, an agency renting some of the most luxurious villas in Bali and the services offered for Villa Putri on the internet looked very attractive . The view from the villa was nice, and we enjoyed not being in a hotel and having a private pool but we faced many annoyances during upon arrival and during the stay.- None of the bedroom had dark curtains or shutters to provide a black out- The first night there was no quilt as they still were in the laundry, the second night we had the quilts but they all were filled with polyester - Many electrical plugs unsafe and /or defective- not enough hot water for 4 showers- The baby sitter is somebody who just follows kids ( doesn't play or even talk to them)- The laundry service was lamentable ( clothes returned with stains and not ironed)- the supply of soap and shampoo was deplorable( the shampoo was a sticky green paste )- The bathroom towels had stains- The bathroom basin were blocked , I used the suction grip to drain them- Some tiles of the swimming pool were broken ( my kids hurt themselves)- The cook is just ok- The driver was excellentThe villa needs serious renovation and adequate maintenance and a quality of services which reflects the ones offered by the agency. Indovillas clearly acts only as booking agent and marketing agent and takes no interest in the upkeep of the property and the quality of the service. Indovilla's manager (who came to the villa after we complained) had never met the housekeeper of the villa, who had worked there for eight years.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR360774666", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Beaciel"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d648135-r19146190-Putri_Bali_Villa-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "648135", "Price": "$395"}}
