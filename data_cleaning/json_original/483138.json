This is a great travellers hotel.The rooms are large and the showers are small but i always have found both to be clean.Yes there there are brothels nearby but all you see are buildings with a doorway. Unlike Amsterdam and Hamburg you dont see the wares.There is also a bar accross the road where people drink on the street but i have never had a problem in the area.The only people who go to the brothels are locals and there are no problems in the streets and no loud noise to consider.There is no view to speak of but there arent many hotels that do and you are not there to sit in your room and look out of the window.There is no AC but there are good fans in the rooms.Breakfast is included and a typical german meal. There is yoghurt, fresh fruit, many types of bread, cheese smallgoods, eggs, spreads and condiments, juices, tea coffee etc.The dining area has been expanded to fit in more tables.Close by are small supermarkets and internet cafes.The Konstablewache (train station) is close by and trains to the airport stop here. Again there is plenty of shops etc there.It is close to Zeil (shopping area) which is above the Konstablewache which is a 5 min walk if you dawdle.I have stayed here a number of times and if you want the service of a five star place then book a five star place. I simply check in say hello every time i drop off my key or pick it up but i am not there to converse with the staff and once you have breakfast i am away from there until i want to crash. I havent had the problems others have had and would stay there again when i am in frankfurt.I booked through octopus travel and it is about the same rate when i booked", "Date": "Sep 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR291581539", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Nibzee"}, {"Content": "Bed bugs - Avoid at all cost On first glance this hotel seemed like a bargain but on our first night we were asleep for about 2 hours when my friend woke up complaining about being bitten by 'something'.

Room was ok (cheap look), but you can see some dust on the furniture/carpet and bathroom was so small that was hardly to move inside. It seems that cleaning is not the most popular job for staff. There were also some problem with breakfest (nice bufet, lots of things but you have to get up early). We were missing some bread so I asked receptionist/waitress if she could bring more and she just go to the another guest and asked him Do you mind if I take your bread, because we don\u9e93t have more which was quite funny but not polite and professional.

The hotel is new, that is, it was established only recently in August 2004. The building was built in the late 1960's. The reception desk is small, and there is a lift to the upper floors.The double rooms look like they were previously self-contained flatlets, which means that they're actually quite large (over 20 square metres) with large windows (very efficient sound proofing and outside blinds which are typical of German houses). They have a small hallway with a wardrobe, hooks for the coats and a large mirror. The bathroom is a bit on the small side with a shower cabin, hair dryer and a few toiletries (soap, shampoo, shower gel). Everything looks very new. The actual room is large and would satisfy a four-star standard (clean, bright, with a small fridge, desk, chair, armchair, chest of drawers, TV). The furnishings are made of dark wood, while the walls are painted in magnolia. The central heating was working very well, windows can be opened wide - in case it is too hot. As this hotel does not have a catering business, the breakfast is a bit on the modest side. In the breakfast area downstairs, there are four tables each with four chairs, which means that at peak times you might have to share a table with other guests. The buffet is very small - only two or three people can help themselves at any one time. The food is fine - crispy rolls, toast, jam, honey, cheese, ham or salami, cereals, juices, fruit, yoghurt, fresh coffee or tea. By and large, they offer all the foods you would expect from a breakfast buffet in a three-star hotel. It's only that the breakfast room is indeed very small and doesn't invite guests to stay and to read a newspaper after breakfast etc. The location of the hotel is not particularly attractive (mainly Turkish shops and bars) but safe for travellers and not too noisy. On the positive side, it's only a five-minute walk to the famous Zeil shopping street and about 10 - 15 minutes walk to Sachsenhausen, where Frankfurt's night life is at its best. Public transport (station Konstablerwache) is about 3 minutes on foot. Altogether I would recommend this hotel to travellers who desire a nice, spacious and comfortable room and who do not put too much emphasis on the breakfast. I booked via -------------- and paid 50 Euro per night for a double room. During trade fair times, of course, prices will be considerably higher.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR288591424", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Thorpe123"}, {"Content": "calidad-precio excelente.
