I love this little boutique hotel. The staff are very kind and humble and look forward to sharing their village of Keliki with all the guests.They offer a village walk at no extra cost to all their guest and it is a wonderful way to start your time in Bali. Dewa, a hotel employee, escorted me on both the village walks that I did. Most of the staff come from Keliki. The owners of the hotel are from New Zealand and live in Jakarta. You can tell that they keep a close eye on running the hotel as the staff are very well trained and accommodating. There can be some communication problems but the front office managers (Niko and Nyoman) are happy to help out if you need assistance.The rooms are clean and full of local furniture and art. Most of the rooms are in bungalows surrounding a beautiful pool. They also have a villa which has 3 bedrooms, perfect for a family or group. The villa is HUGE with a big open air living and dining room. The view is to die for...lots of greenery and a river valley across in the distance.The meals are suprisingly good at the hotel, considering that they are kind of out of the way. I think they mostly cater to hotel guests as opposed to people stopping in for a meal. The hotel is about a 15 minute drive to Ubud and the staff are happy to take you in when you want. They also have internet service. You can store your valuables in individually locked storage boxes in the office. I usually have most of my sightseeing/day trips pre-booked but if you don't , the staff are more than happy to make those arrangements.If you don't mind being outside of Ubud this is a perfect choice. Sometimes I find the energy level in Ubud to be abit much so this is a perfect hideaway. FYI, I am a travel agent who specializes in arranging and escorting girls trips to Bali. I've been to Bali 15 times and really love Ubud. I''ve stayed at lots of hotel in the area and the Alam Sari is one of my favorites. There are more expensive boutique hotels but for what they offer, it's a great deal and very Balinese. Enjoy!", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR233025935", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Calgary_Bali_Babe"}, {"Content": "Alam Sari Keliki Memorable We spent five nights at the Alam Sari Keliki. Three of us rented the villa and got a discounted price for the five night stay and the fact that we were only using two bedrooms. It was well worth it, as the villa is expansive, and we could have our continental breakfast (or dinner) right there with a view of the rice fields and briefly Gunung Agung in the distance. We had stayed at the Pertiwi some years ago, and undoubtedly it is still nice but its setting has been swallowed by the expansion of Ubud. We wanted to stay in a less urban setting. Alam Sari captures some of the feeling of Ubud from 15 years ago. An earlier comment describes it as rustic, but that's a bit unfair. It is not a five-star big name resort but it has its charm, a very Balinese feeling, and a wonderful staff plus good food.It is about 20 minutes from Ubud, but we found organizing our trips around the shuttle very easy. We would take the free shuttle in and eat dinner in Ubud, and the restaurant would call to have them pick us up. The trip back was 35000 rps. We also booked a tour with the hotel to Goa Gajah, Gunung Kawai, Yeh Pulu, and Tampaksiring. We were a bit nervous at the trip there about how far it was from things, but found it to be one of the advantages. On our first full day we got to see an entire cremation ceremony in the next village with Dewa, the hotel's best guide. This was a remarkable experience for us. We also did a walking tour of the Keliki village with Putu who took us to his home as well. We spent a couple of hours at the home of one of the artists who does the miniature paintings. On our departure Putu gave us a couple of his own paintings as a parting gift. One thing they should tell visitors is that from the road there is a stairway climb both to the rooms and even more up to the villa. We had invited a friend and fortunately she did not come as she would have had trouble with the stairs. However, the fact that you are above the road also diminishes the road noise.We also had a nice massage in the small but attractive spa. It was most relaxing vacation, and the stay at Alam Sari was memorable due to the staff and experience of the local culture.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR856180267", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Elijah"}, {"Content": "Alam Sari  The Alam Sari is one of the hotels I staid at during my Sept. 2004 visit to Bali. It is located north of Ubud near the small village of Keliki. The location is out of the way, but the scenery is nice. Walking into Ubud is not practical  it would take over an hour. Walking back to Alam Sari from Ubud would be even worst, as it would be mostly uphill. The rooms are a bit rustic with open-air bathrooms. The restaurant is excellent. The staff is friendly  helpful.Traveling in Bali can present a lot of hassles. This is in the form of tourist related personnel that will try to make money at your expense. The tactics can be very bold, rude, relentless  annoying. A lot of it is down right deception  cheating. I ran into this all over Bali. Even the hotel arranged drivers (these are non-hotel personnel) cannot be trusted. I had a particularly bad experience traveling to my next hotel via such a hotel-arranged driver. This guy took me on several detours to try to get me to purchase goods from his art store or from stores owned by his contacts, (which means you pay double the price due to his commission). Later he asked if it was ok for his sister in law to join the trip so she can takeover the driving. I agreed. Further down the road we stopped and a large muscular man quickly gets into the car as the driver. I was afraid this was going to be trouble. After we finally arrived at my destination they tried to charge me an additional fare, which I refused. The best temples were Pura Basakih for its grandeur (largest in Bali)  Pura Luhur Ulu Watu for its beautiful setting (on a cliff overlooking the ocean). Neither Tanah Lot nor Pura Ulun Danu Bratan were worth it. Overall Bali is over rated. It\u9225\u6a9a more paradise lost than paradise. Believe it or not some of the worst traffic jams I\u9225\u6a9de ever seen is on Bali at around the airport during rush hour. If I go again I would stay away from the tourist areas such as Denspasar, Kuta, Ubud, Sanur  Candidasa. Spend more time in out of the way areas such as Amed (great snorkeling right off the beach) where there is still some paradise. Try to stay away from tourist industry people as much as possible.
