So, let\u2019s start our story. My sister and I arrived to the Veio Park Hotel on 5th , September. It looked very nice from the road because it is located a bit deep in the private little park (not on the busy road \u2013 it is important who likes to sleep in the peace). There is a lot of safety place for car parking in front of the building and at the same time there are a lot of green trees there to make a pleasant shade. The building itself looks very nice and well-conditioned. In the room there are all necessary conveniences including a safe ( it\u2019s important for my story). We left our luggage in the room, placed documents and money into the safe and ran to Rome. Here I\u2019d like to notice that the way to Rome is not so difficult as I had read in tourist sites while I was preparing my trip. 5-10 minutes by bus (201,223 and one more)to La Giustiniana station, then 20 minutes by train to the station Roma St.Peter using the same ticket for 1 Euro. We walked around Rome all day. It was wonderful. In the evening we returned to the hotel, asked in the restaurant a teapot with hot water, drank in the room our \u201cRussian tea\u201d and went to sleep. I even couldn\u2019t imagine what the next morning may hold! Next morning we went to have breakfast and I opened the safe to take my money to pay for the hotel. Breakfast and payment took about 20 minutes (breakfast is rather rich and various for Italy). We were hurry because in three hours we should be in the port Chivitavecccia to check in for Mediterranean Cruise. Coming back to the room we started to pack our things and at one moment I\u2019d like to pack my passport and couldn\u2019t find it. At first I wasn\u2019t very nervous thinking that it fell down somewhere but in some minutes I couldn\u2019t find all my money!!!!!At this moment I remembered that before paying for the hotel I took my passport and money from the safe, put money into the passport and went out from the room. We were hurry and I couldn\u2019t remember if I put them into the safe again! At this moment I noticed that the window was opened (we opened it in the morning ourselves and didn\u2019t close it going to have breakfast). Terrible thoughts immediately came to my mind \u2013 STOLEN! Panic and horror seized me \u2013 in the foreign country without passport, without visa, without money, without Italian language. What is more that made me fully frustrated - my Cruise that I had been preparing for six months might go kaput\uf04c(( Of course, first of all I rummaged all my and sister\u2019s luggage, I looked under the beds and into the dustbin but nothing\u2026.My sister was running around me and screaming \u201ccall the Police, call the Police\u2026\u201d I went to the reception and told them about my awful problem. It was so fortunate that Chief Manager Alberto turned out a patience and clever man. He asked me several questions about our morning. In spite of the fact that I was very nervous I noticed that he was very surprised with the event. I was able to recognize that it is the first incident of such kind in this hotel. But I didn\u2019t have any explanation for the mystery \u2013 my passport and money disappeared. We returned with Alberto to the room and again checked up all the bags in it. At the same time my sister ran around the hotel and watched all the dustbins looked under the benches hoping that thief took money but threw out my passport (it is usual practice in Russia because they needn\u2019t to have evidences). I wanted nothing besides my passport! The time melted away and with each minutes we were far and far from our Cruise. My sister got tired to run around the hotel and came back to the room. In her hand there was only little lady handbag. I was sure that she checked up it several times. Only wise and insistent Alberto guessed to make her open it. She resentfully opened it and with words \u201cthere are only MY docume\u2026.\u201d pulled out the transparent envelope with\u2026.my passport\u2026..Her passport was in the absolutely even envelope in her bag,too. I didn\u2019t kill my sister and didn\u2019t kiss to the death Alberto only because we were extremely pressed for time and had to run to the train. Only 20-30 minutes more and our dreams about Cruise might be broken down at all! We looked really crazy from our happiness that moment. Certainly I apologized to the staff and now I want to do it again because I suspected of them. My \u201cbad girl\u201d sister also feels guilty towards them and asks excuse. As she explains at first she took her passport from the safe and then she decided to check the safe up, saw \u201cher\u201d passport again ant took it,too. Money was inside and she couldn\u2019t see them\u2026Thanks God, it was found the man who had precise mind at that moment\u2013 Alberto. Seriously speaking I fully recommend this hotel, especially who travels by car and wants to have good conveniences for the reasonable price. Those who use public transport should be ready to spend about 30-40 minutes to take Vatican but to save 50 Euros (minimum) per day. I live in Saint Petersburg and every day spend one hour to get my job and one hour to come back home, so 30 minutes couldn\u2019t frighten me:))", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cannes", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel in Italy ?

As such, given the nice things said about this Hotel i decided to risk staying outside Rome. Reviews were fairly accurate and it was a lovely hotel and the staff were fine and as hit and miss as any UK hotel - some were smiley, some were less, but everyone was helpful! The breakfast looks weak, but is actually rather filling, but i do suggest a wider spread of fruits in the morning.The bed in my room (102) was absol;utely amazing - very firm and I felt great in the morning. My main comments are not so much with the hotel, but its location. The reviews on ehre about the trains are misleading. Firstly the shuttle, which is a car and a member of staff coming out to give you a ride, which feltl it's a favour ratehr than service, and only runs between 8-10am and then 6-8 in the evening. However, I enjoyed the walk to the station - 10-15minutes. The train takes 35 minutes to Roma St Pauls, and I timed it, which is 5 minute walk to the Vatican. However, if you want to get around the city, then the metro from Roma Termini is better or if you are prepared to research, you can try get off earlier and catch the metro from another station; this becomes annoying.... The last train is about 9.30, but again this depends where you get on. We didn't try it, but apaprently tehre was a 10.30 train, however there was also a strike the day we wanted to stay late and so we didn't want to risk it as the trains were hit and miss after 5.30 - normal service did not resume! Overall, it was a massive inconvenience, more so than reviews had you believe, but for a 2 Euro round trip per day (I spent 10 altogether), it may seem worth it to some than paying more extortionate prices in the centre. The problem is that you lose out onseeing the city at night unless you ar eprepared to pay for a taxi, or are staying in winter when it gets darker a little earlier. Yes, there is not a lot around the hotel. A few bars, and a nice restaurant called La giustiniana near the station.It was cheap and cheerful and i thought the food was lovely. The hotel restaurant would definitley be something to avoid - over-priced, for convenience i assume, and really poor quantity to price ratio. It wasn't that nice, too! They need to work on this, but the staff were lovely. Overall, the hotel caters more for business trips rather than leisure, but if they made a few simple changes, such as a decent shuttle service to Rome, four a day 2 morning trips and 2 return trips, i think then there would be no reason to not consider this as a future option if we came back. Until then, I will seek elsewhere in rome when i return in March to for the rugby. Finally, if anything spoilt the trip it was the tourists and little to do with the hotel, they were unbearable and I can understand why Italians have such a rude attitude, tourists are just rude, too, although some Italians in the city centre were just blatantly hostile forgetting that people are on holidays! p.s. I had an Italian / Brazilian partner so she spoke the lingo, which is helpful, so perhaps I received a bit more friendliness through association! :)", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Racine, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, with excellent staff\u201d", "Author": "stayatthisplace", "ReviewID": "UR115770124", "Content": "Location was not the greatest with regards to restaurants and other off site amenities, however, staff is excellent.

At the time we were knew thus and were willing to accept this, but in hindsight we would definitely not stay this far out again, mainly because it does nit feel like you are staying in Rome, but rather some distant characterless suburb. I feel the traffic in Rome is just similar to that if any other large city and even my 70 year old father drove into the city and easily found parking and a great hotel in the Porta Pia area which had a great atmosphere. Finally we were tired one night and as there is not any other restaurant within about 800 metres if the Veio Park we decided to eat at the hotel. It was 8.30 at night and we were the only ones in the restaurant which feels like a large hospital cafeteria. The restaurant manager was the same man who drives he shuttle (car we had to call 3 times from the station and took 40 minutes to pick us up). It won the prize for the worst meal we had in Italy which I guess us why the restaurant was empty. They also only had 1 waitress for about 30 tables, so I suspect they don't expect many customers.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLOOK NO FURTHER - Numero uno a Roma.\u201d", "Author": "michael_snezana", "ReviewID": "UR115221580", "Content": "As it was our first time in Italy we were a little nervous about finding a suitable hotel for what we needed.

I typically never eat at a hotel's restaurant, however since the staff were so friendly, I figured I would support the place. The atmosphere was poor, we were given bread from the morning, the salad was not good by any means however my pasta was good. I would not recommend the restaurant unless they take more care. I think you can do much better anywhere else actually. It was the only somewhat unpleasant dining experience I had while in Rome and the only real negative about the hotel.

When I booked the hotel i didn\u2019t look and see where there hotel actually was in comparison to the centre of Rome, so when i found out that it was a little far out of the way i was apprehensive. BUT i can say that even being a lazy fall out of bed into the colosseum kind of person, where the hotel was couldn\u2019t have affected me less :). It was so easy to get into the centre of Rome and the sights. There was bus stops going both ways straight outside the hotel and there is a free bus shuttle service between the hotel and the local train station somewhere between 8 and 10 in the morning i think and from 6 to 8 at night (times might not be 100% accurate, i can\u2019t remember). The hotel offers the smallest of the three bus tickets for \u20ac1 which means you can safely get into Rome without worry on your first day. (you have to stamp the ticket in a yellowy/orange box when you get to the station and then you have 75 minutes from then, it only allows one metro (underground) journey). What we then opted for when we got into town was a 3 day tourist ticket it basically gave us unlimited travel on buses, metro and trains. There is also a night bus (N25) from the centre of Rome which means you can still get back to the hotel without the crazy prices of taxis(we didn\u2019t even need one) The hotel itself was very clean and comfortable; the staff were very helpful and most spoke good English. The room was cleaned everyday of our stay, changing towels and a general clean-up. The showers were powerful and clean. Surprisingly the minibar was very affordable as well. There are safes in the rooms (which you set the code for) and also air conditioning, which in April was helpful I\u2019m assuming the weather is much hotter in the summer months. We didn\u2019t have dinner here but there is a restaurant open from 7:30pm to 10:30pm i think this hotel is definitely worth the travel into town, I read reviews on here before i went saying how far away it was etc but i seriously believe that it isn\u2019t an issue. Say you have a travel party of two and you\u2019re going for three nights. The money that you save (minus the 22\u20ac for 2 bus tickets) staying at this hotel is extremely worth it. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel apart from i personally didn\u2019t like the breakfast but there was a wide selection of cereals, cold meats, cheese, yogurts, bread and cakes, which my partner woke up especially for. I\u2019m just fussy with food. there is a local takeaway type pizza place with real Italian pizzas for very decent prices just down the road (turn right out of the hotel) also next to that there is a bar type small shop kind of thing, it sells cigarettes cakes crisps drinks etc. which was convenient and a small supermarket next to that.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel with good services\u201d", "Author": "magnata602", "ReviewID": "UR103553284", "Content": "This hotel is very good.

I think the last train on weekdays was at 10:30 or 11pm, so we feel a bit rushed after dinner in the city to make sure we catch the last train back since dinner in Rome often starts at 8pm and it's not a quick affair. We also had to take a cab to the airport since our flight was early AM, too early for train operation. The taxi was supposed to be a flat rate from the hotel, E$50, but the cab driver on pulling into FCO airport told us they never agreed to any rate and it was E$55. We couldn't argue since we don't speak Italian and didn't understand the conversation that transpired between conciege and driver. HOTEL SERVICE We were charged for an extra drink and the manager on check out did not take it off. It was for 1 beer which was drank by whoever stayed there before us.

We arrived at 7 PM after spending whole day in the center of Rome. Lady at the reception welcomed us with a smile. Frankly speaking every day of our stay service was very nice and helpful. Room we got, was not very big but comfortable and quiet during nights if there are not guests who do parties in the near rooms. The things we were lack of in the room was free water bottles and things to prepare a tea or coffee (2 Euros for a tea in the hotel bar!). Bathrooms are very clean, they can satisfy the greatest aesthete. Hotel is located quite far from a center but don`t worry. With a good planning a journey from the center to hotel takes about 45 min and costs 1 Euro/person! The best is to take metro to Valle Aurelia, next train FR3 to La Giustiniana and next bus 322 or 201 to hotel (not sure the numbers). Don`t travel by bus because you will be stopping on countless stops. The advantage is the hotel provides free shuttle to La Guistiniana. As for breakfasts they are tasty and big enough to provide a supply of energy for visiting Rome. But they are the same every day. Lack of hot meals like sausages, eggs etc. Lack of coffee, tea pots. Every hot drink you have to order. Is not a problem when there are few guests but with more it can become. I don't know much about surroundings. Man from the hotel told us about good restaurant near but we didn't check it because we spent whole day in the center. I didn't notice any shops near either.

We visited from Dec. 26, 2009, to Jan. 2, 2010. The hotel is situated in a suburban area northwest of Rome with lots of open countryside. We felt quite safe walking in the neighborhood (other than the normal danger of recklessly enthusiastic Italian drivers). There are restaurants, pizzerias (2 with delivery), a supermarket, and an electronics store nearby. The latter proved a good place to buy an adaptor (10 euros) for using our US electrical devises. This is a critical piece of equipment for American travelers in Europe. They can handle the 220 voltage, but our straight-pronged plugs won't fit into round-pronged outlets in Europe. By walking or catching the bus just outside the hotel, we could catch a train about half a mile away that will take us into Rome and connect us with the metro for an economical 1 euro per 75-minute trip. The cost of the train to the Fiumicino Airport, a little over an hour away, is only 5.50 euros. A car from the hotel will also run you over to the train station for free between 8:00 and10:00 AM. Our room was a comfortable size and spotlessly clean with a firm, comfortable bed, flat-screen TV, and minibar. The bathroom was very modern with an excellent shower and a bidet. All equipment was in perfect working order and the water was hot. We could open the windows onto a pleasant courtyard with palm trees and onto the lovely countryside. Roman winters are quite mild (usually in the 50s), but come prepared for some rain. The hotel provides an excellent breakfast with an assortment of sliced meat and cheeses, pastries, breads, cereal, milk, fruit, and yogurt. The staff makes coffee to order and delivers it to your table. The hotel desk is staffed 24 hours a day. We enjoyed fast, free internet wireless service, allowing us to post daily pictures to friends back home. Probably the single best thing about Veio Park Hotel is the friendly, helpful staff. The desk clerks all speak fairly good English, and they tirelessly answered my questions. They provided maps and transportation information for our daily excursions into the city. They also researched sites on the internet for us and made reservations. Everyone we saw on the staff greeted us and attended promptly to any requests. One clerk showed us how we could catch a night bus back from the Colosseum area on New Year's Eve after the trains stopped running at 10:30. However, it rained that evening and we decided not to venture out. The next day she was very worried about us, for she learned that the bus had been canceled without notice. She was visibly relieved to learn that we had not been stranded in downtown Rome. We felt lucky to have avoided an expensive taxi bill, but also impressed by her personal concern for our welfare.

It's recommended that you eat dinner in town before returning since the closest restaurants are about 15 min. walking along a major avenue. The walk was a bit stressful so we did it only once. If you stay out in Rome late, keep in mind that the last train returning is at 10pm so you will need a taxi after that time. Taxis cost between 20-30 euros. The down side really is the fact that the front desk ladies could be more welcoming and could explain the amenities a bit more thoroughly. No one told us about the free shuttle service to the train station in the mornings from 8-10. I knew because I read it in a review. I got the feeling they really don't want everyone to know about this. Also, their phone number was incorrect and I was not able to reach them once in Europe.
