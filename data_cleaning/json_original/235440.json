The hotel provides a great base. The location is right on the main highway, so it was easy to get started up the Valley and to get to Sonoma. Even though the hotel is on the highway it is separated by a frontage road and the rooms go back away from the highway. We did not hear any street noise. It's only about 5 minutes from downtown Napa. There is a Target store on the other side of the highway that was convenient for bottled water and a few other necessities. As others have written the rooms were exceptionally clean and the staff was helpful. Even a little snafu at check in, they somehow had us with two rooms reserved instead of one, the problem was resolved in a minute. The breakfast in the hotel is very good. it may seem high at $12.95, but that includes coffee, juice and milk, so it's really not so bad. They call it a buffet, but you basically order about anything you want from the waitress and she brings it to you. I had eggs benedict one morning and a crepe the next. You help yourself to drinks, fresh fruit and pastries. It was good to get a big breakfast f=before a day of wine tasting. We also enjoyed the jacuzzi in the evening and the complementary wine tsting aon Friday and Saturday were another bonus. They have lots of coupons for two for one wine tastings, so make sure you ask at the front desk. We got a coupon for the Hess Collection. It's a beautiful drive into the hills close to the hotel. It was definitely one of the highlights for us.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!

There was only one waitress on staff at the time, so she didn't have a whole lot of time to explain the details to us, but this is the gist: you seat yourself, it's basically self-serve, but you can order anything you want from the grill too. If your meal is comped like ours was, just leave the card that the front desk gave you on your table after the meal, or give it to the server if they ask for it. I had the buttermilk pancakes, which were pretty good. This hotel is a little different, but in a good way. It has a rather small business center, but it also has a room with a TV, board games, and lots of books available too. So if you have kids with you that are old enough to look after themselves for a little while, this could be something for them to do rather than be dragged along with the adults watching them drink wine all day. There's also a fitness center tucked into a corner on the first floor, which I actually saw people using, so I assumed it was fairly decent. The area is mostly filled with little boutique B & B's, which aren't really my style. I was a little tempted by the Napa River Inn, but I think given the choice when I come back, the Hilton Garden Inn is a safe bet.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, location not that great\u201d", "Author": "quicktraveler91", "ReviewID": "UR117332698", "Content": "This was a typical Hilton with a napa twist on the interiors.

A good value for the money. Things to be aware of: - It's essentially on the frontage road alongside Highway 29, which makes it convenient, but isolated. Plan on driving, which you probably were anyway. You won't be walking anywhere for dinner unless you like the fish tacos at the (nice) restaurant a couple blocks to the south. Excellent grocery store there, as well as Starbucks, by the way. The Trader Joe's is across the Highway 29 overpass--not a convenient walk. - The pool is postage-stamp-sized, so don't get your kids excited about major splashing. - Bathrooms (especially the tub area) are a bit grotty, but nothing horrible. - Beds in the two-bed rooms are doubles, not queens. - The breakfast pricing is a bit of a mystery--seemed like $11 for the cooked-to-order food versus...$11 for the continental breakfast. Go figure. - No connecting rooms, but the HGI was able to accommodate our request for adjacent rooms.

Gourmet meal on the way up. Nice tour and tasting. They gave us each a memento wine glass as well. On the way back down we sat in the dessert car (both delicious and beautiful). --Mumm Napa - (~$15/person) Beautiful sitting area to taste their sparkling wines (and another sitting area to taste their more expensive ones as well). They have an online coupon to print off before you go on their website. V. Sattui - they have a museum and picnic area for items purchased there, we didn't get a chance to taste because we got there too late :-( Alpha and Omega - (hotel wine pass - $20/person without) - Beautiful vineyard and tasting room That's all we had time for in a day and a half since most wineries seem to close at 5. Oenotri is a fun Italian restaurant downtown where we had Salumi (salami tasting plate) which was a new experience for us (and also delicious).

The Hotel and the rooms are spotless clean. It is located not far from the main road, but not exactly right by it. So it was nice and quiet.

Hotwire had nothing in Napa proper except the Vino Bello, which we didn't want and weren't going to pay $300+ a night for. Priceline had nothing except what was probably the Vino Bello at a $264/night counteroffer (meaning availability at about $239). The Marriott next door was almost $300/night at the Marriott site, and, in the end, wouldn't have been worth an extra $100/night. In short, rooms were tight, so we went with this, eyes-wide-open, knowing we weren't going to get some kind of Four Seasons Spa experience, but were hoping to get a decent place to stay in a good location. We knew that HGI was Hilton's answer to Courtyard by Marriott; personally I find it a brighter, friendlier version of that chain, with a nice color scheme and furnishings and very professional management. What we wanted was exactly what the Hilton Garden Inn (\"HGI\") provided: a modern, exquisitely-clean, quality hotel with a location near the highway in the city of Napa. We didn't need a super-fancy room or traditional \"resort\" amenities, because we planned to spend our time at the wineries and at great restaurants in the area, not in a pool or sunning ourselves or eating room service. We didn't want a musty bed-and-breakfast, or someplace (like Vino Bello) with (rumoured) super-thin walls. For $209/night, the HGI fit the bill more than we ever expected, and was still way cheaper than what was available in Napa that weekend. Room: Impeccably-clean. Recently-updated with the HGI signature interior, including the signature work chair (and nice big desk), allergen-free pillows, and firmness-adjustable mattress. (It still had that \"new room smell\", in a good way.) Free high-speed Wireless internet throughout the rooms and public spaces (with wired conx in the room if you still want to use your blue cable or don't [gasp!] have Wi-Fi), print documents to business center, great shower head and shower-curtain that is see-through from shoulders-up, unstoppable hot water in the morning, microwave, fridge, coffeemaker with decent coffee, iron and ironing board in closet, weekday laundry and dry-cleaning service, typical Lodgenet tube TV. As with all HGIs, there's a 24-hour \"pantry\" next to the front desk with the usual stuff-you-left-at-home-dang-it, as well as bottles of coke for $1, zone bars, and frozen items you can cook in your microwave, like Lean Cuisine, Hot Pockets, Burritos, etc. (Trader Joes nearby also has good stuff you can microwave.) They don't kill you on the prices of this stuff, which I appreciated. I have seen a few reviews that say that the mattress is very firm. Well, yeah, if you don't adjust it. The adjustment knob is on the side of the bed by each person's head, which allows you to make it as firm or as soft as you wish, within reason. How to use it (as well as how to adjust the signature work chair) is in the \"In-Room Comfort Guide\" that one finds on any HGI pillow, but many folks probably don't read. Did I say the room was clean? Wow, was it ever! Also, most evenings, there's a big basket of free cookies at the front desk, just baked by the restaurant staff. Staff: Despite old reviews on here to the contrary, we found the staff -- and I mean every single person -- to be what Hilton calls \"genuine\" and friendly. Down-to-earth friendly. \"How's my favorite couple?\"-friendly. They must have either replaced or retrained the front desk staff from the early bad reviews, because they all went out of their way to be friendly, fun and helpful. When the restaurant was closed before we arrived one night, the Chef (in his chef's coat) gave us a number of great suggestions where to go (the Red Hen Mexican place on the same service road a few blocks North is GREAT!). When we checked in just after noon, they found us a nice room in a quiet wing, and as we were walking to our room, we passed numerous housekeeping people, all of whom made a point of looking us in the eye, smiling, and welcoming us. That's just plain good training and nice people. Location: The HGI is located right next door to the Napa Marriott, and right on the service road for the main highway from the city of Napa into the vineyards. If you stay South of Napa (like at the Vino Bello or further south at the Fairfield Inn by Sea World), you add a good 20 minutes in each direction to your trip North of the city of Napa into the countryside with the vineyards, which would be a drag. If you stay deeper in the city of Napa, you have to fight through a lot of lights to get back to the main highway to the vineyards. At the HGI, it's get up, get in car, go to vineyards. The hotel is about a 15 minute cab ride (or car ride, but we didn't want to drink and drive) to the Wine Train in the center of Napa, with all the traffic lights. We went to the Wine Train by Hopper, which is like a powered Rickshaw (or Tuk-Tuk as you may have seen it referred to in books or movies). Hotel recommended it and made the call to them for us; they showed up right away, and it was fun and quick. They were waiting for us at the Wine Train when it got back. Different driver. Equivalently-super-friendly. In short, we found the location to be just completely optimal for what we wanted to do. Here's a note on location. None of the major chains or resorts really offer what most people think they're gonna get in a romantic wine-country vacation: a location where you step out of bed, walk on your room terrace, and look at the beautiful vineyard just steps away, surrounded solely by beautiful mountains and grapes. The development regulations appear not to permit it. Even the Auberge du Soleil, where we enjoyed dinner one night, really doesn't fit this bill. You can pay $1500 a room night there and still get only to look down into the valley. The Renaissance is in the middle of town in Sonoma. The new Westin will be downtown Napa. The Marriott is on the highway (and nice but not as modern as the HGI). The Sheraton is in Petaluma, a good 35+-minute drive from Napa (and even more from the Napa Valley vineyards), and the Hyatt and Doubletree are more in Santa Rosa, which is a nice area but much more built up and almost an hour from Napa. The love-it-or-hate-it Vino Bello is South of town in a new-ish development of office buildings and that resort; the office buildings don't predominate, but are a little off-putting. That said, Vino Bello really is the only place that actually feels like it's out in the Vineyards (even if that feeling disappears when you look over at the office park). We went to a place called St Francis Winery north of Sonoma, which actually offers dining and tasting in the kind of new, modern, Mission-inspired-architecture, clean facility that still lets you take-off-your-shoes, walk out on the manicured grass and right into the vines in the shadow of the mountain kind of environment that one could wish a resort would do, but doesn't. (If St. Francis could add rooms, which they can't, they'd be mobbed given their picture-postcard setting. As it is, they do dining, tastings and lotsa picture-perfect weddings.) Given that such a resort really doesn't exist here, particularly for $200/night, we were delighted to have a clean, quiet, modern, friendly place to come back to after a day in the vines and tasting rooms. Price: Napa isn't cheap. Yes, some HGIs in other places that aren't Napa offer the same type of accommodation for less money. But they aren't in Napa. Napa is expensive. Don't like it? Stay in Santa Rosa, which isn't Napa but where you can get a Priceline name-your-own-price rate at many of the best chain hotels for $75/night or less (see biddingfortravel.com or betterbidding.com for more details). But if you're staying in Napa, it really isn't fair to say that this HGI is overpriced. It's really a great deal compared to its competition on busy weekends. And that's the only fair way to evaluate it. You're not going to be \"pampered\" here, but you will be taken care of in a genuine, friendly, professional manner. Food: Didn't have dinner here, but breakfast was very good. For the HGI price of $10/person, maybe you can get breakfast somewhere else cheaper. (There's a Jack in the Box across from the shopping center with Target, Trader Joes, etc., for example.) But for a no-nonsense hot breakfast with omelets made-to-order, Starbucks-coffee, nice assortment of breakfast meats, breakfast fruits, cereals, pastries, etc., where you can seat yourself and be done in 20 minutes no problem if you're in a hurry, the HGI facility ROCKS! The waiter couldn't have been more energetic or friendly, busting his butt to provide a sense of caring and service and to cash out folks super-fast if they needed to go, but not rushing them if they wanted to linger. When he brought us water, my g/f apologized for rushing him because we were in a hurry. He actually said, \"Don't apologize, that's what I'm here for. I'm happy to help.\" Pinch me. I'm clearly in Oz. The restaurant is clean, bright, friendly, and has very good-quality food. I think the continental breakfast is cheaper, and HGI also has a room rate that's $10/night higher that gives you breakfast for up to 4 people in the room (i.e. as cheap as $2.50/person). If we had known how much we would like the breakfast, we would have done that, because we ended up eating in the restaurant every morning. I noticed that a fair number of people were using the evening room service, which has (to my mind) fairly-decently-priced American favorites, like steak, burgers, etc. The plates on the trays outside the rooms looked licked-clean, so I guess dinner must be as good as breakfast. There's also a bound album on the coffee table in the lobby that contains photos and menus from many of the area's better restaurants, so you can see for yourself where you might like to eat in town. Guest Profile: This seemed to be a mix of 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s, mostly without kids. Mostly couples and groups of business-guys or vacationing-guys. Mostly mature and well-behaved. Didn't notice any screaming, running, trampling or otherwise-intrusive kids (or adults). Overview: A clean, comfortable, modern, 3-story hotel, right off the main highway in the city of Napa, with digital-thermostat-controlled individual-room heat/cool units that are powerful enough to chill the room down on a hot day within minutes, plenty of free parking, a friendly-and-attentive staff, a great shower and good amenities.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel, don't stay here!!\u201d", "Author": "runner40", "ReviewID": "UR18157874", "Content": "I stayed here with my husband and my daughter for one weekend.

If you do not use the B&B option I think the breakfast is overpriced, but it is convenient. The service provided by ALL the staff was outstanding during our entire 4 night stay.

Our room was the typical HGI room-2 queen beds, flat screen TV, microwave, refrig, coffee maker, hairdryer, etc. The room was very clean and looked brand new. Some of our group rented suites and these rooms provided a somewhat separate living area with a sleep sofa. Good choice for a family of 4 or more. On most nights there were complimentary wine tastings w/cheeses in the lobby. The HGI is located near the highway and is convenient for driving to Yountville for dinner or further for the Napa vineyard areas.

I say that because in comparison to other HGI's, the breakfast was tiny. Also, there was no buffet style, you asked the cook for service. While I think that's fine, he was quite stingy. NEVER try to get more than two slices of bacon at one time! The waiter at breakfast seemed offended when I mentioned that their breakfast was smaller than other HGI's I've stayed with. They not only offered just one type of juice (most of the other ones have offered 3-4) they didn't offer chocolate milk, a toaster that worked, waffles (even though the machine was in plain view in the kitchen), muffins...but I'll stop being petty. Otherwise, this hotel is almost perfect for the location. Most of the huge Napa wineries are just down the road, a 5 minute drive and you're in the heard of the wine country! There are pleanty of good places to eat in the area (Try Fume' for brunch, it can't be beat). Also, just down Solano Ave, the road the hotel is located on, you can find Starbucks, Squeezeburger, companies that will ship wine and the Napa Premium Outlet mall. Ok, another complaint, no hot coffee during the day. Lots of HGI's have coffee pots out for all day self-service...not this one.

(Prefer this area over to the few others at downtown/first street areas where can get pretty crowded during holidays.) Checkin is quick. Staff is friendly and really accomodative. Had an issue with the initial room being close to the elevator and ice machine. They didnt have one to switch at the time. But couple hours later, a staff pro-actively approached me and said a cancellation made one available, and it even has a jacuzzi in the room. We switch it for the same rate. Sweet deal. The bathroom with jacuzzi is huge for this class, separate shower and separate doored toilet. The jacuzzi has a wooden window that swings out to the room, pretty cool. We love it. Clean, refreshing environment, newly remodelled rooms and enclosed facility. Nice view if the room is facing the soccer field. Great rates too.", "Date": "September 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cReally Nice Time\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3801642", "Content": "So many good points...where to start? The room we had was huge, the bathroom had a jacuzzi tub, a stand up shower, 2 sinks and a seperate toilet closet. The hotel is situated centrally off the main road into the Napa Valley and we easily got to most of the vineyards and restaurants. The staff was great as well. We came home one day from a few (well a lot) of wine tastings and for the lack of a better word, were loaded. They helped us find a pizza place that delivered and called for us without giving us a hard time. My only negative on the place is that there are shutters between the bathroom and the rest of the room which makes the main room a little noisey and bright if someone has to hit the head in the middle of the night. All of that, combined with the price, I found it to be a steal.", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3501042", "Content": "We've stayed here probably 10 times over the last couple of years. Clean, comfortable, very nice staff. Located on the North end of Napa, it's about 10 min from Yountville, 25 min from St. Helena. Centrally located to all the wineries and great restaurants. Compare the prices and it's an AWESOME value. When most of the comparable hotels (including the Marriott next door, which I don't think is nearly as nice) run over $300 in the high season, this one usually tops out at $199. (often 1/2 that in the off-season). Decent breakfast with cook-to-order egg and pancake bar. Because it is a little far south in the Valley, you'll want to plan your daytrips and wine-tasting starting with the Northern-most destinations and work your way south. That way, by the end of a long afternoon of wine-tasting, you're close to your hotel. :-)", "Date": "May 25, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Garden Inn Napa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32766-d235440-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Napa-Napa_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$177 - $268*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3585 Solano Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Napa</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94558</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "235440", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f9/6e/f96ed2be4a776372a5efe7553460f7516large.jpg"}}
