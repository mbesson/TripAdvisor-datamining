Overall satisfied but I think the hotel is too 'materialistic', I'll be talking more about it later. Strategically located on conviniently and closed to famous Singapore shopping centre and food courts so shopping and dining is easy! Room is spacious and clean with complete amenities like hair dryer, iron, safety box, etc. You can even request for different type of pillow! My fav is the water-filled pillow! My only complaint would be it price! I paid over SGP350 per night for the room but didnt get breakfast and internet connection which should be free for this kind of hotel. Breakfast cost me another 28 dollar per person (food also not recommended) and 30 something for the internet connection!

We stayed in a king bed deluxe suite which had a separate lounge room from the bedroom. It was very spacious and large for the 3 of us. The hotel is spotlessly clean and very well presented. There was a minor hiccup on check in, but that was quickly resolved. Everyone is eager to please. We stayed in room 522 which was at the rear of the hotel and looked out at Cuppage Plaza. The view isn\u2019t much to speak of. Cuppage Plaza has a great laundry store which only charged 12SGD for a bag of washing, very cheap, quick and efficient. We had use of the Executive lounge which is well worth. Along with breakfast in the morning either in the lounge or main restaurant, there was afternoon tea and evening drinks and canap\u00e9s. It is very well run and the ladies there are excellent, Service is first class. The room was very comfortable and the amenities were great. We made use of the small gym and pool area. The pool was nice after a long day shopping. The gym is very small and was well attended on most days. All in all our stay was most enjoyable and we would return without doubt. Value for money, for Singapore and the three of us was well worth it. The hotel is very well run, the service is first class, and we enjoyed ourselves there. Orchard Road and the MRT rail system is a very short walk away from the hotel. We were staying there as part of our 20th wedding celebrations.

Our son was 17 years old at the time and stayed for free (children are considered to be up to 17 years of age). Also it is great for him to have a real bed also instead of a rollaway. There were two very comfortable double beds. I am quite particular about beds and these were very supportive but not like concrete and no sagging. The choice of both soft and firm pillows in the room is good too. The room was quite spacious and there was a desk chair plus a comfy lounge chair. Our room was on the highway side with a view to the jungle-like park on the other side. I thought that the hum of traffic would intrude during the night but it did not. (We stayed here for 1 night a couple of years ago and our room was on the other side of the hotel and the sound of night revelry did intrude). The hotel supplies bottled water each day - we rarely needed to buy any. On arrival we were welcomed most hospitably - all the staff are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was most enjoyable and we ended up signing up for breakfast for each morning in advance which then saved some money. We had dinner in the same setting one evening at their buffet - it was very busy and noisy. The food was quite good and the value average. We also ate one evening in their Indian restaurant which was absolutely delicious. Generally we ate out and the hotel is conveniently located opposite the Cuppage Centre along which are numerous restaurants with both indoor and outdoor seating. Also Orchard Road is only a block away via the Cuppage Centre and here you will also find an MTR station. Being one block back from the razzle dazzle of Orchard Road is also calming. The roof top swimming pool is very private and inviting. It is also a good length for laps which is a good way to soothe sore muscles from all the walking. If we stay in Singapore in the future I would not look elsewhere for accommodation - I would automatically book here.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay and location\u201d", "Author": "ChasingSunshine", "ReviewID": "UR128297457", "Content": "I booked two rooms with double beds for three nights.

The photos do not do it justice, as soon as we arrived we where all impressed with the foyer, lobby and all communal areas, everything is very plush. We had two rooms for five of us and both rooms where lovely, no balconies which we thought where a dissapointment at first but soon realised that Singapore is just too hot and humid to be bothered sitting on one so not a dissadvantage at all. We had the facilities of the executive rooms so benefitted from breakfast in quieter more plush surroundings although the normal restaurant was fine. We also had afternoon tea and canapes early evening, all this and drinks included in the price along with free wi fi. The pool is lovely, just a nice temperature, I hate the water being too cold and the sun loungers where so thick and very comfy . All the staff, from reception, bar, restaurant, door men, porters, absolutely everyone where the most proffessional and courteous staff we have ever come accross, and we are all quite well travelled.

Singapore hotels have in recent years become hugely expensive and with breakfast for a family of 4, a stay here would be close to \u00a3200 a night inclusive of taxes etc. For a Holiday Inn that is expensive. Checking was thoroughly professional and my platinum status was acknowledged with an offer to upgrade to a suite however with just 1 bed. I turned down the offer and thanked them whereupon free Internet and free breakfast was offered. Then there was 4 free welcome drinks in the bar and an offer of late checkout. It was a great start! The room on the 8 th floor was as far from the elevator as you could get but the modern sleek and spotless room made up for the walk. The picture window looked out onto a building which was a shame but a park vew would be wonderful for the massive picture window. The bathrooms were modern and well equipped. The flat screen TV had useful and accessible access for iPod plugs etc and was easy to use. There was a dVD player also and a extensive mini bar and free tea and coffee. All in all a great room. We went to the bar for a free welcome drink to find that it offered a wide range of drinks including alcohol and cocktails. It was perhaps the best welcome ever at a hotel and included all 4 of us and not just the card holder or adults. I estimate that the drinks would have costs around \u00a330. The service was superb from very welcoming and chatty staff. We checked out early and the hotel stored our bags for the day. Upon our return we were permitted access to the pool and showers where we freshen up before catching our long flight home. The location is great right on Orchard and next to a great range of eateries. It is howver expensive but then all Singapore hotels are.

The hotel is at one of the best locations one can possibly be at in Singapore. There is almost everything at a walking distance from the hotel and the best thing is that there are a lot of local food restaurants where you can taste the local food and that at a very reasonable price. Even though there is no issue of halal food in Singapore but still at times i wanted to eat something cheap and something different from K.f.c, Mcdonalds and Burger king(these 3 are halal everywhere in Singapore and available almost every 4 kilometers) and the local restaurants were right in front of the hotel. The added advantage is that you are right in front of one of the best shopping centre's and then you are 2 minutes away from Mrt. The staff is excellent,humble and very helpful. They were very courteous and the best thing was that everyone was smiling always and that surely makes one feel good no matter how bad you are feeling. It was not only me but my kids as well who enjoyed the stay and i never felt that i was alone to take care of the kids. Whenever i got a bit busy with the concierge or the reception,someone from the hotel staff was already there to take care of my children so i would say that it was amazing to feel like home away from home. The breakfast was amazing specially the fresh juices they served and the helpful attendants. One of the best things about the breakfast was that they had different set of dining for the kids and in different colours as well. Overall i would rate the hotel 9/10 except for the 'internet'! It wasn't free in the first place and even the charges were too high for a country like Singapore and apart from that i feel that internet should be free as per compliments from the hotel because you are staying at a 4star+ property!

From the outside, it is a fairly low rise hotel, a little non descript. I think it has a total of 4 storey's. The location is excellent, just off Orchard Road. Within a 5 minute walk, you are amongst an abundance of food choices - Singapore is certainly a culinary delight. Shopping Malls are located along Orchard Road. I noticed a Starbucks within a 5 minute walk and various bars. March is a pleasant time to visit - weaher wise, so enjoyed strolling around the area. Check in was swift and friendly. It was a business trip but despite this, could not fault the location at all, without a doubt, it would suit business and leisure travelers alike. I am a smoker and usually, not given the best rooms in a hotel - nor floor. I had the business lounge as part of my room rate, including wi fi and wired internet. Both worked fine. The room appeared a little dated, I had 2 double beds, which was fine. Sleep quality was good, ample pillows and all together, the room was a decent size. The bathroom was equally dated. Shower was in the tub and whilst there were 2 shower heads, the pressure was not fantastic. Closet space was ok for the short trip. I had noisy neighbours and since there was an inter-connecting door, put the volume down to that. I am a heavy sleeper, so it did not bother me too much. Certainly no street noise. I took breakfast in the main area one morning. Staff were friendly and there was a fairly decent spread, but the dining area was cramped and dated. They need to get rid of the carpet and spruce the place up. The remainder of my mornings and whe I arrived back at the hotel in the evenings, would go to the club lounge. The club lounge lacks reading materials and is not particularly big. However, both breakfast and evenings cocktails/snacks are fine. Overall, I found the staff make this place, in particular those in the club lounge - whom I interracted the most with. The location is perfect. I would rate this a full thumbs up but for 2 things : Bedroom windows are filthy outside. Considering it's a low storey buildining, really no excuse.

I've been inside this hotel before but haven't stayed. During my stay, I had a good accommodation. When I first entered the lobby, they have a very welcoming aura. However, I should've stayed in the room that is facing the Orchard road. So that would be my advice for those who are planning to stay in this hotel. It seems that the hotel is fully booked during my stay so I was assigned to a room facing the highway. I missed the sight of the wonderful Christmas lights along the Orchard road from the hotel. I cannot complain about the location of the hotel. It's not along the busy road of Orchard, but it is very reachable as it is just at the Somerset Area. It's very close to other restaurants, malls, and to the mrt station. My tip is that it's also close to other massage centres. When I entered my room, it has a good spacious feeling. Compliment fruits are already on the table. A safe is provided. There's a working desk with phone. A phone can also be found on the bedside table and in the bathroom. A large-screen flat TV (although not enough channels) is hooked on the wall opposite the bed. A DVD player and and iPod dock is also provided. There are also hub for connecting your PC/laptop to the TV, if you have the proper cables. They also have universal socket, so don't worry if you're coming from Europe and forgot your universal adapter. Internet is provided in every room, although you have to assess which package of internet connection is practical. It depends on one's duration of stay. The bathroom has very good lighting and clean. There's no separate shower cabin, so the shower is also at the tub with a separate glass. They have fog-free mirrors, clean towels daily, and toiletries. Importantly, the bed mattress is very comfortable. 2 types of pillows are provided - firm and soft. Although you can order special pillows - hypo-allergenic, memory foam, body to lie on, and magnetic therapy. Thus, they really make sure that when you take a rest in their hotel, you really feel rested :). This hotel has also good facilities (pool, 1 restaurants for non-members, gym, sauna, bar, computer station). The concierge are friendly although they could've been more updated with what's happening around Singapore since they weren't aware of the electronic sale going on at the Expo when I asked about it. Room service is prompt. The menu, however, doesn't have a long list of dishes to choose from. So better to eat at the restaurant. They have an open bar, just beside the check-in counter and with entertainment when the sun dawns. My accommodation is inclusive of breakfast so I had a good taste of the choices of dishes they provided for their guests. Their breakfast has a wide range of dishes - Japanese, Chinese, Malay, Indian and continental. You can order on demand for which type of coffee or tea you want. That also goes for freshly extracted fruit juice and egg. Since the hotel is quite full during my stay, the refill of dishes at the buffet table was not as quick as I would've wished it to be. And this happened not only once but for several times. Servers are friendly, although they tend to be friendlier and more attentive to non-Asian guests. All in all, I had a favorable stay at Holiday Inn Ochard Centre during my 2-week business trip.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFirst rate service and excellent value.\u201d", "Author": "Marie3233", "ReviewID": "UR123089159", "Content": "Searched high and low for a hotel that offered a suite with separate lounge and bedroom areas for less than SD$1,000.

I know that the Intercontinental Hotel Group has invested heavily in improving its mid-range brand and in this case, it has certainly paid off. The Holiday Inn, Orchard City Centre, formally The Parkview, is a relatively small hotel with 319 Rooms, now dubbed \u2018boutique\u2019 by its owners; it is an outstanding example of re-branding success. I have stayed in most of the high end hotels in Singapore, including the latest addition, the Marina Bay Sands and this one compares favourably with its big brothers. The rooms have undergone a total refurbishment, which has brought them well up to 5 star standard, in all but size. They all boast high speed internet access, a proliferation of electric points, an iPhone/iPod dock, plenty of TV channels, excellent lighting and a pillow menu, everything one would expect from a hotel charging considerably more. What makes this Holiday Inn exceptional however, are not the refurbished rooms and facilities but the staff, staff training in this hotel is of the highest standard, all are efficient, charming and helpful beyond the call of duty. The technical services were also remarkable; we had a computer hiccup whilst staying at the hotel and they made their technical manager available to us and he was a great help, he fixed everything, explained the problem and gave us a lesson on how to cope with the vagaries of net access in Asia. The club lounge is one of the best I have used, breakfast is superb, very good canap\u00e9s and snacks are provided during happy hour and the service is incomparable. The restaurant on floor B1 which describes itself as \u2018North Indian\u2019 is one of the best Indian restaurants I know and I being a fan of a good curry, I have eaten in many, all over the world. Don\u2019t bother fighting for taxis in Little India, eat here and be delighted by the service, atmosphere and cuisine. I can heartily recommend the seafood set menu, which boasts a starter of spicy crab meat, lobster and prawn, excellent!

I certainly wouldn't say Holiday Inn was value for money as we were paying almost same as we paid for our Villa in Bali. However the two plus points of the hotel are the location of hotel and availability of Indian food at the Tandoor restaurant in the hotel. The hotel is located just a block away from the main Orchard street which was beautifully decorated for Christmas and has all the malls lined up there. We spent our first evening on the Orchard street shopping through the all decorated malls instead of sitting in the room. All the other things at hotel just follow the 'Holiday Inn' standards. No place to complaint really. Room service was good. Food at restaurant was 'not bad' (not great either). To conclude Holiday Inn is a safe bait as compared to other hotels in Singapore.

This Hotel is very comfortable and is in a great location as others have said. The staff were pleasant and helpful, from checking-in at reception to checking-out. The checking in was rather protracted - due to a booking error on our part with two rooms booked (and the wrong combination of double and king beds requested for our extended family), but we got there in the end. We requested close proximity of the rooms if possible, and the Hotel obliged with a set of rooms with an adjoining door - we couldn't have asked for better, especially with our 18 month old able to flutter between Nan's room and mum and dad. :-) We were in the std Premier Rooms. They are clean and well appointed. Nice LCD panel with external inputs all ready for you to plug your media device into and play through the panel. (PC VGA, S-Video and composite video inputs, and L/R audio inputs). Also a DVD player with USB input for DivX is in place ready to go as well. The bathroom is well sized with a nice bath/shower combination. Good sized mirror which never seemed to steam up to an \"unuseable\" extent when in the shower - I wish other hotels could review the ventilation in this bathroom and match it in theirs! We took the room and breakfast package, and in all honesty the buffet breakfast is fairly standard for Singapore in terms of choice (mixture of Asian and European hot and cold choices), but it ALWAYS seemed to be very fresh no matter what time you arrived to eat, even down to the freshly squeezed orange juice. Jerie and her team put on a nice spread every morning and it kept us going through the day. A little play area for the kids is in the corner of the restaurant and ALL the staff loved the kids that were there, our youngster being no exception. We had room service two nights during our stay - due to arrival back late from tours and we couldn't be bothered to wander into the neighbouring cafes and restaurants - of which there are plenty. Good choice of room service up to 11pm, and after this there is still a reasonable selection of hot and cold food if you have the munchies at some crazy hour. And again, the food arrived hot, and it was full of flavour and very, very fresh. Room service is not cheap, but then you are paying for the convenience. We have read a couple of reports of rudness of staff - we never experienced this, but perhaps after struggling to get our message across once or twice, we can understand that this may lead to an element of frustration between the various parties. I'm not going to suggest that other Trip Advisor contributors have not had a bad experience - only that we struggled a few times but got through it... without walking away feeling that anybody was being rude or impolite. We didn't get to the pool or other hotel facilities, but they appear to be standard, down to the mini-bars, coffee and tea making facilities and safes etc in each room. My only criticism is that for internet access, you have to include it in your booking at an additional S$25/day (or it will be included in your room rate if you are taking an Exec room package). It's not cheap and you'd be better looking at other unsecured WiFi hotspots in Singapore if you cannot purchase a data-pack from your local carrier before you visit Singapore (e.g. McDonalds cafes) . The locals almost have WiFi coverage everywhere and it is unsecured, but as I understand it, to be able to use it you have to have a valid and current SIngapore Carrier mobile number. This minor internet access issue aside, this is a wonderful Hotel in a great location, and we'll be forgoing our previous regular \"Royal\" Scotts Rd hotel from now on to stay here.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kortrijk, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly located hotel, walking distance to Orchard Road.\u201d", "Author": "BDeMaert", "ReviewID": "UR121280230", "Content": "The negative things to the place are: the front of the hotel is right next to one of the busiest roads into the city, so expect a lot of traffic.

Reception at the hotel was very pleasant after some 20+ hours of airports and flying, check-in went rapid, got offered some tea and a bottle of water. Staff is friendly and helpful at all times. The Executive room itself was spacious, and free soft-drinks from the minibar (and daily refills), 2 pieces of free laundry daily, and enough channels on the TV in case you were to tired to do anything else. Comes with a spacious enough bathroom and all necessities. If you have access to the Lounge, use it. It's well worth it, with a wide selection of appetizers in the early evening.

Now back to the Holiday Inn, the breakfast buffet was great and provided a good mix of food - in fact it was great trying something each day. We stayed at the Holiday Inn for a week and the service and staff were very accommodating. The two older men that greeted us at the entrance to the Holiday Inn were amazing and I think they must have worked at the Holiday Inn for a long time - never did I not see a smile on their faces. The only minor negative, was that our room did smell a little musty, but I think this was because it was so muggy and humid outside that the air conditioning inside was compensating for this. It wasn't an overly offensive smell, but was noticeable. On our next visit we will definitely stay here again and will try the upgrade to the Executive Club. Holiday Inn you made our week in Singapore a delight and we will be back to see you :)", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winston Hills", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location, fantastic staff\u201d", "Author": "lwo", "ReviewID": "UR117301794", "Content": "Very satisfied with our time at this Hotel.

I'm so glad that I chose Holiday Inn Orchard. I booked 2months in advance, and they gave all the requests I asked for. We were even given complimentary minibar (drinks only) by reservations as it was our anniversary. This is a big plus - we didn't need to buy bottled water outside or other drinks AT ALL. the drinks in the minibar were replenished everyday & was more than sufficient. From the reservations dept to front desk to executive lounge to housekeeping - service was excellent. We were traveling with a 17 month old who got sick when we arrived in Singapore, and they really took care of us. They sent us to their affiliate GP clinic to get meds for the baby & everyday they'd check up on how we were all doing. Breakfast was included in the rate we paid and was very good value. We ate breakfast once at the executive lounge but preferred the restaurant on the 2nd flr as the spread was more extensive - all you can think of having for breakfast. This kept us from going hungry until afternoon. Again, for booking early, the hotel website had a promo of complimentary late checkout til 4pm, which was great since our flight was @ 6:45pm. I think we got more for the price we paid. Checkout took less than 5mins, and we paid nothing more. no hidden charges. some impt info: 1. taxi to almost all the places we went to was cheap, we didn't need to take the mrt esp traveling with a baby -Taxi from airport only cost us $18sgd (we arrived at 6am in singapore); Taxi going to airport (around 3pm) cost $20sgd 2. laundry service \"Laundry Day\" in cuppage plaza just behind the hotel is cheap but clean. we paid $12sgd for 3.5kg of laundry 3. food during breakfast was labelled halal or non halal.

Holiday Inns in the US don't tend to be much to write home about, but was I ever wrong. This Holiday Inn is newly renovated and one look at the fabulous, sleek modern lobby and you know it will be a great stay. I arrived off a 22 hour plan ride just after mid-night and the front desk staff could not have been more friendly or efficient. I checked in and headed to my King Room. Sparkling clean. Fabulous. Beautiful modern decor with all of the amenities one would expect in a upscale business hotel. The bed linens were comfy and the mattress was a dream. Wonderful toiletries in the bathroom meant I didn't need to break out the supply I usually travel with (I'm a toiletry snob as you'll find if you read my other reviews.) The work out facility is more than adequate. While it's very small, there is everything you need to get a great workout. I love the towels, fruit and cold bottled water they provide. Nice touch. There is a lovely roof top pool that I am sorry I didn't get to use but it looked great. Breakfast is included in the price of the King room and I found it to be very good. Lots of good variety from Japanese breakfast selections, to traditional Chinese dishes such as congee along with standard American fare. The staff throughout the hotel are friendly and helpful.

Moreover even for first time visitors this is not a bad option for the hotel is just a 10 minute walk away from the Singapore visitor centre, that apart the the MRT station is a mere 5 minute walk away & access to public transportation is easy & fast. Stayed here for 4 nights towards the end of June to the first week of July. Check in was prompt & courteous. Got wifi connectivity vouchers complimentary plus a discount voucher for a meal at the Hotels restaurant which was a nice gesture. Stayed in a junior suite which was large & comfortable with all the fittings & amenities associated with the global Holiday Inn chain of hotels. A comfortable bed with a pillow menu, Large screen TV with an interesting choice of channels & fairly acceptable bathroom amenities. Had one meal at the Hotel's Indian restaurant called Tandoor & would highly recommend this to all. I will go as far as to say that the quality of food served here was better than quite a few of the restaurant\u2019s of the same class & caliber back in India. The hotel swimming pool on the top floor was of a decent size & good functional gym was also on offer. Several restaurants & eateries dot the neighborhood so one can never go without a meal. On to the not so good parts, the room air conditioning was certainly below par & took a long time to cool the room to the extent we wanted. We got a non smoking room unfortunately and it seems that the previous occupants were heavy smoker\u2019s for it took almost a day or so before the smell dissipated, again I attribute this to the weak air conditioning. Also felt the general lighting in the room could be improved, for with all the lights on also we felt at times that the room was dimly lit. Lastly the bathroom came with a bath tub, which I felt was a tad too high, making access a little tricky.

The Tv too, was excellent with a wide range of programme options. The breakfast buffet is above average with lots of western and asian options, freshly squeezed juices and excellent varieties of teas and coffee. The room service menu is quite extensive and the food is of a high standard...though a bit pricey! The restaurant (Window on the park) also serves better than average fare at rates marginally lower than room-service.

We had Exec Lounge access; this is quite nice - but no better than any other similar facility in Sing. Some staff were attentive and some really couldn't be bothered. Nothing to wax lyrical about. Bottom line is that this is a reasonable hotel property. It is a Holiday Inn and a 4 star property and as long as you can manage a reasonable rate and keep your expectations in line, you'll be okay.

Considering the Crowne PLaza is meant to be a more up market hotel I cant give enough praise to the Holiday Inn in Singapore for its amazing standard of hospitality, service and quality of product. Not to demean the other properties but I'm sure if the GM's of the other two properties were to visit the Holiday Inn they would understand what I am saying. Special praise should be given to the Ladies and Gents who work in the Executive Lounge. I have never in all the hotels I have stayed in for both business and leasure over the last 10 years, have ever witnessed such politness, devotion to the customer and genuine helpfulness.

Breakfast (included daily) was exceptional with a wide variety of choices to cater for everyone. The restaurant staff were attentive and checked often to see if everything was to our satisfaction. As the hotel was fully booked (the start of the Chinese New Year) the hotel staff apologised that they could not offer a later check out than 12 noon. However as our flight home was not until later that evening, we were allowed to store our luggage at the hotel for the day and use the hotel facilities as we pleased. A perfect location- close to restaurants, food halls, shopping, bars and public transport, we strongly recommend this hotel as being great value for money and child friendly.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cExceeding 4 star standards\u201d", "Author": "kd2011", "ReviewID": "UR94250457", "Content": "We checked in to this refurbished hotel, never expecting that we would enjoy the hotel & its services.

The only glitch I had about this whole experience was about booking. I had booked a few weeks prior to our arrival on their special weekend rate and was disappointed to see a slightly lower rate for the same room a week before our arrival. I called the hotline which then gave me the number directly to the hotel in Singapore so that I may have the rate adjusted. I called them and they said that since I booked it on that rate I couldn't have it adjusted. This kind of irritated me as I am a priority club member and thought they should have been more accommodating on this as other hotel chains who have lowest booking guarantee on their sites usually honor a cheaper rate when it turns up. I would stay in this hotel again if I find a good rate. I would not however give it such an excitedly awesome review as others have.

Then even (without asking) put us in rooms next to each other. Free bottled water in the rooms every day, thank you. The mini-bar filled the little fridge and I had them remove everything at once (needed space for fruit, a few groceries, chilling water). Awesome water pressure in the shower. Two heads (one up top, one hand held). I had to remove the metal stopper to get it to drain quickly, but no real issue with that. Enough hangers to iron almost two week\u2019s worth of shirts/pants and hang up. A \"real\" iron and ironing board, not that mini board you have to sit on the bed. TV had HBO and a fox equivalent, but about on par with other international hotels. Zee TV is always a hoot to watch for this westerner. I had a few problems (internet jack didn't work, alarm from a neighbors room going off, power went out in my room (fuse I think), but each item was handled quickly. They actually sent up a staffer with a laptop to troubleshoot the connection and he actually knew what he was doing (I'm also in IT). This was late at night also, so I was very pleased I didn't get them \"We'll leave a note for the staff tomorrow\" kind of response. Internet was not free, but I am a member of one of their partner providers, so I didn't have to pay. Room service was reasonable, but breakfast at the hotel restaurant was a bit pricey. They had a bit of everything though, from typical western bacon and eggs, to Japanese, Indian and local dishes. Very impressed with the variety. Two little secrets. Eat breakfast at the place around the back near Starbucks. A la carte menu where everything was $1. 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, two pancakes, glass of juice, each for $1. For less then a third of what it costs at the hotel (though not as ritzy of course), you can eat pretty good. (see the picture...that plate/juice was $7SGD.) Also, go to \"Laundry Day\" at the Cuppage mall behind the hotel to get your clothes cleaned. Not sure if they do dry cleaning, but for what the hotel would have charged me around $170 to clean, they did it for $22. Wash-Dry-Fold...almost two weeks of clothes. Other than opening my room door, I almost never touched another door during my stay. Someone was always there to open both the hotel and taxi door. I was told that tipping is not really expected in Singapore, but after a few days at the hotel, I'd say they are OK with it. Nothing big, but I did notice someone tip the concierge and he didn't seem to mind...you know, that closed-palm handoff where you barely see the denomination? Would make a Manhattan door-man proud. So I tipped a bit for a few things including maid service. Most restaurants, though, didn't give you a chance on the credit card slip and I didn't see anyone else around doing it. Staff was very friendly and was eager to help out in any way. Weekend maid service was a bit too eager. One Sunday, even though I had the do not disturb button pushed, they knocked twice and even called later in the evening to see if I wanted to the room cleaned, turn down service and to check to see if the room was cleaned to my liking. I was OK with that, but I'd rather sleep through the interruption. Location off Orchard Road was great. Plenty of shops, restaurants, and a tour guide place (sponsored by the city, I think) within a few blocks. You can pay as much as you want for the high end restaurants, but can get a lot of the same items at the various hawker shops scattered everywhere. A foodie\u2019s dream.

I asked for another room that would be quieter, and they gave us a room on the 3rd floor, on the \"quieter\" side of the hotel. However, the other side also faces a road, and there was an open air restaurant (open late) about 70 meters from our room. In addition, a large group of men seemed to congregate nightly on the street just outside our room, talking loudly until nearly midnight. All of this, in addition to the screaming drunk guys in the room next to us, playing cards/shouting until 3 in the morning ------ well, it did not make the best impression. Other problems? 1. The hot tub did not look like it had been cleaned in ages, with little brown bits floating everywhere. 2. The pool for children is extremely slippery and very unsafe if children are not very carefully monitored. My daughter (4 years old) lost her balance and could not regain it, because she kept slipping, but luckily I was right there to help her. On the positive side, as others have mentioned, the staff are fine, and the rooms are fine. The breakfast if fine as well, though they close things down precisely at the end of breakfast, in a kind of frenzy. So, overall, a very, very average experience. Granted, the noise issues are a result of a poor location. But, there were a number of others small things that added up over three days, contributing to the overall \"average\" experience.

It was central to where we wanted to be, short walking distance to variety of eateries, and short taxi ride to major sights. For 4 adults, a taxi trip is the way to go. The bus station is also just a block away on Orchard Row. We stayed here a total of 4 nights, before & after cruising on RCCL, week of Jan. 13th. The cruise boat arrived early morning back to Singapore, and we were able to check in because the room was ready. We stayed in the double-bed rooms, 4 adults can fit here comfortably well, nothing tight at all about movement. It was very difficult finding a family room that could accommodate 4, and I was pleasantly surprised when we got to our rooms. Chinatown, Little India, Sentosa island, Merlion park, National Botanical Gardens and Orchidarium, and Orchard Row were our targets. Night Safari was a so-so, because it was too dark to see the animals, althou a lot cooler to venture out in the evenings. I had more fun enjoying the Fire-Eaters show. The Waterworld Aquarium on Sentosa island was a hit for kids cause they allow you to feed the sharks & stingrays, but for a fee. The Images of Singapore on Sentosa island had a good museum of city history, and was cool air-con bldg. to hide from the heat. Having an elderly, with a walker/wheelchair in tow, kept our pace slow but nothing was difficult in handling the city terrain. The hawker markets were fun meal-time adventures.

We chose this hotel mainly on the fact that it had been upgraded recently and the location of the hotel is good. The lobby area is smaller than I expected but welcoming all the same, with a bar area and plenty of nice seating all around. Check in quick and polite but not friendly with no other info on the hotel other than where the lift was. We were however upgraded to a junior suite and given a welcome drink voucher to have in the bar. The room on the 5th was a nice size, I like the new Holiday Inn colours of teal and brown done in a contemporary style with dark wood. A sofa and a large footrest/coffee table and lamp tables in the sitting area with a good sized work desk and chair. A flat screen TV/DVD on the wall which was on a bracket to face the bed or sitting area. A wardrobe which contained the safe and plenty hanging space and draws, but only one pair slippers and one robe. In this small area the mini bar and tea/coffee making facilities. Like the fact that the fridge was a one in which you could take out everything and use it for your own things. 2 bottles of water were complementary also. A full sized hairdryer was in the draw. The bathroom was on the small side but there was plenty of space to place your own things around the sink. Again nicely refurbished and good quality towels, which makes a change! The real problem I found with the bathroom was that whilst the shower is over the bath, which is not usually a problem however as the shower screen is fixed it makes it quite difficult and IMO if you have any mobility problems you would struggle to get in and out of the bath. Really awful shampoo/conditioner and body wash, cheap and nasty. The bed was nice and firm with a good quilt and a choice of hard or soft pillows. Linen very good as well. However we did have a couple of problems. The air-con was broken and the temp in the room was 27dg even though it was switched on. After reporting an engineer came within 5 mins and changed a part and it was working within 20 mins, an inconvenience but was dealt with straight away. The other problem we had, and the staff are aware of it is the noise from a nearby club. A thumping bass greeted us when we arrived back into the room at 11.45pm. It was so loud I thought we were above a nightclub. Rang reception, asked if this would go on for long, the staff as I say know about the problem and apparently the police had been notified to get the club to turn down the music, it did for a while but woke us up just before 3.00am as it had been turned up again. We had been offered another room moving during the night, but we decided to move the next day. Next day without any fuss another room was ready for us, re-packed and our luggage was moved. Again a Junior Suite, different shape, I preferred this one, extra chair a better laid out room, but with the same problem in the bathroom with the fixed screen. the air-con worked fine. No noise that night and slept well, oh and there was a turn-down service, but no paper that morning but a paper the day before, a little inconsistent. Did not have any food in the hotel too many eating places all around but the Indian Restaurant in the hotel did look very swish. The pool area, which we did intend to use but ran out of time, was very nice with lots of chairs/loungers to choose from and plenty in the shade. All in all we did enjoy our stay, mainly due to the refurbishment and everything being new and fresh, however be warned about the music which really should be dealt with. But our complaint was handled well by staff to change rooms, but just a shame it\u2019s a problem.

Can't comment on the food in the hotel as we ate out all the time, although the children managed to try most of the mocktails on the cocktail menu, all of which were thoroughly enjoyed! The only slight issue was that our room overlooked a nightclub (more likely a lap dancing club given the attire of the ladies outside touting for business!!) and on a few occassions the music went on all night (despite strict laws against this). However we were so exhausted that this didn't phase us, however if it bothers you just call reception and security will report the club.

After experiencing the level of service and facilities, I am confident that I simply could not have made a better choice. From the moment the front door staff ever-so carefully assisted him out of the taxi (and into a wheelchair they provided), I knew he was in good hands! The front desk team was genuinely friendly, fast, organized and very proactive- and they checked in on him regularly after I left out of their own concern. The spacious rooms were perfectly equipped for a room-bound guest: the TV, DVD player and Internet access kept him entertained and occupied, and the dreamy bed and accessible bathroom made sure he was kept comfortable and safe. The room staff kept the room spotless, and the clean shirts and extra pillows were very appreciated. His mobility was limited, but he still needed to take a break from being in the room, so having the Club lounge close-by was the biggest bonus. ...again- pls let me go on about the staff! I am so personally grateful for the care they took to assist him with the breakfast buffet and the evening cocktails. Top notch! While I cannot comment on the other facilities, I am sure they are up to scrutiny, and the reported construction was of absolutely no disturbance to us. The location, just off Orchard, is perfect . A <5min walk yielded all I could need to load him up with extras before I left- and do a bit of personal shopping.

I am Priority Club Platinum yet the front desk person tried to get me to pay extra for an \"upgraded\" room even though I should have receieved it on a complementary basis. After going back and forth, I finally was offered an \"upgrade\" which only meant the room had a newer look with white duvets and marble bath, but not an executive level room. Oh well... Location is great, just off Orchard Road with the Cuppage Center open air restaurant row just out the front door. Metro station a 5 minute walk. Best part was the lobby lounge.

We were shown to our room on the fourth floor and the noise was unbearable, we immediately requested to be moved. No problem, we were then re-elocated to the seventh floor, this was slightly better but the noise got increasingly worse between 9.30am - 5.30pm so we stayed out of the hotel until that time. Apart from that we had no problems with the hotel, the extra cost involved in the upgrade to the Executive floor was well worth the S$60 (Approx \u00a323) per room per night. Complimentary full english/ continental breakfast, internet access. Complimentary evening drinks, beer, wine, cocktails and light buffet was also served between 6.00pm to 8.00pm every evening. Considering a continental breakfast alone in the hotel cost S$20 (Approx \u00a38.00) per person the cost of the upgrade was money well spent. The rooms were of a good size, beds were very comfortable, nice clean linen and ample good quality towels in the bathroom. Located just off Orchard Road its perfectly placed for the shops. The nearest MRT station is Somerset which is about a 5 minute walk away. This has to be the best transport for getting aroung Singapore and inexpensive if you purchase an EZ link card. The MRT System is very similar to the London underground system, and all signs and announcements are in English. Once in your room there are letters informing you of the times and dates of the work being carried out, (a little late when you've already booked in) the first of four phases of work is being carried out 2nd July to 2nd August 2008 between 10am - 6pm Monday to Saturday. Beyond those dates I suggest you contact the hotel directly. The exterior of the hotel is also being cleaned between 23rd June to 15th August, this doesn't create any problems as they are only pressure washing the walls and windows.

(2 adults, 2 children (3 + 6) and our baby who was just 1 before we went). We had booked to stopover there on the way to Oz and the way back (proved to be good move!) Before we left the UK, the hotel had responded very well to emails I had sent them. They answered all our questions and were able to satisfy an earlier checkin time (after a long flight!) and a cot in our room. Even though we were unable to book 2 adults, 2 children + baby on the website (could only say 2 adults) the hotel confirmed that a Deluxe Double room would satisfy our requirement... and they were right. We arrived very early, about 8am local time.. after a 12 hour flight all we wanted was a nice bath and bed, especially the younger members of the party! Though the hotel could not promise us a room on arrive (norm. checkin is 2pm), when I had emailed them before our arrival, they did say that they would free a room asap. They did exactly that, we wait for about an hour and we were very happy with that! The hotel is in walking distance (2-3 mins) of the main shopping/east street Orchard Road and the large Centre Point shopping Mall. We were able to grab some breakfast at McDonalds (Not our normal eating establishment!! but was the only thing open that early) before heading back for a lovely sleep! The hotel staff were excellent, from the moment we arrived (baggage, checkin, room service etc) they all made a fuss of the children but were very pleased to help. The staff attending your room (baggage, room service etc. do hang around expecting tips, but then that\u2019s normal for a large hotel of this kind. The room was as we expected large enough for 2 double beds and a cot, plus 3 large suitcases and hand luggage. It sometimes felt cramp but then there was 5 of us in the room as well as all the baggage! It was nice and cool, the A/C was actually quite good and easy to use. Both times we had a fairly nice view of lots of greenery across a busy road and the girls enjoyed watching the different cars go past (yes, they thought that was great!) The room was very clean and maybe it could of done with fresher decor but it was still fine. The TV comes with a number of channels (2/3 kids channels thank goodness!) and tea/coffee. We had room service for the children a couple of times (pizza, chicken nuggets/fish and chips) which we thought was very good quality and good value for money. (surprising for a hotel) Quite large portions too. The Swimming poor is excellent, again especially for children. A small pool for little children and then a large very suitable poor for the rest! It's very clean though goes deep suddenly. so watch out! Also is a little slippy so no running! (as we found ourselves saying!) It's open early in the morning until 11pm.. nice after a late checkin (like on our return trip) and the lights make the pool look lovely. There are plenty of comfortable sun beds around the pool, including some in the shade. Only down side was that its not easy to order pool side food/drinks... plenty of menus.. no one to take orders! We just took drinks/snacks with us that we had purchased locally (at half the price!) Worth pointing out that as well as the pools, there are saunas, Jacuzzi, showers, nice Gym (with all the mod cons) and of course nice clean large towels! Breakfast is well worth having, lots of choice for the all (cereals, toast, eggs, meat.. you name it they have it) Worth also mentioning that kids don't pay for breakfast.. just the adults. For a large hotel it still felt personable... t was Mothers Day whilst we were there and after arriving back from Singapore Zoo (a real must!) there was a knock on the door.. it was a couple of very smartly dressed hotel staff (maybe even the manager.. don't know) with a large chocolate cake and some small cream cakes for the mum! It was a lovely surprise and very welcome.... shame mum does not like cakes! (but the kids and I did enjoy them!) To summarise... large hotel that caters for both business and leisure visitors (fine for both), very comfortable, even luxury. Great for kids (with nice meals that they will eat, pool and TV!) and nice fab for parents and pushchairs! 20 mins from the airport...

The Hotel is great for walking along Orchard Road. A tip - walk out towards Tanglin in the morning before it gets too warm (shops open at 10 am), and then start shopping (or rather walking) back towards the hotel, which is behind Robinsons Centrepoint. Check out the pool on the 8th floor. Checking in was a breeze too - and very friendly staff. The only constructive remark I have is the number of housekeepers who cannot speak good English.
