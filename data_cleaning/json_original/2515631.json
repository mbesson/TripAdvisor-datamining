The property itself seems to be well kept, modern, and clean. Our room was spacious, the beds were comfortable, and we had a nice view of the cityscape on the 12th floor. I also enjoyed spending some time on the rooftop socializing with other conference goers. The room rate seemed very reasonable relative to the hotel location and overall amenities offered. My only \"gripe\" really would be the $10/night fee for in room wifi. Of course something like this is only a minor inconvenience for me and would most likely never be a deal breaker.

The are quite a few good points to this hotel. Location is excellent, right at the end of the gaslamp area and opposite the ballpark and the convention centre, the hotel bar on the top floor is amazing, a view of the ball park included. The downstairs bar has great staff and a good selection of food. The rooms are nice, big, clean, TV is updated, although at far too low an angle. Unfortunately a few issues drove me crazy while staying here. First off, 9.30am room cleaning? Really? I was woken up on my first morning (after my 14 hour tip) by housekeeping coming in to clean the room. I learned to keep my do not disturb tag outside my room at night. Unfortunately, their seemed to be a window of opportunity, as one morning where I left at 10.30am and returned at 2pm, I found the room wasn't made up at all. Oh well. The proximity of my room to the elevators was also an issue, I can deal with the odd loud guest coming in and out, but I could hear the beeping of the elevator every time it stopped, and in the mornings, this happened a lot. To compound this, there seemed to be some plumbing issue in the rooms too and the drains would start making a loud gurgling noise randomly, when not in use. I didn't really get a good nights sleep there and I probably should have asked to be moved, but busy at a conference and constantly tired, I didn't have the energy, frankly, the staff should identify and block these rooms. I liked the hotel for so many reasons, but I would probably pick another nearby hotel were I to return to San Diego.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for conference center, baseball park\u201d", "Author": "Martin P", "ReviewID": "UR128625875", "Content": "I was here for a conference and the location and quality/ value of the hotel is perfect.

The room itself was nothing fantastic, but suitable for our last night in San Diego. The location gave us an opportunity to check out the Gaslamp Quarter and the waterfront between the convention center and the USS Midway museum. So as far as location is concerned, not bad at all. We arranged a breakfast special which included a buffet breakfast as part of the room charge, which was perfect for us. The hotel has a well known roof-top outdoor bar, but we didn't have time to check it out. The business center was available for airline web check-in, so we were able to book our seats and print our boarding passes. Wireless internet was not included in the room price, which for me is a huge disappointment.

We stayed at the Marriott in the Gaslamp and have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. You really can't beat the location. It is 2 miles to the San Diego Zoo, 5 miles to Sea World, and Petco park is adjacent to the hotel. There are tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The Altitude bar on the top of the hotel is great! We could only go up during the day because we had the kids with us, but it overlooks Petco Park so you can watch the game from there. You can also look into the park from the concierge lounge. We were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the concierge floor. I am not sure why we were upgraded other than that my husband is a silver (or maybe gold, not sure) Marriott rewards member, but it was a very nice perk. We got free continental breakfasts and h'ordeuvres, free Wifi, and there was a computer and printer in the lounge that came in handy for printing our tickets for our activities. If you are lucky enough to be upgraded, be sure to get a to go container for your breakfast and you can take it up to the Altitude Sky Lounge and eat your breakfast outside. The room was very nice and clean. The kids loved that the turn down service included rock candy and Oreo cookies each day. I am not sure if this is a perk of being upgraded or if they do this for everyone, but the kids loved it! They also had bowls of candy in the lobby. The only drawback to the room was that there was no refrigerator. The hallway carpets were a little on the dingy side, but other than that I was completely happy with the hotel (and I am a high maintenance kind of girl). The staff was super friendly! Everyone we met from the maid to the valet guys were super friendly and helpful. Outstanding service. If you get a chance to go to a Padres game, I highly recommend it. We're not Padre fans, but it was still fun and the tickets are so cheap that we were able to sit in the 8th row. The kids got to meet some of the players and they will sign autographs. The best part was that it's right next to the hotel so there was not fighting traffic. We also went to Heavenly Cupcake for my son's birthday which is just a few blocks from the hotel. They were really good, but a bit pricey. We ate a Bud's one evening and recommend it. If you are on Foursquare you can check in and get free tater tots. There isn't a kids menu, but they did have chicken tenders and sliders and what kid doesn't love tater tots? My husband also recommends the Strip Club which which is a restaurant where you pick out your own steaks and cook the steaks on a grill. We did not do this on this trip, but he was there a few months ago and said it was neat experience and the food was good. We also found a great breakfast/brunch place called Mary Janes. We loved it. I had a great breakfast burrito and the kids enjoyed the bottomless bowl of cereal and Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes.

The lobby was magnificent and the rooms superb - especially our view of PetCo park, a special treat to see so close from that angle, day and night.

Room service appears to be a selection from the menu of the restaurant downstairs - Soleil@K (which we had visited on one night of our stay). The chicken we ordered was delicious, absolutely faultless. The one problem we had concerned check in. When we arrived, at approx 3:30pm (30 minutes before regular check in) we were told our room had not been prepared (perfectly acceptable, of course) and they would let us know when it was ready. Unfortunately once 4pm rolled around, we were not contacted by staff (as promised) and waited longer than necessary before returning to the desk ourselves and asking what the status of the room was - the room was ready, of course - it was past 4pm! Something unusual for a chain hotel, the shower head in the bathroom was fantastic, nothing like any of the usual sort you would expect. Check out via the in-room service was quick and easy, though the instructions laid out on the paperwork left at our door was outdated and possibly misleading to those not so technologically literate. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting PetCo park, the Gaslamp Quarter, SDCC, The Broken Yolk Cafe (as seen on Man V Food!

We loved the location, but there are several reasons we'll stay elsewhere next time. First the good: * Location - Only 1 block From the southern end of the 5th street Gaslamp district. Loads of restaurants & bars nearby and within walking distance of Balboa park (a bit of a walk, so likely not good for small children or older folk). * Cleanliness - Very clean & reliable maid svc. * Toffee - Big ol' bowl at reception that my gf couldn't get enough of. * French Toast - Mighty tasty French toast that comes w/ an otherwise average bfast buffet. However, skip the buffet unless it is included w/ your room rate. You can find much better for the $18 they otherwise charge. * View - We had a 17th floor room that had a decent view of the water and the unexpected fireworks on Fri, Sat & Sun nights. However, if on a lower floor, your view is likely to be of the neighboring building's windows (i.e. keep your drapes closed). Now for the bad: * Mattress - It was one of the oldest, most uncomfortable ones I've slept on. The mattress & springs were ancient & they simply tried to improve it w/ a 1\" think mattress pad. Needless to say, it didn't work & made the bed not only too soft, but also lumpy. * Toilet - Mot only was the bathroom quite small, but the toilet flush was extrely loud - both from within the room and from neighboring rooms (both on the same floor & above). Both my gf & I were awoken several times by it. There is absolutely no way to sleep through it, especially if your partner needs to use it in the middle of the night. * Age - While marriott does a good job of keeping it updated, it is getting older. From the tiny bathrooms to the thin walls, the infrastructure can't be changed. * Valet - Luckily parking was included, otherwise it would've been something like $34/night. Plus, they left my car door ajar for 2+ nights such that my battery was completely dead, required a jump to leave (which took 45+ minutes), and had to be replaced when I returned to LA. Not reasonable for a battery/car that is less than 2.5 yes old. * Management - My gf and I were a little bored & wanted to leave a day early to spend a night in Temecula. I'm a Mariott Elite who spends 30-40 nights a year in Mariott hotels. When I asked if it would be a problem tocheck out a night early, the day manager went into contract mode and stated the hotel's non-negotiable $150 early departure fee. When I simply asked if there was any way this could be waived for a good customer, she pulled out my signature on the reservation form, pointed to the fine print and said \"see you signed in agreement of this fee when you checked in\". I was taken aback as I was not being the least bit argumentative and ws simply asking if there was leeway. She couldn't care less and was quite rude. Amyway, the hotel is decent, but there are MANY, MANY, MANY (did I say many?) more options in the area. I'll most definitely try another (non-Mariott property) next time.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kamloops, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMarriott Gaslamp...great location, lots of walking!\u201d", "Author": "JForster154932", "ReviewID": "UR114945895", "Content": "the Marriott is nice and rooms are large, ask for ocean and \"Petco\" view, on the even side.

Unfortunately, the Padres were away for the weekend. The room was comfortable but nothing to brag about (the bathroom in particular was pretty small). The bed was too soft for my taste. Our reservation included the breakfast buffet, which was excellent, as was the service. We also ate dinner there on our last evening (a Sunday) when the restaurant was dead. There was only one other party seated at the same time. The Gaslamp is one of San Diego's hip areas but it is not for everyone. Plenty of restaurants and bars, which is both a plus and a minus. There are tons of options but there were a lot of drunk people as well as pretty aggressive homeless people around. I never felt unsafe but some people may be very uncomfortable staying in this part of town. I had combined a stay at the Marriott with one at the Del Coronado across the Coronado bridge.

There is an excellent restaurant just around the corner; we ate at the Broken Yolk every morning. Upon arrival, you are greeted by friendly doormen eager to assist with your luggage. Check-in was simply and sweetened with saltwater taffy in the huge bowls on the main desk. Our first room was a standard room with two double beds but on our second stay we asked for the largest room in our category and were given a corner room with a large office alcove suitable for a cot. The hotel was clean and well decorated. The beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet. There was only a standard TV in the room....a flat screen would have improved the look. An in-room safe was handy and we used this to store our passports and foreign currency. Every morning before 8am you can grab coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the lobby. There are no laundry facilities in the hotel. There is a fabulous night club on the roof that gives you a great view of Petco Park and the harbour. If you are going to a ball game, this is the hotel to stay at as you are steps away from the game. If you need to rent a car, you will have to go to the Omni, one block over to make arrangements. The hotel is in the heart of the Gaslamp area so if you are looking for great food and night time entertainment this is the place to be. Life in this district really gets going after 9pm. Even so, this hotel is extremely quiet and we never heard noise from the night club on the roof or the restaurants below.

Be prepared to pay a little bit more than the average but it's so worth it. Dicks Last Resort.....what can I say.....I've never been so comfortable with being verbally abused!! It was fantastic fun.

There is no pool here, so I wouldn't recommend it for families looking for a lot of recreation for the kids, but for those who love night life, or business travelers, or first time visiters to San Diego, this is a great place to say. The average rate seems to be about $200 per night and some people have mentioned it's expensive. It's certainly not a budget hotel, but I think it's an excellent value when you consider the quality of the hotel, the location, the style, the comfort, and the service.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay as always\u201d", "Author": "RenNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR58590473", "Content": "Just returned from a business trip and stayed at the Marriott Gaslamp Quarter for the 4th time.

(there is only one city bus route that serves the airport) The MTS bus stop is located under the escalators that lead to the sky bridge. Do NOT take the sky bridge to \u201cground transportation\u201d, instead walk under these escalators and proceed outside. There is a clearly marked rectangular sign post with \u201cMTS\u201d written on it. There is a schedule on the pole and information regarding the bus fare. The fare is $2.25 exact change (bills or coins). The bus took approximately 8 minutes to get to downtown. Get off the bus at the stop located at 4th and Broadway. (It is the LAST stop on the route and thus not hard to locate, it is located beside Horton Plaza). Walk down 4th street for approximately 10 minutes to \u201cK street\u201d. Turn left. The hotel is on the left side at number 660. Check-in was quick, less than 5 minutes. The room key is required to access the elevators. No more than a 15-30 second wait for the elevators both in the evening and the following morning. My room, 1726, was located at the far end of the hallway. The room was attractive, comfortable and impressive. The bathroom had a sliding, wood door that does not lock. Standard bath tub and shower with lots of water pressure. The bath products were quite nice and well supplied with a few extras. There is a coffee maker with stainless steel pot and Starbucks coffee products. The unit made a nice, hot, cup of coffee in the morning. Both paper cups and black, ceramic mugs were provided. No issues with cleanliness. The room had one king bed, a wardrobe that contained drawers and the T.V., a cupboard, wing chair, and large corner unit work desk with rolling chair. The windows both opened onto the street, that was relatively quiet. The view was of downtown, the convention center and the ocean in the far distance. The 17th floor allowed views over most of the surrounding buildings so that quite a grand vista was afforded. The bed was comfortable with several types of pillows and a duvet that was very warm without being too hot. The alarm clock was a bit difficult to figure out, but there are helpful instructions on a sticker on the front of the clock. The button on the telephone that was supposed to connect to \u201cwake up calls\u2019 actually always connected to the hotel\u2019s messaging service and needs to be reprogrammed. The carpet was clean, the furnishing in excellent condition and the room very well maintained. Any staff I had contact with were friendly and helpful. The common areas of the hotel were modern and attractive. Bowls of salt water taffy were placed on the front desk for guests to help themselves to. The hotel is directly beside Petco Park, and across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. The hotel is located in the Gas Lamp Historic Quarter, but more to the edges. A street or two over are where most of the restaurants, pubs and clubs are located. The light rail line (ORANGE) is within easy walking distance (3-5 minutes) as is the convention center.

A couple of comments. The hotel has been remodeled so it has all the right touches--gym, computer room and well decorated rooms. The staff are also well trained and very eager to please. The restaurant was nice and the adjecent bar full of sports fans getting ready for a Padres game. The rooftop bar was very nice and had an excellent view of the stadium. Overall this is an excellent urban property with all the amenities. However the check-in clerk was not familiar with using state-issued credit cards for business travel. My work issued credit card has a $1,000 per day limit but the cost of my hotel for my entire stay was $1,200.00. The clerk ran my card through the machine several times and it was declined because she charged the entire stay which was over the daily limit. I had to use my personal card to check-in and someone from our accounting office called me thinking I was trying to charge personal items over the daily limit on a state card. When I went to the front desk to ask her to clarify the issue another customer was trying to check-in and had the same problem! A couple of points worth mentioning. I arrived late a night after flying in from Miami. Having spent the entire day on the plane meant I wanted to use the gym to work the kinks out of my back. The rooftop bar turns into a late-night hot spot. To access the gym at night means you have to walk through the night-time party crowd so you are walking through groups of clubbers smoking and drinking. That was interesting. Early in the morning when most people used the gym it was not an issue. In fact the gym was a great place to workout and the staff left beverages and fruit in the morning. But just be prepared for the night crowd. Also, I was on EST time the entire trip which meant the Padres game started at the same time as my normal bed time. The ballpark is next door to the hotel and it is very loud. The hotel provides noise machines which drowns out the roar of the crowd. I ordered room service that night and have to admit that the hand made guacamole was very good and better than some I had in Old Towne or the Gaslamp QUarter.

Obviously, the location cannot be beat. It's adjacent to the Gaslamp District and Petco Park (home of the San Diego Padres), putting you in the center of downtown San Diego's attractions. There is no need to have a car as downtown attractions are all within in walking distance and many others are a short ride on the San Diego Trolley. I was staying in town for a wedding and photographs were at 2pm, the hotel without hesitation granted me an 11am check-in so I'd have time to shower and change after the drive from Los Angeles. My Marriott elite status was recognized at check-in and I was given a room on the 20th floor and access to the Concierge lounge without having to ask. My room directly overlooked the entire playing field at Petco. The room as good-sized for a downtown hotel and furnished with a nice modern flair. Now what really set this property apart were the small touches. For some these things may not matter, but for someone who travels as often as I do, they are invaluable. Mouthwash was provided in the bathroom along with a sealed loofa for use in the shower with liquid shower gel (I am not a fan of soap bars). There were also two complimentary bottles of water sitting next to the ice bucket for me. Each staff member I encuontered was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working at this Marriott. As an added bonus, one of the hottest bars in San Diego, Altitude, is located rooftop on the 22rd floor. Lines to gain access extended throughout the entire lobby nightly, but as a guest, you bybass the line and can go straight up to the rooftop.

From the second we checked in, to the time we checked out, their service was outstanding! We were upgraded to a room on a higher floor as we had a full on view of Petco Park and was also offered complimentary breakfast from the website we booked from. Gosh, was our view awesome!! My friends and I were running late for a reservation we had so upon arriving, we only had time to check in and put our luggages in the room. However, we did not want to valet for we were afraid of being even more late. Valet was so kind enough to allow us to just park our car in the front until we headed out again. When we came back, the staff was so attentive that they even asked if we had plans for the night for they had some advise on where to go and what to do. Really kind of them! Our room was immaculate and spacious! Very clean and enough room for 3 girls to get ready in! I loved the contemporary furniture and most of all the BEDS! I've stayed in hotels that had REALLY good comfortable beds, but this Marriott by far was the BEST! The hotel is very centalized around everything in downtown. Easy to walk around and find almost everything! The only thing was when we came back to our hotel, the Padres were playing and heavy traffic was everywhere. We were in no hurry that time, so we didn't mind it at all. They have an awesome lounge area on the rooftop called Latitude. It was nice that we stayed there for we didn't have to wait in a line that wrapped around the corner. The lounge uon the rooftop isn't your typical club as it is more loungey and tasteful. The view again from up there was beautiful! Even at night! It was just nice to listen to some good music, have some drinks, and talk with your girlfriends without so much running and bumping into a crowd of people.

The king sized bed was incredibly comfortable. The room was very clean. As a bonus, there was a huge bowl of chocolate kisses at the front desk that is never empty for the hotel guests. There are actually 3 candy bowls, but I only cared about the chocolate. The roof top of the hotel is the bar that has a perfect view of the ball field. On a chilly night, you can sit next to the fire pit , order a glass of wine from the bar and a plate of cheese from the kitchen. It doesn't get any better than that! I can't remember the young bartenders name but he was exceptionally nice. When I told him I was on my own that night, he bought me a glass of wine. I loved the roof top experience. It's a great way to unwind after working all day. Staying at the Gaslamp Marriot made my stay more of an adventure. It was so easy to get around. I never felt unsafe which made exploring the area even more enjoyable. There is also a free computer to use on the 6th floor. Everyone at the Gaslamp was friendy and very helpful. Later in the week, I moved to another hotel (not the Marriot) to another location downtown. Downtown has a completely different feel to it. Sadly there are many homeless people downtown.

If you're here for a convention at the convention center, it's a short and pleasant walk. Beyond that, the hotel has its good and bad points. First, the good points: this hotel is at the edge of the Gaslamp district. There are endless restaurants, bars, shopping, or whatever touristy diversion you could want. Second, there's Colleen (hope I remember that right) at the front desk. If you have a problem, she'll fix it. It's also a very quiet hotel unless you have noisy neighbors like I did on 1 of 3 nights. Unlike the Hyatt, you'll never hear the trolley because it doesn't run next to the hotel and that's a good thing unless you plan on using it. There's a coffee maker, a hair dryer, and all of the usual toiletries. Hot water came up pretty fast except on the day when I got up at 4AM to catch an early flight. Then it took a few minutes for the shower to get up to temperature. Not everything was perfect and I found more problems than I would have expected in a hotel that's so highly rated here. First, realize that all of the hotel's rooms were not created equal. The first room they gave me was on the 9th floor. It looked like a basement apartment because the windows started halfway up the wall, and the glass was frosted so you couldn't see out of the room. Fortunately the windows opened far enough for me to see what they were hiding and it was a roof with some kind of equipment on it. Maybe they weren't noisy air conditioning compressors that I saw, but I didn't want to find out. I went back to the lobby and got switched to room 1701 with a view of Petco park that was just like the ones in the traveler photos here. Another problem is that you can't get to your room without using your key card in the elevator to allow access to the guest floors. It's a nice security feature but when you get into the elevator with both hands full of luggage, it's a bit silly. There's a bar on the roof that's open to the public and at night they block off one of the four elevators for roof access only. There's always a crowd in the way, the three other elevators become busier and slower than ever, etc. And this is when it's not baseball season. The roof bar looks down on the stadium so during a game this elevator situation can't be fun for guests in the lobby. I think the roof bar is probably a good reason to avoid staying on the top floor, but that's just a guess. Finally there's the high speed internet access. First you have to call downstairs. Then you have to tell them if you want wireless or an ethernet connection. After you say \"Wireless\", they tell you that you'll need to give your credit card number to some company that you've never heard of. And if you want to use a cable to connect, the charge can go on your bill. Once you try to use it, you go through a screen that basically says \"Your only choice is 24 hours of broadband. What would you like to choose?\" You have to do this every 24 hours or you can skip a day if you'd like. Upon checkout you'll discover that after you pick the 24 hour \"option\", you get billed for this automatically every day until you check out. One good thing is that along with the internet, you also get free domestic calls, local or long distance. I'm not sure how much people actually use the phone in their room for long distance calls, but it seems like a reasonable way to call home once you realize it's free. The system doesn't seem to be well thought out. I think they'd make more money if the rooms were $3/night more and there was free wifi, but I'm not in the hotel business. I just stay in hotels. Overall, I had a good time at the Marriott.

The room that we got was a HUGE room with a seperate sitting area. We must have gotten upgraded to a suite but it was awesome. Great view of the Petco stadium. Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed. As I mentioned about the employees, I have never met more friendly and helpful Valet Attendants before in my life. One morning prior to leaving the hotel for a run, I asked where I could find a drug store at which time all 3 employees outside provided me with at least 8 different ones within my running path. Can't say enough about the friendly employees. The restaurant in the hotel was wonderful. A bit pricey but not bad at all. The gym was a typical hotel gym with several treadmills, free weights (low weights though), and a couple other machines. The hotel, as many others have written, is at the base of the Gaslamp Quarter District. It is literally on the corner of the district and you only have to walk a couple blocks to get to the end of it so within these few blocks, you have wonderful restaurants and bars. The close proximity would please any age group whether you want to just have an early dinner or stay out and drink all night. You are also directly across the street from Petco Stadium which is awesome. I recommend buying the $5.00 standing room only tickets as we did if you are going to a game. You can see the game from anywhere around the stadium and it lets you get a different aspect from the different spots. If you don't want to go to the game, you can watch it from the rooftop bar which was pretty cool. Rather expensive but a must see. If I return to San Diego, I would only stay here and would tell anyone that is traveling to San Diego to stay here.

We could hear quite a bit of activity whenever people would walk back and forth. The front desk staff were very nice (Kirby was pretty cool). The only issue was that when we arrived at 5pm, there was only one front desk clerk and like 4 or 5 people backed up in line. We waited for about five minutes but then 2 additional front desk staff showed up and we got checked in quickly. But where were those 2 staffers for the first five minutes?

We received a pass to swim at the Marriott Towers nearby on the water, but it was a good 6+ block walk in a swimsuit and that pool was so packed with people you couldn't move.

Their beautiful new stadium sits right next to this hotel, so you can definitely walk over and enjoy all the beer you want before safely returning to your room.

We've done this before and were willing to pay the 28.00 daily rate went up BTW from last years 24.00 no problems though fast and curteous. Check -in - Easy and fast no problems. Room- We had a room facing the building directly across from the Marriott but also had a beautiful view of the water and Petco Park. I guess we were in a premium room that was somewhat larger and most updated to ones on lower levels. We were on the 17 floor (1716) and anything higher than that requires the key for the elevator. The room was bigger than a lower floor we had before and the decor looked to be fairly new . Everything in modern city style the bathroom doors I noticed were pocket doors which helps with not taking up walking space in the entry. I forgot how small the double beds are here, they were comfortable but small. One thing that I had never heard ( I guess because we were on a lower floor last) of was when I called to get a roll- away for my child they said they could not give us one as we are above the 15 floor and roll-aways aren't allowed because of fire codes. That was new to me, but no big deal. My Husband and I ventured upstairs one night for a quick drink at the bar on the roof (Altitude) that I had wanted to visit before. Seems to be a very popular bar down in the Gaslamp. Was very busy with a weird but boisterous group of 40 somethings, young professionals, college age bar hoppers and convention people. The view and ambiance of the bar/club was very nice. I thought the drinks were very average but pricey for what you get. We each had 2 mojitos a piece plus tip and tax $58.00 total. We thought we were in Manhattan for a moment! Worth it there, but not for San Diego. Don't think I'd visit that bar again, once was enough.

I recommend doing so, there are so many restaurants and bars you would be hard pressed not finding something you will like. If anything there are too many to choose from. You are walking distance to the beach and marina area and the trolley is just a block away if you care to travel to the Old town area. The staff and concierge were all very helpful and friendly.

I never visited San Diego before, so input was most appreciated. My first night was at the Laguna Cliffs Marriott in Dana Point and then the following 2 nights at the San Diego Marriott Marina (both of which I will write about on their sites). After staying at the Marriott Marina, I reluctantly moved over to the Gaslamp because the Marina was sold out my last night there. I wasn't reluctant to go there because of anything negative of the GasLamp Marriott, but we SO LOVED...the Marina Marriott that I was worried. First the Positives: The lobby was beautiful, simple but clean and elegant. My room was 1900 which was a corner room which had two huge sliding glass door sized windows (but they weren't sliding glass doors), and they opened on the bottom for fresh air. Around the corner of the room was a whole other area with a HUGE workstation for those of you there for business. Also a nice sitting chair in the corner and the desk chair was cushy too. If someone were working there, the other person sleeping around the corner wouldn't be too disturbed. THE ROOM WAS SPOTLESS. Not one fingerprint, dust ball or window streak. The beds had the new bedding which was really nice, flat screen t.v., nice carpeting, beautiful woodwork, even the bathroom door (which was a really cool sliding door with chrome on the bottom), great toiletries, great coffee pot (chrome with FLAVORED CREAMERS!). Now just a few negatives: Parking was expensive (like all downtown hotels). I believe the parking garage was around $20 dollars a day (valet only), and that's because there is NO PULL IN FOR INCOMING CARS. Just a plain old sidewalk. They did let me park my rental car there for a few minutes to check in and go quickly to my room, but I needed to come down right away and move it or they needed to valet it. The walk to the GasLamp was a few blocks, down Fifth street, but it was raining and those few blocks seemed far in the rain (we had sore feet too), so we took a cab to the waterfront area. Right across the street was CONSTRUCTION that probably would have been really annoying if we had been there a few days and trying to sleep in the morning. A HUGE CRANE was right across the street peering through the window. We had to leave at 4:30 a.m. the next moring for the airport, so that wasn't an issue for us. I would highly recommend this hotel though. The people working there were ALL VERY NICE and the concierge was great. BUT, I was traveling with my 14 yr. old daughter and we much more enjoyed the Marriott Marina on N. Harbor because the VIEWS VIEWS VIEWS from our bayside 19th floor room. Plus, we walked every evening right along the marina to the Seaport Village shops and restaurants. It was a short, safe and beautiful walk. The GasLamp had no pool, so the pool at the other property made it a much more desirable property. The GasLamp is a short hike, for you business travelers, to the Convention Center (not a great walk in heels). The Marina Marriott was RIGHT THERE. So even though the location, parking, non-pool could be an issue, it still is a beautiful hotel. Also, the rooftop bar was closed for renovation, but do to reopen March 31st. Hope that helps!

We also checked out Croce's for live jazz and that was terrific, too. Parking at the Marriott is expensive, so we opted to park in the garage across the street for about half the price the one day we did have a rental car. That leads me to the one problem I had with the Marriott...I noticed on the day of checkout that they had charged me $96 for parking and we had never used their garage.

The rooms are beautiful -- not your usual polyester bedspread...this hotel features Marriott's new bedding (ala the Heavenly Bed at Westin), a beautiful marble walled bathroom and nice view of the bay and Petco Park. The rooftop bar (Skybar) is very popular on the weekends, with a line for non-guests stretching through the lobby to get upstairs. Hotel guests go right up. Especially attractive for the 20 and 30 somethings. Services were all around better than normal -- front desk and restaurant staff were very cheerful and helpful. The only spot on that record was that we'd called for fresh towels Sunday morning and they hadn't arrived 45 minutes later. We finally picked up old ones and used those and called to tell them not to bother. Seemed to be a fluke, however, as the next morning we called and got new towels in less than 5 minutes. The breakfast buffet was your standard fare for a hotel of this caliber...but it was $18 too. Unfortunately, the gaslamp is more geared to dinner and drinking than breakfast...so your breakfast options are limited. There is, however, a nice breakfast spot down K street about 3 or 4 blocks west. As another reviewer noted, there is no pool...kinda strange...but you do have reciprocol privileges at the Marriott at the Convention Center -- friends in our group went there and said it was crowded and not pleasant. I've also stayed there...and had the same feeling about the rooms. The other Marriott is about 5 or 6 blocks? away...but there is no shuttle, so if you want to swim, you have to walk or drive. I agree with the other reviews on the parking situation -- we didn't have a car, but folks in our group did. If there isn't a game at the stadium, parking should be ample in the garage right across the street (contrary to another reviewer, I know that there is parking in the hotel itself -- but I suppose they do use the garage across the street for overflow). Park it yourself across the street and you should save plenty off of the $24 tab. Sounds pricey, but things aren't free in DT San Diego. Workout facilities were also pretty decent. I wasn't especially looking for a pool, and I didn't rent a car, so those issues weren't a big deal to me. Like I said, an all around very good hotel.

A big negative would be if you arrived on the day (within a couple of hours) of a home game because it appeared to me that you would not have direct access to the valet (the police close most of roads in that area) and parking would be a nightmare otherwise.", "Date": "August 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thorold, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA++++++++\u201d", "Author": "tjh17", "ReviewID": "UR3735343", "Content": "After spending one night at another hotel, which once again did not look like the pictures, we decided to search out a new one. We wandered into the Marriott Gaslamp and immediately fell in love. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile and the best possible service you could imagine. The front dest supervisor went out of her way to make us feel at home and the night manager even gave us a tour of the hotel and made sure we were happy with the room before we checked in. The rooms were absolutely gorgeous and the bed was comfortable beyond belief. The bathroom was stunning, with all the amenities of home, including high end tolietries. Everyone was very helpful and always smiling. We felt like royalty! The hotel is in the gaslamp district, with shops and dining within walking distance and our room overlooked the baseball stadium. It is because of this hotel and its wonderful staff that we will definatley seek out Marriott properties in the future. Stay at this hotel, you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "San Diego Marriott Gaslamp Quarter", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d498304-Reviews-San_Diego_Marriott_Gaslamp_Quarter-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$191 - $418*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">660 K Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515631", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c8/5e/6e/san-diego-marriott-gaslamp.jpg"}}
