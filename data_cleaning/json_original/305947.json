After travelling for 17 days in different hotels from Beijing to hong Kong, this is one of the better ones, and a nice way to finish out our family trip. Convenient, friendly, and efficient checkin. We travelled with nine people and were able to fit an extra cot in three standard rooms, and we still had enough room to move around. The only downside is that we were on the 5th floor, and smoking rooms are on floors 3 & 4, so you can pick up some of the smoke in the ventilation. Theres a pool and fitness room on the 17th floor--not fancy, but a nice bonus. Buffet breakfast was convenient, but overpriced $HK 110; with teenagers & young adults it was easier ( and signicantly cheaper ) to grab a Danish & coffee at the in house bakery. Not fancy coffee--just a good cup of Joe. Sip Sip lounge has happy hour from 4-9 and two for one drinks--very convenient. There is a shuttle that leaves every half hour for the local market & mong kok metro station, but it's only a 15 min walk anyhow. Theres even shuttle service to the airport for $HK 110; a taxi might be cheaper depending on how many people you have and how much luggage you packed with you.Tons of bakeries, 7-11,& restaurants along the way, including McD. Teresa's restaurant is three doors down from the hotel; they are very loud & friendly, and they appear to have a lot of foreign patrons, as they have a full set of English menus & single serve plates. There's an HSBC ATM machine next door that's well used to take out extra spending money. I wouldn't have any problems staying here again; after traveling across China, this was one of the safest places I felt I was staying in...lots of staff everywhere. Bonus tip: most places in China and Hong Kong didnt have in room wireless, so pick up a wireless router to plug into the Ethernet cable. We were able to share access across three rooms with 6 iPhones & 3 iPads & everyone was happy keeping in touch with their friends back home, without having to hang out in the lobby for hours. Cheers!

This is one of the best for the price range that we've stayed in. We stayed on the Club floor and the staff were friendly and attentive, much more so than most Hong Kong hotels. We thought it was worth the extra to stay on the club floors. The breakfast on the club floor is more peaceful and relaxed than in the main restaurant downstairs, but the selection is much smaller, so we only ate breakfast on the club floor one morning, the rest of the time we ate downstairs in the main breakfast restaurant and the food selection on offer was really good. The club floor free afternoon nibbles and drinks from 5pm to 7 pm was also much appreciated. The room was clean and quiet, and although the usual bland hotel style, the decor was new looking. The room size was larger than most hotels we've stayed in (except the more luxury Novotel Citygate). The free shuttle bus was very convenient and we used it most days, although the nearest MTR is only 10-15 minutes walk away. That isn't far, but depending on the time of year, the weather in Hong Kong can be not just hot, but extremely humid, so walking can be uncomfortable at times. That's when the shuttle bus is really appreciated. The pool is on the roof and we used this everyday for a swim before setting off for the day. We didn't use the gym, so can't comment on that.

The check in lobby is on the second floor so dragging luggage up there and then to the room is a little annoying. They have a lot of bellhops that almost seem overly eager to help though. The elevators are a little slow but they do go from ground up to the rooms. Mind your step sometimes they don't stop quite level with the floor. The rooms are comfortable, but rather old. Like 1992 old. Carpet was surprisingly clean, but I still used the complimentary slippers. Air conditioning a little under powered but it's enough. They had complimentary water which is nice. The minibar fridge is big enough to cram in other stuff around their mini bar \"amenities\" Bathrooms are clean enough, but also very dated. There's a grille at the bottom of the bathroom door with 1 inch slats so it felt like I was doing my business in the room... Toilet was hard to flush in my room, figured out that if you pump the handle 3 times it works well. Location was not the greatest. About 1.5 km walk to MTR Mong Kok station. Normally not a big deal but when it's 34\u00b0C and 100% humidity its annoying (walk takes about 20 minutes). The proximity to the Mong Kok markets is great. You can shop, then go back and drop stuff off. There are a few busses out front, but unless they go exactly where your destination is, don't bother. The concierge is really good at helping you figure this stuff out. There are a few Metropark hotels in Hong Kong.

It's situated in Kowloon, not far from the ladies market, many malls & eateries. The hotel offers a brilliant (free!) shuttle bus all day that sets off every half hour and stops near Mongkok MTR/Ladies market & Tsim Tsa Tsui. We used this pretty much every night. The entrance lounge to the hotel is wonderful, very comfy and has a bakery, two restaurants & a hotel bar also. The staff all seemed friendly; particularly one staff member 'Mirror' who went above & beyond any expectations we had. She gave us five star treatment, without a doubt. There's also a 7/11 a minute or so away from the hotel which was good for buying things like milk, biscuits, water etc and an ATM just a few doors away. I had a bad reaction to Mosquito bites when I was out there and as a precaution, they changed our room and even upgraded us. It was more than kind and they even made sure I was seen by a GP within half an hour so I could get medication. I was very thankful of their gestures. This meant we experienced both the standard room and the club class room. To be honest, the standard room is probably below the luxury level of UK hotels (a bit outdated, odd vent on the door of the bathroom that you could hear through..), however it's very clean & certainly wouldn't be enough to put me off staying there again. We were happy with the standard of comfort, particularly with the price we got this hotel for. As for the club class, it's bigger & has a nicer finish to it. You also got a bowl of fruit in your room and some nights we were given a chocolate on the pillow. Cute gesture! Both rooms were very quiet. While we didn't try out the rooftop pool, I did take a wander up to it and thought it looked clean & nice to bathe in.

Originally assigned a room on a floor that was not yet renovated (10) which was clean, but showed signs of wear in furniture and carpet and had a musty smell. Our concern was met very efficiently and we were given the option to upgrade to a deluxe room (renovated) on the sixth floor. I did not know the difference when I booked using an online hotel company. The cost is very minimal and the difference is like night and day. So be sure to book on one of the renovated floors, which should be marketed as 'deluxe' I am told. Floors 1-6 and 19 are currently renovated, others to follows. Our room had 1 Queen and 1 single bed. Great bedding with a duvet and lots of extra pillows. Blackout curtains for a good sleep , as well as we did not hear any noise within the hotel or from outside, and I am a very light sleeper. As far as checking in and checking out time frames, well it really depends how many people are requesting the services at the front desk at a certain time, just like any business you que up for. Any time I looked over at the front desk or had reason to speak with one of the staff , there always seemed to be an adequate number of employees on the counter. Your wait time depends on when you show up and what the staff are having to deal with really. Breakfast offered a variety of selection and kept us going until dinner. Although a couple of mornings we chose to eat at a local restaurant , as you exit the hotel it is on the right, Teresa's kitchen. Great ambiance and has western style breakfast at minimal cost, yum. This recommendation came from an earlier posters suggestion and it was a good one! Shuttle left promptly on the half hour and we always managed to get a seat. Although with the humid weather, taxi's being inexpensive and plentiful, we often choose to not opt for the shuttle. We used the octopus card for public transport , a must ,rather than digging out change. Nearest MTR is Mong Kok East Rail line (light blue) 5 min walk or nearest main line Mong Kok (red) is about 15 mins . Pool was nice after a long day, no issues. Hotel restaurant for dinners serving western food, not impressed, it was just so so, but we were tired and just wanted something to eat before going to bed. Again, breakfast is great though! There is more than 1 bakery in the area and have very very yummy items to choose . 7-11 convenience store down the street for water and snacks From previous posters, I was expecting alot of places to eat in the area and felt extremely limited. i would say this was the biggest disappointment with the hotels location. There are local eateries, but not any serving western food, this is perhaps why the information may differ. Large bank Hang Seng across the street, where we used ATM and exchanged money to RMB for a 50HKD service fee for any amount. We had issues with the internet connection in our room . It was promptly dealt with by the IT person. I was offered the hotels internet /computer to use because of the problem ,more than once without an issue. I also had reason to request documents to be printed and I was again offered the hotel's printer to use . Furthermore I had a package delivered to the hotel by DHL and was once again delivered promptly to our room. There was another instance where my son left our door ajar when we went out for the evening. The hotel security left us a note that they noticed this and shut our door !! We had 2 mac books sitting out as well as several other items. Really appreciated this service ! On our last day the kids went swimming and I had wet bathing suits to pack. The laundry dried them for me at no charge. SO ALL I CAN SAY IS THE STAFF BENT OVER BACKWARDS FOR US and made our stay seems like a 5 ***** star hotel all the way !! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL.

The rest of the room was good - the fridge was actually cold, the TV had lots of channels, you could control the air conditioning temperature, and complimentary bottles of water were provided each day. Buffet breakfast was nothing spectacular (especially compared to a 5 star hotel), but still had everything you need - someone to make you an omelette, scrambled eggs, cereal, etc. The only thing missing was hash browns, but they did have potato wedges which was a treat! The location is good - it's in Mong Kok which is where a lot of local markets are and there's a lot of good shopping within walking distance. And if you want to go further afield, the shuttle bus to the harbour is great. And there's a supermarket (Wellcome) literally across the road. All in all, a good deal for a 3 star hotel in Hong Kong.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Maunganui, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cAwful experience\u201d", "Author": "FoodSnob24", "ReviewID": "UR134228938", "Content": "Standard rooms, got what we paid for in that respect, nothing special.

The deal that we got through web based travel agency was very good for a 7 night stay. This was my 26th time in Hong Kong and for our family 9th time. Pro's - Room was modern and clean. - Everything in the room worked as promised. - We stayed on the 6th floor and the noice from the Waterloo road did not disturb us. - Hotel shuttle was quite good, it takes you to Mong kok (Ladies market) and TST every 30 minutes and it's free. - Pool was on the roof and we had plenty of sunshine to enjoy, some issues with order by the poolside (see below). - The gym next to the pool has few basic cardio-vascular exercise machines and Wii, nothing fancy, no free weights and if the gymn has more than 4 people, it will be crowded inside. Con's - The only base in the hotel with wireless access seems to be in the lobby (I dont know about executive floor and lounge), and it was ridicillous to come downstairs during evening hours. On many nights the lobby was rather crowded with people and their phones, iPads, computers etc. reading their emails and making Skype-calls. - Even though the pool is on the roof, lifeguards are very inactive when it comes to the unruly behavior of some families. The pool is small and children (and sometimes adults) were allowed to jump in all over, even though clearly forbidden. It was impossible to swim in the pool or have smaller children in the pool (like we did) when 10-15 year old children were jumping in constantly. - We originally booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children. The hotel tried to charge an extra cost for the children, which we refused. After some harsh negotiations and ultimatums we got a family room with two large beds that was enough for our needs. - Breakfast is certainly not worth the price the hotel is charging. Better luck with Wellcome across the street or the restaurants in the same block. All an all, the hotel deal was decent, our room was modern and clean and pool on the roof was ok.

The 5:30-7:30 snack is ok although not great, you get sandwiches, cakes, sweets, maybe fries, some fried dimsum, and your pick of beer or wine. The lounge is small but there are also just a few users. The breakfast in the lounge tends to be simpler, with about 4 dishes less than the the one on the first floor, which is mostly crowded. However, the service is pretty much below standard, even for club room guests. i mean, nobody helped us with our luggage and when I asked for a room with a bath tub, it took them more than 30 mins to reply that i had to go up to the lounge to get some explanation. the shuttle bus departs on the dot (8:00, 8:15, 8:30, 9:00, etc) and leaves you at the edge of Fa yuen sneaker street at mong kok about 150 meters from the mongkok station and at the side of peninsula hotel in TST through a scenic route along the bayfront. It departs every 15 mins from 8 to 11 i think then every 30 mins thereafter.

We chose this hotel mainly because of its price/good reviews ratio and also because it has a swimming pool...a great asset when catering for families! Check in was speedy but both times we had to request a change of room! First time they gave us a non-smoking room as requested but upon entering it was clear that not all clients abide to the rules...the stench of smoke was sickening!Reception was great to promptly change our room without any fuss. Second time around the room they allocated us only had 2 single beds ( we r a couple with 1 child).The booking was done correctly from us so even if they tried and get away with a rollaway bed i asked to be given what we booked for and we were finally given a much larger room that had 1 double bed and 1 single. Rooms are probably starting to look a bit worn but they are very clean. Air con works but it wasn't really easy to adjust the temperature but considering the heat outside it was just bliss to chill out in there! Breakfast was a feast! They have an amazing buffet full of any sort of food from continental to asian, hot and cold and even an egg cooking station with a chef ready to cook them to your liking right there in front of you...quite an attraction for my young one! The hotel shuttle bus is fantastic for trips to the Ladies Market (which is a 10 mins walk) or down to Tsim Tsa Shui (the waterfront from which you can see the Symphony of Lights free on every night at 8pm). The shuttle runs every 30 mins so you never have to wait long in either direction. The cake shop within the hotel was great for snacks and sugar cravings and according to our daughter they had the nicest doughnuts! (Prices are also very affordable so could be a good alternative for meals) The Sip bar was a bit on the expensive side but nice to be there to relax after a busy day sightseeing and shopping! ;) The rooftop swimming pool is not as big as it looks in the hotel website photos but still big enough to have a swim into! The fitness room is small but well equipped it even had a wii fitness video game on and a Vibra-train (so great to exercise without effort!). Concierge people were always very nice to help with luggage and airport shuttle boarding. The first time we were there they even paid(well i guess the hotel did..)the taxi fare to take us to the airport because the shuttle was too late!

I prefer to stay in the Metropark Kowloon as its just a bit further away from the madness of Mong Kok but close enough to walk to it. It also has a pool and a better bar. The rooms are immaculately clean and you have all the usual standard facilities in the rooms - hair dryer, safe, tv (only a few english channels), tea and coffee making facilities and you will also receive a daily english newspaper, daily weather updates and 2 chocolate mints! The pool is a good size and is on the top floor - its open air and is usually shut in the cold months (December). There is a small fitness room next to the pool - it only has 2 treadmills, a bike and some weights. There are 2 restaurants in house, a chinese and a western one. The food is ok but a little over priced. I ordered a burger one night and it was quite tasty so I'd recommend that if you are staying in one night. The bar, Sip Sip Bar, is on the ground floor and is fab - the ladies that work there are very efficient and remember your favourite drinks. Its a quiet, reasonably priced and chilled out space to escape the madness of Hong Kong. If you're hungry there is also a cake shop selling pastries and breads on the ground floor which I have bought from several times. Opposite the hotel is a Wellcome shop (supermarket)and also there are several 7-11 shops around the hotel so you can buy water, snacks etc. There are a few noodle shops and bakeries also very close to the hotel and I have been to pretty much all of them and can recommend all of them! They all serve fantasic food and are within a minutes walk of the hotel. The nearest station is Mong Kok East Rail station which is on the Kowloon Tong line (light blue) and is a 5-10 minute walk away from the hotel. You can also walk to Mong Kok and jump on the MTR line (15 minute walk). You can pick up a map from reception so you know where you're going. The hotel does offer free shuttle bus service to Tsim Sha Tsui as well which is handy but sometimes the MTR is more fun :) The staff are fantastic and all speak perfect English.

I booked the hotel through a travel agent and managed to get a very reasonable rate of approximately \u00a380. The location was ideal and only about 10 minutes walk to a metro station. The free shuttle service to Tsimshatsui was very useful. The staff were friendly and efficient upon check in . The room I was allocated was very clean but in need of a refurbishment.

I liked that the curtains plunged the room into almost complete darkness. The bathroom was small but the shower was very large and water heated up very quickly.

We also made daily use of the gym and pool. The pool was wonderfully refreshing in the humidity of Hong Kong and the gym is sufficient. There were 4 machines to use and a ~5 x 3m space to stretch etc in. They also had a TV screen with Wii available. I ran into some resistance using my own exercise DVD but managed to convince the staff that nobody else would come up to use Wii (which they didn't). Hardly anyone else used the gym. I would have liked if the gym opened earlier than 730am but that's Hong Kong time for you. The location is very convenient to Mongkok, a short 10 minute walk away. There's plenty of food options around nearby including a supermarket opposite the hotel and many cafes open at all hours so meals are not a problem. The only minor issue was that we shared a floor with noisy Mainland Chinese visitors who would keep their TV on loud til midnight and open their doors wide talking loudly to each other while eating food on their beds.

They have a shuttle service that will bring you to their stop in Mongkok and Tsim Sha Tsui every thirty minutes and then pick you up at the same spot going back.

Check in was ok, though a little slow, the service in general in the hotel was very good, but occasionally we found one or two members of staff, sadly lacked the customer service element of the job. After a kip, we ventured to the club lounge for Happy Hour, which is beer, some spirits, juice etc and snacks. The snacks varied by the day. Drinks were topped up and service again in general was good. The swimming pool was closed for maintenance, which was a shame, but the weather for the duration was not 'swimming pool' weather with the exception of one day. The rooms were fine, normal city break size, LCD telly, mini bar, complimentry bottles of water suppiled. Breakfast could be taken in either the club lounge, which was more a continental affair, or downstairs in the restaurant, which is a greater selection. We tried both and the quality of both very good. As was the cake shop on the ground floor. Locally as many have mentioned is a 7/11 and circle K store, a Macdonalds and some local restaurant. Ladies Market is 5 minutes away and the MTR station about 15 minutes. We walked to the waterfront at Tsim Sha Shui in 45 mins. I would recommend going through Kowloon park if you can, a) for the relief from the traffic and b) for the relief from the 'copy watch' 'tailor' etc hawkers. Hong Kong park is also very nice. We used the hotel shuttle bus to Tsim Sha Shui once and it was fine. Booked the airport bus back to the airport with little problems.

This year we did the flower market, the\"buttons and bows market\", the goldfish street and the songbird park. All of them unique to Hong Kong. There are many interesting temples around Kowloon,some of them being very active (Tip; get hold of the book \"DK Eye Witness..Top 10 Hong Kong\" or Insight Guides \" Hong Kong Step by Step\" We explored the New Territories from the hotel on our last visit using the MTR, local buses and light railways...it was fascinating, specially the walled villages. All of these activities would be more difficult to do from hotels on the island. What about the hotel? It is functional, not the sort of place to spend a great deal of time sitting around. We found that the room we had this time was nowhere near as spacious as the one we had on our previous visit. My wife was frustrated by the lack of hanging space and drawers, we were there for 7 nights and had to live out of our suitcases. We booked room only and did not try the hotel food, a bit on the expensive side for us. We enjoy going local and so used Teresa's Cafe two doors away from the hotel. It is very LOCAL but obviously caters for quite a few evacuees from the Metropole. They have a breakfast menu in English for the English. Bacon, eggs(fried/scrambled), hash browns,toast tea,coffee and orange juice are on offer. The service is quick and friendly, the bill rarely came to more than \u00a37 for the two of us. The shuttle bus service is good, taking you to Mong Kok MTR or into TST(Star Ferry Terminal). We often gave the bus a miss as the walk to Mong Kok MTR station only takes 10 minutes. Often the bus has problems with the volume of traffic on the roads and takes longer than 10 minutes. The Metropole is great value for the money.

Since we booked for a club room, we were able to check-in earlier (we arrived around 9am) than the usual check-in time. Most hotels in Hong Kong offer hotel rooms that are really small. But with Metropark, you get the usual standard size room so its not really that small. Bathrooms were small but at least they're squeaky clean. Hotel also provide adaptors with no extra charge in case you need one. Hotel is a bit far from Yua Ma Tei MTR (10-15 mins walk) so If you have plans to go out, the hotel offers free shuttle service going to Mongkok and Tsimshatsui area every 30 mins. There's also a bus stop in the hotel so you'll have no problems with transportation As for food, we availed our buffet breakfast in the Palm Court together with the rest of the fam. They serve almost the same array of food everyday. Its not the best but its definitely a filling breakfast that would give you enough energy to tour around HK.

We had stayed here last year but only for a couple of nights, I guess you don't mind things as much when you're hardly there at all. We had a double room booked on the Metropark floor. The room we got initially was fine, faced the back of the hotel so quiet. But, when I went to unpack my case, no drawers, except for one small one in the wardrobe. What are you to do for so many nights? I didn't want to be living out of my suitcase, and as it was, husband had already taken up the space to lay his suitcase out so there was only floor space ( and limited) for mine so I'd be tripping over it all the time. We complained ( convinced also that last year the room was bigger) and grudgingly got given another room across the hall. it was slightly bigger, well thankfully big enough to store my case upright in a corner but still not a drawer to speak of. Ended up having to lay out my underwear for the week and socks adn t-shirts on the chair. Really weird. Anyway, that was the first pain in the backside. Next one - brekkie. We knew from experience the choice on the Metropark floor was a lot more limited than on the lower level but one day we were in a rush so thought we'd just get some juice, fruit and toast. This was at 10am, brekkie served until 10.30 am so not cutting it too fine. No tables laid out for any new guests, had to ask about that. Went to get a glass for juice, no glasses, asked for more. Then went to get fruit, barely a slice so asked if there was any more available, and told that was it. Great. So we went downstairs and got our brekkie there. Now this is supposed to be for business travellers as well as holiday makers. I get that most business folk would have been on their way by then, but you can't offer the service and then provide nothing. Poor service as far as I'm concerned. Otherwise, the stay was fine. Our second room desperately needed a refurb despite charging a lot more than last year. They have a hotel shuttle which we used on occassion. Best bit was probbaly the free drinks in the evening, nice to have a couple of glasses of wine before heading out for dinner. The changed the hours for this , was 4-6 but now a much more appropriate 5.30-7.30. Food - ate most nights we were nearby at Teresa's which is next to the hotel. Food fantastic, Chinese menu much bigger than the English translated one but even if you have to stick to the trnaslated one, you won't be disappointed. Can't recommend Teresa's enough! Would I stay at the Metropole again? I like the location but used to live nearby so I'm biased. Love the markets nearby, but have to question hard if I'd put up with the stanadards of the hotel. I'd rather pay more and stay at the YMCA I think.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, though lift noise can be bothersome\u201d", "Author": "danspetson", "ReviewID": "UR121405612", "Content": "Being a first time visitor to Hong Kong I had my reservations about staying here, wondering if it would be too far away. But for me it was perfect as I got to see plenty of Hong Kong, but was away from all the hustle & bustle. The free shuttle service from hotel to either MongKok station or Tsimshat sui was great. You can then pick up the star ferry over to Hong Kong island, which I loved doing, so cheap & quick & easy. Once on the island, I just hopped on & off trams all day exploring, at 2.30hk$ a time it is incredibly cheap,about 20p a ride!! Sit upstairs and just watch the street life. Hotel management are wonderful, especially Keith. Cab fares are equally inexpensive, it cost around HK$20 - \u00a32, to go from Tsimshat sui to Hong Kong Museum of history ( closed Tues / free admission Wed ). The roof top pool was nice enough - had the sun been shining i'm sure I would have loved it - unfortunately, visiting in November, i saw lots of rain.Though when I came back in December, the weather was better. The hotel Buffet breakfast offers plenty of choice & eggs freshly cooked to your liking. Take the free shuttle to Mongkok - there is a great market there - don't forget to haggle!! You can easily walk back to the hotel from here in 10-15 minutes. Conveient supermarket across the road. I'm returning here in 3 weeks and look forward to it. Area recommendations Hong Kong island MongKok station & area for market Must see Take star ferry to Hong Kong island, then Bus 15C to catch Peak tram. Ensure you have exact change or be happy to not receive change on buses. HK$2.30 for 15c per passenger, I just deposited 5HK$ for the 2 of us, was not worth worrying about a couple of pennies overpaid! Do ride the trams, impossible to get lost, they all eventually come back down the main road where you can catch star ferry after 10 min undercover walk. Now the negatives: Lift very noisy, the first room I stayed in backed onto the lift shaft and kept me awake the whole 3 nights. I returned there 3 weeks later after a trip to Thailand and was put in a different room, which although did not back onto the lift, I could still hear the lift. Some of the other guests I spoke to also complianed about the lift noise and also asked to be moved. We were all located on the club floors, so you would have hoped that these rooms would offer superior facilites and sound insulation etc. The hotel were concerned about my comments and made efforts to accomodate me, but in short the noise from the lift is awful & for a hotel of this class should not be beyond them to address! Sleep is obviously the reason you need a hotel room, so it should be the hotels priority to provide an environment to allow this to happen. Small rooms & small beds. Club rooms only beneficial if you take advantage of the free drinks. The ladies on duty are great at topping up your drinks, however if it is the guys on duty you have to ask for drinks, they will not offer. Free drinks only available between 530 & 730.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MALAYSIA", "Title": "\u201cA good hotel with free shuttle\u201d", "Author": "HBBMalaysia", "ReviewID": "UR121317413", "Content": "As requested I was given a handicapped room, non smoking floor and very near the lift.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this one - I had stayed in a Metropark in Wan Chai last year and vowed never to return, but this one in Mong Kok seems well above the average for its price point, offering relatively spacious rooms, free wired internet access, and generally a good location albeit requiring a bit of a walk to the nearest MTR station. Loved the pool as well.

It shouldn't be more than a 10 minute walk to the train station from the hotel. As for the furniture, there was nothing special. We had double beds and a bathroom with the usual small complimentary necessities. The room was clean so nothing to complain. There is free wifi in the lobby and a complimentary newspaper every morning to your room. Be sure to catch the daily hourly shuttles from the hotel to the train station and the ferry station that takes you to Hong Kong. MAKE SURE TO CATCH THE 8PM LIGHT SHOW AT THE HARBOR.

The Hotel position for ourselves was fine, we wanted to be near the shops, bathroom and electrical shops of Mong Kok and this suited us just fine. The hotel runs a 30 minute shuttle service to the shop area, but walking took just 10 minutes. Check in and out pleasant, accepable and problem free. The 18th floor room was on the small side, clean and comfortable with all expected facilities and a reasonable view of the Hong Kong sky line. The hotel is a little dated and I could find fault with decor, carpets etc, but none of this took away from the efficiency of the hotel. Breakfast is expensive, but we were given a voucher on check in which reduced the cost down for the first morning by a third, however on presenting the voucher we were told to come down each day, advise our room number and we would receive the discount each day. Quite confusing and if we did not use the voucher the first day we would not have know we could get a good discount each day. Make sure you get a breakfast voucher on check in. The breakfast selection is wide, with fresh egg cooking station and all expected breakfast choices. On two occassions, once at check in and once whilst lining up to enter the restaurant rude locals (?) pushed in ahead of us leaving us fuming in the line. Hotel staff, who could not have failed to see what had happened, should have had the courage to ignore these people and taken the next in line (us), but neither did and looked after the locals first instead of ourselves. (no further comment necessary) If you want to use a hotel computer there is a charge of 10HK dollars for 15 minutes. Very little cost but in the scheme of things penny pinching. These days most hotels have free computer use for their guests. The pool and gym area is not open until 7.30am each morning. This may well be fine for holiday makers, but for some who have business activities to take care of, this is far too late. I spent my exercise time running around the streets. The pool and gym area looked fine and inviting. Perhaps the most annoying of all was the ground floor porters, on check in our 2 cases were removed from the taxi promptly and taken to our room. On departure we manhandled five cases ( yes a very productive buying expedition) to the ground floor and were left to fend for ourselves in loading the taxi whilst the porters looked on. As an aside this reviewer finds the Mong Kok area the best in Hong Kong for a wide range of good especially if your looking for bathroom and electrical goods. So bottom line, good quality hotel, good positon for Mong Kok, but out of the way for other areas, 10 minutes walk to Mong Kok underground station and shopping, 5 minutes to main line station to China (Mong Kok East, direct line to Wo Lu and shopping at Chen Zen). All in all highly reccomended for the cost and would stay again if my business was to be around the Mong Kok area. If travelling by taxi beware, there is a Metropark Mong Kok, this review is for the Metropark Kowloon, get them mixed up and you will be dropped at the wrong hotel, our taxi driver took us to the Mong Kok hotel first.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally Good Service\u201d", "Author": "SheltieJim", "ReviewID": "UR116307480", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 5 days in July and we could not find fault with anything, The staff go out of their way to help you and are very pleasant.

Hotel is good is you are travelling alone or a couple, however if you have young kids who don't need extra bed or even if they need extra bed, the room gets cramped. The hotel did not have King sized bed, so on request, the best they could do was to put both the single beds together. The sleep quality though was ok.

I stayed at the Metropark Hotel in Kowloon from Feb 15-23 and couldn't have been happier. Other reviews have said that the hotel is not in the best location, but I disagree. It is located very close to Mong Kok only 5-10 minutes from ladies market and some very good shopping but it is still far enough away that there is virtually no noise and feels very safe. The other closest hotel I saw, the Stanford, is right in the middle of the madness. I liked that I had everything accessible but was still far enough away to get some peace. There is a hospital and school within a couple of blocks and the area is very safe to walk at night, even 4 am on your way home from LKF, Wan Chai or Karaoke. The walk to the MTR is not too bad once you adapt your walking to Hong Kong pace. I am from North America where we walk slow, but once you get up to speed its only 10 minutes at the most. The best entrance/exit to use is A2 at Yau Ma Tei on Pitt Street. Straight down Waterloo road and right after the hospital and its just before Nathan Road. Make sure you get an Octopus card, your crazy if you don't. Also, every station has a \"station map\" that shows all of the exits and the local area. I got one from every single station that I want to and found everything I needed. You can get them from the service desk where you buy the octopus card. There is a 7-11 on the corner (what corner in HK doesn't have one) where you can buy your beer or pretty much whatever else you need. The hotel prices for alcohol and room service were pretty ridiculous considering you can just walk out the front door and get whatever you need at 7-11. I would also say go for the deluxe room. the western buffet breakfast is pretty good and worth the couple of extra bucks. I ate there almost everyday for my entire stay and the food is pretty good. The beds are a bit stiff for my liking, but I really wasn't expecting perfection for 100 CAD a night. The room was probably a bit small for anymore than 2 people. I was staying solo and was really comfortable. My room was also on the 16th floor which is the club floor and is really nice compared to some of the lower floors. The view was pretty terrible but then again if you want a view go to the peak or lantau. This hotel is a really good budget hotel, worth the extra money instead of staying at one of the mansion hostels. My advice is to take the hotel shuttle from the airport. Its only 100 HKD which is really cheap compared to the 240 HKD cab ride. Some advice on bargaining at ladies and temple street... you can probably get everything for about half of what they want. dont be afraid to walk away if they wont give it to you, they will grab you before you leave the stall and give you the price you want. you know you got a good deal if they are mad about it and wont talk to you. if they settle really quick, change your mind and walk away. everything is sold at more than one place and if they settle so quickly you are getting ripped off. there is also a stall in ladies market where you can get 6 t-shirts for 100 hkd so if you are planning on getting a I <3 HK get it there or you are paying too much.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NSW", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "LorraineCopa", "ReviewID": "UR97266857", "Content": "The breakfast and shuttle bus made it for us.

I know some rooms like the suites are upgraded so If you are planning on staying in a standard room, this place is definitely not for you. The hotel is also a 15 minutes walk to the nearest subway/mta station. They do provide free shuttles but many times it's full in the morning and returning is a nightmare since you have to time yourself to reach the boarding area at the right time. A minute off and the driver would leave. The shuttle stops service at 10:30pm so you'll have to hail a cab in which case many cab drivers will refuse to drive you because driving is actually just a few minutes away and not worth their trouble. The only good thing about this place is our housekeeper who was super friendly and made me smile every morning and the free internet access in the rooms (not wifi).", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cValue for $$!\u201d", "Author": "QiaQia", "ReviewID": "UR97179819", "Content": "Strategically located within many eateries in the vicinity.

On the other hand, for Hong Kong, it's very well priced. You could do worse, but I'd suggest trying somewhere else and/or paying a little more. Location: The hotel is about a 12 minute walk to East Mongkok station (not particularly useful) or a 15-20 minute walk to Mongkok station and Nathan Road. Even short distances take longer on foot in Hong Kong because of all the crowds and traffic! During the cool season the distance is just far enough to noticeably chew time out of your busy stop-over. During the hot season it would be really quite annoying. There is however a free shuttle bus to Mongkok and Tsim Sha Tsui every half hour, which was good. Service: The service is a serious letdown. There was a long queue at check-in, they had my reservation but none of the details (booked through Ctrip which has always been very reliable). We were offered a smoking room or a room with single beds. Not what we booked. When I got on my high horse, a non-smoking double room was miraculously produced. Worse was to come on checkout. We were cutting it fine for the airport in Shenzhen so I asked the concierge for the fastest way to the airport. He advised us to take a bus from a shopping mall 10 minutes away by cab. When we got there, we found that the bus would have taken twice as long as he said it would and was fully booked. Having wasted 20 minutes on this exercise in futility we ended up catching a cab at considerable expense and much greater stress than necessary. Environment: The rooms etc are quite reasonable and would count a rundown three star or good 2 star in most parts of the west. The beds were somewhat hard (as is asian habit/preference) but bearably so. The rooms are clean and reasonably well presented.

Transport - it is great when you are travelling with a parent in the senior citizen category and there is a direct coach link between airport and hotel. Costs HK98 per person per trip. The ride can be booked upon arrival at Counter B17 in the airport. The free shuttle bus service takes you straight to Mongkok (where you can easily find the MTR, Ladies' Market and Fa Yuen Street with innumerable shops selling sports shoes at prices around $20-$30 lower than in Singapore) and Tsim Sha Tsui (MTR, big shopping malls and many different types of shops including bakeries, cafes, bookstores, retail stores, and so on - the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, Space Museum, Ferry terminal are also nearby). But if you prefer to be very near the MTR, you might wish to choose other hotels because to me, it is not within walking distance to any station. Amenities nearby - a supermarket across the road, eateries and bakeries lining the street on the side of the hotel. My only issue (which is a big one for me) is the ventilation/air con system in the rooms. Had trouble getting a good night's sleep which is unusual coz I always sleep like a log.

We paid a total of $HK2253 for three nights in the comfort room from wotif.com. Make sure you tell the taxi driver Metropark KOWLOON not Mongkok. Even though I told our driver this and pointed to the hotel on the map, and he even looked at it with his magnifying glass, he still took us to the wrong hotel! Luckily taxi fares are cheap, only $HK18 for the first 2kms. When we first walked into the room, it absolutely stunk of cigarettes. Unfortunately as I found out that night, the smoke was coming through the vents in the ceiling (see photos). I woke up in the middle of the night suffocating in a cloud of cigarette smoke. Although we were on a non-smoking floor, the guests next door were smoking up a fire. It was quite disgusting everytime we returned to our hotel room we would be hit with the stink of cigarettes. Also the walls are thin so turn up the air con to create white noise to block out the people next door. However, the higher I turned up the air con, the faster the cigarette smoke came in through the vents!! Housekeeping did the bare minimum. They made the beds yes, but they did not tidy up the room, e.g. empty bottles of water were not disposed of, the room service menu which I was reading and had left next to the bed, was left on the floor next to the curtains and I had to look around the room for it, towels were not folded properly and I doubt that new towels were issued even though I placed them in the bath and there was blood on the door handle to the bathroom (see photos). The room was quite run down for a 3.5* hotel. The porters are good and took our luggage up to the room and they opened the hotel doors for us which is nice. In terms of location, it is a 10 minute walk to the Ladies Market and Mongkok MTR. There are a few buses (81c, 271) that go past the hotel down Nathan Rd to the Temple St Markets. There are a couple of bread shops near the hotel and many convenience stores such as 7eleven where you can buy alcohol. If you like pets go down Victory Ave. The two starrred Michelin yum cha restaurant - Tim Ho Fun, is nearby on Kwong Wa St. Regarding the free shuttle (the wee bus!), there are only two stops, first in Mongkok about 3 blocks from the MTR and the second at TST. Judging by the little booklet thing they gave us I thought there would be three stops in Mongkok but no, so I wanted to get off but the driver wouldn't let me, then 10 minutes later he stopped the bus and told me to get off but I refused and told him I have no idea where we were, so I ended up in TST!! Regarding the hotel shuttle to the airport (not the airport express shuttle), you have to pre-book, that is before you check-out. It cost $HK98 per person. It took ages to get to the airport (1.5hrs) because it stopped at various hotels and got stuck in many traffic jams around Mongkok. 45mins later and we were still in Mongkok! There is free cabled wi-fi which was useful. Ethernet cable is provided in the drawer. The tv is the old box style and the reception wasn't that good and the channel selections weren't as varied as at other hotels.

Airport shuttle service to the hotel was quick and efficient. Upon arrival, we had no problems with the bell-boys bothering us for tips as we have read in several reviews. We simply said we could manage ourselves. Checking-in was smooth with no hiccups, we were upgraded to the newer rooms. The view in our room was nothing fantastic. The walls felt a bit damp and sticky, especially the section below the air-conditioner unit. The room had a musky smell, would have been nice if the room had air-freshener etc. The bathroom was just the right size, compact and truly functional. Our only gripe about the bathroom was the loosened shower rod which felt as though it could drop off anytime we were showering.

Shuttle bus service was good but locations were limited - just 2, Mongkok and Tsim Sha Tsui. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It was clean and quiet. However, the one and only thing that turned us off - the unabashed driver of the hotel's airport shuttle bus taking us to the airport. He seemed to be overly nice to us during the journey from the hotel to the airport. Upon arrival at the airport, he took out our luggage from the compartment below the bus. As he was doing that, he turned to us with a big smile on his face and practically opened his mouth to ask us for tips. We were taken aback but tipped him nevertheless. We have taken countless shuttle buses provided by hotels and had never encountered such a situation. It is not about money but seriously, was it so hard for him to pull out our luggage without expecting anything in return? Afterall, we had already paid the required transport fee to the hotel.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood price-quality ratio for a very decent hotel\u201d", "Author": "SilviaKeddie", "ReviewID": "UR73560234", "Content": "The Metropark Kowloon is a good hotel with very good price-quality ratio.

The servers were very prompt and the girls offered to get us more drinks when they saw that we were nearly finished. There were canapes provided - mini fruit tarts, spring rolls, chicken satay etc which went nicely with the drinks.

However, the Park Lane is at least three times the price so you do really get what you pay for. Me and my husband stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, booked by our travel agent for a fantastic rate of circa \u00a350 a night (minus buffet breakfast). Prior to visiting the hotel we were emailing the hotel to inform them of our plans including booking airport transfers etc - all emails were promptly answered. We had booked the airport transfer for HKD98 per person which I would recommend unless you are getting the airport bus and know your way round HK - a ticket on the airport express will set you back about HKD90 per person anyway, and even then you will have to work your way to the hotel itself. Better to be picked up and taken there. The transfer bus goes to other hotels in Kowloon as well (depending who has booked) but if you don't mind staying on the bus for a while whilst other people are dropped off, then this is really the best way to get to the hotel. Upon arrival we were told that check in is on the first floor - a bit strange but hey ho. Good points: 1. We were upgraded to the club room but to be honest, still felt it was cramped (can't imagine what the standard rooms are like) but this is HK and I know rooms are notoriously small due to the lack of space. 2. Room is clean and is cleaned every day. 3. Loved the shuttle bus which runs every 15 minutes in the morning and then every 30 minutes. Stops at Mong Kok station and then TST. Although, it operates on a first come first serve basis and I can see people having to wait for the next bus if it's full. Right, here are my gripes about this hotel: 1. Location - I frequent HK on average once a year and know my way round. The shuttle bus is fantastic, but the nearest tube stop is about 15 minutes walk away (not nice in 30 degree heat and 94% humidity). HOWEVER (a big however), the price reflects this and there are plenty of buses from TST/Nathan Road which stops right outside the hotel so if you do miss the shuttle, there are options (which are cheap - bus fare on the No.7 was about HKD4) 2. Staff - my main gripe is with the bellboys. The staff here are the nicest Cantonese staff I've come across (and that's saying a lot considering I'm Cantonese and know what the culture is like). However, I do not appreciate the bellboys immediate expectation of a tip. As a rule, I do not tip unless someone has gone above and beyond their job description - after all, a tip is an expression of gratitude for another person's service/help rather than their fee. When we arrived at the hotel, our luggage was whipped off the bus and we were given a ticket - very efficient. However, the bellboy which delivered our luggage, took the suitcases into the room and then stood IN THE ROOM with a grin on his face and then said \"Thank you, miss\". All he needed to do was to hold out his hand for a handout to complete the picture! I hated this! I hated feeling like I had to give him something just because he was standing half a metre away from me in a small cramped room just to get rid of him. Regardless of this, I stood my ground and said I didn't have anything for him, and at which time, he about turned and left (albeit still with a grin on this face!). Fortunately this was my only encounter of unpleasantness from the staff - everyone else was really helpful and didn't expect a tip. 3. Gym - Pool is nice (a bit small but you can swim in it - that's the only thing that's important) however the fitness room is rather limited. Two treadmills, one cross trainer and one bike - and I think I counted 2 weights at about 3 kg?! Could do with another cross trainer at least as me and my husband visited the gym when it opened at 7;30am and there was already someone in there on the treadmill. Overall - my husband thought this hotel was OK (especially for hte price). However, due to the location and the manner of some of the staff, I think I'm going to kick up a fuss with my other half for next year's trip and book the Park Lane (albeit at triple the price - says a lot about this hotel really.....).", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cLovely food, helpful staff, great pool\u201d", "Author": "MyfanwyBirmingham", "ReviewID": "UR64766505", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for an extended period in March/April and was really pleased with it.

My friend a travel agent had warned us of the location being a little out of the way, but really with the bus No8 being right across the road and the MTR being about a 10 min walk, it was really nice to be able to go out on the street and not be accousted by all the touts in Nathan road, and very easy to get to any part of HongKong that you wanted to visit. We are not a \"tour\" family and we do research and then do all our trips on public transport at our own pace, we can then decide to stay at one location longer or backtrack if we want, and it helps our kids get an education on travel that would be not available on organised battery hen type tours. One thing I would recommend though was Rick Shaws hop on hop off bus tour on HongKong island and for a few $AUD was great value. Overall a good experience at this hotel for the price we paid. One citicism is that the non smoking rooms do smell of smoke but this is typical across asia in most cities. This is an interesting part of Hongkong to explore with the markets and great shopping being so close. Also a 10 min walk to the East Rail line in Mongkok to catch the train to Shenzen which was again agreat experinece for all of us.

The chocolates with the turn down service were appreacited as was the weather card which allowed some element of planning for the following days events.

The club room comes with free breakfast (which at $128 is expensive) but it is of a high standard and covers all but the most difficult of persons wants. Also tried the other restaurant and found the food and service to be first class, especially like the set menu of allowing you to pick 2 main meals to mix and match. The club rooms also come with the added benefit of a private lounge for breakfast which later serves afternoon snacks and drinks but only between 17.30/19.30 hrs so its first come first served on the snaks as they don't get replaced.

Check in at the lounge was quick and efficient. The rooms were small but spotlessly clean. We asked for non smoking and there was not a whiff of smoke or any other smell. Our cleaning lady did a great job. We had a twin room which was a little cramped and little space for hanging or drawers and only one bed side chest (the drawer didn't open). My friend had a double which gave her more room. The bathroom was spotless with a good range of amenities. I didn't like the shower over the bath and shower curtain but that is a personal thing. Free internet & 2 bottles of water each day. Nice touch of the chocolates & weather note each night. Slippers and robe. Electronic safe which held the laptop. Breakfast in the restaurant was great with good variety, eggs cooked to order & very fresh fruit. The range in the lounge was not as good. Drinks in the lounge 5.30-7.30 was good, baileys included! Snacks were very limited and not replaced if near the end of the time which was disappointing. We asked for a room with a nice view and unfortunately were allocated one at the back facing a block of flats, we rarely opened our curtains.

A couple of doors to the left a little restaurant does great BBQ meats, $56HK for a take away container of roast & BBQ pork. Across the road the restaurant NEXT DOOR to the Hoover restaurant has really nice meals, even at 10pm at night. We had laundry done across the road, 7lbs for $28HK.

Otherwise the hotel had been recently refurbished (you sank into the corridor carpet) and was generally a pleasant place to stay. The beds are soft by Chinese standards. Good choice of TV channels inc BBC world. The service was very helpful and friendly; breakfast was very extensive and a good mix of Chinese and Western. The hotel is not in the middle of things but it is in a Chinese residential area so there are plenty of places to eat and shop locally as well as plenty of laundries - I got 2 huge bags done for 36 HKD. There is a shuttle bus which takes you to Mong Kok and TST and runs at least every half an hour. It is walking distance to Mong Kok MTR and the Ladies Market too. The hotel can also arrange an airport shuttle bus for you which is about the same price as the Airport Express train (98HKD) and saves you the trouble of having to carry your luggage anywhere. Internet was available in the hotel - free if you had your own PC or 10HKD for 15 minutes if not - which I think is a bit steep. However Internet cafes were not easy to find although you can use internet free at MTR stations and Pacific Coffee Houses, but it's a bit restricted as to how long for in those places. There's a very nice (heated, if small) pool on the top floor along with a small gym. Make sure you ask for a no smoking floor if you want one because we did not check and ended up on a smoking floor and when someone was smoking next door the smell came into the bathroom.", "Date": "November 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stop over venue\u201d", "Author": "Titch87", "ReviewID": "UR48662734", "Content": "A lovely hotel in a good location.

Our breakfasts in the Club Lounge were first class and pleasantly varied.We particularly enjoyed the Congee. Our only other meals taken frequently in the hotel were in the SipSip bar and we both enjoyed all our meals there especially the Fish and Chips ( to die for ) and the Nasi Goreng!!

We found that getting and using the Octupus card was a great tip and we would recomend using the MTR as often as possible { much easier and more friendly than the London Underground } and with stops near every place you are likely to go.

Simple, clean, efficient and accommodative.\u201d", "Author": "TheWindflower", "ReviewID": "UR46462617", "Content": "From the outside, the Metropark Kowloon doesn't harbour anything interesting. It sinks into the background of Kowloon with the rest of the terraced buildings that seem to mirror each other throughout the area. I found the location to be perfectly adequate for what our purpose of staying in Hong Kong was. I was on a sightseeing holiday and wanted to see as much grain of HK culture as possible and therefore did not mind finding my way around the often perplexing streets of Yau Ma Tei and Kowloon as a whole. Hong Kong Island is easier to find your way around, but if you do not mind referring to your map in the initial stages, the location of the hotel was apt to my preferences. You are close to Mong Kok, and various market streets such as Temple Street, Ladies Market and Jade Street. The groundfloor entrance encompases a simple longue area, and an information desk; staff who will help you out with simple directions and hotel procedures but offers very little else. The interior is modern but inglorified; it will never be a palace but it has a comfortable clean ambience. Attached onto the groundfloor is a bar and further on; a cake shop. On the upper levels, there is an overpriced and rather unfulfilling restaurant (with a very low choice of food), banquet area for functions, and swimming pool and fitness area combined on the 19th floor. Free Wifi is available on the groundfloor only, so do not expect to be able to connect wirelessly to the internet in your room. You have to make your way up a level to the 1st floor to find the check-in/out desk. There are usually a maximum of 4 staff at any one time so being dealt with is pretty zip-zap. Aside from checking in and out, there is a dedicated money exchange point. Whilst using this area to exchange HK$ into smaller denominations is fine, a bank across the road may offer you a better exchange rate for travellers cheques. You may want to take the time to see if you can get a better deal. Staff are helpful enough within reason, but sometimes come across like they are not very interested. I myself know the monotonous repetitive nature of the workplace, but upon recieving help you felt you where interupting their \"sighing\" time. It was far more stated in the male staff than the female. No real rudeness was emphasized though and anything I queried was resolved painlessly. Upon check-in, I was asked to pay a HK$500 deposit incase we incurred any charges for services whilst in the hotel (eg: room service, adult films, etc) We had been placed in a Standard Room on the 18th floor. The room was very no thrills and lacked any amenities so to speak of. The room consisted of on suite bathroom & twin single beds. There was a small walk in cupboard for a reasonable amount of clothing but only very few clothes hangers. The room consisted of a fridge, television set with a fairly limited amount of channels, alarm clock, and radio (which featured the music currently playing throughout the hotel). There is an ethernet port for wired access to the internet and to my knowledge was free uncapped usage however I had not brought my laptop on the trip so I could not test to see if this was true. Other simple additions were a kettle, a small unimpressive hairdryer and cheap tea and coffee products. Towels in the bathroom are changed upon your request. If you wish to have clean towels, you should place your used towels in the bath and the cleaners will give you some new clean ones. Giving you the choice on whether to have new towels or not is an effort to reduce pollution to the Hong Kong coastline which has partly been a result of the clothing deturgents dumped into the surrounding waters and harbor of Hong Kong. Placed in the room were some very small bottles of alcoholic beverages such as Whiskey, Scotch and several soft drinks placed in the fridge. I am teetotal but we were unsure whether to even touch these as we did not believe that they would be complimentary and would probably eat into our service deposit. Whether this was true or not, we did not find out and at the end of our stay recieved our HK$500 back in full. The hotel staff did provide us with two free bottles of water everday after the staff had cleaned our room. We were in a room at the back end of the hotel so our view was little to behold. It led onto a dainty backstreet overlooking flat accommodation. The beds were not the most comfortable in the world but I have slept in far worse in the past. They are firm but I would imagine for anybody but the most discerning person, are tolerable and you will get a good nights sleep. A little perk is that you can have a choice of pillow made out of different material upon request. This may be useful for anybody who has an intolerance to certain synthetics but I did not have much use for it as my pillow was very comfortable. Inside on the groundfloor and to the left, you will find the Sip Sip Bar which does seem to be quite popular with many of the hotel customers dispite the location of the hotel being in the epicentre of an area with a vast amount of tastes and smells. The hotel doesn't seem enchanting enough personally to warrant spending much time in the bar. There are far cheaper and more atmospheric places to be, none of which are a million miles away. Even on a rainy day I would not give the bar much heed. The bar stayed open till around 11pm The cake shop which is also open to non-hotel customers gives a standard choice of pastries that follow a similar fashion to the abudance of bakeries in the city. Everything I tried in here was delicious but suprisingly given the time of year, there were no mooncakes to be found. (We visited during the Mid-Autumn Festival) I suggest to look around the city if you have a taste for desserts, the selection is vast. The cake shop was open to 8pm. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus that service begins at 8am, and lasts till 10:30pm. We used this service once or twice at the start of our trip to get to the star ferry quickly. It only stops twice; in the centre of Mong Kok and beside the Avenue of Stars at Tsim Sha Tsui. The shuttle bus is convient on an evening also if you fancy an enjoyable evening of dining. There are an infinite amount of good places to eat in Tsim Sha Tsui. If you want to get over to Hong Kong Island quickly and you've already had the joy of using the Star Ferry, opt for using your Octopus Card and using the MTR instead. The location of the hotel is situated on Waterloo Road. This makes it fairly easy to get to places like the central hub of Mong Kok, and is about a 15 minute walk to Nathan Road. Yau Ma Tei station is the closest MTR station to the hotel and will take you the same amount of time to get to as Nathan Road as it is adjacent to it. Along Waterloo Road, there are several Seven Eleven stores (about 2 minutes in between each other) and one or two very cheap diner-esque eateries that cater to quick Cantonese Cuisine. If you just want something quick to eat in the morning for breakfast or a late night bite before you go to bed, then it's a fairly decent area. A little further down you can also find McDonalds for anyone needing an american fast-food fix and is also open 24 hours a day. This is not a luxary hotel and those seeking a relaxing holiday should maybe even bypass Hong Kong all together, it is not a sit back and relax sort of place. This hotel was perfect for it's intention. Hong Kong is not a place to spend your days drindling in the service of hotel staff and for any doing so - I can't help but feel you are wasting your money. This hotel is for sleeping and waking up, and that is pretty much the jist. For those wanting anything else, you will not find it in this hotel. Try the Penninsula if you want to be lavishly waited on, but if you can afford the Pennisula I don't think you'd be considering the Metropark Hotel Kowloon in the first place.

I stayed here during my last 3 nights, and despite the location, i must say i don't regret my stay here at all! Location and transport: It's located at Waterloo Road. The nearest MTR is around 10-15 minutes walk away (according to my friend). But i haven't tried, because the hotel provides free shuttle bus for hotel guests which leaves every half hour to \"Fa Yun Road\" in Mongkok near Ladies Market, and also to \"New World Center\" in Tsim Sa Tsui, which makes it really convenient. You can also take a ride back to the hotel from those places. The bus leaves ON THE DOT, so you should not be late even for a minute. I think this is really good because we never have to wait for the bus unless if *we* are late. There are same HK cafes (\"char chan teng\") nearby. There's one two doors away from the hotel which serves amazing food (I think the name is \"Gwong Dong Char Chan Teng\"). I love the \"Char Siu Egg Sandwich\"! Just heavenly! It opens till 12am, so it's ok even if you are hungry at night. There's a 7-11 down the road from the hotel, and opposite is a supermarket (\"Well come\"). \"Mannings\" (\"Guardian\" to Malaysians - a pharmacy) is also within walking distance. There are bus stops in front of the hotel. And i believe there's a free shuttle which takes you to Kowloon station for the \"Airport Express\". I'm not sure how you can get to the hotel from the airport, as i moved here from another hotel instead. But anyways, the hotel provides shuttle services to and from the airport. It leaves every hour to the airport at HKD98 per person. Reservation is required. Room: The hotel provides two free bottles of water everyday. The room i had is bright, clean and spacious. Good enough for two girls who had done tons of shopping anyways! The toilet is clean (my room has no tub, but i'm ok with it. The shower is strong, and it's easy to control the temperature) with sufficient space. When i say \"bright\", i meant the windows are large enough that sufficient sunshine can enter and brighten the room without needing artificial lights during the day There's no stuffy \"claustrophobic\" feeling (since the room is kinda spacious too anyways). At night, i like how the room lights are really bright, which really makes a huge difference from other hotels i've stayed in. If you don't like it, you can always opt to switch off some. My favourite part of the hotel is how you can choose your preferred type of pillow! There is a card by the bed which asks you to call the housekeeping should you want to change them. There's four different types to choose from. I prefer contour pillows, while my friend prefers down-feather pillows, so we requested for them. I had a good night sleep EVERY NIGHT because the bed and pillow (and also the duvet not forgetting) are so comfortable! If not because we had to wake up early, i wouldn't mind sleeping in! Room service is good. We do not have to wait too long whenever we request for the pillows, or weighing machine... etc. As for the staffs, they are really friendly and helpful.

For the record we did NOT stay on the Club-floor (but in a standard room). Cleanliness: The hotel in general was kept very clean from the entrance to the lobby to the room. Location: Although the hotel is not located centrally on the waterfront, it is a nice 10-15 minute walk to Mong Kok MTR station. On this walk you can see locals of all ages going about their daily lives - something you don't get to see if you stay in a more commercialised, central location. From Mong Kok MTR you can get to all main tourist attractions quickly and cheaply. The hotel is also located very near Nathan Road and the Lady's market. Rooms: The room was a standard size for Hong Kong. The room had enough wardrobe space and enough space to store 2 suitcases and still have some space to move. The bathroom was pretty standard. There were some complimentary toiletries in the bathroom and some tea/coffee sachets in the room. The air-conditioning was fine and easy to control. Service: The reception were pretty polite and very efficient. Value: For a bit more money you can probably get a more central hotel but your room size will be smaller and you certainly won't experience the REAL Hong Kong which millions of people live everyday. General tips: As a tourist be sure to pick-up free leaflets and maps from the HongKongTourismBoard desk in the arrivals part of the airport. You should also purchase a return AirportExpressRailway journey with 3 days unlimited travel on the MTR. This is a special package for tourists. You can load your Octopus card with money when the 3 unlimited days run out so you can use it like the London Oyster Card. The Octopus card can also be used to pay in certain shops like 7-11s and McDonald's etc. Also, when you disembark the AirportExpressRailway you can get the free bus which takes you directly to your hotel (if your hotel is one of the ones listed on the MTR website).

There is no bathtub in my room but shower is excellent. -Everything you need is in the room Eg, tooth brush set, shower cap, comb, Coffee and tea set, kettles and jug for hot water. 2 Bottles of water is provide every morning. Towel is clean and new, it will be change everyday but the mate will not take away the used one which I have no idea why. -Staffs on the ground floor are very helpful, they know all info about bus train or places u want to go. Umbrellas is provide for hotel guests when it's raining. Shuttle bus always there in front of hotel, it will leave every 30 mins to Mongkok and Tsim sha Tsui. -Room service is good. When I needed Travel Adapter, I called and asked from room service. Staff brought it within 5 mins -Hotel surrounding with Supermarket and convenient store. Such as wellcome supermarket is opposite, 7-11, K-circle and Manning store is 300 meters from hotel Con -There is no sound prove on the wall, I woke up in the middle of the night because someone nearby close the door too loud. Sometimes I could hear someone next door talking. -Hotel Location is not so close to MTR station. 15 mins by walking to Mongkok MTR. Bus stop is near by but it doesn't go to tourist places. Only 1 bus I saw go to Star ferry. -Food at the Hotel is a bit expensive. Bread at the bakery shop look boring for me. I didn't try any of them. There is Chinese restaurant next to hotel on the left side, I ate roasted duck there. Not very good and too expensive. Over all I really like the hotel.

This was my second stay. The hotel is located in a more residential area of East Mong Kok, but is convenient to Nathan Road, the Ladies Market, and a variety of public transportation that includes numerous buses (with service to Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong Island and beyond, the Star Ferry Terminal (both Tsim Sha Tsui and Hung Hom), and the Hung Hom Railway Station on the East Rail Line), two MTR Stations (Yau Ma Tei and and Mong Kok), and the East Rail Line East Mong Kok Station*. Schedules and locations of bus routes are posted in English and Chinese at each of the bus stops. The East Rail Line goes to the mainland border. In the direction of Tsim Sha Tsui the train stops at the Hung Hom Railway Station where you can take direct trains to Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing. The hotel offers half hourly shuttle bus service to a location near the Mong Kok MTR Station and then continues to the New World Hotel, across from the Peninsula Hotel, which is within 10 minutes walk to the Star Ferry Terminal. The Mong Kok MTR station is closer to the hotel (10-15 minute walk) but the Yau Ma Tei MTR station is much less crowded and is only an additional five minutes walk. To get there, once outside the hotel (and facing the street), walk to your right on Waterloo Road and continue all the way to Nathan Road. Cross to your left and the Yau Ma Tei MTR station is right on the corner. This hotel was previously the Metropol Hotel. I had read that the hotel was recently renovated, including the furnishings in the room. During this most recent stay there was indeed renovation occurring, much to my dismay. Between 11AM and 6PM there was constant jack hammering that could be heard throughout the 19 story hotel which made use of my room during these hours unbearable. That said, hopefully the construction will be very temporary. Check-in by front office staff was quick and efficient, but not necessarily \u201cwelcoming\u201d. I didn\u2019t see any smiles on the faces of any of the staff, and not just during check-in but at various times I had contact with front office staff. The staff understood and spoke English without problem. It was a different story with the housekeeping and Palm Court Restaurant staff whom I found all smiles, cordial, and willing to provide whatever service the guest needed. The room was large by Hong Kong standards (closer to the room size you would typically find at a comparable hotel in the U.S.) and was very clean, although the carpet could use a cleaning. The bathroom was also clean and included the typical standard bathroom amenities. The linens were clean and crisp. My room had a mini-bar, mini-refrigerator, and small in-room safe. My room rate included the buffet breakfast offered in the Palm Court Restaurant. The buffet included Asian and Western hot and cold entrees, various cereals, breads, and pastries, salad, fruit, and juices and tea. I found the food to be of good quality and as I mentioned above the staff were quite accommodating and service oriented. Overall, this is a good hotel that offers clean, spacious rooms at an affordable price (typically US$90-130 per night). Even though it is not located in the heart of Kowloon or Hong Kong Island, you can get to these locations within 20-25 minutes (walking + public transit) or even less if you take a taxi which is cheap and dependable. There are neighborhood restaurants in the immediate area along with three laundry businesses (they charge for cleaning by weight \u2013 very inexpensive), convenience stores, bakeries, and places to buy toiletries etc. The Langham Place Shopping Center is near the Mong Kok MTR station (on the other side of Nathan Road) and offers a variety of nice shopping, a food court, and upscale restaurants on the top floor. * Directions to the East Mong Kok Station: Exit the hotel, turn right, go to the first street (Soares Ave), turn right and walk to Argyle Street, turn left and walk a few blocks to the overpass (the East Line Railway tracks). Walk up the stairs on the other side of the overpass (immediately to your left) and follow the walkway through the office building and to the station. To get to the Mong Kok MTR, just keep walking past the overpass and continue for five more blocks. You\u2019ll see the MTR entrances on both sides of the street.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, WA 6004", "Title": "\u201cGreat modern clean hotel with great friendly service!\u201d", "Author": "happley8may", "ReviewID": "UR25217720", "Content": "The hotel appearance is very modern and clean, very much like a 5-star hotel.

And I agree with most. It is clean, good service and reasonably sized for Asia. The location is pretty good. The fact that it is a 10 min walk to the MTR is mitigated by the free shuttle to New World Centre at Tsim Sha Tsui. From there you can walk to the ferry for HK, or just check out TST. Also note the 113 bus stops on the same block as the hotel, and takes you to Hong Kong. It is cheaper than the MTR but might take longer during rush hour. Also when you are walking along the HK side, check out the bus stops for 113, because it takes you right to the hotel. Sometimes it takes a lot of walking to get to the MTR. Some of this info is provided by the back of the hotel's shuttle schedule. Read it. The shuttle from the airport is great. Though the HK transportation system is very good, the shuttle is just less hassles. When you are on the HK side, you can take the 6, 6A, 66, 120, or 6X bus to Stanley Market. It is worth going. Besides some better quality cheap goods, you can see a more natural side of HK. The main bus station is located outside the IFC Mall under a building called the Forum Exchange. Finally,visit the tourist areas like the Buddha, Ocean Park, Disneyland and Stanley Market for the weekday. The locals also visit these areas during the weekend, and unless you like endless lineup (in sweltering heat in the summer), then you should be in the stores on the weekends. At least it is air conditioned.

At the front desk I was attended by Alex, he is good and attended to all of my requests. I was surprised that he upgraded me to the Club floor which I later found out only when I got out of the elevator. Club floor cost more but I didnt pay any more than what I booked for. Thanks Alex! This hotel is great, it may be quite a walk from Nathan Road but there are interesting shops to see on the way. When I booked on-line, i got a good deal for a minimum of 3 days stay. On-line, I was hesitant to get the room with breakfast included so I finished the booking without the breakfast, however when I finally got there and saw what they offered on the breakfast buffet at the palm restaurant for only HK$90 per person (with the discount coupon given upon getting the room number at the reception) I got hooked and ate there with the rest of the family. One thing I noticed about the breakfast though is that the taste is very fitting for the asian taste, I would understand if an american or european wouldnt appreciate it that much. Although, it offered breads, pastries, yoghurts, fruits and cereals. It also has the staple local breakfast which is the congee (porridge). I suggest that you check it out first and do not automatically include on your on-line room booking. Everyday, they would give a weather card informing you of the condition tomorrow with 2 mini Andes chocolate bars with it (attached picture). Upon checking in at the room, the housekeeping personnel gave us a welcome fruit platter (orange, 2 pears, and apple). The bathroom is quite big for the HK standard and is complete with toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, sewing kit, cotton balls, ear cotton buds, shampoo, soap, foam bath, shave, sanitary bag, shower cap, hair dryer (attached picture) The room has a wide flat screen TV, 2 free bottled water everyday, electric boiling kettle, ref, and they give newspaper daily. The carpet's design is off for my taste but that didnt bother me that much really. You could change your pillows from a range of choices for free (attached picture) If you need to buy any groceries (water, cola, etc) there is a Wellcome convenient store (like a 7-11) just in front of the hotel. At Wellcome, you could buy a lot, it even has a sushi section and chinese food section to go at grocery prices. Here is where I also load up for my Octupus card. I noticed that Wellcome has same items which are cheaper than 7-11's. There is also a 7-11 store one and two blocks away. Both are accepting Octupus card payments. The hotel offers free shuttle bus to Mongkok, Tsim Sha Tsui and back to hotel which is very convenient. If you want to eat chinese, outside the hotel there are restaurants offering inexpensive authentic chinese food. With just minutes of walking from the hotel, you are already at the famous ladies market Lounging at the pool is great while the kids play at the Nintendo Wii for free. Oh bytheway, never forget to get an octupus card at the airport if you want to take the MTR, tram, ferry, and buses, load up high since you could redeem what's left when you return the card at the airport anyway (although they deduct HK$7 from what is left) My tips to your trip to HK: a) get an octupus card and never forget to return back for you to receive your deposit. b) consider not taking the peak tram on a holiday/special day as the line may be very long. What is appalling is that the long single line diverge to a wider line which makes people get unruly in converging again to a narrow line. Pushing and shoving happened while I was carrying my infant daughter. An alternative is to just take the bus # 15 which goes directly up to the peak (terminus of bus #15 is located beside the bus #15C at the Central Ferry Terminus ) c) just take a taxi to and from the airport if you are a group of four, it is cheaper and more convenient. Although if you are really on a tight budget, from the airport, take citybus A21 and get off at mongkok at nathan road, then take a cab to the hotel. d) At the airport, if your gate is 40 and above, it takes about 15++minutes from the immigration, e) when you go to the victoria bay where you see the walk of the stars, stay away from those fortune tellers that will try to fool you for money. On the last day, I wanted to book thier hotel shuttle bus with our now huge bags to the airport for convenience. The manager who attended to me advised me that the price of HK$110 is the same rate for both adults and children and proceed in advising me that as an alternative, I could just opt for a taxi which actually costed me for only HK$230 (for the 4 of us on the taxi, that is equal to HK$57.50 for each) He even managed to call a taxi for us upon seeing us go down upon cheching out. Overall one would feel that the staff really does their best effort to provide the best service.

I actually checked out whilst I visited China and the conciege were good enough to look after my large suitcase until I checked back in 6 days later. No charge for the internet either. The location on Waterloo road is handy for shopping in Mong Kok with the ladies market and Fa Yuen St just round the corner. There are a couple of banks just across the road so dead easy to change money. Exchange rates are always better in HK and the banks have the best. There are many bus routes running past the hotel and the MTR is just a 15 minute walk down Waterloo road towards Nathan road @ Yau Mei Tei. Don't forget to get your Octopus card at the airport (Airport Express) it will save you messing around with money for fares and you can surrender it on your way out and get unused money back!. Didn't bother with the hotel breakfast as I prefer to visit the Chinese bakeries. There are couple in the area and they have the most amazing buns both sweet and savoury.

I was worried because I had booked the other 4 days months in advance, but just booked the extra two days on the beginning the night before when were making our decision to leave China. I didn't want to have to change rooms two days into our time in Hong Kong, or have any hassles. This is where the excellent customer service came in. We arrived at the hotel, approached the concierege, and were greeted pleasantly and found out that they had merged my two reservations and put us in a great room for our 6/7 days with them on the 18th floor (room 1828 was great). One floor down from the swimming pool which I knew my daughter would want to use often to soothe her legs from all of the walking. The room was a good size, with plasma TV, queensize bed (and VERY comfortable at that), table and 2 chairs, clean bathroom, good air-conditioning. Really good accomodation for the price. I heard NO noise day or night when in our room. The hotel provided free shuttles on the half hour to Monkok or The New World Shopping Centre at Victoria Harbour - which was within walking distance to The Hong Kong Space Museum, Hong Kong Art Gallery, Star Ferry Terminal at Victoria Harbour, Hard Rock Cafe, etc. Location of this hotel was also within walking distance to Monkok Subway station (10-15 minutes), Goldfish Market, Flower Street, Bird Market, Ladies Market (all very interesting places to see). Also, the hotel was a block from a 7-11 convenience store for stocking up on beer, coolers, milk, juice, snacks, etc. Although, we do not do fixed \" tours\", this hotel did have quite an option of tours to choose from, and if you are interested, you could also buy your Ocean Park or Disneyland tickets from the hotel. We didn't eat at the restaurants in the hotel, we are more for going out and eating local food. But they looked okay. If you leave the hotel, turn right, there was a great local restaurant with really good, food (I had a vegetarian stirfry with noodles to die for!!)

The location was nice for us, being more a a neighborhood area but still walkable to Mongkok Station. There was also free internet in the rooms, which was very nice. The rooftop pool was nice as well, although fairly full of noisy overweight foreign tourists. The staff we came into contact with over the entire 3 weeks (bellboy, front desk, room service, swimming pool, bakery, etc) were all extremely rude, with the exception of one female lifeguard who was very friendly. The first room we were given was a standard room, which had 50's-esque old carpeting, bedspread, and bathroom. It felt like a roadside motel, not in a good way. Additionally, construction noise of jackhammers, saws, etc, permeated the entire hotel beginning at 9am sharp every single day including weekends. This was at a deafening level. Our work hours outside the hotel were noon to 9pm, so being there in the morning trying to rest or shower or take care of emails and phone calls was not at all pleasant or even tolerable. Our client was not informed of the construction when she booked the hotel, so they moved us to a \"club\" room to make up for the noise. The club room was a few floors higher, but we could still hear the construction noise quite a lot. However, the bathroom was a lot nicer, and the other amenities were quite a bit nicer as well than in the standard room. The club floor rooms are supposed to come with breakfast, but upon attending the breakfast we were asked our room number, then refused and told that since we were a longterm stay we would not get breakfast. The client called about this issue as well, and we were granted breakfast afterall. This was still a bit of a misfortune as the food was less than desirable, and reminded me of the chewy/mealy/day-old or more breakfast items at touristy London hotels. As compensation for all this, the hotel offered us $30 USD in laundry. We were able to get about 5 pairs of underwear and one pair of pants cleaned for this price. Down the street, we dropped off 28 pounds of laundry at Good Luck Laundry and had everything back and folded and delivered that night for $14. One night, I brushed my teeth and got ready for bed. My husband went into the bathroom 5 minutes later to do the same only to find there was no water. A few minutes after that, a note was slid under our door telling us that there was no water in the hotel until further notice. The next morning, there was another note saying that breakfast would not be held on the club floor and that the internet room and happy hour room would be closed as well until further notice. Then, my room key also stopped working. I took it to the front desk, who were rude and put-out about remagnetizing it. The key still did not work. I took it back, they remagnetized again, I went back up to the 16th floor again, it still did not work. I took it back to the front desk and still had to spend several minutes insisting on being given a new key while they tried to remagnetize it yet a third time. We had to leave a card in the light switch in order to turn the lights on- a good way to remember to turn the lights off. We started leaving a business card in the light switch instead, and pulling it out to lay on top of the controller when we left the room. Housekeeping left the lights on almost all day every day we had them come in once the card was placed there. You must also have housekeeping come any day you want to receive your 2 bottles of free water per day since the water at the hotel is undrinkable. A few nights, we didn't get off work until well after most restaurants close at 11pm and were exhausted. Room service. The person answering the phone generally had trouble understanding our order and was unfriendly about this, even though the menu was in English and most of the other staff were very capable with English. It seems a bit wrong that this poor staff member was the one assigned to phone duty for what were likely to be English-speaking room service customers. It would take about 45 minutes to receive a grilled cheese or spaghetti. The food was very processed and not fresh tasting. Bread seemed stale, like at the breakfast. It reminded us of lower end airplane food. I do suspect the root of the problem is with management rather than the staff, as the staff all seemed pretty unhappy with their lot. I'm sure the decisions about noise, etc, were also being made by that same management. We left the hotel for a few nights to go out of Hong Kong and came back one night before our final leaving to the airport. Again, the front desk was quite rude and short with us upon checkin. However, when we got to the room, there was a basket containing a semi-old orange, banana, and apple with a letter asking us to join their frequent travelers' club. We did not choose to join, and hope to either meet a friendlier new staff and management, a new cook, and be told ahead of time if there will be construction noise... or stay elsewhere our next time in Kowloon.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cgood experience\u201d", "Author": "chalkyEngland", "ReviewID": "UR18265221", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights.

The breakfast was great- had all the things an American buffet breakfast should have, I love watermelon! But the staff were quite surly. The happy hour was great too- it included hot and cold snacks as well as beer and wine, and we got to socialise with some great people. Also internet was free in a room off the club lounge. The room itself was large with plenty of toiletries in the bathroom and was very clean. Only complaint I had was the bed was as hard as they say! But I never got a sore back or anything from it so maybe hard beds are really good for you! The shuttle solved the problems of being away from the central shopping/nightlife, but we didn't mind the short walk to Mongkok each day to the ladies market and shopping etc. And we once walked back from TST back to the hotel which wasn't too bad as we were exploring anyway. The bakery down stairs had lovely curry buns which my Husband kept buying for snacks.

(just a quick heads up, you need to put youre used towels in the bath tub if you need them replacing with fresh ones) the top floor is dedicated to a small gym (two treadmills and a cross trainer and some freeweights) and the best bit of all, the nintendo wii, WITH TWO CONTROLLERS :) i was quie surprised to see no one hogging the wii although May is supposed to be a quiet time according to the locals. either way we wernt complaining. the pool is also alot bgger than we thought, it is true that you can do lengths. overall, the hotel is deffinitley worth staying in and i would recommend it to sudents aswell as couples, who we saw a lot of whilst hanging out near the roof top pool. planning on going back in september and i have no reason not to want to stay here again", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, great service\u201d", "Author": "moonrakerSwindon", "ReviewID": "UR16433754", "Content": "Just back from Metropark Kowloon.

The hotel website was the cheapest site I could find on the net for the Metropark with rooms only costing \u00a350 GBP /night for a standard room so we upgraded to a Club Room for \u00a325 GBP extra per night. This gave us a high room floor, complimentary breakfast and free drinks and snacks in the Club lounge between 5-7pm. The snacks consisted of sandwishes etc, but the bar was fully stocked with premium brands all free!! Breakfast was great. An extensive buffet that all tasted great. The location of the hotel was OK, but not fantastic. About 5 min walk from Nathan Rd, but once on Nathan Rd you found yourself quite far along away from the Harbour. The MTR train station was about 7min walk , with The Peninsula Hotel/ Avenue of The Stars/ Water front a brisk 30min walk. Don't let these walking times put you off though as taxis pull in to the hotel pick up zone and are very cheap - about \u00a35 GBP to the water front.

We came back to be told that the room was still not ready. We then told them that they said it would be ready, and to this they said that they had found a room to give to us. Our luggage was taken to the room to be found that two very single beds was given to us. I asked the staff member that why had we been given two single beds when we had booked a double. He said that this was one of the better rooms. I then took this up with Erik Mak (the Manager on duty) at the time to be told that it had not been booked as a double. I didnt want to argue at the time as I didnt have the paperwork in front of me. I then went to the room and found all the correspondence that proved that a double had been booked. He then said that the hotel was fully booked. I told him that this hotel had been booked long in advance and we should have been told that this was not available. He also told me that the communication that he received via the international agents did not say anything about a double room. I asked him to show me this email to which he did. It definately did not state a double room but the confirmation from Thompsons Travel definately stated a double room. I then said that he should have checked upon us checking in, whether we wanted single beds seeing that we were a couple. We only go away once a year and this to us is like another honeymoon. Under no circumstances could two people sleep in that single beds. They were genuinely single beds and nothing more. I received a letter of apology from the hotel once getting back to SA but that did not alter the fact that our holiday was spoiled by this arrangement. The hotel itself was clean, breakfast was OKAY. Enough fruit to eat if you didnt want anything else, but the lack of English by the staff was bad. If you wanted them to bring you a fried egg, you had to FIND a staff member that actually understood you. The room could do with a bit more dolling up. At least a duvet to pretty the bed up. The hotel as other people have stated is very cold - the airconditioning seems to be set at a very cold temperature.

We stayed on the Kowoon side to be closer to my husband's family, but I really enjoyed staying away from the tourist traps and being able to get a feel for how people live here. I did a lot of research and found that this hotel was about half the price of comparable 3 star hotels in the area. Ultimately, that was the clincher (along with the good reviews I read here). My thoughts about the hotel: Hotel was off the beaten path, but the walk to Mong Kok was only 15 minutes (even with 2 small children), and there was a lot of interesting stuff to see along the way. We did that walk at least twice a day. The free shuttle to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui is nice too but it does take a little while. We would usually just walk. The staff was very helpful, including providing a crib for us. The room was OK-sized. The beds were a little small, but we managed, and I think it's pretty much the norm in HK. I booked with the hotel directly by email (they were very helpful), and our price included 2 free trips to & from the airport. Nice bonus! Also, the rooms have fridges. If you decide to stay here, here are some tips: If you have to do laundry, do not use the hotel laundry! It is very expensive. There is a laundry just across the street that will do a big bag of laundry for about HK$50 or so. Cheap! And they will deliver it to the concierge at the hotel when it's finished. There is a grocery store across the street. And a great little restaurant less than a block towards Mong Kok (on the same side) where you can get a full Chinese breakfast (noodles in soup, eggs, ham, and toast) for about HK$22. The staff were all very nice (just don't use the toilet). And some general things: Buy an Octopus card (you can do this at the airport). I only speak english and found no trouble getting around HK. If you are traveling with small children, HK is not the most stroller-friendly place. But we took a small umbrella stroller with us, and apart from carrying the stroller up and down stairs and over the turnsdials, we got around all right. I would take the stroller again. This was my first time to HK and I would return, for sure!

Was there with a group of friends and we occupied 4 rooms. While not everything was perfect...our wardrobe holder actually fell off...but after 2 weeks at the hotel, we were not any worse than when we checked in. In fact, we went home feeling good and our stay was an extremely pleasant one. We liked the size of room which compared to even some 4-5 stars hotel was spacious. While the rooms we had were old, but it is definitely not as run down as some other reviewers have put it. The hotel actually has newly renovated rooms but they are reserved for those staying at Metro Club..wich was fine with us since they pay a pricer rate. For a 3-4 star hotel...i have no complains at all. If I would really want to state any disatisfaction...i would say only 2 things: 1) Reception upon check-in, not once but twice made the mistake of not knowing our room rates and calculated wrongly. Despite trying to explain to the gentleman on duty on the day my friends checked-in, he refused to believe it and the tone of voice suggested that we didn't know how to count the number of nights we were staying. Finally convinced him to count together and when he realised he was in the wrong, it would have helped with a tiny apology but none was forthcoming 2) Concierge service was not exactly helpful. They were friendly and always had a smile, but somehow it did not register to them that when they see hotel guests carrying multiple items, they should offer hlep. We would have been most happy to give them tips But let me reiterate that the above were minor misgivings and the experience that we had far overides the above One last thing..it was a cold winter in HK but we slept comfortably every night coz we had a heater in the room.

For the rates that we paid, I felt it was pretty reasonable (approximately HKD2,700 for 4 nights, inclusive of taxes). The hotel can arrange for airport transfer too, priced at HKD190 per person per way, which was quite helpful as it takes approximately 10-15 minutes to walk from the nearest MTR station (either Yau Ma Tei or Mong Kok station). For HK hotels, I feel that the room size was generally ok, and the bed was comfortable with clean bed sheets. The good thing about this hotel is that there are different types of pillows available so we requested for down pillows to keep warm. The bad point was that as it was winter in HK and temperatures could dip below 10 at night, there was no heater in the room, therefore the room was too cold at night. The room and toilet were clean, with basic amenities like tea & coffee, hot water flask, etc. However, I found that the front desk receptionist was not too friendly. Although he responded to questions we had to find out more information on travelling to Macau, we had to keep prompting for the information required, and the staff seemed too eager to get rid of us and wore a hostile look on his face. A tip for hotel guests: learn to take the bus instead, as Bus No. 271 (and other services) takes one from Tsim Sha Tsui right to the hotel's doorstep.

I got my answer here and people gave it good reviews. I was worried about it being in mongkok which is... sort of... well known for being quite dodgy. but worry not because metropark is a very pleasant hotel in a good location on a very very safe and normal street. I was greeted by the doorman and the bell boy offered to carry my luggage. The rooms were tidy and the bathroom was clean.

They even put my beds together to make it easier for 3 people to sleep. there are some people who talk about the \"sars\" incident. but don't let that be a deterrent because it's unfair and unlucky that sars struck so randomly in this hotel. Metropark and Hong Kong has been revamped and are very hygiene conscious because of it. Sars hasn't appeared in hk again so fear not. The pool area was lovely and they even had a wii console in the gym. The gym was small but people don't go to hk to exercise in thier hotels they travel around to soak in the culture. Location-wise it was a bit far from main attractions but that is what I was looking for anyway cos it was nice a quiet to sleep. Whereas hotels on main streets tend to be so noisy and frustrating. There is a free bus shuttle service from the entrance which takes you round Mongkok down to tsim tsa tsui but i warn you it does take a long time to board and to make it's way round. there are local convenience stores and ATM machines opposite the hotel and a good cantonese restaurant is also opposite the hotel which serves nice dim sum in the mornings.

So my partner and I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights, from August 14 to 22. If not for their business development manager, Anita, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay 8 consecutive nights \u2013 and at a really great rate too! (We only confirmed our Hong Kong trip a day or 2 before checking in \u2013 during the busy HK Food Expo. We were one of the exhibitors. Last minute decision.) Quick and efficient service. Whether it was for extra towels, iron & ironing board or tissue paper, their housekeeping staff was at our door within 10 minutes or less. Every single time! Yes, every nice thing I read about this hotel here was true. For a 3-star hotel, they offer great value (HK$500+ a night with breakfast that normally costs HK$118) and lots of space for HK standards! And although our room was facing a busy main road with double-decker buses passing and all, we could hardly hear any traffic noise! (I always ask for and need a quiet room.) From the bathroom/shower to the pillows to the staff, we have no complaint whatsoever except for their hair dryer, it was way, way too weak, we had to buy a new one from an electrical shop. But a supermarket right across the street made up for this little problem \u2013 as I love to drink lots of good quality water and the 2 small complimentary bottles of water provided by the hotel are not only insufficient, they have a VERY strong, unpleasant taste and smell! In fact, I would have given this hotel 4 stars if not for the \u201crip-off\u201d experience at their Chinese restaurant. Each room gets a coupon good for 2 free trial dishes at the restaurant, it turned out the 2 dishes were on 2 VERY SMALL plates, to add insult to injury, one of their free dishes was a plate of tasteless, cold and tough chicken. The other plate was beef and veg., not bad but not great either, but my REAL BEEF with them are 1) the service was very slow, 2) they charge HK$10 for a small bowl of white steamed rice and 3) they charge HK$18 for a tiny plate of sauce! Yes! Sauce. If we knew about these traps, we would never have set foot at their Chinese restaurant. Maybe such rip-off tricks are common at most hotel Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong, like taxis in Malaysia, if you don\u2019t get ripped off by them, you are one VERY lucky person! Unless money is not a problem, I\u2019d suggest dining at those small \u201ccoffee shop\u201d restaurants, most of them serve pretty tasty stuff at a very affordable price, and no tips required too! It is not uncommon to find a BIG bowl of really tasty beef noodle for under HK$20! (If we really wanted to spend a few hundred HK$ on a single meal, we would have gone to only highly recommended places. By the way, their buffet breakfast is ok but absolutely not anywhere worth near HK$118 per head.) Their free shuttle may be reliable but it makes 2 stops, so if you want to get back to the hotel directly from the first stop, you either have to walk about 10 minutes, take a taxi or take the free shuttle to the 2nd stop, wait about 10 minutes \u2013 wasting a total of about 40 minutes or so of your time before you can get back to the hotel. Plus their shuttle drivers talk frequently and LOUDLY their cell phone while waiting & driving, if you understand Cantonese, you get to hear tons of swear words, it makes the journey very UNpleasant to say the least. If you decide to stay at this hotel, cross the road, take bus number 7B (from the entrance of Wellcome supermarket) to the end of the line and you will reach a waterfront town called Hung Hom, about a 20-minute or so ride away. Then take a short walk (under 10 minutes) from that bus terminal towards a huge mock ship and you\u2019ll find lots of value shops selling branded stuff. There are also many small and cheap coffee shops there. We stumbled onto one that serves one mean meal\u2026 beef noodles + super tasty chicken wings + soya drink\u2026 all for HK$19 net! Yes, I would stay at this hotel again if my budget remains at around HK$500 to HK$600 per night, otherwise, I would prefer a 5-star hotel for about HK$1,500/night \u2013 that is nearer a train station, with more shops & restaurants within walking distance.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "malaysia", "Title": "\u201cA great convenient place\u201d", "Author": "eehc_iliep", "ReviewID": "UR8449520", "Content": "We have just returned from a week stay in HOng Kong.

It was our first time in Hong Kong, so it was difficult knowing exactly where we wanted to be. We wanted a reasonably priced hotel for our 8 night stay, from 9/5/2007, with decent sized rooms, reasonably close to all areas of interest. Well we were delighted with our choice!! the hotel room was spotlessly clean, the bed was firm but very comfortable, and we slept like logs every night. ( from reviewers reports on beds in Hong Kong we were worried how they were going to be!!!). also, the hotel gives you the option of choosing from several different kinds of pillows, ( foam, cotton, feather down etc), so you're bound to get what you like. We chose a spacious comfort room, and we had a table and chairs to sit at with our tea and coffee, plenty of room I would say. Bedding changed as often as you like. The bathroom was also spotlessly clean and decent size. The staff were all very friendly, polite and always smiling. The hotel is in the Mongok area, about 5/10 minutes walk from Ladies market area and subway. Temple street is a 5 minute bus or subway ride. The whole area of Monkok is a shoppers paradise. Getting around was very easy , we used an Octopus card for buses and subway, and found the hotel perfectly situated for this. Though you can use the hotel shuttle service to get to the main area of Nathan Road, Kowloon, and tha Ladies Market. Later at night , Waterloo Road, where the hotel is, is nice and quiet, so we got a perfectly quiet nights sleep each night.

The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the popular Tsim Sha Tsui shopping area, which makes it easier to get around. The room was on the 7th floor facing the back-alley, so it was very quiet. It was small and definitely lacked storage space. I had to move furniture to be able to open my suitcase. But room and bathroom were well maintained and clean. Bed was very comfortable. Television had a wide variety of international channels. Free internet was available given you brought your own laptop and ethernet-cable. The minibar was reasonably priced, but convenience-strores were around the corner from the hotel. Breakfast buffet was plenty and satisfying. Metropark has a nice pool on the 20th floor rooftop with a great view. Gym looked good, but I did not use it. Staff was very attentive and friendly, though a bit inefficient.

Toiletries were replenished as soon as used, despite a notice advising that towels would only be replaced if left in the bath, all our linen including bed linen was changed daily. (Didn't realise I was that dirty) I was impressed with the bank of 4 square pin electrical sockets at table top level with the internet connection close by, the extra nice touch was a connector cable for use from the point to a laptop. (handy if you leave home without yours.) All the staff were very friendly and more than helpful. We did not use the dining facilities, bar or pool so cannot comment on them. The TV was not even switched on. I was more than happy with the location, yes it is away from the hustle and bustle of the exclusive shopping areas, but I liked stretching my legs with a gentle stroll to Monkok and being with the locals of Kowloon as they went about their daily business. All in all we had a wonderful time and experience, we all have different tastes, so what is good for one may not be right for another. I would happily return to this hotel for another holiday.

The whole stay in the hotel was smooth. The hospitable services provided by the hotel made me feel so much at home. I was always greeted by the room service lady when I first step out of my room every morning with \"zou san\"-Good morning and a warm smile. :) I asked for a non-smoking hotel room, which was pleasantly clean, well furnished and new! Everything you need for an above average hotel room was there, everything well provided for. I still miss the nice cosy bed and wide range of pillows that I can choose from. The room was spacious enough based on HK standard in my opinion. No breakfast for me as I chose to stay in a standard room. I will always grab some bread at the hotel's bakery just beside the entrance before I go off for my whole day of shopping spree daily. Visited the swimming pool on the top most floor, but has no time to rest and relax over there as I was busy shopping around HK most of the time, Haha.. One minor setback to this hotel is probably the distance from the Mongkok MTR, I took about 5-10 mins to walk from the MTR to the hotel at normal walking pace. However, you can always opt to take the round trip hotel shuttle bus (which operates till 1030pm) to and from the hotel instead of walking. The good service by the bus driver uncle also pleases me :) (He will state the drop off location clearly in English, and advice you accordingly, so you won't miss the place that you are going). There's also lots of buses to access various places just outside the hotel along waterloo road or simply hail a cab (fare to nearest MTR is below 20 HKD only). I walked so as to visit the shops along the way. :) Overall, a very pleasant stay in this hotel, and I will definitely stay in this hotel on my next HK trip and recommend it to my friends!", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cYou don't always get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "Blankii", "ReviewID": "UR5788293", "Content": "Unlike the previous reviewer I can understand why some people gave this hotel a bad review. However I can also understand why some people would think it's not all that terrible. I think it all depends on the timing of your visit and therefore the amount you pay for your room. For my part, I unfortunately scheduled my trip to Hong Kong during a big convention and therefore hotel prices were increased to quite ludicrous amounts. I can\u2019t say this was the fault of the hotel as every other hotel I tried to book at this time was either more expensive or fully booked. Given this situation, I was forced to pay probably twice the amount I would have ordinarily paid for the same room had I had the foresight to travel either 2 weeks earlier or later. Unfortunately as a result of this situation, the Metropole was by far the most expensive room I have stayed in during my travels in Asia, whilst at the same time being by far the least impressive in terms of quality, cleanliness and service. Not to say that these aspects of the hotel were necessarily bad, just that they were far below the standards of other hotels I have stayed in around Asia and at more than double the price in most cases. One other thing I will say is that I generally didn\u2019t like Hong Kong very much, so I think that probably also had a bearing on my overall impression of the hotel (although you could probably argue the reverse as well). As for my actual review of the hotel, firstly the positives: - free broadband internet access in the room (this was not working when we arrived, however the hotel IT manager, who proved to be extremely helpful, came and fixed it in a jiffy); - free shuttle to Nathan Road; - pillow menu with the option of a contour pillow which cured my sore neck!; - access to club lounge (I, like many others, took the advice of previous reviewers and booked and a room on the executive floor). On the downside, as previously mentioned I booked a room on the executive floor on advice from previous reviewers on this website. My general impression of the room was that it was small and cramped with a musty odour and was definitely crying out for a renovation. This was the sort of room I would expect to pay no more than $100 a night for, rather than the $300 a night I was actually paying. The further downside of this was that given the condition and standard of the executive room, I shudder to think what a standard room would have been like. Other than the room, I also generally found the service to be of a low quality although having never traveled to Hong Kong before, I suspect that I probably set my expectations too high given the excellent experiences I have had in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand. Hong Kong is clearly not like any of these other destinations and therefore my preconceptions of Hong Kong were probably unrealistic. Having said that, we did have some positive experiences with some of the hotel staff (the aforementioned IT manager and a couple of the employees in the club lounge). Overall I would rate this a moderate low end hotel, which means that if you\u2019re paying any more than $100 a night for it you\u2019re being ripped off. If you manage to stay here for less than that then I\u2019d say you\u2019re probably getting what you pay for. So, the moral of my story is make sure you have realistic expectations of this hotel before arriving and plan ahead to avoid any conventions or special holidays that push the prices of hotels up.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "nsw australia", "Title": "\u201ccannot understand those negative posts\u201d", "Author": "prudence-kitten", "ReviewID": "UR5776389", "Content": "Just stayed 4 nights in Metropark and would not agree with ANY negative comments I read on this forum.

Well, you'd be right but I'd like to start off by saying that the Metropole (or MetroSARS, as it is affectionately known) wasn't too bad and it was pretty cheap - you get what you pay for after all. My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on the third and final leg of our honeymoon. When we arrived we had to wait 20 minutes to check-in because of the queues. When we got to our room we found it was a twin room (naturally we had booked a double) and it absolutely stank of smoke (we'd booked a non-smoking room). The unhelpful staff at reception only changed their attitude when I became very angry and we were eventually given another room which did meet our specifications. I could now tell you a long story about our incredibly rude bell boy, but suffice to say that he was not very nice. At all. On a brighter note, our new room was ok. A little dark and a little small but adequate. It wasn't until night time that we found out that the Metropole really skimped when buying the pillows - they were filled with sawdust (maybe not but it seemed that way) and were highly unpleasant. So bad in fact, that we actually went out and bought our own! We didn't eat at the hotel as it was expensive and we didn't hold out hope that it would be any good considering how we'd found the rest of the hotel. And don\u2019t bank on using the pool as it\u2019s only open for around half the year. The location was ok - good for shopping with many street markets nearby running until late at night. You may have heard that the SARS outbreak started here. Well, it's true and in fact they managed to trace the outbreak to the lift area on the 5th floor.

First night was in a 'regular' executive room, however our phone wasn't working (we didn't know until they told us!) so we were upgraded for the rest of the stay to a 'deluxe' executive room. Both rooms were a good size and the regular executive room was just fine. The deluxe offering was just that little bit better, with duvets instead of blankets, nicer carpet, a 'new' kettle and slightly better television and a pillow menu! (choice of feather, buckwheat, low allergy pillows and one other type of pillow). Other features for the executive floor were: free daily breakfast in the executive floor lounge (alternatively you could have eaten at the slightly more extensive buffet on the 1st floor - no extra charge): free drinks from 5.30-7.30 each night (small range of beers and imported spirits / mixers available): free coffee / tea all day in the lounge (they had a cappuccino machine which was good): free bottled water in the room each day: free China Morning Post each day: turn-down service in the evening: fruit bowl on arrival. Housekeeping was excellent - room beautifully cleaned and our belongings nicely put away or stacked when we returned each night. Staff in the executive lounge were lovely and always helpful, happy to write down directions in Chinese for taxi drivers etc. The shuttle to the city (via Mong Kok station) ran like clock-work. We took the advice of previous posters and made sure we were at the shuttle 10 mins prior to departure and always got a seat. (The shuttle filled up a couple of times and people had to take a taxi.) The shuttle takes a different route into town than on the way back, the latter being partly on the freeway and much quicker. However going into town the traffic can be bad and the journey take about 35-37 minutes. If you are waiting at the shuttle stop in town to get back to the hotel, bear this in mind - as the shuttle can be a little late to pick you up. Oh - one time the shuttle left early from town - but only because a guest had to be dropped off at the central train station to catch an urgent flight somewhere. In terms of shopping the hotel is a close walk to the Ladies Market, and a short walk to Monk Kok KCR for the train to Lo Wu and Shenzhen (China) where there is GREAT shopping (all fakes of course!). For food, we bought filled rolls from the Metropole Cake Shop - about USD1 each. Between 5-8pm you buy two rolls, get one free. Good way to end the evening for supper. There is a supermarket across the road if you need bottled water. Just to mention that the phone from the hotel is expensive, HKD20 to call your calling card company, or HKD45 for international (minimum). There is a public phone in the lobby, or an international phone just outside the hotel (1 minute call to the States was HK5 - but cheaper if you get a calling card). The pool was open - closes in December. Looked good and clean, with two attendants to look after the 10 or so deck-chairs. The 'health-club' - well yes, I suppose it was small, but there was all you needed including weights, running machine, cycle machine. All in all - a great hotel, excellent value for the executive floor (they even let us sit in there from 0700 on the day of arrival). Other notes: - The executive lounge was very quaint! Not exactly modern, furniture in need up replacement, but in terms of a three star hotel - quite adequate. - They only have two 'twin' rooms on each of the executive floors. We booked direct through the hotel's website and you cannot specify a twin room unless you enter it manually under 'special requests'.
