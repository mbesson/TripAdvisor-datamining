The very inexpensive late night steak dinner was just possibly the worst I have ever eaten. The equally cheap buffet was just that, cheap! You might want to check out the other buffets in Vegas. I do want to thank you for the 83 degrees as it was very nice at the pool. I guess the pool is just to look at as the water temp was just above freezing.

You don't have to go anywhere because the casino,restaurants, pool, beautiful garden and bar are so easy to get to. Not like those hotels on the strip where you get lost because they are soooo big. Plus the bus stops are right outside the hotel, ready to take you anywhere in Las Vegas. I come from Hawaii where we have one of the best public transit in the US but I can say that Las Vegas has a pretty good system also.

Normally, I wouldn't pay $70 for a room in Vegas at a place called Terrible's but during a big event it seemed perfect for our purposes. Our room on the ground floor was convenient if not overly expansive. The two beds filled it pretty well but still had plenty of room for the large flat screen mounted conveniently on the wall. It was cozy and comfortable, good bedding and enough room to get to the bathroom. The bathroom...that's another story with a short wall separating one bed from the vanity so you could brush your teeth and shave while watching your roommate sleep. Not so great for my son though, trying to catch every last Z. The toilet/tub area did have a door, lending some privacy and hiding the corroded bathroom fixtures. We only used them once so what the heck. Video checkout at 5 am was nice and it was convenient that the shuttle driver slept in the bus all night. A quick knock on the door and he was ready to roll. Twelve hour shifts are a killer. The casino was fun and we won a decent amount on some very good video poker while enjoying many stout complimentary cocktails. The bald bartender at the sportsbook bar was a little surley with unsolicited fatherly advice on consumption that was unusual for a guy making good tips with good throughput on the machines. Guess he was being forced to work too hard. The bartenders in the back were much more pleasant and accommodating with great viewing of the games on large screens. The sportsbook was small but lively with knowledgeable, friendly, fast window personnel and generally good commoraderie from the crowd. Both gambling and dining (let's just call it \"eating\") were cheap and the floor atmosphere was active and cheerful. A small store including liquor sales on the property was a nice convenience for those that availed themselves of it. Good gaming promotions and freebies prevailed. We received a free hat & T-shirt just for signing up at the players club without minimum play. A nice trinket. The name Terrible's only applies to the buffet. Our experience was indeed terrible. But the Cafe has 24 hour specials which are considerably better, strange since they share the same kitchen. Cheap food is not always a value as is proven here. There is a good, family-style Italian restaurant across Flamingo from the hotel though. Now it is a value. Given the circumstances, I would stay at Terrible's again. It was a nice respite from the Strip with a good, fun-loving clientele. I won't pay $70 again, but anything below fifty is a decent deal. It's not my ideal of a perfect extended stay property, but I'm sure others would disagree. All in all, Terrible's is proof that you don't have to stay smack dab on the Strip to enjoy Vegas or it's nightlife. It's a viable off-strip option conveniently accessible to whatever you choose to do. My rating is due to more of the positive experience than specifically to the opulence of the property.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunset Beach, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cSkip the Strip\u201d", "Author": "Linda B", "ReviewID": "UR126117911", "Content": "Have been going to Vegas for 10 years straight and always stay at Terribles.

Turns out I did get a tower room but the check in attendant sent me to the wrong area. No big deal. Only 5 minutes lost. After we settled in to our room we went down stairs for a quick snack. Spent $4 dollars on a hot dog, but what a hot dog. The thing was almost as long as the cocktail table at the bar. Food wise they are very affordable. You get double what you expect as far as portions go. All in all you get what you pay for.

She had no problem doing so, I went out and tipped the driver. I was at LVH to place my \"winning Super Bowl bets and prop bets\" by 9am.

I liked some things, others not so much. My first impression when I arrived was that it kind of had that \"ghetto\" feel to it. The neighborhood isn't that great, in fact I was concerned about parking out front to check in. When I asked for help with our bags, they asked me for my drivers license, and in exchange they gave me an old cart with duct tape on the broken parts of it to go load it myself...lol. That right there pretty much sums up this place...cheap room and eats, no frills.The room was okay, but not as nice as I was expecting based on internet pics. Also the web site says that there are coffee pots in the room...no such luck. The room was physically not the same as the ones pictured on the site, but they were okay. It did seem like the AC unit wasn't cooling properly. The casino was a disappointment overall. The best thing about this place is the food, in my opinion. They only have two resturaunts, one of which is the buffet. The buffet is not excellent, but good, especially for the price. Sat. and Sun. we paid 9.99 for two breakfast buffets. You can't beat that anywhere in Vegas. On Friday night I had baby back ribs, baked potato, and corn on the cob for 9.99. It was excellent. It is nice to know that you can eat very cheaply in your casino when you're hungry. Another thing I liked about this casino was how close the underground garage was to the rear entrance. Very convenient to get to the car from your room.

This was my 3rd visit to Terribles in the last year and a half. (May 2010, July 2011 & Sept 2011.) If you like to do things on the cheap, generally don't sweat the small stuff, or expect the swankiness of other Vegas hotels, it's the way to go. The beds are very comfy. Rooms are unspectacular but clean. Pool is small but very pleasant and nice to lounge around. Good enough for me. The buffet is, again, unspectacular, but decent. (Notice a theme here?) I didn't even visit the buffet this last trip. I prefer the Bougainvillea Caf\u00e9 next door. The portions are large, tasty, the prices very reasonable, and the menu offers a wide variety of items. Due to the low cost the clientele isn't what you'll see at the nicer hotels. It's an older and lower income type crowd. But if you rather enjoy the more \"colourful\" type of people . . . I've never stayed in the tower. Just in the 3 floor horseshoe shaped part of the hotel. One plus is you won't be waiting for elevators like you get at the ginormous hotels. (Only for it to show up full.) Other positives are: The 24-hour store is very handy. Much better booze prices than you'll get at hotels on the strip. Free parking if you're renting a car. Free WiFi. Pool area is nicely treed, with areas to make both sun worshippers and albino's content. Negatives would be. Worn and dirty carpets in the hallways. TV only gets a half dozen channels. (But is a 42\" LCD.) Casino area is smokier than some of the finer establishments. Can only assume is due to an older ventilation system. If you're not renting a car, things could be a good hike away for you. It comes down to what you're looking for. If you love the glitz and glamour. Like the feeling of being treated like a millionaire and hobnobbing with the beautiful people. Don't go to Terribles. If you're willing to overlook minor deficiencies, and the fact a high percentage of patrons are missing body parts, to save a few bucks. I really do recommend checking it out. I'll be back for sure. The only thing that really sucks is the name of the place. \"You're staying where?!\" Hints: One Friday night there was a long line of people out front that had been waiting for cabs for awhile. I walked across the street to the gas station and flagged one down in under a two minutes. Make sure you actually pull shut the room door behind you as you leave. I've found on more than just one room that if you just let it swing closed it won't actually close and lock. As an aside, car rentals in Vegas can be cheap if done right. I paid $160 (taxes in) for the week. Terribles isn't for everyone. But it's good enough for me and my beer budget.

Bus 202 will stop directly outside Caesar's Palace though it's frequency is only every 20-30 minutes. You may attempt to walk to the Strip but as I quickly found out, walking for 15-20 minutes in 110 degree heat is not so pleasant. It is walkable though, but I would only recommend doing so when the weather is cooler. The rooms were a nice surprise. It was spacious and rather classy. Mine was tastefully decorated with soft lighting and a rather large TV. I didn't like the fact that my room overlooked the parking lot but it was actually quiet and safe. The bathroom was rather cramped but usable. Staff were courteous even though they looked a little stoic. I checked in quickly with no problems. Their 24 hour cafe has a nice selection of foods that cater to various palates. i didn't get a chance to try out their breakfast buffet but that was due to the fact that I only had 5 days in Vegas and was eager to explore the city.

Since this was a Sunday through Thursday lodging situation, I knew I would get a better deal than the Friday/Saturday weekend traveler. So I went to good old tripadvisor to see what my fellow travelers were saying. In my offpeak lodging situation, I found Terrible's to be terrific. No gaming fee like a lot of the other properties charge, reasonable rates in line with - gasp! - Motel 6, and with better rooms than any Motel 6 could ever offer. I came to the front desk and told them what rate I would get if I booked with Hotels.com. They said they could not match that rate. I asked the clerk if they would be willing to drop their rate since I had the information and the technology available to me to get the rate I desired from Hotels.com. They declined - no harm, no foul. No problem - I merely walked back to my car for a private conversation with the Hotels.com customer service representative, and came back inside to the same desk clerk with the authorization number Hotels.com gave me. Of course, the number was not of use to Terrible's staff, and the reservation was not on their information system just yet. No problem. . . time for a little walk (it was early in the afternoon) and check out the corridors and rooms, and check out the elevators as to location. That done, I came back in a half hour's time to the front desk for the third time. This time the clerk (different one) saw I had a confirmed reservation in their system courtesy of Hotels.com. Good deal. It's so wonderful living in this Information Age, eh? (wink) I asked for quiet for a good night's rest and they put me on the third floor on the southeast corner area furthest from the casino floor. The elevators, by the way, are located at each corner where each inner hallway bisects the next hallway. These interior hallway elevators are also next to a bronze colored half circle trash can/cigarette ashcan. Yes, the doors are painted the same beige color as the guest rooms, but if one knows they are at the corners, it becomes fairly easy to locate them. The room was quite large. I had two queen beds, with a large flat screen television having basic cable channel lineup. Other pay to view programming and kid's electronic games were available at extra cost if desired, which I did not use. The mattress proved to be quite firm, a real plus. Pillows were large, fluffy and super comfortable. One was quite enough for me. Wow! The bathroom is very tastefully done in beige and rose colors, and there is ceramic tile for the bathroom floor. The sink has a very large mirror and has a coffeemaker for two servings of coffee, which I also didn't use, since I don't drink coffee. The ice container has both a bag and a lid, a plus. Free ice is available in the second and third floors in the southeast corners, which was close by to my room, and at the gift shop on the first floor. Ironing board and Iron are in each room. No microwave or refrigerator in standard rooms, though. For these one must get the upgraded room at extra cost. The dials for operating the heating and air conditioning system are not distinct, and so I made the mistake of setting the air conditioner to a higher than desired temperature level on the thermostat control knob. This resulted in me waking up in the middle of the night in a stuffy room (you cannot open the windows). Not to worry. . . I called the front desk and had the maintainance technician come to my room. I got a knock on my door in about one minute. He set the thermostat to the correct position, and all was well. I slumbered back to sleep, and enjoyed a good night's rest despite my mistake in operating the air conditioning system. Regarding safety: like all Las Vegas establishments of this type, there is security, and of course they patrol the parking lots. After 6:00 PM, the outside doors to the rooms away from the casino have locks so that only guests with a valid room card key may enter in. Of course someone with a valid card may allow others to enter in with them, etc. but a good thing I suppose to help keep out riffraff. Security cameras (or fakes) are installed at the entrances to the hallways. I felt safe in my room, but I did look out the window to check on my car and the parking lot below. . . but that's just me. This being Las Vegas, of course there were people dressed up to go to parties, etc. Did I see anything I don't normally see? Certainly. Would I regard my stay as family friendly? Because I minimized my time in the hallways, elevators, and *ahem* the casino, I would give a qualified yes. One doesn't really see children in a place like this - I didn't - , but by taking the kind of action I have described above, one can stay here with children if that's what you have to do. If I were with children, I would go to a place like Boulder City that doesn't have the casino element to it, though. Finally, an historical note: this property was known as the Continental Hotel and Casino in the mid 1990's. Not sure when Terrible's took it over and renovated it, but it sure looks a lot better - and is getting far more business - than the decrepit and moribund Continental, which eventually had to declare bankruptcy. Nice to see some successful turnarounds in the hospitality industry, as the old Continental was quite the dive when I first became acquainted with it years ago.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cUnprofessional\u201d", "Author": "Henry154914", "ReviewID": "UR107508287", "Content": "Stayed there in Feb. and March.

Took 2 minutes in the car and was actually better anyways, who wants to walk back to the hotel after a long day of walking everywhere anyway? I actually enjoyed being off the strip, it was way quieter and way cheaper. There are alot of restaurants in the area which is good too. The convenience store they have in the casino is perfect too, cheap with everything you need. Didn't gamble here so really can't speak on it but it's ok, has a bunch of slots, a few tables, bingo, and a sports book. Parking was easy and right outside my window.

I've stayed at approximately 10 different hotels in Vegas over the past four years at all levels from the ritziest to the cheapest and dollar for dollar this was the best. It is not a luxury hotel by any means, but at only $27 a night by far and away the best deal. The rooms are regular size with a large flat screen TV. There were only a limited number of channels, but if you're in Vegas to watch TV you need to have you're head examined. Anyway, the rooms were very clean and well maintained. Surprisingly, the beds, pillows and sheets were very high standard. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've had in Vegas. The bathroom was small but adequate. Housekeeping was very efficient and the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel had a nice small pool with some landscaping and lots of palm trees. Kind of like a miniature version of the pool at the Flamingo. The hotel does not have the dreaded \"resort fee\" that many hotels have, yet it had the extra's that these fees provide. This included free in room wi fi and free use of a small but adequately equipped exercise room. The casino was small but they had good blackjack rules. I did not eat at the buffet; I took a look at it and it didn't look very appetizing so I'm not sure I would recommend it. I did eat at the coffee shop and it was okay. In summary, I highly recommend Terrible's for people looking for a nice hotel who aren't interested in staying a mega resort/hotel, yet want to be close to the strip (a 15 minute walk) and want to save their money so they can lose it gambling.

I was here on business for a conference at UNLV. The conference was about a 20 minute walk, but so was the official conference hotel, and this was half the price. The casino was smoky, but not overwhelmingly so, and the room was clean and comfortable. The bed was new and it had a flat screen. One good thing was that the windows actually opened. Since it was October and cool out, this was quite nice. The cafe was good and cheap, and they had 24 room service, which was also quite inexpensive. 30 minutes or less, and none of those expensive \"service\" charges. Also an on-site convenience store had snacks and cheap drinks and beer. The pool was cold, but it was October, but the hot tube was nice, and the pool area was a great place to sit and socialize. The casino was mostly slots, but the tables were quite cheap - lots of $5 blackjack the weekend I was there. There was well run shuttle to the airport. Overall, the service was very good. I asked for an iron and extra lamp for my room, and they were delivered promptly, and everyone in the casino and restaurants were efficient and friendly. Location is \"off strip\" but it's walking distance to the Hard Rock, Hofbrauhaus, and a number of other restaurants, and a quick cab ride to the strip.

The check-in was fast and the desk person met all my requests, non-smoking, king size bed, refrigerator, and on the first floor or near an elevator. The room was much bigger than I expected. It was in the older part of the hotel but was very clean and fresh smelling. It had a 42\" flat screen TV mounted on the wall. I really liked the coffee maker in the room. I was able to get all my meals compted with my rate of play. Their generous point system with the club card added up so I was also able to bring home a number of souveniers from the gift shop. It was within walking distance from the strip but did not have all the traffic. Terrible's appeared to be a favorate of the locals, small but friendly. Locals can cash their pay checks there and earn gasoline, milk, cigarettes, kitchen utensils, tools or many other things in their point cataloge, not just touristy stuff. I felt the buffet was excellent with a different menu every night, heavy on Tex-Mex foods. The full service restaurant was good too. The staff were all very helpfull and cheerfull. One cocktail waitress remembered what I drink and brought me fresh ones, sometimes without me realizing she had been there, I would turn to my side and there would be a fresh drink. The pool was private from the public and was very nicely landscaped with lots of chairs, tables and umbrellas. What I really liked and rarely see was an outdoor hot tub that was really hot.

I booked one room a week before a huge basketball tournament in Vegas and needed somewhere off the strip, with a nice pool, with a fairly inexpensive room. I paid $413 for 6 nights. The pool was nice (could have been skimmed more frequently) and the room was cheap but small and had a smoky smell even tho it was a nonsmoking room. The bathroom was quite tiny and the shower did not work well. As other reviewers have mentioned the customer service is not top notch, however Matt at the front desk was very helpful on two occasions, and Greg in the cafe was the best server. Also, Alicia in housekeeping went the extra mile. Everyone else did their job and did smile or look like they were happy to be working. Oh well. I didn't expect much, and was pleasantly surprised at the three employees mentioned who were excellent. The location is OK, off the strip a little but you can walk to the strip if you are capable of withstanding the heat. We walked one day from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and saw the Flamingo, Caesar's, NY NY, MGM, Planet Hollywood. There is a mini mart/gas station across the street, a McDonald's and Starbucks down the road, PF Changs across the street, Hof Brau Haus a block away. The airport is very close, maybe a 5-10 min drive, depending on traffic. I CANNOT recommend this hotel to families, however. I HAD to stay there for the event, but I would not have wanted to be there with my husband and 5-year-old. There are a lot of hookers and partiers wandering the hotel. The ameneties listed on alaska airlines.com website are incorrect and misleading. There is no McDonald's on site, no laundry on site, no fitness center on site. If you are single, a smoker, like to gamble, like cheap eats (not great, but not horrible food), want some shade by the pool, then Terrible's will suit you fine.

We took the free shuttle from the airport (call from your cell phone or airport phone when you get in to LAS, it's by request only) and got to the hotel at 10am and we got our room no problem. Check in was pretty slow, but the girl was very nice. The room was a little outdated, but fairly clean. Nice beds, a 42\" flat screen TV and FAST free Wi-Fi were nice. Small bathroom and thin towels were prob my only complaints. Pool area was nothing special and definitely a little worn around the edges, nothing like the elitist, fancy Strip pools. This is where you come to drink $1.50 beers and kill some time. Nice view of landings into LAS airport too ;-) The hotel is a $10 cab ride from the Strip, or you can walk in about 15-20 mins. You can also walk to the Hard Rock which is across the street. One of the best reasons to stay here is the food. Their restaurant, Bouganvilla Cafe is a great choice for Vegas dining on a budget. Huge menu with great options. You'd be hard pressed to spend more than $10 per meal. The food is cheap and better than it has to be. Service differs, but who cares, it's still a great value. Check out their $9.99 steak and ribs special...most even come with a free beer! Also, the hotel has a 7/11 type convenience store on site with street prices...nothing is marked up like on the Strip. 24oz beers are $1.50 just like at the gas station across the street. They also have snacks, liquor, wine and souvenirs. We bought beer here and drank it out at the pool. I think I got significantly drunk for the same price as 1 beer at the pool at the MGM.

No ironing board but that was supplied when I asked. Free wi-fi, and it worked. Shops: The gift shop had a lot of stuff - from cigars to beer and wine - all at street prices. A bottle of beer that should cost $1.29 cost $1.29. In a casino hotel!!! Restaurant: Locals eat here. Huge plates. Low prices. Not gourmet fare, but I had a half-chicken and a side salad and it was $8. Services: Getting a taxi is tough, but you can walk over to the Hard Rock Hotel if you are getting no love.

As I am always on a budget, I monitored the room rates for months. The ones on the strip was ridiculously high as usual, but I noticed that there was a prominent drop in prices about a week before the event started. However, the prices were still higher than I wanted to pay. So I made a choice between two locations (Sams Town Hotel and Casino and Terribles Hotel and Casino) that I had visited before that I felt provided great value. Sam's Town is a great value at about $45 a nite for three nights. with very nice accommodations, but it was further out on Boulder Highway. Terribles Hotel at about $55 a nite was a bit closer to the strip and directly on the same street as the convention (still a 1.1 mile walk). Outside Appearance: Can't quite describe it other than to say it looks like a mix of cowboy and egyptian. Definitely an older building, but definitely not rundown in any way. There is parking in a garage, but I prefer parking in the regular lot for quick access to the rental car. Location: It is about a mile from the convention center and there are busses that run down that way. It is also about a mile from the strip down E. Flamingo Road to the Bellagio. A Bahama Breeze, PF Changs and a mexican chain restaurant are just across the street. Room: On the previous visit my wife and I got a magnificent room for the price in the tower (newer) building. On this visit I cut cost and asked for a standard room. I was surprised to find that it was almost as nice as the one we had before. Flat panel tv in the room, basic yet very nice decor, carpet was clean, furnishings were decent and not worn in any way. The bathroom was cleaned and well stocked and I was given a room facing the courtyard with the nice pool. I took a few pictures, which I accidently just deleted. The rooms used the key cards and I felt quite safe and comfortable in my room and at the hotel. Food: For some strange reason the breakfast buffet does not start until 9am, so I zipped on over to the Monte Carlo and had breakfast over there, because it has always been good. Extras: On my third day I skipped the convention and did a little sight seeing over to the Grand Canyon (one picture here). The hotel was nice enough to let me have a late check-out. That way when I got back I could just take another shower and head for the airport. Oh yes, they have free wireless (unsecured) and it was very fast. Terribles was still good on my 2nd time around. If it is full and you want to save money and you also have a rental car, Sams Town is a good alternative. One Thing: The hotel lobby is always very smoky!

So, I went on Expedia and found Terrible's. What really sold me was the free shuttle to and from the hotel. I think the few companies that run shuttles from the airport to the hotels are a rip-off, and cabs even more so. Upon arriving at the airport, it took me about a half an hour to find out where to pick up the shuttle (Level Zero, a floor BELOW Baggage Claim), but when I did, I was pretty blown away: a pimped-out stretch SUV limo painted bright red. And free bottled water inside! This is a wonderful touch, and Terrible's is to be commended for this. Once you arrive at the hotel, your expectations should be more in line with what to expect with this level of hotel. Check in was quick and easy, if a little brusque. The casino is smoky and crowded. The room was clean, but definitely showed its age. This hotel actually used to be a place called The Continental, and was reported to be a total dive. But the room was clean. The bathroom definitely was about as basic as you can get. A flat-screen TV was a nice touch. The room was quiet. Overall, I'd put this on level with an average or slightly below Motel 6. Terrible's Bougainville(?) coffee shop was a very good deal, though service was slow. For $21, this is a relative bargain, though I came at a really dead time of the year, the week of Christmas. If you are willing to spend an extra $15 for the night, you can get something significantly better...but will probably give up the free shuttle. It's also worth noting one other thing: I am by no means a snob; in fact, I avoid the Strip hotels because of all the posers staying there. That said, Terrible's seemed ripe with people more than a little down on their luck, and they seemed to wear that in their appearance. It's just a fact of staying at a place like this. Consider this: A round-trip on a regular airport shuttle will run you about $12; for an extra $9, you might get a clean bed to sleep in as well!", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrible's is not all terrible.\u201d", "Author": "Scoutiej", "ReviewID": "UR52052034", "Content": "Nice comfortable beds, a BIG plus.

We ate at the restaurant in the hotel on the first floor every day, the food and value for money was fantastic, the portion sizes were enormous, even at breakfast, for the price it couldnt be beat and the selection on the menu was the largest ive ever seen, a steak and egg breakfast would only cost us $5 and an evening meal you could easily eat for under $10. it was never busy and we got a table right away every time. They even have their own brand of Terrible Ketchup and brown sauce and Terrible wine. It was a good 15 minute walk to the strip which brought you out at Bills/Ballys, we got a cab a few times and was only $5 or so, especially late at night we didnt fancy the walk back, For an off strip hotel the distance wasnt too far i expected further. There is a walgreens or 7/11 i cant remember, right across the road where they sell beer and all the usual things, we would stock up our fridge in our room instead of buying things in the hotel during the day.

You can't find that in too many places on the Strip. The one weak link in the room is the bathroom, it is tiny. But when you are by yourself, that is really not an issue. (The tower rooms have larger bathrooms). I love the casino, it has all my favorite games. I cannot find Spin Poker on the Strip, Terribles must have a dozen of them. The pool is peaceful and relaxing. Go out anytime during the day and there is no problem finding a chaise in either the sun or shade. Cocktail service is abundant. The breakfast buffet is great; fresh waffles and an omlette station among other things. And during my time I earned enough points to pay for one night's accommodation and two meals. With taxes, I paid a tad less than $70 for the weekend. My friend's bill approached the $500 mark. If you don't have a car, you are looking at either a $1.75 bus ride, $10 taxi ride, or 1 mile walk to the Strip. (However, they do have a free airport shuttle.) You also get the ambience of locals casino which means a little less bling and a bit more smoke. But all in all it adds to the experience. I love this place and will continue to come here for great gambling and unprecedented value.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "GlasgowSteve", "ReviewID": "UR30710357", "Content": "This was our 4th time in vegas 1st time off the strip.We stayed on the3rd floor not a tower room which was big and clean.[so no need to upgrade to a tower room].

I have stayed in the older rooms since they are so inexpensive. The rooms are clean albeit older. The pictures shown by the property are of the newer, tower rooms. The older rooms look similar to the tower rooms but are not as up-to-date. The tub looks older. The Bouganvillea Cafe is extremely smokey as is the buffet area.

Don't let looks deceive you. Although you can see the Flamingo, it takes about 30 minutes to walk up there. You will arrive by the Flamingo, Ballys, Caesars and the Bellagio. We usually cab back. You can walk across the street to the Hard Rock Cafe and take the free shuttle to the MGM grand. The shuttle runs every 30 minutes or so. Terrible's also has a free shuttle to and from the airport. If you cab from the airport to Terrible's, it is less than a 5 minute ride. Do not let the cabbie take you on the Freeway down to the strip. You should by-pass the strip completely. Oh, and the cab fares are based on TIME not distance! If you are looking for cheap food/drink on the strip, there is a CVS, McDonalds, Chipotle across from the Mirage and a Walgreens up by the M-n-M factory across from New York New York. Within walking distance of Terrible's you will find Bahama Breeze, PF Changs and Cozymel's restaurants. All are tasty but can be a bit pricey.

I checked in on 10/31/08 and checked out on 11/2/08. (Problem #1) The check in process was a bit slow, I presented my id and credit card to the rep, little did I know that she was going to authorize a $240.00 hold on my credit card for just for a 2 nite stay, when I had already paid for the first night. I did not find this out until I was signing the paperwork, I questioned this and I was told that this was a security deposit and that any unused funds would be refunded to me at checkout. I understood, however I just wish that the rep had warned me in advance about this because now I had alot less available credit to use on my trip. (Problem #2) went up to the 5th floor where my new tower room was, after about 20 mins. of getting settled in and unpacking I come to find out the toilet would not flush. I went downstairs and waited in line for at least 15 mins just to complain about this, when I reached the front desk, the staff was friendly about the complaint and immediately gave me a different room on the 4th floor. The new tower room itself was very nice, clean, and modern, comfy beds, a nice window view, a huge flat screen tv (which only gets about 5 channels), coffee maker, and iron / board upon request. (Problem #3) On Sunday 11/2/08 a couple hours before checkout, I found that my shower was getting no hot water, most likely due to several other guests taking showers at the same time. (Other Comments) I did order a steak dinner for a good price in the upstairs restaurant, it was very good and the waiter was very friendly. As for the Casino, I must say that on the weekend I visited, Terrible's sure had some very tight paying machines which did nothing but take, take, take and not give anything in return.

We were looking for a hotel for one night to lay our heads before we headed over to the Summerlin area where we were spending most of our time. I got a great rate on the www.travelnow.com website. They seem to have the cheapest rates for Vegas hotels, and believe me, I scour them all! I got a $39 + tax rate which included $25 in slot play and a free breakfast buffet. I was very pleased with my rate. Just because I have heard of people not getting what they are supposed to get I made sure to print out the page from TravelNow's website that showed what I was supposed to get with that promotion. Fortunately I did not need that paper but I was glad I had brought it anyways just in case! We arrived at Terrible's about 1030PM on a Thursday night. When I had made my reservation I had requested a smoking room with king bed. I had even called the hotel to reiterate my requests. By the time I checked in neither of those requests were available- i was given a non-smoking room with 2 double beds. The only requests that were honored were a room on the ground floor and near the casino entrance. When I got to my room and found out it was 2 beds nonsmoking I called the front desk and was told there was nothing else avaiable. I decided not to fight it since I was only going to be there for one night and it was already practically bedtime. However, if I was supposed to stay for more than 1 night I would have gone back to the front desk and made sure that I got what I wanted or else got moved to what I wanted the next day. But one night? I could survive! The room was fine for one night. Nothing fancy, very basic. I think it was one of the recently renovated rooms. It was rather small, it had a 42\" TV on the wall, 2 double beds, an air conditioner that kept the room nice and cold, a vanity area and a tiny bathroom with toilet and tub. I was a little scared by the bathtub as there was no rubber bathmat or grab rails and I am always afraid of slipping in the tub. Fortunately I didn't. The bed was comfortable enough although the foam rubber pillows were not to my liking. The water in the shower was hot and had good pressure and checking in and out were a breeze. The buffet breakfast that came with the room was fine. Great waffles, plenty of choices, even a guy making eggs & omlets. Terrible's is one of my favorite casinos in Las Vegas - i like the smallness and the slot machines that they offer. I always rent a car when in Vegas and love Terrible's location & new parking garage. Would I return? Perhaps for one night but not for much longer.

Frankly, the only reason why I was even booked here is because it was close to the facility that my class was being held at AND there were little to no rooms available due to several other big ticket items going on in town during the same week. The facility is situated in a complicated manner. Once I managed to find the front desk, I asked if there was internet service. (Work.) I was told yes, all I had to do was to hook-up, but that it wasn't wireless. Once I was pointed in the \"general\" direction of the elevator (I discovered 4 days later there was a closer one.) I went to my room. The flat screen TV is the only nice thing about that room. EVERY night I was awakened by the thumping sound of car stereos as people were dropped off and picked up from their shifts, and layed listening to tour busses idling just below my window. About the only thing louder was the air conditioner so I left it on every night. The bed was hard and uncomfortable and the sheets had the thickness of a new sheet and the crispness of a pizza box. The rooms are small and cramped and the bathroom is tiny. I had to request clean glasses every day but was left so many plastic glasses daily that by the end of the stay I had accumulated over 28 unopened ones. 4 days after my arrival I logged on to my laptop to and couldn't get a line out. Come to find out, they shut it off because I had drummed up over 400.00 in charges on their \"internet service.\" Being a buisness traveler it never occured to me that they were charging me for a long distance call whenever I logged on. Nor was I informed of that when I specifically inquired at check in. Nor was it listed on my paperwork. NOR was it detailed in the room. ANYWHERE. The manager wouldn't talk to me about it. I called the desk and let the clerk know of my position. I asked why on their nightly reports, somebody didn't find it strange and speak up the first night? To wait 4 days? It wasn't until I was prepared to pay at my checkout that I had discovered the reduced the bill by 1/2. Not good enough in my opinion but I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth, either. I travel for work several times a year and I've never stayed anywhere they charge for internet service. If your looking for an inexpensive place to stay for a \"Vegas vacation\" and can withstand the trade-off of noisy inconsiderate people, and less than friendly desk staff, go for it.

If you have to pay more (on weekdays) there are other options like Gold Coast of Orleans which give more value for your bucks. Location: This hotel is located within walking distance of the Strip with Hard Rock hotel on the other end of the street. Parking is easy and a hike to your room, like in many other hotels, is not neccessary. Now they have the new parkinggarage, it's easy to park late in the evening as well. Hotel: Nice theme, clean and comfortable. They cleaned the walls in the hallways as well as the carpets (at least on the ground floor) so it all looked fresh and clean. Checking in was always quite easy with just a little wait. Staff could be more friendly and because the reception is located in the casino prepar for a somewhat smokey wait. Rooms: They have a new tower wit brand new rooms, but they are not a bargain anymore. The older rooms are still clean, larger than average and updated to modern standards with new furniture in some rooms and a 42inch plasma tv. Not really neccessary for me because the few channels they have were of poor (noisy) quality. Ice manchine's are located in some corners of the hallways, but not on every floor so you might end up hiking through the hotel. Food: If you are on a budget, this hotel buffet is great. 2 for 1 coupons are to be found under your pillow and you can eat for next to nothing. The food's quality is ok (fresh waffles and eggs cooked to order) and for paying only half the regular price it's a great deal. We found, though, that the quality of the food has gone done a little and weekend brunch is not more than a change to raise their price (which is something most hotel buffets do lately) We didn't eat in the cafe, so we don't know about that one. In the little shop they have coffee and a (fresh) Krispy kreme donut for 1 dollar. Pool area: This place is . A little oasis of trees and flowers with a nice shaped pool (cold water) and a large hottub. It's nice place to relax with plenty of seats. On some fridays they have a pool party which is free for women. They have music in the afternoon, which makes it even more relaxing. Casino: Though we never had much luck here this is the place to get a players card and earn those points for free food and other goodies. They have triple points on thrusdays and sundays. The casino is cramped though and i guess the casino's on the strip are much nicer to have a great evening out. Shuttle: they provide a shuttle service, but we don't have a good experience with it.

I got fooled right there! Maybe they got so much confidence in their standard rooms they would think I'd assumed it as renovated! That's being dishonest! The halls and elevators are rather dingy, as said by another poster. The room I had however is clean, decent and larger than your average motel 6. The bathroom is average just like in Motel 6. There's a coffeemaker in the room. If not for staff dishonesty, I would have given this hotel a higher rating. We tried the Cafe, the portions were huge, the biggest pancakes I've had in my life.

Didn't try the buffet because i wanted to try the best ones on the Strip, although you get a 241 coupon when you sign for a players card, also they give you a free shirt!

We chose the latter. Our flight landed at 11 pm, and we checked in at 11:30 pm. The next day, we checked out and switched to the MGM Grand. Terrible's had decent reviews on this website so we decided to go with it. Got a very good price which also included the free all-you-can-eat breakfast. For what we paid, it was an amazing deal. Check-in was slow. No one was at the counter for 15 minutes (though I note we arrived at 11:30 pm), which was very frustrating. Our room was very big, with a nice 42\" plasma tv and a large bed. It was clean but you can tell that at one point someone smoked in it (we are non-smokers), but it wasn't too bad. The bathroom was tiny. Considering we crashed when we got there so we could get an early start the next morning, we had no problems with this room at all. Terrible's is about a mile from the strip. I couldn't find the bus stop and taxis don't queue in front of the hotel like the others...they are only there unless they drop someone off. There is a person who will try to flag down cabs, but they don't come by often.

There is a computer for the guests to use located in the exercise room (no printer located at the computer). Unlike most of the strip hotels, it is completely free. Terrible's is considered a locals hotel and casino and therefore gears its pricing to the Vegas residents. The hotel gift shop has some of the best sundries prices I have seen in Vegas. They're comparable to and in some cases lower than convenience store prices. Bottled water was the best of all, with bottles carrying the Terrible's name selling for $.25 each. Terrible's also has a very generous slot club and you are able to accumulate points not only for playing their slots, but also for gift shop purchases and for purchases (including gas) made at one of Terrible's convenience stores in the Vegas area. The breakfast buffet is nothing to rave about. Good, but average food and a decent number of menu items to select from. However, the price definately makes it worthwhile. Though the property is a ways off the strip, it can be walked and there is a city bus running past the hotel to the strip on a regular basis.

Here are my impressions: The hotel is relatively small (about 400 rooms), and so it\u2019s easy to get back and forth to your room. Rarely was anyone else on the elevator with me. The room itself is fine \u2013 nothing special, but certainly adequate (I was in the new portion of the hotel). The biggest shortcoming, and potentially a reason not to stay at the hotel, is that the air conditioning unit is extremely loud, and shuts on and off every 5-7 minutes. I was able to sleep through it, but when you\u2019re just in the room, it\u2019s quite annoying. And if you\u2019re watching TV, it means you\u2019re constantly adjusting the volume. Perhaps not an issue when it\u2019s not hot outside, but when I was there it was around 100 degrees. One other thing \u2013 the hallways were, inexplicably, scorching (like 90 degrees). They seemed to have the heat on full blast, even though it was the dead of summer. As for location, the walk to the Strip is 20-25 minutes (depends on your pace). It seems closer than it is, and it\u2019s not a particularly pleasant walk, as you walk by a bunch of lots that are either vacant or abandoned (or some combination of the two). You do end up at Bally\u2019s, where you can get on the Monorail. Closer is the Hard Rock (probably a 10 minute walk). The taxi situation is somewhat hit or miss. The front desk told me they can\u2019t call for one, and you must go to the front of the hotel and ask a valet to call for you. Don\u2019t try picking one up on the street, as it\u2019s against the law for them to pick you up. I had them call once, and then someone was being dropped off, so I just jumped in that one, and thus don\u2019t know how long it would normally take for one to show up. There\u2019s no wireless Internet access, and the business center is nothing more than a simple computer, with no USB drives or anything (it\u2019s also located in the exercise room). If you want to print something, it prints at the front desk. This would potentially be a big problem, but there\u2019s a 24 hours Kinko\u2019s that you can walk to in about 3 minutes. I only at the restaurant once, and it was breakfast. But there\u2019s a lot to like about being able to order 3 big pancakes for $2.99. When people ask you where you're staying, it is amusing to see their reaction when you tell them the name of the hotel is \"Terrible's.\" Few people, other than cabdrivers, seem to know it.

We were very pleased with our stay at Terrible's. We were in the new tower and the beds are the most comfortable of any hotel I have ever stayed in. The huge flat screen TV is very nice, although we did not watch much television. We had a view of the pool and I love the fact that you can open your sliding window. I think it is the only hotel in Vegas you can do this. When we were there it was too hot (117) to even think of opening a window, but it would be very nice to have the option in a cooler season. The pool looked nice with a tropical setting of palm trees and plenty of lounge chairs, but I did not want to be in the heat, and I do not go to Vegas to swim. The rooms are standard with a nice bathroom, king bed, table with 2 chairs and dresser. They do have a coffee maker and for me that is a big plus, I hate having to go down to the casino in the morning for my first cup of coffee!! We had no problem with the maid service, as someone stated in another review. My husband had dropped his change by the bed and when we came back it was sitting on the nightstand. I also did not see any bugs of any kind in the hotel. I loved the fact that you need your room key to use the elevator, no key and the elevator will not go up. The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the airport and they have a gym and internet access on the second floor. The staff at the front desk saved us the hassle of going upstairs and printed our boarding passes for us. If you want to go to the strip and do not have a car there is a bus stop across the street and it drops you off by Caesars and you catch the bus back by Bally's. The bus back stops right in front of the hotel. As for the casino, it is smaller than the strip casinos but has the best comps I have seen. They offer double and triple points on certain days and you can gets different gifts, buffets or spend it in the store, I am not a big gambler, I do mostly penny and nickel slots. We were there for 5 days and spent maybe a 1/4 of our time in Terrible's and still had $75.00 in comps between the 2 of us to spend in the store. They were also doing a free cruise to Mexico with a drawing every Friday night.

If you stay there, make sure you sign up to their Player's Club - the points you collect while using the slots can be used to pay for food, drinks, stuff from the gift shop, you name it. We hardly spent anything apart from in the Casino. The Casino itself is not huge, but has a good range of slots and tables. The cocktail waitresses were very friendly and came round quite often.

Their Chinese food is some of the best I have had and I go to Chinatown in NYC all the time, plus have been to Chinatown in San Francisco. They have excellent Mexican Food.

We can indeed confirm that Terribles isn't terrible. However it wasn't much more than simply adequate. Our experience at the hotel clearly defies in many ways the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Pros: Affordable budget hotel in a good location. Plentiful parking. Safe and convenient. On-site convenience store and gambling. Lots of restaurants and retail establishments around. Staff was generally professional and polite. Cons: Our room was old and tired. Tight vanity area with super-small unappealing bathroom. Malfunctioning shower head and smeared gnats on ceiling. Smelled of old smoke. Few TV channels with snowy pictures. Cafe was hit or miss. Buffet was absolutely awful for breakfast and dinner. No internet service (no wireless and we were told hotel does not provide computer access). Advice: Call hotel in advance before booking room to ensure that you can lock up a non-smoking room. Request newer part of hotel. Inspect room on arrival. Smell smoke? See dead/live bugs? Bathroom clean and functioning? Avoid the buffet and temper expectations with cafe. Book this hotel at a rate you love, follow our advice, and you will make a good choice by choosing Terribles. Our story: We called the hotel in advance to confirm our reservation and to notify them that we would be arriving late due to our flight. The Terrible's employee verified our info and made note that we would be checking in late. We also wished to verify that we had a non-smoking room. The employee informed us that they hand out rooms at the time of check-in so no guarantees could be made. This was disappointing to hear as we had booked our room online as a non-smoking room. We used a travel website, so perhaps Terribles isn't as much to blame for the confusion. Ultimately, they indeed had a non-smoking room available for us even in arriving just before midnight. This was useful info though as we would be hesitant to book a stay at a hotel where we weren't guaranteed a non-smoking room. After check-in the elevator whipped us up to the third floor where we found our room with no problem. Ours was adequate in size outside of a very tiny bathroom (which had other issues though besides being cramped.) The bathroom didn't appear to be very clean, but that may have had more to do with it's age than any fault of the maid. The shower head was also malfunctioning, but we dealt with it. We did find a live ant or two in the bathroom as well. But the greatest wonder were the dozen crushed gnats on our ceiling. Since we didn't notice this until the near the end of our stay we decided not to mention it. (Perhaps we failed our civic duty to report such issues, but we didn't feel like having that conversation with management.) The vanity area was also pretty tight which made storage of toiletries a little bit of a challenge. The plus side to our room came when (much to our surprise) we noticed that we had a nice big flat panel TV on our wall. However there were few channels to watch and half of those were snowy. The beds were decent though nothing more. Our room faced the parking lot, but there wasn't much of a noise issue as we kept the fan/AC running. Although we received a non-smoking room, my wife noticed the smell of old smoke and we both had respiratory issues which we wonder if our room played a role in. In retrospect we should have complained about our room, but we didn't notice all of these issues at once. They built up over time and we were resigned to dealing with the hand we were dealt. We appeared to be in an older portion of the hotel, so this might explain many of our issues. Perhaps it would behoove you to ensure that you don't wind up where we did. On our first morning, we tried the cafe for breakfast. The pancakes with blueberries were good. The fruit cup was also fine. The meal was a decent value and we felt it was the healthiest thing on the menu. The service was good that morning. We tried their rotisserie chicken for dinner the next night. What a laugher...especially if you happen to catch the ad for it in the elevator or on the hotel's TV channel. Of course it looked great in the ads. And for $4.99 who wouldn't at least give it a shot? We found the chicken to be extremely bland and boring. It also came with tasteless corn, rice, & refried beans. Complimentary stale bread rounded out our meal. Not a very good dining experience. But it certainly retaught me the lesson about getting what one pays for. When considering that fact, I don't hold the meal against them. It was big enough for two and it was cheap. The service was very slow and unattentive, but it was 10:00 at night and they were busy. We tried their buffet for breakfast and dinner on separate days. Like other reviewers say 2-1 coupons are a plenty. If you end up paying full price then you are getting a bum deal. In fact, we found the buffet to be a ripoff even with the discount. Overall the food was more disgusting than delicious. Though we are not big fans of buffets we found theirs to be one of the worst the two times that we tried it. Like the chicken, it's a great value (w/ coupon) but you risk sacrificing all quality and taste. There were positives to our stay at Terribles. There was plenty of parking. The hotel is in a nice location. Traffic can be a nightmare during peak times, but we found it to be a breeze otherwise. Road construction is going on south of the hotel so you may wish to add another 5 minutes to your travel time estimates when going to & fro. The strip is a good walk away so we decided to drive to a free parking lot (I believe it is a convention center next to the Tropicana). That lot is at the very south end of the strip so it may not be a good idea to park there if your business or pleasure is to be had further noth. The hotel has a nice little convenience store inside and we found the prices to be reasonable. There are also grocery stores, drug stores, restaurants, and retail establishments nearby in case you have additional needs. We were in Vegas for the Vegoose concert at Sam Boyd stadium. It took us about 20-25 minutes to get to the stadium during the weekend. Before we book another stay with Terribles hotel we would likely exhaust other suitable options. If we ended up coming back it wouldn't strike fear in us, but we would certainly keep our expectations low. It is a decent budget hotel, but during our stay we found it to be nothing more.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "gahanna, oh", "Title": "\u201cTerrible's Not terrible\u201d", "Author": "reverendfig", "ReviewID": "UR6006108", "Content": "The first stay at a new place can be frightening and or terrible.

The hours are also reasonable by Vegas standards 8AM til 10PM. Being so close to the airport you could watch all the jets coming in for a landing as you cooked in the desert sun. I found the best prices for beer and wine in the small convenience store adjacent to the casino (and pool). Better prices than Wal Mart on Schlitz beer if you can believe it!

The buffet however was quite limited even compared to say the golden nugget downtown but still had all the basics. Quite a deal if you use the 2 for 1 coupons which are easy to come by. On the down side, I did notice the elevator and hallways were looking very tired and in need of new carpet and a fresh coast of paint but renovations were underway and may include these items. The cleanliness overall was not up to par with other hotels and, of course there was the everpresent cigarette smoke, with some guest's inconsiderately smoking everywhere, even in the elevators!

We had read reviews that said it was clean and we found it to be both clean and neat. True, the carpets are very faded and need replacing, but then this isn't an expensive hotel on the strip; more like a regular hotel. There is a new tower under construction, so newer rooms will be available in a few months. The older area is about 10 years old. The pool area is nice, but the hot tub wasn't very hot nor did it have bubbles. It is a good half hour walk to the Strip, but we had a car this time and the outdoor parking is very easy at this hotel. It is located at the intersection of Paradise and Flamingo, two big streets, close to the airport. Rooms - The room was large, with 2 queen beds, TV dresser, alcove to hang clothes, 2 arms chairs and a small table. The bed was quite comfortable. The TV only had about 12 stations but they included sports, news, and entertainment channels. The maid service was good and she replaced any shampoo bottles we had used (sometimes even expensive hotels won't do that). Food - The breakfast buffet was really good. It is only $5 a person and surprisinly large with an omlette bar, real ham with the bone (not lunchmeat ham), pastries, juice, coffee and most items you would expect on any breakfast bar. We ate there every morning. You can get a two-for-one ticket for any buffet (except the seafood on Thursday night) by joining the players club. We ate the buffet supper one night and it was just a regular buffet but it doesn't cost much either. We ate in the Bouginvilla Cafe twice and the service was extremely slow both times, but the food was fairly good. I liked the chicken friend steak. Gambling -Comps seem to be good, but confusing. This is pretty much a local place and the comps are complicated. designed for you to keep coming back and checking their specials. We found them to be confusing and the players club staff weren't very forthcoming about how the various systems work, but we got a few comps anyway, including $5 in free gas. Points can be restricted (which must be used within one week, so don't wait too long to go check on them and redeem them) and anytime points. The points on your card do NOT reflect the way the points are awarded and the day of the week matters, so go check. Also check everyday specials or you will miss them. This hotel needs to print out their policies, but probably don't because locals learn them and interim visitors don't know how to take advantage of them. In general, we enjoyed our stay here and felt like we could do some other things because the cost of the room was so reasonable.

I live in LA and drive to Las Vegas. I don't care to pay through the nose for a room that I will basically occupy about 20% of the time.

However, I feel that they really do come through with value. One of the best features of this property is their breakfast buffet which can be had for under $3.00 with coupon and a second person. Fabulous value. Good food, great selection, decent service. During the warmer months, the pool, though not exciting, is very quiet and relaxing. I imagine that children would, however, get bored and restless their. It's a good place to spend a few hours reading a good book. The gambling is average. It would be nice to have a few $1.00 blackjack tables. But that seems to be almost extinct in Las Vegas. It just seems like the atmosphere is very friendly and cozy in the casino. Maybe, that's because it isn't so huge like the strip propeties. If the accomodations seem less than festive, keep in mind that you are free to roam all over Las Vegas and that most of your time will not be spent in the room.

The hotel has a small but adequate swimming pool, but they do not provide beverage service at the pool. The buffet provides variety and value, as does the coffee shop.

The strip is about 1.5 miles, so if ya walk, be healthy. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel, which is cheaper then a cab, so I suggest that if you want to hit the strip.

However, having read some of the utterly negative reviews here, I was utterly dreading it. It\u2019s been made to sound like a cross between the Bates Motel and a Victorian Prison. The idea of creepy crawlies in the rooms was not something I relished. (I saw none by the way). There was a guy having an altercation with the desk clerk when we arrived and, we thought, this did not bode well. When the manager stepped in, she dealt with us and our check-in went smoothly. We asked for a smoking room (ground floor only) with courtyard view and she obliged. We usually lodge with Best Western when touring the US and this room was on a par with these \u2013 basic, clean accommodation. Our room was on the farthest side from the casino, adjacent to the fire station, but we never heard them. There is/was major construction work going on at the hotel (when isn\u2019t there in LV) but we experienced no noise or disturbance from them, certainly never early morning. The pool area was lovely. Granted, the pool furniture was dusty due to the construction work, but there were plenty of towels available to lie on or wipe down the loungers (or perhaps some people wouldn\u2019t demean themselves with such a menial task). With regard to the food, we could not fault the Bougainvillea Caf\u00e9. The Chinese lunch special I had (Hong Kong Chow Mien) was superb, as were hubby\u2019s chimichangas. On the two occasions we ate there we were able to take food away with us (and we could both eat for Wales). Tried the buffet and also found it, for the price, as good as many others we have eaten at in LV. There were plenty of offers such as 2 for 1 buffets if you joined the players club (which we didn\u2019t).

You can get a 24 hour pass for $5.00 which you can use to take you anywhere on the extensive transit bus system (which we do a lot).

It's cheap and also if your a senior you can get a discount card and ride for only $.60. Also for senior that don't like to commute Terribles is perfect because everything is there. Gambling, food, entertainment,and if you need some quiet time- outside in the garden. Also the FREE shuttle! My aunty who is 80 yrs. old loves Terribles and is happy to spend her whole vacation in the hotel. The only thing negative I have to say is with check in and check out.

(We booked for 6 nights and 7 days) When I booked I requested confirmation to be emailed - never sent - had to call three days later to confirm our reservations where confirmed. I tried to give the desk clerk our confirmation number and she would not take the information. Terrible's has been sending me emails for almost a year to give them a try and we did. What my wife and I observed was if you are an employee of Terrible's you get special treatment. What happened to taking care of your customer? I must say the room we finally got was nice, the only issue we had was a bottle of water was stolen - yes it was a small item - but it was someone stealing from a paying guest - we did not push the issue till we got home because of staying in casino 7 days and didn't want anymore problems. I must also state that the casino did offer at no charge a safety depost box which we did use, and what was nice was there was room enough to put my labtop in for security. Terrible's Buffet for what you pay with the 2 For 1 Coupon you cann't beat the price. However; back to the service issue with the casino. We went twice for the buffet and if you were an employee - or a family member of an employee you get special treatment over paying casino guest. Both times we went for the buffet we had people walk in and take a table of their choice without being taken to their table. When I questions what was going on I was ignored. Also when we finally got into the buffet and trying to get our food, employee's were rude and would force their way in line to get what food they wanted. Employee's seem to forget they are in a business that provides service for paying customers. As for the Bougainville Cafe in Terrible's which is open 24 hours - for get the concept of service. The first night we tried their dining - the food was great but their was no service. The second time we tried their dining - food was just ok, but they were consitant on \"no service\". On our second visit we did observe two tables request the manager and send food back and a third table was upset about something and left. My wife said it best - when the waiter/waitress went through the back door/kitchen door they went into \"never - never land\" because they never came back. Terrible's for what you are paying is not a bad thing on your pocket book, but if you are expecting service you might want to look into a diffent location, because what happened to use was very disappointing.

We had chosen the last night here for several reasons - one was the fact that this was video keno heaven where 90% of the machines were keno. We weren't going into this with the wool over our eyes and realized that the somewhat sleeziness would mean the rooms weren't going to be 4 star ones. Having said that, there were surprises and disappointments. The biggest surprise was that this hotel offered the only in-room coffee makers on our entire trip. The disappointments were many....from trash still laying around, to a bathroom door that gave us problems, to smelly bedspreads and to the realization that smoking rooms were on the first floor which may be fantastic for going to your room from the casino area, but for 3 women, it didn't make you feel very good. One problem is there is so much riff raff (i.e., we saw two different fights on the casino floor), and no security to make sure that people don't wander from the casino to the hotel rooms. The other problem was that the window in the room faced the walkway around the swimming pool. Low to the ground, we were forced to keep the curtains tightly closed to avoid people looking in at us. But if you want video keno, this is a great place to play. It's also a great place to earn nice gifts. If you want to play roulette or craps...forget it as they only have one table for each. Food to me is excellent!!! A small buffet with well prepared items was available but we spent most of our time in the cafe. Why? The simple answer is Bread Pudding. I admit it....I'm addicted and I use my Vegas trips as an excuse to eat the stuff. And Terribles so far, is the Bread Pudding KING.

Our room was spacious and clean, and nothing fancy, but we were only looking for basic comfortable. With an ironing board & iron, and a blow dryer, we had our needs easily met. The pool area was very nice with lots of trees and a jacuzzi. It was kept very clean, too. The casino was right up our alley. Lots of the popular slots, and the usual gaming tables.

The front desk was a nice gentleman when we checked in, but when we checked out there was a very rude and lazy girl who didn't speak but just kept doing what she was doing and \"pointed\" to the shuttle desk - never even bothering to look at or pick up our room keys. No one else was at the desk at the time - so she wasnt' busy by any means. At the bar, we sat to play some video poker and found the game and counter covered with dried food drippings and ashes. When we asked the bartender if we could get it cleaned, he handed me a rag and said \"I just can't keep up\" and then went back to his off duty friends telling 20 minute stories about fishing [really got tired of the word \"flounder\" after about 5 minutes!] We moved and a second bartender was much more friendly and clearly did not fit in to this hotel's less-than-low-budget atmosphere. The bar's idea of \"sports-bar\" was to show wrestling - really bad wrestling - that even the nice bartender couldn't stop watching and thought was \"great.\" Finally, in the room, they have window-type air conditioners which are left \"off\" until you check in. You have to turn it on and then get out until it cools down. In the evening when we went to sleep, we were awakened every hour on the hour by the airconditioner's extremely loud 'recycling-type' noise. Even the pillow on the head did not help. Worst night's sleep I've had in a long time. I asked another guest that morning if his airconditioner did the same thing, and he said he was also awakened every hour with this horrible noise. Needless to say, I would only recommend this hotel to someone I did not like and would never see again.

While it is not right on the strip, a quick 5 minute drive down to the Flamingo ramp puts you right at the strip.

We checked into our room and I wanted to take a shower....I start the shower and first there was no hot water...second the shower itself didn't work...there was mold on the ceiling holes in the wall of the bathroom. I spoke to the front desk and the offered to move us to a different room...with children already in bed asleep, we had to wait until the next morning. The second room was much better and I was much happier....Pool and hot tub are great.....quiet and secluded, but if you are looking for a quiet qetaway, do not stay there on a thursday night....Players club pool parties!!! Loud music, people screaming...the only place in the entire hotel you can get away from that noise is the casino which by the way is kinda small, but to go to the casino to get away from the noise of the pool party is pretty much hopeless. The location was kind of disappointing...according to the hotel staff when the room was booked...the hotel was supposed to be a block or two off the strip...NOT TRUE...it is actually about a five minute drive by car to the strip. I was not happy with this hotel at all....I had a better time the last time I was there and stayed at the Circus Circus.", "Date": "July 11, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Terrible's Hotel & Casino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d224849-Reviews-Terrible_s_Hotel_Casino-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$30 - $80*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4100 Paradise Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "224849", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9d/73/9d73d3190fbdf07013c6a621eb7f91174large.jpg"}}
