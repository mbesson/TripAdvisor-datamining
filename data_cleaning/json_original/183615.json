The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. The elevators are small and slow but I didn't spend any time waiting or being crowded. The hotel is/has been undergoing renovations. I was on a recently renovated floor. My room was upgraded to a king studio suite, a large room, very comfortable king bed with nice bedding, large windows with view of downtown, comfortable desk/workstation and sofa. There was a little nook kitchenette behind folding doors equipped with the basics, dishes, etc. Included was an older stove & fridge combo - worked perfectly, microwave and a sink. There was also a small table and chairs in the room and large, flat screen TV on a wall mounted arm to allow for viewing from the sitting area or bed, very convenient. The bathroom was smallish but clean and functional. I was disappointed with the room lighting, tended to be dark at night even with all lights on, not the best for reading.

We stayed at this property one night in January 2012 while visiting relatives in Montreal. We arrived at the hotel around 9pm on a Saturday night and left at 9am the following morning.

It is an excellent choice, if one is touring the city. Let me first set out the positive features of the property, then I will highlight the few negative aspects. The room was clean, and much to our surprise, had a full kitchen, including a full size fridge and stove + microwave oven. Our room had two double beds. They were memory-foam mattresses and were one of the most comfortable we've ever slept on. The bathroom was clean, and there were sufficient toiletries. On the negative side, the furniture and carpets were somewhat tired. Clearly, the entire hotel needs a renovation. The TV is not flat-screen, but rather a cathode ray picture. But, it is a large screen and it worked well. The bathroom needs sprucing up. The fixtures are old style. Clean, but old style! But, let me stress again that the hotel is very clean and neat. Parking was $20 plus tax for the night and it is valet parking, where one must surrender the car key to the attendant. I don't like that, but that is only a personal peeve. We had limited interactions with hotel staff. Check in was fast and pleasant, and staff were helpful. The clerk offered us information about Montreal, but as ex-Montrealers, we did not need a map, etc. We booked this hotel via booking.com and it was a special deal at $90 plus tax.

So we required a \"homebase\", we needed a hotel room with a seperate bedroom so we could put the baby to bed and still have a life after 8pm. We also needed a kitchen since our little guy doesn't eat much at restaurants. After a lot of internet research, we decided on this hotel. We LOVED it. Spending the extra bucks for the one-bedroom suite was sooo worth it. The decor was outdated but the room was clean and we do believe it was bigger than our actual house! We had a seperate bedroom with 2 queen beds, a walk-in closet and a decent sized flat screen tv. The floor to ceiling windows had views to die for! Coming into the room the bathroom was on the left, it was your typical hotel restroom, nothing special, but very clean! Then walking past that, there were 2 double closets, then you walk into the living/dining room area to your right or open the door and go into the bedroom on your left. The dining room had a small dining room table with 4 chairs and a lamp. There was also a large closet-which SURPRISE was actually a kitchen! It was actually larger then we thought it would be. It had a full stove/oven, full sized fridge with freezer, sink, microwave, toaster, kettle, pot/pans, cutlery, china, glasses, can opener etc. Everything you would need! The living room was very large, with a pull out couch (which we never used) and an armoire with the smallest TV I had ever seen, possibly from 1982. (It seemed odd that the better TV was in the bedroom?) The TV was so small and old and dark we could not read the subtitles! Being in Quebec and not speaking french, this really sucked!!! The living room also had huge windows and a writing desk. The whole hotel had an Old Montreal feel, brass elevator included. We really liked the old school feel but if you are looking for modern, crisp style, this hotel is not for you. But we figured that since we were staying in Old Montreal, we should stay in a place like this. We really liked the location. It was close to shopping, bars, restaurants, subway, etc. The hotel has valet parking for $25 a day. Yes, pricey but we liked the easy access and the no worries parking. Driving/parking is crazy nuts so I would recommend leaving the car in the garage and walk! We really enjoyed the staff here. We were in the process of selling our house while travelling (not recommended) so I had to fax & email several documents over and over again as offers were coming in and countering back and the front desk staff were great. I know I must have been annoying but they were professional and friendly at all times. And best of all, everyone spoke English! I was expecting to have language issues, but we never did. I just learned to say \"HELLO\" before they said Bonjour, they would just switch right to English, no worries! Even the Valet guys were super helpful, giving directions and such. When looking at the pictures posted here on TA, our suite looked completely different, the kitchen was WAY bigger and more updated, so maybe you can requested a more updated room? We stayed in room 2006, its a good one! It was directly across the hall from the elevator but we never heard anything. We had excellent sleep, except the sheets and bedding were seriously starched or something, the sheets were crackily so everytime you moved, you made a lot of noise. With a baby in the room, any noise is bad noise! The room was easily baby-proofed and we loved that you could actually close the door on the kitchen and then the baby is safe, even when you are cooking. The old elevator takes FOREVER, if you are checking out during the \"peak\" hours, you could wait over 20 mins for an elevator. I was pissed as we stood there with a twitchy toddler and the elevator opened up filled with maids. Really? The maids are holding up the elevators while your guests are trying to check out? Time to update the elevators and/or get a service elevator!!! So in closing, we loved the old feel of the hotel, it was clean, the staff are nice and its a great location.

The biggest issue? The elevators. They took absolutely forever and were tiny. No matter what language people were speaking, we were able to understand that people were complaining about the elevators each time we were in the lobby. Upon checking into our hotel, we had a couple of bags each and chose to bring them up to our room on our own. We waited for an elevator and one of the bell boys conveniently jumped in before us (with the big cart they use) and this took up more than half the elevator. It was blocking the door for us to enter also and he made no attempt to move it so that we could get into the elevator comfortably. Instead, we had to manoeuver around it (if we had been of larger size, we would have never squeezed by it.) Not the level of service I would expect at a hotel where we should be treated as guests.

Right away, out front sat a bunch of inebriated teenagers (the drinking age there is 18) who were making inappropriate remarks to our 12 year old daughter. That this hotel allows drunk people to loiter on their patio should have been a sign. I went inside to check in and the rude front desk lady said that the valet guy (parking is not free and is under the hotel) was still on duty to park the car. After ten minutes of unloading the car she rudely asked why I haven't given the keys to the valet and how he was waiting for us so that he could leave for the night. That was just the beginning of a series of negative events to unfold. Upon getting to our room (which faced an alley strewn with garbage and which said garbage was picked up at the crack of dawn with very loud trucks) we noticed our fridge was broken and we had two Queen beds. We specifically looked around for hotels with a king bed. The next morning we went down for the \"continental breakfast\" because any food we had was spoiled from the non-working fridge. After taking two bites, the waitress confirmed with us that we knew this was costing us money. What? She said yes there was a sign at the entrance to the restaurant. Well it was in French (as was the guest guide probably noting a cost for this breakfast) and it was turned the wrong way in an attempt in my opinion to somehow scam American's into purchasing things that are normally free. Not only was it not free, it was outrageously priced for what little variety of food there was. We complained with all the above nuisances and the front desk lady said that the breakfast was not included with the price of the room and apologized for the guest guide being only in French but would not comp the meal, that they choose two queen beds for us because they thought \"that is what we would prefer\", and that they would fix our fridge. They took it upon themselves to change our room preference thinking that is what we would've liked. The fridge was never fixed either. As a side note, the heated pool on the roof was in fact not heated and was cold even at the end of July. There is a key to get into the pool area but no one told us that nor was one provided at check in so we had to wait for someone to let us in. There were other minor problems such as a very slow and antiquated elevator system and on the second night there were cops in the lobby for hours going on about something with a guest. Yes the subway is one block away and yes Saint Catherine street is two blocks away but other than that this hotel provides little else.

Thus, I made reservations for everyone at this hotel, against my better judgement. The room looked good, and the two beds were comfortable; however, the hotel goes downhill from here. We were made to take a more expensive room, since we had 3 adults and 2 children in one room. The third adult had to sleep on the hideabed, which was extremely uncomfortable. The mattress was so thin, that you couldn't really call it a mattress. After complaining to the manager, it was replaced with a regular mattress, which was fine for us. During our first night, we were awoken at 1:00AM by a fire alarm. We all evacuated our room, which is what you should do when the fire alarm goes off in a hotel, and the main desk doesn't make a general announcement that it was not necessary. When we got to the main foor, we found out that an SUV had hit a fire sprinkler pipe in the basement garage, and caused the sprinklers to go off. The front desk should have made a general announcement that there was no need to leave your room; however, I feel that this would be asking too much from the staff at le Cantlie Suites Hotel. I was later told that it was the SUV driver's fault that this all happened, since there were signs in the garage that you can't park SUVs at the lower levels. When we checked into the hotel, I was told that ONLY the valets could park cars in the garage. However, as I later found out, since the valets don't work late at night, you have to park your own car/SUV at that time, which is high risk, since, at that time, people are tired and more accident-prone. We needed more coffee packets in our room, and I called the front desk to get some. I was told that they would send some up to our room. No coffee arrived, and a few hours later I called down again and was told that they would send some up. Of course, it didn't happen again. I called down a third time and when I mentioned my problem to the person answering the phone, she didn't even respond. But this time, I finally got the much awaited coffee packets. The next day, wnen I noticed that we didn't get a sufficient number of bath and hand towels from the cleaning staff, I called the front desk, and was told told that they would be sent up immediately. When the person arrived with the towels, he only had bath towels and told me that was all he was told to bring us. I then called the front desk once more and the finally got us the rest of our towels. This was probably the worst hotel stay that I have had in the past decade. I would highly recommend that you stay in one of the many fine hotels in Montreal, where you would be provided with the service and amenities that come with a fine hotel.

The good points about this hotel is the location formost. Right by Mont Royal walkway, metro, and all kinds of shops and restaurants. It is just a couple blocks from the Ritz-Carlton and across from the Sofitel. Bed was super comfortable and the suite with French doors leading to the bed was charming and spacious. Full kitchen was convenient. Now for the negatives: decor and hotel in general is dated and needs to be fully renovated. The bathroom was extremely cramped and can only have one person in it at a time and even then is a tight fit. The hotel uses regular keys on a large card which is not only inconvenient to carry but can pose a security issue. Gym and pool facilities were unimpressive although there were nice views form the rooftop. Now to the biggest issue of all, the Internet! Not only was it not free, but it didn't work probably 75% of the time! Wifi would connect but would time out often and could take over 5 minutes to load a single page. It would work sporadically but over the course of 4 days the issue persisted. It would take 30 minutes to do what could normally be done in 15. If you are a businessperson do not stay here! Even just for leisure it was a huge inconvenience beacuse we were trying to look up maps, directions, and restaurant reviews. At checkout this was mentioned to the front desk and they were no help at all, didn't apologize or offer to take all or some of the Internet bill off.

After we complained at the reception desk, we were told that they do not guarantee the accommodation type, but only the price. Even though we paid for a one bedroom suite, they placed us into a studio \"suite\" that had nothing to do with a suite. It was a rather uninviting uncomfortable room with seriously outdated furnishings and bedding, some kitchen appliances tacked into a small closet and a tiny uncomfortable bathroom. A coffeemaker was located in a bathroom. And because the bathroom was so small, the coffeemaker was right next to the toilet. Bon appetite! There was practically no place for toiletries on the bathroom, and barely a space to dry oneself off after stepping out of the shower. The cafe on premises offered an early breakfast and then got closed. So if you're trying to get something to eat before you check out at the check out time, you're out of luck. Even though the difference in price between the suite we booked and the studio they put us in were $70/day, we did not get a refund, not did we get an apology for being inconvenienced.

How many other hotel guests do you think touched that falling-out-of-the-cover duvet? Positively unsanitary. I had to put a towel over the ironing board when I ironed my clothes because the ironing board cover had some giant yucky stain on it. The lamps didn't work (none of them.)

When we first walked in the lobby, I was impressed with the tidyness and small but comfortable settings. The front desk could not have been more helpful. The rooms are incredibly large (far larger than a luxury hotel chain's rooms) and our rate included both breakfast and wireless internet (which worked just fine, at an entirely adequate speed). The front desk also functioned as the concierge desk and recommended local eateries for us on our budget. They even called and made reservations, which was particularly helpful for a group. Simon, especially, was incredibly friendly and helpful. The breakfast rotated every other day, but it was always fresh, hot, and tasty. Since it was a buffet, if you leave hungry, it is your own fault. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's incredibly convenient to the Metro and in a very nice walking area of Montreal, with lots of shops both above and under ground. There are also enough restaurants at different price points to please a range of budgets and palates. All in all, even if I was going back on a personal trip (which I very well might, Montreal is quite lovely), I would likely stay here. What you get, especially for the rate just can't be beat, and that saves a lot of money to spend on experiences.

We stayed in a room on the rear facing side of the building\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 our room overlooked the downtown area and the river\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not too pretty by day but when the lights come on at night the view is very nice! The room had a very old looking deck that was inaccessible as the glass doorways to it as well as the windows were locked shut. It looked a bit dangerous and old anyway\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The walls are fairly thin so you can hear a lot of dull noise from the hallways and neighboring rooms. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weird but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a vent in the bathroom that seems to carry a lot of noise from neighboring rooms too! And we could always clearly hear when our neighbors were running their water/shower. No biggie though, nothing loud enough to really upset us during our stay. The room had excellent climate control that could be easily and quickly adjusted when we wanted it warmer or cooler. The bed was decent but the pillows were squished out and blah, and they only give you two, so be ready to ask for more! We called and asked for extras and the room staff came within 15 minutes. The kitchenette was nice to have in the room! The microwave, refrigerator and stove are very handy to have if you choose to bring food or take home your leftovers to eat later! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to use the mismatched dishes on the shelves above the refrigerator though\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The bathroom was adequate but probably needed the most repair out of all the other areas. Lots of molding/rotting in the corners, peeling cabinet fronts, etc. Even the towels had some small holes in them. But if you are willing to overlook these things, it was totally functional and just fine to use. The good news is that they give you lots of light over the mirror, shampoo/conditioner, etc, and a decent blowdryer. The water pressure from the shower was very strong too! Overall\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We had a good experience at Le Cantlie Suites Hotel! If you are willing to overlook the old fashioned d\u00c3\u00a9cor and some spots in need of updating/renovations, it is a perfectly good hotel with a great location and helpful staff for a reasonable price!", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cTerrific location.\u201d", "Author": "kelly8059", "ReviewID": "UR40206816", "Content": "Some of the points that other people are complaining about I found charming!

I can say one good thing about this hotel, maybe 2: the bed was really comfortable and the view is really nice. My wife didnt want to take her shoes off, the rug looked really dirty.

But front desk told us we couldnt leave since we book for 2 days and they were going to charge us the full amount for the stay.

There are not enough elevators (3) for a 28 story tower, you will wait up to 5 mins for an elevator at night when people are going to dinner and on sunday during check out. The elevators and the guestroom hallways look like they haven't been refreshed in years and the hallways are this really ugly dark green and wood motif, like a british hunting lodge, but really tacky. The rooms also don't have much (or any) style and the bathrooms are tiny with old style facuets and fixtures. The door locks are actual keys (so not easy to slip into your wallet). I think there may have been a kitchenette in the room behind a closet door, but I didn't notice. The hotel has some unnamed mezanin restaurant above the lobby that serves an expensive breakfast and drinks at night. Had a few beers and appetizers there. Nothing particularly special.

However, the beyond terrible staff does not make the stay at all enjoyable. The walls of the place are so thin that playing music caused us to get two noise complaints (and we were NOT playing our music loud at all). My major complaint was not so much that but what happened at the end of our trip. I had bought an iPod dock in order to be able to listen to music in the room. I set it up on the desk in the room and left the box with all the accessories (ie. the remote, the battery, the manual, etc.) on the ground. The next day after the maid service cleaned our room, I noticed that the box with the accessories were missing. My boyfriend called downstairs where they did not care at all that something was missing and they simply told us to leave a message with housekeeping which we did. Not only did housekeeping never call back but the next day we went down to check out and I told another gentleman what happened and again got the \"I-could-care-less\" attitude. He told me he would check with the housekeeping supervisor so we took a seat and waited half an hour to hear back from him but unknown to us he had left and taken his lunch break. We finally decided to complain to somebody else who happened to be the supervisor, Sam. He was by far the most rude and ignorant person I've ever met. He told me it was impossible and went on to imply that we were liars. Furthermore, our issue was not solved and I am not out $80 for my product which cannot be used without the accessories. Sam also proceeded to threaten us by saying that he would charge us for an extra day if we did not pay for parking which I was refusing to do until somebody took me seriously and solved my problem. Finally, a girl came over and tried to help us but was told that \"we were taken care of\" already by Sam. I have never felt so angry and violated in all my life.

I could not find another hotel with a reasonable rate so decided to try this one. Friends in Montreal provided a bit of history on this hotel. It was originally an apartment building that was converted years ago into this hotel. Originally each floor had 4 apartments... but now each floor offers 12 rooms of different sizes. I booked the king executive suite directly online with the hotel website. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor. I arrived late evening on June 4th for 4 nights. Having a rental car from the airport I called ahead to check on parking availablity which was conveniently easy to access directly under the hotel with elevator access to the lobby. (Valet parking $22 $CAD per day with in out prevleges - no self park available) Check in was quick and I was assigned my room on the 19th floor. The room was OK... the furniture is a bit outdated. The air conditioning was not functioning properly and unfortunately every window, including the balcony door were screwed shut so no fresh air. I will say that the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in and the linens were excellent. The bathroom is tiny but the shower had one of the best water pressures I've experienced. Montreal must not have any water shortage problems. There is wireless Internet available throughtout the hotel ($5 $CAD per day) but no wired access. The wireless connection is poor at best... but for $5.00 acceptable. Next morning prior to leaving for the day I called the front desk to ask about the air conditioning problem and ask about opening the windows for fresh air. I was informed that all windows and balcony doors were sealed shut for security reasons. I questioned that policy indicating that I was an adult only in the room and had no concerns about falling through the window. I was told that they would send someone up to fix the air conditioning. I arrived back late that evening an the room was still hot with no air. I called the front desk and they sent a maintenance man up (who is on call 24/7) to look at the air unit. A very friendly gentleman arrived who reset the air unit and waited until it started working (about 10 minutes). I asked about the locked windows and expressed my disappointment about not being able to get any fresh air. After a couple minutes of chatting he said he might be able to help me and unlock one of the windows... which he did. The difference was amazing. I was seriously considering finding another hotel for the last 2 nights until the window was opened. The management of this property should seriously consider finding some way to put security locks on the windows and doors that their guests can choose to open themselves. I understand the concern for small children but I think adults can make adult choices. The kitchenette had very outdated stuff. A couple forks, a knife, a sad looking small pot and equally pan. An old toaster and microwave. Hard to tell if any of it was actually clean - I would not use any of it.. rather pointless to even be there. I've seen past reviews that they don't clean the rooms properly, or replace towels... I will say that they cleaned the room every day with new sheets on the bed and fresh towels in the bathroom. In future I will stay at this property again - but will need to bring a pair of plyers to remove the screw locking the windows. This property is in an excellent location with easy walking to everything from fantastic restaurants to great shopping. The Montreal Museum of Fine Art is across the street. The staff were all polite and friendly and the room was nice and quiet. There is a swimming pool on the roof with great views.

You can find cracks and chips everywhere. There is no ventillation in the bathroom. The kitchen appliances are so old that we did not even wish to touch it. The matress is old and sunken in the middle. The carpet is old, unclean and feels filthy. We just could not feel comfortable knowing the hotel hasn't been updated for over 15 years. The suite has almost everything, but it's so old that you don't want to touch anything. The hotel does have parking and wireless internet (very weak signal) for additional charges. A separate elevator to the garage would only fit 4 people max without luggage. There are so many hotels in the same neighborhood for the price range.

They said that rooms would not be ready until 4 and that even though I was traveling with 2 other people, they only had a room with one King bed reserved for me. I did enter that there was more than one of us when I booked online. Apparently, three individuals in one bed is normal to Le Cantlie. When I asked if I could pay more to upgrade to a bigger room, I was told that despite the fact that there were \"many\" available rooms, they could not change anything (smoking vs. non-smoking, number of beds, floor I was on, etc.). They did \"kindly\" tell me that there was a sleeper sofa in the room we would be staying in. Seeing as our room was non-refundable we had little choice but to hoof it up to the 26th floor; the 26th floor of only 28 floors. There is an elevator, but it would likely fit only 6 people--it's the smallest elevator I have ever seen. If you are travelling with babies, do NOT stay here. Strollers will not fit well on the elevators. Same with wheelchairs. Upon arrival, I was disappointed with the dated decor...including worn maroon carpets and an 80's style motif. The \"kitchen\" was in a smaller than small closet. Efficient, but dated and looked like it belonged in an outdated RV. The \"Yardley\" soaps promised were M.I.A., and the \"sofa bed\" was encrusted in crumbs and lacking sheets. Of course, you would have thought they would have sent sheets up, given that they knew there were THREE of us and one bed and the sofa bed was THEIR proposed solution. Now for the worst of the worst. We were unable to get our thermostat to work properly. Being on the 26th floor in July, it was warm already, and it kept getting warmer. We went to dinner and came back full of great Montreal food. We were exhausted, and headed to bed. At 3A.M. I awoke...sweating and almost short of breath from the heat. I went to open a window...but--of course, they had GLUED all of the windows shut. This would be a good time to mention that the \"balcony\" door is also glued shut. So, while they are not fibbing when they that there IS a balcony, you cannot use it.

We rented two rooms, one was adequate, the other was atrocious. Room size was great. HOwever, when I got to our room, we went to put some food in one of the refrigerators, only to find a old, half eaten yougurt container, and another \"package\" which looked like the leftovers of a meal out. The other fridge was no good either, as the moment we opened it, the room smelled like every bad fish from the Lachine Rapids.

I was traveling with a teen and a toddler. The location was fine for dining and shopping. We have been to Montreal several times, this visit we stayed our first night at Embassy Suites, but tried to save money on our second night by booking this hotel through Hotwire. Not worth the savings. It is absolutely laughable that this hotel would get the same star rating as the Embassy Suites, which was spotless, included a wonderful breakfast and was absolutely professional. The staff at Le Cantlie were friendly, the room was clean with good beds. BUT --- the entrance to the hotel was absolutely filthy. The carpet at the entrance looked like it had never been swept or cleaned, the dirt and foot traffic had eaten away at the fibers, there were water/salt stains along the sides of the entrance carpet. I realise it is Spring time and we are fresh off of a tough Winter, but cleaning up the entrance should be a constant priority if they are at all concerned about their image... which clearly they are not. The exterior signage gives a run-down picture of the hotel, as well. The elevators were also dirty, with spit stains running down the interior of at least one of the elevator doors, right next to a bunch of nasty messages carved into the door by some well raised guest of the hotel. The kitchen area is laughable, with extremely dated appliances (1950s?), and a nice note letting you know that it is your job -as the guest - to clean the kitchen perfectly or else you will be charged $50... but no dish soap to help you get that job done. My though was that this should be a job for housekeeping, and if they are not responsible for cleaning the kitchen and utensils, then who cleaned it before I got to it? Did the last guest to use the kitchen go out and purchase dish soap, like I did, to clean the kitchen? I have to count on the previous guest to do a sanitary job of cleaning the fork my son is going to use to eat with???? What if it was the same guest who spit on the elevator door? No microwave. Tiny TV in the room, tiny bathroom with a 2 star feel to it, shampoo, but no conditioner. There must be some renovations going on, or maybe it was work next door, as we could hear the sounds of construction work coming through the walls. There are just far too many great hotels to choose from in Montreal --it truly does not make sense to stay in a place like this. Having to view spit running down the interior of the elevator door each time we went back to our room was truly amazing... Internet service is $4.95 per night, but ours did not work, so we immediately called down and cancelled it... I did not want to waste time trying to fix their problem.... the young man who took my call told me it would be cancelled, but then failed to remove it from my bill. I was able to straighten that out as I was checking out.... I think, though I haven't received my credit card statement yet. The hotel is sub-par, even for the $106 we paid per night through Hotwire.... I think a 3.5 star rating was a bit of over-reaching by Hotwire... it shouldn't be just about the amenities which are offered, the most basic in cleanliness and upkeep should be expected. Hotwire had a room w/ two queens available at the Hilton Bonaventure for $89 per night, I got sucked in by the \"kitchen\" and \"suite\" style room (not a suite in our case, must a small hotel room w/ a kitchenett built off of it) at Le Cantlie.

It's in a great location, near the Museum of Fine Arts, shopping on Ste. Catherine (although, I thought the shopping was better in other neighborhoods. Honestly, most of the stores in the downtown area are no different than what you would find in New York, Chicago, Toronto, etc.), the Metro, good restaurants, Crescent Street nightlife, etc. The rooms are large (judging by my room, which was the smallest available room when I booked the hotel.) and clean. And yes, the staff all were bilingual (I'm fairly certain just about everyone in Montreal is), and friendly. The bartender offered suggestions on what to see and do in the city during happy hour (5-7 pm, Martini's for $9). The rooms include a \"kitchenette,\" which in my case included a refrigerator, a toaster and a microwave. The hotel simply asks you to leave the kitchenette as you found it. Obviously, they intend it to be used for light meals and don't want their staff spending large amounts of time cleaning up after a major culinary undertaking. The air conditioning was efficient, and quiet, which was a nice change of pace since I have a window unit at home. My bathroom was large, and I requested a room with a queen sized bed and a couch and coffee table. The room service menu was reasonably priced, and though I never ordered any real food, had I not been in a one of North America's culinary capitols, it's the only time I've looked at a room service menu and thought I'd actually be willing to pay the prices (since this trip was on my dime, and not for business). The hotel also features a roof top pool, which I imagine is nice most of the summer since Montreal gets pretty hot then. It wasn't terribly hot when I was there, so I didn't use it, but it looked nice. Just don't expect an Olympic sized pool - it's a roof top pool in downtown Montreal afterall! I was on a higher floor, so I didn't hear any noise from the street at all. Overall though, Rue Sherbrooke doesn't seem to be one of the more bustling streets in Montreal, so I can't imagine it was that bad on the lower floors comparatively speaking. However, when you're in downtown Montreal (or Chicago, New York, San Francisco, where ever), I think you can expect some noise (afterall, when do you think they're going to collect the garbage in a major commercial district in a major city? 5 am or 10 am?) Now for the negatives: While the hotel is clean, spacious, and nice, it really could use an updating. The wallpaper screams 1989 - not ugly, just dated. The drapes were ugly though. But, they kept the light out at night and in the morning. Honestly, I don't know how much of a negative it really is unless you're looking for the coolest, hippest hotel to stay in. A lot of nicer, but older hotels have this problem. What looked great 15 years ago, doesn't anymore. Time to renovate! Another clue that the hotel needs an update - they still use actual keys to the rooms, and not magnetic strip cards for the locks. Now, I kind of hate those cards in some ways - get em too close to your credit card in your wallet and they don't work - but after a couple glasses of wine, an unfamiliar set of keys is hard to use! Another slight annoyance is that the bed was right next to the kitchenette - so close, that I had to push the bed a couple of inches to open up the doors to the kitchenette every day (I think the maid kept pushing it back). It also bothered me that the hotel puts a card in your bathroom explaining that unnecessary washing of towels wastes water, and requests that if you want your towels replaced to throw them in the bathtub and they be replaced. Otherwise, hang them back up and the maid will leave them. Well, I hung mine back up every day, and yet I still had a fresh set every single day. Also, the stopper in my sink was broken, and when I notified the front desk and asked them to sent a maintenance person to look at it, no one came the first day, and afterwards I think the maid just pulled it out of the sink. To be fair, I didn't complain again, because it wasn't that big a deal. The hotel offers complimentary coffee in your kitchenette everyday. Don't bother. I made it twice (the second time with half the water), and it was brown, hot water both times. The only room service I ordered was a carafe of coffee. Also, there's 28 floors and 3 elevators. Sometimes you have to wait a bit. Also, one ice machine for the whole hotel. On the 27th floor. One note of praise for management. When I checked in I was a bit concerned as I was watching two groups of young people in front of me go in to the hotel with cases of beer. I was getting a little nervous, as I know how loud I was when I was college aged and drinking with a group of friends. Someone who I think was a manager pulled them aside to talk to them about the amount of noise that was coming from their rooms, and explained to them in a very respectful way that their behavior was bothering other guests, hurting the hotel's reputation, and could potentially cost the hotel money in lost revenue. He went on to explain that if he had even one more complaint, they would be forced to leave the hotel. The kids seemed to get it, and I sighed in relief! For a second I was nervous that I was checking in to the Jersey Shore Senior Week in Montreal!", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cDo Not Stay Here!\u201d", "Author": "dmpcpa1", "ReviewID": "UR8361021", "Content": "1. We had a SUITE for 4 people and were charged extra per night for this. This is fine, but you have nerve not leaving one towel per person. They left us 2 towels. I spoke to the maid to tell her there were 4 of us, she said we could only have 3 towels and she gave me one extra for that day only. Then she left us 2 each day. We had to scavenger the maid's supply closet every day for clean towels while she was attending to another room. Do you think this is relaxing for a guest???? Every day, she got 4 dirty towels, but it clearly didn't occur to her how they got there or that she should leave one for each guest. This is STANDARD to leave a clean towel for each guest. This is not unreasonable. Why are we charged an extra charge if you are going to treat us like this?. 2. One of us is pregnant. She told the hotel this and asked for 2 extra pillows because she needed them to sleep, and the hotel said no! Two of us forfeited our pillows to her so she could sleep, which means two of us didn't get any sleep during our stay. In a 3 star hotel, if a guest asks for extra pillows, the hotel should provide them. This is not an unreasonable request. 3. We almost ran out of toilet paper, and the maid did not leave a roll when she cleaned the room. 4. The fridge did not keep anything cold. 5. The room AC did not work and the windows don't open so you suffer. 6. There was duct tape on the remote control. 7. There are 28 floors and only ONE ice machine in the entire hotel. 8. Our 4th person was sleeping on the sofabed and we had to call the front desk 3x to get sheets and a pillow. After the towel/pillow experience, we hid the sheets and pillow each day in the closet so we wouldn't have to beg for it each day. 9.

Upon checkout, I asked to speak to a manager to discuss these matters and the desk clerk paused, said \"um\" a lot, and then said the manager just happened to have stepped out. How convenient.

Yes, the hotel is in a good location but so are most of the others--ie. close to subway, shopping and restaurants. Le Cantlie does not have any better location than any of the other downtown hotels.

An older gentleman working the desk Friday nite when we checked in was rude and pompous. We did not use the swimming pool as it was on the roof and too cool.

I had made my reservation directly with the hotel, by calling, thinking this was better than booking online. This turned out to be a bad idea because while I am sure I informed them at the time of making the reserv that it was for four people--I was billed an additional $50.00 on top of the original quote I was given because my daughters (13 and 15) were with us too. This seemed to me like they were taking advantage of us--it was late Friday nite and obviously we could not go anywhere else and even if we did, we would be billed for this stay as it was after 6 pm. We had no choice, had they told us it would be an additional $100. we would have had to pay. I don't think this was right. Worse yet, after that exorbitant charge, no additional towels or toiletries were placed in our room on either night--only enough for 2! You'd think if they were astute enough to charge us for the additional that they would have been astute enough to inform Hskgp of that fact.

While this location is certainly great and you def. do not need a car to get around, please note, the Hotel is not walking distance to Vieux (old) Montreal and the botanical gardins etc. Many hotel sites list ALL these attractions as though they all within arm's reach. From the Peel street metro, we needed to switch to another metro line after a few stops to get to old Montreal (cobblestone roads, water district, Notre Dame etc). Granted it was only a 15 minute ride there and the Botanical Gardens / Olympic Stadium are only 10 minute ride up on the same line, it's not exactly all in one place. Overall, I was happy with our location, but there's a ton of hotels in McGill Univ. area as well as in old Montreal which are equally accessible to all the attractions if you are near a metro stop, so I would suggest to make your pick based upon weighing out all considerations. The Hotel, itself, was somewhat dated and had a semi-pleasant staff. There was an elderly man who checked us, he printed out some form for us to sign in french and when I asked him what I was signing exactly, he gave a big huff and printed out another one in english. There was a female at the reception wearing shapely glasses who also refused to help me make a reservation for departing on the aerobus (airport shuttle) stating that it had to be done 24 hours in advance, which was BS cause this was never relayed to us initially by the airport shuttle folks who took us to the hotel and another female receptionist succesfully made the reservation for us within minutes after. The manager, Claire, was very nice though when I explained to her that we had an extenuating circumstance which required us to checkout a day early. There was also a younger boy with blonde hair who was very helpful in telling us about all the nearby attractions and directions. Housekeeping staff was nice to bring us extra toothpaste that we had taken away by TSA (even though it was \"travel size\" - TSA manages to always put a damper on my trips nowadays). Overall, the staff was pleasant, but nothing extra special. The beds, bathroom, sheets were comfy/clean and there was a beautiful rooftoop view/pool. The room had no couch as stated in our travelocity booking, it had an cob webbed, dirty balcony and a sink and fridge in a closet (kitchen). The TV was barely 19 inches. If you do not plan to spend much time inside, then it's not bad. We had no problem being outside most of the two days we were there, so it worked out well. If you stay 3+ days, you may want a nicer hotel to stay inside as most of the nearby attractions can easily be covered in 3 days. We even had time to see a movie at the nearby cinema - cheap tickets, $9 for 2ppl in the evening. Other tips: I would recommend getting to downtown by shuttle from the airport ($24 roundtrip). Don't try to find a train and switch to the metro, it may save you $10 bucks, but it's a pain b/c the train is quite a walk from the airport. I would recommend avoiding the grey line tours unless you're looking to kill time. the guides are not very good at discussing important facts or such, they just say what's on their mind and most of the stuff you can cover by foot or metro. I would recommend the botanical garden/ insectarium. The animals in the dome across were ok, too. The Notre dame and Old Montreal are def. great to check out. You can easily cover old montreal in half day and half day in the botanical gardens area. Or you can stretch it out to a full day, each.

One of my relatives had picked this hotel as the place we would all stay. I live near Montreal and have stayed at many hotels there but I had not heard of Le Cantlie Suites. I was therefore somewhat concerned when I was told where we would be staying. These concerns were not lessened by reading the decidedly mixed reviews on this site. What a pleasant surprise. First, there was no problem with the parking. From some of the reviews, I thought there might be a shortage of spots and that we would have to go to a private lot. You simply turn at the corner of Peel and Sherbrooke and turn right into an alley behind the hotel which leads to the underground garage. A pleasant attendant was right there. Upon exiting the car we proceeded a few feet to the elevator which brought us directly to the lobby. It was all so quick. Once in the lobby we were checked in by a friendly desk clerk. I thought the lobby was nice but I also know that many hotels renovate their lobbies so that they are pleasant and new looking but when you get to the room, it is another story. Well, when we walked in the room we were very surprised at how large and nice the room was. The mattresses were very comfortable and the bedding immaculately clean. As it turns out, we had just stayed at the more upscale Marriott Le Chateau Champlain the previous weekend and the room at the Cantlie Suites was almost twice the size. There were two high backed sitting chairs as well. We had drinks at the second floor bar which looks directly onto Sherbrooke Street. It was absolutely lovely and the bartender could not have been any nicer. I realize that one stay can give the wrong impression--either good or bad, but based on this weekend I could defintely recommend this hotel. I don't know about the soundproofing in the rooms that others have complained about. We had an end room and therefore, there was only one room next to ours and maybe that room was vacant or had a quiet occupant but we never heard any noises. Yes, the elevators are small but there were four of them and we never had a long wait. Yes, the bathroom was small but that was a very minor concern. It was clean and the water pressure in the shower was good. The location on Sherbrooks is excellent. On the very next block on Sherbrooke is the Ritz-Carlton.

Some of the front desk people are knowledgeable. The hotel is in a lovely area. The bread shop someone mentioned earlier is delightful. The pool has a nice view. But I did not enjoy this hotel and I regret taking my family there. I felt as if this is a hotel being run on a shoestring and that it was not worth the price. Here's why: 1. I was quoted one price on the telephone and promised a discount that they had \"no record of\" when I got there, and they wouldn't give it to me. Yes, I should have gotten it in writing, and believe me I will next time, but I haven't had a problem with this sort of thing in the past. 2. The rooms were more cramped and the furnishings more dated than they appear in the advertisements. 3. The hallways were dark and the whole place just didn't seem very freshened up. 4. They promised a \"European kitchen.\" Well, then I feel sorry for people in Europe because what this means apparently is a feeble stove that takes forever to heat up, a toaster that goes straight from raw to flame, a refrigerator that keeps foods barely colder than lukewarm, and the bare minimum of materials with which you could cook (i.e; no microwave, maybe two pots, two spoons, etc.). There was just about nothing in that kitchen--it was a really pathetic and miserly collection of odds and ends. Furthermore, I found the note they add, about how they will add $50 if the kitchen area is not spotless when you leave, intimidating and rude. I was nervous because they hadn't provided a broom or anything like that to sweep up with. I tried cleaning the floor before I left with the one rag they provided, but will it pass their apparently stringent inspection? Who knows. 5. Everything there seems second rate. They have ONE ice machine for the whole building. It didn't work. They had two washing machines. and two driers. One washing machine was broken. I spent eight dollars drying clothes, it took all afternoon, and it still didn't work. One of the three tiny elevators stopped working for at least half a day. Basically, staying at this cruddy hotel cast a pall over our experience of this wonderful city.

We stayed at Le Hotel Cantlie Suites and are very happy we did . Its in a great location close to many nice shops , restaurants and transit system . The room we had was very clean and fairly large , we had a bedroom with 2 double beds and a sitting room with a pull out sofa bed . It also contained a kitchenette (built into a closet) that had a fridge , stove and cook top. We only used the fridge , but it was nice to know if we needed to heat something up we could . The only downside of the room was a somewhat small bathroom , a small TV in the bedroom and no TV in the sitting room .We had our two children aged 10 and 12 with us and they loved the pool on the roof , its not big ( goes from 4 to 8 feet deep) but it cooled them off and it also has a great view of the city being that its on the 28 th floor. The only problem I had was not being able to get a good signal using the hotel wireless Internet (11$ a day extra) and after 3 times calling tech support we finally determined it was being so close to the elevator that the metal was blocking the signal . The hotel gladly removed the charge but we warned if you need wireless Internet get a room away from the elevator shafts . The staff were very help full and the front desk clerks were very happy to give directions and went out of there way to help us in any way possible .

I have never been treated so poorly by hotel staff in my entire life and I have stayed in hotels around the world. When we checked in at 1:15pm our 3 rooms were not ready even though I asked for an early check in. Instead of an apology or an offer to rest in the lobby or upstairs in the lounge, we were told hang out downtown until our rooms were ready. Finally our 3 rooms (2 regular rooms and a large suite) were ready, only minutes later we were told that in actuality only our 2 regular rooms were ready and the large suite wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ready until 4 or 5 pm. We decided to kill some time shopping. When we returned I was given the room key to our large suite. I unlocked the door and walked into someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room! Luckily no one was there but all their personal belongings were all over the place. I ran into a hotel staff member and told him my situation and he told me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to work it out with the front desk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he hopped onto an elevator. When I went back down to the front desk, they snatched the key from me and said I should never have received it and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know those guests were staying another night (isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that their job?) So I was given another large suite 4 floors above the other 2 rooms we have so our guests had to be split up which was not the point of the weekend. When got back in the evening we tried to pull out the couch to sleep and realized it was broken but the front desk was more concerned with charging us the extra person charge than finding us another place to sleep at 5am. Another hotel guest offered his room to us because he felt sorry for the way the hotel staff was treating us. Conveniently, the staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find all of the policy documents I signed. The hotel would only send up one cot so one of the girls had to sleep in the broken pull out couch which was folded like a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Upon check out, I noticed we were charged for 2 extra guests (even though there was one extra guest) and when I tried to explain what had happened the night before with our broken pull out couch. Sam who was checking out another guest, jumped into the conversation and said due to one noise complain that he received, he may have lost business and was not going to adjust my invoice and he basically told me to shut up. I was so shocked and embarrassed that after all the hotel had put me though: rooms, not ready on time, rooms on different floors, given the key to someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room, broken pull out couch, charged for 2 extra people instead of one; I was the one being scolded. Never once during any of the incidents did I complain or even raise my voice. And never once during all my difficulties with them did they ever apologize. I would recommend that you, your family and your friends never stay at Le Hotel Cantlie Suites. This hotel was the worst I have ever stayed in. The staff is incredibly rude and disorganized and they have a policy of you have to wash your own dishes in your hotel room or you are charged $50.

The room was in a poor condition, considering that the maids failed to notice the $1 Canadian coin on the floor. The sheets were ripped and had stains. The shower head was very weak, only mist was coming out. The towels had a huge red lipstick stain on it, but yet it was folded nicely on top of the counter instead of being placed in the laundry machine.

They let us check in about 2 hours before the published check-in time of 4 pm. Staff was very courteous. There are three small elevators in the building and that could be a problem at busy times. The rooms have regular keys as opposed to the card access, so we had to stand in line at checkout to turn in the keys and get the final bill. Parking is underneath the hotel at $C16.95 per night. We had checked around with other hotels and they all charge something extra, so no big deal. The breakfast in the restauant was mediocre and expensive. My recommendation here is to have breakfast at any of the small restaurants on St. Catherine St. for half the cost and better service. We didn't eat at the restaurant for any other meals so I can't comment on them. By the way, restaurants on St. Catherine St. and surrounding areas are an absolute bargain compared to U.S. restaurants. Check the menu prices in the windows before walking in.

A couple of days before arrival, last minute rates started to show up, dropping the exec suite to about $130/night US. I emailed again (Stephane, the reservations manager I believe) to see if they would meet that rate. No problem. So, on arrival, I was given a large 1 bedroom suite for only $130/night US.
