I paid EUR115 for the night for a double room. The hotel itself is a very short walk from Frankfurt's main train station, so it's very central and convenient for all forms of transport. The hotel reception staff were excellent - very friendly and welcoming, spoke great English and check-in and check-out were a breeze. The rooms themselves are genuinely oriental in style - lots of dark, carved wood , bright colours, fabrics and tiles. I loved my room, especially the bathroom with its gorgeous mosaic tiling. The room and linen was very clean and I had a great night's sleep thanks to a very comfy bed, great pillows, and some jet lag. Best part of the hotel though, is the Persian restaurant downstairs. I had a late dinner there and the food was superb!!! The lovely guy at reception is happy to offer his suggestions on the menu, and also order for you if you are somewhat lacking in your command of the German language (like me). If you stay at the hotel, eat at the restaurant. In fact even if you don't stay at the hotel, eat at the restaurant. I was running late and didn't catch the included breakfast, but I did have a quick look at the breakfast room and really wished I had woken up earlier!I suspect that the style of this hotel won't suit everyone, so best to check it out on their website first, but I'll definitely be going back there the next time I'm in Frankfurt.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR848488585", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "GeorgiaGirlLondon"}, {"Content": "Traumhaft       Der gro\u813dz\u7709gige Wohnraum", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR147892063", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Buecherwuermchen"}, {"Content": "Nach den viele guten Bewertungen entt\u76f2uscht...   showReview(22891132, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR428739432", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "feequent-worker"}, {"Content": "M\u76f2rchenhaft, wie in 1001 Nacht!   showReview(20656018, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR587548466", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Catral1977"}, {"Content": "M\u76f2rchenhaft wie aus 1001-ner Nacht   showReview(17173951, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR514880972", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "DIESchwarzePerle"}, {"Content": "orientalisches Wohlf\u7709hlambiente der Extraklasse   showReview(16723397, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR987451947", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Travel82008"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d680272-r22758466-Hotel_Villa_Oriental-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "680272", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
