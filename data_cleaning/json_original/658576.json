The rooms are small (European sized - don`t bring the big suitcase) - there is no closet, just hooks on the wall and a small bathroom for our double room. On our second stay, we still loved the prioximity to the South Entrance of Shinjuku station, to the shopping malls, the Shinjukyu nightlife, and the yakitori stands under the train station. Guest services are more limited than a five-star hotel, and this place is well-suited for the more independent self-guide-book traveller. Breakfast buffet for $15 is a good value, and a great starting point to tackle Toyko. Excellent value, and very clean. Dont plan on lounging in your room, its too small. There is a guest services room with coffee and internet, and comfortable seating. The bars are great too.", "Date": "Sep 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR973718658", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Makena07"}, {"Content": "Great value for the money Was not easy to find accomodation for 4 people in central Tokyo on mid-August and finally we booked the Sunroute Higashi trough the Japanican.com website.We found only single rooms available at a very good price including breakfast.This is a japanese business hotel and all the rooms are very small, so if you have many pieces of luggage I suggest to book a twin room which is bigger.When we realized that our luggages were too big for our room, we asked for a bigger one, and even if there were no twin available, the girl at the front desk was really hepful and gave us another single with computer desk which allowed us to have more space to place our luggages.The hotel is new and room are nice, super-clean and quite. Beds and pillows very comfortable. All flat TV with just Japanese channels.The bathroom is small but fully equipped with personal care supplies and hair drier.There is also a laundry room with washer and drier machine for 200Yen.Three pc with free internet are available in the lobby.The location is very good: the hotel is located in the Shinjuku area, but in a more quiet street. Just 10 min walk from the Yasukuni street with department stores and lot of restaurants.The only negative point is the breakfast: poor choice and not great quality. I would reccomend to have your breakfast at the Tilly's cafe in front of the hotel.I certainly will choose again the Sunroute Higashi Shinjuku for my next stay in Tokyo!", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR737073195", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Vlod71"}, {"Content": "Good Value - Good Location My wife and I followed the TripAdvisor report and must agree that this hotel is good value. I would recommend that you spend the extra few dollars and get the Queen size room because it gives you a lttle extra space to move around what is generally a compact room. Bathroom is on the small size and is a great example of mass produced prefabricated bathrooms - but it keeps clean.Hotel was kept in good condition. Reception friendly. Small TV room with two computers were good as we werent travelling with laptops and couldn't make use of Wi-Fi service.Location is great as it is barely a mintes walk to Shinjuku station. Shinjuku is a great area to explore, especially at night with a world of neon sparking to life. On the West side there are the cute streets with small restaurants/bars and an abundance of noisy Pachinko parlours. In the south you have the Times square shopping plaza. If you walk about 15 minues south, you can walk past Yoyogi station and through to the magnificent gardens and the Meiji-Jingu (Great on a weekend where you will catch a wedding in all its splendour). The Eastern side is great by day and by night for shopping and soaking up the scene. On the North, as you pass the scrappy looking train overpass, with a bit of luck you will find your way in to the quaint old alleyways with the pokey little yakitori restaurants and bars (the Golden Gai - definetly a lost pocket of a by-gone Tokyo era). Easy to commute via train to the airport and all points in Tokyo. Very easy to get lost in the Shijuku station/greater area, but thats half the fun", "Date": "Jul 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR999553667", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JLMelbourne"}, {"Content": "Sunroute Shinjuku; Very clean, well situated, very good staff       View from Tokyo Metropolitain Buiding", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR811729505", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DanBenoitQuebec"}, {"Content": "Excellent value and good location A very comfortable, quiet and modern hotel.
