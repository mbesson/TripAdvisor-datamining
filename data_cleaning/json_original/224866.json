When we arrived and saw the view of the beach we were so amazed. Our ocean view room was pretty, clean and huge. it was PERFECT!! Yes the water pressure in the bathroom isnt the best but you can manage. The food here is kinda pricey but you have to try the drinks and monfongo which was delicious. Keep in mind there is free breakfast. There is also a cheaper good quality food at restaurant called Metropol (walking distance) I LOVE that you can catch a 75 cent bus to old san juan . (A cab would be about $20 each way )Take bus T5 OR 53 its about 30 minute scenic ride. Worth it!! TRUST ME! There is also a walgreens close by where I did purchase some souvenirs.

I was there with my family and we had three rooms, so this gave us an overall feel for the hotel. First, the owner and his wife are very nice. I thought everyone that worked there went out of their way to be accommodating. The view is very pretty from the ocean front rooms and from the dining area. The food in the restaurant is very good! If it wasn't for the view and the food, this hotel would have nothing going for it. From the time we arrived, things just got worse and worse. There are always shady people hanging out on the balcony of the hotel, which makes some people feel very unsafe. When one of my family members checked in they were told that the hotel is not responsible for anything stolen out of the rooms. This makes you feel really good, especially with there are shady people hanging out all over the place. Also, 1 of our rooms didn't have a safe. The safes that we did have in the rooms, are the tiniest safes I have ever seen and barely fit anything in them. The rooms were dirty and barely cleaned, if at all. There was toothpaste stains on the faucets. There were used, unwrapped soap bars in the bath tubs and showers. This makes me doubt that the rooms are really cleaned even more. The water temperature in the shower never stayed consistently hot. My first shower was freezing cold. My husband and I both woke up with some kind of bites on our legs. I have no clue what the were from, except that we got them while we were sleeping in the bed. The continental breakfast has barely anything on it. If you something else, you can get it but it is extra. The breakfast was so slim, that we ate off of the regular menu every morning that we were there. Our room was $200 a night and it's probably not worth more than $100 a night. I actually would never pay to stay there again, just because of the filthiness. The event that topped the whole weekend off happened the morning we checked out. We had all just come out of rooms and were sitting downstairs waiting for a taxi. Two couples walked in with their luggage to check in. The cleaning lady (who barely cleans) had been downstairs, right by us the whole time. Plus, we hadn't been out of rooms long enough for anyone to clean our rooms. There might have been enough time to make the bed and empty the trash. Those 2 couples were taken up to our rooms that we had literally just walked out of. I don't know if the hotel staff explained that they were cleaned yet, but regardless...what hotel takes guests to dirty rooms? Disgusting! The really sad thing out this whole situation and this hotel is that the hotel has huge potential to be a very nice, quant little place. The remodeled rooms are cute. The view is great. The food is excellent for the most part. They have a nice beer selection at the bar.

It was nice to be able to hang out or have a night cap at the restaurant overlooking the water at night. Also, the drink and food on the beach are absurd so we just walked the short distance back to the hotel to eat and drink. At the beach you can rent a chair for $4 and umbrella for $10 a day. The beaches were not as nice as in Mexico but still good with palm trees and warm water. This hotel is one of the cheapest in the area. If you are fine with a small but very clean basic room, then I highly recommend this hotel. Also, you can rent a car a couple of blocks away and the taxi to the airport is around $14 to the airport for 2 people with 2 bags. Puerto Rico is expensive and not many values exists.

If you want a no frills experience with very friendly staff and very easy beach access, this is a good bet. Our double room had two double beds, A/C, ceiling fan, and a large bathroom with a stall shower. Plenty of towels, shampoo, and soap were provided, as were beach towels (those we had to ask for). Beach Access: You actually have access to two different beaches. Picture the coastline as a \"W\" -- Hotel La Playa is located at the tip of the middle apex of the W. Across the street from the front of the hotel is one long stretch of beach, but if you exit the hotel via set of steps and hop off of a rock on the restaurant side, you've got access to the other stretch of beach. Bar/Restaurant: La Playita, open to the public, is the open-air bar/restaurant on the ground floor, overlooking the ocean. It's a beautiful spot, save for the abandoned building next door that's a bit of an eyesore. Drinks (prepared by Blake, the bartender) were great, and the food was pretty good too. A plentiful continental breakfast (juice, coffee, bagels, cold-cuts, sliced cheese, scones, cookies) is included with the room rate. On our last night, a Saturday, the bar area had a musician singing and playing guitar in the evening.

Also, after looking at many different hotels that were on or close to the beaches, we realized that they were extremely expensive (200-350) and they didn't even include continental breakfast! So we reserved the playita hotel for 2 days and then took a cruise from san juan. The hotel is literally located at the end of a street that is on the beach. This hotel is a hidden jewel. There is only one narrow street that directs you to the hotel so mark sure to rent a small compact car if planning to. There is very limited parking so you must speak with the valet driver to reserve a parking spot. At the register we were welcomed by a loving staff. We checked in but the only thing that was somewhat strange was that they charge ur credit immediately there when u first arrive and not at check out. Also, I had many visa mastercard gift cards from my wedding, and they couldn't use them because they were not familiarize and their credit card machine wouldn't process them. So, we paid for our room for 2 nights and it came out to a grand total of $205 with continental breakfast that would include bagels, cream cheese, fruits, cheeses, lunch meats, cereal and juices ( better something than nothing ). Our room was small, with modern wooden and eco-friendly furniture. The only down fall was that the queen size was harder and stiffer than a theraputic bed, but we couldn't complain bc we were only there for a short stay anyways. The ac at night made a lot of noise which made it hard to sleep at night but if u tell the front desk they will fix it. The resturant/bar area was located downstairs in an open area that had views of the ocean and live music at night. The restaurant had affordable and reasonble items on the menu. The kitchen was open until 12am. When u exited the hotel to go outside, you literally stepped onto the beach. At night I would strongly recommend for people to stay at the hotel or the beach near the hotel, and not wonder off. The streets leading to the main street off the hotel are dark. If you plan on wondering off and discover the night life, take ur rented car or more preferably a taxi which only ran$ 5 dollars on the isla verde street, or $10-15 to old san juan area. But honestly there is no need to wonder off but you have everything at this hotel. We would only go sightseeing during the day which was amazing because we were close to everything. It is located 5minutes from the airport, 10 minutes from san juan/old san juan area, 20minutes from the rainforest el yunque, 20minutes from plaza americas. I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone for a short stay just at the fact that the beds are hard and that it is not ur average huge commercial resort.

The previous week, we stayed at the home of local friends in Caguas while traveling around the island. We decided to have one night of a vacation experience before flying home to the states. So, we stayed here, sight unseen, because of the strong recommendation of several Puerto Rican friends. After seeing the bad experience described on Trip Advisor, I was a little wary, but we decided to trust the locals. And boy were our friends right about this place. It's just lovely. Since we came during the off season, we were able to arrive without a reservation and check in to a room immediately. For just under one hundred dollars, we rented this lovely room and received a fresh continental breakfast in the morning. Incredible value for the super touristy Isla Verde. The rooms all open to not a drab carpeted hallway but to a central beautiful courtyard, with pretty landscaping and high quality patio furniture. The rooms were on the smaller side, but beautifully furnished with dark wood furniture: two queen beds with four pillows each, central nightstand, a large closet with a safe, a comfy lounge chair, lovely tiled bath, and a flatscreen television carrying many English channels. And yes, it was so incredibly clean!!! I can't emphasize that enough. Our room was on the second story with a side view of the ocean. We left the windows open (they do have screens) to smell the sea air as we were sleeping. I really appreciated the eco-friendly nature of the hotel, even the soaps were labeled to be organic and without animal testing, I believe. The hotel is literally steps from the huge beach, with jet-ski rental, para-sailing and surfing lessons within walking distance. I especially appreciated that the whole place displays local paintings and sculpture. I even saw that there were hosting an art opening at their space within the next couple of weeks. It's so wonderful to see a hotel supporting its local arts community instead of using the same old generic mass produced prints in its decor. Yes, the service was incredible. Everyone made an effort to speak some English, smile and offer suggestions to you. The hotel even has access to a roof deck with incredible beach and ocean views. I imagine it would be a great place to bring a nice bottle of wine and watch a sunset. I think this wonderful restaurant is really what makes La Playa a truly unique in Isla Verde. I did not see any other hotels on the strip that had a restaurant literally on the water. Even if you don't stay here, come for at least one meal. As others have mentioned, part of the restaurant is a patio built on piers. The waves splash underneath you as you drink you coffee in the morning, you look out on the ocean, and see, yes, manatees! playing in front of you. It is undergoing a menu change into a wine bar with 70+ different bottles and live local music on the weekends. Their bottled beer selection was also impressive. I just enjoyed sitting on this patio feeling the ocean spray, drinking coffee, and watching surfers. perfect. This is not where to go for a traditional, never leave the premises resort experience. What it is, is a perfect place to relax and enjoy the beach for a few days; or a great home base as you explore the island. I could see spending the day snorkeling in Culebra, hiking El Yunque or shopping in Old San Juan, then coming home to this beautiful spot, close to the airport. In short: lovely decor, great service, beach access, free parking, comfortable rooms, and a wonderful daily breakfast. I almost didn't want to write this review because I don't want it to become so busy and expensive I can't go back! Enjoy it while you can.

I chose this hotel because, unlike the other beachfront (and not so beachfront) hotels on Isla Verde, this looked to be the best value for location. The location was excellent. While there was no accessible beach area directly at the hotel, the beach was across a small street- no dodging traffic or anything. The rooms weren't fancy, but who's going to spend time in the room? Our room (a double) was very clean, very quiet, and very comfortable. The bathroom looked like it had been updated and we even had a side view of the ocean. The hotel bar and restaurant was beautiful- it was an open area that was right on the ocean. And I mean right on top of the ocean. If you were on the deck and the sea was a bit rough, you definitely got at least sprinkled whenever the waves crashed. The food and drinks were a little overpriced, but pretty much in line with any of the other beachfront restaurants in the area. The service was a bit slow, but we were never in a rush, so it didn't bother us. Food and drinks were very good, too. It was an easy walk to the main street of Isla Verde, where there are lots of restaurants, bars, and shops. We ate at a restaurant one night, but didn't go to any bars or clubs, so can't really offer any views on that. One note is that the service at La Playa was excellent. It is a small hotel (15 rooms, I think) and has the feel of a family run place. Everyone we interacted with was very helpful and nice. We had to have a package overnighted to the hotel and the front desk was gracious enough to call us at 8:30 in the evening while we were out to dinner to let us know that it had arrived. This is a place we will definitely stay at again without any hesitations!", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cFell in love with this hotel....\u201d", "Author": "JanetC", "ReviewID": "UR88856649", "Content": "I'm not even sure how I stumbled across the hotel in Trip Advisor but I'm glad I did. Was looking for something reasonable and close to the airport and I found so much more. I thought this hotel was adorable...reminded me of an old school hotel in Miami or something. I loved walking in and hearing Jimmy Buffet, etc over the speakers, too. It is right on the water but you need to walk across the street to get to the actual beach. I was upgraged to an ocean view room upon arrival..this room was great and what a view (if you are staying awhile, it would be worth the extra money, I think). There is a restaurant and bar here which overlooks the water...food was good and they had live music (tho, that did go somewhat late). Now, this is definitely not a 4/5 star hotel, more like a 3 star but it's very cute and a good value for the money. In fact I would have given it 5 stars except I had a lot of problems with the shower and getting hot water (which I also had in OSJ-so might be a broad problem). I personally would stay in OSJ over Isla Verde but this is def a good option if it fits what you are looking for.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLittle Nightmare By The Beach...\u201d", "Author": "GRAYandGIGI", "ReviewID": "UR73965136", "Content": "We were so excited about this little spot we found! We had researched & compared deciding we did not want a cookie cutter hotel room and so chose Hotel La Playa. Walking in through the entrance the plants & manicured greenery were inviting & quaint. If this was the entrance we thought the rooms would be great! Only one room was available for our stay, for some reason no one booked it the whole week. The gentleman at the reception was kind enough to show us the room briefly. We came in & out after 10 seconds noting the view of the water & the super tiny balcony area which appeared neglected, with 2 white plastic chairs thrown about by the rain. The \"balcony\"'s view to the left was an abandoned hotel & trash surrounding it. If we booked it the \"balcony\" would be prepared nicely we were told. Although we thought the price was high & tried to get a discount to no avail (the online price was cheaper), being tired we gave in. Arriving a day or two later around 8:00PM we brought our luggage up with help. My mother in law joined us. The lady that evening, Lucy, told us there was a shortage of pillows to use one from our bed. We had 4 on our bed so we pulled one out for mother to use. Unpacking I went to the restroom & noticed a used towel hanging to dry on the ironing board... The toilet had a strange goo on the seat, we hoped it was some sort of cleaning chemical... While washing my hands I noticed the tiles to the left were covered with what looked like accumulated toothpaste rinse water splatter from past guests...We walked out to the \"balcony\" & saw it was exactly as we had seen it except for a small frail plant with 3 leaves (not the lush plants at the entrance or in the balcony next door), a beat up tiny round table and an extra plain wet plastic chair. There was what looked like to be a pole for an umbrella yet no umbrella just wet everything. Ok we thought at least we have a view... We pulled the curtain to the window at the left to reveal an ugly wood panel, was it covering an old A/C hole, a broken window??? It looked to have been ignored by many as layers of dust on & around this window disaster were discovered by our fingers. Lets put some drinks in the fridge, we need something to cool us down, but no small refrigerator. We decided to shop for a cooler & ice. The room key opens it & locks it so when our mother decided to stay we were actually locking her in, which we thought would be horrible if there were a real emergency. Lucy told us there was no extra key, which we found to be alarming. Anyhow, we just left the key with our mother & had to wake her up to open the door when we returned. Going for a brief walk before bed we sat by the water on the wet plastic chairs though we could only hear but not see the unlit black waves hitting the small dock. After sitting in the dark for 10 minutes we went upstairs & my wife noticed a small bite on her forehead & applied ice on it. There was a bright light in the balcony that would shine through the door, since we could not find the switch I unscrewed it... We wanted to hear the waves as we slept but there were no screens so we closed the windows & went to bed. At 2AM my wife wakes me up telling me she could not open her left eye. The left side of her face was unbelievably swollen & huge! Quickly I went to a 24HR drugstore & got some antihistamine. At 3AM we were at the Emergency Room of a local hospital. They ran labs & hooked her up to some IVs. All for 12 hrs.! While she took this treatment I went to the hotel to get our things & ask for a refund for the extra days. As I waited another guest told me how the week before she was ill with Dengue from a mosquito bite while at the hotel!! We did not want to go through any further risks so they were nice enough to refund the nights we were not staying... At the end we fled to a nearby Doubletree that was a true haven for us. Hotel La Playa has the potential to be a great spot. It has no bells & whistles yet lacks some basics as well. That it is by the water is true but I would not go back unless they put themselves in their guests shoes. Then they would be more observant & considerate...& keep their guests.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best experiences I've had in the Caribbean\u201d", "Author": "LJRivera", "ReviewID": "UR70819635", "Content": "The last time I visited La Playa hotel was back when I was a teenager and it still had more of a motel feel.

Two of my friends and I shared the double bed ocean front room which gave us a beautiful view of the water right below and the beaches in the distance. The location of the hotel is prime. You can visit many local clubs and sights without having to pay the sometimes outrageous prices of the El San Juan or the Intercontinental. We never had a problem parking our rental car (for free) and a security guard or valet was almost always around to watch your vehicle. Lastly, La Playita Restaurant and bar which is located on the first floor of the hotel has a laid back and romantic feel that is not met anywhere else in Isla Verde. And the food - DELICIOUS and well priced in an area where other restaurants often take advantage of the tourist crowd.

The rooms are immaculate, and some of them (i.e Room #209) are more of a mini-suite with balconies and ocean views. The doors to the rooms have a special locking feature that prevents dampness in the rooms, even in the most humid conditions. The beds are amazingly comfortable. The staff is small and very friendly; you will know most of them by first name, including the owner, by the end of your stay.
