It is fairly easy to get downtown-- a short taxi ride to the subway and then a long ride on the subway. But why not avoid the hassle and stay downtown? That said, the hotel is very clean and comfortable ( my room was always immaculate). The staff are all very pleasant. Despite its location next to a busy highway, my room was very quiet and the views from the higher floors are panoramic. So-- if you need to stay in this part of the city for work- related reasons rather than tourism, this is a very good choice PS I gave the swimming pool a score of 2 because it is very small, but it was very clean", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mexico", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "j_traveller2007", "ReviewID": "UR106585570", "Content": "This hotel is located close to Sixflags and other atractions in the south of the city like Xochimilco and Coyoacan.

The staff were so helpful to me as a virtually non- Spanish speaker and as a woman who spent some of the trip alone, it felt like staying with family. Yet this is an ideal hotel for business people or in my case, as a conference delegate. It is practically attached to a moll which has many banks and other places to change money. There is a 24 hour store called Subway a few seconds away. The nearest metro was the university and I went there by taxi to get onto the metro network which at 15 pence is the cheapest and fastest way to get around Mexico City. It is not within walking distance but taxis are always outside the hotel. The food was marvellous - a breakfast buffet with a huge variety of food including Mexican specialities. The room was a treat with wonderful views of the city.

I stayed there for three nights in December before the Christmas holiday. While there are many fine hotels closer to the City's business district in Polanco or near Reforma, I was having a great deal of trouble finding good options in the south of the City. The Fiesta Inn proves that such options do exist. The hotel is located smack against the Periferico in a location near UNAM, the Azteca and Perisur. The hotel contractors must have used doubly-enforced windows because although my window faced the Periferico, it was super quiet. I was on the 12th floor with a nice southern view, made less expansive, of course, by the smog (or fog?). The room was new, nicely appointed and spacious, with big windows stretching from floor to ceiling. Most importantly, it was extremely clean. The room had only a traditional TV as opposed to a flat-screen, but I thought that was to be expected given the price. The hotel also has a nice business center. They say that there is wireless access in the room, but I couldn't confirm because I didn't have a laptop with me. The service was excellent. I was given the room in a flash and hotel operators were quick to answer questions. Everyone was friendly and attentive. My package came with a breakfast buffet included, which I enjoyed each morning. They had a great selection and plenty of room to eat in a bright, airy space. (Though for some reason I can't explain, they choose to have a TV on in the restaurant area. I never can understand why hotels make that choice. Background music would be highly preferable.) I also ordered room service one night, and it came within 15 minutes - it was tasty and not too pricey. A few minor flaws. The gym is cramped and lacking in some equipment such as floor mats. Also, the hotel charged extra for a big bottle of water in the room, which I thought was a bit unfair given the issues with tap water in Mexico City. But these are truly minor complaints. In all, it was a great experience top to bottom. I felt like I was getting a great value for a little sanctuary in the bustling City. And the hotel's also adjacent to a mall in case you need to buy anything. If you're looking for a reliable value in the southern end of Mexico City, I can't speak for other alternatives, but I recommend at least checking out the Fiesta Inn Periferico Sur.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "medellin", "Title": "\u201cnice place\u201d", "Author": "erickMedellin", "ReviewID": "UR19697443", "Content": "Nice location, this one is 2 blocks from a big mall, and if you do not care to take a bus ( pesero) it is 10 minutes from a subway station, that is one the most important thing in Mexico DF because the chaotic traffic.

Rates are fair and cheaper on weekends due to target market, however if you want to visit Mexico University, Tlalpan Centre, Xochimilco or Coyoacan these is the place to stay. Cab rides to downtown are extremely expensive so if you wish to visit Centro or piramides never mind booking these place. Rooms are great, extremely clean and with cool amenities just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the view its little depressive.
