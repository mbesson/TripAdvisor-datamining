The fundamental concept, a hotel constructed from a block of original 17th century canalside houses creates a sense of intimacy which sets it apart from modern purpose built alternatives. True, it is a bit of a rabbit warren. But every walk around the hotel brings with it a feeling of discovery. And however many times I stay there (and that must be 6 or 7 by now) I never lose that sense. This concept also makes the most of the hotel's great location in the middle of some of Amsterdam's most attractive canal walks. In the week before we vistied there had been an impromptu concert on the frozen Prinsengracht right in front of the hotel's boat dock. The delightful central courtyard gardens (where lunches can be taken in summer) creates a feeling of openness and well being. We particularly like the small breakfast bar close to reception where you can sit by the garden window have a cup of coffee and piece of fruit rather than facing the buffet in the restaurant. And we love the bar, where if you want a nightcap, they\"ll be as happy to make you a mint tea as to serve you a cognac. In our experience the rooms are peaceful and quiet, though I do know that some people prefer to avoid rooms on the ground floor with canal frontage. The beds and furnishings cannot be faulted. I have to save special praise for the concierge staff. Their helpfulness in dealing with our car and in recommending and reserving restaurants was exemplary this time, as it has been on every occasion we have visited.

The Hotel Pulitzer must be one of the best hotels in the city. Its location, right on one of the central canals, cannot be beaten. You are literally minutes from the tram stop and Anne Frank's House. The staff at the hotel are brilliant. So friendly and professional. The restaurant was very good and the service excellent. The bar manager and his staff were outstanding. I really can't say enough about how good they are which makes The Pulitzer a true gem. The standard rooms are small (even by European standards) and the bathrooms even smaller! Having said that, they are exceptionally comfortable with wonderful big beds and top quality linens, pillows, etc. If room size is important to you then definitely upgrade to the bigger canal view rooms to avoid disappointment The weather during our stay was very cold and we so enjoyed returning to our comfortable, warm and cosy room. Turn down service (which you have to request) was great. Each night we came back to bottles of water at the bedside, fresh towels and the Bose Radio playing softly in the background. A little cardboard canal house was left on the pillow containing a delicious chocolate. What a great welcome back. As I mentioned, the restaurant was very good - excellent steaks - and the wine choice equally impressive. Ask the waiter if you can try a sip of the wine before you order a bottle. They offer almost all the wines by the glass and are happy to oblige. We didn't have breakfast in the restaurant but opted instead for room service. It was the only disappointing element of our stay - over priced and poorly presented. I'm sure breakfast in the restaurant would have been better but it was also very expensive so we had breakfast out for our remaining days. Apart from breakfast we couldn't have aksed for more. A wonderful stay at a simply wonderful hotel.

The Sheraton Amsterdam by the Airport, or the Hotel Pulitzer. I've been to the Sheraton before and it has been a good experience there, and this time I wanted to try something a bit different and more centrally located to the city itself. First off, when you get to Amsterdam Central definitely ask someone where the hotel is. It's in a bit of a discrete location between canals so it can be hard to find. Fortunately, Amsterdam has some of the most friendly people on the planet so they're always happy to help you. Once you get to the hotel, you can't help but notice the unique appearance. Is this really one large hotel connected by canal houses? You better believe it! The lobby itself is nice and quiet, I was greeted by a very friendly receptionist that acknowledged my status with the SPG program and then informed me that I had been upgraded to one of their Luxury Suites! It had been a stressful day of travel so to hear this was very positive. I was taken up to my room which was on the 5th floor, but was really the 3rd floor. And it was the only room on that floor. Confused yet? This is one of the very unique things about this hotel. It's very easy to get lost, but you just have to pay attention to the signs. There are over 200 rooms and it's all connected by 20+ canal houses. I've never seen anything like this before, and that's a great thing. The luxury suite itself was very large. It was two large rooms, very classic furniture and a very comfortable bed. It was indeed top notch quality, and the bathroom felt as if you were in a Ritz Carlton...but that shouldn't be surprising as this is a Luxury Collection hotel that is of the highest quality in the SPG chain. The staff here is very friendly and I was always greeted with a smile and asked if there was anything they could do to make my stay more enjoyable. I got directions to the RLD which is about a 10-15 minute walk if not less than that. It's very convenient, and better than taking the train from Schipol down to Amsterdam Centraal and then walking to the RDL which is the case with the Sheraton Amsterdam. The good things about this hotel are that it is a first class luxury property, it's incredibly unique, the rooms are in immaculate condition and the staff does its best to make sure that the guest is taken care of. One might find the hallways and the twisting around one side to the another a bit annoying, but this is just one of the unique aspects of this place. I got lost a couple times, but enjoyed every bit of it. You will not see many hotels like this around the world, so it's definitely appreciated. If you're an SPG member, you have a couple choices and this is a fantastic one. The Sheraton Schipol is still a nice hotel and the train station is right there. But the Hotel Pulitzer is much more closer to the action and for around the same cost I feel this is just a better choice. It's just one of those unique experiences that one will never forget.

As a tourist hotel, it is highly competitive as the location is superb and the property is very charming (25 row houses adjoined in an ingenious yet slightly whimsical way). However, as a business hotel it is more of an acquired taste. Most rooms are very small and the furnishings are getting dated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, most rooms have a very small armoire instead of a closet. The desks are reasonable but the internet connectivity is very spotty. The bathrooms (remember - these were 17th and 18th century row houses) are very small and need to be updated.

We booked a double bedroom with Pulitzer Hotel through venere.com for weekedn at the start of November. At the time we booked it was a special deal at \u00c2\u00a3460 or thereabouts. When we checked in at the hotel, the lady at reception took her time to act as concierge arranging dinner for current guests (even though there was a separate concierge desk and a queue waiting to check in) and kept us waiting. When we finally checked in, we were told that our room had 2 single beds and that the hotel had no concept of a double room - which is an absurd concept in itself given that no matter how rooms are described, they are either single, double, twin or triple. The hotel insisted we took the matter up with venere separately even though we had a clear written confirmation from venere that we had booked a double bedroom. The hotel claimed that venere had confirmed a twin room with the hotel given its lack of double bedrooms. Hard to believe that venere would take the time to provide separate and different confirmations. In order to provide us with a double bedroom, the hotel offered either a smaller queen room or an executive room (which is larger than the room to which we were entitled), the latter at a higher cost. We were not entitled to a reduced cost if we chose the queen room. This behaviour makes no commercial sense at all. When we refused to accept this proposal, eventually the hotel, somehow managed to find a room that was just cleaned up (NB this was at 8pm) and that room would be available to us. The experience marred our first day in Amsterdam and did not give us a good impression of this hotel.

The Pulitzer is NOT for the boring mundane or generic individual. Why? Because it is a charming luxe hotel facing the canals in the prime Amsterdam locale , unique, artful, possessing plush down beds, clean , tastefully decorated rooms in updated multi canal houses multi leveled and unique in every way. The restaurants are gorgeous , food delish, , ambience sophisticated and upscale. If I were to be picky I might critique the bathroom. Smallish, But The bed and comfort level, the view from our second floor room right out unto the canals made up for that, and the small bathroom became irrelevant.

I always choose this property due to its central location. All of the major sites of downtown Amsterdam are within walking distance. It is a ten minute walk to the Damrak, 15 minutes to the Rembrantsplein or the Leidseplein. The area in which the hotel is located, the Jordaan, is comprised of several romantic little streets filled with unique and charming shops and restaurants. It is, itself, one of the popular attractions (the 9 straatjes) of Amsterdam. The rooms all vary in their size and layout because this property is really an amalgamation of many small homes. I arrived at this property very early due to the arrival time of my transatlantic flight. I asked, at 07:30 in the morning, if anything was available. As always at this property, the young lady was kind but truthful - all of the rooms were occupied but since several people had already checked out she could expedite the cleaning of one of the rooms if I could wait 45-60 minutes. One hour later, true to her word she woke me up in the arm chair in which I was sleeping and gave me my room key, apologizing that an upgraded room (due to my Starwood Platinum status) was not available at that time. The next day I was upgraded to a lovely suite with separate living and sleeping rooms. At the first mention of difficulty with the wifi system I was visited by a member of the management staff who worked on the problem until it was solved. I am very impressed by the professional service provided by the staff of this property. It is a nice balance of service without subservience. I am always made to feel genuinely welcome and would never consider staying anywhere else.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cweekend break, lovely base\u201d", "Author": "KentMadmum", "ReviewID": "UR120195874", "Content": "Long weekend family break.

The breakfast was very nice but we did not use the hotel for other meals so we cannot comment. It has a nice bar, and garden and all in all was a very pleasant stay, although the exchange rate is so rubbish at the moment luxury hotels seem that bit more expensive.

A minor niggle is the breakfast coffee is machine made unless you ask for a fresh one. Even that is not to normal Dutch standards. However, that is a very minor niggle.

The bed was queen, the TV was a flat screen and there was a mini fridge. The hotel has a restaurant and a bar. I enjoyed their AMAZING breakfast buffet every morning. Usually I don't refer to a buffet as amazing, but in this case it really was. It was filled with smoked salmon, various meats and cheeses, eggs, breads, cereal, fresh fruit and fresh squeezed juices etc. The staff at the hotel was friendly, but not as helpful as I had hoped. It may have been a miscommunication on my part as I may not have asked the right question, or it could have been them pushing the things they are told to push. Who knows. The location of the hotel is stellar. The hotel spans two canals so either way you can't go wrong. It is very centrally located and not more of a stone's throw away from the Anne Frank house.

It felt grubby and was cold, the main bedroom was tiny,the bathroom (tiny) had mould around the window and where the grout had come away from the tiles, some of which were cracked, and stains were showing through the painted exposed beams in the sitting room. The space for clothes was totally inadequate and the TV entertainment system was either extremely slow to respond or did not work. I immediately advised reception that I was unhappy with the room only to be told that the size was typical of hotels in Amsterdam! After advising that I have visited the city many times and stayed in many other hotels, this particular excuse was dropped and several apologies offered. It came as no surprise that no other rooms were aviailable that evening but I was assured we would be moved the following morning. The apologies were welcome but did nothing to compensate for the disappointment and simple feeling that I was being \"ripped off\". I deeply resented the fact that I was being charged an amount approaching 700 Euros (including breakfast for 3) per day for a room that any B&B would be embarrassed to let out (no offence to all the great B&B`s in Amsterdam). The next day we were moved to a suite and by way of compensation were offered a 20% discount on the previously agreed rate for the junior suite as well as numerous apologies. A bottle of wine, bowl of fruit, selection of soft drinks and letter of apology quickly followed. I would add that we did not consume any of their offerings. I believe the staff response was all that could be expected, but the fact is that this hotel is very tired. It is not a 5 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination and senior management should be ashamed to proclaim and advertise it as a luxury collection hotel. We were keen to stay there due to the great location and the fact that it is not purpose built but was converted from a number of traditional canal side houses, so were anticipating a degree of charm that a purpose built hotel would find difficult to match. We did not eat in the hotel other than breakfast. This was a very average buffet style offering in reasonable surroundings. Next time (no, there won`t be one) I will eat out. The general level of service was just average, so perhaps disappointing on the basis of the 5 star luxury claim for the hotel. It would be nice to see hotels take their guests more seriously and not give the impression, as this one certainly does, that they are there purely for the purpose of having as much money extracted from them as possible. Something approaching value for money would be great; or even the feeling that we are getting value. They even charge 10 Euros for WiFi on top of the room rate and cost of breakfast.

First off, the location is perfect. Just outside the craziness, but close enough to walk. It is set on a canal in a lovely neighborhood -- close to many museums. We walked everywhere. No taxis. No bikes...The buildings are very cool. The hotel consists of many connected buildings and getting to your room can sometimes be an adventure -- especially after a glass of wine or two. We stayed on points but got a Platinum upgrade to a suite on the canal -- without even asking. Now that's Platinum recognition. Also, the full breakfast is included for Platinums -- an amazing benefit. Both the food and service are great. This isn't one of those cheap 'lounge' breakfasts. This is the real deal. Finally, the staff was wonderful. Especially Frank, the Asst Front Office Manager who offered to help us in any way he could.

We ate five amazing meals there during our stay. If the restaurant was here in NYC we would eat there all the time. My husband has a severe allergy to tree nuts and the staff could not have been better. The pork chops were cooked to perfection--and they made my husband a lovely apple reduction (since the pepper sauce on the menu had traces of nuts). The next night he had the filet mignon, and again they made him a special sauce this time with truffles. At most restaurants the staff usually would not go through the trouble of making a new sauce and would have just served it plain. The hotel ordered in special bread for my husband as well, since I had informed them in advance of his allergy. The buffet breakfast included with the room was very decadent with many offerings. I have been to five star restaurants that had a larger selection, but this one has the best quality of food which to me is more important. The breakfast included a cheese offering of the finest Holland cheeses. Since it is not safe for my husband to eat at buffets, the staff prepared him his eggs in a separate area. They also included a nice mix of fresh fruit, nut free bread, and cucumbers for him. Everything was so very delicious. Also, stop by the hotels cafe for the best apple pie. My husband could not eat it, but I savored every bite. A little bit about the hotel. We would definitely stay there again. The location is perfect -- right in the center of everything. We were able to walk everywhere. The room was very nice. If you are older be sure to ask for a bathroom that does not have a high ridge to step over--this was the only thing I did not like about the hotel. We took the boat tour on the hotel boat it, which Winston Churchill by the way went on. It is well worth it. They had drinks and little snacks on the boat. We loved the architecture of the hotel--it is wonderful for those who like to stay in well-renovated historic hotels. Be sure to ask the concierge about arranging a walking tour.

This being said, the rooms are overpriced, most of the staff is rude, and the building is very moldy. My biggest complaint of this hotel comes from the concierge. This trip was part of a bachelor party with 5 of my closest friends. We had asked the concierge for a recommendation as to the night life. He said he could get us into a night club called Jimmy Woo for a 2 bottle minimum which he said would cost $450 Euro's as well as a $100 Euro deposit. Granted we were six guys and it would normally be very hard for us all to get into a club together, we decided to go for it.

Yes, there might be some \"extra corners\" in the hallways compared to a genuine hotel and you sometimes don't find the way immediately, and sometimes you have to face the \"acoustics\" of a 17th century building, but this is just a consequence of the 25 canal house concept. But otherwise you would not have the chance of sleeping in a \"real canal house\" with wooden log ceilings, a view and tons of atmosphere. The bar and the restaurant are great, the canal boat \"The Tourist\" is just great with its looks and its history (Churchill was on it). So, go there and enjoy! The hotel is very classy, the concierge Ron is a lot of fun and if you have the chance to get one of the junior suites it will be the best hotel experience which exists...

The Pulitzer is in an affluent area that seems to be residential, but also had MANY choices as far as bars and restaurants. We booked this hotel with Starwood points for four nights, checking out on July 31st. We had read the reviews here online, and were a little worried about what the room might be like (reviews spoke of very inconsistent rooms due to the nature of the building--it is several converted canal houses), and the helpfulness of the staff as we also read that some were not as helpful as they could be, and others that said they were downright rude. I am happy to say that we did not encounter that at all. Upon check-in, Marleen VanRheen greeted us with a warm and friendly smile. We arrived earlier than anticipated and so were worried that room might not be available, but she assured us one was. I told her we were gold preferred members, and asked if we could be upgraded to a canal room. She informed me that we had already been upgraded to a deluxe room facing the garden, and that should we want it, we could upgrade to a canal view room for E$50 extra per night. I asked if we could see both rooms ahead of time before we made our decision, and she didn't skip a beat. She immediately made some calls and told us that would not be a problem. I was very impressed with her easygoing, professional and efficient manner. She didn't get at all impatient with us...even when I asked if we could have a room with hardwood floors (I feel like those are cleaner than carpeting)! We decided to stick with the deluxe garden view room, Room 238. The room was small, the bathroom was smaller, and the tub was very small and not very wide. It certainly wasn't what I would have expected from any other Luxury Collection hotel, but it was fine for our needs. I think it maybe would have bothered me if we had paid with cash instead of points. Anyway, the room was comfortable enough, the linens were crisp and fresh and changed daily (along with the duvet), and we had turndown service every night, with classical music playing in the room as we came back each evening. That said, i would hope that the next time we visit, that the hallways are redone and updated a bit. It looked and felt a little like a college dorm in the hallways--again, not what one expects from a Luxury Collection hotel. Throughout our stay, my husband consulted with the concierge who was great. I wish we had gotten his name--he was a redhead with blue eyes. Anyway, he was patient and helpful and always had a smile. There was one other concierge who i was less impressed with--he seemed a tad arrogant, which is kind of funny given what his job was...you'd think he'd be friendlier. Anyway, even he was fine and helpful enough. All in all our experience at the Pulitzer was lovely.

No tea & coffee in the room, (as I assume they want you to use the overpriced room service) and to cap it all, they removed the glasses from our mini-bar because we had the audacity to buy a bottle of wine from the local supermarket at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 instead of from room service at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 plus. We purchased a 'luxury package' the welcome bottle of champagne was a half of Moet, the 'Dutch Treat' was one chocolate biscuit, (for 2 people??) and we had to remind them about the flowers, which were lovely when they arrived. Maybe I am out of touch with European city centre (supposed 5 star) hotel prices, so in conclusion this is a lovely property, but I did not think either the room or the packaged deal were up to our expectations for what we paid which was pretty much \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,000 for 3 nights.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cQuirky, charming and luxurious lodgings in a great neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "Yardena", "ReviewID": "UR115868730", "Content": "We stayed at the Pulitzer for five nights in June, using Starwood Points and paying 50 euros a night for an upgraded room -- which was well worth it. The Pulitzer is formed of 20-plus canal houses connected between two main drags on the west side of the town (entrance is on Prinsengracht, and back of hotel is on Keizersgracht), so getting to your room typically involves a walk through a maze-like ground floor (around a lovely garden courtyard) and a ride up one of four different elevators. Take time to explore the way the houses are connected (with lots of glass covered walkways) -- it's fun. We liked the admittedly pricey breakfast in the main restaurant, Keizersgracht 238, with its whimsical sendup of a famous old masters painting in which the 16th (or is it 17th?) century diners are surrounded with modern day brand-name supermarket staples (e.g. Heinz ketchup if memory serves). Staff was really friendly and room was always made up when we returned, no matter how late we left. Concierge proved super helpful in finding restaurants and making reservations, and one of the managers sent us a free bottle of wine on my birthday (I guess the Starwood files have that info). We also liked the somewhat whimsical but comfortable chairs and sofas in the lobby, where you can also get a latte in the morning from the expresso bar and hang out with friends if you wish. Furnishings were what I expect in this level of hotel -- with the sole exception of the mini bar: the refrigerator wasn't working so beverages were never cold, grrrr. I also wish they had ice on the floor -- you can call for it but then you have to tip the waiter and that seems silly if all you want is ice. Still, the central location, the decor, and the generally terrific staff made this a memorable stay. We'd certainly return.

My wife and I recently spent 3 weeks in Europe staying in 4 Starwood Hotels and 3 other hotels. The service in this hotel was by far the worst. We are SPG gold members and arrived at about 2 hours before normal check-in. We were told that we could check our bags then we should come back in a couple of hours. There was no suggestion that we could go to their bar or anything, just come back. (At the Westin Paris we were 1/2 hour before normal check-in. We were told that our room wasn't quite ready yet so she called over a porter to get our bags then gave us a couple of coupons for a free non-alchololic drink). When we came back after a couple of hours she was looking at their computer screen then conversing with another employee. None of the comments were directed to us so I don't know if as a gold member she was strying to get us a nicer room or if because we booked with points she was looking for the smallest room that they had. We were given the key and told how to get to the room. That is it. No mention of their bar, restaurant, breakfast buffet... I thought that I was checking into a Holiday Inn. They were polite but that is about it. Our room was on the second floor looking out over the outdoor bar/reception area. It was the smallest room that I had ever had. Since the window looked out over this outdoor area that normally had quite a few people in it, we had to keep our drapes closed so that we has some privacy. This made the room seem even smaller. Our reservation confirmation showed that we were confirmed for a king size bed, which we obviously did not get since the room was just barely bigger than a king size bed. I e-mailed Starwood Preferred Guest Services and expressed my concern about not getting what we were confirmed for. The first response was that we were not confirmed for a king bed at the Brussels Le Meridian. I e-mailed back and expressed my disappointment that she obviously looked at my next reservation instead of carefuly reading my e-mail that I was at the Pulitzer in Amsterdam. The next response was \"here is a copy of your confirmation and I want to point out that you were confirmed for a queen bed.\" The confirmation that she sent was one that she made up on that date not a copy of the original one that I received months earlier. After asking for a supervisor the supervisor basically said that when you book a room with points nothing is guranteed, you get what is available and that is it. The overall service at this hotel is lacking. In most of the Starwood hotels that we have been to in Europe we are normally greeted by the employees when entering or leaving the hotel. Not here. When we checked out we walked out the front door and there was a light rain. We stood there a minute looking if a cab was available. The porter was just standing there and never offered to help. We ended up walking down the street as there is a cab stand behind where the Ann Frank House is. While we were at the Pulitzer there were several business groups there. It appears that these groups were what were important to the hotel. The way that we were treated made us feel like unwanted guests. I would not stay at this hotel again. While the location is nice most of the activities are down closer to Damn Square. There are a couple of true luxury hotels down there that would be a better choice. Also, SPG services is basically worthless when it comes to assisting you. My points and gold membership come from purchasing a Westin timeshare.

The Hotel Pulitzer is the second hotel I have tried. Good: It's a very interesting hotel. It's a series of the old row houses that have been jointed together and renovated into hotel rooms. The great thing about this is that the inside is really interesting, lots of passages and winding around. The negative of course is that you could receive any room from the old maids quarters to the what used to be a main room with a great view of the canal. Know that when you are booking the cheapest room in the hotel that you are probably not going to get the nicest one they have, and if you aren't spending a lot of time in your room I think the rest of the hotel is nice enough to make up for it. I booked an executive room with a canal view and was placed in a lovely room, but it's certainly not for everyone. It was on the 5th floor and overlooks the canal, but it had tiny windows, and I booked a canal room because it was July and I wanted ventilation as most hotels in Amsterdam don't seem to have real A/C. The room also was 2 story, which sounds great, until you realize that it used to be the attic, and you are basically having to go up a ladder to get to bed. It actually worked great for me because I was working most nights, and could spread out downstairs and not see it when going to bed, but any elderly person or someone with small children would not be comfortable here. The front desk must be very well trained on what rooms are acceptable and not for different guests. You might quiz them a little about your room and other types available in your price range before checking in, since it's not a cookie cutter hotel. The location is fantastic. It's very close to Anne Frank's house, lots of restaurants, and shopping. It's also close to Dam Square and the red light district if you want to go there, but not so close that you have to worry about the big crowds on the weekends, or the noise. Neutral: The breakfast buffet was included in my rate. It's a nice set up, with something for everyone, but it's 29 Euro and I probably wouldn't eat there if it wasn't included. I am a former Restaurant manager, so I know what people do to buffets and am reluctant to go through them, but they have someone who is dedicated to making sure it's refilled regularly and watches to make sure people don't sneeze on food, use fingers etc. Yes, I saw someone sneeze and the girl watch until he left and then take the food and replace it. So good there, however, the servers are obviously not trained to pick up the food plates quickly because I saw several tables get up and walk back to the buffet with their dirty plates, even though there are MANY plates to be had at every station. However, they had plenty of cheeses that were wrapped and fruit that you could peel etc, if you have a complete phobia. The 238 restaurant's food is good, and the service was great. The food at the Bar was about the room service menu, but since I don't like eating in my room that was fine. To all the American's when they say small bites they mean it. I ordered the Nicoise Salad and it was 2 pieces of Bibb lettuce, and about 3 ounces of Tuna and the regular green beans and olives etc. It's not intended as a meal, but I assumed that it was, and it was all I ordered. However, it was really tasty, great flavors, you just might make sure you order a side as well if you are used to big US portions. The guy next to me at the bar got a burger and fries, and it looked lovely, and quite large. He said it was fantastic. Also I think the bathrooms all are the same size in all the rooms. I took baths and the tub was large enough to soak in and the towels are nice big sheets instead of the tiny things that would only wrap around children. However, when I showered with the curtain in correctly it's a little narrow, and claustrophobic feeling. Also the bathroom has NO storage, so traveling alone I just set it all on the counter. If my husband had been with me, we would have had stuff all over the place. The Bad: The hair dryers. I'm a woman traveling on business from the US. I do not want to drag a huge hair dryer that is just going to break after a few days because they never seem to do well even with the converters. They still have the little tiny 1200 watt dryers that hang on the wall and you have to hold on the switch. REALLY???? I heard at least 5 comments on the crappy dryers while at breakfast. The hotel offers to make hair dresser appointments for you when you complain. NOT quite what I was looking for. There are no coffee makers in the room. Seriously, it's a 5 star hotel room, and you can't put in a Napresso? You don't have to supply a lot of stuff, but being able to come back to the hotel and relax with a tea or coffee while working and not having to wait on room service is one of my favorite things. I was really excited about Pulitzer, because I could get my Starwood points, and the location is Fantastic for a woman alone. But will probably look elsewhere next time. Yep the hair dryer and coffee machine are that important.

A lot of the plaster was stripped away to show the 18th century brick work. The view was of an external smoking area and a deep light well with a single plant tub at the bottom. The Bose bedside radio was partly off the small bedside tables and the room was so small that when the two porters arrived to deliver our two cases and a single hand luggage (why two?) my partner had to go into the bathroom to make room for them! They left the luggage on the floor rather than on the luggage rest (which as there were two of them didn't leave much space to erect the same).

The staff are helpful, courteous and professional- even when they are being swamped by guests checking in/out. I have stayed in several different room types and they have all been well appointed and comfortable. The canal-view rooms are the most desirable but they do get traffic noise. On my last visit I was in an attic room that was quiet but didn't have a great view. The interior of the Pulitzer could probably do for a makeover- the halls and stairs are getting a bit warn but the common areas- reception, lounge, gardens and breakfast room are in better nick. I am especially fond of the bar. It has two large rooms with tall windows overlooking a canal. It is comfortable, the service is not intrusive and there is no blaring music. A very nice place to relax. The breakfast is good but expensive. There are many small cafes in the area and I would recommend trying them first. They added an espresso bar since my last visit and it's a nice touch. As with most European hotels, the wi-fi is slow and expensive (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac19 for 24 hours) so avoid it if you can. The gym is small but functional. If you are not dragging along too much luggage, you can easily walk from the central station- it takes about 15-20 minutes. Dutch taxis are some of the most expensive in Europe and the ones the hotel calls seem to be even pricier. Best to go to a taxi rank or take a tram. The areas directly west and south of the hotel are filled with great little shops and restaurants. Walking north-east lands you amongst the horrid dives and clip-joints that make up central Amsterdam- avoid at all costs!

First night was a disaster....The room we got was very nice....comfortable bed, nice linens, good bathroom with the tub....super clean! Room was on the first floor overlooking the hallway. Not much fresh air, but who cares when air condition is on. Guess again....air condition was not running and nobody told us. 3AM I woke up feeling like I was in the sauna. I called reception and they brought a ventilator/fen pretty quick and we attempted to sleep the rest of the night, but it was not easy cause it was still pretty hot and we could not open windows cause people were walking passed out windows all the time. Next morning I asked to be moved to a room higher up, so we can have the windows opened since finally we were told that they are having problems with air condition and working around the clock to fix it. However we were denied a request to move with lame explanation that it's pretty warm weather for Amsterdam and even on the higher floor with windows open we will not get any fresh air and we need to wait for the air condition to be fixed which will solve all the problems and that they are booked solid. We were offered more fans and more water if we need it. When we returned in the afternoon nothing was fixed and in our room was impossible to breath. I went to the reception and said that I want to be moved to the higher floor and I will complain to Starwood if I have to. And suddenly there was a room available and since we were on our way to an excursion this room would wait for us since hotel suddenly is not that booked. The room was just as nice and just as clean, so no complains there. Overlooking the small court yard we were able to keep window open all day long and got some fresh air at night, even though it was not enough and 2 fans helped. Fixed air condition was not working at all....perhaps Amsterdam is not used to such warm weather. But since global warming is a reality, I can not imagine how uncomfortable it is in this hotel during summer months. On the good note....staff is pretty helpful and well trained... We saw people paying tips to the concierge for some advice, I find it interesting since it's their job to help with restaurant and excursion reservations.Perhaps they have to deal with more delicate requests on occasions.... Location is superb..still in the center of the city but away from most touristy noisy streets. Breakfast is outragesly expensive.

However, though it didn't turn out bad as a hotel, but certainly didn't give us a \" wow\" as Des Indes did in Den Haag. First, about the room. As a SPG platinum member, the front desk, specially, told us that we were given an upgrade to an EXECUTIVE room. The room though spacious, there are some disappointing facts: The bath room is extremely small - no separate shower and bath but a shower in a very TINY bath. Only ONE 500ml complimentary bottled water for 2 GUESTS??? There's no tea/coffee facilities(compliments) in the room at all, which I find it very very strange!! Many Starwood hotels we stayed even have coffee machine in the room (eg, Des Indes, Sharaton in Shanghai China, Le Meridien in Brussells), or at least has a kettle and instant coffee & tea bags; but in this EXECUTIVE ROOM, NOTHING??? I know, if I call room service they will bring hot water, but I guess, with the amount of the guests they have, it takes min. 15 - 20 mins wait for any one to provide any service to the room ( I will talk about this in service area). And the room we had is just by the corner of the corridor on the ground floor, we hear everything going on outside, especially when kids running around, and we could not open all the curtains, because then, we are transparent passer-by at the corridor... So I have to say, though the decoration's nice, the bed is comfy, but I wasn't so happy with the room. Now, service: Indeed, every one's trying hard and friendly, but to be on the top notch classic hotel, I think the training and the details are not good enough. While we checked in we ask concierge to book two restaurants for us, one for the night, one for the next; when we came back later that afternoon, we did received a little card on the table saying that the restaurant was confirmed for the night; so we just presumed that next night will be no problem too. Not until the next evening when we got back to the hotel feeling tired and asked the concierge if he could call the restaurant to cancel the reservation, only then we discovered that, in fact the restaurant was never booked at all, no one had followed up... LUCKILY, we didn't want to go, what happen if we had gone to the restaurant and turn away with no reservation? As there's no kettle, I called for hot water for my medicine, it takes about 20 mins for them to come; same for the computer technician to come to check on the internet connection, also around 20 mins... And though the bath room's clean, but the crew were careless, the amenities were not replenished properlyl, we found no shower caps, cotton buds, etc... Had to call house keeping, and again guess how long they before they turn up?... Any way, over all, I found the hotel interesting;and it's in a very lovely neighborhood, prime position next to the canal; and all the staff really willing and trying, but I guess just some fine details and finesse were still missing~", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piqua, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent staff and great location\u201d", "Author": "wpmurphy", "ReviewID": "UR106958967", "Content": "My hotel stay was outstanding!

At the bar, it took a while before I could ask for the drinks menu, and (upon selecting both drinks and something to eat) I went back to the barman. I asked whether the kitchen was still open, as a burger was taken to guests at a neighbouring table just as I was walking up to the bar), and I failed to understand his reply - perhaps because of the noise of the busy bar, perhaps because Dutch didn't seem to be his mother tongue.

We flew into Amsterdam rather early on a red eye flight and went up to the reception desk at this hotel rather bleary-eyed and begged for any available room. They were very kind but said they could not check us in until noon at the earliest, but that was 3 hours earlier than their usual check-in time, so they did the best they could. In the meantime, we enjoyed a free breakfast in their incredibly elegant and beautiful restaurant which was in the hotel. To get there, we walked through their courtyard and garden and looked at the paintings and sculptures in their art gallery. Yes, they have their own art gallery. Breakfast was amazing. They have a pastry table, a fruit salad plate, and a hot buffet with eggs, bacon, sausage, and, of course, crepes and pancakes. We wandered around Amsterdam and came back at noon and they gave us a room with a terrace on the courtyard, literally 2 steps away from their Espresso Bar and courtyard. This was beneficial in some ways and challenging in other ways. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept well. However, we were on the first floor and near the espresso bar, so we would get woken up most mornings by noise fr the espresso machine and deliveries, etc. The walls are thin and we had to wear ear plugs most nights to get to sleep. The bathroom was elegant and beautiful, but the tub was narrow and deep, causing me to slip and trip getting into and out of it. There was plenty of hot water. The room is itself composed of hardwood floors and a cathedral ceiling. Another aspect of this hotel that we liked was that it located 3 blocks from the Anne Frank House and 1 block from the nearest Tram stop. It is also 1 block from Westerkerk, a large church with a high spire that we could easily spot if we were lost or trying to get oriented to the geography of the city. The location of the hotel to the Tram stop was key for me.

I also loved the room I stayed in, it was really cozy and inviting.

We had a deluxe room overlooking the central garden and cathedral next door. While the room was not large (by N. American standards) it had CHARACTER. Vaulted ceilings, exposed wood, large original windows, dutch tiles in the bathroom. While we could not see the canal, we had a lovely view of the rooftops and the sunrise was breathtaking --- not to mention the soothing churchbells! Really set the mood of the place. Indeed, every room is unique and different. Last time we stayed here we were lucky enough to get upgraded to a business room overlooking the canal. While that was fantastic, I can't really say the room was any nicer (apart from being slightly larger) than the deluxe room we had this most recent stay. Amenities in the room were up to the level of a 5 star. Since it was winter, the heating in the room was perfect, including the HEATED bathroom floor! Nice touch. Slippers and cozy bathrobe was perfect as well. We replaced the feather duvet/pillows with foam, but it was still one of the best hotel sleeps I have ever had. Since this is Europe and a 5 star I think they just expect you to pay through the nose for niceties such as coffee/tea, breakfast ect... but what can I say, it was all worth it. Sure coffee to your room is about $10 a person, but they serve it with a smile, and it tastes so good. The room service was fast, the concierge knowledgeable. If you can get a good rate on the breakfast package do not hesitate to do so (especially if you like to eat a heavy breakfast!) You'll get your money's worth. There is a large supermarket 5 minute walk down the block if you want to purchase cheap snacks and booze. ;) This hotel is of course all about the ambiance, if you don't like the idea of paying extra for the privilege to wonder about winding and creaky hallways and corridors to find your room, this hotel might not be for you.

The staff were very friendly and all spoke English quite well, perhaps better than many native speakers. The hotel is on right on a canal and from the outside, is indistinguishable from the other canal houses that line the streets of Amsterdam. It's quaint but comfortable. It was really quite pleasant. The hotel's website mentions that the hotel is a series of interconnected canal houses. This makes some of the hallways labyrinth-like and may not be the best choice for people who have mobility issues. However, if you're perfectly mobile, the movement from one house to another is perceptible, but adds to the charm of it all. My room was on the 5th floor and afforded a view of the hotel's interior courtyard. Not a bad view, but a canal-side room would have been much better. However, my room was deathly quiet at night, which was a considerable bonus. The room itself was quite spacious and the vaulted ceilings made the room quite airy. The bathroom was a bit small but amenities and hardware fit nicely. The shower, however, may be too cramped for anyone even slightly taller than average. Water pressure was great, though temperature fluctuated every so slightly. The daily bottle of water and stroopwaffle cookies were a pleasant touch. The linens and decoration were very nice and gave the room a very classy-yet-homey feel. The heating system was very efficient and lent to the coziness of the room. The location is excellent. Three trams and several buses stop within a 1-minute walk from the hotel. From there, you can go anywhere in the city. Plus, the Anne Frank house is a 3-minute walk, as are several sights in the city. It's a tiny bit on the outskirts of the main downtown area, but it's nothing a short walk or tram ride can't cure. A few cons: Internet connectivity was expensive. It really irritates me when a 2-star hotel provides free internet but a member of the \"Luxury Collection\" of Starwood charges exorbitant fees for what is nowadays a requirement akin to running water. I requested a queen-sized bed...and reserved just that. However, my room had two twin beds, pushed together, made with separate linens. I effectively reserved/paid for a queen bed but slept in a twin bed with another twin bed right next to me remaining unused for the duration of my stay. I feel this is highly misleading, especially to couples traveling together that may want to share a bed. The hotel really needs to advertise this more clearly on their website. But, to the hotel's credit, the bed was quite comfortable and I slept very soundly. The elevator was unbearably slow, to the point that I rarely used it to climb all five floors; it simply wasn't worth the wait for the elevator to arrive followed by the tortoise-pace climb up to my floor. Overall, I had a very positive experience. The cons, generally, are a Starwood Hotels issue, and not necessarily limited to the Pulitzer, so I suggest potential guests take that into account when looking at the Pulitzer.

Made up of 13 traditional Amsterdam row houses on Keizersgracht (canal) and 12 on Prinsengracht, it is not exactly ADA friendly. The connector halls go up and down stairs - some quite challenging. I've taken my parents to this hotel and made sure to secure a room near an elevator because many rooms are not at all accessible if walking up and down stairs is a challenge. But, despite the odd configuration the hotel is very charming! The service is discrete and polite. The restaurant and bar are inviting (breakfast service is very good by Amsterdam standards). The gym is tiny but I rarely run into other guests using that facility. It is a romantic, historic and interesting hotel. Not everyone will love it though. The bath is small and depending on which room you get, it may have an odd layout given that it is a room in an old row house. The bedding is wonderful and I always sleep quite well there. The best attribute of the Pulitzer is the location. It is close to all Amsterdam attractions and nestled in the \"nine sisters\" area...an area of nine small streets of shopping, bars, cafe's etc. I always opt for a canal view room, but they can be loud - - a courtyard room is a better bet for light sleepers.

Not my first trip into Amsterdam and certainly not my last, but can say with confidence that this hotel will not see me stepping foot in it again unless major structural changes in the management happen. Being my second stay, I really had hope that things would be different this time around, but it was not to be. 1. Front desk staff who would launch into a tirade when room key cards don't work Having to endure a 10-minute lecture from the front desk team on how the key cards should not be stored together with other electromagnetic devices such as mobile phones, iPod's, etc. - obviously something that was prevalent among many guests or this \"electromagnetic\" lecture would not have surfaced. A genuine luxury hotel would have apologized profusely that the key cards didn't work, and would have done something about the system if there were enough complaints / inconvenience to the guests to justify. And no, I did not keep my key cards with my mobile phone, iPod or whatever. The cards simply did not work for whatever reason. I was and am still not interested in explanations and lectures. 2. Concierges who are really nice, but have no clue. Wake up calls that were not done, newspapers that were not delivered are among the many things that didn't quite pass the mark of a decent hotel, what more a \"luxury\" one. Borderline patronizing in my opinion. 3. Front desk staff that gave the \"You are an idiot and I'm doing you a favour\" vibe. I spoke with the front desk staff member because I doubt very much the concierge would be able to assist me RELIABLY. And seriously, if it pains you to call and confirm an airport shuttle, you should not be in this job in the first place. Rolling your eyes indignantly, did not help either. 4. Trainees left unsupervised at the front desk, poor handling of common questions and product knowledge. Answers to common questions like \"what time is breakfast?\" were met with \"please wait a moment, I need to check\". \"Could you please book and confirm an airport shuttle tomorrow at 1100hrs\" were met with \"I need to check whether we can do this (or not)\". Understandably, they are trainees and are trying to their best, but what is most surprising is that permanent staff members on duty standing 1 foot away from the mentioned trainee, did not even bother to intervene to assist although they were not doing anything at all. In conclusion, I personally find the hotel's level of (non) service repellent, especially given the price levels the rooms are going for. One notable exception was breakfast service which was good. It is also obvious to me that they are not too bothered by this. A shame for such a charming property. The stark difference and lack of consistency of service from an exceptional Luxury Collection (Grande Bretagne Athens), to this \"exceptional\" \"Luxury Collection\" is shocking. Wrote to corporate customer services in Starwood and was replied immediately with an apology and compensation - a sign that these issues were not new.

Located in 28 row houses between Prinsengracht and Kiesergracht, the hotel just two blocks south of West Church (Westerkerk), the Anne Frank Museum, and the cannal bus stop for the red and yellow lines. Pulitzer is also is adjacent to the Jordaan shopping area and short one kilometer walk to Koninklijk Paleis and \"The Dam.\" The decor is understated but comfortable and the property offers all the basic amenities including an espresso bar, restaurant, and cocktail lounge. We spent our evenings unwinding in the bar. Though it was a bit expensive, the staff is terrific and has wonderful insights on sightseeing and local dining tips. They also make a great Manhattan. No two rooms in the hotel are alike, and getting to your room can be a journey as you cross through corridors and move up/down stairs and through small elevators just to reach your room. Still, the experience is fun and the rooms are very comfortable. We stayed in a terrific canal view room with one of the most comfortable beds I even had in a hotel. The hotel offer wired and wireless Internet in the rooms. the bathrooms are a bit small but well appointed. The Hotel Pulitzer can be reached on foot from the central train station but I wouldn't recommend it for most people. Instead, consider a cab ride for about 12 euros. If you want to take a taxi directly to/from the airport, the trip will cost you about 40-50 euros during peak hours, but you sometimes negotiate a rate of about 35 euros in the late evening or early morning. During your stay I highly recommend a canal bus pass for at least a day. Its a fun way to get around the city, especially when you're tired after walking or riding bikes. The pass allows you to hop on/off at over 40 stops around the city.

Odd sort of room but hey, this is Amsterdam and you have to expect surprises given the architecture. Bathroom very small but clean. My wife commented on the fact that the shower curtain appeared to be new - replaced with every new guest she wondered?If so-impressive. Booked a trip on the hotel boat.

It wasn't quite a canal view, but if you looked out the window, you could see it (more on this in a few). The hotel is really cool. It's 25 canal houses comprising an entire square block between the Keizergracht and the Prinsengracht. Right on the fringe of the Jordaan, and about a 10 minute walk from Dam Square/RLD, you really couldn't get a better location in Amsterdam. Labyrinthian would be the best word to describe the inside of it. There are multiple courtyards in between the houses, which makes for a really beautiful scene when it's nice out. Our room was as quiet as you could get I think (albeit a little bit of a challenge to find when....*ahem*.. inebriated at night), and was bigger than most (I'm guessing) with a large bathroom (others mentioned small bathrooms, which isn't a big deal to me, personally - ours was huge though). The neighborhood is quiet in its own right, so the noisy people on the canals wouldn't really be a huge problem anyway - it's far enough from the main night life that this would only be an issue until 11pm tops. The service was excellent, our rooms were sparkling, and the staff was very helpful. The only cons I suppose would be the fact that Wifi costs money (it's 2010 people...), and the breakfast is outrageously, almost extortionately expensive.

This first room though small, was adequate, but had no view, only of a the other hallways and the elevator. Still, for what we paid, I was ok with this. The problem was the bathroom which was very tiny. The shower head attachment was broken so it would slide down to waist level. The shower curtain was not what I would call luxurious by any stretch. And then, in this particular room (don't remember the room number... 170 something?) there was an awful odor. I've read other reviews saying that they've smelled something similar. Having been to Amsterdam there is often this canal old water kind of smell from the drain and that's I think what this was. Luckily when I complained the upgraded us to a much better room and that is where the attached pictures are from. And that was a totally different experience. In the new room we had three windows overlooking the Prinsengracht canal. It was a large room with a luxurious bathroom and beamed ceilings and really just an incredible arrangement. I imagine that this room was not even close to our price range. Long story short, I've been to the city many times and if you are trying to book their most inexpensive room I would opt for renting an apartment or a houseboat, which won't have the service that this hotel has, but will have a larger more authentic feel.

We were incredibly delighted and relieved with our choice. The Pulitzer faces one of the canals, is on a quiet street and has a lovely spacious lobby. The staff greet you in a very Americanized smiley/happy way, which is something I love. Very genial and pleasant without any air of falseness about them. We were checked in very quickly. Whenever I check into a hotel I always request to be placed in a room on a high floor, as far away from the lift as possible and in a corner room if there's one available. This ensures you're going to get a quiet room, with little outdoor foot traffic and because it's on a corner might only share one wall with another hotel room. Sometimes this technique works, sometimes it doesn't. This time it most certainly did. Our room was accessed through several corridors, small stairs up and down, around a corner, up more stairs and then onto a small landing that we shared with only one other room across the hall. We never once heard any other guests. The room had incredibly high ceilings (for a top floor room) where the attic had been converted and broken through from the floor below, where our room was. It was airy and bright and felt very spacious. The bathroom was small and had a bath with a step-in shower, which I never like, but it was certainly adequate. Any staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. Any of the room service staff that came to our room were gracious, smiley and polite. The concierge was very helpful and informative. The hotel is a stones throw from Anne Frank's house, so there are plenty of bars, restaurants and convenience stores around the corners. I found the price to be very reasonable, certainly not extortionate. I would have given this a 5 star review but for the bathroom.

Even more, we liked the area that the hotel is in much better than the city center. Great restaurants within a block or two - Envy and Pancakes! (mmm poffertjes) were particular favorites. And we walked down to the Leidesplein on a couple of nights to catch live music - again, just about 10 minutes beautiful walk (or 3 minute bike ride) down the canal. Anne Frank house is 150 meters away - we kept checking the line until we got a chance to walk in one evening with absolutely no line and just 4 or 5 people inside. Great little neighborhood pubs just around the corner. And for strolling, nothing beats the Jordaan anyway -- just across the canal. Rooms were not huge, but nicely appointed and the staff was accommodating. Rooms were also very unique - not another generic hotel room. Ours had a huge high ceiling with large open beams and a huge window that swung wide open onto the canal - very cool. Nice to feel like you're in Amsterdam even when the door shuts to your room - and not be in another room that feels like a business trip! Bed was awesome, and may have cost me a couple grand in replacing our bed at home. It's become my wife's new Gold Standard for mattresses. Overall, we loved the feel of the hotel. It is a bit of a maze, but that really adds to the unique character of the hotel. It is really neat to look out the window of one of the famous canal houses and actually be staying in one! Pulitzer nicely combines the quaintness of a B&B with the privacy and amenities of a large hotel. I think they had a couple of trainees at the desk when we were there, so it wasn't a high point of the hotel experience - but all of the staff were very helpful if you stopped and asked them a question. Good travel advice from the concierge on getting to Brugge by train. The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey, but it was outstanding - try it at least one morning. Tip - rent bikes when you get there and park them in the front of the hotel for the duration of your trip. By far the best way to get around and just adds a great feel to the whole trip. We went into the rental shop around the corner (across from Westerkirk) and didn't get a great feel for the place as others were returning their bikes. We opted instead for Bike City on the Bloemgracht on the other side of the Prinzengracht a couple of blocks away toward Anne Frank house and they were very friendly and the bikes were great.

We were happy to pay a luxury price for a luxury experience. But on the first night (June 2) we were awoken about 11 pm by people entering the room above and making a good deal of noise as they apparently moved in, for about 45 minutes. It was irritating, but we understand that late arrivals occur. The wooden floors transmit footsteps, especially shoe-steps, to the room below much more than carpet would. (note the previous review) We got back to sleep after midnight. On the second evening, about 6 pm while we were relaxing before dinner, they came back to the room and were very noisy, both heavy continuous walking and argumentative talking. After 30 minutes, we were very concerned about the prospects for later in the night, so my husband went down to speak to the desk about getting a different room. No other room was offered, but security went up to tell them to be quiet--we could hear him at their door and then they were quiet. After coming back for dinner and going to sleep, we were awoken at 2 am by more loud noise. At 2:30 my husband went back down to the desk to request help. We could then hear the knock at their door to again tell them to be be quiet. This was nearly 3 am. They were quiet then, but we did not get back to sleep and had to be up before 6 in order to eat and make our plane. So both of our nights' sleep were interrupted, the second ruined, by this repeated noise. The only compensation we were offered was waiver of the 19 euro (rip-off) internet fee. So I asked to be contacted by the manager. His email: \"Of course it is not good to read that you have had some inconvenience during your stay. I did some research myself about your complaint. The guest above you gave the hotel in general a lot of trouble. It is not an excuse from our side but only that you are aware what happened and that this is an exceptional and unfortunate incident. I do have to say that indeed the wooden floors give somewhat more noise than carpet but this was a situation we almost never experience. On a next visit we will give you a nice upgrade. Also I will give you 5000 SPG points.\" My response: You acknowledge that the wooden floors are noisy and that the guests above us created other problems. Your offer is for a future upgrade and hotel points that are worth about 1/3 of one night's stay at your hotel. We paid 689 euros for these two nights, both of which our sleep was interrupted or ended. $848. His response: \"From your reply I get the impression you feel offended by the email I send you. This was however never the intention of my email. The reason why we do not give you back a full night complementary is because the inconvenience is not directly caused by the hotel. Another guest has made the disturbance and we as a hotel took our responsibility and took action where needed. As we do appreciate your feed-back and are sorry that your stay was not up to your expectation due to the noise disturbance, we would like to offer you 8000 SPG points for the inconvenience caused including a free upgrade on your next visit. We do feel this a very reasonable gesture on our side.\" Starwood replied, when contacted by us, that the hotel had responded sufficiently.

Cons: The room decor. While the size of the room was ok, the furniture was both unattractive and odd; heavy wood of no discernable style (looking a bit long in the tooth) and as someone else noted placed oddly (probably cause of configuration of the old canal houses) making it hard to put suitcases down, etc. The bed was great, as is typical at all Starwoods, but the only chair in the room -- an odd yellowish velour -- had a huge stain.

Pulitzer was the highlight of the trip. Stayed at all cat 5 or 6 Starwood properties the whole trip, and Pulitzer wins the prize. Why? 1) The location is amazing. Amsterdam is a small city, to be sure, very walkable, etc. But this location is on the prettiest stretch of the canal ring, facing both Prinsengracht and Keisergracht canals, a block away from Anne Frank haus, adjacent to Jordaan neighborhood to the west and The Nine Streets shopping district to the south. 2) The concept of taking 25 canal houses, and attaching them altogether to get one hotel is great, and it's done very well. It's interesting - the floors don't exactly match up from one house to the other, so there are these interesting split level-ish stairs as you transition from one building to the next, but all of it adds to its character and is done well, not just \"duct-taped together\" 3) Nicely furnished, good amenities - probably the best hotel bed I have ever slept on. And I've slept on LOTS, as I travel tons for work, and then I travel some more for pleasure. Nice modern furnishings, lamps, chairs, etc. Clean bathrooms with good robes, good toiletries. The usual understandable things like slightly slower drain, etc. But you know what? I've stayed in plenty of expensive places where the shower drain was slow and they did not clean up after it, which is what makes it gross. This place, not so - the tub was spotless and shiny clean each day. 4) Canal views are wonderful, but I got a courtyard view this time and it overlooked the garden - very quiet, very nice. 5) It's clean. I can't tell you how important that is. Nothing is more frustrating than experiencing that \"ick\" factor from dirty corners or stained bedskirts etc etc when you stay in what is supposed to be a top-notch place (see my review of Prince de Galles) 6) It just works. When you come \"home\" to the Pulitzer after a long day of walking around, it is clean, it is peaceful, it is nice, and you're happy and relieved to be there. It's not superfluous or overly ornate or overly \"done up\" - it's just luxurious enough to be comfortable, nothing more. I had a Deluxe room (290). Big, plenty of space. Could not hear the neighbors. 7) The breakfast was included in my rate (I think due to SPG platinum status) and was very good.

We had the unique experience of checking-in twice and using two different rooms. First, the property is a very beautiful location in the \"Nine Streets\" area of the Western Canal Belt. It provides really easy foot access to Dam Square, Leidsplein, Museumplein and the Jordaan. The location could not be any better. Arriving from the US, we knew we might have to wait to check-into the hotel. The front desk was very pleasant in terms of communication and service. We just wish we could have checked-in earlier. However, this seems to be de rigeur for most European properties. To add to their woes, the Icelandic volcano had erupted, so guests were probably hesitant to check-out. The first room that we had was wonderful. It was wonderful and faced the courtyard below. Though it was small, it had a very pleasant layout and a charming bathroom. Blackout curtains lined the windows. We slept very well with no interruptions whatsoever. The room type we booked was \"Executive\". This was an amazing kickoff to our stay in Amsterdam. By the way, try Cafe Duende in the Jordaan for authentic Spanish tapas. It was delicous and priced well. Very happening scene for all ages. In addition, you should book a room rate at the Pulitzer that includes breakfast. The breakfast buffet selection is nothing short of amazing, the staff is friendly, and the setting is charming. On our return to Amsterdam, we checked in again. We were quickly given the key to our room. This room was a little different from the first. This room was very large. It had beautiful architectural details with beams that lined the A-frame ceiling of the canal house. All this beauty comes with a price. Unlike the first room, this room was not as well insulated. We could hear the houskeeping singing while cleaning the next room as well as the antics from another couple in the room next door. To add to this, the room was close to the bell tower of the church. Stunning beauty that requried earplugs. Overall, this hotel's location and staff were truly amazing. The room quality varies from one room to another.

The personal touch and her friendliness really came through. She is excellent at her job and made our stay far beyond our expecations. Sometimes, hotels managed by a large chain can be impersonal.

We had 2 separate stays booked - the first for one night and the second for 2 nights...for two nights in between, we made a quick trip to Brussels and stayed there for two nights at the LM Brussels. Overall, we had a great experience and cannot wait to return! We landed for our first stay fairly early (around 9am) - I had been in touch with the hotel early on to check about early check-in and was advised that they would try their best to ensure a room. They also mentioned that they would charge a fee of 50 Euro if the room were to be ready before 9am (which I was fine with). The hotel had pre-upgraded us to an Exec Canal room (the standard Plat upgrade) but that room was not ready upon check in. We were given a choice of waiting for a couple of hours in order to check in to the upgraded room or check in to a regular room...given that we had just come off a 9hour flight, we decided to check in to the regular room. The room was comfortable but quite small - we were too tired in any case and just spent the day resting. We checked out the next day to go to Brussels and came back two days later to check in. The hotel had pre-upgraded us once more and gave us a choice between a Junior suite and an Exec Canal view room. The Junior suite was very quaint and we loved it, but unfortunately the beams were a little too low for us (we are both 6 ft. tall). We decided to take the Exec Canal view room which was terrific - spacious, luxurious with a fantastic view on the Prinsengracht side (See pics). We had no issues with noise as reported in some earlier posts. The hotel treats SPG Platinum guests very well - the Plat rooms are definitely a great upgrade from the regular room (MUCH more spacious and a much better view). The free breakfast provided to Plats is a nice touch - the buffet spread was great, and comes with made-to-order omelets which were superb. The internet connection was fast and worked without any problems - when we checked out, they had added the breakfast and the internet bills to our folio by mistake but readily removed them on being reminded that I was a Platinum guest. Each room also has 2 bottles of complimentary bottled water. The hotel itself is simply gorgeous- very traditional with a great location right in the heart of the Jordaan neighborhood. The rooms are fairly luxuriously appointed and were on par with other luxury properties we have stayed at (for some strange reason, the toilet paper resembled those found at airports - hope they replace it with paper of better quality). The beds at the Pulitzer have to be hands down the best beds we have ever slept in...we love the Westin and W beds but these beds blew all those out of the water. We had a really tough time waking up each morning! The hotel has a maze like interior which we had fun exploring. There are multiple wings and stairs but there are ample signs everywhere. Some of the steps were quite steep (see pics below) but we used the elevators for the most part. Overall, it never really felt like we were at a chain hotel...we felt more like being inside a house (and I mean this in a positive sense) - having access to such unique properties is one of the reasons why we continue to remain loyal to SPG . There are tons of great cafes within walking distance (Vyne, a wine bar next to the hotel was especially superb - great for dates ). There are also some good ethnic restaurants - Poorna (Indian) and Sampurna (Indonesian) both had great food and an upscale ambiance. We did not really try the restaurant at the hotel except for breakfast. The staff were exceptional - right from the front desk to the waiters at the restaurant. Everyone spoke flawless English and seemed eager to help. Unfortunately, the hotel no longer offers a local gift as a choice for Plat amenity...they did offer some cookies instead of the points and we took the points one time and the cookies the next. The hotel also runs its own 10-seater boat (the explorer) and we took a tour of the canals on it one evening...a fun experience (38 Euro each). Overall, we were very happy with our stay - I had booked this on a Cash & Points rate of $90 + 4800 Starpoints a day...and the cash rate was well in excess of 250Eur for each of those nights for the most basic room. At these rates, it was definitely great value for money...Amsterdam is a lovely city and staying at the Pulitzer made our trip even more memorable!", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location!\u201d", "Author": "Dennistravels", "ReviewID": "UR60791007", "Content": "We have been staying at Starwood hotels for a few years now after taking advantage of the Starwood Points program. The Pulitzer Hotel is in the luxury line of hotels that Starwood owns and has its own charm and personality.

One hour on the tram is 2.60 Euros, or you can purchase a 24 hour pass for 7 Euros (good value if you are planning on travelling around the city). Approx three stops from Centraal station and the hotel is within walking distance of the stop (look for the big green flags). The hotel had scaffolding on the outside but there was no active renovations taking place in the interior. We arrived early in the day but the hotel managed to get our room ready in two hours and kept our bags for us while we explored. Staff were very pleasant and attentive to our questions and requests. The room itself was cozy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hardwood floors, comfy king sized bed, in-room safe and mini-bar. The bathroom was quite spacious given that we were in a European hotel room.

There is a business centre with two computers and free internet for a limited time period. There is also one more computer in the lobby area for guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use. The concierge keeps tickets for both the Van Gogh museum and the Rijksmuseum. If you are interested in attending either of these places, purchase your tickets in advance from the hotel concierge.

It was also next to impossible to get the water temperature right. It could get scalding hot which added to the precariousness of taking a shower.

Firstly, the staff is so incredibly nice. Every single person was always smiling and so friendly. The room was absolutely gorgeous. It was huge with wood floors. The bed was so comfortable. There's free internet in the business centre which was nice as I was away for 3 weeks so didn't bring my laptop. The food in the restaurant was great but the staff was even friendlier. The first night we ate at the restaurant proper and my wife had their 3 course lobster based dinner (even the dessert has lobster in it) and I had ala carte and it was delicious. The staff was so nice and chatted with us and we even got a bonus appetizer for free. The 2nd night we decided to be cheap and so we went to the bar to get cheap burgers or the like and the bartender/waiter asked us if we were hungry. So he said... \"no problem, don't order the burger, I'm going to give you the Surprise special. Do you want meat or fish?\". We chose one of each. We said we were being cheap (but we had a Starhot card that gave us 50% off food) and he said \"don't worry, I like you, you look like a nice couple and I'm going to take care of you\". First thing he asked us was what kind of drink we wanted. We said we don't really drink alcohol as we don't like the strong taste. He said no problem. He came back with a drink that had a bit of alcohol but tasted amazing (and I hate the taste of alcohol). I think it had champagne in it. We didn't know what to expect and then the appetizer came out. We both had the same one and it was this king crab meat wrapped inside a piece of fish. It tasted amazing. The entree's came out and we were blown away. The meat plate had basically one of every type of meat offered in the regular restaurant menu and the fish plate had the same, every type of seafood. It was so good and so well made. Finally dessert. He brought out this huge platter that had one of every dessert on the menu. I think there were 8 different desserts on there. We were so stuffed at the end but we were afraid of the bill. It came out to 60 euro total so for us it was only 30 euro for 2 and he didn't even charge us for the alcohol!

The location is great, just down the road from Anne Frank House (a must visit) and canal boats leave from docks up and down the canal outside.

We had breakfast at Sarahs Pancake house (turn right outside the hotel, then the next right onto the main street and walk a few hundred metres) and it was great. Have the bacon as a side, glorious.

However, the Pulitzer was a huge disappointment. This was surprising because I had stayed in the Pulitzer about a year ago and liked it well enough to revisit. This time it was not so nice. I was charged 50 Euro for local phone calls which totaled about 20 minutes. When I checked out I was stunned by the price and asked for the manager who told me basically too bad so sad. She said there was a notice in the room and therefore I had to pay. Funny, I never saw the notice and I can tell you that I certainly would have used my cell phone if I had. It would have been much cheaper for me to roam on my cell than use the land line. But really what ticked me off was the attitude of the manager, my husband and I spend a lot of money at Starwood and I really didn't appreciate her nastiness. Especially her sarcastic \"is there anything else I can help you with\" after I paid the bill. While paying an outrageous phone bill was what tipped me over the edge, there were other things that were unsatisfactory. Everyday I was there I had to get my keys recoded as they didn't work. Housekeeping doesn't clean under the beds - which is really disgusting when you drop something and it rolls under the bed. It also looks like they don't change out the bed skirts which was obvious when I had to lift it up to get the item that rolled under the bed.

There was no better way to end our trip than relaxing in Amsterdam and have the comfort and luxury of Hotel Pulitzer. After bouncing from city to city, Hotel Pulitzer offered us the quiet environment, privacy and accomodations that we needed. We were upgraded and stayed in Room 288 - a lovely and large room with a king bedroom, 2 bathrooms, and large living area overlooking the canal parallel to Prinsengracht. The room was beautiful - the bedroom and master bath were immaculate but with retained old world charm. Because the hotel is relatively central, after each outing, we returned to the hotel to rest or have a snack or a drink. We had a small empty refrigerator in the room to leave drinks and snacks in. It is also in a very artsy, intellectual section of town where you will feel safe walking around, there are great shops, restaurants and bars, but is also quiet enough for a bit of peace. For those looking to experience the real charm that Amsterdam has to offer, Hotel Pulitzer is an amazing location. Try walking around at night nearby to see the newly renovated or very old and rustic canal houses that neighbor the hotel. The hotel staff was very helpful - we were immediately helped to check in and the hotel was able to accomodate our request (a month in advance) for a 2-hour early check in - luckily for us, they were able to reserve a room for us a bit early. The concierge was very knowledgeable and helped us to find the drop off for our car rental, gas station, train tickets for the airport, reservations for a night show, recommendations from friends on places to go and things to try (which include: 1. freshly made french fries - there are small carts in front of the large, colorful church (Western Church) which is a 3 or 4 minute walk from the hotel with different sauces and the man who works there is incredibly charming and fun to talk to 2. Long Pura restaurant - we didn't get the chance to try it, but it's very close to the hotel and is supposed to be great! 3. Pancake Bakery - a 10 minute walk, I'll be writing a review of them next, but it was a fantastic, fun experience and very good! 4.

Great hotel, friendly staff - funky layout.\u201d", "Author": "lisampls", "ReviewID": "UR46273361", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just got back from a quick 5-day in four cities Europe trip. Our last night was in Amsterdam and he wanted to use SPG points - which led us to Hotel Pulitzer. The hotel is like many hotels in Amsterdam...in converted row houses. With that, the layout is a bit funky and maze-like. Check in was very fast and we were in our (first) room within a few minutes....well, kind of. We wandered around for about 5 minutes looking for room 311 until we found two employees who helped us look (they weren't sure where it was either.) Ends up we walked right by it as it was literally off a main walkway, which was odd. To make it more odd, when we walked in there were two sets of three stairs going up on either side - kind of like a mini split level. (I'll post pics) On the left was the bath and up on the right was the bedroom area. My fear was that I'd get up in the middle of the night and take a digger down those stairs on the way to the bathroom, so my boyfriend went to the front desk and asked if we could get another room, preferrably with a canal view. He came back successful - they were moving us to a different room - which was good because he said he could actually see right into our room when he walked the main hallway back from the lobby! YIKES! SO! Onto our new and improved room! Room 217! Whew! This one made us both very happy! First and foremost, we had a lovely canal view - but the room had some very lovely features other than the view including hardwood floors and a wood-beamed ceiling - and overall it was a good size, much larger than hotels in Paris or London. There was very comfortable king bed with wonderful linens, two side tables, a desk, a chair and table, an armoire that housed an area to hang clothes (and a few drawers) and the safe. There was also a cabinet that had the TV on it that held the mini-bar. If you are staying a long time there is not a ton of space to unpack your things, but for us staying only one night it was more than adequate. The bath was small, but very nice with lots of marble and a heated floor! There is a real tub and hand-painted tiles on the wall. The sink area is small, but again, for one night it was fine for us. They had nice bath products, but felt they were on the florally side. Good for me, but perhaps a bit too feminine for my boyfriend. There is a hairdryer as well. Other stuff: * The road is right in front of the hotel, but with the windows closed we weren't really bothered by road noise. * I want to say internet was around 27Euro for 24 hours, but don't quote me on that. * We had coffee delivered the morning we left but that was it as far as us checking out their restaurant. * There are plenty of steps here and there down hallways (two or three at a time), so be prepared to lift your suitcases up and down those steps on our way in/out. * The location is very good and only a few blocks from the Anne Frank Huis. We took a cab to and from the Rijksmuseum / Van Gogh Museum because we had limited time, but we did walk to Dam Square and the Red Light District. * There are a million boutiques, bars and restaurants in every direction so it's easy to find what you're looking for - and the concierge was helpful in giving us directions and suggestions, so don't be afraid to ask for assistance. * Note that while the bars stay open late, many restuarants close by 10:00 pm, which we found disappointing. So if there is a place you have in mind, make sure you find out their hours. * One tip, we asked for a taxi to come pick us up and take us to the train station...but while we were waiting, the bellman told us we could grab a ride on the Stop and Go - a hop on/hop off van that only costs 1euro! It was perfect! And of course saved us about 15euro! We didn't explore too much of the hotel, so I can't comment on it's ammenities, but from what we did see, we were happy with our stay. Had we stayed in room 311 and had I broke my leg on those goofy steps....I'd have probably not been so happy....but we loved Room 217! With that, I'd recommend this hotel.

During this time I have probably averaged 125-150 days a year on the road with almost all properties Marriott, Westin, Ritz, Luxury Collection, etc. This hotel is among the most distressing of all the hotels I have ever stayed in. On this trip my wife was with me. The canal view rooms are very small with literally no closet space at all. There are no closets. The only space for hanging clothing is in a cabinet which also contains the only drawers. The result is the absolute inadequacy of the room. The bath rooms are similarly small. *Hot and cold water flashes occur when others turn on their showers or faucets. This happened numerous times in the five days we were there. *Lighting is inadequate in the room AND in the bathroom. *There was not a full length mirror in the entire room. *We stayed in a \"deluxe King Canal View.\" I also requested being able to see an alternative room for the second day since we were so disappointed with ours. It was no different. *We asked the concierge (one of many-often the desk clerks cover for them and don't write tasks in ledgers to note that they were done) if we needed a reservation for the hotel restaurant for dinner for two @7. They said that because it was a weeknight it should not be a problem. We could just go. An hour later when we came down (around 7:30) we walked to the nearly empty restaurant and asked for a table. We were told that they were fully booked and there was no room for us. When I mentioned that we were staying at the Pulitzer (for five days no less) and had been told by the concierge (please call!) that we did not need a reservation we were firmly told, no, they were booked. I then asked if I could have the food from the Pulitzer served in my hotel room and was told yes, \"of course.\" Then, I asked if the same kitchen was going to prepare it and they had so many empty tables, why could we not have dinner IN THE RESTAURANT? Another firm no. We left and I went to look for the concierge who was nowhere to be found. Nor the evening manager. Curiously, the next day we talked to another couple in the lobby and told them our story. They laughed and said, yes, the exact same thing had happened to them the night before! It also infuriated them. *I asked the concierge to cancel a reservation for a restaurant for one night because it was raining heavily and we did not want to walk. They told me that they would. Thirty minutes later, walking by to go to a restaurant next door I asked if they had made the cancellation. The answer was yes. That night, when we returned to our room @11:00PM there was a message on my answering machine from the restaurant understandably upset that we \"had not cancelled.\" They \"were in business to make money and had turned diners away because they saved our table for us.\" Because of us they lost several hundred Euros that evening and thanked us for our complete lack of consideration that they were operating a business.\" I was floored. I went down to the concierge and was told that she had gone home. The next day she was not in but there was a different concierge. I asked if a note had been made in the ledger for the restaurant's cancellation. There was none. Simply, this is unacceptible behavior at any hotel, by any staff but especially at a hotel on this level. *On our last day we left a wakeup call to dress for the airport. It never came! It never came! Twice, I called down to confirm that it would be done. I even called down to have a second wakeup call fifteen minutes later. That never came either. Starwood needs to take a serious look at this property-it is an absolute embarassment to be called a Leading Hotel of the World. The hotel is in an interesting location: primarily residential it is still close enough to the center of Amsterdam that I would consider it a plus. It IS charming by a larger canal and the views from the windows are lovely. But this is a hotel that is step below a Luxury Hotel because of the size of the rooms as well as the amenities (including sufficient closet and drawer space).

This is one of the rare times when I booked a hotel without much research as the hotel is the only Starwood property in the heart of Amsterdam and I was able to stay at my company's expense On the positive side, you can't beat the location of the hotel - its a short walk or quick tram ride to almost everything. There are a plethora of restaurant, bar, nightlife options that surround the hotel. The setting right by a beautiful canal is rather breathtaking at night. And the king size bed in my room was very comfortable. However, I'm at a loss at how this is a \"Luxury Collection\" property and worthy of paying Category 5 (out of 7) prices in the Starwood system. First, this property is the least attractive property for Platinum members I've ever seen (I have stayed 250+ nights in the last 3 years at SPG hotels around the world). To be fair, I booked on a sold out weekend and was not upgraded - so I won't hold this against the hotel. However, there are no real special Starwood privileges at this hotel for Platinum guests. There is no lounge. Breakfast is NOT included (rare for Plats to pay for this when there is no lounge), and neither is Internet (35 euros for 2 nights!). My room only had 1 free bottle of water that may be given to all guests. There is no happy hour for Plats. To me this is no way to treat your best customers. It seems that the experience at this property can vary by room - mine (160) was on the first floor and had very minimal lighting. I've never seen a room with less lighting. There were too many noises that could be heard in the room, from outside noise (e.g. a bell that rang at the top of every hour, even 3am) to internal plumbing. For some people this type of property is considered old school and charming. To me it felt more run down and not very luxurious at all. Even the gym that is touted on the website is quite small with a few treadmills/ellipticals and some dumb-bells - not one weight machine. The staff was OK - sometimes friendly, while other times not really paying attention. For instance, the one Plat benefit I exercised is 4pm checkout (avail at all hotels) and mentioned this to the staff the night before so it could be noted in my records. The next day I was awakened to a phone call asking me when I was checking out. It felt pretty typical of the service - inconsistent. Overall I would only stay at this property again if I didn't plan to spend much time in my room AND I was not paying the bill. Otherwise, for the high costs, there must be a better option in Amsterdam than this.

To get the major flaw out of the way, we arrived at the hotel at about 12:30 p.m., were told that our room was not ready but that it would be by the 3 p.m. check-in time, arrived back at 4:15 p.m., and the room still wasn't ready until after 5 p.m. If we weren't jet-lagged and exhausted, and if this wasn't a \"Luxury Collection\" hotel with high standards, this would not have bothered us. And I realize that the hotel was pretty full while we were there. Still, under the circumstances, it was a real drag. The few minor quirks involve some inconsistent concierge information and availability, a few funky aspects of the hotel (such as the elevators), a breakdown of communications between the front desk and the doorman regarding our taxi request when we departed, and a bit of rudeness from the doorman. On balance, though, we had a very nice stay. The aforementioned quirks notwithstanding, most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Due to my Starwood Gold status and/or because I shelled out some extra points (14.5K as opposed to 12K) for a better-than-regular room, we had a very nice room on the top (5th) floor, overlooking the canal and with a staircase leading up to a sleeping loft from the small living room below. Not recommended for folks who have trouble navigating narrow stairways or who might make frequent bathroom trips during the night, but we liked it. And not super-deluxe by luxury hotel standards--but like the hotel as a whole (which comprises about 25 former townhouses that have now been connected), it was charming in a quirky (in a positive sense) sort of way. I suspect the canal view room is noisier than one overlooking the hotel courtyard--I slept with earplugs in--so it's a bit of a trade-off. Also, as others have noted in other posts, staying in a regular room on the ground floor might make the place considerably less charming. The hotel does have a great location, very central so that in one direction you can delve into the tourist heartland and in others you easily get a bit off the beaten track. Breakfast buffet was nothing outstanding, but certainly sufficient and served in pleasant surroundings with efficient staff. Also, at least on the weekend days we were there, it was served until 1 p.m., which was great.

We never ate at the restaurant, but we did enjoy the bar one evening. Our cocktails were superb. A little pricey but what do you expect from a hotel of this caliber? The bartender, as with everyone else in the hotel, was again just as friendly to us and acted as if we had known him for years. The hotel location, as stated by everyone else, is indeed in a terrific spot. It's close enough to pretty much everything to walk to, and if you don't want to you simply take the trams. It takes a little while to get your bearings but once you do you can easily navigate the streets and canals of Amsterdam. Use the maps the hotels give you when you check in and you should be fine. I bought a laminated street map before we left the States and never used it, the one they gave was superb! Now, here's the issue we ran in to. We had a 6pm flight out, and had reservations for the Connexxion shuttle bus to pick us up. We asked the concierge what time we should have them pick us up and he instantly said \"4:00 will give you plenty of time to get there\". I questioned him on the 4:00 time, thinking 3pm might be better, but he insisted it was just fine to leave at 4. So, I trusted his knowledge and went with it. 4:20 came and the shuttle finally arrived to pick us and another couple up. Unfortunately we weren't going straight to the airport. We had to drop another couple off at another hotel, then pick another couple up to take TO the airport. By the time we got to Schipol it was 5:30pm. We actually made it onto the flight (after having to run through the airport to get on the plane as they called us over the intercom to rush there as they were holding the plane for us). Unfortunately, our luggage did not make our flight and we got to our next destination without them for the night. Luckily the bags made it out on a later flight and we got them the next morning for our journey back home, but it was an unnecessary inconvienience we had to deal with because the concierge insisted 2 hours was plenty of time.

All dishes were presented beautifully. About $100 per couple. Each couple shared an appetizer, we had no beverages, no desert and we each had a drink or wine.

Yet, there is still room to improve in both hardware (amenities) to be substantially qualified as Luxury collection. Location: Impeccalbe quiet, picturesque location, you can almost walk to all tourist attractions. Stop and Go bus (Euro 1/hour) stop in front of the hotel, Canal bus stop is just a stroll away. Ann Frank House & West Church is just around the corner. We are glad that we chose Pulitzer. Service: Overall the staff are very helpful and friendly. All the front desk staff are nice. (some posters said they were cold, not that we had encountered). The concierge is helpful and knowledgeable. The porter, some are cold, but Carlos is an excellent exception, Carlos is cheerful , helpful and make you feel warml welcomed. The housekeeping staff are also very friendly and efficient. There was no turn down service. The business center offer free internet access, you still can have internet access without paying the Euro19 /day internet charges. Room The featured rate is not really low at this economic turmoil. yet we got a 30% off at SPG.com which si a steal. So our room of course is not the most desirable. In light of the hotel is a link of many canal houses into a quadrangle, so there are many short flights of stairs linking the buildings and level. I now know what does one poster talk about room under the stairs. I at first worry too. In fact, the room was in a good size, very bright, facing the inside small courtyard, no view, in the front building . Some rooms are in the back canal houses, you have to walk through a patio courtyard There is free coffee/tea maker but you have to ask upon check-in. The tiny squishy bathroom is a fact. The amenities in the room is ok. I was surprised, there is no cosmetic cotton wool, cotton buds and show cap which are very standard in 5-star hotels in Europe. The faucet in the bathtub link with the rainforest shower head is a bit tricky to adjust. Some posters mentioned about the physical placement of the furniture in the room. I agree. The bed is very comfy. Restaurant: Unfortunately, the Pulitzer restaurant was closed for renovation and the menu is disappointing. There are many cafe, restaurants nearby, The Michelin mentioned restaurant Envy is just a stroll away. It's a nice restaurant with good tasting menu. I echo to the concierge if you want a quiet dinner, then don't pick the bistro (tapas) style ENVY. We enjoyed the food at ENVY. Transport The hotel canal cruise sails at 6pm it is nice. If you are short of time, don't ever buy the canal bus day pass, the canal bus(boat ) is too slow and frequency is 25mins. The tram daypass (7 Euro) takes you everywhere. I believe taxi from Amsterdam Centrale station is around 10Euro, we got ripped off for 16Euro. If you go to the airport, order a airport shuttle from the concierge, it costs 14.50Euro per person, pick up from hotel to the airport, the shuttle may have to pick up passengers from other hotels. We were lucky, there were only two of us on the shuttle that only took 20mins to Schipol airport.

The bathroom was beautiful marble, and the furniture/decor very tasteful without being fussy. The ultimate attraction to the room however, was the bed! There are so many reviews on here about the beds in this hotel, and they're all truE. Firstly it was HUGE! The mattress was amazing, so comfortable, and the bedlinen was divine. Although we didn't spend much time in the room (how could you in such a beautiful city?!) it was wonderful to come back to after a long day sightseeing. The hotel is in the most fantastic postion, right bang in the centre of the most impressive district of Amsterdam. The canal houses it is situated in a sympathetically restored, and the bar had a wonderful view out onto other such buildings and the canal. This is the district to be in, the shops are amazing and there are som many cafes and restaurants nearby. We had an excellent expererience at this hotel, and would definately stay here again (although we always make it a rule of thumb to never stay in the same place twice!)

I took it as they could offer a good deal on 2 night stay and as it was a Starwood hotel and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the Starwood Preferred Guest program. I had to pay 207\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night for the room. First of all: you got to love the internet. Yes, I did book the hotel through the internet (on the Starwood page) and I also used http://www.maps.google.com to check which was the nearest tram station and which line would service that station. So when I arrived at Schiphol airport I took a train into downtown (centralstation) and from there I jumped on the right tram line and jumped of at the right station\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it is Westermarkt by the way :-) When I arrived, the check in was fast and I got room 331. The guy that checked me in was very helpful and pulled out a map to show us where we were located and I also asked if he could recommend a restaurant near by and he booked a table for me at Moeders (Mothers) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that is a different story. Room 331 is located on the 2nd floor and the first impression when walking in was quite good. At first glance it was a room with light wooden floors, light walls, golden curtains and big beams in the ceiling. It is also located right next to a canal so the surroundings are quite picturesque - not that I got to experience much of that as I got windows facing a courtyard ;-) When I first came in I had a lot of problems figuring out how to turn on the light. But after fiddling around with the light switches I finally figured it out. The room was dominated by a huge bed which turned out to be very comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it even had a proper duvet and some nice pillows. Apart from that there was a nice flat screen TV on top of a mini bar. But as always in hotels the prices are ridiculous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a Coke, 6.5 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a Heineken are just a couple of examples. There was also a wardrobe with some hangers, a mini safe, a holder for a suitcase and of course a work desk with a couple of chairs. I did try to activate the air-con by the way as I like to have it cool when I sleep but that did not seem to work. Maybe it is only in operation during the summertime. This made the nights a bit warm for me as the duvet was quite thick. I could have opened a window of course but note that there is a church nearby where the bell tolls like every half hour even throughout the night so if you a sensitive to sounds, be aware. The bathroom seemed pretty small to start with but it was not bad at all. It was tiled in various colors, there were heating in the floor, the towels were big and fluffy and the shower curtain option was not too bad (but I still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the shower curtain option to start with). There were not that many amenities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only the usual shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion. When it comes to the bathtub/shower\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I wonder how many really take a bath when they stay for a couple of nights at a hotel. I seldom use the bathtub option and in this hotel I would much rather have a better shower option than the bathtub but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just me I guess. I only stayed at Hotel Pulitzer 2 days so it is hard to give them a proper verdict after such a short time. It seems to be a nice modern hotel in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old shell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as it is located in an old refurbished Amsterdam house located right on the edge of a canal. But being here on business I would have loved to have stayed connected by having access to the internet. But access to the net was not complimentary and came at the price of 19\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for 24 hours or 35\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for 48 hours. That is just ridiculous if you ask me. Another thing that is insane is the breakfast prices. A full breakfast cost 29\u00e2\u201a\u00ac!!! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry that I sound stingy but there is only so much a person can eat for breakfast and I doubt that anyone can eat for 29\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. Another thing that surprised me was the price. I think I paid about 200\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per night for the hotel room but that was without breakfast: I think with breakfast it would be about 270\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. So it is actually cheaper to book the room and then buy the breakfast separately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how silly is that? On day two when I came to breakfast the guy at the reception was quite laid back \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so he told me to just grab something to eat and then tell him on the way out what I had eaten to determine the price. So after 10 minutes I walked up to him and told him that I had a banana and some cereal and a glass of juice (which is my regular breakfast) and he was like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is that all? Get out of here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay anything. Again I wonder how many people actually eat a lot at breakfast at hotels like this. A business travel can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stuff himself/herself full of food every morning when traveling. But all is all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would not mind staying here again. The location of the hotel is not bad as you can walk to Dam within 10 minutes, the bed was huge and comfortable and the room was modern and looked great. The staff was very helpful and approached me very fast when I was looking for help. So all the staff ranging from people in the restaurant, the reception staff and porters were all excellent. To round of I would just like to recommend Amsterdam. I went there on vacation a few years back and I enjoyed it. But I had almost forgotten how charming this city is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after this trip I would like to return once again on vacation to re-discover it.

I mainly chose the property for it's location (I used to live in the neighborhood and absolutely love the area). Unfortunately, my recent trip to Amsterdam followed two stays at true five-star hotels. 5 Issues: 1. It's overpriced and they charge you for everything. When you request a \"canal view room,\" be aware that even if it is available and the hotel is not full, they will still charge you for the view and not even consider a courtesy upgrade. 2. The front-desk staff is friendly, but makes a lot of mistakes. They seem to be a little behind on information regarding your reservation (what is the point of calling Starwood to update your credit card info if they aren't going to update the system and you have to do it again with the front desk person?). There was a lot of confusion around what my reservation entailed (breakfast, payment with reward points, people in the room) and I had to correct them about not having breakfast, not paying with reward points, and being the only one in the room. 3. The rooms are in desperate need of renovation. How odd is it to get the same room twice? Well I did, and since staying in it 3 years ago, not a single thing changed. I was surprised to find chipping paint in the bathroom (which is also poorly lit). 4. It's not really all that clean. My first hint that the cleaning staff wasn't up to speed was when they knocked on my door at 11 am and I requested another hour and they rolled their eyes at me. In addition to their attitude, cobwebs and dust were prevalent and the only thing that changed from day to day was a made bed. Turn down service didn't even include a foot mat after my first day and I had to request a room service breakfast menu from reception when they didn't leave one after the first day. 5. It's not really all that luxurious. The bathroom is not grand and fabulous (where's the spacious tub, state of the art shower, flat-screen tv, and comfy chairs that are synonymous with luxury???). The bed is comfy...but that's about it. 3 Positive Aspects: 1. The location. You can hear the bells of Westerkerk and the canal location is exquisite. You are inside the centrum, which is key and you can walk everywhere. 2. The concept. Staying in a canal house is an experience and makes the hotel very unique and Dutch. 3. Some staff members.

If you are not able to climb a few stairs--don't stay here. That's the summary--here are the details: Check in was flawless and, contrary to some previous postings here, the staff was warm and friendly to us (Americans, traveling with a child). We had booked an \"executive\" room, with a rollaway bed for our son. When they saw that my wife walks with a cane, they quickly changed us to a room that had fewer steps so that she would be less challenged by the hotel's layout. They were gracious throughout. On arrival to the room, we were in the attic room of the canal house next to the building in which the lobby is located. We took an elevator to the third floor, and then walked down a hallway which ended in a stairway that went up six steps or down six steps--almost like you had to ascend to the 3.5 floor, or descend to the 2.5 floor. It had a Harry Potter-at-the-train-station feel. The reason for this is that the hotel consists of many townhouses which have been combined into a hotel--no two rooms in the entire hotel are alike, and the reason for the many stairs is that the floor levels in houses that did not originally connect were not at the same level--hence the need to go up or down a few steps while passing from one building to the next. It is rather maze-like, and you do need to be able to go up or down a few steps, possibly several times, in your path between the lobby and your room. It is for this reason that I do not recommend this hotel if you have mobility problems, use a walker or cane or any sort of other assistive device, have difficulty climbing stairs. They probably do have a few rooms exactly on elevator levels, but I personally wouldn't count on it in this hotel--avoid disappointment and book elsewhere. The room itself was great. No closet, but a big freestanding wardrobe in an alcove. Safe was in the wardrobe. Refrigerator with minibar stuff in it. Cable TV. Bed was great. Rollaway was comfortable, but it was tight moving about the room when the rollaway bed was unfolded. Given that we were in the executive room, I venture to guess that it would be VERY tight in a standard room if a rollaway bed were in use--but there are so many rooms in the hotel, I may be wrong in this assumption. Air conditioning was effective and cooled the room nicely. Room was spotless. Bathroom was nice, decorated with Dutch tiles, very pretty. The highest water pressure I've ever had in a hotel shower, and plenty of hot water too. The breakfast buffet, as mentioned by a previous poster, was outstanding and delicious. It is VERY expensive, but was included in our room rate--I believe the price would have been something like 81 Euros total for 2 adults and 1 10-year-child. That's some serious cash! If you have a way to get it included in your room rate, I recommend that you do so. The Prinsengracht (that's the canal that the hotel is located on) neighborhood is very safe to walk around at any hour, there is a tram stop about 2 minute's walk down the Prinsengracht, there is a big grocery store (Albert Hein) 3 minute's walk, the Anne Frank House is less than 5 minute's walk away (on the Prinsengracht as well), and the Hop-On Hop-Off Boat tour stop is on Prinsengracht too, about 3 minutes walk away. There are a ton of good restaurants in the neighborhood including the famous Pancake Bakery (about 5 minutes walk further down Prinsengracht beyond the Anne Frank House), and a nice little restaurant serving great Dutch food about 30 seconds walk from the front door of the Pulitzer--it's called \"Bij Ons\" (pronounced Bee-YAWNS). Highly recommended. Amsterdam public transportation is outstanding--I highly recommend that you do NOT rent a car--parking is impossible, gas is a fortune, and between the trams and buses, you can get anywhere. You can buy a \"strippenkarte\" (a multi-ride transport pass) at the Albert Hein grocery store, as well as pre-made sandwiches, pre-cut-up apples, oranges, carrots, and all the supplies you might want for a picnic or to take on a train ride if you take a day trip. Speaking of day trips, the tram on the corner can take you directly to the central station in about 10 minutes, where you can then board a train to practically anywhere in the country, or to the airport. If you have only a little luggage, you could take the train from the airport to the central station, and then take the tram to within half a block of the hotel. We took the Connexxion bus from the airport directly to the Pulitzer--you buy the ticket at the airport and it's a LOT cheaper than a taxi; it's an 8-passenger van with possibly a stop or two before your hotel. Americans may recognize the concept if I say \"Blue Van/ Super Shuttle\" All-in-all, except for the stairs which might make moving around the hotel to be physically challenging, I can't think of anything about this hotel that I can criticize, or that might cause me not to recommend this hotel.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel Pulitzer\u201d", "Author": "Beaverhousen", "ReviewID": "UR16796705", "Content": "We checked into the Pulitzer early in the day and I do agree with a previous post that the front line staff come off a little brisk and irritated ( with Americans...I don't know but I did not feel welcomed).

That being said, I have to say that the Prinsengracht location, the unique canal house feel to the place and the other staff made this such a wonderful stay. The a/c was a little warm-ish but that was because we had a large canal room with a really high ceiling and it we had a few hot days. Coming from Frankfurt though, this was still a big improvement. The weather cooled a little towards the end of our week and it was perfect. A friend had dropped off season tkts to the museums and the front desk lost them.

Good stuff The location is the best in Amsterdam, away from the noise and sometimes seedy side of Amsterdam. The hotel is situated on a quiet picture postcard canal and our room (282d) had lovely views of the canal on the 'back entrance' and the houses with big tall windows and was light and sunny - worth staying here for location alone - only the Dylan would compare if you want quiet and upmarket residential area. Staff were friendly and most were helpful Great restaurants and bars nearby - would recommend the Koh i Noor indian around the corner - book in advance as it is small and well used by locals.

Room very clean and housekeeping did provide turndown service etc Lots of hot water, marble bathroom good shower & tub and plenty of toiletries refreshed daily. Towels soft and plentiful Did the hotel boat trip - went for 11am sunday which was quiet and wonderful and much better than the big tour water buses - worth the extra Food at b/fast was excellent although it did get very busy Bar was excellent although pricey, service very good. Free internet access and printing in the business centre - ideal for online check in conceirge helpful Disappointing Whilst we had a good stay the hotel did not live up to 5 star expectations. The room was very small by luxury standards and the bathroom very very small - also it just did not seem like a 5 star hotel - great location but lacking in finess and service. The room was dated and showing signs of wear and tear - and this was very true of the whole hotel - lots of scuffed walls and dated carpets and the reception needs remodelling - we did ask to change rooms to something larger and more 'luxurious' but were told that ours was one of the best executive rooms - and we were shocked! As the hotel was full then no upgrades were available Due to the lack of soundproofing noise travels and we had noisy neighbours next door and above us which impacted on sleep. Our trip was a special occasion and we had booked champagne and flowers - neither of which were there on arrival and had to be chased - eventually delivered the next day - and the champagne was only a half bottle which was very mean - however the booking option does not say a full bottle but for the difference in price I had assumed it would be! Due to the hotel being full, which it seems to be every weekend, and offers on for cheaper b/fasts before 9am then the best time seems to be about 9.45 am - peak time is 11am, and b/fast is served until 1pm on the weekends. Food was very good and plentiful (with freshly squeezed OJ) but the service struggled to keep up on saturday and sunday morning - monday was much better for service as a whole and I guess that during the week is much better and quietier. However they do have great coffee and lots of choices on the buffet. Overall a reasonable stay, not 5 star (perhaps somewhere between 4-4.5) but the location and the bed/linens would mean that we would re visit - but would book well in advance to get the best rate - if you wait the rate only goes up! We left it too late and paid too much for what we got.

I was really hesitant in booking since the reviews online were very mixed but since I was using points and the room was free I wanted to make my own judgement. They listed things like the hotel being not nice to customers booking with starwood points, mold in the bathroom, rooms being small, no drawer space, noisy on the canal side, hearing people walk above them, mice, food poisioning etc. I have to say with all honesty that I am a very picky person when it comes to the hotels I stay in and expect alot whether I am using points or paying for the room. I did not find one of these things listed to be accurate. We arrived at 7:15am from America after being on a flight all night with little sleep. The hotel gave us a room until our room would be ready after 3pm. They didn't have to do that - as a matter of fact most hotels would have just offered to hold the luggage. I found every person from the front hotel desk to the concierge nothing but nice. They treated us like they couldn't do enough for us. We were using starwood points. Having a bad back I requested a room all on one level without stairs near the elevator. We were upgrated to an executive room facing the canal. The room was beautiful. They called after we went up to make sure we liked it and to ask if there was anything they could do for us. They knew it was my Birthday and even left me a present which was a very nice touch. There are also 2 bottles of complementary water in the room. There wasn't much drawer space but I felt there was plenty and I bring everything but the kitchen sink. The bathroom had heated floors, the shower pressure was great and the water really hot. Plenty of towels and amenities were left daily and replaced. They came in every night to turn down the beds, left us chocolate and a cookie and turned the radio on very low. The beds were super comfortable. They even left a note with pillow choices. I hated to leave the room. I looked for all the dirt people talked about in their reviews but didn't find any - I also didn't see any mice. I have also posted pictures so you can see the room - it was room 704. The conceirge made all our dinner reservations which were excellet. Two of the places we went were The Dylan and Moeders all in walking distance. This area is the Jordan district. Its very safe and quiet at night. We took a day trip to Brugge - they printed all the train schedules out for us and brought them to the room. The converter I had didn't seem to be working so I made a request to borrow one - they had it up to me in less than 5 minutes! I travel alot and can be very critical when it comes to judging places - the service here was excellent. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't speak for the food, but we found a great place for breakfast right around the corner. There is also a great bar at the other corner. We spend a considerable amount of time there. This hotel is about 6 blocks from Dam square so its convenient to everything. The tram is 1/2 block away but since its a very pretty town we walked most of the time even though we had bought a train pass. I highly recommend the private canal tour the hotel offers. It was worth every penny of the 38 euro they charged per person. Our guide was so pleasant and knowledgeable I am so glad we decided to do this. We also went to the Ice cold bar, Anne Frank House, Dam Square, Red Light District, Flower market, Rijksmuseum, Alpert and Waterlooplein Markets and many other places all within walking distance or a short tram ride. I will tell you though that you must be careful of bikes, there are more of them than cars so be mindful when crossing the street. This was my second time to Amsterdam.

First of all, the Pulitzer Hotel has a great location. Its \"front door\" and its \"rear door\" are each on beautiful canals. The hotel is a collection of 25 old and well maintained 17th century , ~ 5 story townhouses that are intricately connected (a maze). Elevators are there but we had an upgraded, canal view \"executive\" room (top floor with cathedral ceiling) that needed 15 attic type stairs to access! The room was a good size with marble bath and tv, but to be picky, the two single beds were lousy. Transportation (Trams 13 and 17) and a \"Connection\" bus are a half block away. Tour (\"Key Tour\") buses are a brisk 10 minute walk away. Nearby sights include the Anne Frank house and a canal boat stop for cruising and hop-on/off cruising options. The fact that our 5 night stay was essentially free (on award points) certainly made a big difference - I wouldn't/can't pay 369 euros per night for a late March, 2008, 5-night vacation!!!

We have had many a happy stay, but I have seen a gradual deterioration in the standards over the past 9 years. I understand that over a period of 9 years I can not expect the accommodation to not show wear and tear, however that would be acceptable if the efforts on general house keeping where maintained. Our first room was a lovely room with a canal view, unfortunately the only opening window opened onto a blank wall, due to a storm we then changed room as water was coming through the window. During our first night we never received our turndown service and started the following day with damp towels. Our second room was larger but did not look like it had been used for a little while, the surfaces were dusty, and the toilet had a mould stain from lack of cleaning. There was only 1 dressing gown which was old and torn. Its such a shame that this once 5star hotel is now really only of a standard of a 3star. I hope that the Luxury Collection will be addressing this hotel as a matter of urgency, and polish their service to when we first visited. Beware this hotel is now overpriced dirty and not giving a 5star service. There are many 4 star hotels in central Amsterdam that would offer you better value for money and we will be trying new hotels on our next visit. 9 years and at least 3 visits per year will cost this hotel and I am sure others will be doing the same.

One thing I do not normally do is take Hotel tours but the Hotel has it's own boat for a nightly canal tour with on board coctails and the Captian narrates the trip.

Beautiful hotel on the outside. They have combined about 25 historic old buildings together to form a sprawling hotel with courtyards and gardens at the center. I am a Starwood Platinum member and checked in assuming I would be given my upgrade to the \"best available room\" (this wording according to policies by Starwood). I had reserved a Deluxe room. They said they were upgrading me to an \"Executive Room\" because of my status. The room didnt appear to be any different than the room i had booked. Because these are old historic buildings, they are typically small rooms. I understand that, but when Starwood says you will be upgraded to the \"best available room\" and the hotel is not full, and it has junior suites available that are much bigger, and you have been given a small interior room with no real view, you begin to wonder. I stayed one night because I was jet lagged. But i called the duty manager the next night and asked for a larger room. At first he fed me some story about small rooms. I insisted and was about to call Starwood in the US (that usually works, by the way) and he said he would give me the junior suite. The manager acted like he was doing me a favor. But the back of my platinum card actually spells out the policies. They tried to just give me an upgrade to the next class of room, not the best class. BEWARE - if you are entitled to it and you dont make progress with the local manager, call Starwood Preferred Guest in the US. Other things to note: PROS: 2 free stroopfwaffles each day; GREAT BEDS! (some of the most comfortable i have slept in); good assortment of toiletries; plenty of electrical outlets (pet peeve when they dont have enough); helpful concierge; fashionable and good restaurant; GREAT location for walking to everything; BEAUTIFUL views on that canal, said to be one of the best in the city. CONS (in addition to feedback shown above): expensive wi-fi service (19 euros for 24 hours); mold/mildew in the shower areas (in both rooms i saw); repeated requests for extra towels went ignored; not very helpful valet. Other things to know: the large revolving front door is locked after midnight at some point - you need to press the green lighted button on the bellstand which then rings the night manager inside to let you in; the cafe off the main lobby is expensive for coffee - plenty of local nice places on the \"9 Streets\" which are literally on the next block down; concierge desk has plenty of umbrellas at their desk if you need to borrow one; lighting inside the rooms seemed a bit sparse if you like it bright; you cannot put anything in most of the room refrigerators because they are the automated mini bars where if you take anythign out it bills you -- the junior suite had a small regular refrigerator though; they have plenty of papers to choose from; some bathrooms seemed to have heated marble floors - nice on a cold morning.", "Date": "January 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "The_Chancellor", "ReviewID": "UR12463450", "Content": "Stayed here for a few nights in January.

This room would be ideal for a family, but not with very small children as the stairs were fairly steep. We didn't use this part of the room, but it made the rest of the room nice and airy with exposed beams in the ceiling.

This turned out to be very entertaining as the Gay Pride parade was about to start with a flotilla of decorated barges passing the window. We took lunch at the hotel as we were tired from travelling and found the service to be very poor for this standard of hotel. After being ignored for ten minutes and seeing the waiting staff attend to people who arrived after us, I had to raise the point with the manager. The food was good but the service level never rose above average. This and previous experiences show that there are far better places to eat only a short distance away. For a treat, the french restaurant Christophe will delight people who love food. This was recommended by the concierge and did not disappoint. For breakfast there are numerous small cafes where you can sit outside and watch the city awake, much better than the hotel provides. The room was spacious (room 217 - request it early!) and the decoration and fittings were of excellent quality, with a good bathroom. Other rooms I have stayed in here have not been so big, but have still had a quality feel. As a base this hotel is ideal, and we will certainly use it again. Avoid eating in the hotel or taking expensive hotel organised trips. Walk everywhere or use the excellent tram network to get the most out of your stay. The cycling part of our holiday was outstanding and we used the highly rated barge 'Elodie' (Google it) which gave us a fabulous flavour of the dutch countryside and towns.

The friendly, helpful, reception staff recommended walking routes and nearby locations and cafes. We returned from our walk at 11 AM and our room was ready for us with everything we had requested. Our room was very big, well-appointed and comfortable, with large french windows that opened onto the canal. The location of the hotel could not be better - around the corner from Ann Frank House and a tram stop that will take you directly to the art museums, the train station, or anywhere else. You can request a coffee and tea maker to be brought to your room at no charge. The hotel provides coffee and an assortments of teas, which we highly enjoyed. The hotel had two concierges on duty at different shifts while we were there - one was a bit distant and cold. The other was fabulous. We had many , many questions and he was consistently very helpful and friendly. As other reviewers have noted, the street/canal sounds through the hotel windows can be a bit noisy, especially on the weekend nights. However, the noises of small motor boats going down the canal and pedestrians talking outside our windows didn't bother us. We slept very well. If you want quiet, consider not staying in central Amsterdam. Some friends stayed in nearby Haarlem and took the 15-minute train ride into Amsterdam each day to see the sights and enjoyed that. We liked staying in Central Amsterdam and the Pulitzer is in the Jordaan, a lovely walking area very convenient to many of the sites. We rented bikes from nearby Bike City (recommended by the friendly concierge) and enjoyed bicycling around Amsterdam and out along the Amstel River to a nearby village of OuderKerk., about 4 km outside Amsterdam. We passed old-timey windmills and lovely flower gardens. Then we rode back along the opposite side of the Amstel, and, after returning our bikes, enjoyed a good meal at a cafe across from the Westerkerk, just around the corner from the Pulitzer., ready to fall into our comfortable bed.

Also the area is amazing. Around you will find the 'nine streets' which are famous for the small designer shops with great Amsterdam treats. I stongly recommend 'Dutchies' - a local leather handbag designer a few streets from the hotel - once you have a custom made bag from here you will never buy LV or Gucci again.

It was our 25th Wedding Anniversary and we had a very nice room overlooking the canal. The room was very clean and we were provided with robes, slippers etc which all contributed to our comfort.On our first evening the duty manager telephoned to ask if everything was to our satisfaction, which it was. After long days of sightseeing the room was a liittle oasis of comfort to return to. The hotel is a series of old canal houses joined together so obviously it does not have some of the features of a newly built hotel. However this all adds to it's charm and the public areas and passageways adjoining the restaurant,bar etc are all bright and airy. During our 3 days spent there staff were constantly cleaning and hoovering these areas. I was astounded by a previous reviewers criticism of the breakfast service. We can only say it was first class and relaxed. Lambert, who seemed to be the senior waiter, could not have been more helpful and always found time for a little chat with us no matter how busy he was. We were always seated immediately upon arrival , as were all other guests whom we encountered.The choiceand quality of food was first class.An example being freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals,breads etc. Smoked salmon, various types of cold meat and cheeses. Hot breakfast consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, mushrooms etc. We found everyone from the porters, check-in staff, conscierge, cleaners etc to be efficient and friendly.

We were so excited as my partner had stayed there before just after it was renovated and was impressed. We could not recommend this hotel to anyone in its current state and it desperately needs to be renovated, cleaned and extra staff hired. 1) Check in was prompt but the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smile or welcome us 2) The room at first seemed cozy but there was a layer of dust on all the furniture like it had not been cleaned 3) We requested a quiet room but we got the noisiest next to the main entrance and a window next to the entrance was above the bed 4) One bottle of water supplied between two people so for the price it was a bit mean for two people to share one bottle 5) We went to the bar for the last drink the first impression was that it was dirty so we had no choice but to sit at a dirty table, then the waiter came to wipe the table and wiped the dirt on top of us. We ordered wine and it was terrible (like the bottle was opened for a month) Then the waiter was really pushy with the bill but we wanted to order another drink. 6) On the way back to our room the receptionist was carrying blankets and duvets in the public lift even though there is a service lift (lifts only hold about 2 people) 7) The worst of all was the breakfast; it was filthy like a garbage bin. There are notices up to go to breakfast between 7am-11am (as far as I remember the times) as it gets extremely busy after these times. So we went down at 10. I was shocked. There was 2 staff in the entire restaurant so there was a 0 star service. Again, the tables were filthy and the waiter wiped it on top of us (previous dirt was in the grooves on the table already and smelled terrible). There was nothing on the table and it took 30 minutes for someone to come and ask us did we want something to drink no chance for us to grab any one to order morning coffee! The coffee was like tar. There were no glasses to get orange juice then when they finally came direct from the dishwasher a couple of people burned their hands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c OJ, hands and hot glasses don't mix well. Next came the cereal which I had to eat with my teaspoon. There was just no staff to ask. At one point another man got up and went to the chef's kitchen to ask for some cutlery and something to eat off. 8) We ordered a taxi from the hotel to go to a restaurant and the taxi man left us waiting in the reception for 30 minutes and it wasn't even busy 9) The cleaners were sitting around in the hallways with vacuum cleaners lying in harms way. 10) When our room was made up the bed looked like someone else had slept in it and watched TV for a while and all our belongings were moved around 11) Check out was peaceful they didn't ask us how our stay was and we didn't bother to comment we knew we were not going to stay there again 12) Out with a bang - we collected our carry on luggage from the Concierge and asked him to book us a taxi to the airport - we saw this hugh luggage trolley in the reception with our 2 tiny bags sitting in the middle of reception unattended. He asked us to wait in the reception. There was a glass table and I have never seen something so filthy in my life. There were crumbs on the table and everywhere around the table.

It was small, and with all the furnishings was crowded (to reach one side of the bed I had to climb over a sitting chair). The bed was queen-sized and adequately comfortable, but a little firm and lumpy - not what I would expect given the focus high-end hotels are placing on their beds these days. The pillows, however, were great. There was also a small desk, a large closet, a regular TV (not flat-screem), and a Bose Wave radio/CD player. Lighting was adequate, but not great - with all the lights on the room was still a little dark. The bathroom was also small but very nice. The tub was large and accomodated me easily for a bath (I'm 5'11\"), but it was narrow, as seems the norm in Europe. Each day I was left a complimentary water bottle and cookies, and turn-down service was accompanied by some chocolates. My room looked out over an inner courtyard of sorts, but all I could really see was other parts of the hotel. Since I was on the 2nd floor of a 4-5 story building this meant very little natural light. The front desk staff were very understanding when I asked to be moved, but they could only put me in a different room for the 2nd night (I declined). One of the best things about the hotel is its location: in the heart of Amsterdam, but just far enough away that it's quiet and feels more residential. There are many nearby restaurants and shops, the Anne Frank house is a 5-10 minute walk, and the tram is only 3-5 minutes away. Overall, I was happy with my stay in Pulitzer, but not thrilled.

The excellent Amsterdam tram service also goes right past end of street. Getting there: Train from Schiphol to Centraal (3.6 Euro) taxi to Hotel (10 Euro) Alternative: Connexxion Airport/Hotel Shuttle bus 12 Euro single. Centrally located this Hotel is ideal for business or Tourist. The other choices (Hilton etc) are not so centrally located. The neighborhood is great, very old world Amsterdam, with shops and cafe's adjacent. Safety: Good. Avoid the overpriced Hotel breakfast, turn left out the Hotel door, and go half a block to tiny Cafe Hoek on the next corner. Owner speaks great English and serves an international breakfast and outrageous coffee. Noticed a few Hotel guests there. Warning: Locals all smoke in here. What to do: Take a 10 min tram ride from Dam Sqr to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum. Old Masters in their authentic setting. What a feast. The Anne Frank House on next block 2 mins away. A must if you have never been. Window shopping down the Damrak essential. Canal boat ride from Centraal or Leidsplein. 1 x hour 10 Euro. (Goes directly past the Pulitzer Hotel) Centraal Station currently undergoing major renovation....so a little harder to negotiate at this time. Hotel Property: Needs some updating, corridors and stairway areas worn and faded. Small lobby, small gym, expensive restaurant. Wifi in rooms and lobby. (Relatively) Good value at 5 Euro per hr or 19 Euro for 24 hours. The not so good: Check In: Handled by trainee. This property is meant to be 5 star. It's not. It's a somewhat unusual property in that it's very old world, occupying 25 canalside homes. This in itself makes for a wonderfully authentic Amsterdam experience, albeit at the 4 star level. It's an uncomfortable bedfellow, the expectation of a modern 5 star rating standard in a 16th century property that retains much of the original architectural features. The Room: Upgraded to an exec king, two level canal front room, with two more beds in the attic area. Unfortunately the smell of smoke pervaded my entire floor (4th) although in my Frequent Stay Starwood profile, a non smoking experience is required. There were also ashtrays in my room. Being tired after a long flight, I demurred and stayed put. Bathroom: Small Overal comfort: 7/10 Elevators: Yes x 3 - Older and small. Stairs: Oh Yes. Restaurants: Did not use Concierge: Competent.

Also, simple requests are never followed through and this includes my wake up call which didn't happen and asking for an iron which never arrived. The rooms are also hit and miss, the first time I stayed I was in a great room with a canal view and the second one was tiny and looked on to a white washed wall. For nearly 300Euro you do feel a bit cheated with the whole experience. I really can't see how it gets away with claiming to be in any way a 'luxury hotel.

This past time we were traveling with older relatives, and they were more than willing to accomodate their inability to deal with stairs, and gave them a room right near the elevators and recognizing that we were return guests, gave them a wonderful canal-view room... certainly made their trip a little more romantic.

It is well located just a few steps from a tramline, a short walk to central areas, and some of our favorite restaurants. All the times that we have been there, we have yet to try the in-house restaurant. We do, however, love the cookies that you get in your room upon check-in.

There have always been the two of us visiting and we've always asked for a double room. So it's been quite surprising to find that we were once offered a split-level room with two twin-beds \"upstairs\"; we've had a suite which was a good size but rather strangely had a sink and electric hob in the hallyway of the room (can't see many people who can afford to stay there cooking up an economy breakfast - but there you go - especially when little amuses bouches are brought round mid afternoon); the garret room had literally no space (one shelf in the wardrobe) and was very dark; the room on the ground floor had wonderful exposed brick work and a newly decorated bathroom with a heated floor. That worked very well. So a lot of it is, unfortunately, down to luck of the draw. I would recommend this hotel strongly though. The staff are almost all helpful and polite (not used the concierge but did notice the golden keys on his jacket), and the breakfasts are very good. Not eaten there in the evening, but the bar does very good cocktails in convivial surroundings and has a fine cognac selection too. The hotel's location is roughly central - and if it seems that 10 minute extra walk from Dam square is a bit far in the evening - you'll welcome the peace and quiet when you arrive back. There's definitely a good \"feel\" about the hotel. The hotel seemed to go through an economy drive during 2005 (removing things like the complimentary slippers and the welcome cookies, and not refilling the breakfast containers... Cold dregs of scrambled egg anyone?), but someone seems to have come back and got things back in order. No longer will the traveller have to experience this. The hotel's not cheap - but that's fairly typical for Amsterdam - and I agree its grip on a 5* rating is up for questions (it's a fine 4* hotel though) - but (like Amsterdam itself), I think everyone should experience it for themselves and not necessarily rely on what others have told them.

We stayed in the Pulitzer for 3 nights and our experience was not good. When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that despite being SPG platinum members we would not receive an upgrade, fair enough. We were checked into a room but when we walked there we found out that there was already a guest staying in that room! Since we were not looking for additional room mates we went back to the lobby, we were allocated another room, when we reached this room we found out that the AC was not working. We were asked to stay in this room and wait for the engineering department to fix the AC. We politely declined saying that we prefered to be checked into a room with a functioning AC. We were then allocated a third room which was not exactly impressive but it was ok. Just past midnight when me and my wife were about to go to sleep a big rat was running across our floor. I was so upset, surprised you name it.... However when I called the reception they did not seem surprised at all so I guess this is normal for this hotel. In my book it is not normal for a hotel where prices starts at 300USD to have rats in the rooms!! We were therefore moved to yet another room half past midnight, this the duty manager insisted was an upgrade (which was not available a few hours earlier). However the \"upgrade\" was to a room without any ventilation what so ever where the air had been standing still for a very long time. Me and my wife instantly came to think of the air in the catacombs under the st peters cathedral in Rome. Anyhow we were now so tired of moving rooms and my wife is in the 7th month of her pregnancy so we did not want to walk around this hotel any more. However one staff of the hotel said herself about the air in this room(474) \"this is emberassing\" and indeed it was, then she told us \"good luck\" and left :). The next morning I called up the hotel manager and complained about our first day at the hotel and he was very appologetic and was the only person that I talked to during my stay who made any sense. He offered us complimentary breakfast and tickets for two museums. The first morning we had roomservice and before leaving our room we called room service for clearence. When we returned more than 6 hours later our trays had still not been collected and the left overs from our breakfast was now smelling really bad (this was during the July heat wave). Next morning we went down for the breakfast buffet, there was only one person seating guests during the busiest time of breakfast and a long line was building up. We were seated in the garden where probably 40-50 people were sitting. In the entire garden there was one! waiter who served coffe and cleared dishes etc. We were offered tea or coffe after 30 minutes into our breakfast and piles of dirty dishes were building up since the poor guy had no chance to clear them all by himself. Since nothing had worked out during our stay I called one day before our departure to check that the front desk were indeed aware of that our breakfast would be complimentary and this was confirmed. The next morning when we checked out the front desk was completely unaware of this and insisted that the breakfast was chargable and it took some discussion for these charges to be reversed. In general the hotel staff seems unwilling to help or to take initiative and I also think that the staff are not properly trained. This hotel has a very very long way to go before it will be worth the money that it charges. I can not believe paying 300USD a night and we were not comfortable to return to our room at the end of the day and on top of that the service is very poor.

Having just returned from a five day stay with my wife and 2 year old son, I must say my personal experience was very positive. The hotel is quite tastefully decorated, feeling definitely upscale without going over the top as it happens in so many \"luxury\" hotels. The Pulitzer's particular arrangement (several 18th century buildings internally linked) makes you feel you're staying at a small hotel, altough it has more than 200 rooms. Warned by some of the reviews here, I asked for a room facing the inner courtyard when I got there. It was a good choice. Absolute quiet, indispensable for my son's naps (and we stayed in a room with wooden floors, and heard absolutely nothing from neighbors - we stayed in the 4th floor, though, and maybe that's why). Rooms are indeed small by the standards of other 5* hotels, but hey, that's part of the package of staying in renovated 18th century houses. Charm comes with that price. In any case, our room had an extra bed for my son and still felt spacious enough. And the location is just absolutely perfect. 10 minutes walking from the Dam, 10 minutes walking from the shops in Leidensplan, 15 minutes walking from the Rijksmuseum, and plenty of very nice shops and restaurants in the streets crossing the canals. Without being located at exactly where the busiest places are, it was equidistant from all of them, and thus quieter and still convenient. Breakfast was excellent, the staff always courteous and helpful. And the concierge, well, it depends: we talked to at least four different people behind the desk. Some were very helpful, some slightly less so, but the difference was in degree and not in kind. Overall, no complaints here. The canl trip with Pulitzer's boat was very nice, although the skipper's/guide's dry sense of humour may not be to everybody's tastes. It was to mine. The only problems were: - the bed was not King size, unlike advertised. Just two smaller beds put together, with a slightly annoying gap in the middle. Still confortable, but could be better; - after the first three days, the turndown service ceased to exist. What happened? I wasn't bothered enough to complain, though.

The ceiling and upper walls showed obvious traces of damp along the tapes of the plasterboard,even a puddle shaped seepage onto the top of a pelmet over a (very) small window.Obviously the roof is leaking above this gable and the AC is blasting tainted air into the room. At Reception the Night-Duty Manager(female) whose name I have noted, appeared to resent being interrupted whilst in conversation with a friend, her expression when I told her what we thought was the cause; practically a sneer of disbelief.Her solution? To spray the room! This was not acceptable for health reasons.At no point did she seem interested,I could feel my \"professional\" face about to develop. Because I did not wish to spoil my daughter's first visit, I did not pursue the matter as vociferously as I would normally, or when with my husband.

We had secured four free nights at this hotel with our Starwood Preferred Guest Program. I would gladly have paid the stated rate for this hotel given the service we received. The hotel is located on one of the nicest canals in Amsterdam, in several dozen canal houses that have been refurbished and converted into the hotel. Everyone from the front desk workers to housekeeping staff to the bellhops were very welcoming and attentive. We arrived around 3 p.m. and were originally assigned a king bedded smoking room with a canal view. As we had requested a nonsmoking room, we went back down to the front desk and requested that we be given a nonsmoking room. None was available at that time, but one was in the process of being cleaned and would be ready in 30 minutes. Only caveat was that it would not be a canal view, but a garden view instead. We decided to go for that room anyway because the smoking issue is crucial for us due to health reasons. While we waited, we decided to have lunch at the hotel's restaurant, Pulitzer's. The restaurant has a lovely outdoor eating area under umbrellas. While we were having lunch, the front desk agent that had checked us in came by with the new keys and even comped our drinks with lunch. I thought that was a very nice touch and exceeded my expectations of customer service. The new room was perfect. In retrospect, we were very pleased that we ended up with a garden view room instead of a canal view room because it was so quiet in our room. We did not hear a single noise during the four days that we were there. The room was very nicely decorated, with hardwood floors, a comfortable sitting area and a nice-sized bathroom with a shower curtain(!). We received a complimentary bottle of Evian Water and two yummy carameled waffles every day, replenished without request. The housekeeping staff was wonderful and very attentive to any requests. Turndown service was a nice touch. The only part of the hotel that we felt could use some improving is the concierge. Every individual we encountered at the concierge desk did not provide us with any more information that we had already gleaned from our travel guides. If anything, they were extremely pushy about trying to get us to take one of the hotel's planned tours rather than providing us with the information to allow us to do what we had requested. There are several restaurants in the area that are worth noting. Walking toward Westkerk from the hotel, you will come across a small Spanish Tapas restuarant called El Rincon Andaluz. It will be on your right as you walk on Prinsengracht toward the church from the hotel, before you reach the church. It had wonderful food and excellent service. A bit further down Prinsengracht from the Anne Frank Huis is a great little restaurant called Spanier and Van Twist with most of its tables being outdoors along the canal. We had lunch there twice during our stay and it was very good and extremely relaxing and enjoyable to eat outdoors under the trees and watching the boats sail by. Try the quiche- it was excellent. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel if you are seeking a true luxury experience during your time in Amsterdam.", "Date": "September 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Pulitzer\u201d", "Author": "vivvy", "ReviewID": "UR3837942", "Content": "Just returned from a wonderful stay at this superb hotel.

My experiences were quite different from some that I read! First, contrary to some reviews, the room I had (executive) was quite large by European standards. I requested a quiet room and got room 199 which overlooked the courtyard. It was very quiet indeed. Because of my request, the room selected was carpeted which also helped rather than having a room with wood floors. But really not that much character. The concierge, contrary to reviews here, was not very helpful. Sure they get the same questions all day, but she always seemed to give the quickest answer she could and in every case was no better than if I had tried it without her. The boat tour, also highlighted here, was poor. The captain spoke very poor English and really wouldn't say much. I stood next to him to get any information, and he just wouldn't say a thing! It's a nice and quaint boat, but I would recommend using a commercial line. It was also expensive at 33 Euros each. So almost $80 (couple) for a non-descriptive 90 minute tour. Buy yourself one of the self powered boats and do it yourself! The location is certainly good, but so are many others. Breakfast came with the room which was good because I certainly wouldn't have spent 50 Euros each for it! They also nickel and dime you for a lot. Pick up a USA Today (even as a Starwood Gold member) and its 2 Euros on your bill. Use the internet in the business center - 8 Euros for 15 minutes!

I chose a garrden room, only because I wanted quiet, and I did not know how much noise there might be near the canal. The queen size bed I had was split right down the middle with two separate duvet white comforters on top of the queen bed, so that two people could each have their own blanket for their own \"side.\" It was somewhat annoying, as the blanket for your side is small. But the room is very clean, and very up to date. BOSE speakers next to your bed, nice lighting, and hardwood floors. There is turndown service, great bathrobes, slippers, chocolate by your bedside. The bathroom is also clean and sophisticated, but small. The marble floor is heated! There is a mini-bar with motion sensors, so don't take anything out if you don't want to be charged. The concierge of the hotel is hit or miss. Some of the staff is very courteous, others are somewhat stuck up. They did recommend buying a ticket in advance to Van gogh Museum, and I was able to buy it there. Great advice, because the museum is mobbed with ticket buyers.

We arrived at 9:30am thinking we'd have to wait to check in but the room was ready-so our early check in phone request also paid off. The room was lovely-not huge but just right. Brick walls, big arched window looking onto the canal. Staff was great, room was great and the location is perfect. As far as it being part of the \"luxury collection\"- It is not the St. Regis and this is an old property with uniqueness, character and a total european feel.

Although the hotel itself was very nice, there were a few problems. First, I made the booking by phone which turned out to be a big mistake since I didn't have written proof of what the agent had told me. She said that breakfast was included in our plan, so the first morning we ate there. The breakfast was delicious, but certainly not worth 25 Euros which we were charged. When I tried to explain to the staff that we were told that breakfast was included, everyone told me that I must have misunderstood - no one would even acknowledge the possibility that the Sheraton booking agent actually made a mistake. The second, and more serious, problem was that there was a huge concert taking place on a makeshift stage set up just in front of the hotel. This blocked off the street, forcing our taxi to drop us off a block away. That was no big problem, but on Saturday, the day of the concert, the hotel was mobbed with people attending the concert. Throngs of unsupervised children ran at will through the bar, preventing us from having a quiet drink and conversation. When I complained about this noise, the person at the desk said, \"certainly you were told about this concert and the disruptions it would cause when you booked.\" Once again, I had not been told. We were able to hear part of the concert from an upstairs hallway window - tickets were impossible to obtain - even for hotel guests. I would stay here again - the location is hard to beat - but I would not even consider staying during that concert weekend.", "Date": "March 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston, ma", "Title": "\u201cjust perfect\u201d", "Author": "whistler2005", "ReviewID": "UR3302871", "Content": "this hotel is truely the best in amsterdam and an enjoyable place to stay.

The room itself was well appointed and luxurious in a discrete sense- exposed brickword, glossy floorboards and heavy curtains. The size of the room we were first appointed to(standard, facing other buildings) would bring about claustrophobia in anyone who felt they needed space on the floor to both put their bags down and move around...needless to say, we asked for a 'tour of the available rooms' and were obliged- and relocated to a room with a canal view that was slightly larger, although we were shown other much larger rooms, these were down a tunnel of corridors which necessitated going past the restaurant (and then some more). There were some pleasant touches- there is an alarm clock with a cd player, chocolates and other pleasantries left beside the bed, a bath which expels water from three different sources and so forth. Location- a 5-10 minute walk from the following: A large shopping centre and market place, tram stops, the grand krasnapolsky, dam square, Anne Frank's house. Further afield by tram you can find the Van Gough. There is plenty to do- we enjoyed our trip to the zoo, which was very easy to rech by a tram stop close to the hotel. The concierge helped us with this- they always proved themself to be courteous and informative. The brakfast room was gorgeous-they had some lovely breads. Ignore the idiot who complained in a previous review about the orange juice machine making a noise- you will find several freshly squeezed juices already prepared by the attentive staff and I can't say I heard anything worth mentioning! Now, in terms of value for money- we paid \u00c2\u00a3168 per night (per room, including breakfast) and were hoping for something rather special. Perhaps our expectations were too high, but we didn't feel, on reflection that the hotel merited such an amount when other perfectly good hotels were available for half the price. If you feel quite comfotable parting with around \u00c2\u00a36 for a gin and tonic from the in-room then cheers and enjoy but I tend to opt for more ecomical options ( you can always knock yourself out a bottle or two of 3 euro '98 spanish red from the local equivalent of a rather diverse primark as we did) We had a really fantastic time, but I can't say I would return to the hotel again, as for all its character it was essentially just a slightly above average hotel in a nice location.
