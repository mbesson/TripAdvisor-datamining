The first time we stayed here was 4 years ago, and at that time, our stay went smoothly. However, we just finished a 4 night stay at the Branson La Quinta, and this stay did not go smoothly, at all! First, we argued with the staff about which room we were to stay in. We had made reservations with family, and we wanted to stay in rooms that weren't too far apart. Even though there were available rooms together, we were told that because we had made our reservations with Travelocity, we would be staying in the cheapest rooms they had. I was appalled that the lady at the desk had said this to me! Our room was clean, but the beds were very hard, and the sheets wouldn't stay on the bed. Also, there were no blankets or quilts on the bed, which made it awfully cold to sleep. The breakfast was poorly planned out. There are only a handful of tables, which were always full, and only one highchair. We had to take our breakfast outside, and sit on the curb with our children. The \"hot\" items, like the sausage, biscuits and gravy were lukewarm at best. The doughnuts were almost always gone. The worst part about this hotel, is that they stole from me. My wallet was stolen out of our room, and when the staff at the front desk was told of the problem, they seemed mad at us! We filled out an incident report, but were told that no wallets had been turned in by housekeeping. This got me to wondering, why would housekeeping turn in a wallet, or any other item found in a person's room? Aren't they only supposed to clean the room, not go through the contents of it??? I did fill out a police report, and now all I can do is to hope that the culprit's conscience gets the best of them. I will NOT stay at this hotel again!!

As if maybe someone worked on a car engine and smeared it all over the shower walls. But that black print was embedded and not washable. You can be bring your pets. I find this to be a good thing.

The other hotel/motels I called had either a no-pet policy (which is fine) or a 35-pound limit or a 1-pet limit. Either you accept pets are you don't; I get so frustrated with the limitations. Anyways, La Quinta told me no problem and I did not have to pay a pet deposit either. They were very accommodating. Upon checkin, they even let us use a couple of extra blanets to put on the hard wood floor in our room to make it more comfortable for our big babies. We also had a 40' trailer we had with us and they let us disconnect the trailer and keep in parked in the back of their parking lot so we didn't have to haul the trailer with us everywhere we went.

Check-in was supposed to be at 3pm, but we appreciate that they gave us an available room, even though we arrived 2 hours early. We had originally booked a single queen bed room at the lowest rate, but they were nice to upgrade us (which I did not know until we got to the room) without extra charge, to a 2 queen bed room facing the pool. We also bought 2 tickets from La Quinta for the 3pm show at the Legends when we checked in. Ms Katrina at the front desk was very attentive, and asked if we would be using the pool and gave us extra towels before we head to the room. Our room 3306 was on the 3rd floor, adjoining the Music City Center building, next to Heroes Coffee (which I believe was the old Starbucks). As soon as we were inside the enclosed pool area, we felt very warm from the heated pool, even though it was relatively cold outside. When we opened the door to our room, the d\u00e9cor was just as pictured on their website \u2013 blue wall paint and 2 queen beds. The flooring in our room was carpeted instead of wood from the reviews that I have read, but that was fine by us \u2013 no funky smell that we could tell. Our room also has a small fridge, coffee maker, iron & ironing board, and plenty of clean towels. We did use the heated pool, but only briefly, because it was quite dirty (lots of hair all inside the pool). There is also a small gym room by the pool area with a couple of treadmills. TV has decent number of channels, but just a note (not a negative to us), if you come across some channels that are hazy, such as HBOs, it is because this establishment does not subscribe to HBO channels. Breakfast was from 7-10am, which was already starting to get crowded around 8am. Breakfast was adequate for us, with cereals & milk, yogurt, toast, biscuits & gravy (we did not see any sausage), hard boiled eggs, waffles, bagels, juice, coffee, and whole apples. The motel is across from Legends in Concert, and just few steps from Dixie Stampede. Nearby restaurants within walking distance are: Fuddruckers, Subway, and Apple Bee.

The night before we left, I went down to the office and asked to pay my bill so we could leave right away in the morning. I was given a total and there was a balance due of $53.57 and I had her put it on my credit card. I also used a gift card and each time they ran it through it would get declined. Well I called the card company while I was in the lobby and they said La Quinta was \"adding a 20% charge\" to the amount I authorized which made it go over the balance on the card. Then the next morning I went to the office and the General Manager, Kirk Paige, told us we owed quite a bit more. I told him that I'd been at the office the night before and both of the agents gave me the balance due and I'd paid it. He said they were wrong and was extremely rude, condescending and told me I wanted to argue and accused me of not wanting to pay my bill. I told him I was going to write a review about the problem on Tripadvisor to make other travelers aware of the problem I had and he said \"Well I hope you tell the truth\" which I really took offense to. I looked at my bill on the drive home and found out that we'd requested a refrigerator which NEVER SHOWED UP, but the charge for it sure showed up on my bill.

However, if someone is not traveling with a pet, and/or dogs and their noises are bothersome, this probably is not the best choice of lodging. There are dogs EVERYWHERE! You can't hear next door too much, but you can definately hear the room above you. And if there's a dog barking a lot, you'll probably hear that too. But, bonuses for people traveling with their dogs: I have yet to see the management enforce the \"under 50 lbs.\" rule (there were 2 Great Danes staying 3 doors down from us), and I think having hard floors in a hotel that allows pets is a great idea! They definately stay cleaner! Plus they have nice little grassy areas for your pets to relieve themselves, and they provide poo bags and trash cans in those areas (so please use them!).

Their continental adds hard boiled eggs, waffles and cereals (hot and cold) to the usual pastry, coffee and orange juice fare and goes from 6am to 10am. Add to that about a dozen or so tables so not half the people are eating their waffles standing up. The staff are all fluent in English - um - something native to this area.

We go to Branson almost every year and since joining LaQuinta rewards program we try to stay in them whenever we can. This was our first time in this particular LaQuinta and it will be our last. I booked online and was not informed the room was next to the pool. We are in our 50's and tend to go to bed a little earlier than some but still we expect things to quieten down by 10-11 pm. They did not, the pool remained full and very loud until almost midnight. Our neighbors on one side were so loud that a little after midnight we had to call the desk and complain of them banging on the walls and making much noise. At least that did do some good. The walls are so thin that every time someone flushed the toilet next door it sounded like it was right next to your head. On the other side somebody had apparently left their dogs unattended in their room and they barked until after 1 am. The AC unit was loud. There was no comforter on the bed. The bathroom walls were bubbled and caulking was coming loose and the toilet plugged up the first time it was flushed. Not to mention a very uncomfortable bed. Our plan was to stay 2 nights. Instead we got up at 5:30 am, showered and left. We will stay at LaQuinta again but it won't be this one. We went down the strip to the Hampton and finished our stay.

When I made the reservation, I was quoted $66 per night, but when I was checking out they were going to charge me over $100 per night. The man working got a bit annoyed because I kept insisting on the price I was quoted. Finally, after asking for a manager, he was able to find a rate of $63 per night and we settled on that. All in all, it was a fine hotel for the price. Im sure you could find a nicer hotel, but you will also have to pay alot more for it!", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cThe good, the bad and the ugly\u201d", "Author": "OK_traveler999", "ReviewID": "UR14174435", "Content": "Stayed at La Quinta for one night in a 2 queen bed room with 2 adults and 2 kids. The GOOD: Easy checkin/checkout, very clean room, excellent bedding, central location. The room had hardwood floors, extremely soft bedding, and nice furniture.

The BAD: loud heating unit, small room, small vanity area was exposed to rest of room with no door, and tiny shower/toilet room too small to change clothes in. Not good for mixed company.

We hardly leave the premisis because there's so much to do at the hotel. They have free continental breakfast, they have a starbucks coffee shop, live show, a beautiful pool area, and more! Everyone is very friendly and helpful. Isn't that what you want when you stay somewhere? It's always wondeful when you can get away with the one you love and feel like you have no responsibilities.

However, we had some issues with the front desk. I booked 3 rooms. The hotel ignored my request to put our party together although rooms near me sat empty. The real trouble showed when we got our credit card bills. All rooms were originally booked on my credit card, and the others in my party gave the hotel their own cards with then arrived. We all checked out at different times, yet all of us had billing issues: I had a total of five charges on my credit card in a single day, another member of my party got charged twice, the third not at all \u2013 although they were under the impression they paid before they left.

We've never been to Branson before either. Check-in was fairly quick and the room was clean and big enough since we were only there 2 nights. We had a poolside room and I would recommend this if you have kids who want to use the pool. The pool was great for us because the shallow end was only 2 feet deep. Having small kids it allowed us to let the kids go in the pool alone (with us sitting at the side). The deep end went to 8 feet I think. The pool area was nice with a pretty fountain and a hot tub. The hot tub was a perfect temperature for me. The breakfast was ok--a few cold cereals, bagels, toast, donuts, waffles, milk, juice and coffee. Considering it was free, I suppose it was pretty good. There was always someone refilling empty containers and there was always an empty table even though the hotel was full. The first night we saw the Haygoods show which was connected to the hotel. The show was excellent and the location couldn't be beat. We actually went back to our room for intermission. We ate dinner at the Rib Crib next door so we didn't have to deal with any traffic that first day.
