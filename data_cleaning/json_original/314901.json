I would just say that visitors to this hotel (or any other hotel anywhere, but especially in Vancouver where bed bugs are kind of a problem) should check their rooms very carefully. They do have mattress covers, a staff trained to clean for bed bugs, very concerned management, and apparently no history of bed bugs. However, even hotels with perfect track records can have the occasional bed bug incident. I found a few bites on my body after the first night and noticed some dark streaks on the otherwise pristine bed skirts (could be a sign of bed bugs). So, I'd say that Times Square probably does more to prevent bed bugs than most hotels, but each traveler should take precautions (e.g., leave luggage on a table or in the bathtub, use the suites' dryer to apply heat to all belongings before leaving). Just google bed bug to see how to prevent the spread of these critters, and bring a bed bug repellent spray with you to every hotel you visit.

Everything was clean and in good repair which made it much more agreeable than is often the case. The only reason I gave the sleep quality rating of 4 instead of 5 is because of there being a super firm mattress in the main bedroom; I like firm, but this was a little harder than was comfortable for me. Really enjoyed having the nice LG flat screen TV with a DVD player and a decent sound system for radio or CD's. Complimentary WiFi was a nice perk, and we appreciated that there was a phone number to call 24 hours a day to resolve connectivity issues (FYI - Skype video calls show as suspicious upload/downloads and can get your log in temporarily banned). They also have a secure parking garage off the alley that is well lit, with large stalls to fit most all vehicles easily. You do pay extra for parking, but it's worth it for the convenience as street parking is metered and heavily enforced. One doesn't need a car, but there are so many \"must see\" sights in the area, you will benefit by having transport. Location is also highly desirable if you prefer the streets to be a little bit quieter than the main shopping / business district. While being just a few blocks away from center, you will find coffee shops, grocery stores, bistros, cafes, and numerous other comforts outside your door; with a lot less noise! Plus, you are located 2 blocks from the entrance to Stanley Park; one of the most beautiful parks that also includes a wonderful aquarium, restaurants, gardens, and lovely walking, biking, driving routes. The hotel does rent bikes, helmets, etc. too. Last but not least, the staff were all very pleasant, helpful, and accommodating!

I spent a week at TSS in late June while attending a conference at the convention center - it's just over a mile away and walkable in 20 minutes. It really is like staying in an apartment - much more apt-like than a hotel room or even a hotel suite. Modern, exceptionally clean and comfortable. I had a car and there's space for maybe 25 or so vehicles in the garage - you pay for it but based on the deal I got on their website ($150) it was worth it. I found the TSS to be very quiet, in terms of hearing other guests. I was on the 3rd floor and rarely heard anything from neighbors above or adjacent. The one and only drawback - and I would direct this especialy to anyone who is sensitive to noise - was my suite faced Denman Street which is a very busy neighborhood street. Vehicle noise is pronounced and very loud even with windows and balcony door shut, particularly on weekends and during rush hour. It did not, however, bother my sleep as there was a nice window A/C unit that drowned it out and I had no problems sleeping. The tip to get a quiet suite would be to either face the alley or Robson - that end of Robson where the TSS faces is residential so those would be quieter than Denman. Overall that was a minor drawback in the scheme of things, but if and when I return I would definitely make the request to not face Denman. It is so nice to be that close to Stanley Park and several bike shops next door to rent a bike to pedal around the park or town in - highly recommended if you have a chance. There's a Starbucks, convenience store, flower shop and several restaurants on the ground floor of the TSS, and Safeway is directly across the street. A block or two walk will take you to all the restaurants and coffee shops you could ever want, and all ethnic cuisines represented. Capers is another market (a small Whole Foods) for organic choices 2 blocks away. You can also catch busses all over town on Denman or Robson, or easily walk to downtown or the waterfront.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Ever\u201d", "Author": "Jarkko65", "ReviewID": "UR114970338", "Content": "I put this shortly: This is place to be if you ever visit Vancouver.

We also used the washer and dryer - VERY handy for two travellers just off a cross Canada train. They supply a complimentary small box of detergent (enough for one load) and 2 fabric softener sheets. You can purchase additional detergent and fabric softener at the Front Desk (who were most helpful about everything). I LOVED the bed - defintely the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept on. They also supply 2 nice thick bath robes. There was also a nice gas fireplace. Also the staff were just great - very friendly and exceptionally helpful. If you arrive early, they are only too happy to keep your bags secure while you do some sightseeing, The same thing when you leave. (They kept our bags after we checked out until our friends arrived to pick us up.) The location was perfect for us - close to Stanley Park and transit and near lots of restaurants. Only 3 VERY small negatives. It's nice that coffee is supplied but it is really awful Nabob stuff. We tried it once and it was pretty bad - so we just bought our own. Also it would be nice if shampoo was supplied(bath soap is supplied) and the water pressure in the shower was kind of weak. However none of these really impacted our stay in any significant negative way.

We took advantage of the washer/dryer set in our unit to wash my son's clothes (he's a student at UBC). The kitchen had a full stove, a dishwasher a microwave and a full fridge. We bought some groceries nearby and made breakfast in our room. This suite had two smallish TV's but I don't stay in hotel's to watch TV so it wasn't a big deal. For us the best thing about this hotel was the location. At street level (on Denman St) there is a Starbuck's and a very nice little Italian Restaurant. There is a large Safeway store across the street and a nice gourmet/ organic market called Caper's about a block away and a small neighborhood store with fresh produce right beside the front door. The entrance to Stanley Park is a block away and there are bike rental shops across the street. The Beach at English Bay is also a couple of blocks away. There were many, many nice little street side cafes, serving every kind of ethnic and local food imaginable in the blocks around this hotel. When we checked in we buzzed the office from the front door and then we were directed around the back to the parking garage (we had a rental car) were the front desk is located. This building has three floors and many apartments are not part of the hotel (as I understand). It was very quiet in this hotel. It was an additional $12/day for parking in the underground parkade. When we checked in we were told that we could use the gym and pool facilities at a Fitness Center that was a block or two down Denman street for free. I didn't know this ahead of time and I hadn't brought my bathing suit. This hotel had free wi-fi but we didn't have much luck with it when we were trying to use it. It was very intermittent and frustrating to try to use. I don't know if this is how it always is. Eventually we went downstairs to the Starbuck's and used their free wi-fi which was working well. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. We have stayed at the Loden and the Fairmont Pacific Rim previously when we have visited Vancouver. I enjoyed both of those hotels but I think that when we travel as a family it is nice to have more space to spread out and it is great to have separate bedrooms and the ability to have some meals in your room.

The gentleman manning the fort when we arrived was Rick and he was happy and able to give us almost all the information we needed to know for our stay; indeed, one of the things that struck us about Vancouver was how friendly & helpful most people seemed to be. Bus links are excellent, with lots running up and down Georgia (Highway 99) to & from the City Centre (#19 to the Waterfront being useful); and the number 5 (which turns into the 6 at the bottom of Denman Street at Beach Ave) providing a 'round the block' service into town. Bus tickets are excellent value and $2.50 will take you almost anywhere. We found it particularly convenient having Safeways supermarket immediately opposite, because one could nip out before breakfast to get fresh rolls etc for lunch (Canadian & US made-up sandwiches not being to our taste!). The accommodation itself was fine and the only real annoyance - which is nothing to do with the management - is the fact that the traffic lights are constantly 'chirping' (alternating in fact between something akin to a 'cuckoo' and more of a croaking sound) to indicate to the dozens of visually impaired people who might wish to cross over the road during the course of a year that it might be safe to do so (but not it seems before 7am weekdays and 9am weekends when they're switched off because these people obviously don't help other than during working hours) .

We were here for a wedding and decided to stay a few extra days since we were travelling so far (from Nova Scotia). I wanted something that allowed us the feeling of home (living room, kitchen, etc) since anything over a couple nights and it's just what I need. This place is awesome! The staff are great, from my first contact for reservations to our penultimate day were there for us. They arranged cabs and helped us with dinner suggestions and even helped print flight boarding passes. The suites are awesome - very romantic. We opted for the studio with den since it was just us 2 and we were not disappointed. It was great and had everything we needed. Although we never used the fireplace (beginning of Oct) it was so nice to know it was there and how nice it would be in colder weather. The location - perfect. The only downfall for us was the wedding and dinner the night before was by the airport so the cabbing was expensive but our counterparts that stayed close to the airport paid similar to come downtown and to surrounding areas, so it all works out. We were close to more restaurants and markets, coffee shops than anyone would need. We often had a hard time picking what to do as there were so many choices. Cleanliness - the suite was perfectly maintained. We chose to not have any services while there trying to be environmentally conscious. This is one of the only places I've stayed in that actually means it when they say it is an option. If you don't have a \"make up room\" card out then you don't get your room made up/changed. There are extra towels under bathroom sink if you need them. BONUS - they give you 2 free pouches coffee, tea and enough detergent and softener for laundry initial use. The dishwasher detergent is enough for several washes. The extra fees for more than supplied is more than fair. Overall they think of everything you may need initially. Rates - I think the price is very good for what you get and the location. The only thing I would want differently is a small dresser in the studio units. They have made use of almost every square inch but a wee on that had rollers that fit in the closets would do nicely. For me I used the 'reading room' and its bookcase for that.

The bedroom had a comfortable queen size bed with a duvet and lovely soft pillows. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, as well as televisions in both the bedroom and living room. Our teenager slept very well on the pull-out sofa bed. The amenities are excellent - there was a washer & dryer tucked away in a closet next to the bathroom, which was very convenient, as well as a full-size fridge, stove and even a dishwasher. There is a roof-top patio, which we used on just one occasion to barbecue our dinner instead of going out. The housekeeping was excellent, and the hotel provides lots of towels, which also makes a pleasant change from a regular hotel. There are dozens of restaurants right on the doorstep - we had no problems deciding where to eat. There are bus stops close by on both Robson and Denman, which will take you downtown, as well as to the ferry to Granville Island, etc. The hotel even gives you a free pass to the nearby fitness centre (including a pool) on Denman St. There was an air conditioner in the bedroom, and all the windows open if you prefer the fresh Vancouver air. We found that it helped to close the windows to deaden noises from the street - this was mainly an issue on the weekend due to some latenight partyers in the street behind the building. Request a room at the back of the hotel if traffic sounds bother you - the staff managed to accommodate this request. The underground parking was secure and very reasonably priced. I really can't say enough about our positive experience at this hotel. I used to live in Vancouver, on the next street over, so I know the area very well, and I can honestly say that if you want to get a real \"Vancouver experience\" - i.e., access to fantastic Stanley Park, bike rentals, beautiful beaches, sunsets at English Bay (with coffee in hand from one of the numerous coffee shops on Denman), then this is the area to stay in.

There are many varied restaurants and all of the ones we visited were prepared to to do meals for take-out and there is a liquor store almost opposite the apartments so it's easy to have a special meal in the apartment whenever you want. We travelled by Sky Train from the airport and opted to walk from there to the apartments, which is a 25-30 minute walk, although we could easily have taken a local bus to West Georgia at Denman. The move from one apartment to the other was quite painless for us - our suitcases and the fridge contents were transferred for us by the staff after we left the apartments for the day.

The only minor niggle was the air conditioning - it was really hot weather during our stay and there was only an actual air conditioning unit in the main bedroom which was noisy, and fans in the living area and second bedroom.

However, back to the good points - the location was great! We like the relaxed atmosphere of the neighbourhood and felt really at home and safe. Definitely a good area to stay for families. The building itself is quite secure, as you need your key to use the lift. There were any number of shops right on the doorstep, including Safeways where we bought drinks, lovely fruit and breakfast supplies, and Capers market which has everything for a gorgeous picnic.

It is located on the corner of Robson and Denman in Vancouver's trendy west end and is literally a 5 minute walk to both coal harbour and the magnificent Stanley Park. In my opinion, if you are visiting Vancouver, it is the perfect location... just far enought away from the tourist hotspots to help you feel as if you are living like a local but close enough should you need/want to explore the attractions the city has to offer. The hotel itself... and I use that term loosely was terrific. Our 1 bedroom suite was spacious, spotlessly clean and indeed a little better than we had even imagined. The air conditioning was excellent and the fully functioning kitchen made life easier. The reason I hesitate to call this place a hotel is that it truely feels more like having your own little city centre flat than being governed by the rules and restrictions often associated with hotel stays. The staff were as accomodating as you needed them to be but all in all just left you to get on with enjoying your stay. In addition, you have a lovely cafe downstairs, a complementary membership to a superb gym located a few blocks away and are on the doorstep to numerous ethnic eateries and as I said before...

All of this should have set off alarm bells but we were so excited to visit Vancouver that we overlooked these HUGE warning signs.

Once arriving in the \"suite\" we discovered the crib we had regested was missing in action. There is no local to call the desk so we had to make the trek back to the parking garage area to have the crib delivered. The delivery took over an hour which seemed like forever with a tired baby. When my wife turned down the blanket she found it crusted with the vomit of another occupant. Another trip to the garage was required. Once this crib situation was sorted we settled in for a noisy night in what seemed to be a suite adjoining a honeymooning couple.

We really enjoyed our stay here, for the following reasons: 1) Great location. We love Japanese food and it was great having fantastic Japanese food at our doorstep (across the street). Besides Japanese, there were great Korean, Asian and other restaurants in every direction. Cafe Bojangles downstairs had very, very good coffee too. We ate in every night for dinner and were spoilt for choice. 2) The room was spacious, large enough for the kids and their toys to sprawl out. Lots of storage space, and we also appreciated having a washing machine and dryer in the room (rather than in a separate laundry room). The housekeeping staff were good and kept the room in excellent condition. Bedding was very good -- not Four Seasons quality, but certainly much better than a lot of generic hotels I've stayed at. 3) Kitchen was well equipped, and we liked having a large fridge and a convenient microwave. 4) I appreciate the free access to Denman Fitness down the street. Lots of machines, and a nice pool too. (Note: it's five minute walk away). 5) The hotel is about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the heart of Robson Street shopping. So it's not too far, and not too near too. And it's a nice walk. Here are the downsides: 1) They didn't have wifi! So I had to sit next to the phone jack with my laptop. This was surprising since wifi is almost ubiquitous, even in small hotel and motel chains. 2) Noise! There was some construction in the building when we were there -- I think one of the shops in the building were being renovated. The construction went on till the evening, and one night, past 11 pm! I called the hotel manager to make a complaint, and he said that \"they know better than to go on so late\". The next evening the noise stopped earlier. 3) The staff - as has been noted - were a little bit terse. They didn't go out of their way to help, but they weren't unfriendly or unhelpful either. So I would be neutral about them. The office was very, very small - my wife and kids had to stand outside with our luggage while I filled in the forms. It should be redone to make it more welcoming and inviting.

I stayed in Sandman Suites and Sunset Inn, both near Davie and Burrard as well as Times Square, each for a night to get the general feel of the place. Times Square beat the other two hands down. (Sandman, too much of a hotel feel, Sunset, a bit of a dive). I have stayed in two further rooms at Times Square over the month long stay (while looking for a house to rent) so feel qualified to give my opinion. Most hotels in Canada offer a monthly rate if you stay over 30 days as they don't have to pay the tax. This can drop the price considerably (to around 50% of the normal rate) if you are staying that long. Times Square offers a very homely feel and the rooms are better designed. The furniture is what you would expect in your house, not a hotel, the kitchen is well equipped with a dishwasher (free powder) and a washing machine and drier (buy your own powder) tucked away in the cupboard in the Canadian style. The kitchen also has lots of the little things that you need at \"home\" like sharp knives, colander, potato peeler, that kind of thing, all clean and working perfectly. Someone has obviously put a lot of thought into what you might need. Cleanliness: Always clean, everywhere. On shorter stays cleaning is daily I think, on longer stays (month) it is twice a week but to be honest there have only been a couple of days in the month where it wasn't cleaned so I think they come in pretty much everyday. All the common areas are clean and the housekeeping staff friendly. Security: Key only access from the street into a small foyer with same key used to call the lift for double protection. Key access to your room with a deadbolt and strong viewing chain - not that you'll need either. Location: Robson and Denman is a not glitzy, it's more residential - it is at the start of main residential area near Stanley Park. You can feel comfortable walking late at night on your own. There is a small shop below (give the guy a break, he has just bought it and is really working hard at making sure that it is a success, stop by and tell him what you want to see in the shop!) there are plenty of sandwhich shops and coffee shops within a block and turnonto Georgia and you can see Coal Harbour and Stanley Park, two of the most attractive areas of Vancouver. Traffic Noise: The rooms on Denman which are close to the junction have lots of traffic noise especially in the twilight hours - can disturb sleep - these are rooms 211-214 (and respective floors above (311, etc). I stayed 1 night on the Robson side (on a previous visit) and that was OK. I also stayed a week at the rear of the hotel which was near silent! Finding the hotel when you arrive: This is difficult but it is better to park round the back where there are spaces, then when you have your parking access you can just drive the car in. Alleyway West of Denman, North of Robson behind the Times Square hotel. Times Square written on white garage door. Soundproofing: Some noise can be heard from people walking about upstairs and some non-intrusive toilet flushing but otherwise that is it, nothing from either side. No conversational noise, no hallway noise, very quiet indeed. Dishwasher is fairly noisy but I never heard my neighbours'. Travelling with an infant?: The \"den\" is ideal for a cot, the hotel will remove the small bed in there if you want. Not sure a fully grown adult would want to stay in the den as a bedroom, a bit small. Internet Access: Is available on a pay per day with around a $40 cap for longer stays so good value. Fast and reliable hard wired to a standard ethernet socket using a cable which is available from the desk (or use your own). Parking: Again is a cost but cheaper than anywhere else. Secure underground parkade with remote entry and access straight up to the hotel. In 30 days at full occupancy in the hotel apparently, I always found a space. Bathroom and Shower: Clean and tidy with plenty of power to the shower! Things they could do better: I had a couple of terribly minor points with one staff member not knowing what the other was doing with my reservation but you can get that anywhere and it wasn't really an inconvenience. It's also a bit warm in the rooms but nothing a flick of the airconditioner or opening a window can't fix. That's about it to be honest.

It was passable, but there were too many little annoyances to make our money spent worthwhile. For instance, the alleyway leading into the parking lot is creepy and dirty. You need to drive by dumpsters to access it. The room keys do not easily fit into the doorlocks so you're stuck standing out in the hallway jiggling the door so that the key fits. There is no central a/c in the rooms. On our final day, we asked about checkout procedures and were told to just leave our keys in the room.

We stayed here Aug. 1-3 prior to taking a cruise and thought everything was terrific! Our suite, situated toward the rear, was very clean and quiet. We had a one bedroom plus den without a balcony, and it was very nice for 3 adults. My husband and I had the bedroom, where the bed was a queen-size as we had been told. My mom, 88, had her choice of either the convertible sofa in the living room or the single bed in the den. She opted for the den and loved it, although the \"den\" isn't all that much larger than twice the size of the bed. Windows all around kept her from feel hemmed in and having her own space gave her privacy. The den would also be great for a child. We had no problem with the airconditioning. We put a verticle oscillating fan in the bedroom doorway and the whole place stayed comfortable. We loved being able to make our own breakfast every morning (yea for Safeway) and the dishwasher was a pleasant surprise. We had take-out pizza one night up on the roof garden - a wonderful place complete with a gas grill and picnic supplies for those who want to something other than take-out. For other meals, the area just bristles with interesting restaurants. We found the location to be very convenient to most everything we wanted to see. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. We were emailed prior to our arrival warning us that we were arriving on a \"fireworks\" night and that the area would be crowded. This turned out to be true - what a mass of humanity - but we slowly made our way to the Times Square to a warm welcome. Even had our name on the room listing outside. When we left, our bags were put in the luggage room until we needed them, at which time the staff made sure that our cab picked us up at the back (garage) entrance - even running around the building to make sure that the cab found us in a timely manner. We could not have asked for any better service.

My husband booked a large two bedroom at the Times Square based on reviews from TripAdvisor and the hotel website. Our 3 children were travelling with us. I had my first doubts about the hotel selection when I reviewed their confirmation letter which stated that full payment is made upon arrival - not check-out. The room we received did not have a king size bed as we requested and was rather small for a family of 5. Upon entering the room all the portable fans were turned on and circulating a very stale ,unfresh air. The web-site is VERY!!! misleading with respect to room size and it does not mention that the building lacks central air. During the summer months it is very hot in the evening. On our first night no one was able to sleep and the pillows smelled awful - I had to wrap them with bath towels. When we expressed our concerns and told the front desk (a small office on the 3rd floor) that we wanted to check out - the clerk said fine, but you will still be responsible for the full stay . We asked to speak to the building owner/manager - Irene Roy - but were told that she would be in the next day and would call us first thing in the morning. At this point, we felt frustrated and trapped and were not willing to loose $1000.00. The owner never called us and I later learned that she lives at Times Square. Our view was the back of the building facing several dumpsters and an alley. Each morning my daughters and I had the pleasure of being awaken by the garbage trucks and a view of transients searching through the garbage bins. I could go on and on , just don't rely on the web-site and save your families from having to sleep in rooms that make you wonder if that's mould your smelling.

We were in a one bedroom suite and it was absolutely perfect for the two of us. Just enough room to have space, but not too big. We loved having the kitchen in that it enabled us to save a few dollars each day by making our own breakfast. We also loved the fact that we had our own washer/dryer in the unit. That was a huge lifesaver because it allowed us to bring half the clothes we needed to. The hotel couldn't be better located - in my eyes. We were literally at the corner of Robson and Denman - which are two great streets to be on. I know in some of the other posts, it mentioned that certain units had a lot of street noise, but we really didn't find that to be true and we were facing Denman - near Robson. I was concerned about it (after reading the posts), but even with our windows opened, the only thing we heard from the street was the beeping of the street lights occasionally - and even that wasn't bad or distracting. And I really don't believe having a higher floor would alleviate that. We were on the second floor, and I don't think being on the fourth floor would have mattered much. We did utilize the parking and while we had to pay $12/night, I believe that was probably comprable to other hotels. The only real issue I had was the Air Conditioning and that wasn't too big of a deal. There is only one AC unit in the hotel unit and it's in the bedroom and the first night - even with it on - I was quite hot. And it wasn't even that hot outside. The next night, we tried having the AC on full blast and shutting the bedroom door part way and that helped. By the third night, we shut the door the full way, and it was better. What was weird was that during the day (with the AC going in the bedroom), it was downright cold, but at night, it just didn't get as cold in the bedroom. They had extra humidity controls in the hotel unit, but we weren't sure how to use them, so we left them alone. They also had plenty of fans in the hotel unit, so we fully utilized them. The maids were great and the unit was spotless each day. Check-in and check-out was easy. Just had to check-in before you parked your car in the garage and check-out after you left the garage. All in all a beautiful hotel that was so close to Robson/Denman, Stanley Park and the waterfront. My husband and I walked everywhere - even to Gastown/Chinatown from our location.

When we checked in, we realized not only were we given a room on the back side of the building, but we were also given a studio with a den for the price of a studio, which was nice. At check in, the reception was quick and friendly. I asked about a good Indian restraunt, and the gentleman recommended India Bistro, which was FABULOUS! Yummy food. He gave me a map, showed me where it was and also pointed out a few other landmarks. The building was very clean and felt very secure, as you had to use a key to get into the front door, and a key to open the elevator. We paid for parking, which is a must, as there is no street parking anywhere around. The parking garage was very secure and there's another keyed entry to the foyer with the elevator. Our room was immaculately clean and was much bigger than we had expected! It had a sleeper sofa, a fireplace, a dining table with four chairs, a tv/dvd combo, microwave, fridge, dishes, dishwasher, coffee pot w/coffee and condiments, electric teapot, iron/board and a full size washer and dryer! There was tons of closet space as well!! We felt like we had our own little flat in Vancouver, it was great! Plus, there was lots of room for our little one to spread out with her toys and gear. There was a nice little den/sunroom off of the living room that had chairs. We also had a powerful AC, which was handy, as it was a pretty warm weekend. The bed was very comfortable and had really nice sheets and a fluffy duvet. We never heard a sound from anyone else around us, or from outside the entire time we were there. It was very quiet and pleasant. The location is amazing! It is walking distance to Stanley Park and all of the great things you can do there, plus there are coffee shops, grocery stores and restraunts all around you within a couple of blocks. Also, as a last note.....they were doing some repairs to the windows on the back side of the building. There was a note on the table in the room informing us of this upon check in. They apologized for any noise or inconvenience ahead of time. However, we didn't hear anything or feel inconvenienced at all. We didn't even notice they were working on anything, really. But, when we got home, we had an email with 20% off for our next stay for the 'inconvenience'! It was very thoughtful and generous, we thought! We will definitely be staying here again!

We prefer the location of those hotels; however, we also liked at the Times Square Suites having a living room, a full kitchen, and a bedroom. Our king bed was comfortable and the apartment was very well maintained. It rained one entire day of our stay. It was nice to go home in the afternoon and read in front of the fireplace. (Which are out of service May-September according to a note in the room.) This would be an ideal place to stay with children. It is a short walk from the sea wall. There is a Safeway across the street and nearby many restaurants, ranging from pizza joints to fine dining (Raincity Grill, etc.). There is no ice machine. We purchased ice from the Safeway for $2.99. I found the operation to be professional. I booked the room over the telephone and received a confirmation by e-mail.

The suites are impecably clean and very homey with a full kitchen for those who enjoy eating at home a bit throughout a longer stay. I have stayed up to three weeks at this property and have always looked forward to my return. The new beds are a dream with the white duvet covers and tons of pillows. The building is situated on Robson and Denman and on the outskirts of the world famous Stanley Park....the hussle and bussle is an added feature to our stay in Vancouver. I found the suites very comfortable and experienced no difficulty at all adjusting to my new lively and active surroundings. I wouldn't stay anywhere else. This area is famous for its shopping, resturants and close proximity to almost everything including English Bay (where the fireworks display is held in late July and August), Stanley Park, The Vancouver Aquarium, Robston Street (everyone knows that street) The Vancouver Art Gallery and so much more. The building is secure, but not impersonal like the larger hotels around. The Building Manager runs the property like it's her very own, taking care to the details that customers notice.

They initially had no record of our reservation, but conveniently found it after searching at length through folders for the piece of paper that contained our reservation....for a whopping $189 per night do they not have a computerized reservation system?? Although we had requested a King Bed, they had no record of this either! Our \"QUIET\" room, faced out to Denman Street (a booming traffic district, oozing with homeless degenerates). No apologies were made for these grave errors, instead we were made to feel lucky to even get a room. The room was sweltering as our \"air conditioning\" unit, was a window mounted unit located in the bedroom. I could barely breathe, and my asthma was out of control. Although they claim to be a non pet friendly facility, I found several pet hairs on the sofa and chair. YUCK! On our second night, as we were leaving for dinner, I was shooshed in the hallway by the building maintenance supervisor, Irene Roys, as I recieved a very important business call on my cell phone. I found this to be extremely unprofessional especially as she was clad in a robe and bare feet AND they claim to cater to the business clientele. I would never send my business clients to stay in such an establishment. We need to be able to carry out our business when the time calls for it.

There was also a free bus around Stanley Park, but we never used it. The hotel is very secure. As another reviewer has stated, it is a little confusing when you arrive. The exterior door is locked and you have to buzz up to reception to let you in and to send the elevator to you. There is no big fancy lobby, only a small office on the second floor. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite on arrival. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. We found the room was overly air conditioned on arrival, so we turned the air conditioner lower. Our room faced the alley, so our view wasn't great. We were there for such a short time that this didn't bother us. We never had any problems with noise. The kitchen and laundry facilities within the room are wonderful to have when travelling with children.

The hotel is well-located and is within walking distance of Stanley Park and shopping on Robson street.

I originally went with this hotel because of the location, the kitchenette and the decent price. As well, the great reviews it has received was a definite plus. However, I was a little disappointed. The location is good, but I learned that getting around Vancouver by car is so easy that we really didn't need the premium location. As well, there were so many great looking restaurants that we never even used the kitchenette. Finally, the room was not as comfortable as I expected. Even though it was supposed to be on the quiet side of the building, we were frequently woken up by garbage trucks picking up dumpsters in the back alley. The furnishings were also stained and tired looking and the room was so hot at night that we didn't sleep well. I don't fault with the hotel staff for these facts, but I would suggest that you'd find better value in another hotel with more creature comforts.

Of the three hotels we stayed in during our trip to BC, this was my husband's favorite. It was number 2 for me for just one reason: it's not really a HOTEL as much as it is a corporate apartment. This turned out to be a positive thing (and the location truly couldn't be better-close to Stanley Park and the main restaurant/shopping part of Robson), but if you want room service, your bed made every day, etc., then this isn't the place for you. However, if you want a clean, safe place to spread out and relax, eat breakfast in, and even do your laundry in your room for free before you go, then it's perfect. Would we stay here again?

My three teenage kids and I stayed in a one bedroom studio at the Times Square during June 2006. What a great place for a family! We had plenty of room in our clean, well-maintained suite, allowing us to enjoy some privacy when needed. The den was more akin to a second bedroom, with its own television and a small balcony. Unlike the typical hotel room, we never felt cramped. The fully-equipped kitchen and washer/dryer came in handy. No need to haul dirty clothes home. The parking garage was convenient and secure. There is an extra charge for parking, but it is well worth it. The comfort of Times Square allowed us to fully appreciate this beautiful city - we returned with fond memories of the Stanley Park Aquarium, Dr. Sun Yat Sen Classical Chinese Garden, Lynn Canyon, shopping in the boutiques on Robson Street, and all the rest. Our suite was directly above the intersection of Robson and Denman. We enjoyed watching the activity below. We could hear some noise from traffic, but by using either the fan or the air conditioner, the sounds were completely masked. We felt completely safe in this location. No problems whatsoever when walking around the neighborhood. You should be aware that the Times Square is not a typical hotel. It is more like a small apartment building. We found the staff friendly and helpful. (We even received a thank-you note after our stay.) However, if you need a lobby, concierge, room service, pool, etc., this is probably not the place for you. Other reviewers have given favorable mention to Bojangles, the cafe on the first floor. In my opinion, Bojangles bests any hotel coffee shop. Great atmosphere, and good food at reasonable prices. Tables are available both indoors and off the sidewalk. The Times Square is within easy walking distance to countless restaurants, as well as a Safeway and Whole Foods-type grocery. There is a small independent grocer on the ground level, too. My kids and I especially appreciated the ice cream (gelato) shops in the area - a delicious reason for an evening stroll. I heartily recommend the Times Square to travelers who want clean, spacious quarters and who are willing to forego a traditional lobby and hotel layout.
