We had such a pleasant experience - travelling with young children can be such a nightmare but thanks to the Omni it was actually enjoyable. From the moment we checked in we had first class service. We were upgraded to a corner King room that was huge, perfect for adding a crib and a rollaway. We had a lovely view of the bay and ample room for the boys to spread out and play. They brought us a refridgerator and the crib and rollaway within 20 minutes of our request. They also gave our boys a backpack with lots of fun stuff. We enjoyed the heated pool and jacuzzi before heading down to McCormick and Schmick's for a happy hour dinner, which was also fantastic. We came back after a fun walk in the Gaslamp District and put the boys in the huge bathtub and headed to bed. The bed was comfy and despite the noise from the trains we got a great nights sleep. One thing that we did note was that the central air system was soooo quiet. My husband loves to have the air on all night and in other hotels it wakes me up everytime it turns on, not at the Omni. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, rather than travelling with kids or for a romantic getaway.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lotster", "ReviewID": "UR127673863", "Content": "Brilliantly located hotel slap bang at the beginning of the heart of the gaslamp area so 2 min walk to loads of restaurants and bars.

The hotel is modern, stylish and has a solid feeling of quality all around. The rooms are standard size, well appointed and have great bathrooms with fabulous showers (no tubs in our standard room type). We were staying with our child, so we opted for the two beds/room option. Unfortunately, the Omni uses doubles rather than queens, so the sleeping arrangements were tight for my wife and I. The comment in the title of this review refers to the horrific location of the Omni immediately next to the railroad tracks. Each train (and there are MANY on a daily basis) sounds its horn repeately as it approaches each intersection (and there are MANY intersections), so be prepared to hear a series of loud horn blasts roughly every 30 minutes in the evening and night hours - apparently sounding the horn is not obligatory during the daytime. The hotel actually provides two free pairs of earplugs in the nightstand drawer, anticipating that you will need them! The concierge said the city is working on making the Gaslamp District a quiet zone for rail traffic, but who knows when that will be enacted (if ever). To be fair, not only the Omni suffers from this noise issue - about 80% of the hotels in the area of the convention center are adjacent to the tracks. So be prepared for a bad nights sleep unless you can ignore a freight train passing within 20 yards of the hotel! The restaurant of the hotel was quite good for both breakfast and dinner, and in our opinions reasonably priced for the quality. The staff was attentive, courteous and helpful. Overall the Omni experience met our expectations, with the only detraction being the proximity to the tracks. I dont think a better option exists in the area, so enjoy the hotel, and utilize your complimentary earplugs!", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in Downtown\u201d", "Author": "dgerson76", "ReviewID": "UR126038918", "Content": "Stayed in a jr suite for a business trip recently.

Upon check in our children were greeted with a kids activity bag with all sorts of fun stuff for them to do. They even delivered chocolate chip cookies and milk to our room that evening.

We ate breakfast at the hotel both mornings and had wonderful meals. We had a view of the bay and were able to watch the Christmas boat light parade from our window.

We stayed for 2 nights in December (over the new year) as part of a week-long California vacation. After much research I settled on the Omni and it met my expectations in almost all areas, though fell a wee bit short in a couple. Pros: \u2022 Great location at the bottom end of the Gaslamp \u2022 Good value (premier double queen) -- The 1st night was only $159 as part of their Say No To Snow promotion (free valet; complimentary margaritas; Macy\u2019s coupon \u2013 which, technically I could have got on my own; bottle of sunscreen was also advertised, which I never got, though didn\u2019t ask for); the 2nd night I paid their $219 internet rate \u2022 First rate service \u2013 check-in staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful; when making my reservations I requested a fridge for the room and it was already set up and plugged in when we arrived; also, I knew about the SNTS promotion, but couldn\u2019t get the rate online since the promotion didn\u2019t apply to new year\u2019s eve which overlapped our stay \u2013 I called the hotel\u2019s front desk directly and the manager was extremely helpful in ensuring the promotional rate applied to my first night \u2022 Two views from our corner room #2033 -- Direct view into Petco stadium and (slightly less nice!) the city/train-yard/part of Coronado bridge; having paid extra for a premier room it would have been nicer to have a water view (which I requested when making my reservations) -- a view of the stadium is cool, but in December when baseball is in the off-season, it's really not much of a bonus \u2022 Decently-sized room that fit: 2 queen beds; a TV armoire (with 5 drawers and, yes, no flat screen but the quality was good and lots of channels); office desk and chair; reading chair \u2022 Bathroom: Very spacious with a good-sized tub/shower; 2 robes; lots of shelf space and towels (including 2 bathmats, nice touch \u2013 who doesn\u2019t hate standing on a soaking wet bathmat?!); good toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, vanity kit, sewing kit\u2014soap but no shower gel); hair dryer \u2022 Other room amenities: Full-length mirror and mirror over the desk (nice touch for natural sunlight when putting on make-up since the bathroom doesn\u2019t have a window); single-pod coffee maker; turndown service; large closet with ample hangers; laptop-sized safe; 2 luggage racks (which I loved, often you only get one) \u2022 Nice little touches \u2013 cookies at the concierge desk, iced water in the lobby, bottled water in the car through the valet service \u2022 Omni guest membership \u2013 free wifi (decent connection); up to two free beverages per guest per day (including freshly squeezed orange juice) \u2013 this was definitely a great perk! \u2022 Nice gym \u2013 The view of the parking garage is nothing to write home about, but the gym itself was very sunny and quite spacious with about 4 elliptical machines, 4-5 running machines, a recumbent bike, weights; nice little touches included free headsets to use with the running machines; a TV; free iced water and fruit; lots of towels \u2022 Outdoor pool \u2013 Since it was December we didn\u2019t use it, but I could see how it would be a great place to spend time in the summer; there was also a hot-tub and several rooms with patios that opened directly onto the pool deck \u2022 Parking: Since valet was included only the first night we did the self-park the second night which was quite reasonable; the covered garage is a 5-second walk across the street and I ended up paying $17 which was likely an inflated price given it was new year\u2019s eve ($12 overnight parking, then an hourly rate starting the next morning \u2013 we were checked out by around 10am) Cons: \u2022 Noise: I requested a quiet room, and for all I know #2033 may have been one of the quieter rooms as it was on a high floor; however, on the first night it was quite noisy from what must have been one of the neighbouring hotels or bars \u2013 sounded like there was an outdoor club with an MC egging the crowd on and cheering \u2013 this didn\u2019t go on all night, but was annoying and somewhat unexpected; also, there indeed are train tracks below, and occasionally I would hear the odd train go by \u2013 being on a high floor it wasn\u2019t unbearable and I was expecting some train noise, but want to highlight this for the light sleepers out there \u2022 While the room overall was great, just a couple of small little touches would have made it better: (1) Lighting \u2013 nice and sunny during the day since we had a corner room, but at night there is no overhead lighting so you are relying basically on table lamps and the room is actually quite dark which made reading difficult, (2) a ceiling fan and more hooks in the bathroom would have been great as there weren\u2019t a lot of options for hanging towels, robes, etc. Would I stay here again? Absolutely! For the level of accommodation and service I feel the Omni offers good value. I don\u2019t feel it quite warrants 5 stars given some of the noise challenges and minor annoyances to the room that could be easily addressed.

The Gaslamp Quarter itself (the old downtown of New Town San Diego) has been reinvented in recent years as a glossy old-worlde restaurant/bar precinct seemingly popular with tourists and locals alike. If you become tired of eating out and crave fresh food, fruit and vegetables etc., there's the Ralphs grocery store a few blocks' walk to the north-west between Market and G Streets which the helpful front desk staff at the Omni directed me to. The immediate neighbourhood seems very neat, clean, orderly and safe (with the usual sensible precautions of course). It may be a tad glossy for travellers who are looking for a grittier urban experience, but heck, that's the Gaslamp! My room was on one of the upper levels and faced south. The view from the compact private balcony was pretty stupendous: the hotel pool directly below, then the rail ines (which I never tired of watching being something of a trainspotter - both the trolleys and 'heavy' freight trains run through here). Then, past the Hilton hotel and dockyard areas, the magnificent San Diego Bay and the Coronado Bridge. The changes in the view as the sun rises and sets are really something to see. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom well-appointed and the decor conservative and tasteful. I didn't notice any significant noise from within the hotel. Although other reviewers have commented on noise from the trains, it just blended into the general ambience for me and I slept well. The Omni struck me as pretty good value (incidentally, I got complimentary morning coffees through joining the loyalty program when booking online). It's certainly not 'budget' accommodation, and is more a business class-type place, but I'd stay there again.

Although the light rail trains do not run all night, freight trains do come through in the middle of the night blowing their horns. Prepare to be awakened.

Not exactly hygienic. Upper floors have nice views over the city or San Diego Bay, Coronado Island, and the Pacific (we were on the 16th floor with these views).

The hotel is located right near a tram stop, so that was convenient if you choose to not rent a car. If you are just staying downtown, there was really no need to rent one b/c everything is within walking distance. All of the staff were very friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond to make you feel welcome. When we first got to our room on the 14th floor, I was kind of shocked to still see the old box style television. Not a big deal, but as a couple who travels a lot we haven't seen these in quite a while. Also, there was no ipod docking station/alarm clock which I have also come to expect. The first night, I was woken up at least 3 times by the tram sounding it's horn about 10 times at the tram stop located right near the hotel.It does this every time it stops! Even 14 floors up, it was loud! A staff member said they were in the process of passing a noise ordinance and told me that the location of my room (front of the building) was actually the best spot as far as blocking the noise. So we didn't even bother switching rooms! The rest of the nights we slept with the fan on, so that definitely helped and I was only woken up one other time from the tram horn. The room overall was clean and basic. Enough room for the bed, small table, and the piece of furniture that held the tv and mini bar. Mini bar prices were insane. You are better off not even taking the key! The bathroom was nice, and roomy but if you are traveling with someone don't expect any privacy. The bathroom door is a sliding door with tinted glass. There is a large gap around when it shuts. You can see right in through the gap from the desk area in the room. Shower pressure wasn't great, but certainly not the worst I've deal with. We tried McCormick & Schmicks one morning for breakfast, which was a little pricey ( I think about $14 for an average egg/toast/meat/hasbrown breakfast, and about $3 for a cup of coffee) but the breakfast was good, and it was a large portion. A better option is only a few blocks away at The Broken Yolk Cafe, where prices were a little bit more reasonable (about $9 for the same breakfast). The happy hour prices at McCormick and Schmicks were great, and it was nice to sit in the lobby and have a drink and some appetizers. When we got the bill at the end of our stay there were about $14/day more in charges than the quoted price online due to other fees, even though we were under the impression that the price we were quoted included all the taxes and fees. So make sure you get the total price quote up front. Overall, it was a nice place to stay but I think if we go back to San Diego we will probably choose another hotel that is a bit more updated.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston, ma", "Title": "\u201cGREAT LOCATION - GREAT QUALITY!\u201d", "Author": "betti14", "ReviewID": "UR121985143", "Content": "We came to San Diego on the day before Thanksgiving and left the day after - 2 nights at the Omni. The reviews really helped me choose this hotel. Location was perfect. Gas Lamp right at our feet. I couldn't believe how cheap parking options were. We had street parking the first night for free, and the second night $8 at the garage across the street. The hotel I believe is $32 but luckily we were able to get the other options easily. The hotel from the moment we got there til when we left was really great. The staff was excellent - they gave us a room overlooking the city, and which also looked into Petco Park. Being a baseball fan I really appreciated it! This hotel is attached to the park which is great during games, but didn't help us when we wanted to do a tour, we still had to go outside and around to the entrance of the park to enter. The room was nice - bathroom very modern - and beds comfortable. The gym was fully equipped, and the pool area was nice, though too cold to hang there the days we were there. No real view at the pool. Complimentary coffee in the lobby before 6am, then you have to pay at the coffee shop. We were so busy while there that we didn't get to spend a lot of time at the hotel, but I would have liked to use the pool and gym as they seemed great. For breakfast we got a quick bite at The Broken Yoke on 6th Ave. Spent the day at the Zoo and Safari Park, the next day at Petco Park doing a Tour, drive through Coronado Island, Quick ride to Tijuana (20 min ride), and then went to the USS Midway before heading to the airport early evening. Yes we did a lot, but there were no lines and no traffic to any of these places due to the holiday, so it we were able to do a lot. My only complaint was the front desk charged me for the large bottle of bottled water in the mini-bar - $9, which we never touched. I went downstairs and asked about it, and they immediately took off the charge. I just thought it was not a great thing to do to a guest when to assume they use the mini-bar without even checking. We got such a good rate for the hotel ($97 on hotels.com) that I didn't have a lot of complaints. It was an excellent value for what we got. The valet and concierge was super helpful, and I really felt like I was in the heart of everything. I would absolutely recommend. The Hard Rock next door looked very intriguing as well, and might try that place if I go back, but overall I think the Omni is the best value we could have gotten. We also looked at the Hilton Bayfront but I'm glad we chose Omni, it was closer to where we wanted to be (we had already done so much walking), and with the weather we wouldn't have been able to enjoy their signature waterfront pool anyway.

What I noticed upon arrival and spending a great deal of time out front was the Valet service was extremely busy, maybe understaffed, and trying to ensure everything was taken care of. The problem was when they got a break in the incoming traffic, the ones and twos that came in received little to know attention. Several times I watched as elderly couples and families, unload their own cars, grab the luggage cart and fill it themselves, while several employees stood to the side (and yes they was an employee from the valet service, somewhere from inside and what appeared to be a bell hop \u2013 although I am not sure if they have them, perhaps it was another valet employee. This bothered me as at one point I felt compelled to assist an elderly woman getting out of a car as the employees stood around and conversed loudly. Given the benefit of doubt, maybe they were on break, but breaks should be done where customers are, otherwise it is not a break. My reasoning behind mentioning this is it happened several times. Moving on \u2013 Inside the hotel the facilities where nice, except I about fell out of my chair when I saw the Internet prices. I guess this is becoming the norm. But in their defense, they did allow you to pprint your boarding passes free, which my guess this day in age with the 3G/4G craze, it is all the hotel can do to make money from the Internet.

Many times you find yourself in a large room with dated furniture or a small room with the latest and greatest fixtures, but the $600.00 lamp is in the corner with the 35 foot fake plant or in a place where a lamp would not matter. But these rooms were extremely well thought out in design and functionality. Many thanks to whom ever had the intuition to make a hotel room an experience, not a 70s basement room. Oh and the view, well look at the pictures I cannot do it justice. Lastly is the location. Just off the beaten path, this hotel is well placed and nestled off the strip. I recommend this hotel, regardless of the staff issues (everyone has their days, I know I have). Do let me add, this was my only issue with the staff as the remaining time I was there, they satisfied our every need. Thank you. I want to reiterate, I did not stay here but over the course of time, I was able to make a sound judgment on my thoughts of this hotel. In hindsight the amount of time I spent there, I should have just stayed the extra 3 hours and got a room.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best hotels of its type\u201d", "Author": "ADSOxford", "ReviewID": "UR120348367", "Content": "I have stayed here several times over the last few years and I will keep returning because this really is a fine hotel.

Within walking distances are scores of restaurants and shops to suit every taste and making it easy for a dine around or group off property dinner. The hotel is across the street from the San Diego Convention Center and next to a trolley station for those wanting to expand their San Diego experience. What\u2019s also nice is the hotel is only four miles from the international San Diego airport (which equates to about an approximate 14 minute ride and $15 cab fare). The hotel has easy valet access and drop off at the front of the hotel. This is especially nice as not all of the hotels in the Gaslamp area have this nice feature. The lobby is large, but not intimidating, with high ceilings and a nice sitting area. Adjacent to this area is a McCormick and Schmick\u2019s Restaurant (they also handle the in room dining). There are four large elevators to take guests to the 21 floors and an escalator to the large ballroom on the 4th level. The hotel also features a nice fitness center and a small pool area. On a practical side if you are staying at the Omni San Diego, it has 511 sleeping rooms averaging 360 square feet. My recommendation for the best view is to request the top floors as looking west you have a view of the bay and ocean (and Coronado Bridge) and looking east and north is a view of the city. Views from the lower floors are less impressive and you'll hear more of the noise from the trolley station, Petco baseball park or from the partying Gaslamp crowds. The staff is terrific, the place is clean but does need the upgrades mentioned in earlier reviews.

This hotel is in a great location - but there are a few things to consider noise-wise. If you're a baseball fan, the hotel is adjacent to Petco Park. You can even see the park from some high floor windows inside the hotel (although it's more fun to be INSIDE the park!) I stayed on the side away from the ballpark so I can't confirm noise levels during games (not that the Padres have too many full houses these days.) I didn't notice much annoying traffic or noise inside the hotel during the three game days I was there. What can be a deal-breaker noise-wise is if you're on the side facin the convention center. BE WARNED: not only is there noise from the light rail (intercom announcements from conductor and occasional bells from approaching trams) there are loud REAL TRAIN WHISTLES with passing cargo trains. The whistles can blow at all hours of night and day. The hotel does provide earplugs (check the nightstand drawers) but not sure those will help, especially light sleepers. I happen to like trains and even I had to admit, this was a bit annoying at times. Otherwise the hotel is a great, clean 4* hotel. The exterior design is modern. The staff is polite, relaxed and helpful (and oddly enough... quite goodlooking...) The rooms are up to date decor-wise (except the TVs... need to get with the flat-screen movements, Omni Team.) The rooms have great views (on the high floors) and probably not so bad on the lower floors either as you can look over the harbour or Gaslamp District. If you're in SD for a conference - it's right across from the Convention Center. It's within minutes walking to the seaside / port district that's filled with a few parks, marinas and restaurants. Being a the corner of the Gaslamp District, the Omni is close to TONS of restaurants, bars, shops. This means the Omni is wonderfully convenient for going out in evenings and for a easy return \"home\" after lively during game days and special events. Would I stay here again - definitely. I think it's actually one of the best hotels in the city - and I walked around the district to scour others. It's all about location - location - location. Don't let the train noise be a deterrent. This is convenient for public transit (and taxis) and it's a modern place to kick back and use as a base to explore SD.

I would also recommend self parking at the ACE lot at K and 6th for $8 weekday and walk a half block to the hotel instead of the $30 plus tip valet parking that is offered by the hotel.

I'll start out first with all the positive aspects of the hotel because there are so many. First off, we requested and received 2 connecting rooms. The rooms are a nice size, clean, and beautifully furnished. We also had a great view of the city, bay and convention center. The hotel is directly next to Petco Park with a bridge connecting the hotel and Park. This allows for in and out access throughout the game. Baseball fans will really love staying so close to the park. There is excitement in the air during home stays and you will see players in the hotel as well. At the pool you can hear the fans cheering and from the top floors you can catch a glimpse of the game from the hallway windows. There are endless dining options all within blocks of the hotel. You can find any type of food and choose a casual or more upscale option. The pool is fantastic and warm. The girls loved going for a swim each afternoon. The lounge chairs are comfortable and the wait staff is very friendly and attentive. The food and drinks by the pool are reasonably priced. The valet staff was fast retrieving our car and helpful with directions when needed. The doorman David was very friendly and always willing to offer directions or advice when asked. Justin the concierge offered some good food options close to the hotel and also in La Jolla. People have mentioned taking public transportation to get around the San Diego area but with smaller children I would recommend a car. We never had much difficulty finding parking. I also must note that the Omni is very family friendly. That is the main reason we choose this hotel over others. The children always felt welcome and the guests didn't seem to mind their presence. There are many families in the hotel but the children are all well behaved and do not seem to effect the stay of couples or business travelers traveling without children. Now onto the negative....having said all these positive things I hate to bring up the negative but this one experience left a lasting impression that just won't go away. Halfway into our stay we were woke up at around 1:30am by lound partying that began at the elevator and continued in the room next door. This noise not only woke us up but our daughter sleeping next door. Once it becuase clear that the party was not going to end I called the front desk. They noted my concern and immediately sent security up. After finally opening the door there was a lound confrontation with security that spilled into the hallway with yelling and screaming. After yelling into the telephone and slamming drawers the noise did die down, 2 hours later. Needless to say sleep is a major reason for vacation and there was very little sleep that night. The next morning while in the shower my husband receives a knock at the door. It was after 8am and I assumed it was management checking up on us to appologize for the inconvience of the night before. I was wrong. It was security addressing a noise complaint about our children. The security guard was very nice and understood the children weren't being loud. He knew about the incident the night before and realized it was an immature attempt at retaliation. He also discussed the idea of moving us to a new room. I immediately went to the front desk and spoke with the day manager. I wanted him to know that we were happy and well settled into our current room and that we did not want to move. I did, however, want him to know that there was no way I was going to lose another night of sleep. He assured me that the guest next door would be checking out by noon and that it would not be a problem. I do not blame the Omni for how the situation was handled at the time of the incident. Unfortunately you sometimes get a bad next door neighbor. I can't imagine why someone would think it was ok to party at the Omni. If they wanted to party the Hard Rock Hotel is directly across the street. What I was disappointed in was the lack of concern by management. No one called to appologize for the lost night of sleep I recieved. No one inquired about how the children handled the yelling in the hallway. I don't think they realized what an inconvience it was to us. It would have been really simple to leave a positive impression. A handwritten note left in our room to show they recognized our discomfort would have been appreciated. A plate of cookies for the girls saying they hoped they enjoyed the rest of their stay would have went a long way. A free breakfast for one night would have said a lot and showed management cared. None of this would have taken must time or cost the hotel more than a few dollars. Instead we got no acknowledgement of what happened the night before. No phone call, no written note. So instead of remembering all the great things about the Omni and there were many, we remember an opportunity lost. I would still recommend the Omni to a friend but I would make sure they know there are lots of other hotels with similar pricing in the area. I would tell them there are lots of employees at the Omni that are great at their job and make you feel special. I just wouldn't include management in this list.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service and Location!\u201d", "Author": "Izk_KC", "ReviewID": "UR116731550", "Content": "Our stay was great.

If you are lucky enough the get a West facing room the view is of San Diego harbor and Coronado Island. I arrived on a Friday evening and the street scene in the blocks around the hotel was vibrant. Hoards of 30 somethings on the streets having a good time at the many bars and restaurants of the gaslamp quarter. The business rooms are across the street and called Gallery 1, 2, and 3. These were state of the art. The catering was also exceptional-we had lunch and dinner brought in, and the menu was varied enough to accommodate everyone's tastes. One unique feature of the hotel- There is a sky bridge connecting the hotel to Petco Park, so nothing could be more convenient to take in a baseball game. Also the San Diego Convention Center is right across the street, and there's a light rail stop next door where one can catch a trolley to the Mexican border at San Ysidro, to Fashion Valley Shopping Center, and Old Town San Diego, the ancient Presidio of San Diego.

Also, the climate control in the room worked great. We couldn't hear it or feel the air blowing on us.

I even called the desk when I couldn't sleep because of the parties. They told me it would end at 10 p.m. but it went on till after 11 p.m. The bathroom was very strange. It is very modern but the problem is that the bathroom is not private at all. The person in the bedroom can hear every single noise that comes out of the bathroom because there are window slats (holes) in the walls and all the sound escapes into the other room. Plus no fan. This is fine if you are traveling alone but very uncomfortable if you have roommates. Our remote was not working right. A man came to fix it, took the remote and never returned. The thing that irritated me more than anything was the taxi drivers parked near the hotel. We told the doorman we needed a taxi that accepted credit cards because we did not have cash. So the doorman told the taxi guy this and he waved us in. Then we get to the airport and find out the man hardly speaks English and only accepts cash. I had to find an ATM in the airport and return to the taxi with cash. Meanwhile, he kept the meter running and charged me even more money. I was pissed! Be careful about a situation like this.

I was there on business and spent a lot of time in the hotel's ballroom and meeting rooms attending various events. While the hotel is lovely, well-maintained and nicely located in San Diego, the constant noise from the train and Convention Center made it impossible for me to sleep, even with the earplugs provided by the hotel. This made for an unpleasant stay. My room looked directly onto the train tracks and Convention Center, with views of the Bay beyond. I thought it was a little odd that the hotel had placed ear plugs on the bedside table, but when I tried to go to sleep that first night, I realized the problem quickly. The train goes by regularly, even at night, blasting its horn the whole way. I was woken up repeatedly, which made for a very poor night's sleep. Then, starting at about 6am, a large crowd assembled outside the Convention Center, cheering and shouting (who knew you could get so excited about a convention starting in the wee hours?!). It was ridiculous. I got practically no sleep. The Omni really should have done a better job of soundproofing these rooms. In their current state, I could not recommend them to anyone. I don't know if the noise level is this bad in other parts of the hotel, but if you must stay here, definitely request a room that faces the Gaslamp and not the Convention Center. The noise is a shame, because pretty much every other aspect of my stay at The Omni was positive. The hotel is nicely updated and looks lovely. Check-in was quick and easy. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Food at the McCormick's restaurant in the lobby was good. Meeting facilities in and around the ballroom were great. The proximity to the Gaslamp is wonderful-- we were able to get out to nice dinners either on foot or via a short cab ride. I imagine this would be a great place to stay during baseball season, as well, given that the hotel has a footbridge that will take you directly to Petco Park.

We had used Priceline to book the room. It was only the second time for us to use Priceline and it was not a problem at all. The front desk staff was friendly, helpful and very nice.

We have to come back for a game. We had a full day of flying and now it was time for something to eat. We walked up the very busy street, past the bars, stores, and restaurants until we found one of our liking. We picked out the Marble Room, a former brothel, and had a great burger and beer. Another block or two up the hill and we found Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. The perfect desert. Another advantage of using the Omni as a home base is that it is adjacent to the MTS railway. We used daypasses for getting around town and out to Old San Diego. We found it was better to go to the San Diego Zoo via taxi although our passes would have taken us there for free. With all the walking you do in the zoo and Balboa park we opted for the cab. Make sure you apply for the Omni program as it will entitle you to free internet and breakfast coffee and juices. We even indulged in a breakfast bagel from room service. All was good. I took wonderful morning walks in the area.

There are several railroad crossings very close to the hotel, and the clang, clang, clang of the crossing klaxons, together with the rib crushing locomotive horns which are sounded on the approach to each crossing, mean that if your room is facing the railway line you will not get any sleep at all. However, If you ask for a room at the front of the hotel, furthest from the rail line, you will barely notice the trains. Now the \"UP\" side. Right outside the hotel doors is the entrance to the Gaslight District, the old, atmospheric San Diego, where all the smart people go bar-hopping and like to be seen. The hotel is attached to the San Diego Padres baseball stadium, and giant conference and exhibition halls are just across the road (A La Birminghams NEC). The hotel is walking distance from the harbour, and it is just a few dollars for a taxi to visit the USS Midway, an aircraft carrier which is now a floating museum. The Maritime Museum next door is worth seeing (Russian sub etc). Finally, Omni Hotel is set amongst lots of other premium hotels, there are two Hilton Hotels, Marriott, etc, etc, so they will all suffer from the noise from the railway line, so it wouldnt be fair to single out the Omni.

How wrong we were! From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome, which we didn't expect as a young family staying in what we thought was predominantly a business hotel. Luke, the valet manager, was extremely friendly and remembered my name the next few days. Oliver, the bellboy, was also extremely friendly, very affable and knowledgeable about the area. He also picked up a kid's pack for our young daughter which was most appreciated as it contained lots of nice toys for her. The room was lovely with a great view over the Coronado bay and the swimming pool below. We booked this hotel via a great deal on Travelbag, so weren't expecting such a nice room. The bathroom was salubrious and the room extremely comfortable. Tip: join their SelectGuest program free of charge before visiting to get free WiFi - it's well worth it. The swimming pool and jacuzzi area were very nice - although the pool wasn't the warmest, the attendants at the pool were extremely helpful and friendly. Unlike other reviewers, we didn't have a problem with the location. It's next to the Gaslamp Quarter (pretty much in it) and next to the Convention Centre and the Baseball stadium. It's also next to some train tracks, and the trains weren't that noisy, although one night we could hear some freight trains, but it wasn't particularly bad. Another point some reviewers have mentioned is the bathroom doors. Yes, they are a little weird. When they slide they slide across, there is a little gap, but I can only see that there would be privacy issues, if your partner was deliberately trying to look in. Which is too weird to think about really. In short, they were fine. With regards to parking, you can pay $32 for valet, or $18 dollars for self parking - all in the same garage across the street. The valet was nice, but a little inconsistent - the first time we picked up the car, it had been tidied a little bit and there were two little bottles of water in the cup holders. This was a lovely touch, so we were disappointed when it wasn't repeated the second time.

The rooms are decent size, modern, and clean - I thought of it as an updated Marriott. The bed was comfortable. Staff was friendly. But overall there was a definite lack of attention to detail. Now, I don't expect a Four Seasons experience at these prices, but.... First, I signed up for their Select Guest program to take advantage of the freebies, which are generous compared to other programs. But I never did get the promised bottle of water, morning beverage, evening turn down, or Wall Street Journal (USA Today delivered instead). Second, I took advantage of the free shoe shine freebie. My shoes were picked up that evening. I asked them to leave them hanging on my door by 7am the next morning. But instead of leaving them on my door (which had the Privacy Sign up), they kept knocking away promptly at 7am until I came out of the shower to open the door. Very annoying. Third, the TV in the room did not work right. The remote clearly needed batteries. But even when using the controls on the TV itself, I had a hard time getting the guide to work. The TV would only turn on to a channel with snow rather than tuned to the set top box. And it would not easily switch. In addition, the default volume when turned on was very loud. Even after I got the TV to tune to the box, it functioned very slowly. In the end, I just gave up. Very annoying. Fourth, twice I experienced the elevators randomly missing my floor and changing directions while riding them. Have no clue how that happens. Fifth, I asked for a quite room on a high floor away from the elevators. I got most of it but their definition of a quiet room was to put me near the housekeeping area - which is not quiet at all with the staff going in and out and gossiping away. And they also put me in a handicap room without asking. That meant the closets had low hanging rods for wheelchair accessibility, bathroom had no tub, etc... And clearly it was a seldom used room because dust had gathered on the coffee machine, coffee cups and grinds. Sixth, it may be a bit unfair of me to evaluate the breakfast at the meeting since it really depends on the meeting organizer's contract, but there was no vegetarian option for the meal. They did put together a nice fruit plate which took very long to bring out. Seventh, I was planning on letting the front desk know about my stay experience, but to my surprise, when I checked out, the desk agent did not ask how my stay was. She was friendly for sure, but gave me only a quick thanks and goodbye. Finally, my stay has still not shown up on my Select Guest profile.

Pros: (1) The hotel is fairly new with contemporary decorations; (2) Great location with walking distance to tons of restaurants; (3) We thought it was targeting business travelers but we were wrong. As soon as we checked in, our son received a nice backpack with at least five toys. He was very happy about that and carried that backpack even on the airplane back home; (4) Check-in was easy and quick. Knowing the whistle of the train, we asked for a quiet room and got one. During the three nights stay, we didn't hear any whistle from the running train down the street; (5) We joined the select member program and received complimentary beverage every morning. (6) From the bell boy to the people at the front desk or concierge, everyone was friendly. (7) The gym and swimming pool are nice. Now a few cons: (1) As mentioned by some reviews, the interior wall was pretty thin. In the mid of night, we woke up when our next door neighbors talking loudly. (2) Since it is summer time, the PETCO Park hosts Padres\u2019 games every weekend. Some roads around the hotel were blocked so we did experience frustration to get to the hotel at night. (3) $32/night valet parking was expensive. However, compared to other hotels in San Diego area, it is still in a reasonable range.

There were many upscale bars and restaurants nearby, as well as several quaint shops featuring reasonably priced souvenirs. It is also within walking distance to the convention center.

Hotel is within walking distance of the Gaslamp area, which contains a good variety of restaurants and the light rail transit is a 1 minute walk. Hotel restaurant food is good but very pricey. No breakfast buffet is available so we had room service for breakfast, which was very expensive. Those on a budget would probably not want to stay here, but if you have a reasonable expense account it's a good place to stay. You should definitely join the Omni Select Guest program so you don't have to pay $10/day for internet service (membership is free).

Way to start on the right foot, Omni! We had a room on the 19th floor with a wonderful view. True, the Hilton blocked a bit of the bay view, but I can't fault the Omni for Hilton building a hotel there. The train/trolley noise that other people have mentioned didn't bother us at all, and we didn't once notice it in the middle of the night. The location was fantastic, close to shopping, restaurants, night clubs... so much to do in the Gaslamp. A little tip, try the veggie nachos at Maryjane's, a coffeeshop/restaurant on 5th, attached to the Hard Rock. Sooooo good!!

We were upgraded to a corner suite which overlooked Petco Park on one side and the Water on the other. We were on the 12th floor and also looked right below to the 6th floor pool and restaurant. The room was beautiful. It consisted of a living room with desk and tv, and a separate bedroom with tv. The bathroom had huge windows and a great sink/vanity - the only thing I would have changed was to have a seperate tub and shower. We had indicated on our select guest profile that the Omni was the first hotel on our California honeymoon and the staff were very quick to offer their congratulations. They provided us with the suite upgrade and later on in the evening sent us a congratulatory note and a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. A very wonderful gesture that we will remember from our honeymoon. The location of the hotel is right at the entrance to the Gaslamp District and everything we needed was within walking distance. We ate at the Tin Fish next door to the hotel for lunch and then Toscana Wine Bar for dinner - both fantastic.

Check-in was fast. In our room, we were greeted with some chocolates and a bottle of champagne. This was a nice b-day surprise. Our room also had the over powering smell of room freshener. We turned on air and opened our window as far as it would go. I thought the maid must have been a bit generous with the spray. Our room had 2 double beds with great linens and a comfortable bed. We were traveling with our 2 sons and other than the beds being double(Queens are always better in this situation!) the room was a nice size. We left our room to get dinner. It was a short walk into the gaslamp district. After a couple of hours we returned to our room. We then figured out why the room smelled like it did. Someone had smoked in a non -smoking room. We are always sure to request non-smoking. The smell was VERY strong. I went down to the front desk to ask for a room change. We were told one was not available that nite. There was a convention and they were full. I asked if we could pay the difference and move to a suite. A manager walked up and said the only other room that was open had a murphy bed and would not hold 4. The next nite they could move us, but the room would not have a view or be available until the afternoon. I asked for a fan or something else to help with the smell. They sent up housekeeping with a small glass jar filled with scented oil and bamboo sticks. It didn't do a thing. By the next afternoon, the smell was better, or maybe we were just used to it. We were gone all day shopping and siteseeing. Late that afternoon they said a room was available. It overlooked the pool area where a loud reception was going on. By now we thought we would just stay in our room. We went to a Padres game. Inside the Padre Logo shop at the back, was a cage area where we watched the teams warming up. A manager on the Padres tossed a ball over the fence to one of my sons. This made his trip! We found an area where Kevin Kouzmanov -3rd base- was signing autograghs. He now has 4 new fans! The stadium has an easy access to the hotel. The fitness center in the hotel was the best I have ever seen. Lots of modern machines, circuit training, free weights, personal TV's with headphones, towels, shower, etc. Spotless and not crowded. The pool area was small, crowded, noisy, and had a man smoking a cigar. We couldn't escape the smoke anywhere. (We have gotten spoiled by non smoking areas) There is a nice happy hour at the hotel resturaunt. Food was great, service was slow. We were sitting outside so that may have been the problem. Because we did not have a car, we walked everywhere. Even down to the Star of India. Shopping, eating and entertainment were all close by, safe and easy to walk to. I would return to this hotel in spite of our bad luck with the smoking smell. Hotel staff was great with recommendations.

Much of that was based on the most recent Tripadvisor reviews. However the website price was high, so for the first time I went to Priceline, as their 4* hotels were coming in around $70/night in San Diego. I was thrilled when I got to $71 and my bid was accepted by The Omni. I knew going in that valet parking would add another $30 (plus tips for each pickup) per day. This was much less than half the hotel's online rate for their lowest class of room. We checked into the hotel and the first thing I noticed was how helpful the many staff were. Although I knew the smart advice was to park in the garage across the street, it was the evening after a long day and figured that we'd valet the first night and park it ourselves after. When we got to our room on the 11th floor, the first thing I noticed was that it looked like an older hotel that had gone through a remodel. From outside you can see what appears to be old hotel and new addition. We were in the shorter, older part. A remodel doesn't bother me, however it's the how they did it that made me question the 4 or 5 star rating of this hotel. The bathroom was made larger, which is a good thing, however they used open slats into the rest of the room for some reason. There are two of them - one on each side of the freestanding sink and the two sliding doors (that don't quite meet together right) have them too. If you want, you can adjust them to see straight in (and out) of the bathroom from the rest of the room. The major downside of this is that all the sounds and smells of a bathroom will be shared even if the slats are turned down. The closet couldn't be closed without making a racket that could likely be heard in the neighboring room. We could hear many sounds from other rooms, which due to proximity to the gaslamp district, happened around 2:00 - 3:00AM. They came from many directions as we were in the middle of the floor. We did get the Select Guest benefits which included a nice beverage service and free internet, although we didn't use the internet much during this stay. For the price we paid, the hotel was what we would expect - the high point being the courteous and helpful staff. But had we paid regular online rates, I would have been severely disappointed. There are too many other nice hotels downtown to go out of my way to stay at The Omni again. I'd take a chance on Priceline again, so I wouldn't know what I'm getting. But I can't expect it to be any worse at any of the other (Priceline rated) 4* hotels.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe best!!!\u201d", "Author": "Dsallen74", "ReviewID": "UR39271524", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Omni for two nights and our stay was FANTASTIC!

He taught me some great short cuts in San Diego saving me valuable time and gave great recommendations on things to do. - The people at the front desk were the ultimate professionals that handled a real sticky situation with such grace and dignity.

Its also open 24 hours a day. - The pool was first class....the fireplace that is shared between the pool and lounge area was awesome. They serve you drinks and food - felt better then the Loew's hotels! - Even the hotel engineering service was unbeatable. They had to fix my a/c in my room. They were there in three minutes, had it fixed within 30 minutes and the man was so very nice and polite. - Noice level - was worried about the train tracks and hearing my neighbors after reading one of the reviews here. I heard neither. I slept like a baby! - Most of all, I felt completely safe as a woman traveling alone here.

The bathroom was nice and had lots of complimentary items, but we also had trouble hanging up our towels? No hooks or bar racks? Every morning before heading out to one of the sights (Legoland, Sea World, Zoo) we would visit the fitness center on the 6th floor and fill our water bottles up with fresh, ice cold lemon water. This helped quench our thirst during the long day walking around the parks. Much better than plain water!!! We also saved money on the parking lot across the street. Tons of restaurants all around the hotel and all within walking distance. Due to a problem with Priceline, we had to check into a different hotel after staying 4 wonderful nights at the Omni. We moved into the Grand Hyatt for our last night of our stay and we were sadly disappointed. We could see the Omni from the Hyatt and were ALL homesick for our former residence.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tijuana, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cVery very nice!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Jael", "ReviewID": "UR33208231", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights. Our wedding night and the next night. We are from Tijuana, B.C., Mexico and got married there on a Saturday and we were going to fly for our honeymoon on Monday from SD, so we crossed the border after our wedding. We booked the cheapest room, since we didn\u2019t want to spend our money here but in the honeymoon, but we did write on the comments from the reservation that it was our wedding night, so\u2026 when we got there they gave us one of the best rooms available. It was amazing. By far, that\u2019s the best hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in. It was beautiful. Location: Is located right next to the Petco park, it actually has a bridge to go there specially made for guests who want to go to the games. It\u2019s in Downtown SD, in front of the Convention Center, and like 4 blocks away from Horton Plaza. It was only like 10 bucks for the taxi to takes us to the airport, it\u2019s very near. There are tons of restaurants around the hotel. Room: It was amazing. They upgraded our room to a corner one in the 14th floor, so we had two walls of windows. The bed was super comfortable. It\u2019s super clean. The carpet was very nice and new (well\u2026 the hotel was new). The bathroom was big and nice. There is a shower and a tub. Very spacious. We had a desk and a chair, along with flowers. It had a big closet with a safe, hangers and bag for dry clean and laundry. Lobby: Very big and beautiful. I don\u2019t remember a lot of the lobby but it was nice. Right in front of the hotel you catch a taxi; they are always parked in the front. Service: Very good. As I said, they upgraded us to a better room which was nice. They also gave us Moet & Chandon champagne because it was our wedding night. When we made our reservation we said we would get there by 2 am, and we actually did like at 4 am. As soon as we entered the lobby the receptionist asked us how was our wedding and congratulated us!!!! He knew it was us! (No, I was not wearing my wedding dress anymore). We thought that was a very nice touch. We ordered pizza from room service and it was AMAZING, it was very good, and it only took them like 20 minutes to make it, even though it was like 5 am! We didn\u2019t even have to go check out; there was an envelope on the door with our receipt. Very nice!

Positive: 1. Excellent Location in Gaslamp District. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance (we ate at La Strada, Blue Coastal Seafood and MaryJane in Hard Rock Hotel - all located on 5th Street - we high recommend all three!). The convention center is across the street and there's a walkway connected to Petco Stadium. The Westfield mall is about 10 minute walk. 2. Signing up for the Guest Select program is a definite must - Free beverages in the morning, pressing of clothes and internet access definitely put this hotel a step above other hotels that will charge you for these. Of note - The coffee and orange juice we had each morning was great! The croissant we added to our beverage service (you pay about $4.00 extra) is enough to split for 2 people. 3. Another advantage of signing up for the program ahead of time is that you can customize your stay. Since we signed up beforehand, check-in was also a breeze since they had all our information on file. We pretty much said our name, the front desk handed us the key and that was it! 4. The room we had was clean and beautiful. We were on the 20th floor with a gorgeous view of the water. Negative: 1. As other reviewers mentioned, the train runs in between the hotel and convention center and does blow 3 or 4 distinct whistles as it passes through. The first morning, it woke me up at 5:45 AM and a second one later around 7:30 AM. For a very light sleeper (such as myself), it was loud enough to feel like the windows were open. However, my husband (who is a moderate sleeper) never heard anything. If you do have sleeping concerns, request a room with a view towards the city and not the water. 2. As everyone mentioned, parking at the hotel is $30.00 per night. We parked adjacent to the hotel (it's a pretty large structure right off K street...you can't miss it) which is $8.00/night on weekday and $16.00/night on weekend. The structure appears to be open 24/7 as there were attendants available when we arrived that evening at 11:00PM. I wouldn't recommend driving around if you plan to stay around the Gaslamp district and immediate surrounding areas since parking seemed to be an issue. There are plenty of taxis or people riding bicycles that offer rides if you're tired. As point of reference, a taxi ride from the hotel to the Westfield mall was about $7.00. We thought it was very safe to walk around at night as long as you keep on the main street where all the restaurants and bars are located. 3. I do agree with one reviewer that the walls are a bit thin. During my stay, the neighbors were quiet (I heard an occasional cough and when they used the restroom, it did sound like they were in the same room). However, I can definitely see where it can be unpleasant if you get noisy neighbors. 4. Although the bathroom was beautifully decorated, it wasn't well thought out in terms of where to hang your towels. There's only 1 towel holder inside the shower and two small hooks that barely held a towel. Though not really a \"negative\" thing in my opinion, it was a minor annoyance. If you hang a hanger (from the closet) on one of the hooks in the bathroom, that served as a pretty decent impromptu towel holder. Nevertheless, despite the \"negatives,\" these observations did not impact our stay in a negative way.

The location is perfect and the accomodations are first-rate. I followed the advice from other TripAdvisor members and joined Omni's Select Guest program. I called the hotel a couple of days prior to my arrival and they added my Select Guest number to the reservation. When we arrived at about noon, I was pleased to be told that the room was ready -- I hadn't even asked for early check-in. The room was clean, well-appointed, and had a decent view, although it was not a bay view. My parents arrived later in the day, and had also booked on Priceline. I don't know if it was just luck of the draw but they got a room with a beautiful view of the bay. Perhaps the rooms with king beds are on the bay side of the hall and the doubles are on the other side?? With the Select Guest program we got free morning beverages and newspapers and also were able to have two items pressed for free (which was great because we were there for a wedding and I had my shirt pressed.) I also got free internet access. Other people have commented about noise from the trains or adjoining rooms. We were on the 19th floor and didn't have any noise problems. Some people have also said the \"louvered\" panels in the bathroom make for lack of privacy. Our room didn't have the louvered panels -- it had a large sliding glass door. It was an unusual design, but wasn't a problem. My parents' room had the louvered panels and they didn't mention any bathroom privacy problems. Their room also had a small balcony with sliding doors and sculped carpet, while our room just had a window that opened slightly. All of the staff members were very friendly and helpful. Every time I called for anything, the phone was answered on the first ring and I was greeted by name -- as cheesy as this may sound, I felt like royalty. The neighborhood has great nightlife and lots of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. Follow the tips here and self-park in the garage across the street (6th and K Parkade).

I will take the car out for the whole day tomorrow and park there at night.

The hotel has great staff and were very friendly from the moment we pulled into the valet till we pulled out. The valets and the bellmen were great. Ashley at the check-in was great, she explained all the amenities and etc. and also the room. When we walked into the room, it was just aweinspiring. The hotel also provided us with a $40 breakfast voucher which we used for breakfast room service. For lunch we went to their lake terrace pool area on the 6th floor. It is a nicely set area but very windy due to the height and facing the harbor. All the loungers were taken and everyone was trying to sit in the sun due to the wind. We finally found two loungers in the sun and ordered lunch of super nachos and tofu sandwich. The food and drinks we ordered were great and the waitress was great also provided the prompt service. The bedding in the room was great, the bathroom was different than the other hotels, though very chic.

The hotel is across the street from the Gaslamp district, where there are lots of restaurants to choose from. It is also right next to the San Diego Trolley line. Some people have complained about the noise from the trains, but it didn't bother us at all. There were, however, baseball games going on each night of our stay. The baseball stadium is practically attached to the hotel and the noise from the cheering crowds, all the way up to midnight, was jarring. Other than that our stay was perfect. We joined the Omni Select Guest program, which is their frequent guest program. It is free to join and members receive lots of extra amenities, including coffee, drinks and a newspaper of your choice delivered to your room each morning.

Booked hotel/air through Priceline. Omni was perfect from check-in to check-out. Room was spacious, modern and very clean. We were on the 13th floor and had a view of Petco Park (San Diego Padres stadium). The World Baseball Classic was going on while we were there so there was activity in the stadium. Housecleaning did a wonderful job in cleaning the rooms and making them smell fresh. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious with a nice shower/bath and very clean. Plenty of towels were provided. The location of this hotel is perfect. We did rent a car because we wanted to do things outside of San Diego. Parking at the hotel is $30 but there was a garage across the street that was less. Transportation is abundant with trolleys, cabs, buses, etc and wouldn't have needed the car if we weren't leaving the city. We toured San Diego University which was around 15 min drive from the Omni. After the college tour we drove to La Jolla and Mission Beach which is only a short drive from the city. La Jolla has many beautiful sights and a small beach full of seals. Mission Beach has an amusement park and a boardwalk with skaters, rollerbladers, bikers, runners, etc. Both areas offered free parking. Took a city tour with Old Town Trolley. This is a great way to get a feel of the city and the sights. The guides were all very knowledgeable and fun. Ate lunch in Old Town San Diego at the Cafe Coyote. Food was very good and a fun place. Drove over to Coronado and had a delicious brunch at the famous Hotel Del Coronado. Hotel Del Coronado is grand and the grounds are beautiful and right on the beach. The beach is very clean here, we were lucky to see a herd of dolphins swim by while walking along the beach. We did not experience the hotel restaurant but did get coffee and tea from Morsels. Hotel Conceirge was most helpful. We were able to purchase activity tickets at the hotel. We spent a lot of time at Gaslamp Quarters which is in walking distance of the Omni. Many restaurants, bars and shops are located in Gaslamp Quarters. Restaurants we experienced in the Quarters were Whiskey Girl, Hard Rock Cafe, and Ghiardelli (for dessert, mmmmm) . Nightlife is great here if that is what you are looking for. Wasn't able to experience the nightlife since I was with my 19 yr old daughter but it looked like lots of fun. Thursday we went to the San Diego Zoo and had a great time also not far from the Omni. Next time will go to the Wild Animal Park. The hotel was very quiet and private. We were not bothered by any noise whatsoever. Pool at the Omni was really nice with heated water and a hot tub. A nice view of the area from the pool level. There is a service phone that you can order food/drinks from the restaurant. You can bring food/drink items but no glass. Beware of the gulls with your food and do not leave unattended. A couple had left food (which I thought was very rude) and the gulls were helping themselves. In conclusion we would definitely stay at the Omni San Deigo again. Everything was top notch and we had a great vacation. Thank you Omni, we will return!", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cFabulous downtown hotel with water view\u201d", "Author": "Love-to-wander-Mom", "ReviewID": "UR26422377", "Content": "We stayed at the Omni the last 2 nights of our 5 night San Diego family vacation. I am so so glad we stayed here last. Otherwise I would have never got my kids to step foot in our other 2 hotels. I had picked each hotel based on the attractions we were going to that day. Thus while at Legoland I suggest you stay up north in Carlsbad; Mission Valley for the Zoo and La Jolla; and then move south to downtown while you tour Coronado and the downtown area. This Omni is only 4 years old and it looks brand new. It is modern without being weird or stark. The glass makes it open and airy and the large windows make the lobby and the hotel rooms feel so huge. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. Their maps were better than any I found from AAA or online. I would suggest you pay the extra for the premium room with a view of the water. We were in #1906 and the view of the water was spectacular. Each morning I am normally anxious to grab a shower and hit the town, but here I wanted to sit and enjoy the view while lingering over my coffee, juice and paper (all free and delivered to your room each a.m. if you sign up for the Omni frequent guest program). But you do need food, so by 9:30 am we would head down to the restaurant on the 1st floor for the nice buffet. $13 for continental or $19 for cold & hot choices--beverages, lots of fruit, eggs cooked to order and all of the usual 4* restaurant choices. Buffet is open till 11 am. (What a great idea.) We recommend the bed and breakfast package that included $30 valet parking and a $40 coupon for breakfast each a.m. With a full tummy, we never needed lunch till 2 or 3 pm each day. Decor in the room is very nice. Yes, there is sliding bathroom door. No big deal. In fact I grew to like it since it meant no one ever hit me when I was in the bathroom and they decided they wanted to come in. Lots of fluffy towels, 2 waffle style robes and a neat way to use shelves to give you a lot of vanity counter space. Yes, there was a train about 2 am but you can roll over and go back to sleep or use the free earplugs provided in the nightstand if you are worried about it. Milk and cookies were included with our turndown services. Of course the kids loved that. They have a backpack of kids' games if you need them but we never did. The outdoor 6th floor pool is very unique and the jacuzzi was built by a parent because he understood you want to sit in there yet keep an eye on your kids 15 feet away in the pool. There are many restaurants in walking district. Just go 1 block over and you are in the Gaslamp district with block after block of choices. The red trolley line stops right outside the hotel so that is an easy way to see the city if you do not have a car. The Convention center is across the street. The Coronado Bridge is 5 minutes away. We drove over and parked about 2 blocks from the famous Hotel del Coronado. We walked on the sidewalk, went in \"the Del\" to look for the ghost of Kate Morgan (the Del's resident ghost) and then changed in their restrooms and hit the great beach right in front of The Del. Del's ice cream shop, coffee shop and bar were easy stops for refreshments. The U.S. Midway, all of the other Harbor activities and even Balboa Park are 5-15 minutes from the Omni. So do not think you can only stay at the Omni if you are downtown for business. It is well-suited for sight-seeing too. In conclusion: we were originally WOWed by the view, but we came to realize everything about the Omni is very very nice.

Got a great rate that included free valet parking, through the Omni website. We had a well appointed room on a high floor overlooking the bay, with great sunset views. Room was spotlessly clean, comfortable and modern. I would stay there again without a second thought. We had only two complaints about the room. First, there seems to be a trend away from queen size beds. Two full beds is a little annoying and just a bit too cozy when there are two adults and two kids. But the Omni, like so many other hotels, only offers one king or two fulls. The second criticism of the room is the funky bathroom door. It looks very cool, but it doesn't offer much in the way of privacy. It is essentially a sliding barn door style, so it covers the main opening of the doorway, but leaves gaps open all the way around. My wife, in particular, was not very happy about that. We also had a pretty bad experience at McCormick & Schmick's, the restaurant located on the first floor of the hotel. Without getting into the details, they were understaffed and had not ordered sufficiently for the weekend, so they ran out of a lot of menu items early. The place was packed with unhappy diners, because the kitchen was so painfully slow. To their credit, the management handled things correctly. Ultimately, our entire meal was paid for by the restaurant. A few days later, the general manager called me personally to apologize and sent another $50 gift card to use the next time we're in San Diego.

I booked a \"half for the holidays\" special at $159.00 a night with free parking for each night and a coupon book for shopping and free coffee coupons for Starbucks. We had signed up on their website as a \"Select Guest\" which gives you a choice of things in your room such as extra pillows and choice of room preference and type of newspaper. If you sign up take advantage of the free beverage service in the morning and you can order a bagel or muffin for a few dollars extra. Everything we asked for was in the room upon arrival. We asked for a quiet room with extra pillows and were put in a top floor room with a great view of the city. During the night my husband and I kept getting a strange kind of smell coming from the air vent above the bed when the air conditioner turned off. It almost smelled like methane and would be gone in a few minutes. We figured that being on the top floor on a corner that we were in the path of the main exhaust vents of the hotel. I became a bit concerned the next morning when my husband returned to our room with our Starbucks coffee. As soon as he came into the room the smell was very strong and he called the front desk and within a minute there was maintenance at our door changing the filter. We didn't think that was the source of the odor so they sent a Manager up who immediately gave us a new room. Our new room turned out to be an awesome suite with sweeping views of the harbour and city and the stadium at Petco Park. All I can say is that the management went above and beyond to make sure our stay was comfortable. Front desk staff, doormen, bell hops, valet were all super friendly and always had a smile. The location is great, just steps from the Gaslamp area with great shopping and restaurants all within walking distance. The only negative was that there was a train just outside the hotel and when it went by it was rather loud. It never woke me up but you could not miss it if you are a light sleeper.

We visited the hotel in September 2007 and at that time we were overcharged in two different ways. (Charged for valet parking even though it was included in package, charged for \"complimentary\" room upgrade at check-in). Last year, I brought it to the attention of management, and was assured it was not typical and would not happen again. Precisely the same billing error occurred this year. It is apparent that there is a glitch in the computer system and/or poor training of employees, and I find it annoying that I have to pick over the bill with a fine tooth comb and then spend 15 minutes straightening out their errors, particularly when I have already brought those errors to their attention a year before.

The location of the hotel cannot be beat - on the doorstep of the Gaslamp Quarter and all the action, seconds from the Convention Center, and minutes from the colorful Seaport village. You can reach everywhere on foot - dinning, shopping, and sightseeing. It is a very lively and safe neighborhood. On our arrival, we were greeted by very friendly and courteous staff, our really spacious and spotless clean room was ready on our arrival and what a VIEW. My mother and brother were staying at another hotel in Diego and once we compared their hotel with ours, we immediately decided to have them move in with us at the Omni. The hotel made sure that we got an equally nice room - despite the very short notice - and my mother and brother were given a room on the same floor as us, and with an equally magnificent view of the bay and the bridge. Service is impeccable, the staff extremely friendly and the room and the spacious bathroom equipped with all the amenities you can think of. I have to mention here two people who were exceptionally efficient and courteous: Ms. Elizabeth Marking and Ms. Kelly Craig both of whom went way beyond the call of duty to help on two separate problems that we were facing. They could not have done more and my family and I cannot be more appreciative. Would I stay there again? Is there anywhere else to stay?! There is no doubt in my mind that the lovely hotel experience we had contributed to our enjoyment of the visit and this charming city. Would I recommend this hotel to others?

That is the best part of this hotel. If you are a baseball fan and want to watch a game at PETCO park, the fourth floor of the hotel leads to a bridge that connects to the park, only allowing hotel guests to pass in and out of. Gaslamp quarter is right around the corner along with a lot of restaurants, which is much needed. Omni, as far as I can see, only has McCormick & Schmick and the poolside bar food available for guests. I did not see a room service menu in the room. If you are looking to party, this is not the place for you. The bar at Mc & S closes at 11:30pm daily. However, there are many hotels around with clubs, bars, lounges to visit. The Omni caters to more older people as opposed to the party crowd on Saturday night. That was fine by us, my fiance and myself. We like to go out, have fun and come home to peace & quiet. The rooms were definately quiet. I couldn't even hear the trains/metros pass by every five minutes like you do when you are on the street. The room was comfortable. I you're not used to feather pillows definatley bring your own. Valet costs $30.00 daily (not included in your room rate). This is very reasonable considering other parkades charge about 18.00 everytime you park. If you do the express checkout, which is very handy, don't forget to leave your minibar key, believe me they will charge you to replace the key. All of the staff was very friendly and always asked if we needed directions. My fiance left two dress shirts in the closet by accident and I, being pessimistic, thought they would be lifted by sticky fingers, like at other hotels. I called, got transferred to the housekeeping dept (lost and found) and they had the shirts and are Fed Ex-ing them as I type this. Overall, a very good experience. My only negative issue is the lack of restaurants. This could also be a tactic to keep party folks out as well. Few meal recommendations: Mary Jane had decent breakfasts. Lou and Mickey's was very tasty. I had the Salmon. Everything was a la carte. The hostess recommended a bottle of red wine, a Meritage called The Prisioner from Napa, $70.00. Very robust and smooth with a great nose. Go to Fred's vs. Rockin' Baja. Make a desert trip to Ghiardelli for a brownie sundae. Makes you think you're in San Francisco.

We stayed over Labor Day weekend and had just stayed at the Omni LA, where the service and staff were excellent so we had been expecting the same experience. However that wasn't so. The day we checked in, we asked the concierge if there were any restaurants that had fast service as we had wanted to go to Sea World at night to experience their Summer Nights promotion. However, the concierge didn't even know that they were open until 11 because she told us \"you might want to save your money because it's quite expensive and they close soon.\" This was about 6:30 p.m. i would think that a concierge would know what time major attractions open and close. After I told her that it was open until 11, to answer my question regarding a place with fast service, she suggested a place next to the hotel that we had eaten at upon our arrival earlier that day. When we told her this, she said that she didn't know any other locations and wished us \"good luck.\" We ended up spending an extra 20-25 minutes walking around the Gaslamp District trying to find a place. With the many restaurants, I would think that there are some that provide fast service and something a concierge would have knowledge about. I guess we expected too much from a concierge after receiving such excellent service at the Omni LA. The valet was also quite slow at times. Upon returning for the evening one night, we were the only car that pulled in. I was in the car for about a minute gathering our items and the attendant didn't even come to the car even though we could clearly see him standing at the valet door doing nothing. Even after we got out of the car, it took a while for him to come over to get our keys. Again, I guess we expected too much after receiving such great service up in LA. We did let the manager know about these experiences and she did give us complimentary buffets, but it's hard to recover when these experiences were the initial experiences with the hotel. It was truly a letdown after reading all the rave reviews on here. The room was decent; nothing spectacular. The door to the bathroom was a sliding one that didn't even cover the whole door frame so there wasn't full closure; don't know who came up with that design. I guess that was better than having the rooms with the shutters. Compared to the Omni LA, Omni San Diego was definitely a let down.

We had a semi stocked mini bar, as there were two empty bottles of Grey Goose bottles, that had the caps replaced and put back in their perspective places.

We watched the fireworks from the room at the same time as the Olympic Swim trials. The Concierge, Connie, hit is great three times. Oceanaire for seafood three blocks away, Filipi's in little Italy, and Dusinni's bar for Happy Hour. July 4, we are at the Omni Bar for Happy hour. Hamburgers $1.95, Sushi $1.95, and Three sliders with blue cheese for $4.95. Go for a Padres game if you can.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntington Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cHomerun Package\u201d", "Author": "KenVicLee", "ReviewID": "UR17351200", "Content": "Let me preface this by saying this is my third stay at the Omni San Diego, once in 2004, once in 2006 and now this year. Each visit has been part of a Homerun package meaning just one night in the hotel. Not a fair way to rate a hotel in my estimation. That said I have to admit I was less \"wowed\" this time than two years ago. We were four couple attending the $299.00 Homerun package which consisted of one night in the hotel, two Padres tickets, two breakfasts the next morning in McCormick's & Schmitt's, cracker jacks and a bag of peanuts in your room and free valeting parking (a $25.00 value). Not too far off the price this package was in 2004 when without valet parking thrown in we paid $179.00 (but Petco Park had just opened as had the adjacent hotel which was running a special to get bookings). Service was exceptional at check-in. Three couples were allowed to go to their rooms at 2:00 pm, my room was delayed \"up to 30 minutes.\" They called in 15 minutes. When I went to obtain the room key I couldn't help but notice the line. So while we had flown through check-in fifteen minutes earlier, not everyone was so lucky trying to check in closer to the normal arrival time of 3:00 pm. Two of us were provided with an extra freebie, \"two beers, two brauts\" from the pool bar or the restaurant. Since it wasn't part of the package I asked the gal as the front desk about it when I went to pick up my room key. There was no explanation about the inequity but to her credit she immediately got the assistant restaurant manager to add one \"two beers, two brauts\" onto the back of his business card for one of the couples. Very classy and very much appreciated. Three of us received the \"cracker jacks and peanuts\" in our room right after check in (although pretzels were substituted in two cases, chex mix in the other for the peanuts) and the fourth couple had to call to get what was intended as a cute buy in to the baseball theme. It seems they were unprepared delivering on their own reservations. Not the right product (who eats pretzels at a ball game! :)) and they had forgotten one of us. Two couples went to the pool. There was only one server bringing drinks. The prices weren't too bad. Three beers, two mojitos and a margarita only set up back $39.00. But the server had added a second margarita which was annoying...and it took quite a few minutes to get it corrected before we felt comfortable returning to the room. Now I am just belly-aching but I was aware that the first year we purchased this package the baseball tickets were on a lower level and very near the catwalk that takes you from the third floor of the hotel into Petco Park. This year we were ten rows from the top of the stadium albeit nearly directly behind home plate. The Padres are not doing well in the standings so I am not sure what to attribute the decline in the quality of tickets. I love this hotel. I like the rooms. I like the beds. I like being able to open my window over the pool to listen to the singer crooning out the oldies in the middle of the day. This package gives you just the standard room. I expect for a little more they have some really nice features. But most of all I like the package. I didn't like getting my room charges under the door in the morning and seeing a second $40.00 pool charge on there. Again to their credit they promptly removed it as I was checking out but again I say...you are a four-star hotel, this shouldn't happen. One couple tried to leave at 6:00 am for another commitment they had. Valet gave them the bad news the lights had been left on and the battery was dead. One of the valets had to jump the car with his own truck when AAA had not shown up within 30 minutes. There is just no excuse for that. And predictably (I should know better) all the large change (quarters, dimes) had been removed from my loose change pile I keep in my ash tray. I have heard the philosophical argument that valet guys think you won't miss it, feel entitled to take it, etc., etc., etc. I call it theft and am constantly annoyed that it happens. Fortunately the GPS that my wife had put in the glove box was still there so I guess I should say thanks for small favors. Great location at the base of the Gaslamp district. Handy to just about anything you want to do in downtown San Diego. Still a beautiful, generally good-service hotel after four years.

I was quite impressed - I'm glad to have booked my stay there. Some highlights: - It's maybe a slow 20 minute drive away from the airport, costing less than $20 to get there. It's literally next to Petco Stadium, so close that I could see the inside of the stadium from my room. It is located steps away from the Gaslamp district, where all the cool restaurants and clubs (and Hilo Hattie for you Hawaii lovers) are located. It's right across from the all new Hard Rock Hotel and across the street from the convention center. The check in was smooth and easy; my overall impression very good. Kathy, one of the girls working there, was very helpful - and cute. But I digress... My first impression of the room (1503) was good. It's set up in a modern, somewhat minimalist style. The bathroom was nice, but as some people here say, it is one of those sliding doors that don't seal the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, so it could feel a little embarassing if you're concerned about making noises in the bathroom. But hey - the toilet paper was nice, the soap was great, the shampoo and conditioner were fine. The towels were nice too. The only thing is that there is not a towel rack, which I didn't understand. The one thing about the shower - I didn't realize at first how it worked. Once you turn the nob to get hot water, keep in mind that there is a small lever that moves left and right to go from tub to shower. The day that I checked in, it was somewhere in the middle, and so I thought I didn't have water pressure. But actually, once I figured it out, I was just fine in the shower. My only comment was the noise outside. I heard the baseball game, which was at the stadium 3 nights in a row, so if you are looking to get sleep early, forget it. The traffic can be heard and the train can be noisy too. So if you're not an early riser, make sure that you ask for a room away from the stadium and traffic. So let's talk food and other stuff. - the restaurant McCormick & Schmicks was really good. the Chilean seabass with miso sauce was absolutely awesome. - Mary Jane's is a restaurant on 5th Street; it is part of the Hard Rock. Good breakfast, fine relatively inexpensive dinner. Good if you don't want to pay the premium of other restaurants (which there are a ton of here). - There is a Ralph's grocery store a few blocks from the hotel. You can walk there. Go there to get your bottled water, because you're not going to find it at a reasonable price anywhere else. Attractions: - The USS Midway museum was really fun. I thought that I'd be in and out - but I spent over 2 hours there. The fighter jets that they have alone are worth the visit, but the tour of the ship was really something. You have to check it out. - Next to the Midway is the Seaport Village. Fun little place for casual dining, some shopping or just to see the waters facing Coronado. It's relaxing to be there. - Coronado is about $20 taxi ride. It takes 10-15 minutes to get there. If you like the beach, check out the Hotel Del Coronado. Nice hotel. - The Gaslamp district is an attraction all its own. If you like to wine and dine, this is the place to be. There are so many nice restaurants clustered together on 5th Street, you can pretty much eat anything. Indian, seafood, sushi, Italian, Thai, Australian, steak, coffees, ice cream, pizza, sandwiches.... By the way, the BofA ATM Machine is on Island and 5th. Good to know.

As for complaints about noise from the Hard Rock - we stayed on a Friday night, after a baseball game, and we could scarcely hear a thing. The bathroom door is a sliding door that doesn't seal completely. So you don't have privacy issues, but there may not be as much of a noise barrier as some might like. No fan either. So yeah, if you're the shy type, turn on the tv before going in to do your business.

I made our reservation about 3 months prior through The Omni's web site. I requested a room on a high floor with a view over looking the stadium. That's exactly what we got. This trip was planned so we could see the Angels play the Padres for an exhibition game. 2 Days prior to our arrival, The Omni sent me an e-mail that enabled us to check in through our computer at home. I went ahead and checked in this way but, I was a little worried this might hinder my chances with getting the room we wanted. Additionally, the on-line check in told me I'd be able to check in at 2 p.m. and no waiting in line. Check in time was supposed to at 3 p.m. according to the web site. We arrived shortly before 2. A little side note, we took took the Amtrak from San Juan Capistrano to Downtown San Diego. Thought we'd try the train this time. No problems with Amtrak. We walked about 8 or 9 blocks from the train station to The Omni. Downtown San Diego has got to be one of the nicest downtown areas in the states. Over the past several years the city has done a great job revitalizing the Gas Lamp District. Oh yeah, we stopped at a place called Dick's Last Resort for lunch. The food was just okay. I'm not sure if I'd eat there again. Arrived at the Omni and went to the check in desk. The young people working the counter were very nice and professional. The girl who helped me told me our room was not ready and asked if we would mind waiting. I didn't mind at all because she said our room was located exactly where I requested. Had to wait almost an hour for it to be ready. The wait was a little bit of a downer but, it was well worth it. While waiting, I saw one of my favorite players from the Angels, Rob Quinlan, in the lobby. I think some of the players stayed at the Omni. I ran into the Angels owner Arte Moreno at the game. He was nice enough to shake my hand and smile. Back to the details with the room. We had room #1833 on the 18th floor. Check out my photos. It was a standard room, about 400 sq. ft. The only weird thing about the room was the bathroom door. The door was on a hanging track and slid to open and close. It didn't really give much privacy. People are able to hear you do your business. My suggestion, turn on the water, so nobody can hear you. I'd read many complaints from others here regarding the trains and the trolley. This is one of the reasons I wanted to be on the stadium side of the hotel. There is still some noise on this side of the building. It really didn't bother us though. Ask the hotel for some extra pillows and sleep with a pillow over your head. This helped me. I heard one train horn at 3 a.m., that was the only time I was bothered. Overall, I give our experience 4 out of 5 stars. Will we stay there again? Absolutely. I'm already thinking about another trip.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "unknown_to_nyc", "ReviewID": "UR14555838", "Content": "Just came back from SD.

He told us he would try to get reservations, as it was popular on a Saturday night. He called the restaurant and made sure to give his own name....hmmm...I wonder why. We went to the restaurant, it was 90% empty on a Saturday night and the food was sub-par. Out of curiosity, I asked the manager of the restaurant what their Zagat rating was and was told...they have never been rated. Why would the concierge lie to us and push us to go to this particular restaurant, spend $150 dollars on a terrible dinner, and make sure the restaurant credited him with the reservation? I wonder.... If you don't like noise, you should also think twice about this hotel. We asked for a room on a top floor (got 15th) given other warnings about the noise, and even being that high didn't help.

We were able to keep the same, premium room with king bed facing the bay, so that worked out. Initially when my husband inquired they said they were going to make us move to a smoking room with a double bed but when we went together later they agreed to let us stay put. The bed was very comfortable and the room was fine. The bathroom was a bit odd, though. As others have stated, there are two open shuttered sections on the wall from the bathroom into the bedroom, so there is very little privacy. Also there were no towel racks in the bathroom which I found a bit odd. Other than that it was clean and the people were friendly. It's right at the entrance to Gaslamp Quarter, and a short walk to Seaport Village, so easy walking distance to restaurants and shops and the trolley. The restaurant (McCormicks's) was expensive but good. We had good meals at the Ole Madrid on 5th Avenue and Anthony's Fish Grotto along the waterfront. Also in Old Town La Pinata and Zocalo Grill were both good. Overall we loved San Diego. It was our first visit there. People were very friendly. We rented a car on the weekend and drove to La Jolla.

Nothing about this hotel--except a handful of helpful staff--really seemed up to the standards I've experienced elsewhere. THE ROOM Our Junior Suite was certainly large enough (520 sf), but it wasn't designed with travelers in mind; it's the equivalent of a hotel McMansion--space but no useability. Want to unpack for a few days? Good luck--no dressers, no drawers. Maybe just want to keep things in your luggage? No dice there either--no suitcase stand. We ended up stashing clothes on every available shelf including bedside tables and the TV stand. There's a huge bedroom, but no closet in it, and only one chair. So strange. The couch folds out into a bed, but in order to unfold it, you need to move an extremely heavy round glass table (I couldn't move it alone) and a side chair. Not a typical arrangement at all. The bathroom is enormous (with a good shower!), but almost unusable. The pedestal sink with tiny shelves (about 6\" x 4\", full of towels) mean there is nowhere to put a toiletry bag, makeup, etc. Also, no towel bar, and exactly one robe hook, located--I counted, eight steps--across the very large room from the shower and bath. So, I guess you should leave it in a heap on the floor? Who on earth designed this mess? THE HOTEL Attractive, modern lobby. Oddly laid out (are we sensing a theme here?) The concierge desk is waaaaaaaay over in the corner where you'd never find it without signs and directions. McCormick's and Schmick's restaurant is very good. Room service was great, fast, typically expensive. The menu seemed especially limited, though. THE SERVICE Uneven. Big compliments to the bell staff and the concierge. All were full of helpful suggestions and anticipated our needs. The front desk and housekeeping staff--not so much. Read on. . THE LITTLE PROBLEMS As a Select Guest, I've been treated very well at other Omnis. Here I was denied an upgrade (even though I had a valid voucher) because of availability, though the hotel was absolutely deserted for the time we were there (Jan 1-4, trust me, no one was in downtown San Diego the weekdays after a holiday). The OmniKids rolling backpack of activities never arrived. The bedtime milk and cookies arrived twice in one night, not at all another. Morning coffee/juice was twice left outside the door with no knock, so I eventually discovered the tray much later (and colder). Sometimes there was service for two, sometimes for three. Turndown time varied wildly from 5:30 to 9:00. At other hotels, they seem to aim for a more consistent (and convenient) 7-8 o'clock. We arranged for late checkout (rare rainy day in SD meant we had a few hours to kill and couldn't really walk around in the cold drizzle), but then had FOUR separate housekeeping staff knock on the door as we packed. None of these incidents, individually, was a Major Problem, but in aggregate they made for a stay that was consistently full of small annoyances and not what I expect from a purported five star hotel. Some dining suggestions--be advised it's far from the heart of the Gaslamp district and downtown. Nearby, eat at Mary Jane's Diner at the nearby Hard Rock (casual). Dussini Mediterranian Bistro a few blocks away was lovely for dinner (upscale). In sum: This hotel may be fine for game night or a convention, but don't go here with a family or for luxury. The suites are so poorly designed as to be a waste of the extra money--maybe the standard rooms are better. Other Omnis do a great job, but not this one. I trust Trip Advisor ratings, but in this case they're deceiving--Look hard at hotels that are more centrally located and more thoughtfully designed.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "pullthetab", "ReviewID": "UR12166411", "Content": "The Omni in San Diego was fantastic (unlike the Omni in Phila - old, dark and dusty).

I stayed here for 3 nights in November, 2007 and I'm writing this review from my room at the Omni on my last night here. The hotel is very nice. As was stated previously, the valet parking is extremely expensive---$28 per 24 hour period. But the valet parking garage is in the exact same building as the regular parking, and it's across the street. What does this mean? Simple---park the car yourself and save a ton of money! When I say \"across the street\", it's not a huge city street. The street is the size of a small alley, so the walk is very minimal. If you are made of money, sure, go ahead and use valet. But if you're like most people, just park the car yourself and walk 30 seconds to the hotel's front door. I only have two gripes, and both are very minor: 1) The staff doesn't seem to know much about the San Diego Trolley system (the Trolley is San Diego's light rail system). Also, the website for the San Diego Trolley is very poorly laid out and is confusing. For example, PETCO park is not listed on the Trolley maps, and the Omni is located next to PETCO park. Trying to figure out how to get from the hotel to ANYWHERE on the Trolley system is very confusing!!! I assumed the Omni staff downstairs at the front would be able to tell me about the Trolley system--ANYTHING about it---but they could not do this. Three front desk clerks, the gentleman who opens the front door, four Valet employees, and the Concierge..... none of these people were informed about the San Diego Trolley. Unbelievable. For those who are interested in the Trolley, the closest Trolley station to the Omni is the \"Gaslamp\" station. However, this Trolley does not run into Old Town--it requires a transfer. If you have no disabilities and are able to walk okay, all you do is walk out the front door of the hotel, turn right, walk to the right around PETCO park, and start looking for the big clock tower. At the foot of the clock tower is the Trolley station called \"12th and Imperial\". This is about a 7 minute walk, walking at a normal and comfortable speed. If you look at the San Diego Trolley website, this station looks very confusing. Why they make something simple look so complex is incredibly stupid. Even though it looks like two different stations at \"12th and Imperial\", there is only one station there. To get to Old Town, you get on a BLUE Trolley. It really is as simple as that. 2) The hotel did not honor my request for a non-connecting room. This is very minor, so I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I was actually upgraded to a \"junior suite\", but it was a connecting room. I actually would have preferred a normal room that did not connect. But they put me into room 1820 which was very nice, but I could also hear every sniffle, every sneeze, and every phone call of my neighbor in the next room. Why do hotels have SO MANY connecting rooms? Do people actually request this type of room on a regular basis? I don't know anyone who has ever requested such a room. As I said earlier, those two gripes are very minor and would absolutely NOT prevent me from staying here again. Everything here is wonderful. The turn-down service is wonderful also. In addition to turning down the bed, they turn on classical music, put mint-chocolates on the bed, and a card with hand-written information for tomorrow's forecast. If you are an Omni Select Guest member, they also put a door-card on your bed so that you can choose your morning beverages and newspaper (a free service). One small comment.....a lot of folks have made comments about the odd bathroom door and the shutters between the bathroom and the bedroom. I have to agree here. Although I am traveling alone on this trip, I think it would be weird to have more than one person in the room when using the bathroom. There is no \"sound-proofing\" at all. Closing the door is just to block the view---it does not block the sound at all. And as someone else noted in another review, there is no fan in the bathroom. So you can get a mental picture on your own---no sound blocking and no fan. What were the designers thinking?????? I am looking forward to my next trip to San Diego so that I can stay at this hotel again!

We spent $149-$199 per night. For this price, this hotel was above and beyond exceptional. We saw some of the comparable (but still higher) priced hotels in the area and are so glad we chose the Omni AT THIS RATE. Now, had we paid the normal $300-$500 rate, we might have been a little disappointed. Ok, starting from the beginning. The location of the hotel is great- a walk from downtown, but that's ok, as there are a multitude of bus/trolley stops near by. We had reserved a premium room with a view, and were told upon checkin that they gave those rooms to people who paid the full rate. I didn't really know what to say about that, but we were happy to be on the 6th floor, which is where the pool/deck and fitness area are. The room is super spacious- I mean, just loads of space to spread out. The bathroom is also big with ample space for all of your stuff. The only weird thing- no towel rack save for the one in the shower. The water is so strange- it 'jerks' a lot and the temperature really never got very hot. The room was spotless in terms of mildew, peeling paper, etc. Housekeeping was adequate. The room never felt quite clean during the entire stay, and we're not messy people, but stuff like mirror flecks, coffee cup rings, never got cleaned. The bed is so comfy, but this hotel is noisy. Period. Aside from the construction outside, there was constant noise in the hallways at any given time. Hammering, drilling, banging of doors, shouting. This alone makes me glad we didn't pay full price. The concierge and staff are all SO friendly and helpful. And we also noticed that everything is done, but in an understated way. We never once SAW housekeeping. Kind of cool. The pool/deck area is great- we made loads of use of it. Great hot tub, loads of towels and deck chairs and it felt warm on a breezy day. I'm convinced the entire deck is heated, not just the pool! But be aware, there is an event happening on the deck area once a day MINIMUM, so you will see a party going on at pretty much any given time. Feels kind of awkward, but hey, it's one of the reasons we chose this hotel. Also, the gym is sparse, but good. Brightly lit, very clean, and there's towels, headphones and fruit! The concierge urged us to do the overpriced trolley tour to get around the city and told us there is no other way to get around. Well, we're here to tell you that SD has a GREAT public transportation system. On Broadway and 1st, you'll find the Transportation Store, and they will help you do everything from tickets, to maps to itineraries.

We would question the value if we were paying the rates quoted on other web sites.

OK, my pet peeves--which applies not just to Omni, but incredibly to many upscale hotels: First, why do they short-sheet the beds? It's nice that the chains have invested in comfy pillow top mattresses, but they might consider buying sheets that are long enough to be tucked in at both the top and the bottom--maybe even fitted sheets. The Omni's bed was made better than some hotels since at least the sheet almost made it to the bottom of the mattress. Second, what is this love affair with comforters? Unless the room is nearly sub-zero, a comforter has only two settings: covered and too hot or uncovered and too cold.

Even with the windows closed (and we were on a very high floor) you could hear the noise of trolleys, construction, etc. So, that wasn't pleasant. However, that withstanding, the hotel is downtown, attached to the baseball stadium and directly in the heart of the restaurant and club district. Next to the convention center. Very easy to drive to all attractions. The parking was expensive (in my opinion it should be cheaper for what they charge you for the rooms.). The beds are AMAZING! It was hard to wake up because they are so comfortable. The staff was cordial, but not overly friendly. The hotel is clean and high tech.

The bathrooms were very large (could have used a bit more storage space but that is really being picky). The only issue we had was no dresser in our room - plenty of closet space and hangers and there were drawers in the night stands but with 3 people a dresser would have been nice - there was plenty of room for one.

And despite being a few years old now, the property looks and feels like new. The staff is helpful without being fake or pretentious. And the rooms are comfortable with excellent bedding and a low-key decor. The bathrooms are roomy and offer nice Omni-inspired toilettries. The hotel offers 24-hour room service, as well as a McCormick & Schmick's just off the lobby. And the location makes getting anywhere in downtown easy. The Omni is just off the Gaslamp without being right in the middle of it. One thing to be aware of (if you are staying on a Friday or Saturday night like I did) is that the hotel is near the Marriott Gaslamp, which offers a rooftop hotspot called Altitude. There is also a fish restaurant/bar next to the Omni. These two locales can be very loud and I needed to turn the fan on in the room to drown out the hip-hop music (and I was on the 16th floor). The music plays all hours and is disturbing to light sleepers. Also of note, is that the sliding door to the bathrooms at the Omni don't fit correctly and when shut offer people staying in the room a view into the bathroom. I was staying alone, but I can't imagine it would be very comfortable if you had a roommate and they could see what you were doing in the bathroom. I really enjoyed my stay here.

If you book a 4-Star Hotel in the Gaslamp through Hotwire, you more than likely will get the Omni at a highly discounted rate. Be nice and ask the front desk upon check-in for an upgraded or high level room, and they will most likely give you whatever is available.

I did go to a Padres game--it's very convenient because there's a skyway on the 4th floor of the hotel that leads directly into the park.

The room was nicely decorated, with attractive use of wood and modern furniture. The king-size bed was extremely comfortable; however, I felt the sheets could have been smoother. The flat-screen TV was great. I agree with other reviewers that the bathroom is different--the door closes by pulling two doors together (but no gap problems that I could see).

Amenities in the room are of excellent quality--especially loved the scented soap. One tip - I first thought there was no coffeemaker but then found it and coffee and tea supplies in a cabinet under the TV. I felt that the hotel doesn't have enough elevators--there was often a wait at busy times.

Unfortunately, my second time staying at this hotel was not so great. This past weekend, I stayed at the Omni for one night. The room and the service were great. Everything was in working order and prompt. There were two major problems happened during my stay except the following: The first problem was the noise issue. I had room 1601. It was one of those room that connects to the adjoining room. Nothing was wrong with that arrangement until two AM in the morning. There was a bunch of young women (think sority) talking and screaming loudly. It was as though they were in our room. I called the front desk (or the \"immediate service\" or something like that) but there was no answer. I came down to the front desk and explained to them the problem. They said they can send security up. I told them that would be a possible solution. However, I also told them that those women were talking loudly but it was in their room. I needed my sleep but at the same time, I felt that those women should be able to talk as it was \"their\" room. Instead, they gave us another room to sleep in without having to move my things. I thought that was a very nice gesture of them. The second problem had to do with the valet parking. The valet parking costed me 27 dollars per night with in and out previleges. There was no self parking. There was so much scratches and chipped paint damaged to my car. My car is relatively new. I knew that the scratch must have taken place during the my stay at the Omni because I had washed and waxed the car right before I left for San Diego. I did not use my car during my stay at the hotel. I called the manager and explained the situation. He was then informed me that the parking manager would call me. The parking manager called me two hours later and explained that they contract with Ace Parking. Furthermore, they will pay for the repair. The damage to my car was not that major. At the same, when you handed them your car, it is expected that they would take care of it. It just principle of things. If you need a place to stay in downtown San Diego, the Omni is a fine place. However, if you have a car, just be aware that they might damage your car.

After my stay, I'm not quite sure what all the raves are about. The Omni clearly aspires to be more than the solid middle-of-the-road convention hotel that it is, but misses many of the important details. First, the positives: staff were uniformly friendly and helpful; check-in was easy; and the building is beautiful. The room was pleasant enough (although the sheets were scratchy and the mattress was uncomfortable, and there were only two pillows on the bed). The gym facility was great. But helpful staff aside, the hotel -- at least during our stay -- missed some of the small details that better hotels wouldn't let slip by. Valet attendants, while friendly, didn't offer to help with luggage. Our room was missing a hotel information guide/room service menu. Our package rate was supposed to include the parking fee, but it appeared on the bill nonetheless, requiring a trip to the front desk to get it fixed. A note left on the bedside table promised that the bedside clock would change automatically to reflect the \"spring forward\" daylight savings time change; it did not. Individually, these small things weren't a big deal at all, but cumulatively, it seemed like the hotel didn't quite have its act together. And as noted by many reviewers here, the bathroom door design is just ridiculous -- there is literally a one-inch gap between the door and the wall, giving anyone sitting in the bedroom a clear view directly of the toilet. If you're not extremely comfortable with your traveling companion, this is not the hotel for you.

We were also able to walk to Balboa park and the zoo (which is spectacular and well worth a visit) - this took a bit longer (maybe 30-45 mins) however there is a tour bus which operates near to the hotel which does pick up/drop off along a lot of the tourist routes including the zoo. The Omni is also right next to a tram stop and the tram is a cheap way to get about (if you arrive in San Diego by train you get door to door service with the tram for $1.25! The only potential downsides for this hotel were as others have said. Firstly, I do think the design of the bathroom was a little odd with shuttered sliding doors which doesn't quite close fully. It wasn't a major issue but I think it's a little different! Also, noise is definitely an issue as the hotel is right next to a freight rail track with a road intersection and there was a lot of noise coming from trains during the night/early morning which did wake us (we were on the 12th floor).

My room had a view of the convention center and in the distance you could see the bay. My friend's room had a view of the bay and Petco Park. The room itself was nice (and small). None of us liked the bathroom door. It was a sliding door that did not give total privacy due to the sides of the door being always open and the door itself was mostly frosted glass. We complained that the room did not get nearly as cold as we wanted and we called 3 consecutive days until finally we found a note from maintenance on the 3rd day telling us that the air unit was working properly. We did not understand how we could set the air at 70 and it would only get as low as 74. The hallway felt like it was 65. Perhaps the sun in the windows kept the room too warm and the air just couldn't keep up. That was frustrating and uncomfortable as we like it cooler. We ordered breakfast for 2 the first morning. After taxes, numerous surcharges and tip = $75. I only ate half of mine as it was not very good. We didn't make that mistake twice. Valet parking is outrageously priced so we had to drive around the block, pay for parking and walk back to the hotel every day. That was annoying. A hotel of this class should have it's own garage.

We had tickets to the Padres game and the private entrance to the stadium on the 3rd floor was very nice. Would I stay here again? Only if my company paid the bill. There is no way that I would spend that much for a hotel like that. One restaurant, one bar, no entertainment and lots of extra costs. I have stayed in far better hotels for the price.

Firstly, I tried to get the speciaI rate $129.00 by booking online at their website with the special promo code, but when I entered the whole 4 nights of my stay it didn't show the $129.00 rate at all. Therefore...I then emailed Omni reservations direct and had a prompt reply from Joshua in Reservations, stating he could do the 1st three nights at $129.00 and the last night at $279.00. Which I was really happy with and when I replied to that email that the web booking didn't allow more than 1 night at the cheap rate, I was advised to email Reservations my credit card for booking confirmation and my booking would be processed. THEN I receive another email stating that he (Joshua) made a mistake and only the 1st night was at the $129.00 rate. The emails then went back and forth as I replied that he DID in fact quote me on the 3 nights and if it was a mistake, thought that the quoted price he supplied in his email to me should be honored by the Hotel. Next thing I get another email stating ALL the rooms within the special rate of $129.00 ARE SOLD OUT. But get this, I then immediately went back to their website to check, and there are STILL rooms available at $129.00 for the 5th April (which I think is when the special rate ends) I think the management don't want to honour the quoted price that Joshua made to me of $129.00 for 1st three nights ( 5 to 7th April and then 8th April @ $279.00) Very dissapointed with MANAGEMENTS decision, as I do have the emails from Joshua quoting the special price for the first 3 nights of $129.00 my 4 night intended stay in a Premium room with Bay view & 2 x double beds increasing to $279.00 for the 4th night (staying in the same room) Thats my winge about this hotel Hotel may be in good location etc but when it comes to honouring their quoted prices their service is at rock bottom.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in a crowded cityscape.\u201d", "Author": "mothnm", "ReviewID": "UR5924406", "Content": "Arrived at night.

The location cant be beat, downtown is a mix of the old, charming and eclectic with a lovely view of the water. Stores and restaurants are abundant and within a quick walk. Highlights: The pool area is warm and inviting with music that plays undewater-my son got a kick out of that. and yes, the hotel is kid friendly. The service seemed to be on par and not overly patronizing in that phony way one sometimes finds in hotels. There is the now-requisite outdoor fireplace that all west coast properties seem to have these days but it is mainly for display as no real heat was generating from it but who needed it this time of year anyways?? We got tickets to a Padre's game and Petco Park is worth seeing even if you arent catching a game. We were, and really enjoyed the skywalk which takes you directly to the park from the hotel. All you need is a room key to enter. For baseball fans, this may be \"the place to stay\" in San Diego. As for the room, well I am not one to nitpick a very nice place, which the Omni certainly is but I have to say that the bathroom door which in our room was part clouded glass, while visually pleasing from a decorative standpoint, did not lend itself to alot of privacy nor was there a fan in the bathroom. Now, being married for twelve years, I can say that wasnt really an issue, it still wasnt practical and I can imagine that some couples might find the design uncomfortable for their stay. In addition, the coffee maker had to be taken out of the wall console and plugged in at the desk where my laptop was situated. Again, not a huge deal but an inconveninece none the less. And since the tv/stereo had electrical hookup, a little forethought, could have remedied this design flaw. The conference rooms were quite adequate. I believe the service was good as well and the temperature was not below freezing as is the case with many hotel meeting rooms. As for food service, the meals at the conference were quite nice and above the average that I have had. We did not eat in the hotel restaurants due to a plethora of places in the surrounding area. But I did see the buffet for breakfast at McCormick and Schmicks and it did look enticing and a good value. Conceierge was busy but helpful. Bonus: they comped us the foldout bed for my son which was suppose to be an additional 25 a night. We had signed up for their special guest program prior to arriving and that may have been why, In any event, that goes along way in my book to building good will and customer loyalty.

The Omni is situated downtown on the bay; a short walk away from the historic Gaslamp Quarters which we walked to daily for dining, drinking, and shopping. The hotel is connected by skybridge to the incredible new Petco Park where we saw the San Diego Padres play. New convention center is right next door. Beaches, shopping and site seeing is only a short drive away as well. 2) Great value. After staying at the Hotel del Coronado three nights previous, it was refreshing to enjoy nicer amenities at a less expensive nightly rate. This new facility has beautiful rooms and common areas with very nice finishes (tile, fixtures, carpet etc.). Those who appreciate clean lines and modern design without sacrificing comfort will feel right at home (see pics). The rooftop (6th floor) pool is heated saltwater which is wonderful on a chilly San Diego evening and has a bar (although it\u2019s not open very late). Wireless internet is free (included in nightly rate). 3) Staff was very friendly. After noticing a comment on our reservation from our AAA agent that it was our honeymoon, they automatically upgraded our room free of charge. 4) We had a nice sense of privacy compared to our experience at Hotel del Coronado. Noise was not a problem at any time during our stay. 5) Fun for kids. Even though we are newly weds without children, our upgraded \u201cjunior suite\u201d had the \u201cOmni Kids\u201d room attached. This room had bunk beds, giant stuffed animals, books, games, bean bags, and a separate TV. I can imagine that kids would have a tough time leaving this hotel as it definitely looked like a lot of fun (see pics). CONS: 1) Pool area closes at 10:00PM and the poolside bar usually closes at 7:00PM. Not a big deal at all but we feel this was a little early for such a nice amenity. 2) Valet parking is $24 per night. A little tip: To save some money, self park in the new garage right across the street. Our nightly rate there was only $8 as we only used the car once a day (no in and out privileges).

There is a small sign posted indicating this. Due to the small entrance area, it may not be visible to all. In todays day and age, this is to be expected, especially from a downtown location. Check in was painless and quick. The issue arose around connecting rooms which I had requested via the company website at time of booking. By the way, I tried to book this hotel at almost every travel web site known to man with no success. Went to the hotel site at the 11th hour and was successful. We were traveling with four children and it was a must to ahve connecting rooms. After what looked like a potential glitch, the front desk manager, came over and handled it, no questions asked. He even upgraded us to the bay view side of the tower and did it with a smile. The location of the hotel was great. 10 minutes to Sea World, a few to the San Diego Embarcadero, Zoo and Balboa park. Not far from anywhere. Definitely nothing closer to Petco Park than the Omni if you care to catch a ballgame. They are connected via a walking bridge. You are at the south end of the city's Gaslamp district where there are many restaurants and bars, if you like. The area was very crowded, but clean. The hotel pool is small and the kids let me know it. However, the staff and the surrounding pool grounds were immaculate. Great service. Not a true test as there were only about 10 people in the pool area. Never the less, a great time. We had breakfast at the buufet at McCormick & Schmicks which is located inside the hotel. Not too expensive, but be wary about the drinks. Caveat Emptor, $45 dollars of fresh squeezed orange juice, for 10 servings. Wonder how many oranges we could have bought back home for that amount ?

But the real problem was in how they handled the second problem. The night before I was to check out (at 6 am to catch a flight), I called and asked for a wake up call. Someone answered the phone and confirmed the time that I would be given a call. The alarm clocks in the room give you the option of either radio, CD, or natural sounds (who wakes up to the sound of the ocean??), but no buzzer. So I was counting on that wakeup call. I didn't get it and ended up missing my flight as a result. When I went down to check out at a little before 8am, the manager on duty confirmed that I didn't get a call and apologized. He put me in a cab to the airport at the hotel's expense, so I was happy about that. The strange thing though was that he wanted me to leave my bags at the hotel. I asked why and his explanation was that they would be there in case I couldn't get on a standby flight. I asked what if I do get on standby, what happens to my bags? He said they would drive them over. Apparently the manager has never flown on an airplane because that makes no sense. By the time you get confirmed for standby, there isn't time for bags to be shuttled to the airport, come back outside security to get them, go back inside, etc. etc. Anyway, aside from the bizarre recomendation to leave my bags, I was still happy that they did whatever was necessary to get me to the airport ASAP. My real beef is the next thing that happened... When I got back to Dallas, I saw a huge second charge on my credit card, to the tune of about $150. I called to ask what it was and left several messages that were never returned until days later. While waiting for the callback, I called again and asked to speak to the hotel desk to see if someone could tell me what the charge was for. I finally spoke with the manager on duty and he researched and told me that it was from the mini-bar. I said, \"WHAT?? I never even opened the mini-bar, I certainly didn't take or consume anything from it.\" The manager then began to argue with me over the charges, as if I was a liar and thief. He was unbelievably rude. I spent a huge amount of money to stay at the hotel, they then tack on some other wrong charges, and *I'm* the one who is being given the second degree?? He starts listing the timeline, \"Our records show you checked out at 1:30pm, we checked the mini-bar at 2:00pm....\" etc. I say, hold on, you don't even have these times right. I checked out at about 8:00am, and I can prove that I was in another city eating lunch at the time you have me checked out. He goes on to say that's all irrelevant, the charges are still correct [because his computer tells him so]. I said, no, your records are demonstrably incorrect on many aspects, you can't tell me that despite all the other errors, you are certain that the charge is correct--someone obviously inputted someone else's data to my name or room or whatever. He continued to argue with me and that's when I lost it. I finally told him that they either fix the charges or I'm disputing them with my credit card company, I took nothing, and I refuse to pay for something I didn't take. He finally said in a huff that they would remove the charges, but there was no apology, no acknowledgement that the mistake might have been theirs. There was never an offer to look into it or investigate, etc. He was only doing it because I refused to pay it, as if I was just some scummy person trying to get away with something. I refuse to let some manager impugn my character when the mistake was the hotel's. I've left a message with the general manager about the manager's terrible attitude and haven't yet gotten a callback. For a hotel that prides itself on award winning customer service and quality, it is outrageous that they treat guests like criminals when the hotel has made a mistake.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cNice and clean\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5363401", "Content": "Nice Hotel, I suggest that you become a Select member.

It sits beside the Hilton and adjacent to the in-construction Hard Rock Hotel. It is connected to the San Diego Padres' stadium Petco Park via a 5th floor Skywalk which takes you directly to the stadium. The Omni actually has ballpark view which allow you to see into the stadium. That's pretty neat. Definitely the place to stay if you're going to see a Padres game. There are actually about 5 tables with seats on the 6th floor that allow you to do work and look into the stadium. The 6th floor also has a decent and quiet seating area to do some work (across from the fitness center). Pool is nice, a bit small for the size of the hotel, but heated. There is also a nice little hot tub. Not a big pool area though, compared to the Hyatt Manchester Grand down the road. Hotel is very clean and has a nice, modern look. It looks brand new actually. Rooms are nice and are cleaned efficiently and quickly. Turndown service with some chocolates at night are nice (for Omni Select Guests). Select Guests also receive free coffee or orange/grapefruit juice in the morning along with their choice of newspaper. It's delivered right to the door. A nice touch. My family had a bay view on the 19th floor with excellent views of Coronado Bridge, Coronado Island, Point Loma, and down Harbor Drive (where you can see past the Marriott, Hyatt, and to the Embassy Suites. Very pleased with my stay. Staff is nice and courteous. Complaints: What is the deal with the bathroom door? There is a sliding door with a frosted plexiglass window separating the bathroom from the bedroom. A silhouette is clearly seen through the door. There are even cracks in the side so anyone walking by can see. The Omni might has well have hanged a sheet or piece of plastic in between the bathroom and bedroom. It was so annoying. There is a complete lack of privacy and you have to essentially tell people not to get near the bathroom when you are in there. Bathroom is nice, with nice shelving, but the door needs to go! Also, the $24/night valet parking is outrageous. The valet guys are annoying as well and aren't very efficient. I would prefer a lot to park in where I could come and go as I please. Also, due to the location being in downtown, and there is a lot of construction all over downtown, there can be banging throughout the day. Also, while being beside the train tracks is nice because of trolley service, there are also freight trains that use that tracks (mostly at night) and you can expect to hear train horns and whistles a couple of times an hour throughout the night.", "Date": "June 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGood time!\u201d", "Author": "superez", "ReviewID": "UR5064297", "Content": "My boyfriend and I spent Cinco de Mayo weekend at the Omni San Diego and had a marvelous time! The location of the hotel is hard to beat...adjacent to the Gaslamp District, steps away from the trolley and connected by pedestrian bridge to Petco Park. That was a plus...it took us 5 mins to get from our room to our seats! All of the Omni staff we came in contact with were incredibly cordial and helpful. We decided to do the $24/day valet parking after all, just because of the convenience and the in/out privledges (even though we didn't even need the car the whole weekend!). They do park the car in the same lot as the $9/day self park lot across the street, but I didn't mind paying extra for the convenience. Upon check-in we were given a 20% off coupon for the McCormick and Schmicks restaurant in the lobby...quite a good deal!! The food was good and actually, even if you are not staying at the hotel and eat there, you can use the convenient pedestrian bridge to Petco Park. We reserved a King room. The room was not super large but definitely fine and cozy for 2 people. It was a busy weekend so unfortunately we couldn't get an ocean view room and instead got a view of the city. There is quite a lot of construction going on so we did hear some of that on Fri and Sat, but the windows are pretty thick so it wasn't too bad nor an issue for us. The bed was extremely comfy, and the bathroom was huge considering the overall size of the room. We didn't have those wierd slats like others have complained about (between the bedroom and bath) but I must agree the hotel walls are quite thin. This only bugged me the first night..unfortunately I could hear the couple next door having a \"good time.\" But, earplugs were the easy solution and I slept like a baby. There were no noise issues for us the second night at all. Unfortunately the bathroom doesn't have a fan, we thought that was a little strange. But we did like the fact that you can open the bedroom windows. We used the gym both days and really liked the setup. The orange water, apples/oranges, towels and spotless facility were definite plusses. The pool area looked really nice, but we didn't use it due to the cool and gloomy weather that weekend. Do register for the Omni's Select Guest Program....the room was set up to our specs (extra towels, turndown service, get fit kit) and we really enjoy the complimentary morning beverage service. The other great advantage is late check out! We left by 230 but Select Guests can stay as late as 5pm. All in all our stay at the Omni San Diego was great.

The valet seemed \"disappointed' when I mentioned we would be self-parking across the street... great tip TripAdvisor members, thanks! We did not have a view of the water or ballpark but the bellman did arrange for us to be moved to a higher floor so we were not looking directly into the parking structure.

Joining the Omni Select Guest program expedites reservations, preferences and the morning beverages and paper (delivered to your door). There is a coffeemaker in the room but take advantage of the SG free additional beverages of choice. You can also add on a muffin or bagel for a couple of bucks a piece. Most places charge more than twice that amount. If you appreciate quality amenities and attention to detail, the Omni does not disappoint. Now on to the question of the bathroom \"door\". Our bathroom had a frosted- glass wood framed \"door\" that rolls on a suspended track rather than being attached with hinges. And yes, therefore, there is not a sealed door but... the spaciousness of the bathroom, huge tub/shower with great water pressure , quality towels and amenities more than makes up for the unusual door.

I am a Omni SelectGuest Club member, which was helpful as your room requests are granted first, and free morning beverages/newspaper are delivered to your door every day. The room was spacious with truly great views as we had hoped. The only negative was that train tracks run right along the Omni, and there is construction going on to the East/Southeast of the hotel, so loud train whistles can be heard occasionally once or twice at any hour of the night, with heavy machinery piledrivers occasionally in the morning, though it did not bother me much as I am a heavy sleeper. Also, it should be noted that trains run across the length of Harbor Drive where several upscale hotels are located. The bathrooms did take a bit of getting used to, though they afforded enough privacy as long as no mischevious people try to open the wooden blinds while you are using the restroom (Perhaps small children would not do the best in this situation). Also, there was no fan in the bathrooms, which was slightly disturbing. The amenities were everything we have come to expect from the Omni, with wonderful chairs/desks, comfortable beds/pillows, and a large plasma flat screen TV in our room. The maid/housekkeping services were great, and cleaned up the large messes we left every morning in an appreciated manner. The valet services were great, and we used them primarily as we came and went several times a day, and it was much easier and cheaper than parking on our own. The area was wonderful with great shopping and restaurants around as well. When it came time for checkout we were a little late for our flight, so the express check-out was greatly appreciated.

For example, on two of the three nights we did not get a turndown service despite requesting it in advance. Daily maid service was slow, on both days our request for an early maid service were ignored and we returned in the early afternoon to find the room as we had left it.

Nice, if small bathroom (lack of privacy notwithstanding). The shower and bath are not seperate and the bath is actually very small. The big problem with the bedrooms is the lack of noise insulation - from the exterior and other rooms. A 'hard rock hotel' is being constructed next door and that can be very distracting.

Someone taking a shower awoke my wife on one morning. This is not what one would expect from an Omni - more like a motel!

No parking hassles, no $24/day valet expense, no getting lost, and no dealing with parking on the other end. Here are some of the things we did, very easily, using the busses and trolleys: San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park (#7 bus) The Beaches (#34 bus) Fashion Valley/Qualcom Stadium (for a football game) (Trolley) Midway Aircraft Carrier Museum (Trolley) Old Town (Trolley) Sea World (Trolley to Old Town, #9 bus) Petco Park Tour (Walked) All of this info is very easily available on the sdcommute website. I\u2019ll admit, riding the bus with the mass-transit crowd certainly takes away from the feeling of staying in a four-star hotel, but it was nice not to have to deal with a car for a few days.

I chose the property based on 2 reasons: great Expedia flight and hotel package (which gave me $1,400 in savings) and of course, reviews from Tripadvisor. We stayed in room 1733 : corner room on the 17/f, 2 double beds, with a great view of the Petco Park next door. We were very thankful that the Omni had accommodated these requests -- and were even able to check in as early as 7:30 am, as we took the first flight out of San Francisco. The room was simply elegant and modern. From the cool alarm clock that my daughter was itching to play with, to the funky sliding bathroom door which did not pose a problem to us. In fact, my daughter had a blast peeking through that 1 inch gap whenever me or my husband would be in the bathroom! While I loved the plentiful shelves in the bathroom, my husband was impressed with the nice balcony (not an open one) that you can just gaze out endlessly to the game next door. Again, this is while my kid goes on and off the weighing scale in the bathroom, which is also a nice touch. Housekeeping did an excellent job in maintaining our rooms spotless throughout our stay. Room always smelled fresh and new, and even in the hallways as you come out from the elevator. Equally good was the turndown service that you get every night -- mint chocolates with next day's weather forecast on your pillow, dimmed lights, plus a soothing Omni channel on the TV that plays as you enter your room at night. The doormen in the morning and evening (Dave and Anthony, respectively) were very friendly and would always ask us where we are going for the day or where we have been. The valet guys (though we only used the service for a night) also had smiles for us whenever we come back to the hotel. Concierge, as expected, was courteous and knowledgeable with just about everything we needed to know about the area. The Front Desk were all very pleasant. I was surprised though at check-in that I was not asked for identification when i registered. Being a Front Desk agent myself, I found that kinda strange since my reservation has already been prepaid. Oh well,... =) My 2 complaints -- which are not much: 1. we were not able to get our complimentary morning beverage as shared by other TA reviewers. Though I signed up for the Select Guest membership prior to my stay, I was informed by the Front Desk that I need to have stayed previously in an Omni property to enjoy that particular service. Funny, but we got the other amenities/service (late checkout, morning paper, turndown service) that came along with the Select Guest membership. 2. fee to rent a fridge is $25/night. since we were staying for 8 nights, i don't think i can afford to pay $200 just to keep my daughter's milk from going stale. so we just made do of the ice bucket to serve that purpose. Overall, the hotel was an excellent base for our sightseeing activities in San Diego. Initially, we thought we were out of place seeing all the convention people staying in the hotel!

At the Omni San Diego during our three-day stay last week in a one-bedroom suite, the problem was more than attention to detail: even attention to the basics was lacking. We will definitely NOT stay there again. We had problems small and large, spanning all hotel departments. From housekeeping: sloppy bedmaking, neglected towel supplies, previous-night room service items left where they stood, ignored requests for extra items or turndown service (although they certainly found the tips the requests were attached to!). From the dining room: paltry service and a dead-slow kitchen. From maintenance: ignored repair requests for a broken A/C, multiple burned-out lights, and a jammed bathroom door. From the switchboard: repeated notices over two days for a message I'd long since picked up. On our last evening there, I had a long, detailed conversation with the manager on duty about the problems we were having; she expressed her apologies and her assurance that the rest of our stay would be up to standard. Sure enough, within minutes, both maintenance and housekeeping were working over our room, setting it right. But half-an-hour later, I called room service requesting iced wine bucket service for a bottle of wine we had brought; no doubt anxious to impress, it was a manager who ran up the wine bucket to our room in short order- but without wine glasses. My wife and I drank our chilled wine out of bathroom glasses. The next morning, we walked out of the hotel restaurant without ever receiving the breakfast we had paid for. We placed our order and waited... and waited... until 23 minutes after ordering, when our server informed us that they were out of an item we had ordered, and would we please reorder (which we did). A few minutes later, when I asked her how long until we would have our meal, she said she couldn't say, because they were \"really busy.\" (Actually, they weren't- and most of the patrons there were having buffet, not menu service.) That said, I have to give kudos to their concierge department, which was as knowledgeable, professional, and capable as we have ever come across. If the Omni San Diego overall had been up to the standard of their concierge desk, our stay would have been a true delight instead of the deep disappointment it proved to be.", "Date": "August 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cDidn't want to leave the Omni!\u201d", "Author": "lunchtime", "ReviewID": "UR3763202", "Content": "We just returned from spending three nights at the Omni and we are still talking about how wonderful everything was!

The food in the hotel's restaurant, McCormick & Schmick's, was only mediocre and the service was a little slow. I've been to other M&S locations where the food and service was much better. Also, the hotel claims to have 24-hour room service.

The border took 30 minutes for a small $ 3.00 all-day fare. The Omni sits at the mouth of the Gaslamp district, so all of your nightlife and dining spots are easily walked to. Seaport Village is also a walkable distance as is the convention center and Horton Plaza for shopping. A $ 10 cab ride will take you to the Maritime Museum with the U.S.S. Midway and Star Of India as well as a cool Russian Submarine. The ONLY and somewhat major annoyance for me was the NOISE from the streets outside the hotel. I had read about this from reviews and specifically asked to be placed on a higher-up floor. Even up on the 12th floor I was STILL awakened each morning by garbage trucks, trains and police sirens. Very aggravating. They should find a better time schedule to get their trash collected. You do NOT need a rental car and be warned the valet charges are quite expensive at the Omni.
