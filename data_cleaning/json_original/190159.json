However it does lack facilities. Even though the website says it has a gym / fitness area this is an extremely small area in the roof, the windows are all fogged up. Can't do a decent work out. Breakfast is generous. The hotel decor is dated, from the late 80s in brown everything. I did have a massive room thanks to an upgrade. Only major down side was the late night door men have a bit of a pompous / judgemental attitude. Just because I'm not old and wrinkled and with a woman on my arm doesn't mean I can't stay at a hotel.

Overall a very good hotel, very central, and easily accessible to the Metro. Staff pleasant and helpful. Rooms slightly above average and reasonable. breakfast was good and will set you up for the day, Getting there As it is a 2 min walk to hotel, we took the metro, taxi would run you about 30 euros or more, hotel has a shuttle for 13 eur per person, and do drop offs to airport, did not check if they arrange collections. I would recommend the shuttle or taxi if you have a lot of luggage, we had one piece of carry on each and a bag, so we took the metro. The cost is 4.50 (1.50 plus 3Eur supplement). On arrival to airport, follow the signs within the airport, its about a 5-7 min walk from our arrival point taking a right and following signs. Take the number 8 line to Nuevos Ministerios, transfer to grey line one stop to Cuatros Caminos, and then transfer to red line for opera, overall took about 50 minutes from airport to hotel. On arrival at airport walk up exit with the opera house facing you, it is on the right hand corner, you cannot miss it. The location is very central, but we still purchased a travel 10 ticket in the airport for trips to Bernabeu and the Park, and more than person can use it, just put ticket in the machine, walk through, then hand it back and the next person can use it, this is perfectly normal and allowed. the airport trips will take up 4 anyway, don't forget you will need an airport supplement ticket on way back, which you can buy at departure point or at the airport. The hotel Check in was a breeze and we checked in just after 11am and got a room, so we could start touring straightaway. Hotel is 3-4 minutes to Plaza Oriente, Palacio Real, 10 minutes or less to Plaza Major and Mercado de san Miguel (which you have to try). Free Wifi but you will need a code for each device, I took one but could only use on iPad and not on smartphone, they will give you a second no problem. Hotel also has 2 communal computers for use should you need them, email check in online etc... Room was pleasant if not overly large, plenty of closet space for a couple, bathroom was large in comparison to room, and pleasant, showers powerful. Only downside was some slight noise from street at night time, but nothing that kept us awake, light sleepers might want ear buds, but it was low level. Beds were singles pushed together and made separately which was fine for us considering the wife does a World In Action when sleeping in hot countries. Aircon worked fine. Flatscreen TV but never used it, too much nightlife! Toiletries in bathroom. Staff were very pleasant, and always wanted to help. Breakfast was selection of fruits, ham, salamis, cheese, cereals, fresh juices, coffee and eggs scramlbed and boiled with bacon sausage or mushroom, and plenty of cakes, croissant etc..Very pleasantly surprised at selection, only downside was if a lot of people arrive at the same time, plates glasses etc.. can be scarce, no big deal for us, as it only lasted for about 15 minutes and was then resolved, I think I heard a comment of staff arriving late or absent for morning shift. Enjoyable trip, very central and would stay here again. Tips - You have to try the Mercado de san Miguel, for a bite to eat, beside the Plaza Major. You can get negotiate on paintings in the Plaza Mayor on Sundays, we managed to get a decent painting and knocked 20% off the price, could have gotten more I think but, it was great value for the price purchased, we used Aer Lingus and not the nazis in Ryanair, so was easily transported back home. Tried Sobitin, nice to do as oldest restaurant in the world, but quality of food can be easily beaten elsewhere, and cheaper too.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jerusalem, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGood location , good service !\u201d", "Author": "Haifa-LHP", "ReviewID": "UR131477360", "Content": "Very close to the Opera House and the metro is just around the corner.

We book-ended 10 days in Spain with 2 nights at Hotel Opera on arrival and 1 night on departure. The things I had liked about the Hotel in 2011 remained: great location, sound night sleep, clean (see smoking note below) and well-appointed in a basic \"IKEA\" manner, helpful staff, and broad breakfast buffet. What really pleased me is that the restaurant has changed its menu (and perhaps its chef?) and was very nice indeed. Not high end, mind you, but for tapas and light sandwiches, it really filled the bill. One of my traveling partners this trip has issues with mobility (knees), diet (no seafood), sensitivity to fragrance, and a large build. I confess that we found the single room too small for her to negotiate easily and even the double room a bit difficult. This was a matter of both space around the beds and the layout of the bathroom. Our second room had a walk-in shower which was much easier than the tub-shower of the previous room, but the door to the bathroom of the second was much narrower than that of the first room. You should know that there seems to be wide difference in the size and shape of the double and single rooms n different parts of the Hotel -- some designs are efficient and well-thought-out, others are not so. Elevators and ramps made getting around the Hotel easy for her, but the chairs in the Breakfast Buffet were uncomfortably narrow for her. The buffet breakfast is, in my opinion, very nice. I enjoy the local flavour of the offerings: jamon, cheeses, fruit, pastry, coffee, and beautiful, fresh OJ. My traveling companions -- who prefer North American breakfast -- had more difficulty with the selections as they found the eggs, bacon, sausage to be undercooked for their taste. As a last cautionary word, despite being a non-smoking hotel, one of our rooms had clearly been smoked in. We chose to not say something until check-out, and the one of us who stayed in that room still got a good night's sleep. The front desk staff was very gracious when we mentioned it to them, and I certainly had the sense that had we needed to make a change, then that would have been accommodated. The staff at the front desk was exceptional. When some of our travel documents failed to arrive at the Hotel from the travel agent, the staff was very helpful with getting these to our room right upon arrival, and they were very good at helping connect us by phone with our travel agents both in Spain and in North America. When one of the drivers needed to make a change in departure time, the staff even helped the driver track us down in their restaurant. Hats off to the staff!

The staff was very helpful and easy going, the room clean and well-equipped (although not as quiet room-to-room as it might have been), and the location beautifully central. We found it very easy to put down our bags and within a matter of 30 minutes by foot be at the Prado with energy for the museum to spare. On subsequent days we found ourselves just steps from the Palace Royal, the main pedestrian area near Puerta del Sol, the Plaza Mayor, the subway, and even the funky Egyptian Temple (a GREAT sunset venue!). We found the beds to be comfortable and the breakfast to be excellent, although the breakfast selection seemed to diminish with later seatings. This hotel was the only time we were in Spain that we turned on the TV, and that only to watch the coverage of the Formula 1 GP qualifying and race that Saturday and Sunday morning, but we did find that English channels or even English subtitles were not an option. This may be typical for Spain, but I mention it here in case you know or suspect it to be otherwise. The major drawback to the hotel may have more to do with evening meal times in Spain than the hotel itself, but even being there on that major pedestrian area, it was impossible to get even basic tapas before 8:30 in the evening except at the hotel -- not even a small market or easy deli close at hand. On the first night we hunted around everything that looked plausible and were turned away from a number of establishments because the kitchen was still closed: starving at 8:45 we opted for the only restaurant open and it was sorely lacking. The second night we walked to Plaza Mayor and were able to eat at 8:00 and could have picked up something at the nearby \"market\" earlier if need be. The last night, we just lumped into the Hotel restaurant because the weather had turned and we had been to Segovia and we had a morning flight -- but honestly, the dinner menu looked very creative, but the quality of the food was marginal. Scheduling an airport shuttle through the hotel worked, but they had us in a bit of a panic because we couldn't make the request until 24-hours before the call-time of the shuttle, and it was less than 12 hours before the pick-up time before the Hotel could confirm we could get the shuttle at all, and in the end the shuttle was more than 30 minutes late arriving. You might be best off making your own plans for airport transfers. Oh, and lastly, the glass walled bathrooms -- while beautiful -- meant that a light in the bathroom at night meant that the whole room became lit. So all and all, the sleeping and room part of the hotel was very good, the breakfast was great, but be ready to have to go very-off-site for an evening meal (and be ready for it to be a very late meal at that!)", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cVery good, contemporary hotel, great location and friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "Anna D", "ReviewID": "UR119312134", "Content": "We loved our contemporary room.

The breakfast was nice -a selection of pastries, fruit, bacon and sausage toast etc. Our only complaint was that the breakfast room was small and so got overcrowded. The staff were extremely helpful and spoke english very well. Beware of the cafe inside though as they are strictly Spanish speakers and didn't have a clue what we were talking about -it was extremely frustrating!!! My boyfriend and I saw many sights while in Madrid. If you're going the bus tour is a must, as is a visit to the Bernabau (I don't even like soccer and I still found it amazing!) Also if you find you have a day to spare a trip to Camp de Casso is extremely worthwhile. It's a large park with an amazing zoo, aquarium and theme park and you get to see the animals close up. In conclusion if I were to visit Madrid again I would probably stay somewhere in Grande Via (as all the shops and pubs are there) Hotel Opera is a nice clean hotel with great staff.

Actually this hotel was my second choice (dad let me do planning--Pooh was unable to go so Dad subbed :) as I first attempted Hotel Meninas (one street over) and when the website said it didn't have the availability I need it recommended its 'sister' property. Took trains from Barajas and it was really easy--took about 35-45 minutes--even if the walk at the airport and the second station (Nuevo Ministerios) were fairly lengthy. The same cannot be said from the 2 Train Opera stop: pic out the window accompanying review shows distance to plaza where stop it--maybe, MAYBE 200 yds all on sidewalk. One ancillary note to address common complaint: our room was right above the noise and construction, but the hotel cant really do anything about that: the entire subway plaza and what appeared to be a taxi turnaround on the side of the Opera House were both under construction--I'd be surprised if there were not finished or nearly so. I don't buy the manager's responses about 'were downtown so it's loud' as it was the construction--in the absence of that even on the second floor it was generally quiet--maybe some advisory on the website regarding the construction progress would help alleviate complaints and apologies. On the way out, took a joint use van to airport that was around 10-12Euro a person but only took about 20-25 minutes underway and not nearly as much trying to 'figure out' where to go next--didn't see that on website on way in, just posted on front desk for way out. As you can see, we stayed in a two twin bed room and it was located on the second floor--I usually took stairs and dad the elevator. Lights in halls are cool as they're motion sensor and come on as needed. No problem checking in even with a slight language barrier--my Spanish was almost on par with the staff English but the reservation number and the AMEX did most of the heavy work. Rooms are pretty small but like most other trips we don't spend much time there save sleeping. If you're a TV junkie, hope you speak Spanish--only Bloomberg Business was in English. If you're looking to catch-up via the internet, at least where we were on second floor wifi in room was weak at best but in lobby much better--they have two computers as well for general use. Lots more 'suits' at this hotel so probably caters as much to business travelers as slackers like me (and Pooh and Dad). Beds and pillows extremely comfy and nice safe in room for passport/computer/extra $$ and whatnot...not much going on on the desk but good place just to empty pockets. Bathroom was actually big compared to size of room and shower never failed for hot water; a little moldy in the crevices but nothing I couldn't handle. Breakfast was excellent a cross-between American and Continental European (what I assumed was more Spanish breakfasty) item, but all fresh (except fruit salad) and a lot of it--no fridge in room to squirrel away stuff for later though [given late dinners the Kid needs grub]. I can't vouch for the adjoining restaurant though it seemed fairly busy: with Gran Via and Calle de Arenal both at your doorstep, you'll have plenty of eating/drinking options if you time them right. There appeared to be a bar up on the mid-level of the first floor but I never once saw any movement in there (even as late as 8-9pm) save people waltzing back and forth to computers. Was a bit rainy when there but mass transit (buy the Tourist Travel pass at airport; http://www.crtm.es/servlet/CambiarIdioma?xh_TIPO=8) and lots of indoor stuff makes passing time easy. Already mentioned Metro stop as being really close (and right across the street from McDonalds--free Wifi BTW but they're not open for breakfast at all...open about 11 I think). The Theater/Opera, Grand Palace, Asian/Oriental Gardens (beware of solicitations for massages), Plaza Mayor, Puerta del Sol (another train stop too), Gran Via and other notables are all less than 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Trains and busses made getting to Prado, Naval Museum, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and Atocha Station all no brainers. You could really walk to Prado in about 1/2 hr if you wanted. Within walking distance, we also made our way to Plaza de Espana for the Segway tour of another part of city. Definitely do not need a car and in summer wonder if you'd even need transit pass--though you'd be wise to bring your Rough Guides phrase book...lot fewer English speakers here than in Amsterdam (previous review).", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Deanio79", "ReviewID": "UR96913185", "Content": "Just got back from a 3 night stay in the Opera Hotel in Madrid.

When we returned to complain to Hotel Opera, the truth came out. Apparently there had been an influx of athletes--instead of the 24 they were expecting, they had a group of over 30, so we got bumped. (I suspect they were able to charge the additional athletes more due to the increase in demand. They also had a Rick Steves tour there, so they certainly weren't going to bump any of them.) When we did move into the hotel for the last two nights, we were given a room on the top floor, overlooking the street and nearby plaza where construction was going on until the very early hours of the morning, so it was almost impossible to sleep the first night. Other people on our floor had rooms on the opposite side and were not bothered by noise. The only good thing about the hotel was the breakfast buffet. Because we complained vigorously about being bumped, we were given one night without charge, but since we were charged twice what Hotel Principe Pio normally charges, it was a wash.

We've required the quite room on the upper floor upon arrival with the windows facing the court yard. And we actually got such room. BUT!!! The room feels and looks like a small cage (weirdly remodeled part of the attic) squeezed right between the two extremely noisy facilities - elevator and Gym. What an interesting interpretation of the 'quiet' room by the hotel management! Of course we asked if there is anything else available and being offered either non-smoking room on the first floor or a room on the 4th floor in a smoking area (both facing the busy street). We choose a horribly smelled room on the 4th floor in a smoking area to be as much far from the street noise as possible. But it didn't help actually. The whole area in front of the Opera House (where hotel is located) is a construction zone now. The workers start drilling the asphalt at 6 a.m. every single day. But if you think you can sleep quietly until that time you are wrong. Between 2 a.m and 4 a.m. the garbage tracks starting their noisy business picking up the huge garbage cans placed right in front of the hotel. I understand that ongoing construction work and garbage tracks are out of the control of the hotel management but putting all things together from our point of view the 3 nights stay in this hotel become a pure nightmare.

One thing to note is that this is not a fully non-smoking hotel, and although we booked non -smoking rooms, one of the rooms smelled like an ash tray, I suspect they just removed the ash tray and called it \"non-smoking\". We probably should have asked to change rooms, but as we were travelling as a family, they had given us rooms next door to each other which was really convenient. Aside from this, the rooms were spotless with really comfy beds. On arrival, we received a complimentary glass of sangria (it was delicious!) Our stay also included breakfast each morning, and this was a highlight of our stay. The breakfast was amazing!!! They served the best bacon I have ever had!! Tons of choices - fruit, cereal, eggs, bacon, pastries, wine etc. It was fantastic. The hotel is in an excellent location, walking distance to lots of restaurants and shops, and other sites. There is also a metro station across the street. It was really easy to get around and the hotel staff was very helpful when we asked for directions. As well, the hotel manager was great. Very friendly and accommodating - he helped us with taxis, advised us on the most economical way to get to the airport, and helped us with online check in for our flights. He was great.

Only Two P.C's there with Internet access & they kept crashing in us(which was annoying), there's also WiFi (Can't Comment on it, wasn't equiped for it). Breakfast was simple & Basic (But Nice), same food every morning. But all in all i enjoyed my stay at this hotel & would recommend it Liked: Location Disliked: Computers kept crashing", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAvoid if you value your privacy\u201d", "Author": "lolaborro", "ReviewID": "UR23751342", "Content": "I booked a single room in this hotel for a friend that came to stay in Madrid and never again.

I explained I was with my friend who was a guest, and that we were going to his room, to what the receptionist replied that if I wasn't a guest, I couldn't go upstairs. I complained about this and in the end the receptionist 'allowed' me to go upstairs. About an hour later, guess what, we got a phone call from reception asking me to leave the room!!! The next evening, when my friend went back to the hotel after dinner, he found the door was shut!!! he banged and called for almost half an hour until someone finally came and opened up, and they claim to have a 24hr reception. Clearly, after this, my friend checked out and we found him another hotel, there's no way he was going to stay there any longer, and neither should you.", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Location": "5", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swindon, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "berylcook", "ReviewID": "UR23412130", "Content": "The best thing about this hotel is its location.

The location was terrific; right next to the opera house, the Palace was 2 blocks away, and Sol & Plaza Mayor and Cava Brava a short 10 minute walk ..Many good restaurants and sights are nearby within walking distance. The Vision on/off bus around the corner. The Opera metro also nearby. The hotel offers a cold buffet breakfast and as well has a cafe which serves some tapas, sandwiches and a limited menu most of the day. In addition there is the Cafe de la Opera, which unfortunately we did not get to try but seemed nice. It seems they have a connecting room on the 7th floor which may be of interest to families. The cold buffet was good in a comfortable breakfast room. Pastry, breads, coldcuts, chorizo, plenty of jamon, fruit and juice, yogurt & cereal. Sometimes tortilla espanola...good. It was all included in our room price. I would not pay more than 8 E for it otherwise, as there are plenty of places nearby. We were dissapointed with the accomodations. They were very dingy. The roof leaked. The carpet seemed dirty or perhaps just very faded . While the housekeeping staff was great, there was a mustiness about the place. Our room 706 faced a side street (good) had great windows with storm coverings that made the room pitchblack if desired, was average size with good a closet & great bath. The water pressure was wonderful with plenty of hot water. We requested a higher floor (Hotel has about 8 floors) and got the 1st floor. They quickly and obligingly changed us to the 7th floor. Good start. At this hotel one handles their own luggage. No problem , elevator was good. The room was average size for Spain, about 10 x 10. Noise from the street was minimal if the windows were closed. The uneven quality of the staff we expected. Some were very pleasant and helpful, others intentionally rude. On the last night it began to rain quite heavily. Within minites we had a large pool of water dripping through the ceiling on the bed. A very nice and very apologetic female desk clerk offered us any room available. We moved quickly in view of the amount of water falling through the ceiling, without any help however, to a better room (except for the terrible smell that permeates the smokers' rooms... ) The last night was not good. Upon check out the staff suggested it would be better if I hailed my own cab since we were traveling a shorter distance than the airport. The taxis might not like that, they said. No mention was made of the fiasco with the leaking roof this time. It looked as if the Opera Hotel had once been a distinguished lady in a sea of trendier places. Sadly this hotel is in now dire need of repairs. And perhaps a staff meeting of some sort . It is certainly in a charming area.
