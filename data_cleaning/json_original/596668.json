I travelled March 13 - 20 2012, during busy March break. From our greeting at the front door, refreshing drink, guidance on getting a good room and assistance with luggage etc. Everything was first class. Not an issue all week. Room was on outer side, shaded in the afternoon and close to beach, for easy access. 2nd floor around 1124 - 1118 are just right. Large clean room, great safe, dual sinks, lots hot water. Staff deserve every tip you can afford to give. They all work hard and smile continuously trying to please. People were treated fairly whether tipping or not. Someone mentioned to take a hundred ones and I'd recomend this as no change made at front desk. Minimum wage somewhere around $5 bucks a day. Yes thats right. I slept great knowing I helped these folks who never complained or balked at any requiest. Buffet was awesome. Lots of choices. Lots of seafood. Chillies was a superb steakhouse. Japanese was good, as was Chrystal. Pool bar was staffed by 8 staff daily. Never a wait. Lots of servers around pool and beach. A buck at the the beach keeps you more than properly served. Bring a cooler mug. Pool was large and never crowded. Very clean. Lots of loungers at beach and pool. Lots of natural shade too from the palm canopy. To get front row you had to get out by eight. But it was not necessary to get up early to get a reasonable chair at pool or beach. Shows were ok to. Lots dancing and singing by good musicians. Not over the top and not to long. Enjoyed the downtime relaxing at the show. Social team worked hard, drumming up guests for games. Volleyball was great. Their spirit was genuine and made all kids and adults feel welcome at the events. Overall a geat trip at a great resort with 5 star staff, food and facilities. You can't go wrong.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "stpaullori", "Title": "\u201cSpring break\u201d", "Author": "loristpaul", "ReviewID": "UR126310719", "Content": "We just returned from the RIU Riviera Maya Palace for spring break.

The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. A special thank-you to Edgar, we had a problem with our flight, the night before we were leaving, and even though he had just gotten off work, he went back behind the desk and time and effort trying to help us resolve the issue. I liked that this resort was a mix of young and old and people from all over. The food was good for an all- inclusive and the buffet is better then the specialty restaurants. I had always heard the wine was terrible at all-inclusives but they had a nice Chilean red Cabernet and Chardonnay. I loved that we could walk the beach into town and that it wasn't overwhelmingly big. The beach is gorgeous and even though it was sold out when we were there, you could always get chairs by the pool and beach. It's also a nice perk that you can go to any of the other RIU'S.

It is a beautiful resort, rooms and grounds are spotless, no bugs or mozzies. Super hot this time of year but not too humid in the evenings which is great. Bar service at the pool and in the evening in fantastic, shows are the usual offering, some really funny but nothing exceptional, we had more fun sat around the lobby bar chatting to people. Food is good both buffet and a la carte, I would give the Brazilian a steer, the worst of all of them. We noticed that since 3 years ago when we travelled last that the premium brand drinks have declined slightly, they still serve Absolout and Smirnoff Vodka but no longer Jack Daniels, only Jim Beam. We booked an upgraded jacuzzi suite as it was our wedding anniversary but dissapointingly when we arrived it wasn't available on our first night, we instead had a suite and he following night was moved to the correct room. If you want one of these rooms I can recommend room 2046 which has a great ocean view and that of the pool and courtyard. The hotel did some things to 'make it up to us', but to me they didn't really go out of their way, not even a note or anything in our room on our anniversary, shame. I think that is what lets this hotel down for me, is that they are catering for the masses and whilst everyone is very friendly they just don't get how to make it special and you feel like you are an individual, small touches could fix this. Also, the gym is useless, really needs updating, only one treadmill working the whole trip (2 weeks), the other squeaked very loudly and the rest of the gym equipment is old and clunky, not easy for my husband to lift weights. Also, we visited the other hotels, the Riviera Maya far outshines all of them, my only wish would be that the hotel would provide a little shuttle bus up and down the road to drop outside each hotel and finally to the end where you can go into Playa Del Carmen.

We had been to one of its sister resorts (RIU Playacar) and had mixed reviews. We love the loction, so we thought we'd upgrade to a \"5-star\" to see if it was better. It was definitely better. The service and the cleanliness of the grounds was excellent! The staff was eager to please - from the front desk to the waiters that offered us drinks on the beach. The grounds are beautiful and immaculate. The rooms were OK. We had two - a standard jr. suite and a \"superior\" jr.suite. The only difference was the view from the balcony. One looked out over the central pools and gardens and the other had no view at all - just some grass and a privacy fence. If you don't plan to spend much time on your balcony, don't waste extra money on a superior suite. The location is great. It's a pleasant, safe, 15-20 minute walk into interesting Playa del Carmen. We had no concerns about safety at all - either on the resort or in town. The buffet food was very good. The restaurants were good also but don't expect 5-star meals. The wine is served out of a bottle which is a big step up from the casks at Playacar. It's not great quality but it's acceptable. I wish they'd offer more beer variety than the Dos Equis on tap. The pool is very nice. It's a little cramped and noisy with constant entertainment games poolside which for me was a little tiresome. The beach area is spectacular! There were lots of loungers and space either in the sun or under palm trees. You could be on the main beach or the private hotel beach area.

The room is a decent size however it does have a musty smell (same smell as last year).

The staff did a fantastic job making sure their days were fantastic. The food was very good. Buffet was well presented, extensive, and fresh. Botofogo, Chilis, and Agave were all good but limited selections. TIP - contact them before you get there to make up to 2 reservations. Fusion and Japenese are hardest to get so if you want them, these may be the ones to request prior to arrival. The others seemed to have room when we ate there and the resort was at 90% capacity. Bar service was generally good, especially around the pool. The beach was limited or non-existent. TIP - bring your insulated cup. We do whenever we travel south. You can get more quantity and it stays cold instead of turning warm in 10 minutes. The beach was one of the largest and best we have been to. Our kids had no trouble swimming in the ocean and our parents had no problem finding chairs in the shade under a palm tree. The sand was clean and well maintained. The location was great. A short walk to Playa del Carmen for those that want the amenities of a city or to ferry to Cozumel. A 10 minute walk South for our morning Starbucks fix or some shopping. A nice safe neighborhood in which to have a morning run as well. The resort was about 45 minutes from the airport. My only apprehension prior to going was whether this resort would seem to formal or not friendly for the kids. Though not a lot of kids were here while we were, in no way did we feel out of place. I am a compulsive researcher prior to traveling and have utilized this site for years.

Resort was very similar to Riu in Guanacaste, Costa Rica which we visited in Dec 2011...identical room furnishings, in-room liquor dispensor, etc. Our room overlooked the courtyard which we liked. Weather was perfect! Grounds are very well maintained and beach was great - plenty of chairs, plenty of palm trees for shade, good service by the pool bar staff who bring trays of drinks for you to choose from, or will take your order. The swim up bar area can get crazy, but the adjacent raised infinity pool was really nice. A few vendors walk the beach selling hats, jewelry and sunglasses, but few and far between and not a nuisance. The size of the resort was smaller than what we've been in previously, but that made getting to your room that much easier/faster.

After doing some research and looking at pictures online we decided to stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. What an excellent choice! The resort is located in Playacar (which is a gated community) and not once did we feel unsafe. The resort is absolutely gorgeous. The customer service here is awesome. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. It didn't matter what time of the day it was there was ALWAYS someone fixing or cleaning something. The staff were constantly maintaining the place and making sure everything looked spotless. The pool was awesome! Great swim up bar. There was lots of sun chairs around the pool area and tons on the beach. There was lots of plam trees which made it very tropical and good for some shade. The beach was perfect! Soft white sand and turquoise blue water! The restaurants at the resort were all pretty good. The main buffet was great for breakfast and dinner with lots to choose from. Chillis always had a great buffet for lunch. We went to a few of the specialty restaurants and found the Japanese restaurant to be one of the better ones and I don't even like sushi. Get the deep fried ice cream for dessert it was delicious. The Brazilian restaurant wasn't very good just ALOT of meat. The entertainment was great. They were always getting the guests involved in whatever activity was going on. Either volleyball, dancing, bingo, water aerobics, darts, boccie ball or any other contest they had going on. The courtyard was the place to be after dinner and usually had a band playing until the show started. There was no club at this resort but if you wanted you could go to the Disco at the Riu Tequila which was just down the road. Maybe a 5 minute walk. We checked out the other Riu resorts and saw some monkeys at Riu Yucatan. We did some shopping in Playa Del Carmen which is very close, you can easily walk to 5th Ave from the resort or take a cab. It costs about 70 pesos or $7. Even though this resort is \"All inclusive\" the staff work extremely hard and are providing you with a service so i suggest you bring extra money to tip.

Tour operator was Sunwing and we were flying from Toronto. Having stayed 3 years ago at the Riu Tequila just down the street we were familiar with the Riu setup and Playa del Carmen in general. It's the only southern destination we've ever returned to. Easy access to town, nice beaches and great food make for a pleasing vacation for us. Beautiful lobby greeted us as we entered and very friendly and helpful staff at the reception desk. We checked in to our junior suite, facing north on the outer perimeter of the hotel overlooking \"The Reef\" hotel. Nice and quiet. The room was very clean with the bedroom (king size bed) on one level and a seating area with Sony LCD flatscreen a couple of steps down. Nice enough room but to be honest I wasn't \"wowed\". I expected a little more of a Palace. Despite Arriving at 11pm we decided to walk around the grounds and they were truly immaculate. There are two pools - an infinity pool overlooking a regular pool. Both very nice but we preferred the former as it was slightly warmer. Lots of chairs available but the best spots go quickly. Lots of shady spots available under the palm trees for those that need respite from the sun. Swim up pool bar available as well as waiter service. The beach is framed by palm trees on either side for shade and closer to the water it becomes open. It was very windy during our weeks stay and we were happy to have the palm trees provide some protection from the sand whipping across the beach. The beach is very nice. We did find that the ocean floor was very uneven, and in combination with the high waves (due to the wind) and undercurrent meant that you had to be careful. The padding on the beach chairs could do with replacing as some were getting a bit worse for wear. Waiter service is available on the beach closer to the hotel (a fence divides the two sections) but service is a little less frequent than around the pool. Reservations for the specialty restaurants are taken in the south east corner of the lobby bar between noon and 3pm, for the same day and the next. Seatings are at 6.30 and 8.45 (except for the steak restaurant which is 7 and 8.30). We tried the Japanese, Brazilian and Mexican restaurants, the latter two being our favourites. I have always found that the hotels try hard to replicate international flavours but don't quite manage with those cultures that are not similar to their own. E.g. in the Japanese restaurant the sushi had no raw fish - smoked salmon was the closest to raw, and some of the rolls contained cream cheese - a very odd ingredient. The buffet restaurant is excellent for both breakfast and dinner. Lots of options and nobody should have any difficulty finding something that they like. Service in the restaurants and throughout the hotel is excellent and the staff are very friendly - our best experience of any hotel and any southern destination. Claudia, the bartender at the bar where shows are performed was fantastic - very funny and provided excellent drink suggestions and service. We had a few memorable nights propped up at the bar watching the very good shows (Michael Jackson, Broadway and Disco). Internet access is free in the lobby, supposedly for max. 90 minutes but I don't believe it's regulated at all as I was never kicked off. In-room wi-fi costs $10/hour, $15 for 3 hours or $39 for 3 days, although don't quote me on that because I couldn't find it listed anywhere and I'm going on what I was told in person by a staff member. Guests are predominantly Canadian and US with others from South America and Europe. We only encountered one staff member whose English wasn't very good. Guests tend to be on the older side but there's people of all ages staying there. Overall I would definitely recommend the RPRM. Apart from a few minor gripes we were very happy with the hotel. Sunwing on the other hand had a delayed flight to Mexico and another (3 hours) on the return leg - we'll think twice before using them again.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe found Paradise!\u201d", "Author": "SuZztravels", "ReviewID": "UR125810597", "Content": "This was a perfect place to spend a week in Febuary!

Here are my comparisons to Yucatan. Lobby The Palace is much more grand.... Marble floors vs tile, totally enclosed vs open air, much larger space. The lobby bar has twice as much seating with nicer tables and chairs. Servers will wait on you for drinks vs more self service at the Yucatan lobby. Both offer free WIFI in their lobbies. Rooms The Palace rooms are junior suites with a two level room with a seperate sunken living space with a couch for 3 and flat screen TV. The Yucatan has no couch and has old style TV's. You get the same channels in both. The floors are marble vs tile. We actually had a KING bed vs 2 doubles pushed together and didn't feel the need for a mattress topper at the palace. Both have mini fridges and liquor dispensors. The difference being the Palace bottles are ALL brand names. Absolut, bacardi, Jose and BRANDY.... Yucatan had no brandy. The only downside to the PALACE rooms is that we could hear all the sounds from the long hallways all through the night. This did not happen at Yucatan as the blocks of rooms are small and no interior hallways. You actually get a card for your room key vs an actual KEY at the Yucatan and the safe is electronic with a code vs a lock and key at Yucatan Beaches These resorts share basically the same beach... they are just 500-700m or so away from each other. There are a few hotels between the 2 of them. Both have gorgeous white sand, and beautiful water. There are more Palm trees to lay under at the Palace if you are a shade seeker. Was surprised they didn't offer drink service on the beach. Being a Palace, we were expecting this. It's a long walk from the beach/water to the pool bar. Food We had 1 buffet dinner and 2 ala cartes while we were here. At the buffet they actually seat you vs grabbing your own table at Yucatan. Service slightly more attentive as they seemed to have much more staff. The food quality and how they present it also better. We ate at the Steakhouse and Fancy Gourmet restaurants. Enjoyed BOTH meals. Steak isn't exactly the best I have had but was tasty and cooked properly. They bring a tray of Caesar salad and assorted seafood as well. The wine is actually bottled wine and they will leave the bottle. They offer a Chilean Merlot and Chilean CAB SAV. Again, it was ok but MUCH better wine than the Yucatan. Our fav meal was the Fancy Gourmet. It's a small restaurant but service was awesome and the food was different. Portions are small so if you are a big eater stick to buffet. We had SEA BASS and it was very tasty and well cooked. All the ala carte restaurants offer 2 seatings. 6 and 8:45 I believe.....These need to be booked in the lobby area. We lunched at the restaurant near the beach and they serve very similar food to the Yucatan lunch spot. but they don't allow food to be taken out of restaurant and no barefeet and shirts required I believe - which is not the case at Yucatan Pools Basically they have an Endless pool and the main pool. The main pool is very wide with fountains right in the pool, built in loungers on the 2 ends and a huge pool bar that faces inside to the property. The pools are much bigger than the Yucatan but only 1 pool bar vs 2 at the Yucatan. The pool bar area has seperate horseshoe areas in which you can get a group to sit around and party and drink and thats excatly what happens. The pool bar is VERY lively nd busy ALL day long. Much busier than Yucatan bars. But the bartenders work very hard and you never really have to wait very long for any drink. Tipping will expedite your service:) . There is a 24 hour sports bar in the lobby area. We walked in a few times around midnite and there would be a few young people (20 somethings) there but not a real party place while we were there. I think many walk over to the Tequila disco. The night life is very dead at this resort. The Lobby bar closes at 12:00 whereas the Yucatan Lobby bar is open ALL night till 7:00am. The only place to get drinks after midnight is the 24 hour sports bar. We enjoyed our 3 days here and if you can get a half decent deal here it is definitely an upgrade to the Yucatan.

On the surface, the experience was good. Good service, clean and spacious accommodations. Nice pool. The beach is the greatest benefit--wide,soft sand, easy access and there's space under the palm trees in the shade or directly in the sun depending on your preference. I also never felt like I was sitting elbow to elbow with other guests--something we noticed at other resorts when we walked down the beach. The pool bar is just steps away from the beach and the staff bring drinks around often. Chili's open air restaurant serves lunch and snacks all day next to the pool/bar. There was a good variety of food on the buffets and as it wasn't a busy week, we had no problems getting reservations at 3 of the 5 specialty restaurants throughout the week. We could have eaten at the others but chose to go back to Krystal twice (the best). Breakfast was our favorite meal because you could get made to order omelets, pancakes and french toast. If you stay at this Riu or Riu Palace Mexico a few doors down, you can eat breakfast and lunch at the other Riu's in Playacar. But the food is virtually the same at both. You can't beat the location--it's the best of the Riu resorts in the Playacar complex and closest to town. Just a 15-minute walk past resorts and upscale houses and you're on Playa Del Carmen's 5th avenue. You can get there a few minutes faster on the beach. Five minutes in the other direction there is a quaint little shopping area in the Playacar Complex (complete with Starbucks). The beds were more comfortable than other travellers reported--a nice king. We did ask for the mattress topper when we checked in which housekeeping delivered within minutes. Our maid did an excellent job keeping our room clean and stocked daily. If you want to ensure that your needs are met, do leave a nice tip every day. We asked for extra bottled water and diet soda the first day and didn't have to ask again the rest of the week. The floors and hallways are all tile and are mopped religiously every day. I only had two concerns with this resort--the room, although spotlessly clean, smelled very musty. The smell clung to everthing including my suitcase. In speaking to other guests, they said they have not encountered this in other Caribbean resorts. It was really too hot to leave the sliders open at night to air the room out. My other, bigger complaint is the beach towel policy. They gave each guest a towel card at check in. You could exchange it once per day at the pool for a clean towel. If you lose your card, you pay $20 for another one. There were three days we didn't use the pool or beach. On the last day, we returned from a snorkeling trip to Cozemel at 4 p.m. and were told there were no more clean towels. Our room wasn't close to the pool so I didn't want to waste the time to retrieve a towel from my room. That's unacceptable to me. An upscale all inclusive beach resort should not run out of towels. It may seem small, but I came here to sit on the beach and was really disappointed in the way the Riu horded their towels. The towel boy referred me to the front desk but it was a long walk. When I checked out, the desk staff seemed unconcerned with my complaint saying only with a shrug, 'well maybe we had a lot of people check in that day.\" But the wait staff in the restaurants were friendly and responsive, always at your elbow to take away your empty plates or bring you another beer or glass of wine. If you are fan of mixed drinks, ask them to pour you a double. Those I had were pretty watered down and I'm not much of a drinker. This is a Dos Equis resort and they serve only two kinds of red Mexican wine--both pretty bad. They do have a Chilean cabernet in Krystal that's better. Several times I got a margarita or daquiri from the pool bar and poured more rum or tequila from the mini bar in our room. Entertainment is over by 11 p.m. and the bars stop serving promptly at midnight. One night we were in the lobby bar surfing the internet and they started turning the lights out on us!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cowes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent on both visits 2008 & 2010\u201d", "Author": "CJWO80", "ReviewID": "UR125751545", "Content": "On both visits to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya I experienced excellent service from all staff in addition to a fantastic range of food and activites.

Sorry for the belated review. This website provides lots of valuable tips so we want to reciprocate. Most of the reviews are subjective so I\u2019ll attempt to keep it brief. We\u2019re intelligent enough to realize that a 5-star resort in Mexico isn\u2019t comparable to a 5-star in Canada/USA. Ignore the majority of the negative feedback. I believe these people have unrealistic expectations for the price they paid. We picked this resort based on the following: close proximity to Playa del Carmen (20 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride), fabulous beach, consistently great weather, decent price and previous experience at a RIU Palace (Cabo). This was our second time staying in the Playacar area in the past five years so we knew the lay of the land. This is a gated community (similar to Florida) with at least a dozen resorts, condos and a golf course. Very safe. I believe the RIU chain has five properties (not all on the ocean) in this community which you have reciprocating privileges. We previously stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal Playacar which was decent and a few resorts down. The RIU Palace Riviera Maya is the nicest resort in this area. Very stately and architecturally impressive. The only neighboring resort that would be comparable is the Royal Hideaway (more expensive, adults only, no swim-up bar, no hobie cats, no buffet). We emailed the resort ahead of time and requested a third floor room and made two dinner reservations. palace.rivieramaya@riu.com Room: We stayed in room # 2135 which was on the third floor. It was classified as garden view and overlooked a neighboring property not the courtyard. Very quiet and clean. Room was a little musty but expected in a tropical location. Bring some air fresheners. Room was nicely appointed. Bed was firm but comfortable. Never saw a bug. Air conditioning worked great. Safe worked great. No issues with theft. Lots of towels. Bar fridge stocked daily. Leave housekeeping a decent daily tip and you won\u2019t have a problem. We didn\u2019t receive turn down service nor did we expect it. Only complaint is the heaviness of the doors that would automatically close behind you. The sound of doors slamming in the middle of the night would carry in the tiled hallway. I blame this on inconsiderate guests. Food: Decent but the RIU Palace Cabo was much better. Great breakfast buffet. Try the cappuccino. As previously stated we emailed the resort ahead of time and made two dinner reservations. All other reservations are made at noon in the lobby bar up to three days in advance. No problem getting reservations. Krystal was the standout restaurant. We ate here twice. The Mexican restaurant was good. Buffet good. Lunch was adequate. No poolside BBQ which we\u2019ve experienced at other resorts. We enjoyed dinner at two other establishments in town to experience some local culture. Sur and Cenacola. Both were excellent. Beach: Oustanding. Sadly after our last stay (five years previous) the beach was wiped out by a hurricane. It\u2019s back and better then ever! No problem securing a lounge chair under a palm tree. Didn\u2019t have to get up early to play the towel game. Beautiful turquoise water. Perfect for swimming- not too rough, sandy bottom, no seaweed. Went for a walk every morning. Even pit stopped at few other resorts for a refreshing beverage. Look at all the other resorts on the beach and you\u2019ll see the Riu Palace Riviera Maya is the nicest. A few vendors on the beach but they never hassled you. Borrow the complimentary snorkel gear and grab some bread from the buffet. When facing the ocean, turn right and walk past the last resort (Sandos). There is a reef about 50 feet from shore in 15 ft deep water. Tons of tropical fish. We took a hobie cat out a few times. Amazing. We would sit on a lounge chair at night with a bottle of champagne and enjoy the sound of the waves. Pool: Gorgeous. Pool was great for a refreshing dip. Looked like the towel game was in full swing reserving loungers early in the AM. Didn\u2019t bother us as the beach is one of the nicest in the world. Who wants to sit beside a pool all day? Can do that at home. Bars: Swim up bar was busy. Only complaint is people leaving their ten year old kids there all day unsupervised. We brought Bubba Kegs from home thus preventing numerous trips back to the bar or having to wait servers to come around. We tipped generously and received excellent service. If you feel the drinks are watered down, tell them. They\u2019ll put more alcohol in them. No problem. The lobby bar had a decent crowd at night. Perfect for grabbing a bottle of champagne or an after dinner drink. Playa del Carmen/ 5th Avenue: The number one reason to stay in this area of Mexico. A 5-minute-$7-cab-ride (non negotiable) or a 20 minute walk in the sweltering heat. We went every night after dinner. It\u2019s a pedestrian only roadway lined with bars, restaurants, cafes, clothing and jewelry stores. Majority of businesses are air conditioned which would provide welcome relief. Lots to see and do. Tons of tourists. Great to experience the local culture. Police presence everywhere. They know tourism is their bread and butter. Very safe. We ate here twice. Sur and Cenacola. Both excellent. Taxis are plentiful. Resort Property: Impeccably maintained. Never utilized the gym (on vacation). Never was around to experience any of the night time entertainment. Service was excellent. If you tip they\u2019ll remember you and bend over backwards to please. Beautiful open square courtyard which would have different activities each night: craft and jewelry vendors, a guy playing a Spanish guitar, casino night. Free WiFi in the lobby but it is slow and sometimes difficult to get connected. Grab a drink at the bar and check your email. Go with an open mind. Relax. You\u2019re on vacation. Not everything will go smoothly. Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff and be that obnoxious, arrogant tourist that everyone loathes. A few bucks in tips goes a long way. These people make a pittance. If you can\u2019t afford to bring 100 US $1 dollar bills for tips then you shouldn\u2019t go on vacation. If you want a true 5-star experience book the Four Seasons and pay double the price. Never did any tours this time as they chew up your whole day. Bring sunscreen from home. It is very expensive in the gift shop. We would recommend this resort and stay here again.

If I had done more research I would have stayed at a different resort. The all inclusive aspect is a bit misleading and I will explain why. The equipment is all inclusive, but not the full use of the equipment. We were able to get the equipment for snorkeling but was only allowed to snorkel within a confined area at the beach, limited to about 50 yards in length and 20 yards in width, this area has no fish or coral to view, so quite pointless. Other all inclusive resorts we have stayed at actually take you out on snorkeling trips at no cost. To go out on a trip would have cost at a minimum of $39 pp. The 7 restaurants are not all inclusive in the sense that you can go and eat at these restaurants at any time of the day for any meal. Only 2 of the restaurants were this way and they were the buffet meals. The other 5 required reservations which could only be made between the hours of 12-3pm, which we had trouble with since we were on excursions during these times, and there were no exceptions to this rule. The staff was hit and miss in attentiveness and politeness. The front desk and bell hops were exceptional in their service but the bartenders and service people were not so much. I would go to a bar and be the only one there and would have to wait for the bartenders to finish their conversations before being attended to. Overall service was quite disappointing. The beach was very nice and well kept, they actually bury the seaweed to keep it nice and clean. The room was well kept and good in size. The tv was old and small. The shower was great. The bed was big but the pillows were quite bad. The area of the hotel was very nice and the grounds well kept. The events that they had were fun including fake casino games, occasional vendors for shopping, and dancing to name a few. The only benefit to staying at a Riu resort in my opinion is that they allow you to visit the other Riu resorts at no cost and even allow you to eat at the other resort restaurants, except for dinner, you cannot have dinner at the other resorts. In conclusion, the beach, the room, and the area were nice but the services and restaurants were poor which is what we looked forward to the most.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northeast Missouri", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "Stand-Alone", "ReviewID": "UR125556273", "Content": "We travelled from February 9-16, 2012.

The food was very good. On Sunday night the buffet served grilled jumbo shrimp and lobster tail that was phenomenal. Generally, the buffet food is better than that at the restaurants. We ate at the Japanese restaurant which was our favorite, as well as Krystal, which was good, not great. Drinks at the resort were very good, and you can always get top shelf liquor if you ask. We found the wine to be drinkable, not good, but not bad either. The room was always very clean and comfortable. Beds a bit small and very firm. They gave us a rollaway bed, as the four of us (and we are thin people) would not have fit in 2 double beds comfortably. We had an upgraded junior superior suite with an extra large balcony overlooking the plaza on the second floor. The service at the resort, from the front desk staff, waiters, housekeeping, EVERYONE was outstanding. Luigi, who is part of the entertainment staff looked after my 10 year old son and some other boys he met, without making them feel like they were being looked after. He even ate lunch with them, and kept them entertained playing soccer, volleyball, ping pong, darts, and bocce ball, all of which are located on the beautiful beach. Many of the staff went out of their way to make a connection with their customers. We were able to use the resorts complimentary boogie boards and kayaks for one hour a day. Contrary to other reviews, we found the pool to be clean and warm. Most days I did reserve chairs by 7am, otherwise the pool loungers were taken, and I wanted to be able to watch over my kids as they swam, since there are no lifeguards. There were always open chairs on the beach. The entertainment in the theater at night was fair, with the Michael Jackson show standing out as the best. I would've been happy to go to bed early, but each night our kids insisted on going to the theater. Overall, this was an outstanding family vacation.

Lomas Travel was our on-site travel company, and we thoroughly enjoyed working with Hernan who presented us with a variety of options for day trips, listened to our ideas ,booked the trip we wanted to take, and did not pressure us in any way.

The guy that does the spray paint art is simply amazing and I highly recommend you watch him as he makes the art, leaves you wondering how he does it. The maids do beautiful towel art and if you consistenly tip them you will get more and more everyday (5 USD+). When you get ready for the day simply move your towel art off the bed and onto the coffee table and when you get back you will have the original and an additional towel animal placed on your bed upon your arrival after it has been cleaned. DO NOT BOOK EXCURSIONS through the hotel as I found them to be 25-50% more expensive. Instead get an idea of pricing from your rep in the lobby bar and then take that price to the hut in the playacar plaza and they will give you a way better deal. *Tip* walk along the beach and visit the other riu's and be happy you chose this one as it is superior.

First of all I must warn you that if you get a room near an ice machine go right back to the front desk.

They had to stuff them into checked luggage while at the American Airlines counter in one case and were rejected at security in the other. In both instances, the rackets went via checked luggage on the return fligh. Not a catastrophe, but surely an inconvenience following a very good vacation. Just be aware. This is the second time for us with the Riu chain. It was a great place to relax, with no real drama anywhere. The place is kept immaculately clean and orderly. We\u2019ve been to several all inclusives, and this ones food selection and in-room soda/liquor was superior. The staff was very attentative and unobtrusive. Check out and in was easy (we were Tuesday to Tuesday). We used Apple Vacations which provided the best price and a very convenient aircraft to hotel direct limo service (really a van). I recommend it. All in all \u2013 a good value. The beach was large and most folks spent their time there, though we stayed at the one and only pool.

We were facing another complex and I think these rooms are possibly quieter than facing the courtyard. However did find the clothes in the wardrobe felt damp. There was also no lighting in the lounge area or balcony so if you want to sit out in the evening you have to sit in the dark! Location was nice and the beach was lovely but unfotunately we had several days when the sea was too rough to go in. Close to playa del carmen shops (20 min walk) and a small parade of shops (10 mins) if you turn left out of the hotel. Didnt like the pool area at all. All the beds around the pool were reserved early leaving only the shady beds which if you are a sun worshipper, as I am, is a disappointment. Also very noisy around the pool bar with animation team activities continuously throughout the day. I like some peace and quiet in the day so preferred the beach. The food in the buffet restaurant offered a reasonable choice but some evenings better than others. Not enough sea food on offer. Breakfasts offered a good choice and lunch could either be taken in the buffet or Chillis restaurant. Didnt like the Brazillian restaurant (food very salty) or Krystals (just not my taste), Chillis, the Mexican and Japanese were all pretty good. The lobby bar was very nice, cocktails lovely and waiters very attentive. Never had to wait long for a drink! The staff throughout the complex were all very friendly. The complex was very clean but I really do not think the floor needs to be swept in the evening while you are eating (this happened both times we went to Chillis restaurant).

It holds a special place in my heart as my fiance proposed to me on the beach in front of the resort! We stayed at the resort during the first week of December 2010, for his brother's wedding. This was my first time staying in an all-inclusive and I definitely think I was spoiled. The resort is stunning! The grounds are perfectly manicured and it's extremely clean! Our room was located on the third floor of the four-story building. We really liked how the resort was much smaller than many others we've seen or heard about. We were never more than a 2 minute walk from any of the restaurants, lobby or pool. Every member of our family had nothing but great things to say about their stay. The staff were unbelievably friendly and got to know our family by name which made us feel extra special. Unlike some other resorts that I've heard have the same buffet food everyday, the buffet had endless choices and rarely did we see a dish repeated throughout our stay. We ate at the Mexican restaurant one evening and everyone loved the food and drinks. The wedding reception was held at Chili's (the restaurant where lunch is served) and once again everyone liked the food. The bar at the pool aptly named \"Daiquiri\" made the most delicious drinks and the bar inside the lobby made wonderful Spanish coffees which we'd have after dinner most nights.The entertainment was great as well. The night of the wedding we all watched the Michael Jackson show which was amazing! The pool is beautiful and enormous (coming from someone who's a competitive swimmer and has swum in a lot of pools)! It was a little cold, but we spent most of our time on the beach and in the ocean. We also loved how the resort was very close to Fifth Avenue (less than a 10 minute walk) which is the shopping hub in Playa del Carmen. The resort was also a five minute walk from a number of shops and the cutest Starbucks you've ever seen! Something we all really liked was how safe we felt throughout our stay. I personally don't think Mexico is the safest place to travel and two weeks before our trip a big resort in Playa del Carmen had a massive explosion and a number of people died. We were so happy that the Rui was located in Playacar where there was high security and any vehicle entering or exiting the area had to pass through a check-point and provide identification.

Also, the rooms were cleaned at least two times per day, and turndown service was standard. The standard rooms, which are all junior suites, were nicely appointed, and came fully stocked with everything one could possibly need during their holiday away from home. Each restaurant offered quite nice food selections, however our least favorite was the steakhouse, but this was just out of personal preference. Believe it or not, the dinner buffet was one of the best ones that one might encounter at an all-inclusive!

Our initial two visits were to the RIU Palace, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, so in this review I\u2019ll compare the two, as they are both Caribbean RIU resorts. General This Mexican RIU Palace is a beautiful hotel, with well-maintained gardens and large junior suites. However, despite being in a gated community, the frontage of the hotel was disappointing. The road leading to it contained numerous small \u2018haciendas\u2019, many having boards stating \u2018for sale\u2019 or \u2018to let\u2019 and with some looking a little run down. Not a pleasant sight. Compare this to the frontage of the RIU Palace Dominican Republic, where the hotel is in a smart gated community, reached via lush vegetation and with the hotel being at the end of the road, rising like a great palace in the distance. Arrival When we arrived, there was no porter at the doors of the hotel (apparently his day off!!), so we had to lug our own cases to the hotel reception, where we were asked if we would like a drink, whereas at the RIU Palace Punta Cana, we were greeted warmly, helped with our cases and drinks were automatically brought to us. After some delay, we were escorted to our room, but the porter just hung around in the room staring at us waiting for a tip. This was no surprise, as the taxi driver from the airport had a large notice at the front basically instructing you to tip him, this being placed over a large wine glass containing some money, just to give you the idea! We found it unpleasant to be made to feel like cash cows. Compare this to the RIU Dominican Republic, where we had a lovely taxi ride with no begging for a tip and no pressure to give a tip when our bags were taken to our room. Food As usual, the food was exceptional, with the various themed restaurants being available if required, although the main buffet restaurant has more choice. I had the best roast lamb I\u2019d ever tasted in the main restaurant. We tried the Brazilian Restaurant, but were not impressed. You help yourself to the first course, salad or soup. This was followed by the vegetables eventually arriving at your table, followed by various meats on skewers being brought around to the tables oh so slowly. We had to eat our vegetables first, or they would have been cold! A totally boring experience in our view, so we left. The steak house was very good indeed, but again the service was very slow. The food in the main buffet is so good that we much preferred this, with many choices for first course, mains and desserts being available, so we were never bored. At the RIU Punta Cana Dominican Republic, one of their themed nights involved \u2018Langosta\u2019 which sadly was not on offer in Mexico during our stay. Cocktails These were excellent. Beach and Pool The pool was very nice, but the sun beds were old and topped with very faded, tired yellow pads. On the beach, there were numerous sun beds, plenty for all, but again they were in need of refurbishment. Most of their faded blue covers were badly sagging and many were covered in dried bird droppings. Birds These were a real problem for us. Firstly, when seated in the main restaurant, if you sat outside the numerous large birds flew in, stole food whilst you were sitting there and quickly flew away. They also perched in the lighting above the outdoor part of the restaurant, so it was always a worry they would defecate on us whilst we were eating. On the beach, the problem was much worse. A number of guests would feed the seagulls that would arrive just before lunch. Food would be thrown in the air for them, so we were inundated with seagulls. Of course, seagulls do what seagulls do, which is to empty their bowels whilst in flight. On one occasion, having already put up with being nose-dived on numerous occasions, I was lying on a sun bed when a seagull flew overhead, dropping what was probably the entire contents of its bowels over me, splattering my baseball cap, my body, my arm and my face, with the excrement eventually flowing into my ear. It was totally disgusting. Summary of holiday from 25 January - 1 February 2012 The RIU Palace Riviera Maya is a beautiful hotel, with spacious well-maintained suites, lush gardens, excellent food and helpful friendly staff. The location was a let down for us. Sadly, we had no feeling of being in the Caribbean that you get when on any of the islands, but more a feeling of commercial tourism, with tips seemingly being expected, rather than earned for good service. For us, the birds at the restaurant and on the beach were a problem and it\u2019s a great pity they are encouraged by tourists feeding them. We won\u2019t be returning to this RIU hotel or the location, but would gladly return to the RIU Palace, Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic for a third time.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRIU PALACE RIVIERA MAYA - ROOMS SMELL MUSTY\u201d", "Author": "flashgordon777", "ReviewID": "UR124126601", "Content": "We were on a short vacation from Florida. We arrived early and our luggage was left in the foyer, while we had to wait for our room to be ready...come back at 3pm. We showed up promptly at 3pm and were given our keys to the room and had our luggage brought to our room. The moment we entered the room, you could smell a musty odor which was terrible. We immediately went to the front desk to exchange rooms, as the odor was unacceptable. Told them they should come and smell the room, and if they thought that was normal in there own house. They told us it was late in the day and there were no rooms available, but they would have us moved the following day. They said they would send someone with a dehumidifier to the room, so we waited for so long for them to bring it. What they brought was a humidifier with some solution which spray a freshner smell which only masked the odor. The next day they moved us to another room as promised, and the cleaner must have been told as it smelled like they had use some kind of spray to take away the smell. It was not as bad as the other room, but still the musty smell was there masked by the cleaning solution. It did not take very long (2 days) for that room to smell musty like the other room, even trying to open the balcony doors to air out the room did not work. There must be something wrong with the air conditioning, ventilation system for this to be a problem in more than just one room. I agree with another traveller who has posted simular issue, and yes your clothes will smell musty and when you get home it will smell like the room at the RIU. I personally will not be returning to this resort, for this reason alone as breathing this foul musty smell cannot be good for your health.

All the hotel staff, from the front desk, Pool bar staff to the cleaners were extremely polite and happy to help. After the first night we asked at Reception if we could be moved as our balcony view was of the hotel generators they were pretty noisey. The front desk staff were more than happy to accomate us and we were upgraded for free to a room overlooking the beautiful court yard. Our room was cleaned everyday to a high standard, little chocolates were left on the bed on 2 or 3 occasions and the mini bar was re-stocked as and when needed. The two pools were really nice but we only used the pool once during our stay as there was a gorgeous private beach area with steps down on to the main beach and the sparkling blue Caribbean sea. Quick tip - if you want sun loungers by the pool or the beachthen you need to get up early to put your towels out. There are a number of water sport activies you can take advantage of.....para-sailing, scuba diving, body boarding and wave runners. We both had a go at using the body boards as the caribbean sea waves were perfect for body boarding but could be a bit rough at times too. All of the food was of an extremely high standard and wonderfully presented, the Riu Palace has 5 restaurants to chose from but you must book these in advance to avoid disappointment. Brazilian - This was our favourite and we ate here on our second night and final night at the Riu Palace. This is a meat restaurant, where the staff bring different types of meat to your table to try. There was approx 6 different meats, from beef, chicken, turkey and sausage. Japanese - The decor of this restaurant was outstanding and the food was amazing; the sushi was delightful. Fusion - The food in Fusion was again of an expectional standard and would be worthy on the menu of any of the 5 star hotels in London. Mexican - The beef and chicken Fajita was really nice but you have to ask for additional wraps as you only get two each. Steak house - We only ate at the Steak house once and were slightly disappointed as this is where you eat lunch each day and it didn't have the same ambience as the other restaurants. However the rib-eye steak I had was well cooked. International buffet - The buffet was really nice with a great selection of food. Overall I would highly recommend staying at this hotel if you are thinking of visiting Mexico and don't want to stay in Cancun.

We enjoyed the shows, with different acts on every night. The food was really good.The buffet restaurant had some great dishes and plenty of variety for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Late breakfast and lunch could also be taken at Chilis (Steak House). We went to all the speciality restaurants, going back a second and even a third time to some. Our favourites were the Fusion, Japanese and Steak House. The hotel and grounds were kept immaculate, my only complaint was the swimming pool. Some days it wasn't very clean although the water was tested daily. Swimming lengths was a bit of an obstacle course dodging leaves, a drinking staw, a plastic bottle, insects and scum. We could have used the facilities at the other Riu hotels nearby but we were more than happy at the Palace Riviera Maya. It was a pleasant walk into town, about 20 mins, where there are souvenir shops and the ferry terminal to Cozumel. Walk outside the hotel to the left about 5 mins and there is a small shopping centre. We didn't do any trips as we have been to Mexico before, but we did think the Thmson trips were expensive.

We feel tipping goes a long way to show how appreciative we are of their hard work. We enjoyed our room on the inside of the \"U\" shaped hotel.

We could look out & see the employees getting ready for the dinner crowd, the vendors setting up on some nights, etc. We liked our room location a lot!

I have stayed at all of these hotels. The Riu Palace Riv. Maya is the newest of these 3 \"Palace\" level hotels built in late 2005 and has everything for everyone. Any negative reviews you hear about this particular hotel are extremely far fetched and are probably the result of our tourists and not the hotel staff. The food on the property in both the buffets and a-la-carte restaurants is amazing - the best! The hotel staff - meaning the man that greets you at the door - the front counter staff - the cleaning staff - the restaurant staff - the bar staff - and the entertainment staff are by far the best staff you could assemble for a resort of this size. The nice thing about this resort is that even when the hotel is at 80% capacity you wouldn't even know it since the property is so large and there are a few giant pools, and huge beach space with tons of loungers to choose from. All in all this was by far the best vacation we have been on for our family of 4! Great for adults and kids! Having such a huge real estate footprint makes this even more enjoyable with much more to do and lots of space to stretch out. Room Number: 0059 Arrival: My wife and I and two children (ages 1 and 3) travelled to Playa del Carmen from Ottawa, Canada for a two week vacation in May 2011 staying at the Riu Palace Riv. Maya. We booked with Sunwing Vacations and from the moment we arrived at the hotel we recieved 5-star service. We asked if we could stay on the ground level of the hotel since we had two small children and they said no problem at all. We stayed in room 0059 facing the interior courtyard and fountains. Here is a tip: Even though we didn't pay for a \"superior junior suite\"; those that face the inside of the property - we upgraded at no additional cost - since they had the room. The hotel staff are nice this way! We had originally booked the cheaper \"junior suite\" facing the exterior of the property. Even though we were only in our room to sleep - upgrading to a superior jr. suite is worth it. Rooms: Our room was very nice and very clean, absolutely nothing bad to say about it. Did not see any bugs, did not have any bad odors - room was nice with a nice balcony - had a great view overlooking the beautiful gardens and fountains. The fact that this property only has 3 main levels for rooms makes it visually much nicer - since the palm trees block much of the structures - it's not like some hotels the are so tall they just overpower everything. Restaurants and Bars: There was a breakfast buffet with a beautiful choice of foods and the ability to sit inside or outside on the patio. For lunch we usually went to the area beside the pool/beach - it was fantastic too - lots of choice! And for dinner we would reserve an a la carte meal. There are a bunch of a la carte restaurants, such as steakhouse, traditional mexican, japanese, fusion, bolivian and they are all fantastic! Staff were extremely kind. Always going out of their way to accommodate our family with two young children. The bars were great, they had one in the lobby seen right when come through the front door, then another one off to the side in another room sort of like a games room, as well as a pool bar and an entertainment bar. One of the unique things about this property is that right before dinner you can go and sit in the courtyard around this huge water fountain and the staff would come to you and you could order a drink and just relax and watch the people before going into your reserved a la carte dinner. Beach/Pools/Grounds: Beautiful is an understatement in describing the grounds of this property - these gardens are so well manicured that you would need a magnifying glass to find an imperfection on a blade of grass or palm tree. Every single morning during our 2 week stay the grounds staff would come out and mop up the walkways made of tile. Then you would see grounds staff trimming palm trees etc. The grounds are so well maintained it's better than the nicest magazine cover you'll ever see. The two giant pools (side by side) are very nice - one has a vanashing edge in which you can sit on a ledge and overlook the larger pool down below. They have nice built in tiled loungers in the shallow ends on each side as well as many tables with stools right in the pool near the pool bar. The beach was nicely maintained - clean, with plenty of loungers to choose from. The only \"issue\" is the fact that vacationers play the \"reserve lounger game\" by placing a towel or book on a lounger and then never using it. This is no fault of the hotel staff - this is just a case of people being greedy and having no care for others. If you aren't down at the pool before 8am to reserve a spot - you won't get a good spot near the pool plain and simple. It's a game that goes on everywhere and needs a fair resolution. Activities on and off the Resort/Hotel: The animacion/entertainment staff are great - they are fun, energetic, they come out near the pool area for morning excersices around 10am each day and get people going - then they organize activities such as water volleyball or beach volleyball. They also have a little area beside the beach buffet (and steakhouse at night) for kids. It's not big but it's a little hut in which a child can go and draw and play inside and get out of the sun for a little while. The staff regularly included children in the entertainment in the evening before the main attraction events. Although my two children aged 1 and 3 were a little too young to participate in all these events - they still had a great time. The lobby was huge and a good place to meet and get ready to do something else like take a taxi to Playa del Carmen for a shopping trip. It cost about $10 US to get a taxi from the hotel to start of 5th avenue shopping street. There are other Riu hotels nearby in which you can use the facilities as well. If you \"stay\" at a Palace level hotel you can \"play\" at any Riu hotel. You can even hop on a bus on 5th avenue and drive north to Cancun (about 40 minutes) and hang out at the Palace Las Americas. All in all a fantastic resort - would highly recommend!

Although we love the RIU Palace Mexico we probably wouldn't return there after staying here... this resort just has it all! We toyed with going to Caribbean to maybe a Sandals resort, since we have been the Mexico several times, but we found the resorts to be so overpriced. We ended up booking the BEST room possible at the RIU for about 1/3 of the price of the basic room at the sandals in Antigua, and didn\u2019t regret it one bit. The perfect mix of people: couples, European, Canadian, American, young & older, families and groups. You can walk down the beach to Playa del Carmen or past all the resorts and eventually to deserted beach in the other direction. Service was impeccable! However there were 2 down sides: 1) was the wine not great and food we all felt was average. We went with another couple and we all felt the same way. 2) Was making dinner reservations was a pain and then they would claim the restaurant you wanted a reservation at was booked\u2026 when the evening you get in there are 6 tables out of 12 seated, that never made sense to me. Our favorites were Crystal, the Brazilian streak house, and the Mexican restaurant. The sushi was not really sushi on Japanese night in the buffet rest, all cooked fish. But alas, the resort is absolutely beautiful, the beach is a blast, smooth sand, perfect water temp, & it\u2019s always a trip watching the scene walking up and down the beach that\u2019s for sure. So just like house hunting it hard to get EVERYTHNG perfect in one place, if not impossible, but the RIU PRM comes very close and at a great price.

It wasn't too crowded while we were there, but the chairs would definitely go if you waited too long to get out there. The food was good. I would definitely recommend making reservations at each of the restaurants at the resort. They were all delicious. You have to be in the bar/lobby area between noon and 3pm to make reservations and you can make up to 2 at a time. I would also recommend being there at close to noon as possible so you can get the time and place you want. The fusion restaurant was fantastic, but also booked up quickly. We had to make 3 attempts to get a reservation there. It is about a 1/2hr walk to 5th avenue, which is where all the shopping is. It's a nice walk.

I don't know where to start in praising the entire experience here. The overall appearance of the resort is very grand and very clean. They had plenty of very dedicated staff and they were all very good at performing their individual role. There was always someone, somewhere who would be polishing or dusting to ensure the magnificent luster of the hotel was not only present not just in the morning but throughout the entire day. Drinks and food were absolutely delicious and plentiful and always served with a smile. They have several sit down restaurants requiring advance reservations which can be made at least a day in advance but the buffet was beyond adequate. Not at all the 'buffet' style restaurants which come to mind when you think 'buffet'. Dinner buffet came complete with a elaborate ice sculpture and several figure pieces carved from melons, coconuts and other types of food. The large selection ensures every palate can be pleased. The room was absolutely beautiful, crisp, and clean. We did have an room with a balcony overlooking the terrace and fountains. It can be a bit noisy so if you are looking for quiet you may want to stay in an outside room but we rather enjoyed briefly relaxing on the balcony overlooking the action below after a day at the beach or out on the town before preparing for the evening activities. Be sure to tip your maid and you will receive an adorable animal made from towels in appreciation or maybe to find your bed turned down with chocolate kisses on the corners. The beach area is one of the best in the area compared to the surrounding resorts. To the left, you can walk about 20 minutes to the main shopping district of Playa del Carmen or to the right you can walk for close to an hour past the resorts to plentiful beach, rocks and other all natural pleasures. The bi-level pool is very clean and has plenty of sunny spots as well as shady areas for those needing a break from the sun in addition to the swim-up pool bar. Entertainment is plentiful and by a great group of people who ALWAYS seem to be smiling and having fun meeting everyone. Dancing lessons, pool aerobics, horseshoes, volleyball, soccer, Spanish lessons, spa, pictures, children's activities, scuba lessons... you name it, they are doing it. At night, after the stage entertainment they head into town to some of the better popular clubs with anyone who cares to join them... and this gets you priority into the club. Whether you want to find a quiet spot on the beach to clear your head or are looking to socialize with other people, you will be able to find it here. The worst things I could say about our stay is: 1) they were doing work on the roof beginning around 9:00 or 10:00 in the morning (temporary and we shouldn't have been in the room anyways); 2) there were bathrooms to choose from and never any waiting though depending on where you were, it could be a distance to get to one though the resort isn't too big to where this presents much of an issue; and 3) the showers in the rooms could benefit from the installation of a light but were so very beautiful... all very, very minor and did not in anyway affect the experience we had. There was way too many good things to think about the bad. The details put into the design of this resort were amazing and by staying here you have access to the three other Riu resorts within walking distance for alternative nightlife or activities. We made a point to visit the other Riu resorts as well as the competition resorts in the area and there is honestly not much competition. We wanted to know if we picked the best or if there was other comparable options. The others are beautiful in their own way but had flaws in important areas such as the location both on the beach and distance from town or in the the staff, the food, or the cleanliness.

We went with friends and overall we enjoyed our trip, but probably won't go back. The resort is pretty and the beach is huge. Our room was a typical Riu room. Considering its not that old of a resort, the rooms are showing some age. The sink in our room had a huge crack in it and the bedding looked old and faded. Our room was in a horrible location-ground level on the end next to a walkway by the main buffet. The walls are paper thin and we could hear all of the noises any time night or day. we had a window that looked out onto the walkway that people were constantly banging on at night on their way past. Our mini fridge was never restocked while we were there but the room was always cleaned in the morning. The staff were not the friendliest we have ever encountered, except for the manager and the waiters at the Steak house, they were fantastic! thank you ! Breakfast and lunch buffets were good. Always found something to eat. They do not have enough loungers on the beach for the busy season, and a lot of them were broken anyway. One day a beach attnedant brought us chairs from the pool but without the cushions. He said we couldn't use them on the beach that day because \"the big boss\" was there. Coincedentally that was the day All of the staff couldn't do enough for you, and it was done with BIG smiles. It shouldn't take \"the Big Boss\" being there to get friendly service. We stayed last year at the RPM down the beach for New Years and the party there was much more like you would expect at a first class resort. This year at the RPRM it was lackluster at best. There were a lot of children running around day and night, more than we had expected. All in all we enjoyed ourselves but not because of the Riu and its staff.

This was my second RIU, stayed at Cancun Palace, Iberostar Paraisso Beach, Grand Oasis, ( senior trip for son) a couple others, all about 4 stars, never a 3.5. I don't get where the reviews complain about resort being too large, it wasn't.!!Compared to the Iberostar it is small. Staff was always trying to make your stay memorable. Beach service was that of a queen. It was the best all inclusive food we have had. NI can understand if u are a picky picky eater but my goodness, you can stand at pasta bar, pick your favorite noodles, point to any and every veggie, pick from 3 sauces and who could dare complain about this? breakfast was incredible. I dare you to travel to Destin , Fla with your teenagers for a week and pay for comparative room, food, entertainment. Let's visit that shall we? Comparable condo in Destin $ 2700-$3300 for 7 days, this isn't even with a pop tart.!! Evry night you hand your teens $50 each for about an hour of entertainment.' $ 250 start up groceries and this usually entails at least 2 more trips. $ 100.00 minimum for family of 4 to eat local seafood and that's only 2 drinks for Mom and Dad. Oh and who is gonna cook in your condo that has the graninte counter tops, and clean?? ( We get 2 suites in Mexico). I'm still at a bargain vacation from what is considered top notch condo and still this RIU is 5 x nicer! The grounds were beautiful! The beach beautiful! The dining outside and sitting outside at night was an extra plus for us. The lobby bar was fun, bar tenders eager to please and make my favorite drink from the famous Flora Bama , a bushwhacker . Sports bar was not beautiful but... Tv\"s with football playoffs, pool table, fooseball, , bartender who again was awesome. A frig with sandwiches for the late night pros. Pool was small in comparison to other visits at other hotels, this not a problem for me, I didnt come to such a beautiful beach to sit by a pool. The resort was full but pool never seemed crowded and chairs were available but u would have to reserve early if younprfermamprine spot. NNever a problem on the beach, all spots good. Our frig was filled every night with bottled water , soft drinks, requested tonic water and received next day, liqueur and beer as well. Beautiful is the one word I keep saying about this resort, second woukd be excellent service. I will return again soon. Contimplating what exactly my now 20&21 year old will think compared to the Iberostar. THey don't need Cancun but need comparable age kids to meet and have plenty of choices of entertainment.!!

Not the best view (view on the tennis court) but it was away from the entertainement and the pool so it was truly quiet! and that means a great deal to me. I didn't spend time in the room anyways and there are no rooms with view on the beach, so I really don't think it's worth it to pay more to have a better view unless you are the type that hangs out on the balcony of your room and want to see some people walking around...

It was amazing! You cannot put into words how nice this resort is. I was a little nervous because right before we left to go away there were a few bad reviews on stealing and cleanliness etc. This resort could not be more clean, there was someone at any hour somewhere cleaning. Also, we read another review on theft in their rooms, I would watch out more for other guests then I would the maids. We left stuff out at all different times of day and nothing was moved. It was a wonderful location in town also, if you leave the resort and go left, a 5 minute walk will bring you into a little shopping district. If you leave and go right about a 25 minute walk will bring you to 5th ave. ( a huge shopping district and restaurant area ) 100 percent safe to walk to day or night. No need for a cab at 10 dollars. Then there was the beach which held plenty of shade and sun for whatever you would like. We also only tried 2 restaurants ( chillis and Krystal ) I liked both, but the buffet and our waitress Sylvia were over the top. She was friendly and talkative every night and even noticed if we were not there, then asked where we were and if we had fun and enjoyed her country. Although there is a couple of things I think could be said. There was only Internet in the lobby and sometimes didn't even work. I like to get up in the morning and read the news and other things on the Internet and I would like to do so in the room when I wake up instead of walking to the lobby. The buffet was great but didn't change that much. I would have enjoyed more Mexican food, but there was alot of Americanized foods.

It tends to be a little more pricey (about $200 per person on average for a week) than others, but completely worth it. Keep in mind, compared to the lower cost mega resorts, there may not be as many children there, so if you have kids, look for the opportunities at the pool for them to make friends. Like every property, there are pros and cons, pros totally outweigh the cons, and in many cases, cons can be avoided by booking smart. Read on. Here are the pros: 1. Food was fabulous and the best we have had at any all inclusive in Mexico; we like the option to dine outside for breakfast lunch and dinner, and they offer this. 2. Beach was awesome! Crystal blue. Keep in mind its a manufactured beach as the property lost their beach in a hurricane (as did every resort down there) about 5 years ago. What makes this one different is the grove of palms that provide great cover for folks with fair skin, like our family. So if you don't get there at the crack of dawn to secure a palapa, there is definitely coverage available throughout the morning; this is not the case at many other local places. 3. Seashells!!! It's one of the few sand beaches on the Cancun side where beautiful shells roll up in the morning - look for lovely \"olives\" they are a coiled white shell that looks like it's been through a polishing machine - they are treasures, especially for the little ones. You have to be up at sunrise to be lucky enough to pocket a few on your trip. 4. Pool bar was great - keep in mind only the lobby bar serves top-shelf liquor, but all bars serve imported beer :-) Tip the bartender (even as little as 5 pesos per round, which is about a dollar) and beach servers and you will have a drink in hand for the entire stay! 5. The infinity pool was cool; our kids had a BLAST there, and they could swim up to the pool bar for a lime daiquiri and the bar tenders obliged them as though they were an adult patron - we liked that! The pool hours are also much longer each day than at the Riu Tucan property, just down the road. 6. The rooms - they were very nice. Decorated in an older style, and somewhat formal/ opulent. We didn't have a jacuzzi room, but honestly, we don't spend much time in the room, so it doesn't matter to us. 7. The lobby bar - WOW! Service there is incredible, and ambiance is awesome. Servers will remember you and come out to see you. 8. The spa was great!! We just LOVED the quaint ness and modern feel. 9. On Fridays, they have a tienda, where merchants come to sell their local goods - kids loved it. Look for the spray paint artist - he was awesome! 10. The property is situated very, very close to a small market area with gift shops and a little drugstore in case you need anything - we realized this the day before we left and wished we'd known it was just a hop down the road. If you do forget anything, you will likely find it there. 11. It's small compared to the \"mega resorts.\" There are advantages to this - you don't have thousands scrambling for reservations like at other places. You may also go to other resots in the Riu complex (there are at least three others right there in walking/ shuttle distance) to take advantage of nighttime entertainment and family activities at Riu Tucan. The cons: 1. The rooms nearest the lobby area are LOUD! Often, properties cannot confirm where you will be, and booking through a reputable provider like Funjet (whom we did not use, unfortunately), or upgrading to an ocean view (but read previous traveler reviews before booking, though, b/c the definition of \"ocean view\" differs from resort to resort) will assure you get a \"premium situated room\" which means not by an elevator or right off the lobby. Many low-rate vacation companies give you that low rate b/c your \"garden view\" will be of the massive water treatment plant and AC unit, 6 feet off your patio - seriously. Guess how I learned this??? 2. Keep in mind that the King Bed is two doubles pushed together, so if you are booking for four adults in a single room, one room with two double beds simply won't be comfortable for anyone - we experienced this first hand, unfortunately; live and learn, right. A double is an order of magnitude smaller than a queen. If you aren't a cuddler with your bed buddy, it's gonna be tight. OK, that's it - but given this was the first time there, and having not used a premium vacation company, we still had a great, great time. As I said, we don't spend much time in the room, but the sleeping arrangements did pose a problem, and the property isn't much help, so it took a day to get it right. Here are some tips to keep you and your property safe and secure when you travel out of the country: We have never had a problem with theft at any of the properties we stay at, BUT we are smart when we travel. I don't take a lot of expensive jewelry ANYWHERE - if I do, I am wearing it and wear it the entire time. I have used safes and have read horror stories, but have not had an issue to date over four trips. I use only credit cards there - never, ever a debit card. Sometimes we bury our passports within nested luggage, so a person will have to work very hard at HUGE risk of getting caught to find the things that they may expect to see in a safe. I don't carry a purse that is attention-grabbing; that is just not smart anywhere you go in a foreign country. I have plenty, I just leave them at home. I am kind to the staff there, and I pop back in periodically for random stuff (a break from the kids, more sunscreen, a book, whatever) and I always greet them and am respectful; even when I may be having an issue with the room - the folks taking care of the room are not in a position to help and aren't responsible and should not be treated as though they are. When you are in a country where everyone speaks a different language (except you), you never want to be on their bad side, so be a friendly traveler and you will find many people will help if you need it.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLove the Riu\u201d", "Author": "Lovetotravel53", "ReviewID": "UR123245896", "Content": "We stayed here October 2011 and it was beautiful.

I think when people write negative reviews about the staff at resorts they need to take a minute and remember that these people are not slaves and shouldn't be treated as such. They work very hard for very little and should be commended for some of the crap they put up with. I saw some extremely rude \"guests\" while there and they should be ashamed of themselves. We travel twice a year to all inclusives and have never once encountered a rude staff person. I guess if you treat them with respect they will treat you the same way.

The only thing that was a bit annoying was the smell in the rooms and the sensation that our sheets and clothes were wet due to the humidity, but I guess that's everywhere because after all it's by the beach. The grounds, pool and beach areas are super clean (we walked down the beach about a mile and could compare to other hotels that had sticks, shells and seaweed) and there's lots of palm trees if you prefer the shade, and lots of beach beds everywhere.

We had an early morning tour once where we had to order room service to be delivered at 6:30am. Even then, the worker was friendly, polite, and on time. Beyond the amazing staff, going all-inclusive was definitely a good choice. The food is wonderful - there was a complaint here that someone found it \"completely unacceptable\" to eat at the buffet two dinners in a row. What's unacceptable is such an elitist, groundless snub. Even at the buffet, the food had plenty of variety for all kinds of tastes, from pizza to paella to chocolate fondue, and it was my favorite place to eat! No expense is spared in an effort to cater to multiple tastes, and some dishes are absolutely gourmet. We also went to the Mexican and Japanese restaurants, and would recommend them both (though the Japanese one is rather cold, so bring a sweater). Food there was top-notch! Also, about the drinks - the bar makes cocktails a bit weak (wisely, as pools and strong liquor don't generally mix well), but the restaurants and buffet pull no punches when it comes to wines, champagnes, and even mixed drinks. Your glass will be refilled left and right, so keep an eye on it if you're not planning to leave a little tipsy. The only complaint I might have is that the beds are hard and the air conditioning keeps the room pretty cold at night. However, the front desk swiftly gave us extra blankets and pillows to help stay comfortable. The room was beautiful, and while the view was of a service corridor, we still got sunshine, bird songs, and a scenic view of the land, with only an occasionally chef or maid racing by. I had a tough time saying goodbye to this wonderful family of staff members. I would return in a heartbeat, and probably will.

We saw no unusual insects or rodents... one ant and one fly in 5 days, that was it... and there was no musty smell - nothing unexpected for the climate. This resort is rated a 5-star, but always consider you get what you pay for... we booked this vacation through cheapcaribbean.com and after discounting the cost of airfare, paid about $90 per night per person.

This was our first time at the RPRM, however, we have stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico twice prior. We found the resort beautiful. We had absolutely no complaints. The pool was beautiful, the beach is georgous, the food was just fine (like other reviews, we enjoyed Krystal the most). Never encountered any \"insects\" as I've read in other reviews, but we were on the third floor. The room was clean, well stocked, not as large as the one at Riu Palace Maya, but we had one king bed, not two pushed together as I also have read and a courtyard view. Last year we stayed at The Royal, Playa Del Carmen. It is very hard to compare. Yes, the Royal is fabulous -- the rooms are much nicer and we loved not having to make dinner reservations. We did not stay at the Royal this year because the cost was approximately $500 more per person. However, if you are a beach person, the beach is much nicer at Riu Rivera Maya. The best thing we found about the Royal is that you are right downtown almost on 5th Avenue. The RPRM is not adults only as is the Royal but we did not have any complaints in that regard as all children seemed to be well behaved. The service was wonderful -- absolutely no complaints whatsoever. I would go back to this resort as well as recommending it to friends. If money is not an issue when booking a vacation, then I'm sure there are much nicer resorts (Excellence Rivera Maya, Valentin, Iberostar Grand or Maroma Beach) from what I've read. Unfortunately, we we book a vacation the price is a major consideration. I feel we were fortunate not to have experienced any problems such as theft while on vacation. We did, however, have some issues with our flights with Delta but that is par for the course and we did arrive safe only four hours later than scheduled. Again, for the money, this resort is wonderful -- go and enjoy your vacation there. We have stayed at many other resorts in the same price range as RPRM and for the money, this one is tops. Best Travel did our transfers and I would recommend them. Our only problem during our stay was the weather and that is not the Resorts fault.

The hotel itself, the grounds, the beach, and the facilities themselves are carefully maintained and manicured (for the most part). One morning in the hotel's lobby we watched a guy on a tall stepladder dusting the individual crystals and lamps of a huge chandelier. It just sparkled! Another was doing the same thing to the elegant crystal column and wall sconces. Our room was beautifully appointed, and when my step-daughter sputtered about the uncomfortable sofa-bed, the hotel staff was only too happy to bring a rollaway with an eggcrate pad. Problem solved. We never could get the housekeeper to leave enough clean towels, though... it was like a room with a king bed should just get two of everything. A call to the front desk would have someone by within a few minutes, though, with additional bath linens. Someone came by and re-stocked the refrigerator each day, but it wasn't the housekeeper. Interestingly, though, the nightly turn-down service was mysteriously suspended after our second night. Do you suppose they plan it that way? A few things were frustrating during our stay. Overnight temperatures were dipping into the low-sixties (the high teens to around twenty, I guess, on the metric scale), and it seemed like the hotel would just cut-off the air conditioning system's central chiller during the night. We'd awaken during the night and the room would be not hot - but just humid, humid, humid - and regardless of the temperature set on the thermostat, there was just room-temperature air coming from the supplies. The air conditioning did funny, unexpected, things when we stayed down the beach at another property last summer. Maybe that's just the way they roll in Mexico. Who knows? When quizzed on the subject the gal at the front desk claimed she was unaware of any problems. The toilet in our room ran a slow trickle the entire time, there was neither any conditioned air supplied nor removed from the bathroom (I sensed all the rooms dealt with this, adding to the humidity issues), and the ice machine down the hall was haywire (but there was plenty of ice available for the asking in the nearby Sports Bar). During our stay, the hotel was having trouble with its internet service satellite uplink, too... as a result the wifi in the lobby would come and go (mostly go). Reliable (and free) service was available at a Starbucks about a quarter mile down the street out front. We managed to score reservations at the Brazilian, Fusion, and Mexican restaurants - and enjoyed great food and service in each. In the Brazilian place the staff learned my step-daughter was a vegetarian, and they went to the trouble to source a special entree more to her liking than the standard beef-, chicken-, pork-, turkey-, and sausage-on-a-skewer standard fare. I never got tired of eating breakfast, lunch, and even dinner on the buffets, either. I thought there was a good - and changing - variety of things to select from, but some of the standards appeared, and re-appeared, every day - and I suppose that after a period of time one could grow weary and critical of the routine. You sure had no excuse for getting up from the table hungry, however! We weren't especially early risers, though... and apparently some are, because if you appear at the pool or beach at nine o'clock, you'll marvel at how many of the loungers are \"taken\" already with a beach towel or a book standing by to hold and guard one's spot - with nary a human being in sight! I think this is a common occurrence though, and I don't know what the solution is, other than to send someone down early and play the same game. Some of the hotels in the area try to deter this practice; I think the Riu just looks the other way. The water in the pool was just chilly. A hardy few seemed not to mind. The water in the Caribbean was pleasant - but I wouldn't call it exactly warm. It was warm enough to get in on a warm and sunny day, but cool enough to say out-of on the cool and cloudy days. We didn't take advantage of the \"nightly entertainment;\" I don't even know where or when it took place. I won a round of Bingo one afternoon out at the pool, and brought home my winnings (some swag provided by a local nightspot). We saw lots of children, and the hotel has some staff members dedicated to keeping kids occupied - but I have no idea what they did with them. Many looked interminably bored down on the beach or out by the pool, but I never saw a single, portable, video game in a kid's hand. Here at home in the States, the two seem inseparable these days. All in all, I'd recommend the Riu Palace Riviera Maya to anyone inclined to do the all-inclusive thing. There are more costly choices available - and many less costly.

The Food was of superb quality and enough variation to please everyone, i would recommend booking the Steak Restaurant as the meal and the service there was top class, we also booked the Brazilian restaurant which was ok. Men do not have to wear long trousers and shirts with collars in the evenings as this rule is not enforced and there were many men wearing shorts and T Shirts for evening dinner. The whole staff can not do enough for you and there attitude is \"nothing you require is too much for them\" it was really refreshing to have such a great quality of service and this goes down to the standard set at the Riu Hotel as well as the Mexican people in general, who are fantastic. The New Year celebrations were OK but we are used to the UK style so it was slightly different but we enjoyed it and the Champagne was flowing. My only issue was the Sunbeds around the swimming pool which were nearly all taken by people reserving them with towels or flip flops by 6.00 am and in some cases the Night before !!!!!!! when the directive is supposed to be \"No beds to be reserved before 7am\" but we just went onto the Beach which was lovely and where the Temp of the Sea was much warmer than the Pool anyway and where there were loads of available beds early but which did get taken very quickly after breakfast had finished. My recommendation to anyone staying who wants a pool sun bed is just throw the flip flops and books off and take them, as 90% of the time the people do not use them anyway and the Americans have to understand other people do !!

Someone was routinely puking in a nearby room (not my kids I checked) and laundry carts racing down the hallway. It was noisy enough to either to prevent you from falling asleep or keep you awake after a late-night trip to the bathroom. This was different, and much noisier, than the last time we stayed years ago. What could RIU easily do to improve the hotel: They should assign staff or retrain them while cleaning throughout the day. It was evident for example, the staff was told to police the tables, pick up glasses and wipe them down. If something had fallen on the floor like a napkin or straw it often would be there until the next morning when the cleaning ARMY would get it. They are task oriented instead of job oriented like someone would be in the States. Put in WiFi throughout the hotel including the pool area and make it handle the load. This is probably a half a dozen access points or so and a decent connection. The Internet was free in the lobby and it didn\u2019t appear anything was blocked but it wasn\u2019t fast enough. I was able to connect a corporate VPN (Cisco 5.0 client) between about Midnight and 7AM. At most other times the 3mb X 500kb connection was overloaded with \u2018Face time\u2019 video connections and other traffic.

The water is ok to drink on all the restaurants and the buffet. My partner has a sensitive stomach and she survived our trip without any issues. Do not drink the water out of the faucet. The meats served at Rodizio was way better in my opinion compared to the steakhouse. Don't expect steak here to taste like steak in the U.S. because it's just different. Yashima was just ok for us. As much as people criticize Don Manolos which is the buffet, it's actually pretty good and offers tons of choices for breakfast and dinner. For lunch, we went to Chili's which wasn't too bad at all and offered a lot of choices - there were meats and seafood everyday and you can drown in the chips and fresh guacamole and all the alcohol you can drink. We didn't have a problem with the size of the cups either - I think I would get so sick if I had them make me a drink in a large cup. Service is just phenomenal - they take very good care of you here and it is difficult to come back home and get used to cooking for yourself again. Many thanks to Damian for treating us so well during our meals at Don Manolos and Vanessa for getting us reservations ahead of time. Internet Access: It was a pain to use the internet because it is only available in the lobby although it still made me laugh at the number of young kids and some adults who would park themselves on one of the couches and surf the internet all day - amazing to me since we are technically in paradise and yet you'd rather stay inside and surf the internet. It just doesn't make sense. There is an internet kiosk in the sports bar but you have to pay to use it if you did not bring any devices with you. Room/Room Service: We had a third floor room, close to the elevators that faced the ocean so we could see the ocean from our sliding glass window/door. Thanks to Miriam for arranging that for us. The bed was a true king size bed and we slept well each night. The entire hotel is made up of marble and yes, sound does travel but it wasn't terrible for us. All the noise from the courtyard died down around 11pm each night. The A/C won't kick on if you open the sliding glass door, they even mention this in the Riu directory, there is a ceiling fan that helps distribute the cool air but it is humid and I think this is where the smell that most people describe is coming from but it didn't bother us - I even brought some candles and didn't use it. I did notice that if you stop moving and lay down in bed that you do cool down pretty quick. We only had to order room service once which was during the New Years Eve because all the ice machines were empty. I think that most items that can be ordered on room service is available also in the Sports bar. Beach, Pool, Swim up bar, service: The beach and pool are all cleaned by an army of workers everyday. I watched the sun rise 3 different times while I was there and saw these people clean up, pickup, arrange the loungers every day. The pool was cleaned every evening and I am glad they do, a lot of parents leave their kids unsupervised playing in the area near the swim up bar where they order non-alcoholic drinks left and right and they spill drinks in the pool. We only used the swim up bar once and swam in the infinity pool once and didn't want to do it again after we saw the number of kids who goofed around in the pool the entire time. The waiters in the area were wonderful and very attentive. Our number 1 complaint are the smokers - their smelly cigarette smoke would waft in whatever direction the wind was blowing and it ruins the experience for us non-smokers. This and the unsupervised kids were really the deal breakers for us. We've both decided that we will find an adult only place that does not allow smokers next time. This also prevented us from using and visiting the pool/beach area because the one day that we did try it - we would be overwhelmed by the smell of cigarette smoke while sitting down quietly reading a book. I wish Riu would create a specific smoking area and have a separate pool for the kids under the age of 16. Another major irritation are the salespeople who would try and sell you items like jewelry, etc while you are quietly laying down in your lounger at the beach. This was another point of major irritation for us. People that want to sell you stuff accost you on 5th Ave, the Playa Del Carmen shopping area, the area where you catch the ferry to Cozumel, everywhere! We even had one sleazy guy in the shopping are pretend that he waited on us in one of the restaurants in Riu. We couldn't walk fast enough away from him. This is where the wrist bands are used against you because they know what resort you are from based on the wrist band colors. Indoor bars, fridge, alcohol/wine quality: Top shelf liquor will not be used in your drinks unless you ask for it. I don't drink and didn't really enjoy the non-alcoholic drinks they offered so I stuck with 7-up and lime. The fridge inside the rooms had water, 7-up, orange soda, and Dos Equis beer - housekeeping refills these items as you use them. Things to do: There is free intro to scuba diving at the pool everyday, workout classes at the pool, kayaking, there is an entertainment crew that does different activities during the day and night to mention a few - we skipped these and decided to take advantage of rising early to miss the crowds. The activity vendors near the hotel make it a point to make sure that jet skiing, parasailing, windsurfing etc are all within close viewing distance of the beach area which really is pretty annoying but they probably do it to coax you to sign up so you can't help but wish for red flag days which means no traffic on the water. Overall - it was a great trip. We did quite a few tours instead of hanging out at the beach. Outside of the hotel walls - it is non-stop sales, you get accosted left and right and by the time you leave and go back to the airport you hear people saying again and again that they don't have any more money. Although going big and all inclusive was a good way to go for our first time experience, next time we definitely want it to be quite a bit more intimate, no smoking and adults only.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newark DE", "Title": "\u201cA delightful stay!\u201d", "Author": "IMBANewarkDE", "ReviewID": "UR122416101", "Content": "Our family of four stayed at the RPRM over the Christmas holiday. We booked through Apple, so transfers from Cancun were prepaid and relatively painless. NO problems at check-in. A fruity drink was served while we got our wristbands. One room was not ready (4:30 pm), but the bags were delivered to the adjoining room quickly. We had an outer room, pretty quiet for the most part. We did experience the musty smell, but this is a tropical locale. After a couple days you don\u2019t even notice it. Our junior suite was spacious, VERY CLEAN, and beds were comfortable. The bathroom had a separate niche for toilet and bidet. The shower is in a deep tub which may create difficulties for older folks, and it is also quite dark. The mini bar was well stocked, and always replaced. We had a problem with the air conditioning in one of the rooms, but it was always addressed quickly with a call to the front desk. They called from the front desk after maintenance visited to ask if the problem had been corrected. Pool was nice, not always loud and annoying with games and screaming people that you see at some resorts. Beach is crowded, but we never had a hard time finding a lounger. The guests from the Riu resort across the street have no access to the beach, so they come across to the RPRM, which is one reason for so many people. Drinks are readily available at the pool and beach. Servers are busy, busy, busy. Minor complaints about the beach: the constant presence of jet-skis, and vendors trying to get you to parasail, etc. I hate the noise and smell of the two-stroke engines. I would much rather hear the sound of the waves\u2026 would love to find the resort that REJECTS these beasts! We took a 2.5 hour snorkeling trip from the beach; it was better than leaving the resort to travel to a snorkeling destination for the day. Playa Del Carmen is about 20 \u2013 30 minutes up the beach on foot. You can take a cab for about $7. We ate at all the restaurants, and we liked them all because of the variety offered. The property is well staffed and clean. I cannot say enough about the service and the graciousness of all the staff members. Servers, bartenders, maids, EVERYONE is pleasant and accommodating.

My husband, family, and friends (11 of us in all) stayed at the RPRM in October 2011. This was our third stay and it was still awesome. To break it all down I will start with the rooms. Rooms: We learned very quickly to take air fresheners to combat the moldy smell. You must remember that you are staying in a very humid place and you have to accomodate yourself to the environment. We had a standard room that overlooked the outer side of the resort. The view didn't bother us, we weren't in the room that often. The bed was more than comfortable, slept like a baby most nights. Pool: Yes, we are those people that put down towels early. We never had trouble getting our \"usual chairs\", even for 11 people. The only negative about the pool is people throwing their straws and other trash in the water, but you will always find ignorant people! Drink service at the pool was excellent. Never had an empty glass!!! Food: Breakfast was excellent every morning. Lunch was also very good. We ate at 3 of the specialty restaurants, Krystal, Japanese, and the Steakhouse. Our favorite was the Japanese. The night we ate at the Steakhouse was my sister's birthday. They made a huge deal out of it, sang and even gave her a birthday cake!! The only one we will not go back to is Krystal. We did not like it, but the best thing about that was we just walked on over to the buffet! So problem was solved. All in all we loved the RIU and would go back again! To get to from the airport I recommend Cancun Transfers. It is a private transfer and worth every penny!!!", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westmont, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "Cheryl N", "ReviewID": "UR122334722", "Content": "The Riu Palace Riviera Maya is a beautiful resort. It is very clean and the staff is excellent. My complaints are minor but worth sharing. I have stayed at the Riu Ochos Rios in Jamaica 5 years ago which is why I choose another Riu resort. I was suprised that the food in Mexico wasn't as good as the other Riu I stayed at. We had undercooked seafood a couple times which forced my husband to induce vomiting so that he wouldn't get food poisoning. I liked that at this resort you made reservations between 12-3pm and you could book two restaurants a day. Other than the under cooked seafood the other food was pretty good. I was disappointed that the Nachos were stale and the cheese tasted like plastic. I really was expecting the nachos in mexico to be good. They were good in Jamaica? Chili's was our favorite restaurant. We went there twice and had the filet and lobster tail. The fusion restaurant sea bass was excellent up until the part of the bass that was under cooked. I did not like the mexican restaurant and my stomach didn't either. The brazillan steakhouse was pretty good too. The sports bar was the best mainly because of Victor and Pancho. We had many fun nights there. We stayed 12/8/11 to 12/13/11 and the weather wasn't the best. The pool was cold but you got used to it pretty quickly if you just jumped in. There was a gross odor by the pool bar and by the theatre bar that I had to keep away from because it was so overpowering. Our room was pretty standard, I did book the Junior Superior Suite, which I expected a better view but instead had a view of Chilis, but it wasn't a big deal, I just didn't want to be by the theatre. The bed was hard and my husband and I had back pain for the whole vacation. I've read some other reviews after going here and saw that you could request a matress pad, I wish I would have know that. It was hard to sleep because the doors slammed shut in the hallways and would be so loud that it woke me up. The light outside our door fell off the wall in the middle of the night and woke me up. One morning there was no hot water to shower, I blame all the weddings that were going on that weekend for that. And the water was completely shut off for a couple minutes which was just weird. I know this sounds like a lot of complaints but we still had a great time, we only wished the bed was more comfortable and that we wouldn't have experienced the undercooked food. One more thing, we booked through expedia and also booked our airport transfer through expedia. Expedia uses Best Day Tours for the airport transfers and tours. Our airport transfer went smoothly but I would not book any tours through Best Day Tours. I would recommend reading some reviews about best day tours before you book any tours with them. If you book the transportation through expedia you will have to meet with Best Day to get your return voucher and they will try to book their tours with you.

We had to use the light from our phones to navigate the halls and lobby for our early morning departure. The resort is extremely crowded not relaxing by any means and there is absolutely no privacy. The majority of the guests are well beyond intoxicated which made for some extremely interesting stories. The rooms and halls smell like they have been cleaned with a dirty mop and there is also an underlying smell of mold from the wood in the rooms and hall.

First, the good. The hotel was amazingly clean. Armies of workers out cleaning most of the day. Grounds very nicely kept. If you are obsessive on clean, this is your hotel. Also, I thought the food was very much better than the last all-inclusive I stayed at, at least in the specialty restaurants. More on these later. Service was better in the restaurants than other all inclusives. Now the problems. There is not internet service in the rooms or poolside. It is available in the lobby only. What an inconvenience to have to come down to the lobby to check your email. I read they plan to make internet access available in the rooms next year at an extra charge. Completely unacceptable. FREE internet access in rooms and poolside is the STANDARD, and anything less is completely unacceptable for a resort. Our biggest problem at this hotel was the bed. The king size beds here are two double beds pushed together! No kidding! Complete with a crack in the middle that you cannot lay across. If I wanted to sleep in a separate bed than my wife, I would have booked a room with two double beds. This forces a couple to sleep on one side, essentially in a double bed. (Not a queen, but a double.) We felt cramped on it and had to constantly push together so my wife would not have to lay on the uncomfortable crack between the two beds. What kind of idiot thought this would be a good idea? I looked in the photo book in the room at all the luxurious RIU properties around the world, to find pictures of the same pushed together double beds in all their properties. Enough for me to never stay at an RIU property again. How about this one: no exhaust fans in the bathrooms. When nature called, I had to go down to one of the three public bathrooms to avoid smelling up the room. Remember the excessively clean comment earlier? One morning at 7 AM I went to all three public mens rooms to find each one opened up with female workers inside hosing them down with power washers - leaving no facilities for guests needing to use one of them. I finally found a separate handicapped bathroom that was being cleaned, with no one was inside so I locked the door and went amidst the cleaning equipment. Why clean every single public restroom in the facility at the same time? This seems to be the norm in the area, but when you arrive, you are fitted with a plastic wristband that cannot be removed, like the type you get in a hospital. This is to identify you as a hotel guest. It was annoying to have to wear a wristband you could not remove for your entire visit. Have not had to do this at other all-inclusives I've stayed at. The restaurant situation is horrible. They have a buffet restaurant that does not require reservations. All the other restaurants require a reservation. Try to get one. Here's what happened to us: We arrived at 8:30 PM on Monday night. We were staying until Friday morning - 4 nights. When we got settled in our room we knew we had to go the buffet that night. It was OK, but we are not buffet people. We were told at check in that you go the the lobby bar area between 12 Noon and 3 PM to make your dinner reservations, and that you can reserve dinners for two different nights, up to 3 days out. The specialty restaurants have two seatings per evening, 7 PM and 8:45 PM. We went in at about 1:15 that next day (Tuesday) to make dinner reservations. We were told there were NO RESERVATIONS available at any restaurant that evening! We would have to eat the buffet again that night. HOW COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE !! We were also told that there were only 2 choices available for Wednesday, and 3 choices available for Thursday. We had heard the best restaurant there was called Krystal. We asked about this, and were told \"For Krystal, you have to be here right at Noon, and then you can only book it for 3 nights in advance.\" If we came back tomorrow at noon, you might get it for Friday night\" Considering Thursday was our last night, we told her that was unacceptable, but just got a \"sorry.\" At the Excellence resort we stayed at during our last all-inclusive visit, you went to any restaurant you wanted, any time you wanted, no reservation necessary. How much better is that than this sorry excuse of a guest dining plan? Why would anyone choose the RIU with this system in place? I certainly won't. P.S. That evening, we went to Krystal at 8:45 and asked the head waiter if it would be possible to get us in, since we couldn't book a reservation during our entire stay. He had us wait outside until 9 PM in case there was a no show. Fortunately, there was one no show, so he got us in, and it was excellent. Nice food, Bizarre and unacceptable system.

First the con's ( better to finish with a positive so please read the entire review): The resort, shaped in a letter \"U\" has a hotel type layout with central hallways. This results in quite a bit of noise in your room. It is not uncommon to hear suitcases being pulled down the hallways at 07:00 am or hear the people above you. The doors on each room close with a very loud bang that will wake you up. The beds are very firm but not as bad as some reviews claim. The sheets did seem to get a bit moist at night due to the rubber sheet on top of the mattress. I fixed this by taking the extra blanket from the closet and sleeping on top of that. There is no pillow menu and the pillows supplied are very flat and hard for my liking. The layout also means there are very few ocean view suites. Most of the rooms face the adjoining resorts on either side which are quite close. Not a particularly good view to enjoy while sitting out on your balcony. You can upgrade to a room facing the interior of the \"U\" which of course is the pools, fountains etc. If a ocean front room is very important to you then ask for third floor only at the ends of the open \"U\". The 4 a la carte restaurants are not that good. We were quite disappointed in the quality and choice in each of the speciality restaurants compared to the Imperial Valentine or the Royal Playa Del Carmen . Another thorn in our side was the fact you have to reserve your restaurant between certain hours---impossible to do if you are out shopping or on tours. The entertainment shows were okay but the entertainment group were very very good at interacting with the crowd and getting people involved. When the nightly shows end , thre resort pretty much goes to bed. ( 11:00p.m.) This is due to the number of children etc. If you are into more night life then you will need to walk into PDC or take in the disco at the other RIU property. Twice we noticed the same employee ( capitan) drinking at the resort--once quite intoxicated and a bit rude. Whether he was still on shift or finished working we felt they should not be drinking at the resort. Now for the positives and there are a lot of them; We have visited half a dozen different resorts in the PDC area and without a doubt this one has the best buffets. Plenty of variety every night. Lobster tails and enormous shrimp, whole roasted turkey and hams, pasta both hot and cold of every kind, wonderful soups. Fine eating is on the top of our list when travelling and the buffets here are excellent. The service in this resort is top notch. All employees truly seem eager to please you and make you feel welcome. Very friendly staff and hard working. The beach is wide and beautiful with enough chairs for everyone. Lots of daily activities for everyone and as I stated eariler, the entertainment staff get you motivated. There is a dive shop ( Scuba Caribe) on site and are excellent. The diving is not quite as good as Cozumel but we did not want to have to catch the ferry across 4 days in row. I did 8 dives and found them very professional and safe. The grounds and buildings are constantly being cleaned and tidy. We liked the proximity of the resort to PDC--only a relaxing 15 mins walk on the beach into town. We were never once approached by any time-share reps from the resorts---this was a nice bonus as some other resorts can be very pushy on their time shares. This resort really takes good care of the children who are travelling with the parents. TO RECAP: I would recommend this resort to anyone. We all felt it deserved a 4.5 star rating. Dining: 2.5 stars Buffet: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Drinks: 5 stars Rooms: 3.5 stars Beach/location:5 stars Entertainment: 4 stars In closing I would like to say a special thanks to Victor in the Sports Bar, Rosario, Wilbert,Herbert in the buffets and to Daniel in the Krystal Restaurant. These 5 people went above and beyond in service and made our trip truly enjoyable. Should you decide to visit the RIU Maya Palce please look for these 5 great people.

Arrived on November 11 and with a private shuttle to the hotel, only way to go with no stops. The check in was handled efficiently and we were in our room quickly. We were pleasantly surprised with our upgrade to a suite near the pool. As always the tropics give off a musty smell but a few candles took care of the problem. Our suite was above and beyond what we expected. We made reservations for all specialty restaurants from home so this made it easy. We ate at the dinner buffet twice. Each time there was plenty to choose from and we were not disappointed. We ate breakfast in the buffet and had a great variety to choose from. Cappuccino was excellent as well as the Mimosas. The Chili\u2019s restaurant was our lunch destination and very good \u2013 plenty of choices. This time of year the loungers were abundant both by the pool and beach. The serve staff was fantastic and was always there to fetch a cool drink. Traveling in November vs. our usual April was a nice change.

The same wonderful service remains at RPRM and the hotel is a great value if you price shop for the perfect deal. Most areas of the hotel are spotless and maintained daily. We love this hotel and feel comfortable in most areas. What does need a mention, we noticed this year that it appears staff is not assigned to cleaning the pool area floors, chairs and tables. In the past, many staff spent a few hours each morning ensuring the pool area was clean for the guest. Using power washers on the floor and chairs. This year, the floors around the pool area were very dirty and the chairs sometimes were covered with spilled drinks for many days. There was a general uncleanly appearance around the pool area. Papers, glasses sand and many of the umbrellas are broken and the chair mats are worn out. RPMR, it is time to start paying more concentrated effort in the pool area. The area could be spruced up quickly with some new mats, umbrellas and daily floor cleaning. Don\u2019t let this place go, you have a gem.

This resort is very luxurious, with beautiful buildings and well manicured and maintained surroundings. The lobby is grand with crystal chandeliers, marble floors and many places to sit, have a drink and use the free internet. The resport is not overly large, and it is maybe a 5 minute walk (at a very leisurely pace) from the front lobby to the beach. The beach is outstanding - the sand is soft (as compared to other locations in the Riviera Maya where there is more coral in the sand), and it is very wide (from property to the water) with plenty of loungers. Although there are no palapas, there are many palm trees which allow you to enjoy sun and shade with just a few shifts of your lounger over the course of the day. We never used the pool, but it looked absolutley gorgeous with an infinity pool and a large main pool area as well. There is no bar at the beach, but the pool bar is close by and there is waiter service to the loungers most of the time. Rooms: The rooms were fine, nothing spectacular, but we were only in there to change and sleep. We were three in one room, and the staff went our of there way to set us up as comfortably as possible. One nice thing in the rooms is the self serve bottles of alcohol (all top shelf) as well as the well stocked bar fridge (beer, pop and bottled water). Made for a nice little cocktail bar while we changed from beach wear to dinner wear! We had a basic suite, but If staying there again I would ask for garden view and enjoy the balcony a bit more. Restaurants: We had breakfast and dinner every night in the main buffet - which was outstanding! Lots of variety and excellent quality. We ate out on the restaurant's terrace and enjoyed the view, and for supper, enjoyed the live music. We did try a couple of the a la cartes, but we were not overly impressed. Lunch time found us every day at Chili's - a short meander from our sun beds on the beach. The gym was small, but adequate with well maintained equipment, water and towels. One of the things that stood out for me at this resort was the quality of service and outstanding staff that work there. I did not come across one person who did appear to truly enjoy their job and take pride in what they do.

There is also a disco at the Riu Tequila for those that are looking for a little more excitement in the evening. As well, the RPRM is a very short stroll from Playa Del Carmen - we actually went 3 times in the evening (when it had cooled down) before dinner. Great shopping, and lots of fun. We would walk there (15 minutes) and take a taxi back ($7USD). All in all, it was a wonderful week.

Miriam welcomed us with a warm smile and checked us in with efficiency and advised us that we had been upgraded. (second time at this resort and third stay at a Riu resort property.) We had had a long flight and what seemed like a long process to get to the resort because of inconsiderate booze hounds hopping off and on the bus to use the bathroom so upon arrival Miriam's professionalism and sunny disposition took some of the edge off. Upon arrival at our room (1108) we quickly realized that the location of our room was a premium one which was overlooking the fountains and in close proximity to the pool and beach and a lovely view. We dropped our luggage and went to the buffet for supper and then out the courtyard to enjoy the music the band was playing and the spectacular view of the stars. Taking in our surroundings we instantly recognized what had brought us back a second time. Location location location, beautiful immaculate grounds, excellent food and staff who really enjoy people and making your holiday special. We were quickly served and we recognized many of the staff from the previous year. We received a warm welcome from dedicated hard working staff such as Chano, Marlene, Nicko, Nickolas, Maury and Lesther to name a few. We feel what makes this particular Riu resort property such a success is their recruitment of hard working personable staff such as some of the ones we have mentioned. More important though is retaining these staff year to year so we were pleased to see the majority of staff that we really enjoyed from last year were still there. Every day at the RPRM felt like a day in paradise between the natural beautiful surroundings of the resort, the hard working personable staff, the excellent food and the weather. We have been to quite a few resorts in the Mayan Riviera and we feel that this particular resort must have one of the best recruiting systems because the staff not only have excellent people skills but are very good at what their particular job function is. From the cooks to the line staff at the buffets to the staff at the specialty restaurants to the maids. We found the food both at the specialty restaurants and the buffets were even better than last year. The entertainment team and the shows were very entertaining and we did not feel the need to go to Playa Del Carmen as this resort makes a great effort to provide various entertainment options in addition to the nightly shows. Even though we had seen most of the shows for the second time this year there had been some tinkering and changes made to make it very entertaining this time around. I would not pay any attention to the negative reviews.

We had dinner both at the speciality restaurants and the main buffett. Our top choices were the Japanese and Krystal restaurants, however the buffett had everything to choose from. We decide to cancel our last speciality restaurant for the buffett. Close to other Riu hotels, and town. Beach was very nice, not a problem getting beach chairs, however getting a spot around the pool could be trying at times. I have been to many all inclusives, Riu ranks along the best of them.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Methuen, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAgain RIU is the way to go!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Bluefxst", "ReviewID": "UR120749665", "Content": "Got back last night from a 6 day stay at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya.

I have been to at least twelve other all inclusive resorts and can say this (buffet) food was by far the best of them all. We did not try the on site restaurants because we were with two guests that booked the RIU Palace Mexico and were not allowed to make restaurant reservations, but they could do and use every other amenity, so we chose the dinner buffets to eat together. The staff were all friendly helpful and smiling...Not sure how they pull off the smiles all day :) The beach was beautiful with more than enough beach chairs and the pool was huge and well kept. There was nothing the staff would not do, or get done for you. I highly recommend this resort, and all the other high end RIU's. $7 (USD) taxi fare to Playa del Carmen is very much worth it....Playa is a safe and extremely fun place to go.....PS, I do have to say the mattress's were very firm and not what I am used to sleeping on, so a good nights sleep wasn't an option for me...my wife slept like a rock tho", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cTwice in Riu Palace Riviera Maya\u201d", "Author": "lruizm", "ReviewID": "UR120711342", "Content": "This was my 2nd time in Riu Palace Riviera Maya. First time was this last August 2011 with my family and last time was from October 12 to October 19 with my girl friend who lives in Europe. I made the most extensive research to find a hotel that would suit all of my needs, but unfortunately I couldnt find it, so I finished up in this beautiful hotel in Playacar that I already knew. I was looking for a hotel with the following: walking distance from the city beach nice rooms good food jacuzzi big pools no rocks on the beach all inclusive availability of kayak, windsurf, snorkel or whatever less than 20,000 pesos for 6 nights good service medium sized hotel no kids not a couples focused hotel Now if you have read the reviews and looked for hotels you know that you will not find all of the above. There's no way you'll find a good all inclusive adult not for couples hotel near the city for that price! Riu Palace was a good choice, I knew it already, it is not very big, the reception is nice... service in reception is awesome when you make the check in, for everything else it kind of sucks big time. The weather was a huge problem the second time I went because it was raining like hell all the time so there was absolutely nothing to do but to sit down in the bar and drink. Here's a list of pros and cons for you :) PROS food the first time was not very good, just average... but this last time was VERY VERY VERY GOOD. buffet is kind of always the same but i didnt care, food has very good. Specialty restaurants all good. Botafogo de Brazilian is good but food is just too much! Japanese is good, but if you're used to mexican sushi you'll find it kind of normal, nothing interesting. Steak House Chilis is normal good, not average but slightly better than average. Kristal is very good, interesting and unusual menu but very good. Mexican Restaurant is exceptional! This is true mexican food, if you dont like it, you do not like mexican food! and well Don Manolo Buffet for dinner is nice too, they serve different food for dinner every night. I didnt go to the restaurants the first time so I dont know if they were better now or not. Beach is incredible, its color is beautiful and water is warm transparent with fish that you can see even if you do not snorkel! shows at night are fine, youll have a good laugh you can go to COCOBONGO with people from the hotel :D it was GREAT! bars everywhere! room was nice, good size, free bottles of vodka, tequila, brandy and rum. Also water, 7up, pepsi, etc. 24 hour room service first time the lady who cleaned the room was incredible, everything so neat and made towel animals and well attention was awesome. the second time was not good at all. hotel is very clean 2 changes of towels a day kayak, windsurf, snorkel, tennis, etc for sports for free! you can use all of the Riu in Playa and Cancun!!! beach is soooo big! LOCATION IS EXCELLENT, 10-15 minute walk to playa del carmen's 5th avenue (downtown) if the weather is nice, entertainment is great, beach, bars, and everything are perfect CONTRA good service is of luck... some of the servers treat you perfectly and ask you if everythings okay and give you drink or food information, some others do not. I didnt tip anyone though... second time rained almost all of my trip and you could ask for umbrellas in reception, but i didn't know that! when i went to ask for one, they were all gone. drinks by the pool are small parts of the hotel have leaks so when it rains it gets wet 2nd time cleaning was terrible, even if i was staying in a better room. we asked several times to change a blanket and didnt do it until we got mad reception service is terrible. we stayed for one more night but apparently they do not make reservations themselves so they had to call someone to know if there was availability in the hotel. We specifically asked for a room that would be available for 2 more nights so that we could make a late check-out. They told us that they could only tell us if we could make a late check out until the same day we left, and that it could be until 3pm. They gave us until 2pm. We had to call at least 5 times and every time it was with someone different and had to explain everything all over again. second time i went was raining all the time and there was nothing to do, one day they projected movies in the theater but there were no servers, so you couldnt drink anything. palm trees are kind of far from the sea, so if you want shade, you will not be very close from the sea. first time the food was just average dont try the pastries they do not specify that room service orders are for 2 people, so if you ask for breakfast dont order a lot because we ordered 2 of everything and we had food for like 4-5 people! if you want to buy something, dont buy them from the guys that go to the hotel, just head one day to playa and ask for different prices. nightlife doesnt exist in this hotel, after 11pm you can only be at the bar and after 12 just at the sports bar. They turn the lights off the theater even if youre there if it rains the rooms get very humid I think thats about it... overall i had great experiences both times. I wish the sun would have been out the second time, but it was rainy rainy until the last two days, so i couldnt really profit as the first time. The hotel is beautiful and rooms are spicey. I have stayed in the garden view and the hotel view, room sizes were the same but obviously the hotel view is better, and depending on the room you get, maybe you can even see the ocean like i did without paying more for an ocean view :) If you dont know where to go, Riu is a good option, the hotel is nice and food goes from average to great! service could get a little better, but also it could be that me and my friend look young and therefore didnt treat us as good as wed liked. Beach is amazing and I know for sure that Playacars beach is the most beautiful of Riviera Maya. If you can, dont take the tours as they are very expensive, you can reach everything by car or by colectivo for only 20 pesos. It is very close from Playa del Carmen and late shows are fun. I like the Riu and I dont think ill go to a different hotel if I go back to an all inclusive in Playa :) Before my first time at Riu, I used to worked in the Mayan Riviera during the summer, so if you have any question regarding anything, I will be very pleased to help you! Also staying in Riviera Maya is VERY expensive, so the hotel is expensive, but if you compare it to all of the others of the same price, I think this one wins in every aspect!", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton Junction, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNovember 2012 Visit\u201d", "Author": "Lancastersmail", "ReviewID": "UR120674466", "Content": "We travel normally to Aruba (39 Trips) and other caribbean destinations, and it has been a few years since travel to Cancun area.

Outbound airport was easy checkin, USA departures are in a newer terminal #3 with loads of shopping and dining prior to flight. Do allow 2 hours upon arrival.

Lunches were in a dining facility or on the beach burgers, etc... Entertainment nightly was so-so, but we always retired before 10pm!

There was rum, vodka, tequila and brandy in the suite plus 24 hour roomservice. Checkin was swift and friendly; all service people were incredibly friendly. We were told that most newer resorts had their own chlorination water facilities. We heard no guests grumbling about \"The Revenge\".....But, we did take Pepto Bismol twice daily and had other drugs if we had need; one should assume you might get this bug and why risk your trip?!

This was not my first time in playa (which i love) but my first time staying at a RIU resort. Overall, i was extremely impressed with everything the hotel had to offer! some of the highlites were: 1) staff- they were so attentative and on point at all times! if your drink was low at the pool, they were there within a minute to get you a new one. All very friendly and most of them remembered your favorite drinks and didn't even need to ask what you wanted. the lobby staff and restaurant waiters were all so friendly as well. by the end of the week, you feel sad to leave the people who made your trip so special. Miko, choko, and the pool enteratinment staff were some favorites...and Claudia in the sports bar was a sweetheart! we didnt see a lot of people tipping though so please be sure you do because they really derserve it!!! 2) restaurants- good vairety to choose from and the buffetts were large so there was always something for everyone. the only thing is to be sure you make reservations for the restaurants early because they fill up super fast and can only accomodate small crowds. I wasn't able to go to them all but my favorites were the Japanese and the fusion Krystal restuarant. 3) entertainment was good. pool always had something going on. At night there were one hour shows after a band playing the courtyard. I was there with my parents who werent up for late nights so it worked out well and the show would be done at 11. then for those who wanted to go out, they could go into town to the discos for $7 a cab ride. playa nightlife is great too for those who want to party (go to 12th street...all of the late night action is there. its super safe and people walking the streets everywhere.... i love it!) 4) cleanliness- this hotel was immaculate! they were always mopping, cleaning, and keeping the place spotless! our maid was awesome and so polite and kind. any time you called for a maintenance issue they would be over in 5 minutes (i always have to wait about half hour in other hotels in mexico). 5) rooms- good size but note that if you have 3 people, the rooms all have king beds (or two doubles but they put them together to make a king), Request a cot though and they wll bring it. We had 3 adultsin one room and were totally comfortable with the size. Our jacuzzi tub was broke but that was our fault for not calling to get it fixed...we were too busy at the pool to care. you have access to the other resorts but we were so happy there that we barely left! we went down to the other pools one day and that was about it. also, you are about a 15 minute beach walk to town where all the shopping/discos/restaurants are. the location was perfect and i wish i could have stayed longer than a week.

We were there from Nov 5 to Nov 12, it was our 5th time in the area, in previous years we have stayed at the Riu Playacar, and Sandos. We really like the area. For those who are not familiar with the area, there are 10 hotels in a semi gated community area, about 10 to 15 mins from Playa Del Carmen, a small shopping, beach, hotel district. The other hotels in the area include, The Reef, 2 Wyndhams, Occidental Allegro, The Royal Hideaway, and 4 Rius, Playacar, another Palace, Yucatan, and Tequila. There is also a Riu Lipita, it is closer to the entrance and does not have beach access neither does the Tequila. But both have a small beach location that can be visited. Having the gold band gives you access to all RIUs in the area. There is also a small shopping complex with a Starbucks across from the RIU Playacar. Weather We have never been in Nov, in previous years we have visited in April and June. The weather was nice, rained a bit a couple of the days, 1 day for about 30 mins. It was cloudier then during the other months, but very nice. The sun does start going down a lot eariler, about 3 with it setting around 5:30. Pool There are 3 pools, a tiny one for kids, an infinity pool that overlooks the larger pool with the pool bar. The pool bar area had small areas with tables. It can be at times quite a partying area. The RPRM seems to be the Palace with more action then the other Palace. There are a lot of loungers around the pool and a lot of shaded areas with umbrellas and trees. Even though the sign says loungers cannot be saved, they ARE. I went out every day around 8 and pretty much EVERY lounger directly around the pool was saved with a towel (what time do these people get up at?). The most annoying part is most people don\u2019t come to sit in them until the afternoon. In our 7 days there, we didn\u2019t have one of these loungers, I guess I don\u2019t get up early enough. The bartenders are great and fun. Marvin at the pool bar was such a fun guy. Oh they also have waiter service at your lounger or at the beach, they come around a lot. Gym My full intention was to go to the gym every day, I only managed 1 day, only because the gym is so disappointing. It was very small and very busy, and not a lot of equipment, 2 treadmills. The machines were so close together also. One the day I was there, there were 2 people doing yoga, both were also very tall, so they took up more space in an already small gym. I went on the treadmill, and then looked around to find no room to do anything else so I left. That was disappointing. There have been comments about machines not working, I can\u2019t comment about that since I was unable to use anything. Food We only ate at the buffets. They were decent, lunch and dinner had similar food. Dinner always had a nite, international, mexican. No complaints about the food, I like to eat the same thing all the time. My only complaint is the size of the area, there was not a lot of room to move around. I think that buffets also make people have tunnel vision, they would bud in use food from the pasta bar when they should use the salad area. The staff is excellent, always friendly and accommodating. Please remember to tip them, it really goes along way and they are very appreciative. Room The style is defiantly not what I prefer personally. It was a lot of dark wood and marble with pictures of ancient urns. But it was very clean with a big patio area. It had a little sitting area with a love seat and flat screen TV, the channels had a number of English stations. I have seen complaints on here about the mainfloor rooms and bugs, but I didn\u2019t see one bug my whole trip.We had the main floor close to the lobby. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any rooms with a beach view if that is important to you. The whole area is not very large, so it is not a long trek from the lobby to the beach. Beach The beach is really nice and long you can walk all the way to Playdel Carmen on the beach. There is a hammock area which I really enjoyed. There area a lot of loungers in the trees and closer to the water. We walked up the beach to the last hotel (Sandos) every day, it is a good walk, you can stop at the other RIUs a long the way for a drink or a washroom or pool break. We have been 5 years in a row and I have noticed this year the beach was a bit dirtier, and I directly equate this to the patrons at the hotels. Smokers feel the need to leave their butts in the sand or in one case throw them directly in the ocean, it was disgusting! There was a lot of plastic on the beach also this time. Also one day we had a beach party and I noticed people left their Styrofoam plates and cups on the beach which in the wind will fly away. Now it was defiantly not a trash pile or anything I just noticed more this year then previous years. The Ocean \u2013 if you have never been there before the colour can\u2019t be described, it was warm and very wavy on one day, and it was a lot of fun to play in the waves. Directly in front of the RPRM there is a sandbar that goes out pretty far, so the water in the area is not deep but it does create some really good waves. Entertainment, lobby bar, sports bar Every note they seemed to have some sort of dinner entertainment before the actual show at 9:45. The entertainment staffs was super fun. There were a lot of activities but they don\u2019t bug you to join in. We only watched the \u2018circus show\u2019 but heard the vegas show was good. We ventured to the other Palace for the Greese show, which I have seen every years we have stayed at a RIU, it was very fun as in previous years, but did not come to our hotel in the time that we were there. The lobby has wifi and the lobby bar is large and the bartender is very professional and friendly. The sportsbar has games and TVs and snacks like sandwiches/fruit and is open 24 hours. The bartender there, Victor is great! I have read complaints about it being dark, it is fine, what do you expect from a sports bar in Mexico?

Check-in was quick and efficient and the front desk staff was very friendly and could speak good English with a great Mexican accent. We arrived about 4:30, 2 hours late because of a plane delay and our room was ready. The 2 hours sitting on a plane waiting for repairs was the only bad part of the whole trip. Our room was exceptionally clean and exactly what I had asked for ahead of time. It was on the second floor, with a king bed and close to the pool and beach area. The beds are firm but we are used to that and there were two pillows each, one firmer than the other, a pleasent surprise.We had also e- mailed ahead of time and made dinner reservations at the specialty restaurants for the first 2 nights. The seating\u2019s are at 6:30 or 8:45. If you eat the wonderful breakfast buffet and lunch buffet and drink by the pool all afternoon, I would suggest the later dinner hour. You will get out just about the time the evening show starts. The shows are actually quite good. There is often music before the show outside and that was your only opportunity to dance for about 45 min. Several nights we chose to eat at the buffet for dinner so as to be able to take advantage of this. There is no disco at the hotel but you could walk about 10 minutes or so to another Rui that does have one I understand. Our favorite restaurants were the Bolofogo (woderful assortmant of grilled meats brought to your table), and the Japanese. Krystal was also very nice but the lamb that we both had very tough. The food at the buffet is also quite excellent with many choices. The salad bar, fruit bar and dessert bar were exceptional and always a choice of beef, chicken, seafood and pasta of some variety. One night there was a whole beef tenderloin and another whole salt encruted fish. It really is a matter of if you would prefer a sit down waited on dinner ornot as the buffet is also good. Overall the food is not gourmet but vey good considering the number of people they are serving. We took the opportunty to do the kitchen tour and it is quite a place.I have run a restaurant many years ago and my son is a chef in Boston so it was interesting to see. Be sure to order the Chilian Chenin Blanc or Shiraz, it is not top shelf like the licquer but better than the house Mexican wines. The bar does serve top shelf licquer but you have to ask for it. This is not the highest shelf but Castillo rum, Bacardi, Jonny Walker Red, Absolute Vodka, Jim Beam, Kailua,and you have an idea. You really do not need to bring your own big insulated mug unless you camp out way down on the beach as there is pool service and even wait staff on the upper tier of the beach under the palm trees to take your order. Also the pool bar is close to the beach. Your room is stocked with water, beer and soda and a mini bar with brandy rum and vodka. I did think the brandy was watered down but nothing at any of the bars themselves. The pool and the beach are amazing. There is lots of seating and you only will need to get up early if you wish a lounge chair and umbrella drectly next to the pool. The beach is as clean as the hotel with nice sand and it is wide and long. There are plenty of lounges in the sun on the beach as well us up one level on the sand under the palm trees.You can walk a half mile into the town or also in the other direction past all the other all exclusive hotels. We looked at them all and are happy with The Rui Playa Riviera as our choice. The Rui Mexico is nice also but a little worn around the pool as it is older, and a long way from the pool to the beach. The water sports staff was great and we did the snorkel trip that went to a wonderful reef. The only draw back being there were several beginners and you had to stay together which limited the time to explore. The resort had 4 wonderfully minted Hobie cats and Were happy to let you out twice a day if they were not being used. The weather and winds were perfect and I took advantage of it. The Whole staff gets my compliment for friendliness. They go out of their way to see that you have everything you need. The entertainment staff does a nice job and will encourage you to take past in activities like aerobics, Spanish lessons, dance lessons, but they are not at all pushy. They are also usually a part of the shows at night so you see them all the time. They are very fun and well picked for their jobs. The Lobby bar and the bar at the show operate differently from the pool bar. Orders are taken by supervisors and then handed to waiters that get your drinks and bring them to the tables. These guys get exceptional from me for service. Especially a few, Isaias, Chano and Pedro you guys are great. If you wish for good service you should try talking with the staff as they appreciate not just being taken for granted.

The rooms were always clean, we had more towels than we ever needed (and cute towel animals every day), and they come a second time for turndown service. Our room had a true king bed (not two twins pushed together). There were plenty of chairs at the pool and on the beach all day. I was told we were at 93% capacity and never had to trouble with chairs or towels. The spa has a tiny sauna and a hot tub (that was warm, not hot). We did not try any of the fee based services or the gym. In the lobby they have various representatives from travel companies- unless you are uncomfortable using public transportation or renting a car- I would stay away from these. They are overpriced and after our first tour we realized I could plan more for half the price. We rented a car from the Thrifty representative for $60 USD/d insured but without liability and parked right out front for the rest of the trip. You can probably get a car cheaper if you are willing to go into town and rent from there. The location is great- 20 min walk to town. We drove to Cancun, Chichen Itza, and Tulum with minimal difficulty. The front desk has a free tourist map. It's actually on the Playacar property and near several other Rius that you can go to with your wristband. The food was just ok in my opinion. The buffet had a good selection and I was never hungry- but it was just ok. As far as drinks, they were small so you got stuck going back more often. We tried all of the restaurants except for the Steakhouse-which was closed for weddings frequently (try to book reservations here sooner). Krystal (the fusion themed restaurant) was by far the best and we liked it so much we went back a second time. I would recommend this hotel to others and was very pleased with it for what we paid, even considering the food. After staying here, I am surprised at some of the negative reviews I saw here.

The rooms were first class, the service second to none, and the food at the restaurants was exceptional. We visited them all, but must admit the Krystal Fusion was by far the best and truely outstanding. A similar meal for two back home in Blighty with the wines and aperitifs would set you back at least \u00a3150. The resort itself is only a fifteen minute stroll to the centre of Playa Del Carmen and 5th Avenue where their are plenty of bars restaurants and shops. Haggle in the shops and you will pay half the price. The entertainment at night was not the greatest, but they really did try to make it a pleasurable experience, and we made sure we joined in the fun. The Lobby Bar was great for a drink before your meal, and after the first night, our drink was poured before and at our seats before we reached them. We were caught in the storm on the Thursday of our stay. The staff were amazing. We were sent to our room at 1230 and the staff delivered a packed lunch. We were allowed out at 6.30pm. The following morning the work and effort by staff to clear the debris enabled us to use the facilities at the swimming pool by 8am. It is impossible to single out any member of staff - They were all as good as each other. A great stay and well worth a return visit. We have fond memories of the Palace, The Staff, and the wonderful friendships we made with people from all over the world.

This is our 5th trip to the Riviera Maya area, we have stayed at two other Riu properties, Barcel\u00f3 Tropical and the Bahia Principe Tulum resorts. We have also stayed on the Riu Santa Fe in Los Cabos therefore feel we can give a fair review. Front Desk: The front desk staff was amazing, pleasant and very helpful. We unfortunately lost our luggage and they took care of contacting the airlines and making the arrangements while we started our vacation. We had e-mailed the resort one week prior with dinner reservation and requested a room in a certain block since I did my research prior to our trip. They gave us our requested reservation but were not able to give us the room I requested..No big deal..that was just a nice to have...but did get a courtyard view room which I did not pay for the upgrade so I was very pleased. Room: The room size was adequate, the beds were comfortable enough for us and there was plenty of storage space for two adults. We had requested a room closer to the beach but instead received a room right over the main buffet area (room #3094) which was great. The view of the main court yard was nice and the resort is laid out nicely and is not a very big complex so any room facing the courtyard would have been adequate. The room was very clean, the maids did a great job keeping the room tidy during our stay. Food: The buffet was great and always had many choices as others have commented on. There is always a lot of fresh fish and seafood options for lunch and dinner. I took a picture of the buffet and entertainment schedule which I will post since I find that information valuable for planning your week. We went to Krystal and Brazilian restaurants. Both were ok, nothing over the top that is for sure. The 24 hour sports bar has the best cappuccino ever..different machine then the buffet. Beach and Location: This one of my favourite beaches, the nicest I have seen in the Playa del Carmen area. Lots of shade and loungers. The bar service at the beach was a little slow so would spend the afternoons in the pool area. The location is great too, nice walk to other Riu\u2019s and nice walk into town. Service: All of the staff are friendly and over accommodating. The staff at the bar were over the top but we tip generously so are usually taken care of.

This was our first trip to Mexico and first time at a Riu resort, so we didn\u2019t quite know what to expect\u2026 Other than a few little glitches, it was a great time! ROOM: We booked a regular junior suite and we found out that those are the suites that face out towards the other resorts (the hotel is in a big U shape). I was hoping for a view facing inwards towards the pool and all the pretty fountains and gardens, so I was a little disappointed. We went to our room to find that while the view wasn\u2019t completely terrible (the grounds were pretty and we could still see a little bit of the ocean to the left on the balcony), our room faced directly at the roof of the resort next door, which was under construction! All we could hear was drilling and banging. We went back down to the front desk and asked if we could be moved, but all the upgraded rooms were booked for the next two days. They were very kind though, and moved us down the hall away from the construction and offered to get us into a room facing inwards in two days when one was to become available (those are the \u201cSuperior\u201d rooms, and they cost a little more). So we spent two days in the room that faced out, and I must say it was a little depressing. You don\u2019t really feel like you are staying at a nice resort with that kind of view. We spent as little time in there as possible! The front desk staff kept track of us and moved us a couple of days later to a \u201cSuperior\u201d suite facing inwards towards the courtyard (room 2104). NOW we felt like we were staying at the Riu Palace! The view from our balcony on the 2nd floor was beautiful and we had a clear view of the grounds, beach, pools and courtyard! I actually wanted to spend time on the deck and enjoy the view! So my advice for choosing a room is to spend the extra few dollars and get the \u201cSuperior\u201d suite (or the Jacuzzi suite if you can, haha!). It is worth every penny and will change your experience at this resort! Both rooms had sort of a dull musty smell (something we were warned of in prior reviews of this resort). That said, it was not a big issue for us and I can assure you that the hotel staff does an excellent job of keeping everything clean! The regular junior suite had two double beds pushed together, and the \u201cSuperior\u201d suite had an actual large bed! Not sure what that\u2019s all about\u2026 Both were pretty comfortable. We also liked the double sinks in the bathroom! Please see the pictures I posted of both the regular junior suite and the \u201cSuperior\u201d suite \u2013 they are identical rooms, except for the view/location within the hotel. BEACH/POOL: The pool area was lively and the entertainment staff kept things fun! They played good music at a decent volume, the swim up bar was cool, and there were lots of fun pool activities! Pool volleyball, bingo (yes, bingo in the pool!), water exercises, dance lessons and scuba diving lessons were only a few of the things we saw going on! We spent most of our time at the beach area, mostly because it was more low-key and less crazy than the pool (which is more our speed). The beach staff came by periodically and brought us drinks from the pool bar so we never had to get up! The ocean water was warm and very clean - almost totally free of yucky stuff (seaweed, coral, etc). Lots of palm trees as well as lots of open beach space allowed for all the sun or shade you wanted at any time. The hammocks under the palm trees were awesome too! There were lots of beach chairs available, but if you want to get your pick of location, you should get there a little early and claim your spot! FOOD: The breakfast buffet was one of the best I\u2019ve ever experienced! Any and every kind of breakfast food was served, and it all tasted AWESOME! I miss it already\u2026 The lunch buffet is pretty standard and very good, although we only ate there once as we were usually off doing different water activities or excursions during the lunch hours. We typically caught the buffet during the snack time, which was pretty basic \u2013 pizza, pasta, salad and lots of chips, cheese and chili dip! Nothing special, but it kept us fed. You have the choice to eat at the main buffet for dinner, Don Manolo, every night. But if you want to eat at a specialty restaurant, you have to make a reservation in advance, which can only be done between 12:00 \u2013 3:00pm in the main lobby. Not a huge deal, but a couple of the places we wanted to try were taken a couple of the days, so get there at noon and reserve the restaurant you want! The main buffet, Don Manolo, had a really great selection with a theme that changed nightly. You will not have a problem finding something you like, no matter what your tastes! We loved Agave, the Mexican restaurant, as the food was truly authentic and so tasty! Krystal, the fanciest restaurant, was clearly very good, but really not my kind of food (I don\u2019t usually like the super-fancy types of food they serve there, but you might!) Krystal is also the smallest size restaurant and therefore the hardest to get into, so book this one a couple of days out if you want to try it! Botafogo, the Brazilian restaurant, was a disappointment for us. My boyfriend is Brazilian and we know a lot about the food, and the food they served had NOTHING whatsoever to do with Brazilian cuisine. The sports bar was open all the time, but don\u2019t expect anything fancy in terms of food\u2026 hamburgers, sandwiches and fruit will keep you fed, but nothing spectacular. The service everywhere was fantastic!! Every server in every location made it their mission to make you happy and they were all so friendly! We tipped them regularly as we went along because they worked so hard! EVENING ENTERTAINMENT: The pools close at 8:00pm and the beach area goes dark, so don\u2019t plan any late-night beach walks or swimming. There was a very good band playing in the courtyard every night during dinner hours, but at around 9:00pm when everyone was gathering outside listening to them and people were just starting to dance, they would stop the music completely and start a children\u2019s show on the entertainment stage nearby. It made no sense to us because there would only be literally 5 kids maximum dancing around to the childrens\u2019 show while about 200 adults stood there staring at each other in the courtyard. There were shows scheduled nightly for adults that started around 10:15pm, but we always got so bored waiting for the childrens\u2019 show to end that we would just go back to our room and sit on the balcony, so we didn\u2019t bother with the later entertainment. All in all, this place was just what we needed \u2013 beautiful, relaxing, excellent customer service in every area of the resort, good food, good room (after we were able to upgrade!), and just a fantastic experience overall! I highly recommend it and my boyfriend and I will definitely be back!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buckinghamshire", "Title": "\u201cAbsoluty Amazing Hotel and Wedding!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Travel_Agent1610", "ReviewID": "UR119822913", "Content": "We travellered out here in may 2011 for 14 nights for our wedding.

We were scheduled to stay at the RIU Playacar but upgraded at the last minute. No comparison. This hotel is like and night and day compared to the RIU Playacar. I also thought it stacked up to the Royal which we stayed at in April. Building/Grounds 5.0 Very impressive with high-grade stone/marble, fancy chandeliers, very well-groomed grounds. In April I walked from the Royal on the beach and ended up checking out the RIU Palace. Based on the photos I returned with, my bonita senorita (of almost 30 years) and I knew we had to stay here. Check-in/Check-out 5.0 Much much better and easier then the Royal. The time of year had something to do with it but, still the check-in staff is very pleasant and all seemed happy in their work. Food 4.0 I didn't think the restaurants were as good overall as the Royal. The food however was very good for buffet style and the main restaurant was quiet nice. The service in the restaurants and bars in general was outstanding. Room 4.0 It did have the musty smell that others complained about, but with the air condition on and a quick candle burning, not a big deal. The room itself was basic with a nice garden view and balcony. What really stood out was the exceptional cleaning by the staff. I'm a slob and often track sand in the room, yet unlike the Royal, the floor was spotless after every cleaning. Beach 5.0 Much better spot than the Royal. Nice stretch of beach with no shortage of palm trees (something the Royal lacked). A quick 10 minute walk to the left facing the beach took you to 5th avenue. A quick 10 minute walk to the right took you to along a great stretch of beach and other nice resorts. Pool 5.0 I really liked the pool area which included a nice infinity pool which we seem to have to ourselves. The pool bar had a old beer smell so we had the staff bring us drinks (in a big thermos). No issue with getting a pool chair. The Royal requied a 5am wake-up to get a good spot. Entertainment 3.0 Typical of these type of resorts. However, the Michael Jackson show was really good. Grease? Yikes Sandi had quite a tan. Service 5.0 Best ever at a resort. Didn't hurt that the resort seemed half-full. Compared to other RIU resorts in Playacar 5.0 No comparision. Absolutely the best and most impressive of the RIUs. If you visit them all you'll see what i mean. The Palace Mexico reminds me of Disneyland.. older not quite as nice as Disneyworld...in my opinion. Safety 5.0 All resorts in this area are part of a gated half-hotel, half-residential area which is very nice. We found a park along the street which had interesting Mayan ruins which we enjoyed (not Tulum but enough to say you saw Mayan ruins :) Transportation back to airport 5.0 Wow what a differance. So much easier than the Royal which was an absolute mad-house similar to the airport. They didn't even bother taking our bracelets (which are now available on Ebay.. kidding) Romance Factor 5.0 Sitting outside in the main restaurant on a beautiful evening with music playing in the courtyard with the most beautiful woman in the world was very memorable. The only complaint here is limited opportunities for dancing. They should add more of that as its cheap entertainment. Sports Bar 2.0 Crappy food, could be improved. Gym 2.0 I like using the treadmill in all-inclusives to keep the poundage off. Their equipment was poorly maintained and limited. Clean though which was such a common theme everywhere. Overall very very satisfied and highly recommend this hotel resort.

We decided to go for a 5 star hotel [all inclusive] just see how much better than our traditional 4 star in tenerife. We could have had 2 holidays in tenerife for what we paid for 10 days in mexico. Firstly I know no one can guarantee the weather but 5 days of rain [4 of it torential] didn't help].We booked with Thomsons and were told we could only purchase things with Mexican pesos. What rubbish! in Playa del carmen most prices were shown in American dollars. I was going to take dollars but was told i could not use them. The Mexicans wil also take Euros [of which i had about 250 at home. Come on Thomsons get your facts up to date! Not only that but all the excursions are priced in dollars! Be aware also of the exit tax of 750 pesos[about \u00a340] which of course they will take in any currency.We flew from manchester and because of a head wind the flight took 10.5 hours instead of 9.50. We then spent almost 2 hours in the airport going thru customs and being registered for our exit tax. We took the maximum allownce of cigarettes & cigars our of Manchester and were then quizzed in Mexico about the amount. Fortunately they let us keep our entitlement but this is just what you need after such a long flight! The Riviera maya is a lovely hotel but because of the rain we spent a great deal of time inside. The cocktails and food were in general very good! I am however stggered at the waste of water in the hotel. one is advised to re-use bath towels to save water yet there is no guttering on the hotel so all the rainwater simply runs away, eventually. Also water was actually getting into the hotel and driping down the walls and thru the ceiling! In fairness the hotel did provide umbrellas to cope with the rain. Other people have commented on the provision of drinks & coffee in the rooms. on 3 days out of 10 we were left without any coffee for the folowing morning and several time our optics & soft drinks ran out and were not replaced. Not 5 star service by any means!. The excursions were expensive so we ventured to Cancun on our own one day. A taxi to the bus ststion was 70 pesos[about \u00a33.50] but the bargain was the bus to Cancun [about \u00a38.50,168 pesos return for both of us. The buses are very comfortable with a toilet, reclining seats and a movie for the 1hr 15 min journey. Once in Cancun you then catch the R1 or R2 bus to the hotel , shop or nightlife areas[10 pesos each]. We did find the the fact that we were staying in a Riu 5 star very useful as we were able to luch at another 5 star hotel where the food was superb! The enterntainment in the hotel was average. Having visited a few Thomson gold hotels in Europe where professional acts are flown out from Britain the local enterntainment varied from very good [the Micheal Jackson show on our last night] to poor. There was also no written info on the next few nights shows just an annoucement at the end of each show. Also with 5 other RIU hotels in the area where one could go, there was no info on what shows were on in other hotels. 5th Avenue in Playa Car is your traditional tourist strip and you do get hassled all the time by the shop owners. The food as you would expect was good but strangely there were no baked beans at breakfast. The junior suite we had was comfortable and spacious but looked out to the back of the hotel onto a pathway and the hotel next door.

From the leaking ceilings not to mention the FALLING ceilings we were already not impressed. They do not upgrade anything, just patch oil the ceilings with a garbage bag. It's the whole hotel! There are carpets and buckets everywhere! This is a RUI hotel!!! Are you frigging kidding me! The rooms looked NOTHING like the pictures that were shown on the sites and not to mention the dirty sheets that were on the beds! We wish we didnt choose to go mexico after this experience. The night life on the resort was lame and not to mention short lived! I thought Mexicans like to party... Uh ya, not on this resort! And something I have never seen before... They shut all the lights off in the main lobby by 11:00 pm... I'm not sure wha they are saving money for because they sure aren't using it to fix the leaks! I have never felt so sick to m stomach leaving a resort for a week but after being here i just returned this morning and I'm still burping up the food! We preferred to eat OFF the resort! Thankful the beach was amazing but yet again the resort entertainment during the day was boring. We were more interested in the next resorts entertainment then ours. Off the resort we enjoyed ourselves so much but we have never been so bored and in bed so early from being on a resort. Once again, overrated and overpriced! I'm all about spending but this was definitely not worth it. There was only one worker at the resort that was most helpful and his name was Nemo t front desk. The service otherwise from the other staff wasn't even worth tipping and we always tip well. This is the first time we ever came home with mos of the money we brought on our trip.

This was our 4th stay in this area of Mexico...our 2nd this year, but our first at this resort. In April of this year we stayed at The Royal Playa del Carmen (see my review here on TA), which is rated #6 of all of the resorts in the Riviera Maya here on TA. The RPRM is rated #31....I strongly disagree with this rating. The RPRM should be rated much higher and since I've stayed at the #6 and now here, I can offer a very honest comparison. The only Con that I can think of about this resort is that it is NOT an adult only resort. The Royal is and that was a huge plus for us since our kids are grown and don't travel with us any longer. Having said that, the RPRM really doesn't have that much to offer children and I would seriously advise parents to look for resorts that cater to families with children otherwise the kiddos won't have much to keep them occupied at this resort. Now on to the Pro's and there are many. Check-in..... was a breeze compared to The Royal. The front desk staff was welcoming and friendly (don't believe the negative reviews about the front desk staff, remember people will treat you with respect and kindness if you treat them with that same respect and kindness). Our room was ready, we were offered a cold drink and a wonderful gentlemen took our luggage, escorted us to our suite and showed us the mini bar, bathroom, lights, air conditioner, safe etc. (#1130) Great, quiet location located in the center between the lobby and the pool/beach with not much walking to either. Our jr suite..... was SPOTLESS...the floors were kept extremely clean during our entire stay as was the entire suite. We had 1 king sized bed (NOT 2 beds pushed together like we had at The Royal). The bed was firm but comfortable and the linens were fresh and clean. 2 steps down to the living room area with a nice flatscreen tv and a slider out to the balcony with 2 reclining chairs and a table. We had a nice garden view and overlooked the resort next door. It was so peaceful and quiet and we had our coffee out there every morning. The bathroom has double sinks and a combination bathtub w/jets and shower. There is also plenty of storage in the room...a large closet with about a dozen hangers, a safe and a nice sized bureau with 6 drawers as well as 2 nightstands with drawers. The liquor dispenser hangs on the wall above a counter which holds an ice bucket and a small coffee maker, under that is the small refrigerator with plenty of bottled water, soda and beer which is replenished daily. They also provide coffee, sweetener and powdered cream, however I brought my own Dunkin Donuts coffee and filters since I find the Mexican coffee extremely strong. There is an iron and ironing board, clock radio/alarm, blow dryer, magnifying mirror and essentials like soap, shampoo, lotion, comb, sewing kit, shower cap etc. all provided in the suite. The housekeeper leaves a towel animal each day and there is turndown service each evening complete with a couple of Hershey's kisses. The buildings/grounds.... While there we visited the RIU Playacar, RIU Tequila and the RIU Palace Mexico....none of these resorts compared to this resort. We were originally booked at the Playacar but I had the chance to upgrade (for a mere $95 more for the week) at the last minute and I'm so relieved that I did. The Playacar looks old and tired and in need of a facelift. The other Palace is nice but the lobby is not as opulent and the pool is small in comparison. This resort is absolutely gorgeous...the lobby is like walking into one of the mansions in Newport, RI it's that impressive. Beautiful chandeliers, gorgeous marble, granite and limestone everywhere, a breathtakingly beautiful stained glass ceiling and a gorgeous lapis blue domed ceiling that took my breath away each time I looked up into it. The wrought iron railings and gorgeous woodwork and furniture complete this impressive establishment. It's clear that this resort was well thought out and no attention to detail was spared. Right outside the lobby is the main piazza with plenty of seating and a huge fountain in the middle. There is a covered raised structure that serves as a stage for the nightly musicians. To one side of this piazza you'll find the main buffet restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating and to the other side you'll find the theater where the entertainment staff performs each evening at 9:45. The Mexican, Fusion, Brazilian and Japanese restaurants are also all in this area. Beyond the piazza are the beautiful fountains and large towering palm trees which line the walkway down to the pool/beach area. Everything is tiled with beautiful Mexican tiles which are scrubbed clean each morning. The gardens and lawns are meticulously trimmed and groomed...they really are quite lovely. Nothing is overlooked. Dining..... We made reservations at the Mexican, Steakhouse (Chili's) and Japanese, but we didn't end up going to the Japanese because the buffet was so delicious. The Mexican and Steakhouse were both very good. The Mexican starts off with a large hot/cold appetizer buffet and the rest of the meal is table served. Ask for the Mayan coffee and they'll put on a little show with fire at the table. This is also done at the Steakhouse with the baked Alaska dessert. I had the land/sea combo at the Steakhouse and my husband had the ribeye. Both of us enjoyed our selections, the steak was tender and cooked to the desired temperature. The chilled seafood appetizer that they served was awesome as well. No complaints about either of these restaurants. The buffet was the best of any all-inclusive resort that we've ever stayed at. I don't understand the few reviews that complain about the food. Every single item is prepared with the greatest of care and the hot food is kept very hot and the cold food is kept ice cold. The selection is incredible...many choices of meat, seafood, vegetables, rice, potatoes, fruit, cheese, soups, salads and desserts. If you can't find something to your liking then I must ask...what do you eat? I'm a food snob, I'll admit it. I like to dine. I can't say enough about the food at this resort. The Merlot is also very good. lol Pool/beach areas..... So beautiful. Plenty of loungers which is awesome...at The Royal we had to wake up before 6am to save our chairs for the day, that was unnecessary at this resort. Now, I realize it's slow season, but there were literally hundreds of loungers between the pool and beach. There are also many many many palm trees to protect you from the hot sun. The pool is nice and clean...people who complained of many tiles missing and the pool being dirty must have exagerated because I witnessed exactly 2 small 1\" tiles missing in the infinity pool and it was always very clean. The beach is MUCH better than the beach at The Royal (which abuts the Cozumel ferry). This resort's beach has nice soft white sand and crystal clear turquoise blue water. The staff..... are all lovely. Every single one of them from the bartenders to the waitstaff to the housekeepers to the grounds keepers are there to make sure you have the best vacation possible. They want to please you, they treat you like royalty. Each time I came back to my seat from the buffet someone would rush over to pull my chair out, it was so touching. They're respectful, friendly, hardworking people...please treat them accordingly. I realize this review is lengthy but I wanted to give my honest opinion. There are a few negative reviews on here from the same time period that I was at this resort and I'm here to tell you I didn't witness or experience any of the things that these reviewers claimed. I did witness a few travellers being rude to the staff and maybe that explains it. Do not hesitate to book this resort. I can say without an ounce of doubt that we will stay here again...I've NEVER felt that way about any of the many resorts we've stayed at in the past. RIU is doing something right. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Book the RIU Palace Riviera Maya with confidence that you'll have as wonderful a holiday as we did.

That said, we were originally supposed to have stayed 8 nights at RIU Palace Mexico. Because it was so terrible, after 3 hrs, we checked out and into this place. This is a much better and much more contemporary experience. Here are the details: THE HOTEL: The hotel is located in a secure/gated area, Playa Car. A short, $7 cab ride, or about 20 min walk to Playa del Carmen. There are 5 RIUs in this area, as well as some other resorts and homes. You're actually allowed to use the facilities at any of the other RIUs, with the exception of dinner. You must eat dinner at this hotel. It's a nice feature if you decide to venture out along the beach and want to stop for a drink at one of the other properties. This is a grand hotel, as most of them are along this strip. Very well kept, both inside and out. The grounds themselves are immaculately maintained, and really beautiful. The hotel sits perpendicular to the beach, so there aren't any beach front rooms. A bit strange, considering other hotels on this stretch of beach do offer this, but the walk to the beach isn't far, and the pool is the best of all the RIUs. The gym is small, especially for a \"5 star\" resort, and the equipment definitely needs to be updated. The beach is really beautiful though, and weather permitting, you have free use of Boogie Boards, kayaks, catamarans, and snorkel equipment. Very nice. There are plenty of lounge chairs on the beach, as well as palm trees and hammocks. Wait service is available, and the bar is a pretty short walk as well. THE ROOMS: First off, the beds were like sleeping on a rock. You can ask for a mattress pad, which helps a little, but be warned...it only makes the rock you're sleeping on seem like a mossy rock. While much nicer than RIU Palace Mexico, the rooms could definitely use some updating, as well as some personality. They were clean, and didn't smell, but they were also generic and non-descript. Close the window, and you could be in, \"insert generic hotel chain here\". Remember: this is a FIVE STAR hotel, so rooms with some personality are expected. The rooms are cleaned 2x a day though, which is nice, and the mini bar (beer, soda, water) is free and replaced daily, although sometimes they did need a reminder. We had the Jr Suite Superior, which faced the main fountain area. It had a large balcony which was great. The drawback was the noise. The entertainment at night took place in the area outside the balcony, so it made sleeping a little tough. Our room was 2094, so if you get a room that's closer to the pool, the noise will be much less. We did see the King Suite, which was pretty amazing! But much more expensive, and there are very few of them. THE FOOD: The food was just \"ok\". Do not expect to come away from this with any type of appreciation of what real Mexican cuisine is. If you're a foodie, in any way, shape or form, you probably won't come home and rave to your friends about the food and how great it was. There is one main restaurant, Don Manolo. It's a buffet, and you can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner here. Breakfast is a massive buffet with anything you could want. No complaints at all. Lunch: Underwhelming and after the first day, you really don't want to go back. Lots of fried food and heavy Mexican dishes that are sitting out for long periods of time. Dinner: Also a buffet, lots of choices, most of which are very average. I will say that Friday night they had a pallea that was actually very good. There are also 5 A la Carte restaurants in the hotel. The bad thing is that you have to make reservations in person, the day of, at noon every day. A bit of a hassle. We were lucky enough to have met a wonderful staff member, Rene, who was working in Don Manolo's. He made our weeks reservations for us, before noon, and without us having to wait on line ever! Try to find him, and see if he'll do the same for you. Just please, make sure you take good care of him! :) These restaurants are Japanese, Brazilian, Steak House, Fusion, Mexican. Why they didn't choose to make these 5 unique Mexican restaurants, allowing us to taste the many flavors of different parts of this great country, I don't know...Also, the menu in these places never changes. There will always be the same 4-5 choices on the menu, so it gets a bit tired. Japanese: Very nice place, probably one of the best. The fish wasn't that fresh though. Brazilian: If you like meat, this place is actually pretty good. Also kinda fun because it's the \"ridizio\" style of eating. Fusion: This is the \"high-end\" place. It's French fusion food, and it's pretty good. I had the lamb, which was over-cooked, but I tried all the dishes. Mexican: lots of food, because you start with a buffet, which could easily be the meal itself. The food is \"ok\", again, not the pinnicle of Mexican cuisine, and pretty heavy. The shrimp ajilo was the best on the menu. THE SERVICE: I have to say, I was very impressed with the service. With the exception of having to ask several times for things like a mattress pad and water to be brought to the room, the service in the bars and restaurants was really fantastic. FOR KIDS: The sole reason we came here was because of our son\u2014we wanted to make sure there were activities for him. It's really hit or miss because it depends on how many kids are there, but they do have RIU Land, which has \"counselors\" who do activities a couple times a day with the kids. Jocelyn, who is in charge of this, is absolutely amazing!!!! At night they also have \"mini disco\", where they have a show with the kids. It's only about 30 mins, but it's great for the kids, they can run around everywhere and nobody cares. PLAYA DEL CARMEN: A $7 cab ride, this is the \"main town\". It's a tourist town on the beach, nothing more. The main street, \"Avenida 5\", is filled with aggressive and annoying vendors, constantly calling to you to buy their tacky souvenirs. If you come here thinking its the \"real Mexico\", you'll be wrong and disappointed. It's filled with plenty of over-priced bars and restaurants. We did come for lunch 2x, but seeked out places off this strip that were actually really good. Aguachiles + El Fagon. XCARET: Absolutely amazing. You have to see this place to believe it. Go early and spend the entire day. Take a cab, $15 each way, and buy the Xcaret Plus ticket.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cFabulous holidahy/hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Evelyn W", "ReviewID": "UR119601226", "Content": "We were at the Riu 11-18th October 2011 celebrating my 50th birthday.

I must say that the pool at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya is the best pool out of all of the Riu's in this area, however, it's location is out of the loop a bit compared to the other Riu's. It's a short/maybe 8 to 10 minute walk to get to the other Riu's, however, if it's hot, you will not want to make that walk. It's also the closest to downtown Playacar........so, give and take. This Riu is the newest of the Palaces in the area and has a 24 hour sports bar and an Italian Restaurant both of which the other Riu Palace Mexico does not have. You can stay here and use the amenities of the other or vice versa. I felt that the entertainment was very good at night/meaning the shows. The decor is very ornate and the grounds were amazingly manicured. This is a very easy property to get around and everything is in very close proximity to the lobby area. The jacuzzi suite is well worth the upgrade and at the very least/the suite......but if it's not in your budget/ at least upgrade to the courtyard view......this view enables you to see the main walkway and the fountains from your room...........this part is a must and only a few dollars more. There are a total of 6 Riu's in this area that you will be able to use by staying at the Palace and for a 7 night stay......this is huge for a change of scenery. I feel that this is the best area in the Riviera Maya as far as being mobile .......there are actually sidewalks out front of the hotel and you can easily walk downtown if it's not too hot.......a cab is around $5.00 to get downtown and less than 5 minutes. A great value and wonderful staff.........food was very good as well. Rooms all have liquor dispensers in them and are nicely appointed. You must make reservations for the specialty restaurants/I'm not a fan of that .....however, don't let that stop you from picking this resort.

After staying at the Riu Playacar last year, we wanted to return to the Riu resorts. The \"palace\" resorts are much nicer than the Playacar, Tequila and Yucatan. Plus, if you stay at either of the Riu \"Palace\" resorts (Riviera Maya or Mexico) you can \"play\" at any of these. If you are trying to decide between the Riviera Maya or the Mexico...I think the RM is the better of the two. Much more atmosphere, better pool and beach. The food was great! We choose the buffet most nights for diner because of the variety. The Brazilian steakhouse was good...not great. The fusion restaurant was ok. We didn't try any of the others. Breakfast was top-notch every morning. I enjoyed \"eating around the world\" every morning by following people from different countries, filling my plate with some of the same items they chose to have. Lunch was always good as well. One highlight of this year\u2019s trip was that the wine was much better than what we were served at the Playacar last year. Top shelf liquor was served at all of the bars, all you have to do is ask for it. One issue I had was the dress code. The Riu has a policy that you cannot wear shorts in any of the theme restraints but they let people do it all the time. That\u2019s OK with me just let your guests know that it is fine. I packed several pairs of pants and two sets of dress shoes and would have liked to have the extra space in my luggage. The room was good. The beds are a little hard but after a long day of sun and fun, I never had trouble getting a good night\u2019s rest. The bathroom could use some updates as others have mentioned. AC worked fine and we never smelled the \"musty\" odor that some complain about. We used the safe in our room but never really worried about theft. On many occasions, I accidentally left my expensive watch out on the nightstand and it was never touched. I'm not saying it doesn't happen...just that it isn't something that we ever worried about. The service at this resort is excellent. Thanks to Jesus and Islas at the lobby bar, cocktail servers Swemi and Paty, Guillermo at the front desk, breakfast and lunch server Janet and Gustavo for dinner at the buffet. All of these great people made our trip even more special by providing great service day after day. These folks work very hard for everyone, even the rude and obnoxious. Go into Playa and experience the city. It is completely safe and the Mexican people are wonderful. I know this sounds funny but one our favorite things to do in Playa is go to Wal Mart! Not only can you buy vanilla, mexican coffee, tequila and snacks at lower prices...but you get to see all the different produce, meats and seafood. We also had dinner in town one night at Wicky's and lunch on the beach at La Tarraya (see my review on TA for these places). You don't have to go to Tulum or Chichen Itza for excursions...just wander into town. I would recommend this place to everyone and go back in a heartbeat.

Rooms are a nice size there was three of us in the room and there was plenty of room. Like all the Riu's they have a stocked fridge with pop, beer, water...they also put a large bottle of water in the bathroom everyday please remember to use this when brushing teeth...do not use the tap water other then bathing. FOOD: The food is the best I have had at an all inclusive (we all agreed on that)!! Most places I have went in Mexico I hated the wine but they gave us a choice of Mexican or Chilean wine and hands down the Chilean wine was the best. Actually liked it!!! STAFF: The staff is fantastic I mean they could not do enough for everyone; they serve you around the pool and on the beach and are always asking you day and night if all is ok. The entertainment is ongoing and always something...loved the beach party. LOCATION: The location of the hotel is great we took a cab into Playa Del Carmen a couple times (5 min cab ride at the most) to shop and the night before we left went to a great Italian restaurant on 5th Ave. You could also walk (about 20 min walk) We also went into Playa Del Carmen to catch the Ferry to Cozumel ...rented a jeep in Cozumel for the day and went around the island... :) THE BEACH: The beach is fantastic, tons of loungers, beautiful white sand and the swimming is great. Personally I think the Riu Palace Riviera Maya has the best beach. I seriously do not have one complaint about this place it was ABSOLUTLY PARADISE!!

The first impression of the Riu was beautiful walking thru the lobby. Our check-in was not so easy though. First we were required to present a \"print out\" of proof for our rooms when they clearly had our names on their computer. A few people (Vanessa) at the front desk were extremly rude and not willing to budge in any way to work with us. I have never experienced such rudeness before and was so mad I wanted to switch hotels because of her treatment. We resolved our issue 2 hrs later but for the rest of the week I refused to even go to the front desk if she was there. We also had the wrath of the travel agents literally fighting over us. (Apple and Cheap Carribean) This is my 6th time to MX and know from experience tell the agents no thank you and your not interested and they don't bother you the rest of the week. Well apparently not at the RIU. Our agent basically was refusing to agree to sign our travel transportation unless we sat thru her 2-3 hour presentation. I flat out told her NO which was very obvious she was ticked but finally agreed to sign. Again not very happy with the treatment. This is something RIU should address because it is a definite turn off as I heard from many guest in the pool, dinner, etc. The rooms were nice and clean but were old and need to be updated. The bathroom is old with a tub you have to step over a good foot and half wall to get in to. I can see where this could be a problem for someone with hip problems or an elderly person. The room (1117) was cleaned daily. We did have little ants one day coming out of the bench, called the front desk who immediately sent someone with a Raid can to spray. She left the can for us if we found anymore which we never did. The bed was very comfortable for us. One of the other rooms the bed was hard as a rock. We called the front desk who sent maid service to make the bed with a mattress pad which made a huge difference. Our AC seemed to be off thru out the day for the first couple of days. By the 3rd day maintenance came to our room to check and had advised if the sliding door is opened for any reason the AC automatically shuts off. (this was never told to us at check-in) Make sure the sliding door is shut tight and the key is in lock position. You will hear the AC kick on as soon as it locks. Another point to remember is there are two buttons next to the inside of your door. One has a red light on it which if turned off will shut off the power to your room. So remember not to hit when leaving your room. Rooms overlooking the main area outside can be loud at night because of the shows and music that go on until 11:30. If you are a light sleeper ask for a room closer to the pool end or facing the opposite side of hotel. This makes a big difference in noise. All rooms are basically the same it just a matter of where your facing and how big your patio is. We had a Jr. Suite Superior but were facing the side of the Chili's restaurant. No big deal because I liked it quite and slept very well all week. The pool is nice but could also be bigger. Since we were visiting during low peak season the hotel was at a 1/3 full with not a full crowd. I can see how this could become very crowded in the summer if full since it's not very large. The beach is beautiful and plenty of chairs. This is the first beach I didn't have to worry about sand bags and rocks. There is a cookout on the beach one day with fresh coconut drinks. You can walk to the other RIU's from the beach which is anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. The RPRM is definitely the nicest of all the hotels. We checked out the other hotels and found them to be older and smaller. The food was very good and never had any trouble with getting sick. The service is excellent and all of the staff (outside of the front desk) will go out of their way to get you anything. I noticed a lot of people did not tip which is not expected but is greatly appreciated. There were couples who made arrangements for a special setup (flowers on table, champagne, etc) and waiters would go out of their way with exceptional service. I was so impressed with their attitudes even after the guest would just get up without leaving a tip much less a thank you. We were offered a red wine (Deavalo) which was good and not offered to everyone unless you ask for it. Make sure you ask for it....much better than the red wine provided. The buffett was excellent and fresh daily. The Chili's restaurant is good and open during the day for quick bites. The Brazlian is good but lots of meat. (like 7 different kinds) The Mexican is ok but honestly the buffet gave a better selection and much better. The Habachi was good but disappointed they dont cook in front of you. Chili's at night is a steak restaurant and was good as well. Sorry this is so long but felt compelled to give my honest review of the hotel. I enjoyed it but not sure if I we will go back. We went to Riveria Princess last year and it's just so hard not to compare swim up suites to an outdated room. My tips are: - Call for a mattress pad if bed is too hard - If AC is off make sure the sliding door is closed and locked - If no hot water call the front desk; it will be on within 5 minutes - Ask for Deavalo wine. It is not offered unless you ask for it - Get a cab from the guy at the front door. Travel agents will overcharge you - Buy your tickets to any tours online if you can. Agents are expensive. Don't do the pkg deals...way too expensive thru an agent. - Go to Tulum and visit the ruins and beach. The most beautiful beach you will ever see", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cRPRM- Will Return!\u201d", "Author": "GaVol", "ReviewID": "UR119449294", "Content": "Short and Sweet- One place I would definitely go back to!

I went to Playa Del Carmen in October of 2008 and stayed at the Riu Palace. At that time it was just over a year old and it showed. The grounds were immaculate and the staff super friendly. The resort lobby was pretty impressive and ornate. The resort was walking distance from the shopping district with an outdoor mall and you can even take a ferry (which we did) over to Cozumel! The room wasn't quite as impressive, however, but still pretty nice. The room seemed a bit small for a 5 star resort, the bed was a little hard (that seems to be a pretty general consensus among the other reviews I've read), but the view was pretty awesome so it was fine. There was a couple of steps down from the main \"bedroom\" area to a sitting area with a couch and TV. There was a little half-wall dividing the \"bedroom\" and \"sitting area\" which was covered with crayon some previous guest's child had obviously had some fun with. I was a little disappointed in that...but that was my only real concern with the rooms in terms of tidiness. The courtyard of the resort was awesome! Fountains, green grass, flowers, and pools. It definitly did the pictures on their website justice. The swim up bar was a frequent stop for us, and although the drinks were a lot lower quality than the drinks at the lobby bar, it was still a pleasant thing to have while relaxing in the pool. The white sands beach was pretty awesome too. Bluest water I've ever seen! My wife and I did get hit up to buy marijuana from some guy on the beach which we thought was pretty inappropriate but the guy was pretty jolly and didn't make us uncomfortable. Since this resort is all-inclusive the food has to be mentioned...and I'm happy to say that was one of my favorite parts! I'm a bit of a picky eater, very picky actually, and find myself refusing to go to several restaurants in my area because the food just isn't very good. The resort offered a few \"restaurants\" that you set reservations for on a daily basis and were more \"dress up\" than the buffet. Due to limited selection (whatever they were serving the night you went was all you had to choose from) we ended up enjoying the buffet more than the restaurants. All of the food was really good. One evening they served beef wellington at the buffet (one of my favorites) and it was excellent! I would definitely recommend eating at the resort when you go and saving money (besides, why else did you go to an all inclusive resort??). All in all it was a very pleasant stay and I would definitely stay there again, or any Riu property, as I feel they do a great job with their hotels and their guests.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cGreat if you want to lose weight from Vomiting & Diarrhoea\u201d", "Author": "mikeymikeyuk", "ReviewID": "UR119323602", "Content": "This was a very disappointing holiday for us at this hotel as we all became very ill during our stay. There we 6 of us in our group & 4 of us became ill from a parasite found in the water or the food here (Entamoeba Histolytica) Amoebiasis. This has been confirmed from our UK doctor within days on returning home. We became very ill during our stay with severe vomiting & Diarrhoea lasting several days. This matter was brought to the attention of the hotel staff before we left, we gave all our details & our symptoms on a special form given to us by a smiley & very sarcastic male receptionist & we have heard nothing from Riu since about this matter which is quite frankly disgusting. Surely this sort of thing should be dealt with a matter of urgency if guests are becoming ill at the hotel. We only ate food from here & had drinks here, hence it is a 24 hour all inclusive resort. Perhaps it was the water we used to brush our teeth or ice in the drinks or the even food, we do not know for sure the exact source of this parasite, all we know is we caught it here. When we arrived here we were greeted by a curt receptionist who could not understand even the most basic English language, we were not shown to our rooms either. The hotel was very clean in the lobby/corridor areas & first impressions were quite good in general. The rooms are the standard kind of \u2018Riu\u2019 basic that you get, nothing spectacular or modern in anyway. Riu really need to invest some money in their hotel rooms. The rooms that Thomson are allocated have no view, they are all at the back of the hotel. The pool & beach area is very nice however perhaps a lot of money is spent here when it could be spent on the rooms & food. The pool area was not relaxing as there was an annoying entertainment team constantly on the loud microphone, the beach was the only option to try & get away from this. The service & the staff in this hotel were on average ok but came no-where near to the service & friendliness of the Riu Palace Las Americas the year before. Some of that staff ignored requests made for extra water, bedlinen, food etc to the room. Drinks orders were very slow & the bar inside the hotel was understaffed especially when the weather took a turn for the worst. The restaurants were ok but again you cannot compare them the Riu Palace Las Americas in Cancun, the standard of food is not as good, neither is the service. No choice of wines were given even though there were 3 of each. The booking system is ridiculous for these restaurants, you have to queue between certain times. The sports bar is dank & dingy & dirty, not a place you\u2019d want to go for drink or eat food at any stage. We have stayed at Riu hotels many times before, had this been the first Riu hotel we had ever stayed at then we would not ever return.

Lots of houses and other hotels, a very nice area. You can walk into Playa Del Carmen from the hotel, takes about a 15 min slow walk. We walked down 5th Avenue which is full of shops, bars and restaurants. Lots of jewellery shops, etc but if you want Silver, buy it off the people walking up and down the beach. Check that it's stamped (which most of it is), and you will get some great bargains. I have been twice and always bought from them, they still look brand new to this day. THE ROOMS Suites are large with lots of space for you clothes, a king size bed (or 2 double beds pushed together), a sitting area, optics, and minibar. The maids do an excellent job on keeping the rooms clean and fresh everyday, including turning your bed down at night and giving you more fresh towels...including a little Hershey Kiss chocolate on your pillow. They always tidied up our shoes, or if something was just laid on the side they would fold it up. One day we had a dirty sheet, I phoned reception and someone was there within 2 minutes...they were so apologetic, they didn't just change the one sheet they stripped the whole bed and did it all again. RESTAURANTS We ate in all the restaurants and they were all great. Some were better than others, but that was just our personal preference rather than there being anything wrong with the food. We particularly enjoyed Krystal, which is more of a fine dining restaurant, also the Japanese restaurant was very good. The buffet was also fab, you could really want for nothing. The service was exceptional too, the waiters constantly making sure you had water, wine etc. POOL/BEACH The pool bar area wasn't great. However, this seemed to be down to 2 things. 1) There was a very horrible smell coming from the bar, it smelt like sour milk and was pretty gross. 2) People in the pool bar (guest) were putting out cigars in the water, dropping drinks, nachos etc in the water. The bottom of the pool was cleaned with one of those hoover things, but to be honest it could do with a really good scrub. Especially the tiles etc around the pool. We tried the scuba diving in the pool, it was very good and well worth a go if you haven't done it before. The Beach was lovely white sand, lots of beds. The shade on the beach is basically the trees. Which for someone who burns was enough. You can just move your bed accordingly as the day goes on. OVERALL It was a really,really good hotel. A few little niggles - you get towel cards which I dont like, you have to book the Al a carte restaurants for the up to 2 nights in advance, and more often than not you get their own branded drinks. Some international drinks they don't stock..such as Jack Daniels etc. To be honest that was my only real quibbles about the hotel. Having said that, I wouldn't stay here again. Only because we have stayed somewhere else in Mexico that was better, and we really preferred it to the RIU. However, the RIU is still a great place to stay.

We e-mailed the resort letting them know it was our 10th anniversary. they gave us an amazing room with ocean views right by the pool. Whenever we needed anything in our room it was there when we got back. We requested breakfast at 7:10 am because we had to get a shuttle to go to coba (Mayan village where they still speak Mayan!) It showed up at 7:11! And that was with special requests. In the first hour of us being there, several of the management staff welcomed us and made sure to let us know if there was anything that we needed, to let them know. wherever we sat down throughout the lobby, common areas, immediately there was a waiter to ask us if we needed another drink. I don't think there was 1 time when I sat with an empty drink. As far as the sports bar is concerned, The staff there was bar none the best I have ever dealt with. One of the bartenders took time out to teach us Spanish in between making drinks and making everyone feel like they were old friends. I have never dealt with a friendlier harder working group of people. We actually gave one of the bartenders our contact info to keep in touch with him. And as in some of the reviews we read before choosing RPRM, the food in some of the restaurants wasn't excellent. Most of it was good, not great. But we didn't go there for the food. Krystal was excellent. The Ala cart restaurants are fairly small, so it is good to get down to the lobby to sign up for the restaurants right when they start taking reservations.The buffet was hit or miss, but overall pretty good. And the fact that you can visit, eat and use all of the facilities ant any of the other RIU is a bonus.We made res at palace Mexico when we couldn't get them at ours. Oh yeah, the coffee was really bad. but we knew that going in so we brought our own with us so that wasn't a problem. if you do, don't forget coffee filters or bring the Starbucks via instant. We were actually amazed at how clean everything was considering we were on a beach with sand and there was never any sand anywhere but on the beach. Then when walking around late night, there were staff with brooms meticulously sweeping and mopping all of the walkways and stairs. We will definitely go back there again. Just like one of the other reviewers said, we travel quite a bit and we never go to the same place twice in a row, but we are considering going back for our next vacation. To sum it up, No place is perfect. We never go into something like this too high expectations. We were pleasantly surprised with just about everything we experienced at this resort. As I said in opening, the best vacation I have ever been on. I would highly recommend this place. I have to mention, Everyone of the staff was great, but we spent a lot of our time in the sports bar because of the wonderful bartenders that worked there. Victor worked evening to midnight,, and pancho worked from midnight to 7 am. they both were hands down our favorite people on the staff at the palace. We would go back there if only just to see them and see how they are doing. I really feel like they are friends of ours. I would say that most of the people that spend any time in the sports bar feel that way as well.

We selected this resort based on that recommendation as well as the reviews on Trip Advisor. Com. This trip was a last family trip for sometime as my son leaves for military service in November and so we looked forward to this to being a special time for the 4 of us. We have all been to this area before, actually twice, but the first time at this property. But a 4 star, AAA property, are you kidding me? I would strongly argue this is NOT the case, so let me explain. Check in. We arrived and were not greeted by a welcome drink. (No biggie, I guess) We were assigned our rooms (2) and were not shown how to get to them. I had requested, via a direct call to the hotel a week before our arrival that our rooms be connecting. I had requested the same in the reservation and was told at the time we made the reservation that connecting rooms were possible. From what I understood when we arrived, there are no connecting rooms, but there are rooms that share a common main entrance to the hallway, but we could not even get that. I had requested in my call that we not be located near the entertainment area rather near the pool, which we were not. The entertainment went every night until 11 PM. Good luck trying to sleep. The lady who checked us in could have cared less about us, she was curt and otherwise could have cared less about our satisfaction and hence we had to find our rooms as mentioned earlier. We arrived to find out that there was no restaurants open and it was now 4:00 PM and we had not eaten since breakfast. We were told to go to the Sports Bar, which we did. The place was dirty, the food was premade and you warmed it in a microwave that was not dirty, it was filthy as was the Sports Bar. The staff person at the bar could have cared less about us. When I asked for mustard for a microwave hot dog, he looked at me and said \u201cno mustard, only Mayo\u201d Overall the food was disgusting in the Sports Bar and the hotel should not even attempted to serve it to anyone. This bar should be shut down. Upon check in we inquired about making dinner reservations for the restaurants. We were told that you could only make reservations between 12 noon and 3:00 PM daily, in person near the lobby. I find this to rather restrictive and not all guest friendly. Never a word about how we could use our $25 resort spa credit. Rooms. We did get the bedding types we requested, I king and 1 with 2 doubles. I asked 3 times for mattress /bed pads since I know the beds are not very comfortable. Finally got them. But here is yet another case where I requested this before we even arrived. By day 2 there were ants in one of our rooms. Went to the front desk and asked to be moved because of the ants and because of the noise at night. We moved the next day after they processed check outs for the day. We were moved to rooms that were across from each other that did share the common door to the hallway as we had originally requested and they were near the pool and away from the nightly entertainment. New rooms, no towels. Had to call 3 times to finally get them. Our bed cushions from our first rooms were not moved as I had requested at the front desk and instead they put new ones on that were worse than sleeping directly on the mattress. The in room refrigerator had an open bottle of water left in it from the people who were there before us so one had cleaned it before we moved in. We requested additional water several times, but it never arrived. The bottle of liquor that was missing from the dispenser was never replaced. Black mold was every where in our shower. Easy to keep under control in this climate with a little bleach each day. Front Desk Staff. Some tried hard to help and some did a good job for the most part. Others like Nathalie could have cared less about you. In fact, we had an issue we talked to her about. She went into the back room to tell someone and came back out, all within a minute or so and when she returned, she completely ignored us. Never said someone will be right with you, never said no one will help you, never said a word, just ignored us until I asked what was going on and she said \u201coh, I forgot about you\u201d Now I am 6\u20194\u201d so I am not an easy guy to forget or then again, maybe I am. Pool Area. Went down the first day, they were out of towels and we were told come to come back in 30 minutes or so. The pool itself needs some TLC. The assist handles going into /out of the pool are about ready to fall over. Tiles are missing everywhere in the pool. The dive instructor, Daniel, who gives you a brief free scuba lesson, is a great guy! Knowledgeable and puts you at ease. Resort Overview. Maids and other room staff were great and really tried hard to please. You cannot charge anything anywhere in the resort to your room, so you need to either carry money or a credit card. Most inconvenient. The people at the water sports hut were great to work with, especially the lady who runs it. The gym had water leaking, no actually running from the ceiling as you entered. This was not just 1 day, it was every day, so they had towels down to soak it up. Now I know why there were no towels at the pool! The gym equipment is in bad shape. The weight machine has a pulley belt which is frayed to the point where it\u2019s about worn through. Dangerous situation. The food overall was good. The buffets were changed up nightly and most everything appeared fresh. Overall the wait staff was good to excellent. We did eat in 2 of the theme restaurants, the Yashima Japanese and the Brazilian Rodizio. The Japanese was outstanding as was the service. The other had way too much food, but none the less very good. The service was so, so. Did not attend any of the nightly entertainment, but none the less you could hear it pretty much any where around the resort. Started early and went to 11:00 PM every night. It was held in a semi open air environment, so that\u2019s why you could hear it. So you do not want a room near this location, which is near the restaurants unless you don\u2019t want to fall sleep until after 11 at night. Lastly, Hotel Management. Ok, so here is the topper to the whole visit. On Monday night the resort had invited in local artist to set up booths near the restaurants and the main court yard. We found a local artist who did unusual paintings on tile using is fingers. I asked him to do a custom piece for us, which he gladly did. We are not talking about a lot of money, $20.00 and took him about 2 hours since it was a special request, but none the less the painting turned out just the way we envisioned it and we were very happy with it. The next day we left it in our room to dry. I came up from the beach after the maid had been in the room and found she had placed a piece of paper, which had been laying next to the painting on top of the wet painting and then set a roll of tape, also laying next to the painting, on top of the paper. I was able to remove the paper, but there was damage to the painting. I took the painting, paper and tape to the front desk and spoke with Aaron who was, as I understand it an assistant manager of the hotel. I should point out here that if you asked to speak to the manager; he was always \u201cOut\u201d and was given to some assistant. I explained what had happened and he said that he would contact the artist, since I had his cell phone number on the paper that was placed on top of the wet painting and he would get him in to touch it up. This was about 3:00 PM. I went back around 5 or so and Aaron told me that the artist was in the area and he was going to have him come by. The next day, Wednesday, I went back up to front desk in the AM to speak with Aaron, but it was his day off. Now the day before he said nothing about being off Wednesday and he also knew that we were going to leave Thursday in the AM, so the touch up had to get completed by Wednesday at the latest. So I asked Nathalie, a front desk staff person if I could speak to the manager since Aaron was gone. She told me the manager was out. I asked about my painting and she disappeared into the back and came out with it. Come to find out nothing had been done to fix it. So again I asked to speak with the manager and again was told he was not in. So I asked for an assistant manager and Jose Wis appeared. He did not know anything about the situation, so I explained everything to him and he said he would try and reach the artist. I checked back later in the day and he said he had not reached the artist. Checked back after that and still no resolution so again I asked to speak to the manager. This time Jose told he was on property and he would try to reach him via his radio. Several minutes went by and Jose came out said he could not reach him, so he was going to send someone to look for him. 15/20 minutes went by. My wife and I are sitting and waiting for the manager and we see a man walk into the manager\u2019s office and the light goes on. A few minutes go by Jose walks over to where we are sitting and simply states to me the manager, Xavier Saez will not see us. No reason. I ask again and he once again tells me the manager will not see us. I then ask about my painting and he tells us to leave it there and they will take care of. (Sure, I will\u2026\u2026\u2026I know how this would turn out. Your gone so no need to take care of this) Ok, I have traveled throughout this country from coast to coast and to other countries including Asia, and others. In all of my travels, in all of the hotels I have stayed at from 2 star to 5 star, any time I have asked to speak to a hotel manager I have always been able to do so, whether it was right at the moment or through an arranged time. This place is different as we had asked to speak with him before on the room issue and were once again not able to. Apparently Mr. Saez feels that he is either one, to busy to speak to a guest that has a real issue that needs his attention or two, he just does not care about his guest or third, he did not want to deal with my frustration regarding the issue with the painting or maybe I was a pain in the back side that he would rather not have to deal with. Don\u2019t really know? Whatever the reason for his complete lack of caring, it\u2019s clear to me that guest satisfaction, recommendations and repeat business is not high on his list of objectives. Not talking to his guest is. All in all, I would maybe rate this hotel a 3 star and knock it down to a 2 star based on the manager, some of the front desk staff and overall condition. Would I go back, not only no, but h*** no! The 2 upscale Barcel\u00f3 properties were much nicer and much friendlier.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cCant wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "loves2travel7", "ReviewID": "UR118692485", "Content": "This was our second visit to this hotel and it was wonderful once again.

If you ask for the top shelf, you will get it without hesitation. We are a couple in our late 20's and the hotel has pretty much nothing to do after around 11pm. The entertainment staff took those interested in going out to clubs which were maybe 10 minutes away ($7 cab ride). These outings were well worth it and the entertainment staff makes sure that you are well taken care of in the clubs.

My girlfriend and I had a great time and would love to go back. (Note: we stayed back at the end of May... a little slow in writing this review). We were initially recommended by my brother, who had stayed previously, and were more than pleased with the stay. FOOD: Right on par with the other Riu's that I've stayed at (Riu Palace Cancun and Riu Cabo Santa Fe). For the most part, it's exactly what you'd expect for an all-inclusive hotel in Mexico... The buffets are decent and the separate restaurants have some good menu options at each. Our favorite was the Japanese one... Ask your waiter for the sake bomb! In terms of making reservations, we never really had a problem making those (except we were never able to get the Krystal restaurant). POOLS/BEACH: The main pool was okay, but was a bit \"cloudy.\u201d The beach is nice, with a bunch a chairs and a volleyball court. However, the best part of the beach was actually up closer to the pool where you can relax under the palm trees, especially nice when the sun was super-hot. The water was nice and very calm without many waves. On the beach, you can walk to a number of different Riu hotels (since you're staying at a Palace, you can get drinks from all other Rius). In the other direction, you can walk all the way to the town of Playa del Carmen via the beach (about 20-30 min walk). BARS: If you're looking for a rowdy bar scene, this is not the place. The hotel has a very nice courtyard where folks sit at tables drinking at night. The main draw was actually the \"show\" that the staff puts on every night. Can be kitschy but entertaining none the less (especially when you've got a few drinks in you). At night, it was always nicer to drink outside, rather than in one of the bars (we thought the lobby bar was a bit \"stuffy\"). ROOMS: Nice rooms... If you've ever stayed at a Riu before, you're getting the same rooms here, too. We had a room on the outside without a sea view. In our opinion, not really worth paying extra for the \"ocean view\" rooms because we actually had more privacy on our side, especially when relaxing and drinking some cocktails out on the balcony. ACTIVITES/TOWN: You can walk into town from the hotel. It takes about 20-25 minutes, but if it's hot, it feels like longer. The town of Playa del Carmen is nice. The main \"strip\" is about 10-15 blocks of stores, restaurants, bars, etc. Nice to stroll down and you can pretty much do the town in one afternoon. We also took the ferry over to Cozumel. When you're at the pier, be ready to face the gauntlet of people trying to get you to rent a jeep and what not. If you plan on renting a jeep on Cozumel, would recommend having it pre-arranged before you make your way onto the ferry because it's a bit chaotic when you're there. Cozumel is nice (water is near the top of clearest I've ever seen), but there's only so much you can do on foot. If you go to the island, would recommend getting a jeep/scooter to make your way around the island, or go with an excursion group. We also did an snorkeling excursion called Deja Vu (we booked through Olympus tours). Highly recommend! A bus picks you up in the morning and takes the group down to a marina near Tulum. The reason we liked it so much was that the tour only took out 8 people at a time (make sure to book early in the week, b/c it will sell out). The captain, Roberto, is a great guy. He takes you out to a couple of spots to snorkel with sea turtles, coral reef, etc. Also, you'll go to a cove with fresh water fed cenotes. You also get a light lunch, as well. Great time!

Beach - We loved the beach and how beautiful it was. I loved that we could walk down the beach for as far as you could see in both directions. It was easy to get to the other beach front Rius and into PDC. I am not exactly sure how far PDC is but it took us about 20 minutes and about 10 to get to the closest other Riu when heading south. The pool bar (Daquiri) was fun but I think that is really a factor of who else is at the resort at that time. We wished it had stayed open a little later, it closed at 5:30pm. Loved Tavo and Tony, excellent bartenders. Love that the pool bar has little seats with tables. You could see the ocean from various locations in the pool not sure if you could from the other Rius. Entertainment staff - Good but not pushy, by the same token if you are looking for events all day long, this did not happen. There was volleyball twice a day, water-aerobics, bingo. There were also some activities on the beach Futbol(Soccer), beach volleyball. We never saw water-polo or dancing at our resort but did down at Riu Playacar. Entertainment area - The area where the shows are presented each evening has it's own wrap-around bar, this is a nice area to be in because you can still carry on a conversation and also watch the entertainment. Note - you do not need to be a drinker to hang out there; there were a lot of people having non-alcoholic drinks. The food in the buffet was really good, this was the third all inclusive we had been to in the past 1 1/2 years and it was the first time John liked the food. We loved the Steak place, Chili's, try the Baked Alaska, it's worth it for presentation alone. We did not care for the Fusion restaurant BUT met people there from the states who loved it so it may have been an off night. I had Seabass and it was undercooked, my comment was if I wanted sushi I would have ordered it but they were very attentive and I should have sent it back. Breakfast inside started at 7 am and the outside restaurant did not serve until 10 am. Lunch \"started\" at noon but they typically did not have all the food out yet. They also had grilling on the beach three days. They serve lunch both outside at Chili\u2019s and in the main buffet. They will cook your eggs to order. I prefer mine over easy but not over cooked - No problem they made me new ones. Weather was fantastic 85+ and sunny, even though weather.com had called for 30-60% rain everyday, it only rained twice once it began about 3:30 in the afternoon one day and did last a few hours and another it rained about 5 am and was done by 6. Entertainment - I know Monday was Movie theme (it was good), Tuesday was Las Vegas (didn't see it), Wednesday was Circus (lame), Thursday was A Mexican theme but it may have been a special event (appears this was a special event). They had a really fun Mexican Party... Another person we met said that the entertainment was completely different the week before. I do not know if that is true but may be because most of the Europeans we met were there for two weeks. I'm not sure if I could have handled that much alcohol. Also, we enjoyed going to the other hotels but liked ours overall the best. By far, RPRM had the widest beachfront of the four. As John said, there were certain items from each hotel we wished we could have combined. Such as bring the beach bar from Riu Mexico, the pool bar hours from Playacar, the three outside bars of Yucatan, the book exchange at all three, the activities of Playacar.

Made no different to us, we simply didn't unpack until the following day. Rooms. - firstly have to say that on all of our three visits we have never once seen cockroaches and we have stayed on all thee floors. Maids come in daily to make the beds up, clean and change the towels (even though we put them to use again rather than in the bath which indicates that we want them changing). First Sunday we were there the room wasn't cleaned, we don't make a mess and really the only thing we would like on a daily basis is the bed making. The bed was made that day by the maid who came to turn down the bed. If it really bothered us we would have just called reception and got someone to clean the room then The second Sunday the room was cleaned but no towels were left, however a quick call to reception and fresh towels were delivered in five mins. food - the buffet restaurant was where we ate mostly during the evening. the staff there are great and are very attentive. Food is varied, there are always a couple of choices of joints of meat, fish, soup, salads, vegetables, pizzas, local dishes as well as on the speciality nights where you will have chefs who will make pasta, etc to your preferences. However we were disappointed that the speciality menus in the other restaurants were the same as 12 months ago. We tried krystals, the Japanese, the Mexican and steakhouse restaurants. Have to say that apart from the Japanese the serve we had was below par. Every week you will be asked to fill in a customer survey form. We noted this lack of service and the head waiter questioned us about this as he saw that we had made comments in the service box. He said that if we had any issues we should have spoken to him about it, but a) I didn't know he was the head man and b) he was never in those restaurants. I have to say that I would put this down to lack of experience possibly as the faces we recognised gave us a high level of service. We did tend to use the beach more than the pool, when we did use the pool we had no issues with the cleanliness of the area there was always someone sweeping up or tidying the gardens. I would recommend this hotel/area as being a gated resort it does give you the feeling of being very safe even when you walk to the other hotels at night.

We checked in quickly. They give us a good drink during our check in :) We found ppl who work there very friendly during our entire stay. Room: They gave us a room on the 1 floor and when I booked a month before I asked for a room on the second or third floor. They change us the next day. I found the room ok, but definitely needs some touch-up and upgrades especially in the bathroom. I found some discusting kind of cockroaches in the bathroom almost every night. Not very fun!! The maid did a really good cleaning job everyday and it was great to have water and alcohol was the min-bar is. Beach and pools: The beach in front of the resort was gorgeous. The pools were very hot during the day so I was always in the ocean all day long...and for ppl who wants activity; they have volleyball in the pool. There's also the animation around the pool all day long and really good reggaeton and dance music. Drinks/food: After 2 days, I was going crazy, the food for breakfast and lunch are always the same.... good for the first day or two but after that it was not really interesting to go eat. And it's not because they don't have a lot of choice, it's full of food in their buffet! I have to admit that I\u2019m not a big fan of buffet too but anyways, to me the variety of good and decent food was limited. It sucks that they don't have an a la carte restaurant for lunch. We booked the a la carte diner every night so we've tried every restaurant that they have. They were all good but the French and Japanese were the best. The room service menu was very very limited and not really good :(( The drinks were really water down and after 4-5 daiquiris you have 0 feeling! Believe me. The ones that the guy made at the entrance in the hall were better and had more alcohol. Thank god....and you can also drink really late at night! That\u2019s a good thing :) Location: They are located in the Playacar district witch is 5-10 minutes from playa Del Carmen downtown. They also have a really great beach in this area. Way better than Riviera Maya. I would say it's far a bit from the airport (50 minutes) but nothing to worry about. During our entire stay, we found the staff very friendly and helpful. This hotel is very clean but unfortunately needs some upgrades and touch-up in the room... I found that for the price we paid, the Royal Hideaway or Secrets Capri could had been a way better place to stay especially with the food they had in the buffet for lunch and breakfast and drinks with almost no alcohol in it. Something that really surprised us was the fact that almost nobody tip at this hotel... Like wtf! We tipped for breakfast; lunch and diner, in the room everyday and for drinks... at least leave a dollar.

My wife and I never took all inclusive trips before as we decided to go with our friends. We were hesitant at first due to the travel advisory to Mexico, but I did a lot of research and decided it was safe for us to go for a 7 nights trip. The deal we got was great, ended up being less than $100 USD a night. Our first impression was grand, it was indeed a palace, spacious and beautiful. The room was spacious (we got the junior suite), can easily fit 3 people if needed. The hotel staff was very friendly and the service was superb; I was shocked the first night when a waiter pulled out my chair for me and offered to take my plates of food to the table. I would definitely say the all inclusive is a must as we felt like Kings and Queens there, ordering anything anywhere, always someone friendly to help you out. There's just so much wonderful things to say about the place, but I'll keep it short and to the point. The buffet was amazing, breakfast, lunch and dinner all were great and changes daily. The A la Carte was very good, but the only knock was that it was very hard to book them, so we only tried two of them. The swimming pool and the ocean front was glorious, it made you feel special for sure. We actually walked the full strip, ocean front and the road side and all had agreed that this was the best hotel out of them all. You can't possibley go wrong with this selection. Last thought...

FOOD - The buffet food was as good as I could expect from a buffet. It was usually cooked well and the selection at both buffets was huge, so you could change up your selections a lot if you wanted to from night to night. I also made reservations for the steak restaurant one night - overall it was quite good, although I asked for my steak medium and it was pretty much well done. The service was very good. I also ate in the Brazilian restaurant and definitely recommend it - the food and service were top notch. I didn't get sick in any way from the food or drinks from any of the resurants, buffets or bars. ROOM - The room was pretty much what I expected from the description and photos and I was happy with most aspects of it. It was large and spacious and while the bed was firm, I didn't find it \"rock hard\" as others have commented. I did dislike the plastic type cover under the sheet that kind of squeaked when you moved around. I saw absolutely no bugs during my stay. The maids came daily and did a very good job keeping things clean and leaving a different towel art thingy on your bed. But...I guess it's not the maid's fault, but some of the towels and linens were offputting. You could tell they had just been washed, but they had permanent stains on them...they should obviously toss these and not re-use them. I had a 3rd floor room facing the courtyard, with a nice balcony and wonderful view. Be aware that if you want to sleep before 11 pm, do not get a room facing the courtyard. I was halfway between the lobby end and beach end and the evenings begin with a band playing in the courtyard, followed by the nightly entertainment in the theatre. You can hear everything and most people won't be able to sleep while it's going on. I didn't care much because I don't usually go to sleep until late. PROPERTY/BEACH/POOL - The lobby, restaurants, courtyard and grounds all looked amazing to me...quite fancy, well kept, maintained and cleaned. The pool was pretty good, but I think it could be a little bigger for the number of people that stay there. It was really packed in the afternoons, but strolling out around 9 am., there seemed to be plenty of chairs available. The beach was amazing in my opinion...just beautiful...so that is where I hung out most of the time. There's a section where you could find plenty of shade under palm trees and a huge section of open beach if you wanted to be fully exposed to the sun. I never had a problem finding a chair, but I was usually out there by 10 am. The water was clear and blue and a good temperature to cool off a bit when I was there. No waves if you are into boogie boarding though...it's really just for swimming around and cooling off. SERVICE/STAFF: The service was really good and almost all the staff I encountered were extremely friendly. The exception for me was the Entertainment staff...over 7 days I was never approached by any of them to see if I wanted to participate in an activity. I was usually alone and reading, so maybe they figured I didn't want to be bothered...who knows. Drink service at the beach was hit and miss I found. Finally, just a comment on who I'd recommend this hotel for...this has nothing to do with the quality of the hotel itself, just who I think would have the best time there. I am a 40-year-old male, was there solo and it was not a good hotel for me. Most of the guests were couples, and there were also a number of families there as well (although not too many really young kids overall). There were plenty of guests older than me too. If you are a couple, 30 or older, then I think this hotel would be great for you. If you have young kids, I'd think about going somewhere else. There didn't seem to be much for kids to do there. If you are a group of young singles I'd definitely go somewhere else...I didn't see very many groups of singles and saw absolutely no other solo travellers. Overall, I think the quality of the hotel is quite good. It just wasn't right for me, as I was a solo traveller hoping to come across other solo travellers or singles to socialize with.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "leeds", "Title": "\u201cSecond time here and still 'wow'\u201d", "Author": "noswadLeeds", "ReviewID": "UR117790860", "Content": "Once again we have spent another 2 weeks at the hotel since we thoroughly ejoyed our previous stay in 2009.

The food we could not complain about at all in the buffet restaurant - lots to chose from and some cooked to order for you. The staff well what can I say they - cannot do enough for you both in the restaurants and bars - take time out and actually speak with them - they dont 'bite' and yes we did tip on some days because of the service that we were given during the day. The hotel is cleaned 24 hours aday but shall I say the 'standards' of some guests is appalling, 'let it drop on the floor as the cleaners will pick it up' - no get up and put it in the bin yourself! The lobby bar 'Ilyas' brilliant service has your drink ready for you before you get to the bar now thats service!

Rooms: Nice decor, clean, mini bar with hard alcohol & water-beer-soda. Safe in the closet. Jetted bath tub. Maids always kept it clean (although they did come later in the day) and made towel animals for us...also opened our blankets in the evening and left us hershey's kisses on our pillows!!

Also, getting a lounge chair is easy...plenty to go around. Free non-motorized motor sports which is very nice! Staff: Always willing to please you and get you what is needed. They are all very hardworking & it is sad to say that although he tipped here and there....we did not see many others doing so. Never had a porblem with rudeness or being unfriendly. There was always a person polishing the floor, sweeping or cutting the plants. We went to CocoBongo night club and the entertainment staff went with us and made sure we got in safely!

We stayed at the exclusive adults only resort, but because they had no room for the 4 extra nights, we had to leave, and ended up in Riu Palace. Of course, comparing Riu Palace to where we stayed is silly because there is no way these two resorts are comparable, but I did stay at Riu Playacar a few years ago, so I am comparing these two. Riu Palace is supposedly a higher class than Riu Playacar, and when we stayed at Playacar, we were not allowed to go to Riu Palace. I didn't know why then and after visiting Riu Palace I still do not know why. The food was average, but the cocktails were nice. Our minibar was stocked up with brandy, tequilla, whisky, but no cognac (??) and some very bad mexican beer. Not even a Corona Riu Palace? really? The halls in the hotel were very dark and smelled damp - that was not nice, but the lobby was huge and AC'd and had plenty of lighting. The staff was very nice, I just wish they spoke better English, but oh well. I noticed that when I tipped them, and I tip well, I had extra attention from the staff. That's understandable I guess. What shocked me is that they do not accept $US anymore due to high possibility of fraud Ummm...ok... The pool area is very nice. It's one big and deep pool, and I appreciated the pool bar. There are a lot of palm trees around the pool area, so you had some protection against the sun. But I was aghast when I saw that the beach had nothing to protect against the blistering sun at all. Not umbrellas, not palm trees, not little huts, NOTHING. This has to be one of the biggest drawbacks in this place. They did plant two rows of palm trees, but they are small. They will grow in some years time. What bothered me also were the reservations for the restaurants. They must do something to improve it. I was not able to make a reservation for ANY place for two days, because they were full. There must be a better way to deal with this. Overall, I would not come back to this place.

Our ages ranged from 20-60. We were clebrating three birthdays. I must say after staying at the Riu Sante Fe in Cabo San Lucas, this hotel was 100x better. It could be that this was a palace or even a differant part of Mexico. Upona rriving at the Cancun airport after a much longer dleay than we anticipated, our shuttle was there waiting. We used Best day travel and I really would suggest booking a private transfer. It costs less and you do not need to wiat for other, do drop offs, or pick ups. Since this was a shuttle, we had to leave 3.5 hours earlier than our flight when we left. You pull into the main gate and it is like its own little town. You see all the Riu's and a few more hotels,shops, restaurants, etc. We were greeted with a welcome drink and shown to our rooms. Appearance: Gorgeous lobby and landscape. Rooms were decent. Nothing spectacular in my opinion. The hotel was able to put all 15 of us in the same side of the building which was nice. The pool was very nice and clean. The beach was gorgeous. Food: You had the buffet for breakfast and lunch. The most pickiest eaters could find something they liked. It was great that you could get snacks at the lunch buffet up until 6. We ate at the Mexican, steakhouse, Gourmet, and Asian restaurant. We had to make reservations which we thought would be a problem for 15. Not one issue at all! In the gourmet restaurant we had to split up due to the restaurants size. No big deal. We had 3 birthday celebrations and the restaurant staff always made them very very special. Food was very good at all restaurants. Room service I felt was a bit subpar. Drinks: They had a large assortment. Somewhat top shelf stuff to. You needed to ask them for the top shelf stuff and also if you would like, ask them to double the booze up. Entertainment: Was great! The pool during the day always had some sort of activities. one a few occasions they had beach parties at noon, with dancing , games, etc. At night the shows were ok, some better than others. After the show was over , they would do a a little dance party and get people moving.. If you wanted to continue the party, the Riu Tequila had night club that you could walk to. It wasn't bad. We went twice and it seemed they played the same music every night. Other than that the sports bar at the hotel was opened 24 hours. We went to Coco Bongo one night. One of the entertainment staff came with us to make sure we got in safely, had a good time, and got home safely. I have never seen such a club. it was amzing, so much fun! Service; I can not say enough!!!! Servers were evverywhere, near the pool, shows, lobby. You did not have to get up for anything. Waiters at the restaurant were very proper and efficient. A few shout outs-Santos, Alex, and Jona (entertainment staff) were amazing! They catered to evey need of ours! Our drinks would be half full and there they were with another drink in hand Now the most amazing thing about this service, 9 family members got stuck at the hotel for another week due to the recent hurricane. They were supposed to leave Sunday and could not get a flight out until friday. Seeing their frustration and anxiety about the whole situation-the Riu comped there stays from sun-fri simply because they knew how stressful it was and how the airlines would not do anything about it. That is the type of customer service that would keep me coming back and back. Side notes: every night there is a different alcohol station outside in the plaza: tequila, vodka, champagne fountain....be sure to check it out, the setup alone is pretty cool! Gym was not bad-had what you needed. If you want to parasail, juet ski, etc-Bargain with them! Only negative thing-when you are sleeping-you hear everything because of the tile floor. If you are a light sleeper request a top floor, corner room! It is very musty in the rooms, it is the tropics but each of us developed allergy symptoms.

However, we got bumped off of two flights and missed the flight to Puerta Vallarta. We had booked through Perx. com and contacted them immediately. We were able to get to Cancun and asked about alternative accommodations. In less than 40 minutes, Perx changed our reservations and travel vouchers to the Riu Palace in Rivera Maya. We had no documents upon arrival in Cancun but our shuttle to the hotel knew about this and took care of us. When arriving at Cancun, once you clear customs, by-pass all of the time share people and exit out the right door to the shuttle and taxi people. The Riu Palace is approximately 1 hour south of Cancun in a completely gated complex. Check in was a snap. The hotel is \"u\" shaped so there is not really any ocean views. If going see if you can request a second floor room. The balconies are much larger and nicer facing the courtyard. The staff is unbelievable at this resort. They could not provide any better service. The service was equivalent to the Four Seasons...unbelievable. We had reservations at the restaurants but passed since the buffet was so outstanding in quality, food selection, and theme night selections. Swim up bar was excellent. However, there are a lot of families at this resort. If you want a quieter, relaxing time by the pool choose the Riu Palace Mexico...which is right down the block. A lot of bingo and other activities in the afternoon reminded me of a cruise ship...I like to sample the beverages and relax and not be hounded to play olympics in the sand. If you want to snorkel, para sail, or jet ski, walk the beach for the best price. You can negotiate price on these activities. For booking excursions, see Omar Rosario in the green pants in the lobby. He will fit the activity you are looking to do into your budget and give you some inside information regarding each excursion...which are newer, cleaner facility, etc. We did the Aktun-Chen at 80.00 per person. This included zip line, tour of the caves and snorkeling in an underground Cenote. It included a delicious lunch, transportation and was an all day activity. The groups were small and the focus was on safety and all the equipment was sanitized prior to our use (all had plastic coverings on them). Bring plenty of singles as you will want to tip many, many times. Another excursion is 5th Avenue which is about 20 minutes from the hotel.

Swim up pools are great but sometimes people drop straws or their drinks or food in the pool and I kind of found it to be a little gross. ALSO, STAY AWAY FROM ANYONE WHO APPROACHES YOU AT THE AIRPORT WANTING TO GIVE YOU GREAT DEALS ON EXCURSIONS. THIS IS A TRAP TO GET YOU TO BUY INTO TIMESHARES. I DIDN'T KNOW A HEAD OF TIME AND WAS LURED INTO THEIR NICENESS AND WILLINGNESS TO WANT TO SHOW YOU THE \"REAL\" MEXICO. They ask how old you are and if you're older than 30 they give you all these great deals and prices and say all you have to do is pick up the tickets at the mayan palace in playa del carmen. They give you a voucher for a free taxi ride to bring you to their hotel and once you get there you would get a free breakfast and a tour of the hotel. This is so that next time you go visit mexico you will stay at one of their mexican resorts instead of the Riu, which are not owned by mexico. And they feed you this story how they want to keep the money in mexico to help their country blah blah blah. Coming off a plane and being blindsided by these people it all sounded good. Paid out $40 to go see Tulum and set the date to meet at their hotel the next morning. I was a little uneasy about the whole thing but just wanted to get to the hotel and then as I started to think more and more about it,, I found it weird that we had to bring a credit card and our passports with us when we went to have the breakfast, and I also didn't like the fact that we were not to tell the hotel nor hotelbeds what we were doing. When I got to the RIU I spoke with a representative from hotelbeds who was our airport service and he told us it was a scam and he's seen it happen before to people and then I did some further research and found some horrible stories of peoples encounter with these scammers and how they actually went and felt like prisoners because the people at the mayan hotel would not let them leave.

Obviously I love this place or I wouldn't be talking about my 10th trip. But let me discuss a few things others may not mention. 1) Lots of coconut trees = lots of shade on the beach & around the pool. I always get a good tan when I go to Mexico, but after 2-3 hours in the sun each day I want shade and you'll have no trouble finding it at RPRM. 2) A great walk into town each morning along the beach (I walk about 3 miles each morning; it takes about an hour). You can wander off the beach and peak in the houses that are for rent. 3) Full access to all the other Riu Resorts. Every day I'd go for a walk after lunch and spend an hour or two at the pool of another resort. 4) Great bar service on the beach. You don't get this at most hotels (even the other Rius). 5) Live piano music from 6-8 pm at the lobby bar, live music & dancing on the patio each evening. 6) Beautiful grounds every where (not just at the hotel). If your soul isn't singing from the beauty that's in Playa, you're not really trying to have a good time! 7) Safety. I have never felt threatened in Playa.

From the moment our coach dropped us off we knew our holiday would be pure luxury. Marble and huge chandeliers in the reception hall/lobby, very classy and upmarket. No expense spared here. Rooms:- Our room was on the 2nd floor midway along. The room was a standard double suite and was more than adequate for a couple. The room was very clean with marble flooring. The room balcony wasn't as big as some neighbouring rooms but we hardley went out there. it overlooked the gardens and was quiet. The bathroom is lovely with a good hairdryer provided. The whirlpool bath is definately worth a go. Food/ Restaurants:- The main buffet is fantastic and we would have been more than happy to have eaten every meal here everyday. A huge choice of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner with champagne served if you wish. I would suggest you go here at lunch time and not to the steak house one as that one is packed and the food isn't as good (usually empty trays due to the amount of people using it) The buffet is themed every night and is well worth having the main dish from the cooking station. The chef's are brilliant and will serve you whatever you want. One even helped me make my own taco. The restaurants are lovely our favourite was Crystal which is modern al a carte food. I had Sea Bass which was perfect and the steak my husband had was lovely and tender. The Japanese restaurant was also good. Was not too impressed with the steak house or the Italian really much better food in the buffet. Room service is fantastic too with a lovely porter who brought a flower with the tray of food,. Fantastically presented. Drinks:- The champagne is really nice and is included in all inclusive package. The swim up bar is also good but busy. Staff:- couldn't have met nicer people. The waiters who serve you drinks on the beach/pool are fab and remember your order from previous rounds. The Americans tip heavily so you do feel that they might serve them a little better but cannot complain, we always had a drink. Beach/pool:- both extremely clean. The pool at the end of the day was warmer than bath water. The beach is cleaned every day and is spotless. the sun loungers are always free on the beach but you have to get up earlyish to get a good pool spot but we spent all holiday on the beach. Bit of a tip...we went topless and got a few rude remarks from american people even though the women tend to wear thong bikinis. I felt a little uncomfortable by this and put my bikini top on. The resort is safe and friendly you can walk around any time of day and not feel threatened at all. Mexican people are the friendliest people i have ever met and it is not about the money. Best holiday i have ever had.

We especially liked Krystal. The only problem we had was, just like many people warned us, \"musty smell\" and \"dampness\" in the air and even on the beds. We did not get good night sleep because of this. I am not sure why it was so damp, not only the beds but the sofa as well. However, the room was very clean all the time. This did help us feel better. We had excellent tours including two visits to Mayan ruins and a snorkeling tour. I highly recommend \"Mayan Adventure Snorkeling Tour\". You get to swim three kinds of water, in the lagoon, in the fresh water in Cenote, and in the limestone cave. This tour only takes a small group of people with a guide. You will see many varieties of fish in three different waters. We booked this tour at the hotel through \"Olympus\". Isabel was very very patient and helpful to find a suitable tour for our family.

Great drinks and easy to find someone to serve you at many of the bars located around the property, the bartenders were even patient when we couldn\u2019t decide what we wanted with so many options to choose from. Food was average most nights, but Sunday we got lobster and it was delicious! Bad: We wanted to eat in one of the reservations only restaurants but you can only make reservations at the hotel from noon-2, and reservations can only be made in person, this is ridiculous!!! Who is at the hotel all day?? We were out exploring!! So the last night we asked them for suggestions in town as we didn\u2019t want buffet again, and the lady at the front desk gave us attitude when we asked her for a recommendation.

Children have their own programs and even a time each evening to perform and have fun. The main Plaza has a beautiful fountain with cafe seating all around.

The staff works very hard to make you feel like you're #1. At the pool and in the courtyard (at night, watching the shows) drink service is non stop. We had a few issues in the lobby bar, where the servers didn't come up to us and we walked up to the bar. The bar tender did NOT like that. At first I thought he was annoyed with us, because he would take the order but tell us to sit, and someone would bring it out. BUT I think he was annoyed with the server for making us get up! Anyway, overall, service was great. Loved the food, thought everything was magnificent. Don Manolo's is far from the pool, so many people opt for Chilis for lunch, since it is closer. We found that the food at Don Monolo's was better than Chili's. Buffet for breakfast and lunch had so much variety we had no problem eating there for 6 days. We read bad reviews about the steakhouse (Chilis) so we did not go there for dinner. We did go to all other restaurants, which were all excellent. Agave (the Mexican) was especially good, as was Krystal (french fusion). The only annoyance was the fact that you had to stand in line to make the reservations, and there are only 2 seatings per night, so you're eating at 6:30 or 8:45, quite a spread between. You can make 2 nights of reservations at a time, so at least you didn't have to stand in line every day. We never saw a cockroach or bug in the room. Our room was kept clean and the mini bar and shampoos in the bathroom always restocked. The only complaint I have for the room is that there are people in and out constantly. They have so many different people: the maids, people to restock the bar, people to clean the bathroom and restock towels and shampoos, etc. I guess it's necessary to have different people for the jobs, but it felt like every time we came back to our room, someone was in there. On that note, we didn't have anything stolen, which I had seen in reviews happened while using the safe. We kept one of the pockets on our luggage locked up at all times with our money and passports, etc, and no one bothered anything. However, I don't know if it was through the vents or just the walls, but we could hear our upstairs neighbors all the time! Not the best insulation... it may have been the terrible beds that also prevented us from sleeping. It think at one point they were firm matresses, but now they're so worm they are extremely bouncy and overall, uncomfortable. There were a lot of kids, and they always seemed to be doing cannonballs by the pool bar. It seemed like parents weren't watching a lot of the time, and I wouldn't blame the hotel for that. However, there were no programs or anything to keep kids occupied or in certain areas. Just something to keep in mind if you don't have kids. We went swimming around 12 each night, hotel staff walked by, said hello, and basically told you to have fun, they didn't care we were swimming even though the pool was technically closed. Grounds and pool are immaculate, towels that they rented out (using the cards they give you at check in) are good enough. Also, ride from the airport was about 40 minutes with a private transfer. All in all, we loved it, but I wanted to be particular so that you know what to expect.

We loved the Playacar area so much we went back to the Riu Palace Riveira Maya in April 2011 for 2 weeks and we visited the other Rius including the Riu Yucatan again. This review compares the 2 hotels. Firstly cost. We paid 50% more for the Palace stay so as you would expect the Palace was better than the Yucatan in most ways. The question is was it worth the extra money? I think so but my friend disagreed and would have preferred the extra \u00a3550 to spend on something else. We enjoyed both holidays and will go back to Playacar again. Hotel ambience The Palace was much more refined on the whole, with people being less noisy. One evening at the Palace someone yelled out and everyone turned to look at them to see who was making a noise! The pace of the holiday was more relaxing at the Palace for me and I liked it but it was deemed a bit boring for my friend as there were fewer daytime and evening activities than we had had at the Yucatan. The Palace had more Americans than Europeans and the Yucatan had more Brits/Europeans than Americans. The Yucatan was livelier in many ways and had more of a party atmosphere. Outside Areas Both hotels were well laid out. The Palace had better air conditioning in the reception and restaurant/buffet areas. The Palace gardens were very formal whilst the Yucatan gardens had lots of trees which supported a range of wildlife including monkeys which came to visit you on your balcony looking for food. I hardly saw a mosquito at the Palace but had a hard time avoiding them at the Yucatan. Not sure if this was the time of year or because the hotel was in more natural surroundings. Rooms We stayed via Thomson and in both hotels this meant we got rooms facing away from the sea/pools/gardens but our views weren\u2019t that bad. Rooms in both hotels were surprisingly similar (I expected more from the Palace). Both had optic bottles of spirits on the wall, a fridge with soft drinks, beer, a safe, iron. The palace also had a coffee maker. The Palace room was bigger with a step down to a sitting area with a sofa and table and this was where the TV was located \u2013 not much good when you wanted to watch TV in bed. The TV wasn\u2019t any bigger or better than the one at the Yucatan. The Palace had a Jacuzzi bath and shower but it was in the same room as the washbasins and toilet. It was also very chunky in design and difficult to step in and out of. I slipped one evening and got a massive bruise on my inner thigh as a result. The Yucatan had the toilet separate to the washbasins and only had a shower but it was easier to share than the Palace. The Yucatan had the TV facing the bed. So overall we preferred the room at the Yucatan. Food & Drink Yucatan buffet was good with a good range of tasty food for breakfast, lunch and dinner but the Palace was superb \u2013 there was the same huge range but everything was better quality. There was champagne for breakfast, a chocolate fountain most evenings and every evening and most lunch-times the most tender beef steaks I have ever had on holiday (tried the steak at the Riu Palace Mexico and it was much tougher). Strangely, I put on less weight at the Palace RM. I put this down to the fact that everything you chose was lovely to eat so I just had one plateful and that was enough. At the Yucatan I didn\u2019t always like everything on my plate so went back for more so probably ate more overall. My rule at the Palace of \u2018one plate and one layer of food\u2019 appeared to work well. The only fault I can think of with the buffet was that they never made waffles for breakfast but I am sure the Yucatan did. Also, although men could wear smart shorts to the buffet in the evening the shorts were expected to cover their knees. Smart shorts cut above the knee were not considered formal enough. The Palace does a waiter service around the pool and beach which was luxurious. The speciality restaurants at both hotels were good and both required men to wear long pants. Activities Both hotels had excellent animation staff and did water aerobics, water volleyball, bingo, evening shows. The Palace did fewer games and virtually no prizes just certificates and Riu neck scarves every night!! I was gutted. At the Yucatan I won a massage, hats, bum bags, T-shirts and bottles of rum at bingo etc. I was really disappointed with the Palace whose highlight was a games evening and a casino style evening where you tried to win chips and exchange them for fairly trivial prizes. The Palace had a lunchtime fashion show round the pool selling bikinis and sarongs which I bought one of. Pools Both had 2 pools and a swim-up bar, the Yucatan had 2 swim-up bars. The Palace had an infinity pool and a large pool for activities and with Jacuzzi areas and the swim-up bar. The water was usually clean altho\u2019 by the end of the day there was some signs of suncream oil scum by one set of steps. The Yucatan pool was just as large and one of the swim-up bars was separate from the main pool. The main pool didn\u2019t feel very clean and the separate swim-up bar was so murky I wouldn\u2019t go in it. The Palace pools were far better. Both hotels had plenty of sunbeds round the pools but it seemed easier to find one at the Palace then at the Yucatan. Sea/beach At both hotels there were lots of sunbeds on the beach. More shade available at the Palace. Beach and sea similar as you would expect as they are not far from each other. So in conclusion we will definately go back - we may try the Riu Playacar next time.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA mixed Bag....\u201d", "Author": "skibunnee007", "ReviewID": "UR116399395", "Content": "General: Overall we had a blast! The only real \"disappointment\" was the quality of room. As mentioned below, the room was adequate, but if room is a driving decision factor in resort, there are likely better options for the money. Everything else met or exceeded expectations. Overall, the staff was very friendly and happy to please. The shows were fun and entertaining, albeit cheesy. The mariachi show was actually something that we would have paid money to see. The resort was fairly quiet at night. We visited La Pinata one night at the Riu Tequilla hoping to shake it a bit. However, no one was in the club. So it's a great place for couples and families. Partiers would likely be happier in Cancun. Room: We had a junior suite on the top level, lobby side of the hotel. Luckily we had no experiences with cockroaches, perhaps due to the upper level room. The room at times felt a bit like a cave due to its lack of lighting and narrow width. There was always a strange smell present which could have been simply the result of the humidity or roach pesticide. Not sure which. The bathroom lacked a fan. The bathtub was very dark since it did not have a light in the shower/tub. The safe was down low to the ground making it difficult to access things, but fortunately nothing was stolen as mentioned in other reviews. Our room did not have a true balcony. There was a small surface on which we could step out. Many of the rooms that were not on the lobby side of the resort had fuller balconies. None of these were major concerns. But together they made the room average and made us wonder if it would have been a better option to save some money and get a room at a less expensive resort. Pool: The pool had a very nice swim up bar. It was not overly crowded and there was never an issue getting a couple lounge chairs. Since other reviews mentioned problems with this. Perhaps we had luck because it was off season. Drinks: The drinks were decent. We asked for brand name liquor instead of the standard well licquor and the bartenders happily obliged. Drinks were not overly strong, but we got the impression from the friendly staff that if you were to ask the bartenders for more alcohol, they would gladly oblige. Gym: The gym was pretty comparable to other all-inclusive gyms. It was good enough to get a basic work out. But not much more than that. There were two treadmills, three eliptical machines, a bicycle, a stepper, and a rower. There were also about eight weight machines, some benches, and a stack of dumbells. We had access to the gyms at the other Riu properties, all of which were within a twelve minute walk away. However, we only used the Palace Riviera facility because we never had any issues getting on any of the machines. This could have been because we were not there during peak season. Beach: The beach was the highlight of the property. The water was a beautiful blue and very warm to swim in. There was no real need for sandals or water shoes. There is an extensive palm tree grove on the part of the beach closest to the resort for those who desire shade. The area also had hammocks. There was free use of body boards, kayaks, and sail boats. It was very quiet most of the time which was nice as we liked to read. The beach was spacious enough that it never felt like people were on top of each other. Food: The buffet had many different options every day from which to choose. The food was very good for buffet style. The restaraunts were on par or slightly better than the buffet food. Given that the you had to lock in times with reservations for the restaurants (made between 12 and 3 in main lobby bar), toward the end of our stay, we opted for the buffet which gave us more flexibility while on vacation. One noticeable thing about the wait staff is they were a little over zealous to take away plates before we were completely finished. It was more funny than an annoyance. But it could bother some people. We visited the other Rius and walked through their buffets. We didn't actually sample any of the food, but we felt that the quality of the food at the RPM seemed to be superior to the other Rius. So if food is a large factor in resort choice, the RPM would be a better choice. Location: Terrific location. The resort and the sister Riu properties are located in the gated section of Playa Del Carmen known as Playacar. It is a seven dollar taxi ride, or a twenty minute walk via sidewalk or beach into the main part of Playa del Carmen. There are many shops and restaurants in town. Also, many of the items such as suntan lotion are much less expensive than at the resort. We never felt unsafe in Playacar or in the downtown section. Excursions: We caught the ferry to Cozumel from downtown Playa del Carmen $30 round trip for 2 people. In Cozumel, we rented a car through Executive car rental for about $60 and drove around the island. There are Mayan ruins and miles of spectacular coastline and beaches to frolic in. We stopped at Coconuts Bar and Grill. It's a waterfront restaurant and they serve Mexican food, but it was nothing spectacular. The margaritas were powerful and delicious! We also did the tour to Chichen-Itza. We purchased the tour through the hotel. While we are typically not tour people, we did so because we were a little concerned about safety while travelling in Mexico. It made for a very long day, though the ruins were a must see for us. They also stopped at a Cenote for a swim on the tour.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whittier, CA", "Title": "\u201cBest vacation ever\u201d", "Author": "evadlt", "ReviewID": "UR116362755", "Content": "This was my husband and I 6 stay at one on the Riu Hotel's, and our first stay at Palace Maya. My husband and I called 3 days before we arrived to make sure they had our reservation and room ready. Upon arrival they had reserved a beautiful Garden View room for us, and when we got to our room it was already occupied. We went back down to the lobby and spoke to the manager and they had no other Garden View rooms available, they apologized and told us that they would have 5 suites available the next day and we could pick out which one we wanted, and we were very happy. We got a free upgrade to a suite and our room had ocean view, wrapped around balcony and view to the main pool. We were also welcomed with Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room. It was amazing. The hotel is very beautiful, clean and if you stay at this hotel you can go to the other Riu's and use there amenities too. We love the main buffet and 5 different restaurant's on the propoerty. Yes, they have a dress code and they enforce it. My husband and I like that they have this policy because if they didnt people would walk dressed inappropiate. If you dont like it, just go down to the main buffet and eat there, you wont be disappoint with the food. Also, make sure you get there on time. One night we ate at the Steak house and one table that had reservations for 15 people arrived 40 minutes late and still got seated. The problem here is that every course is timed and the people who got there late disrupted the timed courses. They waiters had to catch up, seving the table of 15 people trying to catch up and they never did. This made the waiters give bad service to us and all the people who got there on time for dinner. Everyone was very upset and I complained to manager. I made it very clear that they should have never allow the people to walk in 40 minutes late and should have never been seated. They should have told them to come back tomorrow or another night. Be on time and have consideration for others. Over all the food at all the 5 restaurant's is 5 stars. The beach is beautiful and the water is warm. There are no vendors on the beach, so I did miss buying doughnuts, jewerly, mexican ice cream's and all the rest. The reason why they dont allow it, is because they dont want the beach to become vendor infested and I understand. The pool is big, but too crowded and noisey. We didnt spend anytime at the pool and didnt care since we preferred the beach anyways. We went down to downtown Playa del Carmen for shopping, most people were walking, but I dont recommend it. Take a taxi instead and save your walking for downtown, because the street goes on for miles. It took my husband and I 3 to 4 hours to walk the whole strip. We went down to Playa Mammita beach, which is amazing, that is where all the locals hang out. We also went to Akumal beach to swim with the turtles and the most famous cenote Christalino Cenote, highly recommend it. There is also 5th Avenue shopping center which is 10 minute walk from the hotel. It was too hot to walk, we should have taken a taxi too, but we didnt, big mistake. The outside plaza entertainment was great. Everyday they had a different band, a jazz musician and other entertainers. The servers were are wonderful. Make sure you take money to tip these wonderful people. They get paided very little money and work 12 hour's per day they rely on tips to be able to feed there families. My husband and I always tip and we receive great service and they take very good care of us. That is why we continue to come back to the Riu's we get spoiled with all the first class service we get.

But, they gave us a junior suite which has a full ocean view. We are on different floor (7/8) but it's easy to go to each others room because we're very near the stairs. Better ask for an upgrade but do not forget to tip the guys at the check-in, it works. Food is great. Seafood is what we all want and they served that many times on the 7 days that we were there. They have different themes during lunch/dinner. The shows are great and the people are great. Kids are safe to roam around. Alcohol is very good. We always drink tequila and they only serve us patron during our stay. We went outside for 2 days, one is snorkeling on an island and the other one is trip in the town (for free). We use a different site to book and they have a rep at the lobby who helped us book the side trips. He's a nice guy but I don't think Im allowed to mention the site here.

I have another review on another resort in our trip this year in Cancun. This is our 2nd time using RIU and I thought it's time to use another resort. I would say my next trip in the Bahamas I will book RIU again.

I'd read some reviews that weren't that glowing and knowing some one who had stayed at the Palace I decided to pay a bit extra and changed to that hotel. In my opinion it was well worth the extra money and was totally in a different class to the Playacar. The service we got from all the staff, either in the dining areas or bar areas was exceptional, best service we've had in any hotel. The staff were really friendly and attentive without being in your face. Breakfast, lunch and dinner was great, with lots of variety to please even the most picky of people. In the two weeks both my wife and i put on over half a stone! Rooms were very clean and spacious, fresh towels everyday and the mini bar was always well stocked. The evening shows were good enough to keep you entertained whilst you digested your three or four course dinner. The whole resort is very safe to go out walking in the evening, we walked to the 5th Avenue shopping area and felt totally safe. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will probably return there sometime soon. There are a couple of things that people should be aware of. Firstly we were not aware that you have to pay an exit tax when flying back, this has to be paid in cash. For the four of us it cost \u00a3160.

I cannot believe some of the complaints that some have managed to come up with about this hotel. I actually met Trip Advisor member Wullie from Mauchline and agree completely with his assessment and review of the hotel. Our whole experience was first class and we would definitely return in the future to this hotel. We had emailed the hotel before we travelled and asked if it would be possible to reserve a courtyard room, as it was our tenth wedding anniversary. We didn't actually expect the request to be met, as I'm sure they get requests for special rooms on a daily basis. However, on our arrival at the hotel, we were met by the Duty Manager, who had arranged for our request to be met. Later that evening we had a special delivery of chocolate strawberries and champagne delivered to our room, courtesy of the hotel. Him and his staff could not have been any more helpful that day and throughout the rest of our stay, which is in stark contrast to what some of the reviews have said about the front desk. Perhaps common courtesy and manners to staff results in getting the same returned! The hotel sits on a beautiful stretch of beach, shared by about 8 or 9 other hotels. Our hotel is probably the best of all of these, especially of the Riu's. Our friends were staying at the Riu Yucatan at the same time as we were in the Palace and we both visited each others hotels. They were completely disappointed with the Yucatan, especially with the food and air conditioning in public areas, whilst they thought our hotel was fantastic. For the person from Texas to complain about the Lobby in the Palace, completely flabbergasts me! I have never seen a grander Lobby and cannot believe that someone could actually complain about it. In fact, the whole hotel looked lovely, from the pool areas to the avenues and restaurant decor. The rooms could perhaps have been a bit bigger and lighter, but we didn't spend a lot of time there and overall were pleased with the room. The air conditioning was first class, and although there was a musty smell in the room at times, you have to realise that this is the Caribbean, Mexico in particular, and that the humidity is brutal. The service throughout the hotel was brilliant especially barman Islas on the Lobby bar, waiting staff Isa at the Lobby, Paty, Alex and Alonso at the Pool, Ernesto and Damian in the Buffet, Tilo and Luis Miguel in Chilis, Kevin in Krystals and Chato in the outside bar area in the evenings. A special thank you to Pedro, who worked predominantly in the Lobby and Theatre as the Captain. Excellent manners, service and attitude to everyone he met. Apologies to anyone we've forgotten, as the service and courtesy from all staff was magnificent. Overall, the holiday was fantastic and for some people to give one or two stars for this hotel is astonishing. This is our seventh time in Mexico and I'd like to think that we know a few things about the country and people by now. We can honestly say that if you book to stay at this hotel , you will not be disappointed. All you need is a holiday head, a manner that involves treat as you want to be treated yourself and a respect for the staff that are working in tempratures that the rest of us find uncomfortable sitting in swimming gear with a drink in our hands, being waited on!

I have been there before and also the Riu Mexican Palace down the street. I will not be going back. It seems as though it is for the masses now, as though it gets its food from Sam's Club in bulk down the street and serves it up for a buffet (and some of the restaurants!) The lobby and the outside areas are beautiful. The beach is great. The staff is attentive. There were a million kids, crying babies, exhausted looking parents all over the place making plenty of noise (four kids in the room next to us with their double stroller blocking our entry and they just threw out a dirty diaper into the hallway instead of keeping it in their room!), kids running around the awful buffet bumping into people (I do like kids, but I really like when parents keep them under control!) The bedding in the rooms is disgusting. It smells, it's very old and dated and stained (every kind of stain you can imagine!) I put down a beach towel I brought from home on top of my sheet so I wouldn't have to touch them too much. I don't know if it's an American thing, but I want a pretty, fluffy bed to get into at the end of a day in the sun and I expect that. Instead I was awake most of the night wondering about my bedding history. Creepy! The drapery smelled moldy and sitting on the love seat in the room was out of the question. The pool was hot, and as far as bacteria, that's not good. Didn't go in it at all. Think Seinfeld, bacteria frappe -- Dirty diapers, warm pool water...... The pool bar is located in a bad spot in this hotel. it is very close to the beach. If you like quiet on the beach, the loud music is annoying. The staff get on the microphone and start to shout about bingo and games, bantering back and forth with the guests. I think that's expected if you sit at the pool, but not the beach. The Riu Palace Mexico down the street has their pool bar for bingo and games located further away from the beach so you don't have to hear all of that. And they have a separate beach bar. The Riu Palace Mexico is laid out much better. The entertainment was something to walk past at night after a bad dinner as you finish downing some shots to give you the courage to face the bed again. Sorry, I know this was a lot of negativity, but if these things are important to you, don't go to this hotel. If you have the ability to flop down on any kind of bed after a busy day, eat just about anything, then you will probably be okay here. If you care even a little bit about your bedding, civilized dining in a buffet, you should stay elsewhere. Maybe it's me.

Once you get there, you have to immediately go to an area where you book your formal dinners for your stay. When we got to the hotel, our rooms were not ready for 3 hours because they were running late, so we went to go make our reservations right away. The dinner reservation worker said that all of the good restaurants had already been booked full through our stay, so we were stuck with the buffet and a few nights of actual eating out. When they advertised their restaurants for this hotel, i would have thought they would have been accessible. We had upgraded to a suite, but I'm not sure that our room was really upgraded at all. It was down a damp hallway that was always being freshly painted, so you couldn't touch the walls and it smelt strongly of chemicals. Our \"jacuzzi\" tub that was advertised was actually just a normal bath tub, and our bed sheets were very damp. The whole room was just muggy and not comfortable. We asked to be switched to a different room, but the staff said the hotel was completely full and they did nothing to find us another room or check back in with us during our stay at all. The outdoor pool was cold, so it was not enjoyable to be in unless it was very very hot out. The buffet food was mass-produced, and low quality, and the drinks were more sugar than anything else. The \"free internet' that was promised cannot be accessed from the hotel rooms- you must sit in a specific spot in the lobby to try to catch it. The beach was dirty with cigarette butts, and when we went to use the spa, one of the workers there stole my camera with my trip photos on it! I went to speak with the hotel manager about all of this, and he was reluctant to speak to me at all. When he finally would see me he was rude and not sympathetic. I have read some other reviews confirming that this manager is just awful. I e-mailed their customer service when I got home and I never even received a response. We are not the types to go looking for bad things in hotels, and we were very excited for this trip so the RIU Palace Riviera Maya was a huge disappointment. I'm sure some people would have a different experience here, but you better hope for very hot weather so that you can swim, and hopefully you won't have to deal with any of their grumpy staff members and you will manage to get dinner reservations with some of their nice restaurants there.

Unfortunately the price was a step up but the value was spotty compared to the Rui Vallarta. Here are my pro's and con's for those of you looking to stay at Rui but not sure between these two just to keep things simple(discarded Riu Jalisco). Pros: 1. Lobby was a definite upgrade in luxury and with air conditioning. Seems like most of the upgrade is invested to the lobby. 2.Beach area is very nice and slightly better than Riu Vallarta, clean sand's 3.Pool is clean and feels bigger than Riu Vallarta 4.Lobby bar is exceptionally nice, its a HUGE upgrade to the Riu Vallarta. 5.Nicer Restaurant selection. Cons: 1Restaurant reservation system is VERY difficult (near impossible) to work with since the first day you get there is almost guaranteed to be booked so you don't have a option. Then you have to struggle with limited time selections, booking time rules and restaurant options. Unless you stay here for over a week you won't get a return on investment with this system. 2. Buffet is a slight downgrade from Rui Vallarta...this is quite serious flaw since the buffet is a central peice of the system I was expecting it to be a clear noticeable upgrade in selection and quality. The food quality is a wash but the variety is less than Rui Vallarta. All 3 of us got sick (not sure if it was the food or lots of drinking) but I can't say if it was specifically the buffet food. 3. There are no bathroom's visibly close to the pool area... youd think they have at least one close just to promote pool cleanliness. 4.

This was the second time in three years that we've stayed at this resort. We stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico last year and they are both very similar. Each has their own pros and cons, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend either one. Here are some highlights, and a couple lowlights, of our stay. Airport Transfers: GREAT!!! We use Cancun Transfers for private transportation to and from the airport. The company representative was standing outside the terminal with our name on a board. We were quickly loaded and on our way. The ride only took about 45 minutes. The new road through Playa del Carmen really helps a lot. We were given ice cold beers, water, and Coke for the ride. Irma and Milton were our drivers and there were great. If you\u2019re interested in a quick, non-stop, safe, and friendly ride to and from your resort, then Cancun Transfers are what you\u2019re looking for. Check-in: Quick and friendly service. Since we were repeat guests we knew about the resort and we didn't need the extended explanation of how things work. We were in our room within 10 minutes of arriving at the resort. Room: The rooms at the Riu are perfectly fine. We requested a King bed on an upper floor and that\u2019s just what we received. The mini-bar was stocked with beer, water, and soda. There is also rum, vodka, brandy, and tequila available in your room, as well as a coffee maker. Since we don\u2019t spend a lot of time in the room we do not require anything more. Everything worked. The A/C was fine. The bathroom was good size. I really don\u2019t know what else anyone would want. Housekeeping was good. Food/Restaurants: The food was good, as always. The buffet for dinner was our least favorite. It was international night the only time we ate dinner at the buffet and it was just OK. International night is code word for \u201cItalian\u201d night. It was fine, but I didn\u2019t go to Mexico to eat pasta and pizza. All of the al-a-carte restaurants were very good. Krystal was by far the best, followed by the steakhouse, the Mexican restaurant, and the Japanese restaurant. We did not eat at the Brazilian this time. Breakfast and lunch were very good. Breakfast and lunch are served buffet style so you can get whatever you\u2019re in the mood for. The service at all of the restaurants was great. Anything you need, they were happy to accommodate. We stayed for 5 nights and were able to get a reservation for 4 nights. I don\u2019t understand why people can\u2019t get reservations. This was our fourth stay and a Riu property and I\u2019ve NEVER had an issue with restaurant reservations. Shows: Are they great? No. Are they funny? Sometimes. Are they entertaining? Sure. The entertainment staff does a great job and really tries their best. If you want to see breathtaking shows go to Coco Bongo. There is a disco at the Riu Tequila if you are interested in something a little more active. For us, the shows were a good way to end a long and hot day. Drinks: I just don\u2019t get why people complain about some drinks not having enough alcohol in them, order a double or tell the bartender that you want it STRONG! They will, just ask. They were fine to me. The beer was Dos Equis, bottles in your room and on tap everywhere else. You want top shelf liquor? Just ask. Don Juilo is a great, and expensive, tequila and the bartenders will gladly get it for you if you ask. Beach/Pool Service: It is available, but sometimes it can be a little wait. If you expect beach and pool service to be at you beckon call anytime you want then you will be disappointed. If you are willing to wait 10 minutes for someone to walk by and take your order then you\u2019ll be much happier. Never had a problem with this and the hotel was at 100% capacity for 2 of our 5 night stay. Bars and Bartenders: This is where I think both Riu Palace\u2019s shine. The bartenders get to know you and will take care of you. Marvin, Tom, and Lesther always were on the lookout for me to walk by and were always smiling and happy to serve. I just wish they had more time to talk to the guests. I would have loved to talk more to them, but they were way too busy. Please tip the workers. They work from 9am-2am six days a week and for very little pay. They work hard and deserve to be rewarded for their service. The only problem we had our entire stay was that the beach was not cleaned of seaweed during the morning. The other resorts in the area did and their beach looked much nicer. Last time we stayed, the workers were cleaning the beach by sunrise every day. This time, I only saw them attempt to do so once. It would have been much better if the seaweed was taken care of daily. The only thing that truely disappointed me was the behavior of some of the guests. The workers are not your servants. They are not your personal butlers. If you need something they will help you out. But please keep requests reasonable. A beach server is there to take drink orders, not to go get you \u201cpieces of cut up pineapple with just a little salt.\u201d If you want something to eat, go get it. If you want something to drink, they will bring it to you\u2026as long as they\u2019re not busy getting food for other people. Also, please remember that the Riu Palace Riviera Maya is a family friendly resort. If you desire to sunbathe topless, that\u2019s your prerogative. Just keep in mind that children are staying at the resort and are often shocked to see what they\u2019re looking at. There are plenty of Adult Only resorts in the Mayan Riviera where you can let it all hang out. Finally, the beach is not your ashtray or your trashcan. I was truly shocked to see all of the trash left on the beach. One morning, I saw a worker that had a large trash bag completely full of plastic trash that people just left lay. Some of that trash gets blown into the sea and is very harmful to the sea life. Please be considerate, if not to the other guests, at least to the innocent sea life that you\u2019re damaging. Pick your trash up and throw it away. Overall, we had a very nice stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. We loved the service and the food. We also enjoyed the pool and the bars. There is nothing more we could have asked for. Would we recommend this resort? Yes. Would we return? Probably. We may try somewhere else next year. We met a very nice family from Guadalajara and they recommended the west coast of Mexico, like Puerto Vallarta. Maybe we should try and visit the Dominican Republic also.

The joke decor of the lobby area should be your first clue AS WELL AS THE ROOM DECOR and the welcome drink hot watered down like all other drinks in this place. Juice right out of a box from Sam's Club in Playa non-alcoholic. Who welcomes you in Mexico without a Margarita or Cerveza? Room was nasty, roaches, no hot water, fridge leaked water in room always HAVING TO maintain that. Front Desk was the worst staff I have ever encountered and they get paid the most per the locals AND other staff members. All other staff was awesome. Marlene who we tipped every day for keeping our room and stocked with extra towels so we could keep up with the leaking fridge. Isles at the lobby bar who was a true native to Playa Del Carmen as he was born there, and was very friendly and everyone loved him. Marvin at the pool bar worked his butt off in the heat and always with a smile. The water was never hot in our room, FAN at one speed, AC could not keep up with local climate conditions, and the bedspread was removed promptly and stowed in closet as we shared with Marlene our house keeper not to put it back on the bed. Every time we tossed and turned at night due to the HOT room the plastic mattress cover made a squeaking noise that would wake a sleeping child.Oh the safe worked one plus for the room and the view to 2 points for that. Had a JR suite with a view which was nice. Had to go to Wal Mart $14 round-trip to purchase bleach, febreze to maintain the mildew, must, and smells that penetrated your nostrils, stomach on a daily basis. Also purchased BIG CUPS FOR OUR DRINKS AT POOL BECAUSE THEY ARE KID SIZE WITH EXTRA LONG 7 ELEVEN BIG GULP Straw's! ANOTHER WARNING WHEN ORDERING A TROPICAL DRINK LIKE A PINA COLODA BE WARNED NOW, NO COCO LOPEZ OR FRESH PINEAPPLE JUICE, IT IS A PREMIXED PRESERVITIVE BOUGHT CONCOUCTION THAT COMES OUT THE THE SODA FOUNTAIN LINE, JUST DOUBLE THE ALCOHOL SO IT KILLS THE TASTE NASTY AND GROSS! Another cheap BULK product( you pay for it though they keep costs low, what a joke) NO COKE PRODUCTS ONLY PEPSI, NO CORONA ONLY DOS EQUIS! Wine selection was HORRIBLE. WARNING wait staff doesn't know the difference between variety of white or red wines, just a tip so make sure you taste all wines before ordering, even though it is free takes time to get it right. FOOD WAS THE WORST EVER HAD. THE BEANS AT THE BUFFET WERE WATERED DOWN, AND RUNNY, ALL BREADS, DESSERTS AND PASTRIES ARE MADE WITH \"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER\" (MORE COST SAVING TATICS BY Riu Resorts) More processed food, and hydrogenated oils. All bland no flavor, and cold bread and cold margarine, I haven't had margarine since I was 7 years old. HELLO? TIP-we found flour tortilla's and hash browns, and guacamole for our daily feed at the buffet our version of breakfast taco's. FOOD AT ALL PROPERTY RESTAURANT'S WAS HORRIBLE. STEAK WAS FULL OF FAT AND GRISTLE, AND PAPER THIN AND BURNT. SHRIMP WAS THE SIZE OF A QUARTER AND OH IT WAS WARM NICE! THE SPA BURNED INSCENSE IN THE WAITING AREA NO LAVENDAR OR ESSENTIAL OIL OR RELAXING AMBIEANCE.

The staff were the most attentive and friendly without exception.(This may be due to the way we treated them and we never tipped until the end of our stay!) On day one, we were just going to sit down by the pool and before our bums were on the seat the drinks waiter was offering us any drinks that we wanted and this continued for the whole stay. The food in the restaurants was excellent, we were just as happy to use the main restaurant as the specialist. We did not find booking the restaurants an issue, we just strolled up any time between 12 and 3pm. If they were booked we would look in any of the restaurants at night and they would sometimes have free places, (due to people booking and then not turning up, not the hotels fault!). I reckon I had the best steak meal that I have ever had in the Fusion restaurant. The waiters in there were brilliant most attentive and friendly. The pool did get fairly noisy as the day went on but we just sat at the beach side of the pool looking out to sea and let the other people enjoy themselves. In the Lobby Bar after dinner, the staff again were brilliant. When we asked for Chivas Regal whisky, we thought we were pushing the boat out a bit and would incur an extra cost as it is a premium whisky,but no problem the barman brought the bottle to us and poured our drink in front of us. On our second night he saw us coming and had the drink poured as we reached the bar. Our room was kept spotless with fresh linen every day. We were with friends who were in adjacent room and as far as noise was concerned we very rarely heard a thing. Any time we had an issue with the room someone was there promptly to put it right.

All of our clothes smelled of mildew when we left. The hallways echoed and you could hear everything in the rooms around you. For the quality of this hotel it should have been much less expensive. The pool was large, but crowded, old, and dirty. It does have a nice beach and shade options, but we could get that at any other Playacar hotel.

Cons: 1) You are not guaranteed to get to eat in ANY of their restaurants your entire stay. We had to stand in a long line (between 12-3) to make dinner reservations - which most time when we got to the front are told that all restaurants are completely booked - which they are not. We showed up for dinner on the only night we could get a reserv. and the restaurant was over 1/2 empty. Same thing for the 4 other couples in our group. The draw for us to come to this hotel was what we thought were the many restaurant options and bars to hang out in, but they make that process difficult. Hope you like buffets, because that is where you will spend most of your meal time. 2) I'm normally a pool girl and like to look at the ocean from the pool and not deal with sand, but there were soooo many babies and children in the pool next to the swim up bar it drove us to the beach. It didn't appear to have a separate area for kids to hang at. 3) The \"entertainment\" was lacking. The Sports Bar was not what you would imagine and had florescent white lights and no pulse. I never thought I would spend the bulk of my time at a lobby bar, but they close early so you're choice is the Sports Bar or bar in the theater that has stage acts - we saw clowns and dancing kids on stage. 4) The rooms smelled like mildew, and the sheets felt damp. 5) BE AWARE - there are NO king sized beds...They have 2 full sized beds pushed together, and when we walked into the room and saw the bed we were not happy, so the bag handler offered to bring us a king sized mattress pad so there wasn't an obvious crease in the middle of our bed. The blankets on our bed were filthy and had what appeared to be blood or red wine on it. 6) There were no good views of the ocean from the room.

Restaurants are good, need to reserve early but we also got in (7 people) just by walking up and asking about cancellations -- no problem. Beach (A+) = Huge and beautiful. No issues getting lounge chairs and you are not on top of each other like other resort further South. As far as snorkeling nothing in front of RPRM but if you walk past the last resort going south (about 15 min walk from RPRM) there is a reef about 75 yards from the shore. Some fish that will keep you and the kids busy. Also, if you walk further down, maybe another 15 mins south from that point, nice little lagoons with more good snorkeling.

Since 'superior suite' faced the pool, I wanted to ensure it was not too noisy before paying any additional price. The day before we left, I re-confirmed my reservations and was told that superior rooms were still available. The reservation agent agreed I might as well wait until I arrived to see what these actually provided, as it was highly unlikely the hotel would fill up in less than 24 hours. I arrived willing to pay for the nicest rooms available. I requested upgraded rooms. I made it clear over and over that I was not looking for anything free, but wanted to pay for the nicest available. I was told there were no superior rooms available so I checked their web site on-line. When I pointed out that there were superior suites, I was told: 1. this was incorrect as they were not listed on the riu web site. (they were). 2. I could not obtain these rooms since I had already paid for the other rooms (I hadn't). I love this: 3. these rooms were actually rooms that weren't available because there were problems with them (no hot water, etc). But my favorite answer came from Omar, the manager, who came out and demanded (a bit loudly) did I think he was lying to me. (umm . . . yes?) Instead, I asked him what he would have done if I had booked and paid for these superior rooms prior to arrival. He responded . . . wait for it . . . here it comes. . . : 4. OVERBOOKING SUPERIOR ROOMS HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME AND GUESTS ARE GIVEN WHATEVER DOWNGRADED ROOMS ARE AVAILABLE. What was left to say? I went to inspect the rooms and when I discovered that the garden view included construction workers, I requested different jujnior suite rooms and was told: 5. I had requested connecting rooms and these were the only rooms that connected (they didn't). Angelika tried to argue with me about this, and asked the bell boy who confirmed my story that they do not connect. He had his head down, and I hope that telling the truth did not affect his job.

Our 2nd room, 2019, (presumably it still does not connect with room 2018), included a half-eaten candy bar in the servi-bar. The staff at the pool bar enjoyed their work, joining the laughter when the 20 something year old crowd danced around, bumping into others, and pulled down the bikini top of one (also laughing) girl.

The pool bar appeared to have a variety of alcohol choices and qualities. The Brazilian restaurant food was not bad. The waiters worked hard and provided very good service.

We got back a couple of weeks ago from our second trip to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. We were there last November and the second week of June for nine days. Check in: Very fast. We arrived around 1:00 pm and were checked in right away. We were taken to our room which was ready. I was a little disappointed with the view from theroom. The balcony was very small with the rooms on either side having large balconies with solid side walls so the view was very limited (you could only see straight ahead). I know this wouldn't matter to some, but I alwas upgrade our room so we have a view. Went to the front desk to see if we could change to another room. They told us to come back after lunch and we did. Still had nothing and told us to come back in the morning. At that point I didn't think we would be able to change but went back in the morning anyway. Spoke to the manager and we were changed to room 2057 with a very large balcony and a great view. Room: No musty smell in thisroom at all, the first room had a slight odor. Air and fan worked great. The room was extremely clean and was cleaned the same way the whole time we were there.The bed was an enormous king size which was very comfortable for us. I always bring extra hangers when I travel but didn't need them here (there were 20). On the second day, we came back from the pool to find a bottle of sparkling wine, a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a small sombrero with two shot glasses and note welcoming us back to the hotel. Very nice touch. We had to call a few times during our stay to have the drinks refilled, but it was no big deal to us. They would bring them within ten minutes and ten minutes after that the front desk would call to make sure it was done. Great customer service! Food: I know this is very subjective, but we thought the food was great! The first night we ate at the buffet. There is so much food to choose from, I can't believe someone couldn't find something they like to eat. Breakfast: Almost anything you could want for breakfast. Omlets made to order, fried or scrambled eggs, pancakes,french toast,quiche, yogurts, fruits delicious breads and pastries, fresh fruit juices, smoothies, cereals (hot and cold) &a large collection of cold cuts and cheeses. To the person who wrote in thier review \"If you wake up late, and was hungry beween 11-12 good luck finding food, that's when they change the buffet\". The 24 hour sports bar always has burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fresh fruit ad desserts. There is also 24 hour room service (very limited menu though) Try the cappuccino, it was very good. Also, have a mimosa or boody mary. You can make them yourself or the waiter wil make them for you. Lunch: There are two buffet, Chili's or Don Manolo. They have different items so if you don't like the casual food at Chili's you could go to Don Manolo and check out what they have there. Personally, I liked Chili's for lunch. Hot dogs, chili, burgers, chicken, pasta, pizza, salads, fruits and desserts. That was fine for us, we dont need or want a gourmet meal for lunch. Dinner: The buffet has many choices available. Always some type of chicken, beef, fish many salad selections, side dishes and of course great desserts (try the hard serve coconut ice cream (sooooo good). We ate at all the ala cartes except the Japanese. The Mexican was good, but if I'm being honest, it was better last time we were here. Service was great in all the restaurants. Next, we went to Chili's Steakhouse. We both had the ribeye steak (which was enormous)! My husband ordered his medium rare and mine was medium. Both were cooked perfectly. The baked Alaska for dessert was delicious. Next, was the Brazillian. I wasn't sure I would like this, but it was really good. Skip lunch on the day you book this. I don't remember how many meats they bring to the table (6 or 7). We stopped after the fifth lol. If I remember correctly there was sausage, pork, chicken, turkey, ribeye, filet mignon and maybe one more. All we had were very good and needless to say we had no dessert that night! Before our trip I had been in contact with Grecia Sanchez Public Relations) I had a few concerns that she helped me with. I mentioned to her that my birthday was June 10 and I would love to eat at Krystal on that day. She emailed me back saying we were confirmed for my birhday. So that day we ate at Krystal and it was great! We both had the filet mignon which were perfect. After dinner while we were waiting for our dessert three waiters came to the table sang to me and brought me a birthday cake. Vey nice surprise!! When we returned to our room afte dinner there was another bottle of sparkling wine, plate of chocolate covered strawberries, anothe small gift and a note wishing me a happy birthday. Bars: All as great as I remembered. Service was always fast and friendly. Not once did we have a bad bartender, but I have to mention our favorites. Claudia and Victor at the Sports Bar, Islas at the Lobby Bar, and Zorita (spelling) at the Pool Bar. They all are excellent! I also have to mention Tom, who ran around the pool getting people drinks and did a great job keeping my Bubba Keg filled! Pool: As others have said, the pool is very warm in the afternoons. I would say the water temperature had to be 90F or above. I don't know if anything could be done about that as the air temp was 90-95 everyday with high humidity. And yes some guests are very inconsiderate throwing straws and other debris into the pool. But all day I would see employees walking around with nets scooping things out of the pool. Alcohol: I don't know if all inclusives buy lower proof alcohol, but it is definitely not as strong as i is at home. That being said, I don't think it's a bad thing. I like to sip on my pina coladas or miami vices all day. I wouldn't be able to do that with strong drinks. We did see some drunk people at the pool, so apparently you could get a lot of alcohol if that's what you want. Just ask for more alcohol. The bartenders are more than happy to make your drinks as strong as you want them. Anamacion: Very hard working! At the pool they start at 10 AM. They have something to do every 15 minutes or so. Spanish lessons, riffle shooting, baci ball, horseshoes, beach and pool volleyball, bingo and some others. They try to get people involved, but if you don't want to they don't bother you. A few times during the week they also had a beach barbecue with a band, the entertainment team dancing with the guests and incredable food! If it rains (like it did two days we were there) they move some activities into the lobby. We are not show people, so I can't comment on them, but people we talked to there enjoyed them. Beach: Absolutely beautiful!! More than enough loungers in and out of the sun. There is now a slight drop before you get to the water (due to some erosion), but it was not a problem. The water was much nicer than when we were there in November, much warmer and very calm. Things that need improvement: It is very dark in the shower, a ceiling light is needed. The tv is bolted to the dresser facing the couch and doesn't have a swivel screen. You can barely see it from the bed (I need to watch tv to go to sleep). I know this can't be changed in the Riu's that are already built, but maybe in future hotels, seperate tub and shower. I think the shower would be very difficult to get in and out of for older people. I'm still giving this resort 5*. The minor things that I think could be improved would just add to what was a fantastic trip. In closing, I would like again to thank Grecia Sanchez for putting my mind at ease about the bug situation a few months ago (by the way, I didn't see one and believe me I LOOKED) and for arranging my wonderful birthday dinner. Also, Mark at Tripguy who assured me if I wasn't happy when we got there he would switch hotels for us. All my worries were put to rest as soon as Hector opened the door for us when we arrived. We've only been back a few weeks and are trying to figure out a way to go again in November for our anniversary. It is a beautiful resort with an amazing staff, you will not be sorry if you choose this one.

We highly recommend all of the restaurants. Everything was top notch. While not a complaint, the only advice I have is to ensure that you carefully choose the company you book any recreational activity with because they are NOT affiliated with the hotel. We had a company rep steal $100 from us because when converting the cost of each of our party's cost to enter Wet & Wild to see the dolphins, he charged us for 15 folks but only provided a paid receipt (in converted USD to pesos) for 14. We had to pay an additional $100 because of this crook. We had a great time, nonetheless. We highly recommend BRUNO from Reef Marina Carine to tour the barrier reef (2nd largest in the world). A large group of us (many kids, too) went snorkeling for the first time and worried about how the kids would fare. BRUNO was AMAZING! Everyone in our party had the best time and we credit it to the small family owned Reef Marina Carine and BRUNO. (They are right on the beach next to RIU Palace Riveria Mya....don't use another tour group if you're interested in snorkeling.)

This was our second trip to this Riu, and our last. My husband and I have been going to different Riu's for the last 8 years and we were so disappointed with this visit. The food was so boring, we have found at different Riu's to be so much better. We have been at different Riu's where their buffet meals were so much better. The themes that they would choose were very festive. The Riu Palace Riviera Maya had none of that. They may have put up a couple of decorations, but that was it. I wasn't even sure what theme night we were even on. We are not picky, honest, but this time we were so disappointed. I have learned from many years to take different items to help with the problems that we have encountered or what we have read. I am going to list a few that might help you when you make your plans. Smell: Remember this is the tropics, I bring a couple of air fresheners to help with the mildew smell in the room. Take a small can of lysol, bug spray, Band-Aids, I take a laundry that zips shut to hold all my dirty laundry, but I also put fabric softener sheets inside to help. I use the air tight bags to bring my clothing, when I leave I put the clean cloths back into the air tight bags along with fabric softener sheets. This helps with the smell of your cloths when you get home. There is a coffee pot in the rooms now, I will now take my own coffee. Their coffee is awful, but that is their coffee and I can not fault them for that. I am picky when it comes to coffee. If the bed is too hard, ask for bed pad, they will bring you one. Catch the maids in the morning or afternoon, (they seem to be there all day) for more linens if needed, they will be happy to bring them too you. We have found that the staff in the buffet was very busy keeping busy setting up the tables instead of taking care of the customers. This is something that we have not experienced before. We always take money for tipping, and this is the first time we came back with tip money. We love the RIU'S, they are a wonderful hotel, we will just visit a different one in November. I will not tell you NOT to go, because it is a beautiful place. We wanted rest and relaxation and we got that. We could go to different inclusive hotels, but I would never change from the RIU's.

But some important recommendations....\u201d", "Author": "IslaMissy", "ReviewID": "UR114947763", "Content": "My boyfriend and I returned from RIU last week and we cannot wait to go back!! The rooms and grounds are absolutely beautiful and perfectly clean. I personally live in the Florida Keys and Miami and I was slightly concerned that there would not be much difference between our beaches and Playa Del Carmen. I was completely wrong! The water is amazing, the beach is clean with beautiful white sands and the water was perfect. I can say nothing bad about the service, cleanliness or view. I just wanted to send out a few recommendations because we read many of these reviews before we booked our trip and we did find it a big help. First of all...we did not know that all the restaurants were NOT open all nights. We were there for 5 nights total and had no problem making reservations for our first 2 nights...FYI, reservations need to be made between 12 and 3pm. This is kind of difficult if you are going to be on an excursion or shopping in town. We wanted to never wear a watch or know what time it was and we did find this kind of annoying. They also only let you book 2 nights of dinner reservations at a time. So anyway...we booked our first 2 nights of dinner reservations with no problem. On the third day we were on an all day excursion so we ate out and were unable to make additional reservations. We were excited to eat at 2 different restaurants for our final 2 nights and were dissapointed to find out that the only 2 that were open were the ones we had already been to!!! I understand that they need to plan and that reservations were needed, but I do wish that we had been informed of this because we would have absolutely choosen different restaurants the first 2 nights in order to try the ones that were actually going to be open towards the end of the week. So don't make that mistake...definately plan out your week so that you can actually take advantage of all the wonderful restaurants that do exist at RIU, we were just not able to enjoy them. Second of all...the pool is very loud. Blasting reggaetone was not exactly relaxing to me, remember I do live in Miami so I was anxious to get away from that type of music:) But no one had to twist my arm to lounge at the beautiful quite beach! There are lots of loud games and drunk people at the swim up bar so the pool isnt exactly the most relaxing location. But they were having a blast and if that is what you enjoy then you will love the pool area! One more thing...because of 2 days of rain we spent some time at the spa. I actually run a spa so I was anxious to see their services. It was \"ok\". Very typical massage, very typical body wrap. Not bad, not the best. Definitely worth going if it is raining...but otherwise there are too many other things to do around town than get an \"ok\" massage. Oh wait, one more thing. You HAVE to go to 5th avenue. The good thing about the miscommunication with the restaurant reservations is that we ended up taking a cap ($7) to 5th avenue. The shopping is amazing, the food is rediculous and there are so many artists to watch and crafts to purchase! We found 5th avenue on day 3 and went back for dinner every night after! Never ate dinner at RIU again hahaha. Highly recommend the authentic Mayan cuisine restaurant on 5th and 22nd, I cannot say enough about this food...sooo different from anything I have ever had and just completely amazing. All in all, RIU was exactly what we were looking for, reasonable prices, very good food, clean, clean, clean, fantastic service, close to shopping and authentic 5 star restaurants, many excursions to choose from. I highly recommend! We felt safe the entire time and although there are many tourists...it is not nearly as commercialized as Cancun and you can absolutely get a real feel of Mexico living. We are actually thinking of renting a house or something in the same neighborhood as RIU next year because we loved it so much and would like to really feel like locals! :) Then again, roomservice, a maid, and breakfast buffet was pretty nice....:) hope this was helpful!", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel poor entertainment\u201d", "Author": "nffc2011", "ReviewID": "UR114918931", "Content": "Very nice hotel but need to do something about eveing entertainment and should cater more for couples/adults instead of kids disco till 9.45 pm.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cwow nice\u201d", "Author": "steve45681", "ReviewID": "UR114823960", "Content": "let me say it was nice lets get started bad 1st housekeeping was the only thing that i could fined anything bad about and it was little like not replacing towles ,worsh cloth 3 time over 8 days not a big deal went out to the halway and got them off the cart or called front desk took care of it riteaway this place was small and i liked it less walking never had a problem getting seats around pool or beech none all week always open chairs some on here said they seen rouches we never seen 1 not saying they dident but we did not the walk to playa would be more like 30 min but safe we took taxie 7$ party hoopers was fun 3 clube from 8;30 to 3am coco bonggo was the best a do not miss thing must do this food was vary good every day chilles was vary good mexican was not but the buffay was good every meal if you felt you needed anything front desk was there and took care of you fast xtra pillows ect. rooms as nice size i would go back to here in a hartbeet this was our 5th trip out of the us and i must say the best 1 for those of you that had problems maybe look at thing a little differnt i go on vac. to have fun relax and injoy my stay i dont let little thing upset me if you try real hard you could find stuff wrong anywhere you go but why try that hard dont swet the small stuff injoy your stay i have never went to a place and everything was that perfect not even at home but this place is vary nice thank you rprm. any ? hit me up ill give you my opion steve45681@yahoo.com", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aurora, IL", "Title": "\u201cGood Food, Good Pool - Loud Resort\u201d", "Author": "travelchristie", "ReviewID": "UR114807800", "Content": "Being a travel agent, I like to review all of the accommodations that I stay in. The RIU Palace Riviera Maya is a beautiful resort, immaculate grounds with excellent food. If you have ever stayed in a RIU property before, then you pretty much know what to expect as almost of their properties are set up the same way. Very \u201ccookie cutter\u201d. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous. All granite, tile and very ornate. Incredibly clean throughout. The Room \u2013 or shall I say - Rooms: The room is nicely appointed. We had a king size bed and it was not hard as a rock! My previous stay at a RIU left me sore and tired, so this was quite a welcome change. The room is all granite and tile. The mini-fridge was full of sodas, water and beer. The liquor dispenser was full. They have wised up and put locks on them now. I have had clients tell me that they used to take the liquor home with them\u2026 not any more! The LCD TV was a bit fuzzy and the technician tried to fix it but gave up on it. Our first two nights were fine, however, one flaw with RIU \u2013 the hallways are so echoey that every drunk going to their room in the middle of the night will wake you up! Also on our 1st night, some drunk pulled the fire alarm at 2:00am and it continued to go off for 30 minutes. I will say, it would indeed wake the dead and you wouldn't sleep through a fire at this resort. Our 3rd night, we returned to our room to a horrible smell and we thought maybe they had sprayed for bugs. The next morning I awoke with a horrifying headache. Turns out they were working on the room next to us and using some caustic chemical that was being sucked into our a/c fan and into our room. We demanded a different room the next morning and were told we would have to wait until 3pm. This did not sit well and we asked for the manager, who immediately upgraded us to a room with a better view and no smell. I was pleased with their quick resolution. There is no WI-FI in the rooms, but it is available in the lobby and complimentary. Pool: The pool is enormous, clean and well maintained. My husband enjoyed the pool volleyball everyday. The beach chairs are ample, but if you want a good one, you better go down at 7:00am to secure one. There are plenty of umbrellas as well. The only complaint is that the towel shack tends to run out of dry towels by 3pm. And this was in the off-season. I would hate to see what time they run out in the busy season. Waiter service around the pool was really slow\u2026 might as well just go get one yourself. The cups for the drinks are small, I recommend you bring your own insulated cup. Many folks did and were able to get a larger drink that didn\u2019t melt right away. Beach: What can I say? It\u2019s huge and beautiful. The water is fabulous. White sugary sand for as far as the eye can see! You could easily walk into Playa del Carmen from the beach in front of the RIU. Food: Delicious! We loved the Japanese Restaurant. We couldn\u2019t get into the Brazilian, but heard it was fantastic. The buffet restaurant was excellent. We also dined at the Krystal, which is a fusion cuisine and it was different but quite yummy. The 24 hour Sports Bar off of the lobby had snacks and microwave available as well, in case you were hungry after 1:00 a.m. The bummer about the Sports Bar was we couldn\u2019t watch the NBA Finals as they didn\u2019t get that channel. The drinks were good and the bartenders did a great job. Tips were certainly appreciated. The room service was prompt but the menu is lacking. Overall, it\u2019s a good resort, quite busy and noisy though so I will move onto a different one in the future.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denton, Texas", "Title": "\u201cI will not go back here\u201d", "Author": "MarcylovesMexico", "ReviewID": "UR114774455", "Content": "We were there from June 18-24th last year we went to the Riu palace mexico do we thought we were up grading to the RPRM but that was not the case.

There was not a lot of food options the Mexican restaurant was not that great the Japanese was my favorite one the steak house was good too. The sausage in the morning was gross it was like fake sausage there was not a lot of chose to choose from in the morning for that matter lunch was not great either.

( They offered lots more trips but we only did the one's I stated) 5.Rooms - 5* - Standard very spacious with Kingsize or twin and sofa/bed . Dressing area, spacious bathroom with Jacuzzi bath and shower over,, double sinks and very large mirror. Hairdryer was great and powerful (Did not use the one I had taken), Iron and ironing board which was useful. Optics for spirits and mini fridge which was filled daily with soft drinks and beer and a Coffee maker .24 hour room service is foc. Adequte balcony with two chairs and a table. Large flat screen tv with lots of american channels and BBC worldwide news service. Bedside radio alarm clock and spacious wardrobes with foc safe. Air conditioning and ceiling fan ( which were both on all day as it was very humid outside!) Note - We asked to change rooms as our STANDARD room was overlooking the air-conditioning from another hotel and this was noisy . Helpful staff changed us the next day from room 2010 to 2035. All standard rooms overlook the outside of the property ther next room grade is the same room but with veiws over the pool/sea.(My brother had one of these rooms.) The next grade is a duplex room with Jacuzzi on the balcony. 6. Restaurants 5*-There were around 5 other restaurants to choose from (reservations need but included in the all-inc price) our fav restaurant was Cristal which was elegant and served Gormet food ( we left the kids with the grandparents for the night who were also on this trip!) I can recommend Cristal but in my opinion the others were not as good as the main buffet restaurant although we did not try the Japanese restaurant. 7. Pool 3*- The only area which let down the holiday a little bit was the Pool. It was very large and had an adjoining 'infinity pool' which had seating to relax. There were also integral sunbeds in the pool and a swim up pool bar with seats at the bar and booth style seating and a couple of jacuzzi's. The pool was deepish ( upto my shoulders) and was the same depth throughout more shallow near the bar area so no diving anywhere. There wasn't a childrens end of the pool but there was a 'paddling pool' size baby pool within the kids club grounds ( not visable from the main pool area). I purchase a Konfidence swim jacket for my youngest son and we used it everyday until one day he said he didn't want to wear it and started to swim by himself ! He is only 5 Years old and he learnt to swim without any floats in Mexico! The pool on some days was quite cloudy and there was somtimes fruit from the cocktails floating around. I did complain about the pool cleanliness and the staff assured me they would look into it- it did look cleaner for the next few days but then it went back to how it was. I also noticed the pool area was only jetwashed daily and not scrubbed like most of the terraced areas surrounding the hotel. The wedding took place in the hotel grounds by the spa area ( fab treatments in the spa would reccomend!) It was a beautiful location over looking the gardens and sea. The wedding was at 5pm but the sun was still blazing down on us . I would recommend that you take your own music. All in all Great hotel which looks magnificent from the road and is the best by far Riu hotel in Riviera Maya /playa del Carmen and better than the Riu Mexico Palace . You can use all other Riu hotels in the area as Palace hotels have a gold wristband which will gains you entry to any of the Riu hotels. Have looked at them all but was glad to be able to go back to this hotel!

Stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico previously. We picked the Riviera Maya because you can easily walk, taxi or bicycle ( available for $5 at the Riu Tequila) into town, which we did 3 times during our week long stay. The beach is unsurpassed, plenty of lounge chairs directly on the sand or under the shade of the palm trees. I must add that the coconuts swaying in the breeze 20 feet above my head did make me a tad nervous. Chairs at the pool area are scarcer, but available as people come & go throughout the day. Enjoyed the daily hamburquesos barbequed on the beach near the pool. The drinks were flowing & the service friendly & quick throughout the grounds. The pool is warmer than I would have liked, not a very refreshing break from the sun & heat. The resort is very clean, with lush vegetation. The buffet is very nice, with a wide variety of culinary options, but it gets repetitive after awhile, as any buffet would. We enjoyed the steakhouse restaurant & especially liked Krystal, the fusion restaurant, where we dined the night of my wife's birthday. The rooms are spacious & we weren't really bothered by the firmness of the mattresses, as others have mentioned. The rooms smell a bit musty due to the humidity, but the room air freshener we brought, helped in that regard. The nightly entertainment was okay, slightly better than a high school production, but still entertaining & energetic. We have previously stayed at the Royal Hideaway & Valentin Imperial Maya, which, on balance we thought were a step above the Riu, but there are differences. The Royal Hideaway is dramatically more expensive & the Valentin is 20 minutes from town by taxi. Also. if you want a day of adventure, sign up for the Extreme Snorkeling package. We swam with sea turtles, rappelled 70 feet, rode zip lines through the jungle & snorkeled in underground cenotes.

I went with my sister-in-law, who was the maid of honor in her best friends wedding, and she asked me to go with her as her \u201cplus one.\u201d We booked through AAA Travel Impressions and everything was taken care of prior to our departure. Transportation from airport to resort was arranged so we didn\u2019t have to worry about paying for a cab. Lobby: The resort is breathtaking from the moment you walk into the lobby. The lobby is huge, with very extravagant chandeliers hanging in three different places. The front desk is off to the right, with the gift shop to the left, and the lobby bar directly ahead. Guest rooms also are on each end, past the desk and gift shop. Rooms: We booked just a standard room, but it was very large and spacious. Big closet with plenty of room for all of our clothes. Two queen beds in the bedroom area. A living room area with a couch and tv. Sliding doors out onto a balcony with a garden view. The bathroom was big, with nice sized tub/shower and comfortable vanity and sinks. There was also a mini-bar that was stocked with vodka, whiskey, brandy, and rum, and in the mini-fridge beer, Cola, Sprite, and bottled water. Pools: two pools - one huge main pool and a smaller infinity pool. The main pool is great, large enough for a water volleyball net and plenty of room for relaxing. There are lounges built right into the water. The swim-up bar is also wonderful. The bartenders are friendly and personable. There are also booths built right into the pool in the bar area, also whirlpools. We took a deck of waterproof cards to play with while in the booths in the bar area. In addition to the swim-up bar, there were waiters running around the whole time, asking people if they needed new drinks while they were lounging in the chairs around the pool, at the booths or under an umbrella in the shade. Beach: picturesque. It honestly felt like I walked into a postcard. Beautiful blue water and soft white sand. There\u2019s not much to say about the beach because it was wonderful with lots of lounge chairs. Food: There was never short supply of food! For breakfast, everyday we ate at the buffet. The selection was large, with something for everyone. Eggs, pancakes, waffles, made-to-order omelets, fruit, cereals, meats, cheeses, breads. For lunch everyday, we ate at the poolside/beach buffet. The selection there was good, salads, pizza, burgers, desserts, fries, chicken, fruits, veggies. I must say that the Riu had a decent selection of food, however there was a lot of \u201cAmerican\u201d food at the buffets, which was a slight disappointment as I expecting some more authentic Mexican dishes. Dinner we ate at different restaurants each night. All were nice, but we had to have reservations at the a la carte restaurants. The Mexican restaurant was great, and we really loved the Brazilian restaurant. There was entertainment throughout the days and into the evenings. Everything from yoga on the beach, target shooting, archery, water aerobics in the daytime, swimsuit fashion shows, dance contests, in the afternoons, and every evening there was a show, ranging from Michael Jackson tribute, Grease, game shows, Vegas show, Mexican dances. One night, before the Vegas show, they had a makeshift casino set up. Each room started with so many points to gamble with, and whatever room ended up with the most points won a prize. My sister-in-law and I came in first place! We won a free massage from the spa! We loved the sports bar at the end of the lobby. Victor the bartender really showed us a good time and made us some fantastic drinks. This bar is also open 24 hours. Room service available for free with a limited menu. The only bad thing about the hotel is that we had some problems with our lock on the door. The battery in the key-card reader kept shorting out and our keys wouldn\u2019t work sometimes, locking us out of our rooms. We would go to the front desk and they sent maintenance to fix the problem. This actually happened to us about three or four times during our week at the resort. Another bad thing was that Hurricane Paula came blowing through during our stay. While it was not Riu\u2019s fault, it was definitely an inconvenience. Our flight home was scheduled for Wednesday, which was cancelled and we were not able to get another flight until Saturday. I had to call off work for an extra two days, and for the extra three night stay, the charge was an additional $600. At first we were shocked and thought it was an astronomical amount, but once we broke it down, it was split between the two of us, so it was $300 each, and then for it to be three days, only $100 per day/night, and it included all of our meals and drinks, etc, so it really wasn\u2019t TOO bad. Once the hurricane finally hit, it ended up only being a storm. The rest of the weather was awesome for the remainder of our extra days, sunny and gorgeous. All in all, it was a good vacation and I would definitely return to this resort in the future and I would feel confident in referring other people to stay here.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delta, B.C.", "Title": "\u201cBest food of three Palaces stayed in over the last 8 months\u201d", "Author": "BCBERN", "ReviewID": "UR113163795", "Content": "Travelled with spouse and another couple.

First time I have experienced beef wellington in a buffet. It was declicious. Many hotels charge extra for lobster but at the Riviera Maya one night it was \"have as much as you like\" and my friend had three. Did the steakhouse for one evening. Service there was great and they do a bit of an act with the \"baked alaska\" which sees one waiter standing over another and creating a cascading falls of burning rum. Quite spectacular. One warning - if you order the rib eye make sure you have lots of appetite. None of my three companions was able to finish theirs. A true platter full. Ate most breakfasts and dinners outside the buffet on the patio. Found the service there to be quite attentive. Also found the front desk staff to be very helpful.

If I was forced to find a negitive then the water in the Pool was way too warm and the debris (Drinking straws & fruit slices) from the pool bar was a bit off-putting. I understand the sun is beating down on the water all day, but if they filtrate the pool properly, this should help cool and clean the water. If I'm in a hot climate I find myself more of a beach & sea kinda person, so the pool would not my 1st choice. And the times I did try it I wasn't a fan. All I would add is if you are EUROPEAN you may find ignoring all the negative comments from the US reviewers helps. If it isn't LIKE AMERICA, they don't like it!

Maintenance was responsive to our one plumbing issue - Mini Bar guy does not know the meaning of \"do not disturb\", even though it was on the door tag in 6 languages.

ENVIRONMENT - Yes, there's a musty smell, and the closer you get to the lobby the stronger it is. we brought a few candles and dryer sheets and our room smelled great! - We got a little creeped out by the comments we read about cockroaches so we plugged the drains, blocked the door with a towel overnight, and left the bathroom light on. I'm sure it was overkill but we didn't have any problem and we were right next door to Chili's. The people across the hall apparently didn't read this page and left their room service dishes outside their door. We did see one of the notorious frog-size roaches on their plate, dead or passed out from eating the crumbs, but again it was in an outdoor hallway.

I was hesitant to stay at a non-adults-only resort but was very pleasantly surprised. All the kids there who were old enough to swim alone were very well behaved. I was sitting in the pool right among them, and had no issues at all! I hate to admit it but I think it was because the American kids I am used to were in school and the kids there were from England and Australia. - Several people commented on the lack of a kids' pool. The shallow area around the in-water loungers were the only place for babies to play, which is how I ended up hanging out with the little ones.

The beach is amazing and the pool is divine. It was very warm and humid but comfortable by the pool and on the beach. They kept our fridge full of bottled water, pepsi, pepsi light, orange fanta and some kind of beer. (we do not drink alcohol) Taxi ride costs $7 each way over to the shopping area. Lomas travel was available in the lobby everyday and that is who we booked our excursions through. Maybe paid a little more for excursions but liked the peace of mind knowing who was picking us up!

You can take a cab for $7 into town from the hotel to walk near a port town where there is a beautiful high end shopping mall which ends at 5th avenue for a mile of more authentic affordable shops interspersed with gelato, pizza, coffee, bars and restaurants. The town is fairly new and progressive. You can take a ferry over to Cozumel from 5th Avenue as well. The resort is set up very well, the nightly music in the plaza each night from 8-10 was lovely, there is a \u201cShow\u201d every night at 10p in the theatre with cocktail service.

Originally allocated a smaller room with tiny balcony on top floor, but reception changed for us immediately with no problem. The room itself was very comfortable I normally struggle to sleep on holiday but the bed was really comfortable, no dampness in room as described in other reviews, but this could be down to the air con as had this at a previous hotel we used both air con and the fan to keep the room really fresh! The Thomson Rep Emma was excellent even sending us a card on our anniversary and sending us notes after our excursions to make sure we had a good time, food was great in all a la carte restuarants had our anniversary in Krystal and the table was decorated beautifully, the beach is fantastic as was the infinity pool and the bars are all well stocked and the staff in the bars especially Victor in the Sports Bar were second to none, the place is spotlessly clean (apart from the odd bit of sun lotion residue in the main pool) but we avoided the main pool as most of the swim up bar residents (mostly loud Americans) sat there all day without leaving their seats to answer the call of nature, so decided to swerve that!! Trip wise Xplor, Tulum & Xel Ha were amazing, however the highlight was the Whale Shark swim (however don't buy this from your rep or Scuba Caribe by the pool as we got this for half their prices from the tour stall in Playa Plaza 300 mts to the left of the hotel. Last year we did the Coba Mayan Village and the Jungle speedboat tours these are great too The gym could do with some more updated equipment but it served its purpose. Definitely go int o Playacar and also take time to look round the Mayan ruins which lie 300 mts to the right og the hotel and there are some more just before Playa Del Carmen All in all a fantastic holiday and a place I'd go back to in a heartbeat!!", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gallatin, TN", "Title": "\u201cNot sure it's a 5 star\u201d", "Author": "Karenscruises", "ReviewID": "UR110238505", "Content": "Boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nts beginning the 14th until the 18th after staying for 4 nts at the RIU Cancun beginning 5/10-14. Overall I'd say this is a very good property but not sure it's for us. Here are my thoughts: SERVICE---Some areas excellent, some could use improvement. The service in the courtyard area at night was pretty slow. Requested a Dirty Martini w/specific instructions on type of liquor and olives....had to get the head waiter to get it right on the 4th attempt. All waitstaff in the restaurants, top notch. Did not have any beach service at all and very little at the pool--only when stopped someone as they walked by...no one came by and offered to take an order. This was a big difference between RIU Cun and RPRM b/c at Cancun, we were constantly brought drinks to the beach as well as the pool area--and no did not tip any extra at either place. Benjamin on the front desk was very professional and courteous. Big thank you to him for our gorgeous room. FOOD---Very good...especially the Mexican restaurant. Kudos to Rene!! Thanks for the laughs. Also Chili's, the Steak House, was very very good. Baked Alaska excellent. Head waiter excellent and very professional. CLEANLINESS---Our room was great. Loved the towel animals and special touches. Would have liked to have more than 2 bath towels but housekeeping brought extra immediately when requested. Courtyard, sidewalks and hallways were constantly being cleaned. Pool area not so great. Water was dingy and noticed serveral tiles missing from wall of pool were the tables were. Swim up Bar area had staws in it and alot of sand on floor. LOCATION---Really liked the Playacar area. Definitely would recommend this area and would return. 5th Ave awesome. ENTERTAINMENT---Altho we were very impressed w/the stage shows, it looked as if there were a few nights that would have been good shows later in the week. The singers and bands in the gazebo and courtyard area were good but definitely not my style. Not alot to do after dinner. Overall, Great property and had a good time! Suggestions....would be nice to have bicycles to rent to go to 5th Ave and sightseeing. Also property very spread out. Could use another elevator in addition to the one near the lobby. I think RPRM is a beautiful property and perfect for an older crowd. Not many singles here at all.

The food was good, nothing that a foodie would write home about but it was plentiful and did the job needed. There is top shelf liquor however you need to request it when having your drinks made.

I have always tipped a few dollars for wait staff at breakfast, lunch and dinner and especially for the cleaning staff as they work so hard and such long hours! I know that some people have reported that there were cockroaches at the resort but we did not see any, no bugs at all in fact, and never have in the past either. The one recommendation that I have is bring a few extra beach towels from home as the pool towels never fully cover up the chairs. Also not a lot of people knew about the little stretch of stores and shops down the road beside the Riu Tequila. It is within walking distance and I prefer it over 5th Ave down in Playa Del Carmen.

From Cancun airport we were taken to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. When we approached the area of PlayaCar, we were blown away by the other hotels and areas. As one of our friends said \"OMG look at that hotel it's amazing!!\" we drove into the drive of the Riu and couldn\u2019t believe this was where we were staying. Going inside you are immediately taken in by the welcoming smiles and glistening chandeliers. Getting checked in was easy. My fianc\u00e9 and I didn\u2019t like our rooms view so I asked reception for an upgrade and got room 2111 with a great view of the gardens. This room did smell a little damp but it had no affect on our enjoyment of the holiday. We visited a few other people's rooms and theirs smelt fine. The beds were absolutely fine. Seeing complaints that they were too firm is ridiculous! Despite a damp smell and \"firmness\" I slept like a baby for 10 nights no problems! The rooms were cleaned every day of course and many times I left my Tiffany necklace on the side and it would still be there when I got back, so that's a good point. The sports bar was great! only at night though and only if Victor is working! lol. With his friendliness and eagerness to get you wasted, you will be stumbling out of the sports bar at 3am filled with cocktail shots! The restaurants were great! The buffet one is perfect for breakfast and dinner and the Japanese restaurant was great too. The pool was warm and the staff were great getting you drinks. On the odd occasion you might even get the pizza man from Chili\u2019s coming round with fresh slices for you to nibble on. We also had the pleasure of having a BBQ on the beach which was great with a side of salsa lessons! On May 9th....My fianc\u00e9 and I got married!!! We wed at 3pm at the gazebo and it was the most beautiful day of our lives. Nancy our wedding co-coordinator did everything we asked of her and our day was perfect. The reception table was apparently a little dross before we arrived so my maid of honor and best man tidied it up a bit. so if you choose to get married here, have someone on hand to have a quick look at the table layout. We had our reception at Chili\u2019s and the food was great! we had a private section and the waiters kept the champagne flowing! Our cake was wonderful too. Vanilla cake with strawberry filling and white icing. The only downside with the reception was that dinner was at 18:45 and we had to be out by 20:30. So speeches and gift giving we had to wrap up pretty quickly. But again, no negative effect on our day what so ever! On our last night in Mexico a few of us went to Coco Bongos in Playa Del Carmen and let me tell you that this is an experience not to be missed!!! I can\u2019t say whether my mum or nan would enjoy it but for us youngsters is was AMAZING!!!! Ladies if you go to Coco Bongos wear a tight dress at least thigh length. WARNING: If you wear a light flowy short dress and dance on the bar like some girls did, air will be blown up your dress and everyone will get a look at your private bits! But again such an amazing experience! You have no idea where to look!! There's so much going on!! Balloons falling from the ceiling, paper blown, bubbles floating, The Mask, Chicago, Usher, MJ! The list goes on!!! Anyway, I'm veering off! Look, if you are easily pleased at a fabulous hotel in a fabulous country with a fabulous beach and plenty of things to do, this is the place!! If you are used to la de da quiet, boring 8 star hotels, don't bother. Anyone who has written a bad review on this place has no bloody idea what roughing it is!

The location was great, within 15 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride into Playa, I would recommend walking along the road into Playa rather than the beach, as you can see some Mayan ruins and Iguanas along the way, and it's easier and quicker than the beach route.

The beach is our #1 priority when choosing a hotel and this place meet our expectations! The waters have several shades of turquoise water, sandy soft white beach with plenty of chairs either in the shade or sun. The water was perfect for swimming in for hours if you wanted \u2013 not too rough, not very deep, sandy bottom, no rocks no seaweed. The beach did have shells washed up on shore so you did have to watch your step. You could find some nice shells. The beach was big enough to walk in either direction to check out other resorts. On your way out to the beach to the right, under the palm trees, you\u2019ll find several hammocks. Very nice and relaxing to take a nap in during the day or even after dinner. The pool was very nice and big - you could be at the pool/pool bar and see the ocean at the same time. We didn\u2019t have a huge problem finding chairs around the pool. One morning we still found chairs around 8 am and other days we didn\u2019t go to the pool area till the afternoon and still found chairs. Good drink service around the pool. On Sunday they even had a \u201cmobile\u201d bar going around the pool area and someone grilling brats and hot dogs on the beach, which was nice. Overall we were all pleased with the food \u2013 usually a good selection and tasted good. All the desserts we tried were fairly tasty, which was a surprise. Had buffet our 1st night (Sat) and everyone was very pleased with the HUGE selection - Seafood assortment pasta station, fish, beef, & chicken, make your own pasta. Every night they had 2 special entr\u00e9e selections \u2013 lamb, beef wellington, beef tenderloin, salmon, chicken, etc. Breakfast was always good with plenty to choose from \u2013 omelet station, french toast, pancakes, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, cereal, fruit, pastries, etc. Dinners: Our second night we ate at the Mexican restaurant \u2013 it was decent, but not our favorite. At Chili\u2019s we tried the ribeye (good) and surf and turf (which was shrimp skewers), dessert \u2013 baked Alaskan (ice cream) \u2013 good. Our favorite was probably Krystal \u2013 2 of us had the beef filet (very good) and 2 had sea bass (good but not as good as filet) \u2013 they had the BEST chocolate cake for dessert! The beef entrees at the Japananise restaurant were good as well \u2013 but they don\u2019t cook in front of you. We didn\u2019t make it to the Brazilian. It was a drawback having to get to the lobby around noon to make dinner reservations, you could make 2 reservations at a time, waited for about 15 minutes each time, lines moves fairly fast. 4 of the 5 restaurants only had 2 seating times either 6:45 or 8:45. We only caught one of the shows \u2013the Michael Jackson show \u2013 very good. The shows change each week. We did see one cockroach on the floor while sitting in the courtyard one night after dinner having drinks. One BIG improvement the hotel does need to make is with the workout room. For a 5 star hotel \u2013 this is the worst workroom we\u2019ve seen. Hardly any equipment and all very old and outdated. Even went to the other Palace hotel to use their workout room and just as bad. If you like to run outside, there is a nice 4-mile loop within the Playacar gated complex. We took a day trip to Cozumel. Caught the 8 AM ferry ($54 roundtrip for 2 adults) my husband went Scuba Diving at Blue Magic in the morning, we rented a jeep and drove around the island for the day stopping at several bars/restaurants (Wet Wendy\u2019s, Coconuts & Chen Rio)and of course shopping. A fun day trip! No security issues within the hotel or Mexico in general.

The beach was beautiful! We booked through Funjet Vacations and were extremely disappointed with them. We originally booked the Riu Palace Mexico and after researching I realized what we wanted was the Riu Palace Riviera Maya (properties 1/2 mile from each other). I called Funjet and the agent assured me there was only one property and I was booked at the correct hotel. When we arrived, we saw they are NOT the same hotel. The Riu Palace Mexico where we were dropped was a much smaller, very quiet hotel with an average hotel guest age of about 70 years old. The Riu Palace Riviera Maya was a younger crowd and a much larger, livelier hotel. We approached the Funjet rep in the hotel lobby who said it would be no problem to transfer us to the other, he just needed to call his office to confirm. After THREE AND A HALF HOURS of waiting and run around \"waiting for a call back\", we were told the \"upgrade\" to the other hotel in a LESSER room than we originally booked was going to cost an additional $850 for 4 nights!!!! Funjet/Lomas Travel was extremely unprofessional and con artists at best. We went to the front desk and arranged to be transferred \"internally\" direct thru Riu without any Funjet/Lomas involvement for $100. We were so disappointed in Funjet for having wasted our first day in paradise waiting in a hotel lobby. The food at Riu was ok. Just ok. Don't expect anything great. We were also very disappointed that they do not allow you to eat at one of the restaurants your first night. It is mandatory buffet. The second day we stood in line for an hour and a half to get on the reservation list for a restaurant for that evening and of course, they were all booked. Buffet the second night as well. We did get reservations for the 3rd night for the \"steak house\" and it was better than the buffet, but the food was, again, just ok. Waitstaff was very attentive most of the time and try their best. Overall a decent hotel. The grounds are beautiful, rooms are clean and helpful staff everywhere.

But\u2026this is where all of the service stopped ! After this we never had the feeling we were of a diamond class level. Meaning : no bottle of \u201cchampagne\u201d and strawberry\u2019s like other new arrivals received. Not once, (during 14 nights), experienced the turn-down service in our suite room, and they had this service in operation, as we saw ! Noted this to the front desk but without any result. First week the food in the restaurant was great, large selection and beautifully presented. Starting from the second week we taught that we were in a different hotel ! Less selection and, (very clearly), cheaper ingredients were served now ! Clearly the level of food supply is directly according to the price level of that period. Lobster was available in the steak house in the first week but not any more in the second. Also chocolate fountain\u2026first week yes, second \u2026good bye fountain ! During our visit one of the head- waiters \u201cdiscovered\u201d after a few questions to us, that we had a RIU diamond class card and he promptly suggested to send for a bottle of \u201cchampagne\u201d to our room\u2026nothing appeared there. An other head-waiter (steakhouse) promised us lobster at the second visit during our stay\u2026sorry no lobster available any more. We didn\u2019t ask for all these things but, a promise is a promise, and if you cannot accomplish what you\u2019re promising, then you better shut up. It would be a lot easier for us to live with. Being in a Palace 5* hotel, one should expect that there is a minimum of etiquette. Here we noticed that, in contradiction with was is written in our brochure, certain type of guests came to diner in shorts that sometimes looked more swimming or beachwear. Even in a few of the theme restaurants, were clearly was marked \u201cNO SHORTS\u201d they appeared, nothing was said against this, but I\u2019m sure that other guests were not happy with this. Expect a lot of noise from entertainment during your restful ours at the swimming pool. Coming from aerobics in the pool\u2026loud music, bingo every day and water polo game. Some shows during the evening entertainment were good e.g. the Maya show (again\u2026only performed during the first week) was very nice. The performance of the Mariachi\u2019s was disappointing ! We re-visited this show at the RIU Palace Mexico and noticed that there it was completely different and very nice ! Also other aspects we saw there, when visiting our friends, gave us the impression that we had chosen for the wrong hotel, and didn\u2019t supplied us with a feeling of satisfaction although the price we have paid for this. (+6.400 US dollar for two). Luckily you will find also a lot of positive points around\u2026 The resort is still in a perfect state, the beach is even more nice than during our previous visit 2.5 years ago, and the drinks they serve, especially in the Lirico bar were of a high quality where in the La Habana bar the bartender was, in my opinion, sometimes quite arrogant. Cleaning of room and all other public areas is perfect, waiter service in (main !) restaurant, la Plaza and on the swimming pool is very good.

Our stay felt luxurious, not skimpy, even thought its all inclusive. Loved the beautiful beach and spacious pool. Staff was friendly and funny. Food was great. we walked to 2 other nearby Riu's and thought the food at our place was better. Free minibar with sodas, water, beer in room. Enjoyed breakfast room service 2 days. Pool was pleasant temperature, even warm. I am pregnant but still found non alcoholic pool drinks and staff helpful with milk(leche) to drink at meals. Some organized activities- beach volleyball, water aerobics. loved having them bring us drinks at our chairs. The good- food was great, room was comfy and clean with whirlpool tub. Head left out of hotel front door for 5-10 minutes and find small tourist shopping plaza and a starbucks! Cozumel ferry a few miles up beach. we didn't go but fellow guests spent the day over there with rental car. Nice lobby bar at night. Beach and pool super relaxing. Ocean was great to swim/float in, nice temperature and color. Resort is very clean, they clean the floors all over a lot. Enjoyed the steakhouse especially but the non-reservation dinner restaurant was great too. Room service quick and on time. The challenges- you should know its 50 minute shuttle ride from airport but gorgeous once you are there. Room service nachos and tostadas arrived chilled not warm, some milk arrived warmed not cold (apparently customs are different there) so you might specify more than we did. Evenings are a little slow- shows at 9:45pm are ok. perhaps if i was not pregnant and could have a drink might have enjoyed them more?? nearby riu had disco but we didn't go. Noise: after 7am carts with breakfast, etc roll down the tile hall and I am light sleeper. I brought a fan which helped some.

Mainly adult guests - not a lot of school aged children around . Got upgraded to a room with a huge balcony and pool/garden view (2075). Rooms are good with entrance area, bathroom to right and bedroom/sitting area to left. Beds are a bit small for 2 people but very comfy. Execellent choice of drinks in room - bacardi and smirnoff on optics and soft drinks/beer in the fridge. Decent TV station choice though geared to Americans. Everywhere is very well kept. The food is excellent. Managed to try all the speciality ones without too much bother though you have to get there at midday on the dot to book. Best were the Japanese and Chilis. The Brazilian one is the worst - meat, meat and more meat. They don't seem to change the menus though so the food gets a bit samey. Evening entertainment was a bit naff - mostly consist of people dancing or miming to records. Staff are lovely - helpful and smiley. We stayed mainly on the beach where there were no problems getting loungers and they have 6 hammocks to use which are great. Lovely warm sea with a bit of low surf. If you are walking to Playa del Carmen go by road not along the beach - it is much quicker. Thought 5th Avenue was awful - full of tatt. For souvenirs, Playacar plaza is fine with about a dozen shops and is about 5 minutes walk away.

We stayed five nights and were mainly looking to get away and relax after a particularly stressful couple of months. We were a little worried about Mexico in general due to the travel warnings and all the reports of crime and deaths. Despite hearing reports of incidents in Cancun (that happened while we were down there) on our trip back to the U.S., we never had any incidents or times when we felt unsafe or uncomfortable in Riviera Maya. All in all, we really enjoyed our time at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya! This was our first time staying at a Riu property. We were looking for an all inclusive experience and got one. Here are some thoughts: -The transfer from the Cancun airport to the hotel is long. It took at least an hour each way and the road you're mostly on is fairly annoying with lots of speed bumps. -The first impression of the hotel is a very grand one. The lobby area is very stately. -Our room was clean and suited our needs just fine. We had asked for a queen or king bed (can't remember which one) and they ended up shoving two doubles together. It was kind of weird...but it worked. My complaint was the beds were pretty stiff though. A LOT of noise comes into the rooms from the outside hall. That was our biggest complaint about the room. It made it tough to sleep at times. We stayed on the first floor...the main floor. We did have to ask/remind the staff for a couple of things. Our refrigerator broke and we needed them to fix that. We had to ask a couple of times for more towels or all of the towels (e.g., we'd have bath towels but no washcloths.) We also had to ask several times for them to restock our fridge (we wanted more water and beer). We figured out by the end, once we started tipping, that had we done that all along, they might've been more responsive. - While this is all inclusive, and that claims to cover tips, it's quickly apparent that tipping will result in better/faster service overall...anywhere in the resort. You'll want to make sure you have pesos for that. -We don't have gourmet tastes...so we were always able to find something to eat. If you place a high value on food or are a \"foodie,\" you might be disappointed in the offerings. We had read a number of disappointed reviews on the food and we can understand why now if that's something that's important to you. It was nice that you could find something to eat at anytime of the day though. We never took advantage of the 24-hour room service or the liquor bar in the room...but they are cool nonetheless. -I've read that people didn't care for the drinks or thought they were watered down. You can always find beer, wine, champagne and lots of frozen fruity drinks at the pool. Will they have the same drinks you drink at home...probably not...but that was okay for us. Again, we were always able to find something. And if you're worried about the alcohol not packing enough of a punch, just go to the Sports Bar and do shots like we did. You'll be set and packing it in early! :) -You need to pay attention when you check in to learn the rules for reservations for the specialty restraurants. You have to make reservations for these places a couple days in advance and you can only make the reservations in the lobby area between 12-3 I think it was. You will want to plan ahead if your plans for the day take you away from the hotel. The good news is there is a buffet you can always fall back on if you don't have reservations elsewhere. -We found the pool area awesome and spent most of our time there! Pool loungers are hard to come by...so there would be an advantage to getting up and laying claim to some before they're all gone. Each day, we would find chairs, put our stuff there and then go about our activities...whether at the beach or pool. -The beach area is also very cool.. with lots of varied places to relax, sit and lie out. -We never did any off-site activities (e.g., Maya ruins, ziplining, golf) but there are travel reps in the lobby every day if you want to make arrangements to do so. A lot of different activities are offered by a number of different companies. -The hotel is really good about offering activities throughout the day...mainly at the pool area. We participated in some of them. -While there was nightly entertainment offered (and it varied each night), this hotel is missing something more livelier and something that goes longer at night. We had inquired about the nearest club, but it was down the street 15 minutes at another Riu property and we didn't feel safe walking there. A dedicated club or more lively bar, with music and dancing, is needed. -We never took advantage of the spa, but we saw people going in there quite a bit and booking services. We would certainly go back and I would say we had a good experience overall!

This is our 6th all inclusive \u2013 other resorts in Mexico we have stayed at include the Valentin and Grand Palladium. The Riu really should be commended for their excellent service \u2013 we remember this from our stay in Jamaica and the RPRM did not disappoint. I have to say that the service we had at the Valentin 3 years ago does not compare at all to the Riu. At the Riu \u2013 there is never a long wait for drinks, getting seated at a table, getting coffee in the morning at the buffet, or getting waited on at the front desk. Also, it seems there detail to maintaining the grounds and cleanliness are superb. We saw workers scrubbing down the sides of the pool and pool deck \u2013 always working on something. Food was great \u2013 nothing above and beyond compared to other all inclusives, but still always a good variety. My favorite restaurant was the Brazilian \u2013 great service and wonderful food. The morning buffet had a wide variety of choices \u2013 loved the potato cakes. The steak at the steak house was good \u2013 the filet with lobster was even better. The Japanese was my least favorite. Standing in line was not ideal to make dinner reservations. The two days we got there at 12 noon- there was a line, and the lady had not even shown up yet \u2013 she ran about 15 minutes late both times. Pool and Beach \u2013 I love all the palm trees \u2013a great combination of sun and shady spots everywhere. The beach is gorgeous. The animation team was just the right amount of activity \u2013 never too intrusive but still a good amount of fun activities and music by the pool. I like the smaller size of this resort \u2013 everything is well within a reasonable walk and the resort layout is a U shape. Room \u2013 Here is where the Riu could use a facelift. The room is adequate \u2013 large, clean and the basic amenities. They really do need an update with their linens and furniture and electronics (flat panels, new lamps are needed). Our bed linens were not soft and noticeably worn with a hole or two. We had no issue with cockroaches \u2013and I did check around since I read about the issue before I left. We did meet another family who complained of one of their rooms having cockroaches. Being it\u2019s a warm, tropical location \u2013I would expect they are around \u2013 you just hate to see them. Also I should mention that musty smell---not sure why the Riu has that smell so much worse than other resorts we have stayed at \u2013 we met another couple that mentioned the same thing. You get used to it \u2013keep your slider open while your in your room to get some fresh air\u2026.and just plan on washing all of your clothes when you get home. We had one unfortunate incident with money being stolen from our safe. Our first night there, we returned to our room to find out our key card no longer worked \u2013 very odd they would de-magnetize only 4 hrs. after arriving to the resort. The other key card was in the room \u2013 and that was deactivated also. Upon getting that resolved and entering our room, our safe was wide open with about 1/3rd of our money gone. It\u2019s a very weird incident considering not all of the money was taken, and nothing else in the safe was taken. My guess is that the individual doesn\u2019t want it to be appear as if anything is gone. We are 100% certain our safe was locked \u2013the last thing we did before we left the room was lock the sliding glass door, pull the shades closed, lock the safe \u2013and I actually always pull on the safe door to assure it\u2019s locked. They started an investigation and did find out that someone entered our room that evening while we were gone\u2013 they are just not sure how they breached the safe since the code is a unique code we picked. The master code is only known by management at the resort and it takes a special computer thing they hook into the safe to open it. We had approximately 4 meetings with the manager & assistant manager and they were actually very responsive (although they did not believe us at first). They ended up taking out our entire safe and replacing it, and reimbursing us. I have to give kudos to our Fun Jet representative at the resort \u2013 Joel from Lomas Travel- who was so helpful with this incident. He also filled out a report and helped translate when we needed it. He checked in with us everyday to see if we had an update on the investigation \u2013 great service. Please make sure your safe is locked and if you notice it\u2019s open ---count all of your money to assure nothing is taken. Overall this is a beautiful resort --- I would rate it as 3.5 stars compared to the other all inclusives we have stayed at.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cPretty good\u201d", "Author": "Hkmcupcake", "ReviewID": "UR105500808", "Content": "My family went for spring break. Mostly it was wonderful. We had a suite at the end by the pool/beach so we didn't have any noise. The beds are terribly uncomfortable and we did have hundreds of tiny ants and some cockroaches. The staff came with a bottle of raid that we kept for the week. We didn't have any more ants but the cockroaches kept coming. The room itself was beautiful, a nice big balcony, big bath, and very meticulous housekeeping staff. The pool is nice, the beach beautiful with lots of shade. My daughters were shocked by some topless sunbathers on the beach. The kids club is very small. Basically a dog run. The staff were phenomenal, very friendly and helpful. The food at the buffet was great (especially breakfast) but the specialty restaurants were mostly a waste of time. The Japanese restaurant was ok, nothing special. The steakhouse was horrible (beef doesn't seem to be their specialty). Krystal was pretty good, and the Mexican restaurant was very good. You can make reservations for 3 days when you wait in line from 12-3. We had no problem getting reservations but my husband went up before noon and waited in line. The drinks in the lobby bar are MUCH better than those poolside - worth the walk. The red wine is horrible. Stick to beer and mixed drinks from the lobby. The entertainment was good but starts at 9:45 which makes it hard to see with small children. Excursion travel agents work out of the lobby and were very helpful. We went to Tulum (fabulous) and for an ATV jungle ride to tour cenotes (underground freshwater caves)..also fabulous. We went on the $35 snorkel boat ride from the water sports company on the beach and that was fun as well, saw lots of fish. I agree it's not the best hotel for those with disabilities. Limited elevators and stairs, very slippery hallways! We felt totally safe, enjoyed the staff, immaculate and beautiful grounds, beautiful rooms (aside from bugs and hard as rock beds), and I've never seen a prettier beach. The natural shade from palm trees was plentiful, although there is also plenty of sun space as well. We would go back but would not waste time at the steakhouse. Live music played in the plaza in the evening which was nice. 5th avenue is fun to go shopping. The $30 sunscreen from the store is true (we had to buy it). The water is not safe to drink from the tap. The restaurant water is safe. They stock your mini bar every day. Our air conditioning didn't work all that well, running full blast, turned down as low as possible. It was never cool in our room and they said our room was too big to cool anymore.

Towels at the pool area were shabby, but if that is my only complaint I will survive. Some people mentioned little alcohol in the drinks. I did notice this at the swim up bar with frozen drinks. My husband drank rum and cokes which were super strong. I drank pina coladas and after the first few (which I think may have been virgin), I just asked for extra rum and had no problems after that. It was only the swim up bar that we had this problem with. The lobby bar and even the walk up portion of the swim bar were fine. We go to bed early and get up early, so I can't comment on the nightlife, but we had fun at the casino night and just hanging out at the lobby bar. I do not reccomend massages at the spa.

We have been to many Riu s and this was by far the best. The Palace is located inside of Playacar which is about as safe as you can get in Mexico, we NEVER felt unsafe. It was a mile walk or $7 cab ride to 5th street which is a MUST DO, it is a mile long of awesome shops, restaurants and hotels. 5ty street is mellow compared other Mexico markets. There is also a good size shopping area the opposite direction inside Playacar across from the other Rius. On our trip we went to Cozumel and did the snorkeling and tour excursion, was good value for the money and not a lot more than the ferry itself. We took a cab to Mayakoba golf course and also stopped by Walmart and never felt unsafe. (we picked up extra water, Gatorade and Pedialite to keep hydrated, worked well!). Pros: Just about everything. Great staff, clean as can be, great pool and HUGE beach. Very clean beach with only a vendor or 2 a day, very relaxing and the water was amazing! Millions of cool shells everywhere you looked. Victor from the sports bar was awesome! There is also a golf course across the street which is handy. The buffet was great! the food is usually bland and caters to the Euros but this time it was pretty good and there was lobster, tons of seafood and good theme nights. Cons: The entertainment was sub par. The hallways were very loud so bring earplugs. The specialty restaurant was no better than the buffet. If you want to nit pick the wireless signal was poor but note to self you are on vacation.... A few roaches but hey you are in the jungle, duh! Overall it was a great trip, you have to be a real donkey to find things to complain about or your standards are a little above what you are paying for, so if you dont like it go somewhere else. As far as Americans being loud or rude I didnt find that at all and also noticed the Americans and Canucks were the only ones tipping! This was a very affordable, safe, and great location.

Wich is the only place they have wifi. It was exhausting! Making reservations for restaurants is another issue. You can't just call. You must everyday walk to the lobby and stand in a long line in the middle of the day from 12-3pm and make a reservation. Aftter all of the reservations are full and they fill up fast it's the buffet for you. Breakfast and lunch are always the same. Now evening restaurants are very good. We often went by the two seating times available for dinner and looked in to see empty tables, and very small restaurants. . So if they say they are booked go anyway and they will seat you. We did this 3 times. They don't waste anything in all inclusive. So if you saw it on the breakfast buffet and there was left overs it will be somewhere in another restaurant....the pool was amazing and beach was amazing and they cleaned your rooms well.

The drive from the airport to the hotel is about 45 minutes along depending on the traffic. Thats really the only downside about the hotel but once you get here you will forget the distance. Most of the hotels in this area(PLAYACAR) are within walking distance from one another. There is a shopping plaza called 5th avenue with many names you will recognize from the US. However be ready to pay a high price for many things. Inside the hotel...the staff at reception were very helpful at all times. All the staff was friendly and eager to help.

Unfortunately none of these rooms have a view to the ocean but in my opinion if you are going with little kids you dont want the courtyard or ocean view as there is usually a nightly show with loud music which might cause a problem for some. The maid service was good. They did tend to clean later in the day but that was good for us because we could shower and be ready leasurely and then they would clean the room. The beds were a little firm but firm is good from what I've read. If you require an extra bed they are more than willing to give you a roller bed for no charge. The beach and pool was wonderful. Water temperature was just fine once you get in. We went with two boys 12 and 14 and there was alot of activities to keep them busy,including rifle shooting. They do have water activities such as jet skiing and parasailing but at a cost. Boogie boards and snorkling equipment was free of charge as were the kayaks and catamaranes if you went by yourself.

The location is PERFECT in our opinion; a safe (we went for an evening run without issue), gated villa community on a gorgeous stretch of beach. Walking distance (20 mins) to Playa del Carmen and the marina or a $7 cab ride. The hotel and decor are 'grand' with immaculately landscaped grounds - just beautiful. Our room was a ground floor king suite that was spacious, clean with good air conditioning and a balcony. A large closet and electronic safe as well as mini-bar (stocked daily) topped the room amenities off nicely! We found it more than adequate for an all-inclusive stay and the bed was also quite comfy. Most people lounge AROUND the pool and not IN it so we found the size to be adequate. There were kids in the pool but they weren't disruptive at all; those not wanting to see or hear children should probably book adult-only resorts... :-) Yes, there was the typical lounge-chair jockeying going on where people probably woke up at the crack of dawn to 'reserve' chairs, but we always found 2 loungers together and we never got down to the beach/pool area before noon! Takes more searching but it wasn't impossible The beach itself is beautiful and manicured with ample sun and shaded spots...and a dreamy section of hammocks! Beverage service on the beach and at the pool was great - waiters would come by often to refill drinks and clear empty cups. Never got harassed by sales persons while down there. What impressed me the most were the food and staff; best I've ever experienced at an all-inclusive and this was my 4th such trip. The buffet and a la carte restaurants were phenomenal! Always found plenty to suit our tastes and happy to see such varied healthy options. Hardboiled eggs were not cooked all the way through about half the time for breaky but that's my only complaint on food. We ate at Agave (Mexican), Chilis (Steakhouse) and Yashima (Japanese) restaurants and all were OUTSTANDING! By the way, we ordered room service twice and the service was impeccable - food was yummy and when we ordered a bottle of wine to the room, they brought it with a rose 'for the lady'...loved it! :-) The staff were always courteous, welcoming, and very helpful. The entertainment staff are great - so warm and a lot of fun and one of the things we remember most fondly. Evening entertainment was typical 'all-inclusive' recipe including cheesy cabaret singer and evening show which were fun and added to the experience. We would have liked to see more to do in the evenings after dinner and after the evening show, but the resort itself seems to be geared towards 'quiet after 11pm'. Even one of those cheezy little discos tucked away in a corner would have been a good option for those of us who wanted to do a little dancing without going into town...but this too, wasn't a big drawback. Just to make this a well-rounded review I'll mention the minor snags we encountered: - Sound does carry A LOT in the hallways and the doors do slam shut which is disturbing while trying to relax/sleep. Earplugs will be the only way around this issue - it's just the way the place is built. - Hot water in the shower was an issue one day but was restored quickly. The shower pressure is weak but workable. Another pressure issue was toilet flushing...most times good - occasionally a couple flushes required. - Room keys are easily demagnetized (that was the explanation we were given) so we had to make several trips the one day to the front desk to get that sorted out. Turns out our door lock had to be reprogrammed but no issues after that. - I have several mosquito bites from them getting into the room while it was being cleaned but it is a warm environment so bugs come with the territory (advice: bring mosquito repellant and After-bite) - Hotel convenience store is morbidly over-priced ($30US for sunscreen) so don't forget anything at home! hehe Overall a great experience and one we wouldn't hesitate to repeat or recommend to anyone.

It was really nice to have a first-hand report about the resorts, restaurants, and activities, and it helped us plan our short get-away. We stayed at the Riu for 4 nights at the end of March. Since we usually vacation onboard a cruiseship, this was a very different experience for us. It was our first All-Inclusive resort. Here's our thoughts: The Good: Wow, this place is beautiful! The lobby is stunning, the courtyard is beautiful, and the pool and beach were breathtaking. All staff was very welcoming and friendly. Apple Vacations did a great job of organizing our trip. They were extremely efficient and helpful. The resort, grounds, and pool area was emaculate. Our small room was clean and had all we needed. We went into Playa Del Carmen two of the evenings and had a great time! Carboncitas (right off 5th Ave.) was our favorite restaurant! Poolside activities were fun, and we enjoyed the beach BBQ. The Bad: Both on the phone, and in an email, I requested a room on the lower floor close to the pool and beach. I was assured my request would be honored. We were placed in a 3rd floor room as far away from the pool as possible! While the food was EXCELLENT on the buffets, we were disappointed that we were not able to get into the special restaurants. Reservations needed to be made during the day (12 - 3pm) for the following evenings. We arrived too late our first day to make reservations, and when I went to make the reservations on our second day, all restaurants were full except for one of our available evenings. We did get into the gourmet restaurant on our last night. It was just ok. We enjoyed breakfast in the buffet, but we aren't really \"buffet people\" for all three meals so this was disappointing. There was NO nightlife at this resort. They did have a show each evening, but that was it. These type of singing and dancing shows are just not something we enjoy. Other than sitting at the bar, there was nothing to do. The UGLY: There were NO poolside chairs available after 8:00 in the morning!! All chairs were empty except for a towel or a book! The signs all say they do not allow saving chairs, but it certainly isn't enforced. Who gets up at 6 am to reserve a pool chair on their vacation?? We did get great chairs on the beach, and they could be moved to your choice of sun or shade. We are not big drinkers and partiers, but we do enjoy a drink or two in the evening. My husband drinks gin on the rocks, and was happy to see the Beefeater's and Gordon's bottles on the bar. However, the liquid in the bottle was definately NOT gin! It didn't smell like gin, and certainly didn't taste like gin! The vodka was the same way. (This was the same at the bar and in the liquor dispenser in our room.) Beer was ok, but no American beer was available. Tequila seemed fine. Based on Tripadvisor reviews, we ate at a restaurant called \"Season Bistro\" in Playa del Carmen. It had been the #1 choice for weeks. We were NOT happy with our $100 dinner. Service was extremely slow and the food was horrible. All in all, we did enjoy our short trip to warmer weather! We will try another AI some day, but for now, we will stick with the cruiseships!", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cNice Place...great staff and service, great location and beach.\u201d", "Author": "CDLVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR103409269", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya the week of April 1-8. We chose the RPRM for its beach, easy access to PDC and its apparently high ranking. Generally, this is what we thought of our trip to the RPRM: Pros: Sunwing Vacations = Pleasantly surprised RPRM staff = always friendly and always helpful. Service was very good. Grounds and buildings = Very nice and well kept. Not a fan of the architecture or design, but that\u2019s a very personal preference. Beach = Incredible\u2026reason for choosing this resort/area. Lots of loungers to use and never had a problem finding a spot no matter what time we arrived at the beach. Ala Cartes = very good food and service. Best was Chillis Steak house and the staff there. Great food and great service. Location = Playacar is very nice and the walk along the beach into PDC is 15-20 minutes. Cons: Room Service = Breakfast is limited to continental and has to be pre ordered the night before. Lame. Munchies room service menu is very limited. Overall, the offerings for room service at the RPRM is far below the standard that the rest of the resort has set. Buffets = Average, but good. Expected more given the quality of the ala cartes. Food at 24 hr Sports bar = kept in fridge and then you microwaved it. Blech. Internet = None in the rooms\u2026had to go to the lobby area to use the free wi-fi. Signal strength was very good and was easy to hook up to but could be quite slow. Beds = Horribly lumpy and the plastic \u201cpee sheet\u201d used is gross. Worst part of staying here was trying to sleep in that bed. Worst bed Ive \u201cslept\u201d in by far. Losers playing the towel game at the pool. Disheartening to see so many prime loungers being saved for 6 hours and not being used. Not the resorts fault at all, but I have never seen so many strollers and newborns while on a beach vacation. Never! Too many times the baby screaming was beyond annoying and you seemingly couldn\u2019t get away from them. Opposite end of the \u201cspring beakers\u201d? LOL. Despite my reservations, I booked our trip using Sunwing Vacations for the first time. I was more than pleasantly surprised by the service of the Sunwing staff\u2026.the flights were on time both arriving and departing, they used quite modern 737-800\u2019s, and the in flight crew were very nice. A nice touch was that our return flight crew were Mexican! Made the transition back less abrupt to still be speaking Spanish on the flight. Food wasn\u2019t good, but what airline\u2019s food is? The on-site rep was very friendly and helpful even though I didn\u2019t book any excursions through her. Only downside was it was a long ride to the resort via the provided transfer, with one stop before the resort (about 1.25 hours total travel time)\u2026Id take a private transfer next time. That way you can also avoid the dolts who cant seem to figure out how to get to the transfer before having 3 beers at the bar outside the airport, thereby delaying your travel by another \u00bd hour. A couple days before we arrived, we emailed ahead of time making a general room request, and had put that in our booking reservation as well, for an upper floor unit. We had also requested a restaurant reservation for the night we arrived. Check in was easy, front desk staff was nice, and we were on our way to our room. Room 0032\u2026yuck. Ground floor, facing the Viva Wyndham Azteca, and overlooking a large manhole cover directly in front of our patio . So much for the room request. Our restaurant reservation did go through and we were at the late sitting of the Brazillian steak house. The server was very friendly and very nice as well. Food was very good and we enjoyed the style of service there. Room After dinner, we put in a request to the front desk for a room change. We were told to come back the next day to see if it could be accommodated. We came back the next day and they had changed our room for us\u2026to 2036. A nice top floor unit very close to the beach with a decent ocean view. Very nice. With the upper floor unit, it was a bit drier as well. Room 0032 was musty as all get out. I just unpacked my luggage this am and I can still smell room 0032 on my clothes. Yuck. Room had only the basic of supplies\u2026shampoo, soap, towels. Glad I decided at the last minute to pack my razor and toothpaste. Mini bar was stocked well with tequila, vodka, rum and bourbon. Dos xx was in the fridge, along with water, mirinda, pepsi and club soda. No robes or slippers. An added benefit of this room change was that we met the nicest and friendliest housekeeper ever\u2026.helpful, always willing to chat us up, and cleaned the room nicely. I think hes being wasted in a housekeeping position\u2026but maybe they start people off in housekeeping? I never ever remember our housekeepers name, but I remember his. Great guy. Restaurants We had reserved Chilis, Botafogo and Krystal, and all were nice. The surf and turf at Chilis, specifically the filet, was awesome. The baked alasaka presentation was quite the show. Krystal was weird, but the filet was very good there as well (not as good as chilis). If I were to do the ala cartes there again, I would go to Chilis every night and Botafogo a couple times to break it up. Bottle service of decent wines is provided. Had a nice Chilean cab sauv at Krystal and it worked quite well with the filet. Buffets Both Don Manolo and Chilis were decent buffets. One evening at Don Manolo\u2019s it was Asian night and that was the night for the grilled lobster tails, while on seafood night there was hardly any seafood? Weird. But for dinner Don Manolos has bottle service which is nice. Food is generally pretty good, but with generally the same offerings. The carving station would mix it up a bit. Chilis for lunch is the best for location, as youre in an open air restaurant on the beach. Food is ok, but service is great. One instance sticks out\u2026I had gone for another round and came back to my table finding it had been bussed. The place was totally packed and so they were trying to maintain a good turnover. When I sat down, the nice lady that had been serving me noticed that my table had been bussed, so she went without asking and brought me the same drink I had previously. Service here is good! The Beach. Cut to the chase\u2026this is why people come here\u2026it is gorgeous. Some remnants of the sand whales are still out there, but otherwise its perfect. The beach restoration has more than doubled the depth of the beach and it helps a ton. Half of the beach area is covered in palm trees for shade loving folks, and the other half is wide open for the people who want to bake in the sun. We didn\u2019t find it a problem getting loungers in the shaded area. Although lots of people did \u201creserve\u201d seating in there I do think that it is unnecessary. Lots of \u201creserved\u201d loungers sat there all day never being used. So we most definitely grabbed stuff from those reserving\u2026.like tables, chairs, etc. I have zero problem doing that and others should too. Beach service could be slow at times, but the guys slinging drinks out there did their best and were very friendly. Pool. The pool situation was a disappointment with only one pool where all the chairs were \u201creserved\u201d by 8am. Good thing Im not a pool person. Evenings. We were somewhat disappointed by the evenings here. Seems to really wind down after late dinner, with hardly anyone around after 11pm. Maybe it was just the week we were there, but we felt that it was definitely on the quiet side for a resort. Overall, the RPRM is a very nice resort in a beautiful location. Good food at the ala cartes, decent buffets, fantastic beach, great service and great staff all around. Somewhat disappointed in some aspects, but overall a nice place. Would I go here again\u2026.no. I think if we were to try another Riu wed go to the Riu Palace Mexico just down the beach.

We love the all inclusive style, amenities like the sailboats, and their services and workers are fantastic. We had never stayed at a Palace RIU before, and this one was top notch. It was my birthday and because I had signed up for a RIU member card last trip, they gave me champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries with a birthday card in our room. Rosario, the best steak house manager, hooked me up with a song and a mousse birthday cake. It was very special and these extra little touches are what we love about the RIU. They try really hard to make your stay memorable and fun. The infinity pool here was great, the swim up pool bar was a blast with Santos providing excellent service and great laughs. And this has to be one of the best beaches I have ever been to. White powder clean sand, all shades of blue and green clear water. You can sit on the beach and look out at Cozumel. And at the Palace we loved the beach drink service. One day a worker came around with a variety of drinks to choose from. That was a nice touch. They have hammocks under palm trees on the beach, nightly entertainment and a variety of activities during the day. Staying at the Palace we were able to go to all the other RIUs, which we have done before, so we enjoyed roaming around. All of these hotels in the Playacar district are safe and secure with a security check in for all vehicles. You can be safe going to Playa Del Carmen downtown too, either walk the private road because the Palace was closer than we thought, or take a short cheap cab ride. Great for souvenirs, fun restaurants, and shopping. We love Playa Del Carmen and the RIU Palace is really grand. The food was better than expected and you must try the specialty restaurants: Steakhouse, Mexican, and Japanese, delicious! The fruit, esp. the pineapple for breakfast is the best we have tasted. I love their mojitos as well. We stayed at the Yucatan last year and loved it too, and it's a little more lively, this was a tad stuffy and quiet but absolutely beautiful. Workers are constantly cleaning the grounds. Very impressive and we would absolutely go back. We've been to Mexico 3 times in 4 years and just love it. We feel safe and know this area thrives on tourism. We took a snorkel trip to cenotes and sea turtle cove and also felt safe with a great tour guide. That was a great trip!

We read a few bad reviews about the resort, but we had read a few bad reviews about the RIU in Jamaica and were very satisfied there, so we didn't give them much creedence. We were wrong. First, the hotel has horrible acoustics. Someone walking down the hallway in flip flops sounds like they are an elephant in pumps. A whisper sounds like a shout. The doors slam shut, and this goes on all day and all night. Don't plan on getting any sleep. Not even a few hours. We were so exhausted we slept for 12 hours our first night back home. Second, the room smelled like mold and there was mold in the shower. They only gave us two towels and one washcloth; that's fine if it's for one person but as a female with long hair I need 2 towels. We had to tip the housekeeper every day and ask for more towels and water otherwise we didn't get any. The room was constantly damp as well. Third...the worst. On day three, about 70 high school students with chaperones showed up. Now, I was young once and remember the fun I had on trips so I usually don't mind the \"fun\" that spring breakers bring, but this was out of hand. The chaperones were so busy drinking themselves that they didn't pay any mind to the crazy drunk behavior of the teens they were supposed to watch. The 70 teens piled into the pool and spent the next three days drinking and screaming and fighting (of course never getting out of the pool the use the bathroom so where do you think they urinared???), and then spent the wee hours of the mornings running up and down the hallways screaming and banging on doors. They trashed the pool area and were rude to the hotel guests. The hotel staff did nothing to address this behavior and did a very poor job of cleaning up after them for a five star hotel.

Seriously- don't come here during spring break! lesson learned. I can't blame a teenager for being loud and getting wasted but I saw of the worst behavior from adults. They wouldn't watch where they're going and one woman even ducked under a waiter that had a massive tray of dishes on one hand!

Lots of variety and it was very good. Ate one night at the Brazilian ala carte, which was good. Wanted to try the Chilis and Agave but just never made it to the lobby at the designated time to get reservations. Used the recommended tour group (TrafficTour) and Dala was a great help! He helped us book a couple of excursions (FatCat catamaran and Xplor) and was fun to work with. Once we made it to our (final) room, we found it to be comfortable. We asked to be closer to the beach/pool so while we had to walk the length of the hotel to eat, we were close to our room while spending the day at the pool so we were able to use our own w/c and it wasn't an issue to run up to something from our room. The hallways were noisy but found that earplugs were very helpful. Make sure you pack some! Did not have any issues with bugs in our room nor was our room smelly. Went out to Coco Bongo's ... what a trip! Make sure you check it out and it's definately worth spending the money to go VIP there! Only one complaint: I managed to get sick and while I was trapped in my room the maid came in to clean. I witnessed her take the glasses in the bathroom and rinse them in the sink then use the towel she had been cleaning with to wipe them. I think I know how I got sick! You cannot drink the water in the room so brushing your teeth with bottled water is somewhat challenging. I used the glass provided by the hotel. Big mistake. I wish I would have packed a couple of plastic toss-away cups! I am glad that we chose this hotel and loved loved loved the location. Beach was great, ocean was beautiful.

We stayed at the resort with an intimate group of friends and family, and we were all more than pleased with the service, accommodations, and the resort overall. First, as a bride who initially fretted about working with a wedding coordinator in another country (and via email), if, god forbid, I ever had to do it again, I would have no hesitation with working with Ms. Nancy Hernandez. Everything was beautiful, flawless, and perfect; I could not have asked for a more accommodating coordinator. Everything I requested was met. It went smoothly. There was practically no effort on my end; I was presented with options via email, my husband and I chose what we wanted, and then, for clarification, we met with Nancy a few days before the wedding. Everything went as planned and was better than I ever could imagine. We had cocktails and appetizers in the Lirico Lounge, and Santos took extra special care of us. Our dinner was at Chili's, and our 2 waiters doted on us, hand and foot. Every intricate detail was taken care of. My husband and I were practically walking on air! I think our guests also had a phenomenal time. Also included in the package were room upgrades, a couple's massage, wedding cake, bouquet, minister, etc. P.S. The wedding cake, which was chocolate cake with strawberry filling and white icing, was sooooo rich, fresh, and delicious. They even delivered our flower arrangements (included) and cake up to our room the next morning! We also went during the \"high season,\" and during spring break. Yes, the resort does discourage spring breakers, but since many people have the time off in the States, naturally people take advantage of a warm place like Mexico, so it was probably busier. With that being said, we were not able to take advantage of all of the specialty a la carte restaurants. You have to make reservations between 12-3, and you are definitely better off making reservations a couple of days in advance because spots fill up quickly...especially during the high season. If you cannot get a restaurant, you are still taken care of by an exceptional wait staff at Don Manolo's, the buffet. The choices are endless, and they do feature new items nightly. The wait staff effortlessly made sure our glasses were always full and our needs met between trips to the delicious buffet and whilst eating. The food was plentiful, rich, and tasty. Every time we ordered room service, it was delivered in a timely manner. My friends and I enjoyed going to Chili's for the lunch buffet. A woman named Gina will take exceptionally good care of you! Drinks were also plentiful. One thing I would recommend is bringing a mug or some sort of cup because the ones they offer are tiny....but they will fill up your mug all the way to the top. Islas was our favorite bartender; the espresso martinis and pina coladas were my favorites...as well as a plethora of shots of Don Julio and hot sauce. :) Because of our wedding package, we had an automatic upgrade (based on availability) to a room with an ocean view. The view was gorgeous. We did not have any complaints of our room, and we found our bed to be comfortable. We also found the resort to be very clean; I did not even see a gecko, and I had a friend tell me that they were everywhere! Unfortunately, wifi is only free in the lobby, but there is a sports bar where they have internet usage for a cost, which I am not sure what it was....I was having a little too much fun than having to be on a computer all day. ;) Most importantly, the staff was simply exceptional. They seemed to \"know\" us right after we checked in. Some even called us by name, and they have great senses of humor. We immediately felt comfortable with all of the staff. Every request we had, it was met instantly. The beach was a bit crowded, but I am not one who enjoys laying out all day either, so if I didn't get a lounge chair the second I was looking for one, it wasn't a big deal. They do open up. It was fun to go running on the beach; the sand was smooth, the turquoise waters were warm, and we even had fun night swimming on a few of the nights. The location of the resort is only about a 10-15 minute walk from 5th Avenue and the ferry to Cozumel. If you walk on the beach, it seems like the walk is even faster. And the shows were pretty entertaining, but a lot of shows in Mexico are similar. They have activities throughout the day as well, for both adults and children. I would definitely go back to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. Not only did we have a wonderful experience, but we made memories that we will cherish forever.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cRoaches, Stay Away!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Ilovekoalas", "ReviewID": "UR101684501", "Content": "My husband and myself will not be returning to a Riu ever in our life time...We purchased this trip and my husband wanted to see Beautiful Mexico for the first time!!!

Now the bad: The restaurant situation is rediculous. They advertise that they have 5... 5 star restaurants... Yeah.. If you are lucky enough to get into one... You basically have to be in the lobby every day from noon to 3 to make sure you get a spot... First of all.. Who wants to wait in line in the middle of the day to get a spot in an all inclusive restaurant?? Secondly... The restaurants seat about 30 people... It is just false advertising.. It's kind of like saying WE HAVE 5 RESTAURANTS.. If you can stand on your head for five minutes and balance a ball on your nose... We ended up paying people off to get into the Restaurants...

The hotel is great, the location couldn't be better and as for the staff - Christina, Alex, Rosario to name but a few where a credit to the hotel. The beach is a gem, we don't bother with the pool - what's the point of sitting around the pool - you could be anywhere. The beach is lovely to walk along and only takes 10 minutes until you are in 5th Avenue. Walking the beach one day we saw a stingray and a turtle. Loads and loads of sunloungers. Alex would even bring drinks down to the beach. The entertainment staff worked hard always something going on if you wanted to get involved - I did try the coconut cocktails. A must. Walking around outside the hotel is great we did venture into the other Riu's - wouldn't give you tuppence for the Tequilla - lager louts and real bad atmostphere. The mexican was nice and we did eat there a couple of lunchtimes and have a few drinks there of an evening. The rooms itself were spotless we had asked for a quiet room and that's what we were given. There are optics in the room - vodka, brandy, whiskey and bacardi aswell as alcohol and soft drinks in the mini fridge. The food in the buffet restaurant is immense and we really enjoyed the ice and the fruit/vegetable sculptures. We did eat twice in the Steakhouse - Rosario is the manager here - I must say the steak here is the best my husband and I have tasted so good that we just had to go back. We tried the Brazillian - very good and also the Mexican twice again very good. We did the trip to Chitzenitza be warned it is a very tiring day but boy was it worth it. The Mayan ruins are immense and not what we were expecting at all. A great day out and a fantastic guide -Rex. In all I can't fault this hotel but then a holiday is only what you make it.

We were a group of two couples, with no children along. We had booked our stay at the Riu Tequila. When we arrived on Saturday night at 11pm, we were told we were being upgraded to the Palace. The hotel staff put us in taxi's, paid the fare, and transfered us to the Riu Palace Rivier Maya, which was about 1/2 mile down the road. Needless the say, this was quite an upgrade! While I'm sure we would have enjoyed our stay at the Tequila, the Palace was luxurious in comparison. Entering the lobby we first noticed all the crystal chandaliers, and the stained glass design above the largest chandlier. Beautiful. Our room was very comfortable, 2 double beds pushed together, with a step down area where there was a loveseat and coffee table facing the television. Our deck overlooked the tennis courts, and the hotel next door. We had a refrigerator in our room, as well as a coffee maker, and liquor dispenser. The bathroom was spacious and had a jetted bathtub. Our friends were initially offered a room that smelled very smokey. They were then given a different room that was laid out similar to ours. My husband and I have stayed at other all inclusive resorts in the RIviera Maya area. Granted, we had not stayed in the 5 star hotels, but they were quite nice. In comparison, the food at the Riu Palace was fabulous. Breakfast always had a cook making fresh omelets to your order. The fresh fruit was delicous. Lunch was served in Chili's restaurant overlooking the beach and ocean. Couldn't have asked for a better view. One day a chef was making Cerviche, which was a mixture of seafood, vegetables, lemon juice and topped with fresh avocado. Wow!! THe dinner buffet was fantastic, we had lobster, shrimp, beef tenderloin, paella, and more. We ate dinner in the Brazilian ala carte restaurant one night. It was very good, but we preferred the buffet where we could go eat at whatever time we wanted to, rather than at a set time. The swimming pools were sparkling clean and beautiful. The swim up bar was always a popular spot, especially on St. Patricks day. There is a grove of palm trees from the edge of the pool area to the beach where there are lots of lounge chairs. Then it is followed by a nice strip of beach with more lounge chairs. The chairs by the pool and beach did fiil up early in the morning. We put towels on chairs to reserve them after breakfast, because our first day we did not do that, and at 11, it was difficult finding 4 chairs together. The beach at Playacar is beautiful. We walked quite a ways in each direction, one day walking to Playa del Carmen, and the other day we walked in the other direction and explored all the other Riu resorts. Because we were staying at the Palace, we had access to all the Riu resorts. The staff at the Riu was extremely friendly and hard working. The waiters working around the bar area cover the pool and entire beach area for the guests and will bring drinks, and check on guests about every 15 minutes. Extraordinary service. We did leave tips for the housekeeping staff, and gave small tips to waiters and bartenders when they did a great job. One day we took an excursion to Aktun Chen. We ziplined, walked through a large cave, and swam in a cenote. Loved it. Our friends visited Coba, and they loved that as well.

The food is good and the buffet has an excellent selection. The individual restaurants are just OK, but a nice break fromt he buffet. The rooms are spotless. If you want a chair by the pool, you have to get up early and park your towel and possessions on a chair. I'm not sure the solution to this problem, but if you're not there by about 9:30 you can't sit by the pool. After the first few days, we preferred the beach, where there are plenty of chairs and shade. The beach is beautiful and not too crowded. The equipment in the exercise room is mostly non functional and should be fixed and updated. The wi fi situation is terrible. The only place to get it is in the lobby and then it is a low bandwidth that fades in and out. It's impossible to call through Skype since the internet quality is poor or, at best, average. So, it's very difficult or impossible to conduct any business through the internet. Another annoyance is the computers in the Sports Bar. They charge $3 for 15 minutes of use and charge for printing. It 's independent of the hotel and the woman who runs it doesn't take credit cards and doesn't give change. This is really ridiculous and not in keeping with the quality of the hotel. The hotel should take this over and provide a few computers for the use of their guests. If you walk along the beach, you can reach Playa del Carmen in 20 minutes. It's a lovely walk and the town is VERY touristy but nice and safe, at least during the day. I haven't been there in the evening. We walked there twice.

PDC has a ferry which you can take for world class scuba in Cozumel. 4) Cleanliness? More like spotless. My mother-in-law is a clean freak and she was totally impressed with how much they clean there. I was hard pressed to find a cobweb anywhere. 5) Food was great . Yes you might be able to find a better 5 star restaurant in some other hotel somewhere but the restaurants here are great. 6) room was very nice. A multilevel design was quite welcoming and bigger than expected. Again, spotless 7) Service was fantastic, almost got annoying how much they asked you how well you were doing or do you need something else. Went diving in the cenotes with Dive adventuras (ask for Mario who is the best in the business.) Also did diving in Cozumel with Dive with Martin which was OK. As much as I want to, I can't possibly give any constructive negative feedback from this experience. Yes i might find a better beach or better food in a mega 5 star on some atol in the maldives but not in combination and certainly not for the money. Possibly the best value on earth.

Perhaps the hotel could have more non-smoking rooms together? The dress code for hotel restaurants in the evening need to be more strictly enforced. English men should not bother packing any decent clothes with you...you will be in the minority & will be wasting your time / space in your case.. Most males from 'the Americas' staying in the hotel just wore shorts t-shirts /sandals / flip flops every evening (most looked quite scruffy & looked as though they hadn't bothered changing from a day at the beach). We saw no one turned away from restaurants / bars, despite the fact that they were fragrantly violating the dress codes signs displayed outside each one.. Gym was dated & poorly equipped & needs upgrading. Evening entertainment was bit 'hit & miss' could be better.

Our suite number was 1115 and the balcony faced the water, which we were informed that we could not see, and the courtyard. The maids kept the room spotless. The in-room bar and refrigerator were stocked daily with beer, soda, and water. The mattress was firm but, it did not stop us from getting a good night's sleep. The food was abundant and excellent. For breakfast, my favorite meal, the buffet could not have been any better. There were eggs any style, many different meats and cheeses, fruits and juices, all kinds of breads, tea and coffee, and tasty warm doughnuts. Room service was not needed. When lunch time came neither one of us were hungry but the food looked so inviting we managed to try something anyways. All lunch-time goodies were available. We had dinner at the buffet twice which was supplied with seafood such as;lobster, shrimp, clams, etc: meats; steak, pork, chicken: lots of vegetables, and many different choices for dessert. The buffet has something for everybody. Other nights we dined at the Brazilian Grill, where the food was excellent here, and Chilis. The beach had two sections. The upper beach, closest to the hotel, had palm trees which provided shade. The lower part of the beach is where we sat. There were plenty of chairs. The pool was comforting. It had its usual pool chair hogs but chairs can still be found. Something to eat or drink was always being offered or available close by. We all know shopping is within walking distance and tours are available. We chose to spend a day on the island of Cozumel. So, we took the thirty minute boat ride. TIP- remember things always cost less when you get there. We rented a scooter and off we went. About twenty minutes into our ride across the island, we had lunch at Coconuts. It was typical tourist stop. We had fun. Overall we enjoyed every minute of our vacation. We would highly recommend staying at this hotel.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Vacation- clean, safe, fun\u201d", "Author": "jimbo1904", "ReviewID": "UR100032998", "Content": "I have read a lot of reviews prior to going on this trip and was a little concerned about some of the negative reviews.

Definately a 5* hotel in a brilliant resort (I do not understand why anyone would speak poorly about it!) My boyfriend and I stayed here from Feb 20th - Mar 6. (We have just come home - very sad) We had a wonderful time! Greeted really pleasantly at the reception (no issues wit Xavier - he was very helpful!) and all the staff were friendly and helpful! Had a Junior Suite, which had a step down living area and made it feel very luxurious with a huge walk in wardrobe, massive bathroom (2 sinks and big bath and great shower) Room cleaned every day - yes they were always cleaning everywhere!! You cant say this isnt a clean hotel! And yes there was a slight smell of \"sick\" on the stairs leading to the coutyard from lobby - but I think it could only be the cleaning fluid as there never was any sick and it wasn't every day. Pools were great (little dirty from time to time - mainly coming from the pool bar - which was always busy!) You do have to get up at crack of dawn to get a sunbed which is just pathetic, however i prefered the beach as it was less noisy and had a lovely sea breeze. Beach beautiful white sand, sea (when not toooo choppy as it was on occasions) was beautiful clear, crystal turquoise in colour. And even some friendly large fish graced our presence on those days! Food was plentiful! Lots of fried, lots of salad, cheese, ham, fruits, pizzas, pastas, fish, steak, meats, etc etc etc! No one could go hungary! Not a single person should have the cheek to complain about the food here! The A La Carte restaurants were brilliant! Our favs being KRYSTAL and the JAPENESE. They were divine. Chilli's as a STEAKHOUSE at night was great too, and the MEXICAN and BRAZILLIAN were fine also, but starters were buffet which i was a bit sad about. However, the buffet restaurant was brilliant also!!! Plenty to choose from, themed nights but still had all the usual stuff, who has lobster at a buffet!! Yes they do!! Tipping we didnt feel we had to do - we tipped occasionally - 20 Peso's here and there. Every other day in the room, The waiters treated us impeccibly even without constantly tipping! CHAMPAGNE all the way - yes it is probably sparkling wine, but so is Champagne - just gets that title because of where its from. Go down the cocktail list, have as many drinks as you like, the waiters are more than happy to please :D Resort was great - about 5 mins away left of hotel is a Plaza with stools and shops, silver, drug stores, clothes, lots of silver! but barter, barter, barter with the silver. Its all done by weight and they want to make a sale at the end of the day so would take a big cut! This goes the same with the shops in Playa Del Carmen, 5th Avenue. They all sell the same things so keep looking round before buying something straight away - you may find it at a much better price! 5th Avenue was a 20 min walk along fancy villas/houses of Playacar (the complex that the hotels are situated in) Beautiful walk and even came across ruins!!!! Book the tours through the company at the Plaza - they're great and soooooooo much cheaper than your travel agent! We got 2 trips for the same price as 1 of the ones Thomson were offering - and they were the same trips!

Some tips also\u201d", "Author": "kay2four", "ReviewID": "UR98705296", "Content": "This was our 5th time staying in an All-inclusive resort. 1st 5+ star, and the nicest place we've been to. One of the nicer features of the hotel was its location. It was about 50 minutes from the airport with only one stop right next door to us. The riu is on a nice deep beach in a gated community called Plyacar. Its rather large as there are maybe a dozen big resorts and many homes and a golf course within the walls. Also a small shopping area a 5 minute walk from the riu within Playacar. Playacar is directly south of Playa Del Carmen and you can walk the sidewalk right to 10 ave (one block from 5th), which is the walking area with all the shops in playa. Also the beaches in Mexico are all public so you can walk to playa on the beach the entire way. (probably 20 minutes). The first thing I noticed at the riu was the amount of staff. They wait on you constantly. There are at least 5 or 6 girls cleaning the lobby and straightening the lobby every morning. People keeping the food restocked and cleaning up after the guests at the buffets etc, Yard workers, waiters...You'll see. The palaces are the nicest of the riu's as we went to most of the others and this was easily the nicest. Rooms were all mini-suites and very clean and comfortable. I liked the fact that the safe was large enough for ny laptop to fit. A couple tips: Beware as the timeshare sellers and some merchants are pretty aggresive at trying to get your business. Its still a shopping experience worth doing. We did a timeshare at the occidental, and it wasn't even close. Don't bother to exchange dollars for pesos as they wont exchange back for you when you leave. Most everyone takes dollars (12.3 to 1 at the time) but some give 11 or even 10 to 1. All give back pesos in change. So take like twewnty's as its hard to get us change for hundreds. There is a Walmart in Playa and they give the 12 to 1 . There is really no snorkelling at the riu beach as it is all sand and you need reef for fish. you can book good trips for that. We were there when there was 97% capacity and got chairs by the pool early the first day, and found it really wasn't necessary. As long as you weren't waiting till like 10 or 10:30 there were chairs either on the beach or by the pools. Ok the food: Im not a buffet guy, but breakfast is always a good buffet. They had an omelet station every day, and the usual stuff. I thought their bacon was excellent. Lunch....... we ate either at chilis (the buffet by the pool which had more burgers and dogs) or the main buffet. (which had the better ice cream). Was ok. Always can find something . Dinners...... We only ate at the buffet 2 nights as I much prefer sit down. The japanese I would call good. The Brazilian I would call ok. The Mexican was ok to good. We didn't eat at the fusion. Chili's was the best so we ate there twice and would have again but there was a wedding there our last night. The reservations worked like this: Someone was in the lobby bar area daily noon to three, Each day you can book dinner for that day and the next two. But you can only book two each day. Each day when you get there that day is booked up in all the restaurants, so you book the following 2 days. We never had an issue as we were always booking the following day or two. For example we arrived on sunday and sunday all were booked, so we booked mon and tues wherever we wanted. on monday we booked wed. etc. Also if you really want a specific place and its booked we were told to arrive on time (there are 2 seatings) and let them know and in a few minutes someone always no-shows and they will seat you . We found the nightly shows to be ok(not the best) but was worth doing. A bit surprising was when they allowed vendors to set up in the courtyard (almost nightly) they were rather pushy also.

You can check out my other reviews. This place set a new standard. Location: I've always been a fan of Playa Del Carmen. Fifth Avenue is a shopping and tourist's delight. Anytime you can stay withing walking distance of town, it's a definite bonus. The Riu Palace was an easy 20 minute walk up the beach to get into the heart of town. Beach: Beautiful beach. Lots of palm trees providing natural shade. Pure, soft, white sand and crystal clear water. Resort: Top notch. Very classy. Very elegant. Very clean. Service: Here's where this place really excels. Mexican resorts are known for their great service. (As opposed to Jamaica, where they take the phrase \"No problem\" as little too seriously). But this place was awesome. I had a problem with my coffee maker in my room. It almost felt like they were knocking on my door with a solution before I could even put my phone back in the cradle. In fact, when the gentleman from the front desk realized I had a problem, and he could see that sincere look of coffee-need in my eyes, he had room service deliver up coffee without even asking if that would make me happy. He just knew. I could go on and on with more examples of the great staff there. Clearly, the management is superb. Room: Great beds. Mexican resorts are known for their firm beds. You'll see many complaints of the hardness of the beds on these sites. If you like soft beds, good like finding them in Mexico. As good fortune would have it, I like a firm bed. Slept like a baby. Only complaint with the room was that the TV was way off to the side from the beds. They had a nice little sitting area in front of the TV. But it was nearly impossible to watch TV from bed. A lot of people like to wind down in front of the TV before going to bed. Hard to do here. Bathroom was clean. Jetted tub was a nice touch. I've read some complain about the noisiness in the halls. This is somewhat true here, but is somewhat true at most resort in Mexico. Here the tip: you're at one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Don't stay in your room anymore than you have to! Pool: Adequate pool. Most places like this have a swim up pool bar. For most this means a couple of submerged \"bar stools\". Here, it's an entire area with little \"booths\". They have re-defined the swim-up pool bar. Food: OK. Before I go any further, I must make sure that you don't think I'm being paid by the resort for this review. In the past 5 years, I've been to nearly a dozen resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean. I'm not a push-over, but I'm not hard to please either. I'm a moderate. Why am I giving this disclaimer? Because I'm getting ready to brag on the food. Many all-inclusives have a hard time getting the food right. It's typically \"OK\". I didn't have a bad meal here. The breakfast buffet was particularly outstanding. The Riu chain has a strong European influence. They had breakfasts appealing to the American, European and Mexican palette. Dinners were quite good too. I recommend making your reservations for the non-buffet restaurants as early as you can (i.e., right after you unpack). They fill up quickly. If you don't get around to that, hand around the front at dinner time with a healthy tip. That helps too. As a final note, I want to re-iterate that I am not a push-over for these places. I am fairly picky.

As others have said, the beds are hard and the linens very rough. Soundproofing of rooms was nonexistent - lots of noise from the hallway and your neighbors. Our room was nice; although the bathroom had a water leak from above and the bathroom floor was constantly soaked. We advised RIU staff several times, with no response. We then called the front desk (2x) who eventually had it addressed by RIU Maintenance. When we returned to our room after lunch, we unfortunately found that maintenance used epoxy sealant to try to seal the leak (instead of finding the source of the leak). Epoxy is hazardous to breath for at least the first 12 hours. Our room was not livable and we had to be moved to a different room. The bartenders and servers were friendly, engaging, and fun. We especially loved Islas at the Lobby Bar and Antenor (?) at the Pool Bar. The Front Desk Staff, as others have noted, is unhelpful and borderline rude. When asked directly about lunch options, they told us the only place to have lunch was Chili\u2019s at the beach. Two days into our stay, we found out the Main Buffet was open for lunch (1PM -3 PM). The lunch food there was great compared to the lunch at Chili\u2019s. Loungers around the pool were saved VERY early. We woke up at 6 AM on our last day to watch the sunrise and we encountered people already saving their spots around the pool, with many already loungers already saved. The food was overall good. We ate at the Don Manolo Buffet twice for dinner and 3x for lunch. Buffets were very good. For the Specialty restaurants, we dined at the Mexican (Appetizers good, I loved my beef entr\u00e9e, my wife did not care for her shrimp-overcooked and rubbery), the Brazilian (good overall, except the beef was overdone), the Japanese (good all around), but the Krystal Fusion was very disappointing (tried to be too creative and do too much). Nightly entertainment in the Piazza before the Show. The nightly shows were ok. There is no nightclub on-site. You have to walk about 7 minutes to the Nightclub at RIU Tequila. Note, RIU Palace does not offer a golf cart ride to/from the club (Iberostar does). With my wife in heels, we would not walk the distance. We heard that wireless internet was available in the Lobby. We took a laptop and found the internet excruciatingly slow, almost unusable. The beach was great - manicured and raked every morning, lots of sunloungers, plenty of locations for shade or sun. Overall from our experiences, the RIU Palace Riviera Maya would be on par with the Iberostar Lindo, but it is not as nice as the Iberostar Maya and certainly not the Iberostar Grand. We would stay there again if the price was right.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAwesome trip, hotel, and wedding!!!\u201d", "Author": "manda_3347", "ReviewID": "UR97708830", "Content": "We have stayed at 3 previous Riu's and we loved all of them.

Our trip started out with a damp dark room on the bottom floor facing another hotel. They were happy to upgrade us 3 times! Our stay was 15 days and our last 8 days were in a suite facing the ocean over the pool! Everytime a better room opened up they asked us if we would like to change rooms! The food was better then I could imagine, and everyone was super nice. The pool boys brought us two drinks at time and knew us by name. The maids made us dinosours, swans and elephants out of our towels and spare blankets. The shows at night are cheezy but fun, the night market is a little anoying and way over priced. The only lame thing was our wedding planner was all over the place, I had to call her half hour before the wedding to find out what was going on, she seemed curious as to why i had called. She also forgot to tell us we need blood tests, which we knew we did but read online a doctor would come to our room. We ended up waiting in a group of couples in an upstairs bar above the lobby in RIU palace mexico. Not very personal but whatever. We also did not recieve a wedding gift, which was part of the wedding package. The spa was also a total rip off, way more then I would ever have pay at home and half as good. I had to laugh at makeup it was so bad! My hair was ok and my mani/pedi looked good but don't expect anything but bare minimum attention to you for top dollar. I do makeup professionaly so i fixed myself up no problem but i didn't want to have to do my own face on my wedding day. They had one girl to do all of the above so, there's the problem right there. They over charged us as well so watch out for that!!. The Spa I believe is NOT actually part of the RIU hotel so it is no blame to them at all. The photographer we had was super hands on and really friendly and cool. His name is Carlos and if you get him your in luck! he made us feel really comfortable and even gave us a ride back to our hotel later on! his pictures were great and he made us laugh the whole time!! Joe the bartender was our man, he was even in one of our wedding pics!

The Buffet is top-notch, serving great food in the morning and evening. We enjoyed unlimited lobster tails the evening we arrived--impressive to say the least. We have travelled extensively throughout the world as well as several Cruise ships having said that our expectations are somewhat high.

The Hotel was spectacular! There was alot for us to do and the hotel staffs were super friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the staffs at the front desk. It's amazing how you are staying in a 6 star hotel and have the rudest front desk people assist you. Some advice for those of you who are traveling to this location. 1) Try to convert your dollars into small pesos, this is good for taxi rides into town, phone calls to the spa or tips you are planning to give to any hotel staff. The front desk will not give you change and their conversion rate is not in your favor. Or just bring small dollar bills, $5's and $1's are ideal. 2) Since it is all inclusive and upon checking in, the front desk will not tell you that you will need to make dinner reservations in advance. The buffet serves great food and have a different theme to offer you each night. But if you would rather have a quiet dinner, these reservations are needed to make days in advance and the host would only be in the lobby from 12pm-3pm. By 230pm if there is no one in line to make reservation, she will leave early. Reservations are needed to made in person, you can not call and the front desk don't have a contact number for her. 3) If for any reason you would like to leave the hotel to get into town, go on any tour, or have any questions, the staff at the front door will quickly get you a taxi, or the tour guides in the lobby would give you the best answers to any of your questions, accurately and more politely than the front desk. 4) There is no emergency center in the hotel, please check for the closest doctor in case of an emergency. However there is a pharmacy in that location, but the front desk will not have that number for you. You will need to leave the hotel and go to the bottom lobby to access the pharmacy. 5) The gym equipments are outdated and some of them don't work. But the weather and the location of the hotel was nice for us for our morning jog. Overall our family had a great trip. The hotel is clean and the people are always smiling and friendly. If you do not need assistant from the front desk, just don't use them, they will just upset you.We will travel to this location again but would not stay in this hotel.

The Hotel is a lovely building, as some say based on an Indian theme, inside very opulent, chandeliers etc. It is very clean and well maintained, staff continually cleaning, no tummy problems during our stay. The best rooms look out on The Plaza, we were informed on Reception that Thomson rooms, who we travelled with, only had the back rooms, which was initially a bit of a disappointment, although after speaking to other guests, some of the rooms can be noisy at night, not with the onsight entertainment which finishes at 11 p.m. but noisy revellers coming in at 4 a.m. after the nightly excursion to Cancun, our room was very quiet and for the amount of time we spent in there was adequate. I think the outstanding thing about this Hotel has to be the staff, they are so friendly and cannot do enough for you, not always expecting tips, although when you realize how low their wages are, a few dollars or pesos are very welcome. We loved the beach plenty of loungers under the shade of the palms, a bit noisy for us round the pool, but everyone there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the fact you could have a nice long walk in both directions, about 20 mins along the beach to Playa del Carmen, very touristy but worth a visit, if you like shops. They also run the ferry to Cozamul which again is worth a visit if you haven't been. In the other direction you can get past the Hotels and walk with just the forest on one side and the ocean to cool your feet, beautiful ! The food is great, something for everyone, tried a couple of speciality restaurants, very nice, but the buffet has so much to choose from we were happy with that. I would mention here we were very surprised with the mode of dress in the Restaurants, shorts and very casual ware in the evenings, not usual at a 5 star hotel, so whatever you pack you will not look out of place. The evening entertainment was also very good, usually the chance to dance to some good groups if you wanted followed by a show different theme each night. The selection of drinks was very good, the cocktails were well presented. If you are a Gin and Tonic drinker, this is not standard in the rooms, think more geared to U.S tastes, but you can ask for it at Reception and it will be delivered. The verdict, a good Hotel in an idealic location if you stay at this Riu you can visit and use the facilities of the other Riu hotels in the area, nice to walk out for a drink, this option only for guest at this one, guest staying at the other hotels in this group cannot use the Palace Riviera Maya facilities.

We hired a cab service to take us from the airport in Cancun to Playa del Carmen, which took about an hour. The hotel's location is very secure - within a gated, guarded 'neighborhood' with both homes and resort/hotels. We were very pleased with the security of the area, given Mexico's recent reputation for civil unrest. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by a grandiose, two-story lobby with a bar and various seating areas. The desk staff explained in detail how the \"all inclusive\" features, including the on-site restaurants/dining options, and use of pools at all Riu locations worked. The rooms are located on un-conditioned, open-air corridors, which, due to the climate, suffer from extreme humidity, which is evident in the peeling of paint and buckling of framed artwork. Our room was very spacious, with a nice sitting area and large TV and the bathroom was large. However, the room was clearly either a smoking room or had been at some point - the smell was so strong it permeated everything in our luggage and stung my nose. The bath/shower smelled strongly of mold. While I am sure that everything was very clean - as evidenced by the efficient daily cleaning staff - the smells were unappealing, at best. Our view was the back of some condos, which wasn't so great. There is a nice variety of places to eat on the premises, although, don't expect anything truly mind-blowing in the way of cuisine. The beachside buffet restaurant was best for breakfast and lunch - second would probably be the buffet in the main hotel. The sit-down, reservation-only restaurants were fine, but we actually hit up the late-night buffet afterwards to satiate our hunger! With the all-inclusive package, there are unlimited drinks at any of the restaurants or bars. We didn't ever use the liquor dispensers in the room, but there are at least three varietals available in the room, with a mini-bar that is fully stocked. We did enjoy just having the bottled water and sodas in the room. Most of the mixed drinks were overly sugary, syrupy and just OK. Stick with the beer if you're going to drink. The best part of this place is the beach. There are plenty of seating options - around the pool, in the shade of palm trees in the sun, nearer the water without shade ... we mostly spent time in the shade - the breezes were nice and the chairs were comfy. Overall, we had the best relaxation outside of the hotel. We tried not to spend much time at all in the rooms - while air-conditioned, they were just so humid and smelly, it was hard to sleep. I'd recommend this hotel for vacationing families with teens (no small children), college students, or twenty-something friends. It's not the place for romantic getaways or small children. Overall, I would say that it was a fine experience for my first trip to Mexico, but I would probably choose a bit smaller, more upscale place for my next trip.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cHeaven!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "luvtotravel09", "ReviewID": "UR96727769", "Content": "Just back from a week in Heaven!

Overall: WOW and WOW. My wife and two other couples from NYC area decided that we will spend a little more and try a higher rated resort to celebrate a friend\u2019s 50th birthday. So a travel agent friend recommended Riu Palace. It blew us all away. They really know how to provide a best vacation you've ever had. There are some things I/we love-to-have and hate-to-have on these types of trips, so here is my list you can compare to your likes. No resort is perfect, but this one had all that I/we loved. Grounds: Once inside the U shaped garden-like grounds it seems compact and cozy like the European palace garden, but did not feel crowed with people. Lawn is perfectly maintained and picturesque. You could eat off the clean tiled walkways. At night the lighting made the place even more pleasing with a gazebo in the middle and French street caf\u00e9 tables to sit and have a sip of coffee or a cocktail or a cigar. Food: I hate waiting on lines \u2013 there were none even in the buffet. They said the resort was full, but you\u2019d never know it. A few decent restaurants, \u201cKrystal\u201d fusion restaurant was on a level of a Manhattan restaurant and I do cook myself and my son is a chef. Skip the Japanese if you know what sushi is supposed to taste like. But the best part of it was you did not even need to leave the buffet. Not only that they have a great choice and quality you can sit in a beautiful indoor dining room or on an outdoor patio under an overhang with white tablecloths and Paris street caf\u00e9 feel-like atmosphere \u2026 AND NO CROWDS no waiting on lines. One night they had a trumpet player in a gazebo play soft music while we dined on a buffet patio. It was so romantic women loved it. Lunch buffet at Chili\u2019s had enough to choose from for everyone. Activities: Snorkeling is right there, after which I tried their free scuba lesson in the pool and then went to scuba the reef nearby. They had pool and beach volleyball every day and a few other activities that we did not get to just wanted to get some leisure time on the beach. Room: The beds could be a little more comfortable, but OK. Room is clean and well maintained; nothing to write home about and you should not stay in it too long anyway. Pool: If you like to sit by the pool in a prime spot, you may need to come out early and place a towel on it. I would not know about it. Beach: Sit on a beautiful, clean beach with palm trees and soft shade they cast. Plenty of lounge chairs for all to bask on the sun. No bugs or mosquitoes anywhere. That\u2019s what heaven must feel like. One morning I saw many coconuts on the ground on the beach that seemed fallen off the trees, which seemed odd. They actually cut them off. Next thing I know they brought them to the beach barbeque area and chopped the tops off and make drinks in them to hand out. Nice touch! Staff: The staff is GREAT and does not make you feel that you owe them a tip for every drink they bring you, though I wanted to tip everyone as I was treated like a royalty. They just let you do whatever you want and when you want it. Surroundings: Close enough to walk to some local shopping. Many other hotels and resorts right there and most are RIU brands which you can use with Palace hand band because it\u2019s higher level than the others. Misc: Drinks are good and plenty. Lobby had WIFI, but a weak signal. You can still use your smart phone or laptop for minor activities, though after a first day will not want to. Close to parks like Xel-H\u00e1. We did them last trip there, but it\u2019s a good outing to try. I have left out few other minor amenities, but you\u2019ll need to discover them for yourselves. Kind of makes you think why don\u2019t other resorts do that?

A bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries were sent to our room a few days later apologizing for the inconvenience. The rooms: The rooms were very nice, bright and clean, refreshed every day with clean sheets and towels. Good temperature and pressure in the shower. The bar fridge was stocked every day with pop, water and beer. The balcony was huge and it was very nice to open the patio door in the am to let the warm breeze into the room while getting ready for breakfast. The Restaurant: By far the best food I\u2019ve ever had at an all inclusive resort. From breakfast to dinner, the a la carte restaurants to the buffet, the service to the variety of wine, the freshness of the seafood to the quality of the meet all was sublime. We ALWAYS found something to eat and felt satisfied. The only thing I can complain about was the fact that we had to leave the pool area in order to go make reservations in the main lobby. This was only possible between noon and two. I found that to be an inconvenience but when we sat at dinner and receive the level of attention and service that we did, this was all worth it.

We especially enjoyed the Brazalian steakhouse. There was an amazing breakfast buffet every morning, we usually skipped lunch, but there was a lot of food available all day.

Well, we were upgraded to this hotel from the Tequila ( long story) but now wondering if we should of just stayed at our original hotel we booked. We stayed on first floor room 121. The Good: Front desk seemed attentive, friendly --fast check in process Waiters worked very hard to please the customers Grounds just beautiful, Beach was Amazing, Palm trees in abundance for shade Lots of chairs available on beach Standard room size nice, sitting area with small couch, balcony Mini-Kids club open 2 hours am/pm--sweet ladies, kept kids entertained Lots of activities for kids--had kids show at 8:30pm each night Entertainment staff also very hard workers--the shows were good Our bathroom had big, almost sunken in bathtub ( great for my 4 year old) Decent amenities for bathroom ( shampoo dispenser by tub) Fresh flowers in room by housekeepers and towel animals ( appreciated by my little one) Wal-Mart close by ( 7 dollar cab ride)..pharmacy just walk to shopping villa by Yucatan Riu No problem getting extra pillows, extra beers in our refrig Flat screen TV ( if you want to plug in a small DVD player or something you could very easily...just need to bring your adapters). Safe was easy to use...kind of on smaller side...only would accommodate a small 'notebook' size computer Small gift store--sells power aide ( lifesaver for us) The Bad: Everything Tiled so watch out, slippery...they wash the floors constantly in the hallways etc. My husband had a sprained ankle from the beach so these wet tiles made it difficult to catch your balance Room service menu very limited...no kid meal choices. If you are sick...no popsicles/ice pops, no soup, no bananas! **Tip ( go to Wal-Mart buy what you need--small freezer could hold some ice pops) Had 2 cockroaches...not a biggie ( we are in a jungle environment) TIP** wanted to mention to close your drain stoppers in the sink and tub at night...both I found coming out of the sink in the bathroom. All seats/loungers around pool seemed to be taken by 8am The hallways are loud from 7am-8pm ...bring ear plugs. No umbrella for us to use ( the Hotel Tequila had one in guest rooms) The Ugly: We were sick 3 out of the 6 days we were there--we are guessing food poisoning. We are seasoned travelers and this has never happened to us before. Did I mention no banana's on buffet line 2 days in a row? room service said they didn't have any 2 days straight. Really? but you have them at the bar in buckets to make drinks ( realized this later) *** No hand sanitizer in public bathrooms or at entrance to buffet restaurants. Gross! Gross! Gross!

We did spray our room with Lysol ( we bought that at local Wal-Mart) ..used the whole can before we left hotel room ( hoping we didn't make anyone sick, including housekeepers). Last morning, they didn't have any water in whole hotel.

I've read a lot of reviews and everyone has done an excellent job covering the hotel. I can do a bit of a comparison. I stayed at the Riu Palace Las Americas in Cancun last time I did an all inclusive. In comparison, RP Riviera Maya is much better. The size of grounds and the vastness of the beach is so much better. I love the Playacar area in general and felt it was far superior to the Cancun strip. My wife and I aren't clubbers, so keep that in mind. The cleanliness and service were very comparable to the RP Las Americas. The Riu line does a great job with food, drinks, service, cleanliness, etc. I'm a big fan. The rooms are the same except you get an ocean view (or a chance for one) in Cancun... not possible in Playa. I'll take the gigantic beach over the oceanview rooms though. My next all inclusive trip will likely be with a different brand. Not due to any lack of satisfaction, but rather want to experience something new and different. I very much felt like the two Riu Palace resorts were very similar. Food was the same, drinks were the same, service was the same. It really speaks to the overall Riu brand since I actually loved all of those things. With that, I think it's time for change for us. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that we will visit a Riu Palace again one day. We just need a change of pace. Also, we visited the Riu Palace Mexico to compare. I prefer the Riviera Maya hotel. Everything is more spacious and layed out better. You'll love either, but I preferred the Riu Palace Riviera Maya and would highly recommend. As a quick note (if you're still reading which I doubt), the internet in the lobby/piano bar is horrendous. The upload speeds are reminiscient of dial up if not worse.

There was an extensive bar, including cava and cocktails all inclusive, available 24 hours, as was room service. In the sports bar there is also a fridge and microwave for you to help yourself to burgers, hot dogs, nachos and the like. I am quite hard to please when it comes to food as my parents own restaurants, but with 5 restaurants plus one buffet, you never felt hungry or not satisfied. The service....exceptional. Nowhere have I ever experienced such personal touches. Eating at the buffet, the waitors would fall over themselves to carry your plate back to your table, always pull your chair out for you. One night we were sat at the outside bar listening to the music from the bandstand, our table was wobbly. The waitor noticed us wobbling it, came over to check everything was ok, we said yes fine, and when he left we realised whilst he was talking to us he had slipped a bearmat under with his foot, discrete and actually bothered about making your experience better. Location...10, 15 minutes from '5th avenue' in playa del carman. Or a taxi ride the equivalent of \u00a34.

Rooms...clean, serviced everyday, every day towel art, turndown service and stocked mini bar (including liquer dispenser) One day I was gutted as I had lost a diamond earring, could've obviously been anywhere so was long gone, on my return to our room my earring AND butterfly was on the bedside table. I think goes to show how well the rooms were cleaned. The hotel itself feels very new still, everyday they were powerhosing something or touching up paint here and there (I say this as a complement...you do not feel like you are in a building site!) but you get the impression they take pride in the hotel.

A day before we were supposed to leave for Playa del Carmen the North East was hit with a huge storm. Our flights were cancelled and we would have to leave the following day. We were hoping that Expedia could just switch the dates to one day later for both our arrival and departure. However, they were not willing to do this unless we paid for the one night service fee. It turns out if you book with them directly and cannot get to the resort through no fault of your own, there will be no fee but because we booked through a third party they were not willing to work with us. Expedia even tried calling them and was hung up on twice. Eventually Expedia assumed the costs for us, but this was after a 3 hour phone call. This kind of put a bad taste in our mouth before we got there. Upon our arrival the place was magnificent. It was very grand and definitely the nicest resort out of the many we walked through in the area. I would describe the look as very ornate. When we entered our room, it was clean and with a very large bathroom, nothing to complain about there until we saw our view. We had a room looking at a wall on the outside perimeter of the hotel, looking at some construction that was partially masked. We asked for a better room and they showed us a suite with partial view of the ocean and beach for $150 more a night. I would have been happy with a view of the courtyard but they said all those rooms were taken. Eventually we settled on a standard room with the same view as the suite on the first floor. Fifty dollars more and we had a pretty decent view. Everything, was going with any more hitches. Buffets in the morning were plentiful with lots of fresh juices, fruits, pastries and the regular breakfast staples. Lunches were decent as well. And the restaurants and dinner shows were pretty on par as well. But then ---- after returning one night to our room we found a couple cockroaches. Part of me can understand this, I mean we are on the first floor and this is near to jungle like terrain we are in. But we complained and they said there was nothing we could do till the following morning. They send a girl with bug spray but that was about all that was done. The following day we sort of had to wait around. We were told the night before to see the manager in the morning. Then the morning staff told us to see the afternoon staff. Finally we were told to pack up out stuff and leave it in the room and when we came back to resort later in the day we would have a new room. When we came back, we were given a hotel room key only to find a room with no luggage. After a couple of calls to the front desk, someone came to our room to tell us our luggage was missing. At this point, I nearly lost it. I was ready to move to a different hotel and so forth but our luggage was found almost immediately after I nearly blasted the front desk. In retrospect I feel bad about getting so mad, but come on... how can these issues keep happening. After this was resolved, everything else was great... So on to the good stuff.... the resort if beautiful. The grounds are well kept and there are endless employees that make sure each area is perfect. The beach area is the best. The palm trees are wide spread and the area feels so tropical. Also, the ocean is the perfect turquoise color you want. Some of the restaurants we went to were... Japanese - sushi appetizer for the table is just ok, the noodles were delicious and so was the shrimp entr\u00e9e. Also, don't miss the fried ice cream, I think this was the best dessert in the whole resort. All in all, pretty good. Brazilian - this is like the typical churrascaria but better. The meats here are delicious... try the sauces and the breads as well. I was impressed with everything here. I just couldn't be happier with the taste and quality of the meat. Even the black bean soup was the best I have ever had. I do wish they had an a la carte dessert option instead of the buffet however. But this is the best restaurant in the complex. Chilis (steak house) - the chilled seafood app there is huge and delicious. The steaks are very tender and the lobster is grilled but also good. A sure runner up to the Brazilian restaurant. The dessert show is awesome, full of fire and performance, but they taste pretty bland. Mexican - our entrees were all in all no good. There are two sides of the salad buffet here, a cold side and hot side. If you go, fill your plate with the stuff on the hot side as the chicken was gross and the fajitas were sub par. Back to the Resort, the location is fabulous and was a great reason to stay there. You can walk to a small shopping complex in playacar, or to the city of playa del carmen which is just fabulous. I miss it already. Lots of shopping, beaches and your choice of restaurants. Here are some additional remarks.. if you are active, check out Xplor theme park for a crazy unique adventure, if you have a family and are interested in wildlife check out Xcaret. If you are thinking of taking the ferry to Cozumel, do not go on sunday as almost everything is closed. Also, if you don't have a dinner restaurant bring $5 and ask for the head waiter... you'll have no problem getting in. Also, your bracelet is also a pass into any of the other Riu's should you want to change the view for an afternoon.

Bathrooms were clean, with whirlpool tubs. Room- Spacious, well mapped out. Beds are NOT comfortable. Couldnt get good night sleep on them, not my style. Sitting area is nice, with couch. Balcony very large, but does not face, or have any view of the Ocean! There are not many ocean view rooms. A lot that do, also face the courtyard, which means people will be watching you, which creeps me out. The minibar was a Great touch. Liquor was nice, but the great part is Bottled Water and Beer. Constantly restocked, it was nice to have water whenever you need it, and large bottles. Amenities - The grounds are nice, not really much there. Fountains are small, but clean. The Spa is ok, fitness room is small. Hot tub area was nice, two hot tubs and some chairs. Pool was nice size but ICE COLD. Also, there is an infinity pool that flows into the main pool, also ice cold. Not sure why, but it is always freezing in there. The swim up bar was ok. Pool chairs are hard to come by in the \"prime\" areas. Best bet is tipping a groundsman. Beach area was very nice. Plenty of chairs. Free kayaks, boogie boards, and sail boats are nice. Nearby shop has parasailing and snorkel tours etc. Plenty to do. Dining - Sit Down restaurants were all average for the most part. The reservation system is a joke. You have to pick the place 1-2 days in advance, and it can be difficult to get a reservation. Then, most places would give you a hard time if you didnt have one, despite being empty. Very odd setup with that. The buffets however were very good. Plenty to choose from. We stayed for 8 days, so it does become a bit monotonous, you can only eat soo much guacamole. Bars - Great. They really serve you well at all the bars. They dont cheap out. There may not be Grey Goose, or real top-tier liquors, but they have enough. And the service at all the bars was first rate. From the upscale lobby bar, to the sandals and tank top pool bar, and even the sports bar, all went out of their way. Overall the trip was a 3.5 out of 5. The service does \"fish\" for tips.

Rooms and property were spotless, pool and beach very nice. Location is ideal being that it's not too far from town. Walked the beach to and from Playa few times and took $5 USD cab rides when dressed up. Food was very good but we did choose to go to Playa for dinner a few times. We ate at the steakhouse, brazilian and fusion restaurants. Our group was all very pleased. Breakfast and lunch buffets had many choices and was always fresh. Liked that you could eat at a different restaurant every night if you choose and never had to buffet it for dinner. Beach chairs didn't seem to be much of an issue although by 10 am most of the pool chairs had the usual towel, book or shoe placed on them for saving. Never will understand that practice, but whatever. We just chose the beach. Would rather listen to the surf than the loud music and occasional game, but to each his own. Beach drink service was sporadic, some days good, others rarely available, but it doesn't hurt to get out of your chair every once in a while to get your own. Staff always has a smile and seem to be happy to do whatever they can to ensure that you're having a good vacation. Victor in the sports bar was always happy and fun, we know that because we spent some time with him everyday. Enjoyable entertainment in the courtyard nightly. Never did attend one of the shows but heard they were good. We all decided this was one property we would definitely return to again. Loved everything about it.

We were lucky enough to stay in the jacuzzi suite (room 2118) Right at the end of hotel, long walk from lobby but meant no noise really from other guests as there were only 3 rooms at the end of the corridor. The Suite \"wow\" , was prob twice the size of junior suites, walk in wardrobe huge living room area, huge king size bed, large plasma which you could spin round to either living area or bed, huge jacuzzi bath seperating bedroom & bathroom double sinks, seperate shower! Was so impressed with inside but outside was even better! Sea View amazing, breathtaking. balconany was large with spiral stairs up to the outdoor jacuzzi! Room service which is 24 hour & included in your all inc is great, we ordered coffee and cake most afternoons and just sat on the balconly checking out the amazing view & sometimes breakfast! x We also requested champagne to the room on a number of occasions which was a great treat with the jacuzzi!!x We ate at all the speciality resteraunts, could not fault the food at all, we never got bored of being in the resort as we felt we were dining somewhere different every evening. Japanese was my favourite, but my hubby prefered Chilli's as he is a steak man! Champagne served with every meal, infact served all day every day/time! The hotel staff are amazing, they are so hard working as so busy all of the time. Our room was cleaned everyday we left tips most days but sometimes forgot, rooms were still cleaned to same standard and cute animal towels left. Every evening our bed was 'turned down' with chocolate left on pillow too. What a beautiful touch! The manager on reception even lent my husband his belt on our wedding day as he had forgot to pack his!! Wedding - wow, the wedding team were amazing, I wanted a no fuss wedding. I had myself, partner & 10 guests. We had ceromony at gazebo by the pool at 4pm (thought it might be little cooler then), It went like a dream, yes other guests watched from a far but non of them are in the wedding pics its a resort so this is gonna happen. The flowers and set up looked amazing, the judge was great, not stuffy so was so relaxed and only lasted about 15 mins. After few pics we headed to lobby bar for cocktail hour then meal at chillies table looked amazing, was tucked out of the way of other guests. The food again was fab, guests could choose from lamb, steak, seafood or chicken so something for everyone. We had our wedding cake for desert so not to waste it!! I took my boquet and other flowers up to my room and had them as a flower arrangement for the rest of the hol!! There is so many wonderful things about this hotel, the staff and the area Im sure i have not mentioned half of it!!

The lobby is wonderful and the staff are great. Our room was cleaned everyday and when we asked them for anything (more towels, water etc) it was always brought promptly. The king room is really just 2 doubles pushed together but it isn't anything one would notice. Playacar is a short walk from 5th ave. Super touristy but lots of shops, spas and restaurants. I wouldn't suggest getting a massage on the hotel premises as it is $$. We tried Sabaii Spa and it was wonderful. They even gave us the option of getting our massages out doors in their jungle like garden. Was a little too hot and humid for that.

I'm very fussy and took ages before deciding on this hotel. We stayed for 10 days and could not really fault it. The service was great- I was very impression with the maid service- the rooms were always cleaned daily and on top of that they would pop in every night to check if we needed anything. All of the restaurants were great, our favourites were the Mexican and the japanese. In the day time, its best to go to the buffet restaurant rather than Chilli's beach side restaurant as it gets rammed in there and the buffet always had a better menu on! We found that the pool was very busy and people tended to reserve the loungers but the beach is so close to the bar and it was always more chilled down there. Joe was the most helpful waiter and he really looks after you. We gave small tips randomly throughout the holiday but the service was great without it. In some of the speciality restaurants, it was good to tip as they would be extra attentive on the second visit.......In the area itself was great- taxi's were cheap into Playa del Carmen. In terms of day trips, we would recommend the speed boat trip in Cancun and the Fat Cat sunset trip. We did the Coba trip but would warn people that it was a very long and was a little boring at times with alot of waiting around, but the pyramid was worth the climb!.....Overall this hotel was amazing and we heard a lot of guests from the other Riu's saying how jealous they were.

My wife, daughters (15 and 19) and I were there over New Year's. We had main floor rooms - deliberately not adjacent. Yes, it was a tad noisy early in the morning - but in some cases, it was the voices of younger folks coming back to their rooms at 4 a.m. after the disco. Excellent buffet, decent dinners at the gourmet restaurant and Chilis (the steak house) albeit neither was exceptional. But then again - this is ALL INCLUSIVE. And one can't expect gourmet meals under the circumstances. A note about the food: our 15 year old is Celiac (intolerant to Gluten) and the chefs and food staff were OUTSTANDING in making sure she was accommodated. They made special meals for her at almost every sitting, and they pointed out the safe and not safe foods for her to eat. It helped that my wife speaks fluent Spanish; but once the point had been made, we had no problem. The buffet meals were the best, in our opinion. Tremendous service overall, great bartenders, nothing but praise. And the animation team (organizing activities) was high spirited; we did the morning stretch class, beach volleyball, aerobics classes, saw the nightly entertainment daily - it was generally top-rate.

Repeat Visitor (Detailed)\u201d", "Author": "tanned-n-happy", "ReviewID": "UR92100652", "Content": "I travelled to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya from the 19-26th of December 2010. First I would like to say that I travel a lot, being to the sandos caracole village, viva wyndham Maya, iberostar paraiso lindo, Riu caribe, Riu palace Riviera Maya, now jade, Riu negril and the Riu palace Riviera Maya back in 2006. I can honestly say that this wasn\u2019t the worst trip I\u2019ve been on, but definitely not the best. It was a real let down from four years ago, the hotel really aged. Airport : The shuttle from the airport was okay. Right after we went through security, it was easy to find the sunwing bus to the hotel. It was a long drive, (about 50 minutes) but we knew that coming. We were the last stop on the bus, so it was interesting seeing the different hotels in the area. Check in : It wasn\u2019t too bad. We got the rooms that we wanted (facing the grounds) with no extra fee. (3092 + 3093). We got the bracelets. Although they ran out of the light blue children\u2019s bands, so we had to get one in the morning, there was no problem getting food or drinks without it. The staffs were very apologetic over the smallest things. Really wonderful staff. Rooms : Good: The rooms didn\u2019t smell musty which was good. Because we were on the third floor, we did not have a sofa with a step down, it was all one level with two chairs. We didn\u2019t find this because there was less chance of tripping or falling. It also had a tall ceiling like an attic. The TV was a bit hard to see from the bed, so we just moved and turned it. They have many channels, although most are in Spanish. The best channel was 38. It was Warner brothers, it played the new adventures of old Christine, two and half men, big bang theory, mike and molly nearly all the time. This is a Spanish channel, but the shows are in English with Spanish sub-titles. The movies on the other hand are just Spanish. 35 was Sony, played king of queens and other shows. There was always something you could find to watch before you go to bed. The rooms were cleaned every day pretty early. The toilet clogged the first day we were there, a call to the lobby, and a guy came to fix it within ten minutes. It takes almost no time for the water to get hotel, which was good for a quick shower. Bad: The bathtubs are DISGUSTING. They seem as if they were never cleaned since it opened. We even tried to clean it, but I was just so full of scum and dirt. If you decide to come here, you can only take showers. While the room did not smell, everything was wet. I personally did not mind this, but it was an inconvenience. Also make sure you aren\u2019t too far from the elevator if you can\u2019t go up and down stairs. Lobby : Good: There was free wifi (really slow though), big Christmas tree and tons of sofas and chairs to sit on while you are on your computer. They have plugs all around as well if you have to charge up your computer or ipod. If you can\u2019t find a plug, just unplug a lamp, they don\u2019t mind as long as you plug it back in when you\u2019re done. Bad: Let\u2019s be honest\u2026 The hotel smells like vomit. Other places more then others. On the sofas near the gift shops, that\u2019s probably the best spot do go in the computer without gagging. The walk past the bar and down the stairs to go outside is the worst. There must be some old vomit there and no one has cleaned it up yet. It just smells REALLY bad. The floor is also sticky near the bar. I didn\u2019t order one drink from the lobby bar, so I can not comment on the strength of the drinks there. The sports bar also smelt, not so much as vomit, but cigars and vomit, not a nice smell for most people. The food available at the sports bar looks rather dubious; I would not suggest eating it, and ordering room service. The games there you have to pay for, a game of air hockey it\u2019s 2 bucks American. Grounds: Good: They are very well kept. The fountains are nice as well as the benches. There are always gardeners or people fixing the fountains to make sure it\u2019s perfect. At night there are lights on the palms that make it a really nice night scene. Bad: There is nothing bad about the grounds, they are always clean and perfect. Pool: Good: it looks pretty and was clean. The loungers were the best to cool off while still tanning. Bad: It is ice cold. I tried to swim in it once I couldn\u2019t get past the knees. Maybe it was because it was cold at night, but the pool was unbearable. You will see that there are very few people who are in the pool. Beach : Good: it was beautiful turquoise. You were able to walk forever, both ways. The best spot of the whole beach is to the left of the hotel. Once you pass the reef playacar, the few homes, there is a smallish brown hotel. If you go there early in the morning, you can find many beautiful conchs shells. Nearing the end of that hotel, it is a really shallow beach, with no sea shells and soft sand. You almost sank it was so soft. There, the deepness went down and went back up farther into the ocean. Hence you could sit on the sand a few yards it. It was spectacular! (No seaweed either!) Bad: In front of the hotel, the beach had a lot of small seashells, which was that much of a problem. But as you get into the water, there is a strip of really rough seashells. Once you get passed that there isn\u2019t much more. The only other problem was the seaweed liked to grab your leg, various trash bags, and the occasion hunk of coral that I myself cut my foot badly on. Be extremely careful walking into the ocean to prevent hurting and stubbing your feet and toes. Kids Club: They do have a kids club. In the area they have a small playground which I saw various kids using, so I guess it was fun. The kids pool/wadding pool was pretty disgusting on the other hand. I believe they knew that no one was using it, because they obviously did not use and cleaning supplies on it. It was cloudy and green. The building was air-conditioned very well, almost too cold. Tons of activities available for young kids. Food: Good: The Krystal restaurant was very good. I would recommend reserving that restaurant at least once. We eat there on our last night, and wished that we booked it before. The beef was amazing; really tender it melted in your mouth. The appetizers were interesting; don\u2019t be afraid to try anything weird, because you can end up really liking it. The salad was really good; it was interesting to have a salty and sweet salad. The desserts were also very good; the chocolate molten chocolate muffin was amazing, which hot chocolate syrup inside. The Brazilian was also very good. I would suggest reading the menu and choose which one you life to make sure you save room for it. They come around with all of the different meats so you have the opportunity to try everything. Although if you eat too much at the beginning there is no more room left for the last things to come. I feel like they came in order from worst to best. The sausages were really spicy and good. The Mexican was good. The chicken fajitas were nice, because you could add your own sauce and make them how you like. The chicken breast was also good. The breakfast buffet was decent. Like any of the breakfast buffets in any other hotel. There are omelettes, bacon, eggs, sausages, hash browns, all sorts of breads and jams, fruits, yogurts, cold cuts, cheese. The usual. The only thing I would suggest is to not drink the milk that\u2019s in the dispensers by the orange juice. I watched as they poured it in. It comes in a large bucket, which isn\u2019t that gross. But as they poured, the bottom and sides were covered with curdled milk. It was as they say very chunky milk; therefore you could get sick if you use it in cereal. Just be careful. (My suggestion is to eat rice every lunch and dinner, it\u2019s always very good and it prevents you from getting the runs) Bad: The lunch and dinner buffets were just horrible. There was never really any selection. It was the same stuff every day, but it wasn\u2019t even good. At lunch I had a hamburger and pizza every day because there was nothing else. (There pizzas were really good though) I also experimented with the Mexican foods, and the kinds of beef or pork or chicken, but I also ended up spitting it out because it was good or tasted funny. It was really disappointing because the hotel had really good food 4 years ago. Also, do NOT eat the guacamole at the lunch buffet. My oldest daughter ate it, can got EXTREME food poisoning, she was so sick that she missed Christmas eve dinner to be in the washroom throwing up. It was a real shame, because it ruined Christmas. She was also very upset that she missed the whole set-up for Christmas. She was sick for about 3 days, and uneasy for the next 4 at home, so it was pretty bad. One day, there was absolutely no selection at the beach lunch buffet that I went to the one near the lobby. I found some okay beef and pork, which I saw later at dinner. One evening I went to get dessert and someone threw up all over the desserts, the dessert table and floor. It was so appalling. Christmas: The Christmas buffet was really nice. If anyone plans to visit at Christmas, I say the dinner is a much. They really spent a lot of time setting up. Each table had new linens, candles, menus, and amazing staff bringing you drinks. There were too many butter sculptures to count. It was a really nice spread. They were carving turkey, beef and had cranberry sauce. Many selections of sides, with fries, carrots, rice, noodles, tons of vegetables, caviar. It was the best of the buffets all week. Desserts were outside; they had a cracker house, the chocolate fountain with strawberries to dip in as well. Cherries, cakes, cookies (they had no cookies all week!) and every other fruit. They had m any nice ice sculptures as well. There even had a papier Mache Santa with his sleigh and reindeers included. (It was a shame they didn\u2019t have any of the decorations left for Christmas day.) They had music going until midnight (babies be warned) but it was a really nice feeling in the courtyard Christmas Eve. Tons of champagne. Christmas Day: Because in Mexico they celebrate Christmas Eve as the big thing, Christmas day wasn\u2019t really anything special. The only thing that was special was at noon, Santa came from the beach and gave out presents to the kids, as well as a show for kids with really funny (not in the good way) costumes of Shrek, kung fu pandas, ice age, etc. It was really nice that they tried to do a nice show for the kids. Service and Staff: I decided to save the best part of the hotel for last. The staff at this hotel is amazing! They are extremely nice and work soo hard. We didn\u2019t even tip some days, and they were still top notch servers. Around the pool bar, good old Charlie was an amazing server. He would serve the whole pool bar by himself, and came around and asked every half hour. I was never without a drink. Although by the beach it\u2019s a bit slower (they only serve up until the wall) but they comes at least once a day with drinks. The room was cleaned everyday pretty early. We never came back to an un-cleaned room. As for the mini bar, they only came around once the whole week with the trolley. Just go to the front desk and ask for the drink you want. They always came with the drink very quickly. The front desk staffs were very nice and helpful. They ordered you cabs, told you the best places to eat in playa Del Carmen and helped you with anything else you would need. In the buffets, they always brought you the drink you ask for within seconds. The a la carte staffs were very nice, they always tried to joke with us, but be aware that their sarcasm isn\u2019t always the best haha. I have not one bad thing to say about the staff and the service. Even for the chefs or servers that didn\u2019t speak very good English always tried their hardest. Point blank, they are one of the hardest working staffed hotels around. The service could not compare with the service at Riu negril. Conclusion: All in all it is a 5 star hotel with 2 star foods. Just because of the food it should not be classified as a 5 star. Yes, it is a lovely building with lovely staff, but it would be so much better with a heated pool and better food. On the first night we were planning to come back next Christmas for my 20th anniversary to renew my vows, but after the week of bland food, vomit scented lobby and stage area, and food poisoning, we are going to try a different hotel. I think I will stay away from rius until a new one opens up. It is an amazing chain, but hotels just tire out quickly. It pains me to write this but, 5 star hotel, bad food -1 4 star hotel, food poisoning, -1 3 star hotel, filthy bathroom, -1 2 star hotel.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cWow, what a Christmas and New Year\u201d", "Author": "rosieowen", "ReviewID": "UR92067144", "Content": "This was the best Riu hotel we have been to.

We had never stayed at a Riu property before but had been told by many who had that they were always very nice. Check-in could not have gone smoother and we were taken right to our room. When we were not all that thrilled about the location of the room, they had no trouble switching us to one closer to the pool area right away. For a short stay, a regular room was just fine. Was not worried about what the view from the room was because, really, how much time are you spending in your room staring out the window. For our first night there, the only restaurant that was open was the buffet because it was Christmas Eve, but boy what a spread did they put out. You could have gotten lost looking at all of the choices. We had arrived too late on the first day to make dinner reservations for the following nights so we had to do that on our second day. When I arrived to do it, there was a sign saying \"Sorry all restaurants are booked for tonight\" Completely unacceptable. I had tried three times to e-mail the resort ahead of time to see if it was possible to make my dinner reservations before we arrived, but not one of the e-mails was answered. (That is definitely something that they could work on). When I complained enough to the person doing the reservations, she suddenly was able to find not one, but two restaurants that had seats available for the first night(We would have normally just gone into Playa for dinner that night, but since it was Christmas, we didn't expect anything to be open). We had dinner at Chilis, the \"steakhouse\" that night, and boy were we disappointed. The food was only so-so, and the portions were tiny. Also, to our surprise, there had to be at least three other empty tables. After talking with some other guests, they said they had noticed the same thing in their restaurants about there being empty tables. The only other restaurant we ate at was the Brazliian, and let's just say that it was much better than Chilis from the food to the service to not having to shoo away stray cats from your table every two minutes. The resort itself was wonderful. Nice and small so it never felt overcrowded. Very nice pool area. Yes, both the regular pool and the infinity pool were a little on the cold side, but I think that had more to do with the unseasonally cool weather they had been having down there. There is only one bar at the pool which can cause some logjams in getting a drink when the pool is busy, but it was never a real problem. The drink glasses are definitely on the small side, and they make them very weak so the solution was to either order two or three at a time, bring a large mug from home or just order more frequently. As to the strength, once you got to know a bartender or two(Or gave them a healthy tip), they would make them at any strength you wanted. All you had to do was ask. One of the most annoying things about the resort was lounge chair saving. Yes, there are signs that say this is prohibited, but who are they kidding? You pretty much have to have a towel on a chair by 6:00 in the morning if you want one anywhere in a prime location. What we noticed is that most people just didn't return their towels at the end of the day and would have them on a lounge before you even woke up. Then, when they would finally get around to showing up for the day, sometimes not until the late afternoon, they would just take their old towel over and exchange it for a new one. We definitely saw our share of dust ups over folks arguing over whose lounge chair was whose. And as for the limited number of little tables to put your drinks on, we heard of plenty of folks who thought they had saved one when they came out to reserve their chair only to find it gone when they arrived. The beach was most definitely one of the better ones we had seen at resorts on the Riviera Maya, and we have been to a bunch. Very wide, very walkable and not rocky at all. We normally stay at an adults only resort when we go to Playa, but I must say most of the children at the Riu were very well behaved. The mini bar was continuously re-stocked with bottles of soda, beer and water which was nice. There was an open air market outside the front of the resort which we never made it to, but it looked nice. It was barely a 15 minute walk into Playa Del Carmen, we highly recommend La Parilla for great Mexican food and then having a drink at the rooftop bar of the Azteca hotel right across the street, best view in the town.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, the staff was awesome\u201d", "Author": "jodus20", "ReviewID": "UR91967950", "Content": "This hotel was the newest of the RIU hotels, it was always clean and the staff was super friendly.

After reading all the reviews we booked this hotel. We arrived on December 10th and left on December 16th. We were traveling with our girls (2 & 4 years old). This hotel would be perfect for us if it weren't for the fact that our kids are allergic to milk and wheat. Most of the food at the hotel at had been cooked with butter. We had to go the Japanese restaurant every night to request plain rice for the kids to eat. Most of time they ate fries and bacon. Next time we are going to go to a hotel that we can order special food for the kids. Pros: -Free drinks. -Free bottled water -Beautiful beach with coconut trees and hammocks -Kid club had really nice teachers. They really go out of their way to find kids and expose them to the kids club. My older girl actually went up to the stage by herself one of the disco nights (8:30 pm kids hour) and danced. It was amazing to see her like that! -Our waiter Nicolas in the dinning room is super fast. We love the service in the main buffet. The food in the buffet was the best. In the morning they had yummy fruit juices. -Playacar is a nice area to walk around. We would stroll the kids to Playa Del Carmen (5th Ave) and then take the taxi home ($5). -Hector our hotel bell man was great. He arranged for someone to take us to Crococun Zoo & the Aquarium in Cancun for $100 round trip. The driver waited for us where ever we went, it was so nice. No worry of finding a taxi. -Lots of food at the buffets. The Japanese restauraunt was good except that they had immitation crab. Chilis for dinner was OK. Food is probably 4 out of 5 stars. I guess if I want the real stuff I have to go to a 5 star hotel. -Free Wifi in lobby is great when it works. A few times I tried and it didn't work. Computers in the bar costs $8/hour. Cons: -The housekeeper couldn't remember that their are 4 of us in the room so he kept giving us 2 towels. Then when we requested it, it takes more than 2 hours to get some. We got the animal towels for the 1st, 2nd, & last night. My little girl asked how come we didn't get the animals everyday. We tipped everyday! -Chili is so so. We were expecting the same juices at Chili for lunch but we got artificial juices. It tastes really bad, how can anyone drink the pineapple juice there. -Pool is cold. Not really anyone was swimming in it. The beach was warmer than the pool. -Sushi had crab immitation not real crab. Our room smelled fine. The A/C was adequate. We had to turn it down when we got there. We got an extended balcony which was really nice. Don't expect to find any good shopping deals in Cancun. You can probably get everything in the states for 1/2 at much sometimes. Remember to bring everything you need, else you will have to pay twice as much to get it in Cancun/Playa Del Carmen. Recommend you should visit Crococun Zoo. It cost each adults $23. The kids under 4 are free. We got to feel & feed snakes, crocodile, dears. It was only 1 hrs & 20 minutes for the tour, but well worth it. Bring sand toys for the kids or you'll have to go to Playa Del Carmen to buy some. Be aware of timeshare people. They are everywhere, they'll talk to you and offer free maps or so....they just suck the time out of you.

We stayed here December 18 thru 26th and had 2 rooms 1001 and 1006. I won't review the food or the grounds or the beautiful lobby, it has all been said before. The accommodations were no where near what they should have been. We had the following issues: The first day we had about a 50 to a hundred flies swarming above the door to the room. I went to the front desk and they sprayed something to kill them. It worked. It worked all week, as we would find a dead fly or two outside the door all week. The room 1001 didn't have an iron, or ironing board. I called the front desk, they brought us an iron (only). The room 1001 the safe broke with our stuff in it. Had to wait for a manager to come by with a special device to unlock it. A few days the towels were not refreshed by 5pm, we had to call for towels, or stop by the maids room for towels. One day my daughter had to use two hand towels to dry off and dry her long hair. We asked for a roll away bed for room 1006 a couple of times, it was finally delivered by 9pm. Most days on the balcony is smelled like a human waste processing plant was outside the door. Christmas night the room actually smelled a human waste processing plant. The smell would come and go from about 8 pm until midnight. The coffee pot didn't work in room 1001. Had to get it replaced. One of my kids misplaced a towel or towel card, and they wanted me to pay $20 to replace a towel. Those towels aren't worth two dollars. Maybe they are worth $20 new, but we never seen a new towel the whole week. We did see a lot of stained old towels. I went to the front desk and told the front desk lady about the missing card and all the problems we had and that she should give me another towel card right now, or go get the manager, she gave me the card. Come on RIU this towel card is a bad joke, and RIU has been doing this for years. We have been to many other resorts and have not had to get towel cards. We were at Beaches Turks and Cacois in the summer, no towel cards. It was nice. If you wanted 3 towels help yourself. They always had fresh towels out. When I complained about a few of the items above, and I asked to be moved, they did try to accommodate us. But it wouldn't be until the next day, and I had to stop by after breakfast to get the new room numbers. Then come back after 12 noon to see the rooms, and then pack and they would move us by 3pm. We decided to stay in the original rooms, which probably was a mistake, but the thought of moving and wasting a good part of the day doing moving and waiting wasn't what we wanted to do. The beach looks nice. The only gripe I have with the beach is there is a 1 to 2 foot drop from the beach to the water. This makes for an unpleasant transition from the beach to the water.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointment\u201d", "Author": "marpol1", "ReviewID": "UR90513620", "Content": "We stayed in the RIU hotels many times and it was always our first choice in the Caribbean.

Great location with about a 20+ minute walk or $5 cab ride into downtown Playa Del Carmen where there is a ton of shops and more upscale nightlife. Great place to hang at night or during the days and lots of police around so you would feel pretty safe. The main buffet area was huge with attractive furnishings. The grounds were kept very clean and manicured. Rooms - My girlfriend and I stayed in a basic studio suite but it was very nice with a balcony that overlooked the side garden though you could see the ocean looking to one side. There's a good amount of drawer space and a large sliding door cabinet to hang clothes that also has a safe to keep valuables. A/C worked very well and temperature was never a problem indoors. Bathroom is well lit and ventilated. Beds were as usual for Mexico resorts, quite hard but they were also curiously very comfortable and we slept very well. There was a booze dispenser with 4 battles of various alcohols (all name brand) and the refrigerator was stocked with plenty of water and sodas each day. The cable TV carried a wide selection of English stations with good movie content. You were able to hear out in the halls and the noise from the occasional late night partier getting back to their room could easily be heard. Food & Drinks: You had to make reservations in the lobby for any of the onsite menu restaurants between noon and 3 and as we were doing excursions almost every day or were otherwise busy, we didn't get a chance to make reservations. We ate with a dinner party at Chili's steak restaurant and the steak I had was OK. It was cooked well but not a great cut of meat. Lunch's buffet was served at Chili's and breakfast and dinners buffets were served in the large restaurant near the hotel lobby. Both the breakfast and dinner buffets were very good with a very large variety of foods to choose from. Service in the buffet area was very good as well. Drinks on the other hand were very weak and for such a nice resort they didn't use much what I would consider \"top shelf\" alcohols. The drinks were always made weak regardless of what bar you drank at though the Sports Bar served the best IMO. If you plan on spending the day at the pool or beach then bring a large drinking mug from home because the pool bar served the weakest drinks in very small plastic cups. The beach in front of the hotel is large and even if you ordered 2 drinks for yourself they wouldn't last long and you could find yourself making a number of trips the pool bar to get a buzz, and I'm a fairly light drinker at that. Service - Great. Rooms were well attended too and leaving a couple dollars every day was much appreciated. All the front desk help spoke good English and were very helpful. Most of the rest of the help spoke some English and being able to speak just a little Spanish made communication no problem. Table service was good at the restaurant we ate at and the bartenders were also very nice. If you could convince them to make you a strong drink, tip them a buck here and there. Misc. - High speed WiFi internet is available in the lobby but I barely call it high speed. I use VoIP for calling home and the connection speed is too slow to make a decent call using either Skype or Magicjack, both of which I tried. The Beach is beautiful and there are plenty of chairs though you have to compete for chairs at the pool and get your towel out early. Room service was part of the AI and they were quick to respond but the food selection was very minimal.

Grounds are fantastic. The rooms are spacious, and the staff are beyond words. Some staff work 12 + hrs a day, 6 days a week and still really enjoy their jobs. Santos & Joe go out of their way for you, gotta love them!! The animation team is fantastic. We went to see the evening entertainment every night and loved almost every one.

We went in with low expectations, as we're used to great Canadian beef, but were really surprised with the very first bite. It was fabulous. Pool: Ok the pool is really cold.....all the time but hey if you're warm enough, you'll get in. I usually like my pools to feel like bath water but I still went in a few times a day. One tip, charge right in, don't try the one step at a time. At the beginning of our trip, we met a lot of couples who said that it was their 3rd, or 4th, or even 5th time vacationing there.

One other tip: If you're 20 something and looking to just party, this resort is not for you. its great here don't get me wrong, but not what you're looking for.

Octavio, Luis, Rosario, Veronica - these are the people that make my stay here at the Palace special. Let\u2019s start by saying that this is the third trip my wife and I have taken to Riu Place Riviera Maya. We originally chose this location for the reviews about the beach. And yes, the beach is spectacular. By far the best we have seen on our trips around the Yucatan area. This year is very special because it\u2019s our wedding anniversary. We thought long and hard about where in the world we would like to celebrate the occasion. The idea of the warm service that my friend Luis Cetina offers every time we come to eat at the Don Manolo buffet makes my wife and I smile. Luis has continued to make our stay here a pleasure. He is very professional, very friendly, happy, and is real professional at making us feel welcome. We enjoy the conversations with Luis and appreciate him very much. Let\u2019s speak about Rosario for a moment. Here\u2019s a guy that invites us into his world and delivers exemplary service with a smile- we love it. Rosario makes the dining experience at the Japanese restaurant an excellent experience for sure. Octavio greeted us after a long day of travel and his smile and warm personality was inviting. He went above and beyond the call of duty to make my wife and I feel right at home. He made sure we had all the comforts needed to make the visit special. Veronica is a gal with a million dollar smile, it\u2019s fantastic. The glow on her face continues to be a daily pleasure to see here. But let\u2019s be clear she is a very hard worker; non-stop moving at a pace that is amazing how much she gets done, but still seems to have time to stop and say hello and make us both smile. This kind of service is rare and we almost never see it in the USA, I think these four people genuinely care about making us feel comfortable. They even remembered our names from when we last visited in April, 2010. Upon arrival, Luis immediately came to us with open arms and said \u201cWelcome back, nice to see you again! How was your trip?\u201d Now that is why we come back year after year! So let\u2019s move on to the resort itself, it is fantastic, it\u2019s elegant, it\u2019s spotless, it\u2019s safe, and it\u2019s fun. The pools are perfect, not too warm, and not too cool; just a perfect blend. We have stayed in the Jacuzzi suit all the way on the end looking out to the ocean, wow these rooms are the best. And we have stayed in the court yard view room, it is also very well appointed and comfortable. The beach is amazing! We love the freedom it offers. For example, if you\u2019re feeling like a walk, just turn left and take about a 15 minute stroll and you have the beautiful little town of Playa del Carmen. Lots to see and do. There is a modern section, as well as an authentic Mexican section. Catch the ferry to Cozumel, do a little shopping, or just have some lunch. As I mentioned earlier this trip is for my wedding anniversary. We told Luis the first day we were here that Friday was the actual day of our anniversary, and he remembered this, and later told us that he was going to change his day off so he could be here to help us celebrate and be as comfortable as possible. All I can say about that is WOW! It is difficult to verbalize how perfect our trips to Riu Palace Riviera Maya have been, so in conclusion I say: trust me, spend the money and get down there and prepare to be engulfed by a warm, friendly, hard-working army of people that will give you an extraordinary tropical experience.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cAnother Wonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "VirginiaMaggie", "ReviewID": "UR89539874", "Content": "Riu Palace Riviera Maya is wonderful and beautiful.

The Good: - The hotel itself is very nice (architecture wise). The OK: - Food is hit or miss. Specialty restaurants disappoint (with exception of Krystal). Stick to the main dining hall. - Beach is OK but dirty and no umbrellas. Hotel staff doesn't seem to pick-up the trash so the tide does it for them. The Bad: - Roaches in 2 rooms we stayed in. - No customer service at front desk or concept there of. - No towels or bottled water (check upon check-in). - 6AM wake-up calls by people leaving their rooms (soundproofing should be better) Details: 10 days ago, my wife and I tried to enjoy a short honeymoon at Riu Palace Riviera Maya. The first night we got to our room (#2047) to find a roach infestation (killed 12 of them). Luis at the front desk did not apologize, did not offer anything in a way of a partial refund, and did not even offer to help us move our bags from one side of the hotel complex to the other (#2047 -> #3087). All he promised to do is to personally \"check out\" the new room to make sure that everything was OK. The new room has no bottled water and no shower towels. Back to the front desk I went (~12:15am)\u2026 In the morning I spoke to Havier (day manager) who refused to issue us any kind of partial refund. I asked for the general complaint phone number and was told that there isn\u2019t one. Instead I was offered an email address (customerserviceamericas@riu.com), which I promptly emailed. It has now been 10 days without a reply from this address. I asked Havier for the toll-free Riu reservation number. Talking to the person at the reservation line also did not help as they too referred me to the useless email address (see above). Upon checkout I was charged ~$5 USD for making the 1 minute call to Riu\u2019s own toll free reservation number. The mind boggles\u2026 We tried to rebook our flight tickets to leave earlier but the cost of re-booking was excessive and we had to stay. The new room had a much lesser problem with roaches (only killed one).", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guisborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cfantastic\u201d", "Author": "valjohnson", "ReviewID": "UR89071213", "Content": "cannot praise this hotel enough, our 3rd visit 2nd this year already booked for next year, from location, food, room, service staff to name a few of many who gave us excellent service, Luis, sammy, in the restuarant, alfredo, santos, marcella, saumy isiah chano in the lobby and plaza bars, london Joe and pancho on the beach, Maury in the japanese restuarant, and william in th mexican and also the reception staff who were always smiling and nothing was to much.

The food was a little worse then we expected, but we never were hungry. We mostly ate at the buffet. We found asian night to be the best. Tried Japanese restaurant- it was average. Drinks are very good with top shelf liquor. It is a bit boring at night, but nearby other Riu properties have disco, if you want to take 10-15 min walk. Our girls ( 17yo) were a little bored at night. We took them out to the 5 th avenue in Playa. There is a Senior Frog there, where they had a lot of fun.

We spent five nights at the Riu Palace RM. As soon as we arrived, we were welcomed with a drink, what a nice touch! We were told our room was not ready so went to Chillis for Lunch. There were burgers, pizza, pasta, chicken, salads, fruit, icecream, etc. The food wa very good, veggies were fresh, best guacamole we've ever had! We got our room about an hour later and noticed we didn't have towels!! We called reception and they said someone was going to bring them right away... it took them two hours! But we didn't mind. We liked that we had a fridge with soft drinks, beer and water! Mattress a bit hard as others have said and linens a bit old but we didn't care. The beach is beautiful! Whenever we wanted drinks (beer, soft drinks or cocktails) we had to go went to the pool bar. The guys that worked there were so nice! When we first arrived we thought about trying the specialty restaurants but after going to Don Manolos for dinner (the buffet option) we thought we didn't want to get stuck with just one type of food. The food at Don Manolos was AMAZING! We loved everything and we never got tired or bored. I had the best seafood risotto! so delicious.The breakfast (buffet at Don Manolo) was also very good, we loved the variety of fruit, juices, etc. The entertainment shows were fun. We also spent some time at the La Habana Bar. The drinks were very good, not watery or anything like that. I personally think that what makes this place so special, apart from the location, is the people that work here. They all treated us so nice. They always have a smile on their faces, regardless of whether you tip them or not (we did), they make you feel at home. Special thanks to Pancho (pool bar), Chano (La Habana), Gabriel (Don Manolos), Luis (entertainment venue/patio). All the entertainment crew was great too. I did the water aerobics twice, they were fun! Neither of us got sick. I used tap water to brush my teeth, my husband used bottle water. If I were the Manager, I would replace the beach towels and renovate the gym. The beach towels were kind of old and discolored and the gym equipment looked outdated.

We spent 9 days at the Riu and capped our stay with an absolutely perfect wedding. The Riu staff treated us and our 80 guests like royalty, catering to our every need and helpful in every possible way. The resort is 40 mins from the airport, best to book a DIRECT transfer in advance and go past all the timeshare/entertainment people after you pass through customs. On 1st impression, the lobby is breathtakingly beautiful. Very fast check-in (I'd recommend a room closer to the pool and facing the court yard). The property is amazing, beautiful and impecably clean. The resort is new, only 4-5 years old with about 400 rooms. Coconut and palm trees surround the resort, pool and beach areas and make for a tropical paradise. The weather was good, hot and in the high 80's and slightly humid, rained about 4 times during our 9 day stay, for 15-20 mins then the sun was out. The resort is U in shape with the pools at the end of the property bordering the beach, There is a main pool complete with swim-up bar and a connected infinity pool. Dozens of lounge chairs surround the pool and there was never any need to \"reserve\" a spot as quality space was plentiful. Tropical music plays most of the day which adds to the ambience. Wait staff come by often to serve drinks. Between the pool and the beach are rows of coconut trees with lounge chairs and hammocks underneath, a perfect break from the hot sun. The beach is wide, open and very clean, perfect for long romantic walks at night. Since Playacar is private, there are no vendors or timeshare people harrassing guests during the day and there's even drink service right on the beach! The water is turquiose blue, bluest I have ever seen. No more sandbags or beached whales, all gone now, as the beach was recently expanded with more sand, and beach combers roll through every morning. The resort is geared more toward adults but very kid friendly. Just a tiny kids area but the kids in our group had fun just swimming and playing on the beach. Pool and beach volleyball everyday and even sexy Bingo! Be cautious, European sunbathing is everywhere. Rooms are beautiful and very clean, had no issues whatsoever with smell or bugs, complete with a working safe, balcony, twin sinks, shower over tub and full mini-bar stocked fresh daily with tequilla, Dos Equis and bottled water. Bed was firm but comfortable and the AC could easily cool the room to fridge temp. The food was excellent with breakfast and dinner served in Don Manolo (buffet). The menu changed everyday with a huge selection of entres, salads, deserts and smoothies. Chilis is an open-air restaurant serving lunch (buffet) everyday, with American food and local dishes (I recommend the fresh tacos made to order and coconut ice cream). The quality of the food was superb and actually preferred over some of the specialty restaurants. We did try Krystal (fusion) and Botofogo (Brazillian steak), both quaint, romantic and smaller restaurants with average to small portions but unique and tasty dishes and worth a try. Nightly entertainment is perhaps the weakest part of the resort but the folks try hard to entertain with a different type of show every night. Nights with live local music was perhaps the best, people dancing and cocktailing outside in the courtyard. There is a lobby bar open all day and night til midnight but most nights were just spent outside in the courtyard. I do recommend tipping, although not required, the extra service and personal touch they give you will go very far during your stay. Our wedding planner was Nancy and she did everything possible to make sure our wedding was perfect, answering all our questions during planning and making sure that all our needs were met. Our wedding was in the courtyard at the center gazebo (The Plaza) which we felt was most private, the main gazebo off the beach presents with lots of on-lookers and gawkers from the pool and beach. We then had cocktails following the weding in the lobby bar and dinner at Botofogo. Our wedding cake was Tres Leches which our guests loved, unique and very delicious. After dinner, our family and friends gathered in the court yard again for live music. There is no club or place to dance at this resort but the Riu Tequilla is just a short walk away and downtown Playa (try The Blue Parrot) is just 5 mins away by cab. Downtown is definitely worth seeing, lots of great bars and shops and only $5 by cab or a 15 minute walk away, very safe and not too far. I would HIGHLY recommend this resort for anyone looking to relax in a beautiful place, be pampered every minute by staff who remember your name and just treated like royalty. It's also a perfect place for a wedding too! Any questions, pls feel free to message me.

I'm a critic so I pretty much tell it how it is. Trust me. First the good. Great service, pool, beach, staff, grounds and all around atmosphere. We were constantly served our drinks poolside and at night consistantly. We didn't even have to move. Cups or glasses by pooliside very small so I suggest bringing a coffee mug or beer mug which is insulated. They'll gladly fill it for you, no problem. I would sometimes tip a dollar but even when I did'nt the service would still be the same. There always asking you what you would like to drink. The labor is cheap in Mexico thats why they can afford such a large staff. The entertainment employees are great. I met people at this resort who come 1-2 times a year at this resort. They all love it. The bad which is minor. Beds are a bit hard and so are the pillows. We went to Walmart in Playa Del Carmen and bought 2 soft pillows for $10 so I would suggest bringing your own pillows. Tiles everywhere so when there wet very slippery. Food I would rate a 3/5 or 6/10. But typical hotel food. A la Carte I would rate a 4/10. Not very good. After trying 2 of them we stopped making reservations. We just ate at the buffet which was average. Brush your teeth with bottled water to be safe. We never got sick at all. Also AC system isn't the best but does the job. Suite rooms don't have ceiling fan above bed which sucked on those hot days with a weak AC system. Grounds were spottless. Working constantly sweeping and cleaning. They fumigate all the time so not many bugs around. Beach great, no rocks! Walking distance to 5th Ave In Playa Del Carmen (15min) Lots of Excursions near by I suggest Xel Ha , Xcaret ok, also heard XPLOR awesome. So if you want to do something do Xel Ha and Xplor. Parasailing was great . Satellite TV OK, not the greatest. Entertainment at night was good. Michael Jackson Show and Grease was great. Mostly couples at this resort. Playa Del Carmen shopping on 5th Ave was ok if you like tourist stuff which seems like 70% of all shops sell the exact same stuff. Negotiate and don't back down. These guys need money so don't back down. Oh and drugs everywhere. I'm a male who looks fairly young and I was being asked if I wanted to get high or if I wanted to buy weed. It's safe though. Just ignore them or just say no. They were calling my big boy wanna get high? Made me laugh but seriously it was safe. They're trying to make some cash that way too I guess. COCO BONGO was awesome as always. Pool was cleaned everynight but gets dirty by tourists dropping limes , straws etc in pool but very clean none the less.

Before we had even left, we obsessed over the news reports about Tropical Storm/ Hurricane Richard that was forecasted to hit the Yucatan on Monday. We left on Sunday. The weather reports were predicting rain and thunderstorms for the entire week. Needless to say, we weren't really too excited about this trip. We flew with WestJet out of Toronto which was probably the best flight we've taken to date. Very friendly, engaging flight attendants and, since we arrived there and back in one piece, great pilots. When we arrived at the Cancun airport, we did not run into any time share people. There was a helpful man working for the airport that tried to sell us \"discounted\" excursions provided we lived at the same address and could prove it. This happens alot in the area in our experience. This was offered on 5th Ave as well. We got on our bus and began the 45 minutes (roughly) ride to the hotel. The hotel is beautiful. It is located in Playacar, which is a residential type area. It is the last Riu on the road, you have access to all the other Riu's except for dinner at the a la cartes. The lobby is beautiful, check in was a breeze. We went to our room, which was on the ground floor facing the hotel next door. We weren't fans of the room, but we weren't in there much anyway. After we dropped our bags off, we went down the the huge beach and watched a storm roll in. There was a thunderstorm that night but the next day dawned bright and blue. Thirty degree days, extremely hot sun, mostly cloudless days were what we looked forward to the rest of the week. Apparently sometime after Hurricane Richard hit Belize, it dropped to a Tropical depression and missed us completely. The red flag was out on the lifeguard tower for most of the week, but the waves weren't too bad. Room: we requested a king bed, but were given a room with 2 doubles that the front desk said would be pushed together and made up as a king when we checked in. Housekeeping showed up about 2 hours later to do that. There is a sunken living room area with a flat screen satellite tv and a loveseat. The bathroom is very big with a his n hers sink, whirlpool tub/shower combo, and brand name amenities. Bring your own body wash as the stuff they have in the shower doesn't smell very good and is very watery. The bed is comfortable, at least for the Caribbean, and has 4 decent pillows. They also offer two heavy blankets which I loved because when you get burned from the intense sun, sometimes a sheet won't do. There is also an alarm clock in the room. Room service is included 24 hours a day, and it looked like it was a pretty decent menu, although we didn't order from it. Housekeeping didn't show up on day 3 at all, and day 4 our room didn't get made up until 6pm, after we hung our sign out. The first 2 days, no sign was required. Also, a maid showed up at 10PM to offer us one towel on the day our room hadn't been cleaned. Someone obviously came in on day 3 because our towels were gone, but nothing else was touched. The mini bar is stocked every day, but if you have your DO NOT DISTURB sign out when they come around, you won't get a restocked mini bar that day. There are bottles of water, Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, an Orange Crush type pop, and Dos Equis beer, plus a liquor dispenser offering Smirnoff Vodka, Jose Cuervo tequila, Bacardi white rum and some type of whisky. There is also a laptop sized safe in the closet for free and a coffee maker. The halls are tiled so sound really does echo. Suitcase wheels are particularly loud, and if you aren't an early riser, those and the maid carts will probably wake you early. Food: There are 4 a la cartes at this hotel, and a buffet. There is a Brazillian restaurant that we didn't eat in, a Japanese restaurant that we did eat in, a Steakhouse that we eat at, a Mexican restaurant that we did eat in, and a Gourmet restaurant that we didn't eat in. We've never eaten at a Japanese resturant before, so we thought we'd try it. They offer sushi which we sampled, and didn't really care for, warm and cold sake, chicken skewers and a salmon dish which we really enjoyed. For dessert they had fried ice cream which was pretty good. We ate at the Steakhouse our last night there at it was awful! We had the last seating at 8:30pm. We ordered our meal and then proceeded to wait for 35 minutes as everyone else received their salads and we did not. There weren't very many people at this seating and there were 4 waiters but they all seemed to running in chaotic circles, tending first to the groups of 4 or more. We flagged down our waiter as he was about to take the group of 5's order ( they'd already eaten their salad!) and he told us to wait a minute. We found this unacceptable as evryone around us was already finishing their appetizers. Finally, our salad came, followed almost immediately by our main course. We had the chicken which was a greasy leg and wing, not the breast we were expecting. We ordered vegetables with our chicken, but again, did not receive our vegetables until we flagged down the head waiter. Unlike the buffet wait staff, the steakhouse, which is the snack bar during the day, is very customer oriented. Before your glass is empty at the buffet, they are there to top you up. At the steakhouse, we waited with empty glasses for about 20 minutes. When this restaurant is the snack bar during the day, the wait staff is pretty good, and the food then is terrific. Not so good when the sun goes down. We ate at the Mexican restaurant, and it was very good. One of the head waiters is named Rosario and he is fantastic! You'll see him all over, but mostly at the buffet and the Japanese restaurants. The buffet is delicious. Fresh made to order omelette and scrambled egg stations, cooked bacon and sausage, fresh fruit, and a bunch of cereals are available. You have even have a mimosa or just plain champagne for breakfast. There are also 3 resort cats that tend to hang out at the buffet, but they don't beg and only come up to you if you dangle food for them. All in all, you won't starve on this vacation! Entertainment team: these people have the most energy I've ever seen. We caught a few night shows: the Grease show was predictable, the circus show was pretty good, and the tropical show was very much like watching a Victoria's Secret fashion show. The girls wear nothing but bras and thongs and sequins, and it is fairly sexually suggestive. They definitely work very hard and enjoy what they do. The guys you see around the resort from the entertainment team are very outgoing. They seem to be there from 10 am to 11pm. They'll play beach soccer, a game they call sexy bingo, and try to get you to join in the activities such as horse shoes, air rifle shooting, pool volleyball, etc. They also take you to Coco Bongo's which is a Vegas style show/bar in a group. Beach: The beach is gorgeous. The sand isn't as soft as other places we've been... there are a lot of shells, broken and intact, on this beach. There is an issue of irrosion of the beach, but this beach seems to be the best compared to further up or down. You can follow the beach for about 10 - 15 minutes and end up at 5th Ave, which is a huge shopping area. Keep in mind you will be bugged by all the store owners to come in, but a simple no thanks will do. The ferry to Cozumel is there too, so the people will ask if you want ferry tickets. We bought some things here, tshirts and hats are cheaper here than at the hotel. Bring your own snorkel. It is offered by the hotels, but it's $35USD to rent the snorkel equipment. We went out on the JetSki which was $65USD for 1/2 hour. It was pretty fun, since neither of us had ever done it before. You can go out on a Hobie cat if you know how to sail it, and if not, they'll teach you. I don't know if you have to pay... probably... cuz we didn't do it. There are also beach/pool waiters so you don't even have to get up. Just bring some tip money with you. Pool: The pool in huge! There is an infinity pool that tends to be the \"quieter\" pool: not so much splashing, very few kids, but attached to the \"main\" pool. There are tables in the pool for you to sit at while you drink. We found that the same people took up residence there for the entire day, and there are a couple of Jacuzzi type areas by the swim up bar. There are also loungers in the pool to lay on. The hotel doesn't allow saving lounge chairs, and we never really had an issue getting a lounger, again, probably due to the low occupancy. General information: if you need to call home, buy the phone card from the front desk. We bought ours on the reccommendation from our Sunquest rep from the plaza down the street. Apperently if you buy it from the front desk, they give you a discounted connection rate. We used the plaza bought card on the phone in our room and we had to pay $4USD each time we used it. There is free WIFI in the lobby, a 24hour sports bar with 2 pool tables and an arcade game. Don't lose the towel card they give you... it costs $30USD to replace it. We didn't have any problems booking our a la carte dinners, probably because the hotel wasn't full. All in all, we had a very pleasant stay. The weather was perfect; it rained pretty hard for about 10 minutes for 2 days but the sky cleared back up and the sun came out, and we got great tans. The drinks were plentiful, although I found that you need to specify if you want alcohol in your drinks. There are vendors that come to the resort 2 nights a week, selling jewelery, sunglasses, blankets, art, etc. Definitely barter with them. A reccommendation from our destination rep was offer 50% of their asking price to start. Change your money at a currency exchange or the banks in the area. You get a better exchange than at the hotel. But USD is widely accepted. The staff were, for the most part, terrific. I have never been somewhere before where the wait staff was this great, especially at the buffet. With the exception of the lousy dinner at the steakhouse, the food was divine. This seems to be more of a couples resort; there were groups of girls and some families, but mostly couples were here. Our rep was only okay. She did not let us know if we needed to pay a departure tax at the airport, didn't talk a whole lot about the excursions that we could go on, but she did give us our money back when the excursion operator changed the pick up location and failed to tell us or her. She said that the company said no to the refund because we were considered a \"no show\" but how can you show up if you don't know where the pick up is?

Positive - As we claimed that we are in a honeymoon they provided a free upgrade for a room with Ocean view, champagne and sweets. - Quality and Quantity of Food and Drinks are amazing. - Staff is excellent and very gentle, especially : Charlie / Santos (Pool Bar) , Angel (Entertainment), Omar (Reception) , Jeremias (Breakfast), Nicodemo (Lunch). - The variant restaurants. - Location and beach. - Extended check-out without any charge. Needs improvement - Cleaning services are making noise with the trolleys, which sometimes bother our sleep. - Internet is not available in the rooms, it is only provided in the lobby area with limited speed. - Pool bar is sometimes overcrowded. - 24h Room service is excellent, but the menu is limited. Some tips for the European travelers - Please be considered that if u use MARTINAIR which flies from Amsterdam, they easily charge for overweights. We were a couple with two luggage of 30kg+16kg which a little bit over the total of 40kg, but they charged us 100\u20ac since they claimed that they do not calculate with the average but each person separate. As the one luggage was 30kg, they claimed that we have to pay for the extra 10kg. It is pretty weird to do this since we fly with my wife for several years and all the time the companies calculate the average. Furthermore, when we left Athens the luggage had the same weight and they did not charge something to us. But as you are outside of the EU and with many souvenirs on your handbags, you do not have many options rather to stay quiet and pay. - If your Amsterdam is not your final destination and you have a transfer flight within the EU avoid to buy Drinks (tequila, rum etc.) from Duty Free in Cancun. The authorities in the Netherlands took the drinks, since during the transfer to the EU terminal we had a second handbags' check and during this check they claimed that the packing is not according to the EU regulation. So all of our drinks were left to the Netherlands.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cSun Camp 2010 Couldn't Have Been Better!!!\u201d", "Author": "jules40Georgia", "ReviewID": "UR85098608", "Content": "My husband and two other couples spent 7 days at the Riu Palace. This was the first time for all of us at Riviera Maya. My husband and I normally stay in Cancun at the Riu Palace Las Americas, but decided to try out this Riu for this year. We couldn't be more pleased with our decision. Check In - We took a private transfer from the airport to the resort. Traffic was horrible, but when we finally made it to the Riu I couldn't have been happier. Check in went without a hitch. We were actually early for check in, but our room was ready and the lady at the desk was very helpful. She gave us a map and told us where everything was. We were in our room changing into our bathing suits within 30 minutes of arriving. Room - I thought our room was a little smaller than those in Cancun, but my husband disagreed. Didn't matter though. We were there for the beach and pool. Our room was close to the the courtyard and where they entertainment performed most nights, but the noise didn't bother us. I can see where it would some people though. I do recommend you bring some type of house shoes because the floors are marble and very slippery. I had read that some people had a problem with a musty smell and was pro-active by bringing air fresheners. Pool - LOVED THE POOL AREA!!! Yes, we are some of those people that went out early and placed our belongings on chairs. If you didn't you sat in the shade all day. We loved the swim up bar and the tables in the pool. Charly, Moy, and Santos at the pool bar are amazing!! They work so hard. We tipped all our servers. Not for better service, but because they work so hard. Beach - The beach was awesome! Cancun's beach is horrible, so we were looking forward to this beach. We were not disappointed. Food - We ate at all the restaurants during our stay. Not a fan of the Brazilian or Krystal. I could have just eaten the salad bar at the Mexican restaurant. My favorite is the Japanese Restaurant. I had the beef filet in chili sauce and it was wonderful!! The buffet restaurant was always good with a great selection. Chili's for lunch was great too. I couldn't wait each day to see what soup they would have. The cauliflower soup was my favorite. Breakfast was excellent too. The fresh fruits, juices, breads, and cheeses were great. They truly try to put out a selection to please everyone. Entertainment - Angel, Leo, and the rest of the entertainment staff are great. They work hard and try to include everyone in all the activities. They truly helped us enjoy our stay. All six of us are very competitive and had a great time playing soccer, bocci ball, horse shoes, and water volleyball. We also enjoyed the shoes in the evening. By the end of our stay we decided that coming to the Rui would be an annual event for us.

From the time we arrived to the time we left there was nothing we could criticise - No nothing and we did not meet one pewrson who had a complaint and you do meet lots of nice people We where fortunate to be allocated a room over looking the court yard , 1 x very large double bed , optics and a fridge filled daily ,daily maid service, Jacuzzi in the bath / shower, double wash basin \u2013 enough wardrobe and cupboards for 6 peoples clothing, TV and 24 hr room service. Enough space to have a party, what more would you want? The service through out the hotel was First class where the waiters / waitresses bent over back wards to \"make your \" holiday. Yes they are wanting a tip (to subsidise their pathetic weekly wage) and I do believe in typing good service. The food and the several Ala carte restaurants were tremendous. In the main self service restaurant, the selection from the buffet was the best we have ever seen and if you said you could not find anything to eat \u2013 get a life!. We loved the Japanese restaurant with the wonderful dishes (Its amusing watching Americans using chop sticks for the first time sorry Americans but it was so funny). What hotel would offer a guided tour round all their kitchens, it was very interesting and I think that says it all - regards to their confidence and standards through out There are 4 Bars ( All branded spirits ). The pool bat opens 10am \u2013 6pm, (2 x swimming pools) were the drinks are continuously offered every minute of the day by the hard working staff.( Dont feel you have to tip evey timne they serve you). The Sports bar \u2013 Fun but it gets smokey from time to time \u2013 open 24/7 and they have sandwiches etc available 24/7, the bar attached to the main restaurants \u2013 no problems where you would sit and enjoy a drink whilst watching the in \u201chouse entertainment\u201d (The Entertainers tried very hard), that is if you wanted to be entertained. The lounge bar ( no smoking) with \u201cIslas\u201d as the head bar man \u2013 What a great guy with superb service. He makes you feel so welcome and is proud of \u201chis\u201d bar, with his professional service and wonderful cocktails. (Cocktails are drunk at every bar and Wow were they good). Please note \u2013 We saw no drunk\u2019s thugs, larger lots etc. - just nice friendly quests from all around the world The beach is clean and not crowded,the sea can be rough , you can walk and enter all the other Rui hotels around the area all within walking distance and have something to eat and drink (nor an evening meal though). We felt for standards service etc Rui Palace Riviera Maya was the best less crowded . Be careful when booking as some guests had booked the wrong Riu hotel. There is another older Riu hotel similar to ours that is 4 year older and layout is so similar. Try the local trips \u2013 Cheaper to book in Wal-Mart - \u00a32.50 away in a taxi. Walk or taxi into Playa del Carmen and barter with the locals, get a ferry to Cozumel different scenery, 30 minutes by small ferry (run regularly) No problems and do a little shopping and go off the beaten track and find the local shops and bars/restaurants at half the price In summary the hotel is one of the best we have every stayed in, the Mexicans are lovely people and are not out to \u201crip\u201d you off. Get talking to the locals and they are so friendly, yes they rely on the tourist industry, but so would you Switch off, chill out, there is nothing to do as such (but you can find lots of trips and things to do if you need it?) and watch how many superb cocktails you have.

We have never been to the area before. We just got back yesterday after a 6 night stay and we were extremely satisfied with this hotel and would not hestitate to return. We also walked around the immediate area and checked out the near-by hotels (including all the the Rius) and we felt that the Riu Palace Rivera was definitely the best (relatively speaking). Here's the low-down: Service -- The service is excellent! Hotel Room -- We had an upgraded room with a full frontal view of the ocean. Not many rooms have full frontal views of the ocean because of the layout. The room was nice and the furnishings were good. The only minior thing was that there were a number of misc. bugs popping up in the hotel room and around the area (hall, etc.). This didn't bother me too much, however, since it is the tropics and bugs are everywhere. I bet all hotels have this issue. Hotel Grounds -- The hotel grounds are meticulously maintained and very pretty. After checking out other hotels in the area we felt this hotel was definitely the best. Pool -- We never used the pool (always went to the beach instead) but it was relatively large and there were plenty of lounge chairs scattered about. There is a pool bar and music, pretty standard affair. Again, relatively to many of the hotels near-by we felt this pool looked the best. Beach -- The beach was great and this is where we spent most of our time. It's relatively wide and deep and there were always plenty of lounge chairs. When entering the water the first couple steps were a little rocky (actually sea shell fragments, not rocks) but after a couple steps it was sandbar. The beach was relatively consistent several hundred yards in either direction, with some areas with more/less shells and clearer/less clear water. There is a guy who comes around for drinks but it's very infrequent. You're better off going to the pool bar. Drinks -- The drinks were good. There are full bars with a full range of spirits for virtually any cocktail. The only beer available was Dos Equis which was unfortunate (not my favorite) and the wine is pretty limited as well. Food -- The food was much better than expected. We actually enjoyed eating at the buffet more than any of the speciality restaurants. The buffet had a really good selection of food for breakfast and dinner. There are several specialty restaurants and we tried the Mexican and Steakhouse. The Steakhouse (Chili's is it's name) was OK. If you're expecting a Morton's-style experience you will be disappointed but it was still good. The Steakhouse was definitely better than the Mexican restaurant (Aguave). Being from the southwestern US we have access to a lot fo good 'gringo' Mexican food and this restaurant was pretty disappointing for us. We just skipped the rest of the speciality restaurants and did the buffet the remainder of our stay. Entertainment -- Every evening there would be live music in the main courtyard, which was borderd by a large outdoor/indoor lounge and the buffet restaurant. The 5th Ave. area was also a 20-30 min walk or a $5 taxi ride from the hotel. This area has a lot of bars and restaurants. 5th Ave. is pretty American-ized but there are also some Mexican shops, as well.

Result. I can't really see any bad points but if I was being picky, the pool was a little crowded (some people tended to reserve the same sunbathing spots everyday which was meant to be forbidden!), Chilli's beach house wasn't so great at times and the entertainment could be a little bit samey and boring.....but these are all very small points. The good bits: 1) The service. The staff here are amazing. They remember your name, what drink you and your partner like, they carry your plate for you, they keep giving you more beer. Polite, courteous and always, always smiling. 2) The room. Not sure where all these damp comments are from as we never experienced that or any bad smells or anything. Bed was HUGE, maybe a king-size? Really comfy and the housekeeping were great and would restock the minibar nearly every day! 3) As mentioned, the minibar. Free 7-up, coke, water and bar-style optics with bacardi, brandy and vodka?? Did I mention it was all free??!! 4) The food. Chilli's was bad and I'm not being horrible on purpose, it gave us a bad belly but might have been a one off. Agave (Mexican) and Botafogo's (Brazilian) were BRILLIANT. Don Manolos Buffet was great and the themed nights always had a good selection of choice. Typical Brit though I had chips with everything!! We had room service on our hungover/lazy days and that was also quite good (turkey sandwich and chocolate cake? Of course Sir!) 5) Beach/pool. The pool wasn't crowded as some people have said, the sun loungers were. We found the pool was nice and empty which meant we had total privacy to mess about etc...The beach was great and the see was warm. Who cares if it was a little rocky? Youre on a paradise-style beach....who cares??

We had an absolutely great time! We have been loyal Riu followers over the years and we had stayed at the Riu Palace Punta Cana. I must say that once you go to one Riu you've pretty much seen them all. The setup,decor everything is exactly how it was in Punta Cana. Not complaining about that because its not much of a big deal. So what were the good aspects of the hotel? The Good points: 1.Great architecture and decor. Some people complained that the hotel decor was dark and didn't evoke a cheery Caribbean feel but I feel like that would have been in steep contrast with the overall design of the hotel. I felt at times like I was traveling in Europe especially at nights when we sat outside of the stage. 2.The selection of restaurants was great you weren't always stuck at the buffet although at times the buffet was better than some of the restaurants. 3.The service was stellar. Wither we tipped or not we received excellent service from the waiters, maids, bartenders and front desk. 4.The pool particularly the infinite pool was great. 5. The Beach was great in my opinion. Some complained about the sand erosion and the rocks. The beach is clean and really wavy which was lots of fun for us. The Mediocre 1. The entertainment was less than impressive. The Micheal Jackson was the only memorable show. 2. The Food, the food wasn't always great. We ate at the Japanese and Fushion Restaurant. The Japanese was okay, the sushi was pretty good and the tempura ice cream was really nice we asked for seconds. The buffet was okay sometimes the food was overly salty or cold. 3. The room. The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets smelt very moldy. It didn't matter too much as we hardly spent much time there. 4.The Distance from the airport. I believe it was about and 1 and 30 minute drive kind of a long distance after a 4 hour flight. The Bad 1.The Fushion Restaurant. This place was disgusting. The food was uneatable. None of it was good. I strongly do not recommend eating here. 2. Flies and ants. I am sure that we probably ate tons of ants and flies as they were always near the food and i did see ants crawling on my food and on the cups sometimes. CHECK your cups and cutlery to to make sure its clean. In all a great hotel 9 out of 10. Some things are out of control as you can't control the fact that there are bugs and that the food is sometimes cold. I recommend this place if your a family and or couple. Its not too much of a party place which is okay, i mean who wants to be surrounded by obnoxious drunk teenagers.

We travelled with 2 parents, 4 over 18's and two 15-12 year olds. The appeal was not needing to worry about finding a restaurant and spending the days trying to feed the boys, so the idea of all inclusive was very appealing. The RIU was gorgeous, the grounds are beautiful however at time the pool became almost overrun with loud people being encourgaged by the 'activities team.' As such i would recommend this resort to either groups of friends 20-40 who are wanting to have a good time as opposed to couples or people who are in search of a relaxing luxury hotel. The food at the buffets was generally quite nice, there was however a lack of seafood which would be very welcomed for lunch during the hot summer days. We were most disappointed with the reservations for the restaurants as we were staying 3 nights when we arrived we were told that either the restaurants were booked out for the next 3 nights and/or weren't opened. We did however manage to go to Krystal which was lovely. It was nice to eat a proper meal as opposed to buffet dining. The beef filet was especailly well cooked and would recommend this. The hotel was only a 20 minute walk into town or a $5 cab ride. The beach out front of the hotel was spacious and there was pleanty of sunbaking room and chairs set up. I am not sure if i would do an all inclusive again, especailly in Playa as there are so so many good restaurants in town which are all very reasonable. However the RIU was nice and FAR better than the RIU PLAYA DEL CARMEN - remember that the RIU PALACE RIVIERA MAYA is actaully closer to Play del Carmen than the Riu Playa del Carmen and newer.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau", "Title": "\u201cPleasurable\u201d", "Author": "PRobinson", "ReviewID": "UR81923479", "Content": "We have travelled to quite a few places in the Caribean and this trip was our 3rd visit to Mexico. We just love the friendliness of the people and the scenery and wide variety of attractions there is to do. However this year we did not chose the best time of year to go. As it turned out we were in the rainy season and had several days of heavy rain. Yet regardless of this it did not prevent ourselves from enjoying the trip. Even though it rained we still enjoyed the pool and its pool bar or the beach and the big waves. And when the sun did come out we enjoyed visiting 5th avenue for some shopping which has become a tradition of ours. And on another sunny day we visited the attraction Xplore which I will leave for a seperate review. As for this hotel the staff were very friendly. The hotel manager even upgraded our room for half the value that it would normally cost due to it being the low season. The drinks were fantastic which really made drinking them easier and it helped pass the time and forget about the bad weather. From our past experience hotels usually make the drinks too strong and they usually end up getting wasted. There was great intertainment and lots of activities to keep busy. The food however wasn't what I expected it was good but it was like it was missing the wow factor. The buffets had great varity, the a la carte restarants had good portions but yet the best meals we had while on the trip was when we ate outside on the hotel. Like a stake house on 5th avenue etc. The mattress on the bed was harder then we were use too and every morning both my wife and I woke up sore. As for the spa; my wife went for a pedicure and manicure which was very pricy for the lack of treatment she got out of it. And then I booked a stress cure treatment which she liked. And another thing that we were a bit dissappointed in was the fact that since this is a spanish chain or so I believe most of the people there spoke spanish which is understandable however even the activity staff would speak 3/4 in spanish and only 1/4 in english so it made it difficult to join in the activities. ( We got to learn spanish) So overall regardless of the down sides we still enjoyed this vacation and this hotel.

We went to this resort through Thomson first week of September. A great time to go! It was hot, sunny and humid with a few thunderstorms chucked in for good measure. We were not disappointed!!!!! This was my first time at an All inclusive resort and again I was stunned by the location, the service and standard. I have read umpteem negative reviews about this place and I was slightly skeptical what we would find. Through our tour operator, we arrived first on the transfer and rocked up to a real Palace! A stunning Riu the best out of 5 others on the resort. Check in was a breeze as we spoke Spanish and we were upgraded to a suite as it was our honeymoon. Yay! My husband who works in public health was also impressed with the cleaniless and standard of the hotel having inspected many substandard 5 star hotels in London. The staff speak Spanish as you are in a spanish speaking country so its only polite to give it a go!! But they also speak English and American. The pool and bars were amazing, the booze premium brands served and as an all inclusive if you wanted champagne in the middle of the night the house champagne came up with room service! Local grog was particularly potent!!! It also wasn't really busy by the pool so there was no towel reserving really and there was space for everyone. The beach was very clean, and the water was crystal clear. There were a variety of watersports included such as sailing, but we didnt get round to those! There entertainment program was quite amusing too! My husband did shooting and I did pool aerobics...gin and tonic in hand though! I have never experienced such amazing food. I am not a fussy eater or have any special dietary requirements and up for trying all things, but having a few fussy eaters in the family, I would imagine there would be something there for even the most picky of eaters. I'll be honest, you do hear dubious things about buffets so again I was slightly wary. However I thought the buffet at Don Manolo's was excellent and served better quality food than some of the 5 speciality a la carte restaurants. Especially as we were there on Mexican Independence Day there was a huge fiesta and the food was amazing. Ask for the traditional Habanera sauce if you want the really thing. I don't think I have ever eaten so much in my life!!!!!! The resort was hardly full, as we were slightly out of UK holiday time, there were hardly any children which was great for a honeymoon. This also meant that the resort was not busy and booking for the speciality restaurants was fairly easy. We'd pitch up at the bar from the pool at 11.45 grab another Gin and Tonic and wait for the bookings man. I imagine that in prime time reservations could be harder to ascertain, however we got our choices most of the time. The best restaurant I thought was Yashima the Japanese restaurant and the Krystal Fusion dining, but given a choice I would buffet it in the evening if there is a special fiesta on. It was really odd finishing dinner walking out with not paying the bill! The staff were all amazing from the waiters and waitresses, to the housekeeping staff and conierge. They are all friendly, polite and accomodating. Coming from a culture that doesn't normally tip, I didn't feel pressured into tip giving. I gave tips to staff who really deserved it, ie the guy who came down to our beach spot with countless drinks and the maid that cleaned our room. 50 pesos is about \u00a33.02 and we gave 20-30 pesos a time. We did plenty of excursions, one to Xel-Ha, this was to an aqua eco park. My only advice here is to buy your sunscreen once you get to the hotel. This Riu has a little convenience shop (and a nice Silver jewellry shop to boot) and stocks Biological suncream. All the eco parks ask that you have this, and not Nivea/Soltan/Banana Boat/Piz Buin as they contain certain chemicals. They give you a small packet of bio cream but I got really burnt, so don't be afraid to ask for more as they only give you one per couple at the start. On our last day we went to Chichen Itza, a Mayan/Tol Tec ancient city with the famous Mayan Calendar momument. Amazing. This was where the Mayans and Aztecs joined forces. We didn't get to Coba or Tulum, pure Mayan ruins. So I guess thats for next time! The resort is gated and completely safe. There are safes as standard in the rooms so use it, we did. We got taxis just because they were air conditioned into the local town Playacar. Well worth a venture out for dinner or a drink or two. We are planning to go again to the same hotel next year.

There are more Europeans (more courteous) than Americans that stay in playa which were prefer. Being American, we know how roudy some of us can be sometimes just want to get away from that. The workers there are the best, bending over backwards and always so friendly. The food was great, sure the cups are small so go to the local Walmart and buy a big cup. We did & they had no problem filling it up. The rooms smell musty? Of course they do, you're in the Yucatan where it's humid all year long, anywhere you stay it's going to be the same thing but hardly an issue. We loved seeing \"Islas\" at the Havana Bar and he's the best bartender always ready with a big smile and something refreshing. Sure tips are included but these folks work very hard to please you, throw a couple of bucks at them anyway. TIP: If you're going to Playa, it's best to get private transportation (Google it) for the same price. Playa is about an hour from the airport so if you take a shuttle that has other passengers, most likely you will be one of the last if not the last drop offs which can take almost 2hours to get to your hotel. Also do not book your trip with the ground transpostation or vacation reps who linger in the lobby. They are over-priced and you can haggle with the vendors in 5th avenue, trust me, there's A LOT of competition.

Personally, the smells of Mexico are the first thing I notice as I exit the plane ... and I love it!\" \"Things get stolen.\" No they don't. I always take 2-3 cameras, a cell phone, a PC and a dive computer; nothing has ever disappeared. \"The ocean was rough.\" I don't think this is Riu's fault. When we were there, half the days were rough seas and half were incredibly calm. You pays your money and you takes your chances. \"There's no nightlife at the hotel.\" Agree. If this is what you are looking for, this is not your best hotel. Personally, I prefer dancing with my baby under the stars to the gentle tunes played by the band that performs every night on the Riu patio--but I know this isn't everyone's preference.

After staying at a number of Riu's throughout Europe and the Caribbean, as well as the Riu Palace Las Americas in nearby Cancun, I was worried that this hotel would not be as good but the Riu Palace Riviera Maya is BETTER! Rooms - The rooms are very well equipped with everything that you could possibly need. We were given a deluxe suite with a beautiful view overlooking the fountains and pool area. Fantastic! Restaurants - The food was absolutely outstanding! The best food of any Riu that I've stayed at. The buffet restaurant was fantastic and the speciality restaurants were hit and miss. I'll go through each restaurant in turn: The main buffet restaurant - FANTASTIC! My family preferred eating in the buffet each night as the option of food was so phenomenal. Each night has a different theme e.g. Gala, International etc. Breakfast in here was also fantastic but we preferred lunch in Chilli's overlooking the beach. Brazillian restaurant - Didn't eat in here as we tried the same restaurant in the Riu Palace Las Americas and it wasn't for us. Mexican restaurant - It was okay. The starter is a buffet option but there was not enough food for all of the diners which proved to be a problem. The main meal had options such as fajitas which were great and overall the restaurant wasn't too bad. Krystal's Gourmet restaurant - This was probably our least favourite restaurant as the portions were TINY and my steak was not very good at all. However in saying that, we spoke to many other guests who said that Krystal's was their favourite restaurant so I'd recommend trying it for yourselves as you may like it. Chilli's Steakhouse restaurant - I can't comment on the food here. I sat down at my seat and then saw that cats were walking around the restaurant under the table as people were eating etc. I don't like cats so I got up and left. It was a shame because the steakhouse at the Riu Palace Las Americas was my favourite restaurant in that hotel so I was disappointed not to have tried the one in the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. The cats are not a problem in Chilli's of a day (I never saw any). Japanese Restaurant - This was our favourite speciality restaurant. The first course is a sushi board and the starter is an option of tempura prawns, pasta etc. The tempura was fantastic! I had a main meal of steak which was great . I'd definitely recommend this restaurant! Bar service - The day bar service was fantastic. A special thanks to our barman Charlie who never once walked past without offering us a drink. He remembers the drink you like and made our holiday incredibly relaxing! Beach and pool area - The pool area is beautiful and everytime you look around, the staff are cleaning the pool, the fountains and the floor. The area is just stunning! I previously stayed at the Riu Palace Las Americas which had a nice but very small beach due to hurricane damage. The beach at Riu Palace Riviera Maya was huge and beautiful. Yes there are waves and on 2 days the ocean was too rough to swim in but for the other 12 days, the ocean was lovely. Location - The Riu Palace Riviera Maya is located within a gated community called Playacar. I cannot express how safe this resort is for tourists staying here! Even the cab drivers have to give their driver's licence to the security men as they enter and do not get them back again until they leave. It is approx a 25 minute walk to the resort of Playa Del Carmen or 5 minutes in a cab (a cab costs $5 from Riu Palace Riviera Maya). After looking at the other Riu's in the area, we definitely chose the best hotel. The Riu Palace Riviera Maya is MUCH nicer than the Riu Palace Mexico which appeared to be empty both times we visited the hotel. We had lunch in the Riu Palace Mexico one day and was not impressed (small food option). I can't wait to return to Mexico and when I do, I will be returning to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bingley", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JaggersBingley", "ReviewID": "UR79128543", "Content": "We travelled to this fabulous hotel in August this year and were not disappointed. I had my reservations going in the hurricane season, but I was not to worry. There were storms, some of them spectacular, but they soon blew over. I did struggle with the humidity during our stay and often found myself sitting in the lobby bar to cool off. As with some other reports, I will provide an honest reflection of our stay, including the pro's and con's. The hotel is magnificent and very grand. The bedrooms are not what I would class as a 5*, more like a 4*, but the rest of the hotel lives up to its rating. The pool area is spotlessly clean and the staff are excellent in all parts of the hotel, they cannot do enough for you. Our best part of the holiday was the 'speciality restaurants' (the main restaurant is equally as excellent). These are all fantastic, with Krystal, the fine dining, being the best by far. It is a little bit of a pain having to queue everyday to get your reservation in, but definitely worth it. Now the downside. Trying to get into the more popular restaurants is very difficult and quite often you find yourself with the 6.30 sitting (this is OK for us as we have children). What frustrated both myself and my husband was that there were tables free when we were at our sitting. When I queried this, I was told, 'they simply have not turned up'. This, to me, is not acceptable as they could have filled those tables ten times over. I think they need a different system in place to stop this. The beach is beautiful and the kids loved the free use of the boards and went surfing in the morning waves. Now to the alcohol. The saying 'you don't get if you don't ask' is very true here. If you want a gordon's G&T ask for it, otherwise you will be palmed off with a cheap variety that is not very pleasant. The drinks are not very alcholic around the pool, which is probably a good thing because if you drank them all day you would regret it, I am sure. Being a lover of nice wine, I was disappointed that you were not given the option to purchase a wine of your choosing. The wine was acceptable, but not brilliant and I stuck to the red most times as this better than the white. This is something that I would not normally do. Tip - if you tip the staff, you get stronger drinks!! We went on two excusions, Xcaret and swimming with turtles. Both were very good and would recommend them. Tip - keep you air conditioning in your room on low all the time and shut your wardrobes. Because the humidity is excessive, if you don't, your clothes can soon get damp. There is mentioned on other reports about a strange smell around the hotel. We also found this and discovered that it was part of the cleaning fluid. The only place I smelt it was in the lobby bar area, following a clean. Would recommend this hotel. If you don't like thunderstorms and are freaked out by large lizards (everywhere in xcaret), smaller ones in the bushes around the hotel, then this is not for you.

Both trips we had before this one, we were very happy, and we're not that hard to please. So since you are all reading this trying to figure out where to stay on your next trip, I'll cut to the chase. Location- Very good, as are a lot of hotels in the Playacar area. 8 minute walk to ferry docks down a very safe, secure beach. All good. Beach- Very good as well, as you may not know, the Mexican government spent over 70 Million rebuilding all the beaches from here to Cancun. The only complaint is........the water wasn't very clear within 100 yards of the beach. When they put the new sand down, the ocean has churned it all up, over and over again, so although the water looks very nice from the shore, it is full of \"free sand.\" It's not an issue to swim in, just don't expect to see your feet when you are in the water. Other places 10 minutes away from our resort where they didn't re-do the beach was crystal clear. Rooms- Here's where we were let down. Yes, they do look nice in their pictures, but the reviews that I didn't believe were true. THEY WERE DAMP AS HELL!!!!!!!!!! Disappointed to say the least. When we flew home to Edmonton and opened our suit cases, they were musky, and stinky. We took every piece of cloths we had and laid it out to dry out. The room absolutely stunk the next morning. It took a few washes to get the smell out. They have no de-hummidifier at this resort. The sheets were damp in our room. Uncomfortably damp to say the least. We never experienced this any where else. Like our last stay at the Royal Playa Del Carmen. If you want perfection, go there. it was unbelievable. They were full when we booked this, so we couldn't go there. It is a big step up from this place in every way. Well worth the extra couple of bucks. Btw, they shut off the hot water boilers late ate night, so if you have an early excursion, there's no hot water at 7am. Service- The service was pretty good. I think the Mexicans do a very good job at trying to please, no matter where you stay. The service was better at the RPDC, but it was decent here. Although, 1 day, housekeeping never even cleaned our room, and I swear we slept on the same sheets for the 8 nights we were there. Disappointed once again. Food- The run of the mill buffet. Nothing special. The same thing every day, over and over, and over again. We did one a la carte, OMG it was a joke. My steak was about 3oz. I'm 255 lbs, so I could have eaten 4 of them. Once again, disappointed. It was no RPDC. Would I go back?? No definitely not. This place is a weak 4 star at best, who are they kidding. We wanted a 5 star, and paid for a 5 star. From the decor, to the so called gym it was just a step below what we wanted, and we are not rich people. We are your run of the mill, middle class, late 30's Canadians. I would go back to the RPDC in a heart beat. We walked through the Playacar Place (big white one by the ferry docks) and it looked very nice as well. It's right next to senior frogs.

Probably, but only for 4 nights. Our trip of 7 nights felt too long and there was not much to do besides sit at the pool or beach. I stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya from 8/10-8/17 with my husband. We booked through Expedia and got a good deal. Beware of Expedia and make sure you pick your seats on the airline through the airline and do not believe what Expedia tells you. The shuttle that we booked through Exepedia- Best Day- was convenient and at the airport waiting for us upon arrival. However, Best Day tells you to meet a representative in the hotel lobby at a certain time the day you get there to pick up a voucher for the return shuttle. This is a scam, as they try to book additional excursions with you. We know this because we forgot to visit with their rep the day we got there and someone called us by 8am for the next 2 days to remind us to \"pick up our voucher\" even after we did. We happened to book an excursion through \"Hotelbeds\" prior to meeting with the rep from Best Day, who, when he found out we booked through Hotelbeds, claimed that we are his \"people\" and had an argument in Spanish (without knowing I understood) with the Hotelbeds rep that she should not have booked our tour and that she stole his customers. The unprofessionalism was rampant and put us in a very awkward position. He asked us to bring him the ticket so that he can rebook the excursion with his company. In the end, we went with our original rep from Hotelbeds, but we were quite uncomfortable. Now on to information about the hotel. We we arrived, we were given a room with a king bed with an awful view of a grassy area and a factory. We immediately asked for a change, which the front desk granted. This new room had a courtyard view with a very large balcony. However, it only had double beds. They said they can push the 2 beds together and remake the linens and it would be fine. In fact, it was. The bed was huge but worked out well. The room (2088) was quite pretty. However, we saw many cockroaches which was disgusting. The toilet also stuffed 3 times in one week. While the room did not smell while we were there, my clothing \"reeked\" when I came home and everything had to be washed. We did not have a problem with humidity in the room. Air conditioning was adequate. The hotel grounds are beautiful and well manicured. We would constantly see workers cleaning, pruning, watering, etc. The service was impeccable. We were always greeted and the service was truly with a smile. While I would lay out in a lounge chair the waiters would be hustling to bring us drinks. I did tip every once in a while, but it certainly was not expected or necessary. We just saw how hard they were working and we felt it was nice to give a bit of appreciation. The hotel itself was very safe and the area of Playacar felt safe as well, being that it is gated in. We went out to Playa del Carmen by taking a $5 cab ride. I felt fine, but my husband was concerned while walking around as he was offered \"illegal\" things by the locals. The food was good. We ate breakfast at the buffet and there was a nice spread, rivaling what I have seen on a Celebrity or Royal Caribbean cruise. After a week, we did get bored though. For dinner, we tried 3 of the 5 specialty restaurants, with Krystal being the best. It rivaled the food served at top restaurants in NYC. We had this one waiter named Daniel who went above and beyond. He was only 17 years old. The Japanese was ok, but if I was served their food in NY and paid for it, I would have been disappointed. Chili's was disappointing as well with very limited choices on the menu. How they could ruin a Baked Alaska is beyond me. The buffet was good, but we did get bored with the selection after a few days. Both my husband and I got sick the last day and it lasted about 5 days after we came home. We had diarrhea, sore throat, cough and cold. We did not eat any raw foods (ie, salads or fruit). While on our tour, the tour guide was coughing and sneezing and we think we got sick from him. We did eat food and drink water on a Mayan Encounter (that we booked through Hotelbeds). They said that everything was purified and safe to eat (\"how can we serve you something that would make you sick? No one would come on our tours!), but now I don't believe them. I think the hotel on the surface looks spotless and clean. However, one should note that at the buffet, the servers do not change the tablecloths between guests and if you come towards the end of the seating hours, there are stains and crumbs on the tablecloths. When I pointed this out to the waiter, they told us to switch tables. It was hard to find a table that was not used already. I am a nut about clean silverware and I don't think I ever found a dirty plate or piece of silverware. One point for the dishwasher! If you love to snorkel, beware that the hotel is not situated on or near a reef. We brought our own snorkel gear but still had to take a snorkel tour. We took on for $35 a person from the company right on the beach, but the boat was so small and the water was choppy, that I ended up throwing up and needless to say, did not enjoy it at all. Overall, if you are looking for a week of pure relaxation, pretty surroundings and decent food, this is a great hotel to go to. You will be catered to. Like I said, 7 nights was a bit too much. We would have been just as happy with 4 or 5 nights.

On arrival at Cancun airport after an 8 hour delay and an 11 and a 1/2 hour flight flight due to the Volcano, we then took a further hour to get through immigration which is really a shambles, then after a further hour and a half coach trip we arrived at our hotel. The hotel is beautiful very similar in appearance to the Riu Palace Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, we stayed there last year so found everything easy to find as its all in the same places. After such a long trip plus arriving at 01:30 we checked in and were allocated our room directly above the 24hr sports bar our friends had the mirror image room on the other side of the hotel both with a view of a tiled roof and the walls of the reception area. My friends and I both asked if it would be possible to move from these rooms as we had paid a lot of money and did not fancy 2 weeks of looking at this view. The night receptionist was very helpful and said that although he could not move us at this time because there were no other rooms available he would pass it on to his boss in the morning and try to get us a better room. So the next morning we went to reception and sure enough he had been as good as his word and we were both offered a change of room but told if we could wait another 24hrs they would be able to offer us an upgrade free of charge. We agreed and the next morning my friends were moved to a courtyard view suite and we were given a full ocean view suite, well worth the wait and much appreciated. Anyway the rooms were now very nice with great views, spotlessly clean with king sized beds a good selection of drinks both on optics and in the refrigerator. The standard of the rooms were kept up by the maids who were constantly cleaning and replacing used towels plus making towel sculptures. (don't know how they found time) The hotel and Grounds were very well maintained and as Playacar is a Gated community with security it is a very safe place and you are able to walk out to the other RIU hotels at night most nights we walked back after midnight then spent time in the sports bar with very friendly staff mainly Victor & Noe who both work very hard and make great drinks. If you meet them give them a tip now and again it won't change the service but it will make a difference to them. We found all the staff very pleasant and very helpful. The Pool area is very nice with a pool bar and waiter service both around the pool and on the beach which is nearby. The speciality dining, Mexican we really enjoyed good service, good choice and good food, The Brazilian was funny but not good and we walked out of the Steak House due to both poor food and service also there was no choice on the starter course you just got the salad and seafood. The Buffet restaurant however was superb both for breakfast and evening meal and it was a pleasure to eat here. The service and drinks were good in all of the bars but be sure to ask for brand names or you will be served local spirits. The beach and the sea are nice but the sand is coarse with a lot of broken coral and shells in it so it's best to wear footwear there are plenty of sunbeds and even hammocks on the beach. We used all the other RIU hotels including the ones in Cancun (you can eat and drink in these too during the day and night ) but this was the best of them all. It was nice to get about and Playa Del Carmen is only about 15-20 minutes walk away either by beach or follow the road turning right from the front of the hotel or a short 5 dollar Taxi ride. From Playa Del Carmen it is possible to catch an air conditioned coach to downtown Cancun for 7 dollars return (approx every 10 minutes) from there you can catch a bus for less than a dollar to the hotel zone and shopping malls, we did its safe and quite easy. As we have been to Mexico before and done the trips that we wanted we only went to the Captain Hook Pirate trip in Cancun which was excellent entertainment and the best Steak and Lobster of the holiday well worth the money. The entertainment in the hotel is the same as all the other local RIU hotels not really that good but they do try. We had a few nights when it rained, if you wanted to go out you only had to ask at reception and they provided an Umbrella. We met some nice people of different nationalities and really enjoyed our holiday after a ropey start and would certainly return here but it would be nice if more effort could be made with the speciality restaurants (they used to be better) and the entertainment then this hotel would be perfect.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolton", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel - Fantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "jokell", "ReviewID": "UR77189545", "Content": "Stayed here between 8-22 Aug 2010 for two weeks with husband and two kids aged 11 and 7.

Our room was cleaned every day by Jacobob and was immaculate and there was always a special surprise awaiting the kids everytime we got back the room in the shape of teddies, animals or flowers made up from towels which the kids loved. The only complaint about the room was the layout of the beds as it was two double beds pushed together and that was were we all slept, not much privacy, would have been better if a double sofa bed was put in the living area, luckily our kids are still youngish but with older kids its worth thinking about getting connecting rooms.

Tours: We paid $80USD for a snorkeling trip on a catamaran that took us out, provided us lunch and took us to a private beach in Cozumel. The beach there was absolutely beautiful! Well worth the money! Although we did, yes we did, encounter a SHARK! but the staff quickly pulled the catamaran up to the group and pulled us in. We paid $50 USD each for a private van and staff to take us party hopping in Cancun. Well WORTH IT as a taxi to Cancun would have been $50 anyways. Our groups choose your own adventure trip consisted of us going to Playa del Carmen and taking the bus to Tulum. The local bus was only $1USD back then and entrance fee to tulum was $9USD? It was crazy hot there, but the beach they had at Tulum was to die for! sooo beautiful! We took a collectivo back to the resort for only $2USD!. In all for that trip to Tulum only cost $12 USD whereas Sunquest was charging $90 USD!! Beach: Beautiful.. calm clear blue waters, where you can see your toes even far out! The town of Playa del Carmen was only a 5 min drive from the hotel or $5 USD we paid for a cab. we went out to eat for my husbands birthday at a restaurant there (forgot the name). food was good.

There were 9 of us - 6 adults and 3 kids (8, 4 and 3). I have included some comments from a Mum's point of view as there arent too many on the reviews here. We had a few days of bad weather but the entertainment staff set up some indoor activities (ie casino, games for kids) so at least there is something to do. The first day we spent a lovely day at the Lobby Bar while the men were in the Sports Bar watching football and the two boys were at the kids club. Unfortunately the boys didnt really like the kids club. I think the problem was possibly due to them not being able to understand the lady who runs it (coupled with them being Mummy's boys!). They did take part in the kids disco which was on in the Lirico Lounge every night form 8.30 to 9. This consisted of dancing and a variety of games each night (musical statues, a pinata and a fashion show). We just cant get that song out of our heads now (Ch-ch-wa, Ch-ch-wa, Ch-ch-wa-wa-wa - anyone know what it is??). I have to say that the Entertainment staff work so hard. There are plenty of activities going on every day, or you can just laze by the pool. We did the water aerobics most days and it was really good fun. It was nice to meet people from different places as there werent too many Brits there (although we did go just before the start of the Scottish school holidays). The guests were mostly from the USA but we also met people from Argentina, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Mexico and of course Scotland. The pool area is always busy and has a good atmosphere. There is always something going on like aerobics, water volleyball, bingo and quizzes round the pool. The Kids Pool is a bit of a joke - its the size of a paddling pool! All the staff in the hotel are really friendly. You dont have to tip but it does secure a wee bit of a better service. We tipped one of the waiters on the first day and he came up with loads of drinks that we hadnt even ordered including shots and tequila slammers (never again!). The hotel is very safe for kids and we didnt have to worry about the boys sitting in the bar on their own (obviously within our sight) even though they are only 3 and 4. The waiters kept them going with drinks all night and I think they felt very grown up! Only slight complaint is that there wasnt a great deal of a selection of food for kids. Ours mostly ate pizza, bread rolls and ice cream for 2 weeks! I've read loads of reviews where people complain. Yes the drinks may not be that strong in the cocktails - so ask for more alcohol! Yes there is sometimes a musty smell in the rooms but that is probably down to the maids leaving the door open while cleaning the rooms and the air-con being left on. Yes it is over an hour from the airport - so read the brochure before you go and book somewhere closer!! Basically you cant please everyone!

However, the front desk staff handed us our fruity beverage and we spent no more than 3 minutes checking in. Was so easy I was shocked. My advice... pay for a private transfer to and from the airport/hotel. We booked thru FunJet, it was maybe another $50/person. So worth it. Our 45/55 minutes of driving was only driving, no stopping at other hotels. Room: Our room was pretty basic. It wasn't bad and it wasn't anything special. We were on the 3rd floor over looking the Plaza. We were over the theater but never heard any noise from it. Yes, the halls were a little loud but it's a hotel - lots of people. One plus to our room - we had a cement instead of a wrought iron wall to our balcony. Was nice to have the extra privacy. Was bummed, we only received one towel animal on the first night. BEWARE: The floor in the bathroom can get VERY slippery, put a towel down. Mini Bar: We left a tip right away and asked for lots of water and beer. Was filled with water every day. To my surprise, we barely drank the beer and never touched the liquor dispensers. The Bed: was firm. It wasn't unmanageable, I didn't wake up sore at all. We did not have 2 beds pushed together, ours was a true king size. The Musty Odor... after a couple of days of us \"living\" in the room, yes it did get musty. Wet swim suits, wet towels, sweaty clothes (REALLY HOT when we were there), started to get musty. I turned the fan on and opened the balcony door before we left for town. The maid came in, cleaned, closed the door so the air was back on and the smell was gone. My clothes were not ruined when I came home due to any smell. I washed them, dried them, all back to normal. Location: We did walk to and from Playa del Carmen almost every other day. It's maybe a 15 minute stroll. It was VERY hot when we were there - take water with you. If you prefer to take a taxi it really is $5US or 50 Pecos either way. No bartering, no other amount was ever asked. There were always taxi's readily available at the hotel, just ask the bellhop. In town, they are everywhere. Food: We ate, and ate and ate. The buffets in the main dining hall were always good, presented well and plentiful. There are healthy options to choose from. Lunch at Chili's was our standard, which we enjoyed. We did have dinner at Chili's (the lamb was amazing!) and the Sushi restaurant, we enjoyed both very much. The food that you can take at any time from the Sportsbar was our savior on more than 1 occasion, was almost 2am when we got back from Playa! Sandwiches, fruit was always fresh. The night that we ate at the Sushi restaurant, the main buffet had a Grand Gala (can't remember the exact name, check the board outside of the door). We were sad that we missed it as it looked spectacular! Drinks: I have a really hard time believing that the liquor is watered down. Even if it is, that's not necessarily a bad thing. When the staff is bringing each of you 2 drinks at a time (Happy Hour, even at 10am), every 10 minutes - watered down could be a good thing. Please whatever you do - order Mimosa's at breakfast. They were a great way to start the day! Try a Dirty Monkey for an after lunch drink and a Martini before dinner at the lobby bar - they make a REALLY good Cosmo. The wine... I'm by no means a wine connoisseur however, it is my drink of choice. It took me many tries to be able to drink the wine... If you must, ask for the Chilean wines first. The white was palatable to me. Staff: Was the most amazing part of the entire trip. The waiters, line cooks, bartenders, servers were all friendly, quick and 75% of them spoke wonderful English. They all seemed to enjoy their job and we got to know some of them as they are there 6 days a week usually for 12 hours or more. It was amazing that they saw us coming and always had a smile, Hola! and usually a drink or a seat at a table. Chairs were always pulled out for me, plates always cleared. We did tip but seriously, we would watch people from the staff from breakfast thru the night time show. They change outfits and keep working! Entertainment: I didn't come to this hotel for the entertainment - Playa is so close if that's what you're looking for. However, we did watch the show a couple of nights. We saw the Crazy Show - hilarious and Grease - was good! One night they were setting up for a circus act and had a huge trapeze in the courtyard but that was a night out at Playa so didn't see the show. The entertainment during the day was just as good. They definitely keep the crowd busy. I didn't partake in the aerobics, dance lessons, shooting range, Spanish lessons (I could go on) but there was something to do all day long... The entertainment staff also got to know the guests as they stayed. I watched them approach guests and greet them in their native language - they never got it wrong. We were there during 2 of the FIFA games featuring Mexico. WOW! Being from the US I didn't realize how big, cool this event was! The entertainment staff REALLY got into that, Mexico won and they ran thru the hotel screaming. Got me excited about a sport I know nothing about. We ended up watch the rest of the games at home! The Pool: Our daily routine was breakfast, 2 Mimosa's (Happy Hour), back to the room to change and then pool! We usually got there about 10am, traded in our towel cards and found 2 seats. Not sure who is having a hard time finding seats. Some times we were right next to the pool, some times we were 10 feet away under the palm trees. We were always able to find a mix of sun (him) and shade (me) either under an umbrella or tree. The pool always seemed clean. I didn't notice any straws, limes etc floating in the pool. The staff works hard to keep it clean. BEWARE: Don't try to walk on the cement with out sandals! It's SO hot you will get burned. And it happens fast. Fitness Area: So I work out, yeah... I walked in and there were 2 marathon runners pounding the treadmills. So I stretched and made my way to the elliptical machine to do my 20 minutes (what does that burn a whole 100 calories?) Fortunately for me, it wasn't working. So I settled for the recumbent bike, worked fine. They had the windows open in the fitness center and it was HOT. I did my 20 minutes and didn't realize that it must have been 110% humidity. I almost passed out on the way back to the room as I couldn't catch my breathe. Really, I do work out but wow! Fitness center was clean and available. After that episode I choose to do yoga (brought my own mat) and lift weights (substituted full large water bottles) on the private balcony. Dress code: This took me a little getting used to... They have a very strict dress code at the restaurants. Ladies always have to put a cover-up on over a swim suit, Men need to have some kind of shirt on at Chili's for lunch/snack. And they don't allow wet swim suits in the main buffet. I saw a couple of people that were asked to change before coming into the Sushi restaurant. I got the feeling I wasn't supposed to be walking thru the main lobby with shorts/swim top (I was heading to the pool). So I assimilated, not a big deal. All in all, I would go back to this hotel again in a heartbeat. In fact we're already planning on going back next year and I highly doubt I'll look at any other hotels.

This is a very luxurious resort. the staff cannot do enough for you. Prior to the visit i had read on Trip Advsior that all Thomson guests get put into rooms with less of a view - therefore at check-in I requested a special room as during the stay was my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary (not a fib). We were put in a room which did have a view over La Plaza and the Habana bar - this was a good position as it was near to the restaurant/lobby and within easy distance of the pools, the only slight downside to this was the room was over the Sport Bar which probably accounted for the 'movement of furniture' sound sometimes - again not an issue. The turndown service at night was a bit hit and miss, but nothing to whinge about -as we tipped at the end of the holiday - maybe different if tipped earlier on. Good location - within easy reach of Playa Del Carmen - a nice morning walk along the beach to the Cozumel ferry. Unfortunately, the weather was unkind in parts - 6 days of full on tropical rain - this didn't spoil the holiday - you just prop up the bar for a little longer!!!! We visited the other Rius in the area - Tequilla for the disco. The evening entertainment in the RPRM is mostly average, with the odd very good - although when the acts finish it would be nice to have a live band or at least some form of a disco. Free WIFI in the lobby is great. The daily entertaiment by the animation team is good. We did eat at all restaurants; Krystal is by far the best, the Japanese next, with the lesser restaurants being the Mexican and the Brazilian. The food in the buffet was of the highest standard we have ever experienced in an all inclusive and we have chosen this type of holiday in the Caribbean for the last 15 years. Outside of the hotel - very safe to walk, never felt under threat. The Mexicans are a wonderful, lovely natiion of people. We have previously visited Xel-ha, Xcaret, Chichen-Itza which are all worthwhile, this time we visited Explor - the park with the zip lines - what a fantastic, full, adventurous day. The ticket was booked through the rep and included all soft drinks and food all day.

We were there for an entire week and had a great time. The first couple days we just hung out by the pool and ate at the buffet. We then made reservations for 3 nights at 3 different restaurants. You can make reservations up to 2 at a time and 3 days in advance. Since we were traveling with another couple they made 2 and we made 1. We did this for 2 days in a row to make sure we hit all 5 restaurants. We were there right at noon and had no problem getting reservations. The japanese was excellent. The service was great and we had a great meal. The brasilian restaurant was okay. Probably the lesser of them all. The meat was cut very small portions and it wasn't very good. But it might just have been our taste. The best restaurant overall I think was Krystal (fusion). It was good food and it was different from anything I have had before. The buffet was great too. A lot of selection and the food was always good. The overall service was excellent. There was always someone, usually more than 1 person, waiting to get you something and make your meal enjoyable. Pulling your chair out for you, collecting your dirty plates within seconds of finishing etc. Our room was good. It was always cleaned by right after lunch. We got turndown service with little towel animals most of the nights. The bed was a bit uncomfortalbe but I am also a very light sleeper and don't sleep well in most beds but my own. We did have to get up by about 8am to get seats at the pool. The pool was pretty busy but it's big enough that you don't run into a lot of people. The water aerobics were entertaining around 12pm. We did a snorkeling tour with mayan adventures 1 days and it was a lot of fun. Different than expected but it was fun. My two complaints are that it is a ways from the airport. After a long day of traveling we still had another 1 1/2 hour ride to the hotel. Also, it would be nice to have more activities during the day/night. After the show there was not much to do except sit and drink at the bar. We didn't venture out to the other RIUs because there was no shuttle and we didn't feel like walking.

We all had a great time. Below is a 100% honest review of the hotel & the area. Upon arrival, we were greeted with fruity drinks and given a map of the hotel and grounds at the front desk. Our bags were promptly taken to our room. We had a junior suite facing in towards the grounds and it was beautiful. Very clean. I can only say that the some parts of the bathroom, such as the mirror and inside of the shower, were a little dated and could use some sprucing up. Also, the beds were a little hard for our taste. None of us experienced a musty smell that some other reviews talked about. Our room was cleaned everyday, however we did not receive the turn-down service every night, I'd say only 2 nights we received it. But we did tip our maid for the week the very last day and not every day during the week, so that may be why. The restaurants were excellent. We ate at each one of them and it was nice because eating at the buffet every day is just too much. When you're inside the restaurants, you really feel like you're in another place so it definitely is a nice change. We loved the japanese and brazilian place the best. As for making reservations, yes there was a line, depending on what time you got there. If you get there a little before 12 pm, you'll probably wait in line for 15 minutes the most. It just depends what time and how many people are waiting that day. You can make reservations for two days in advance. I honestly did not have a problem with the reservation system. We liked that the Riu hotels were in their own private community. We did visit the other Riu properties and had a drink at their bar, saw a show in the Riu Mexico, and went to the disco at the Riu tequila for a little bit. The drinks are a bit watered down, but it's nothing a small tip and a request can't change. We did go downtown to shop two different days. A cab into town was 5$ and there were tons of shopping, restaurants, people watching to do. A key to shopping down there is to BARGAIN! Don't accept prices of the first offer, they will lower them when you bargain. As for day trips, we went to Xel-Ha and Tulum. Xel-ha is absolutely amazing, it's a natural aquarium where you can snorkel, cliff jump, swim, eat, etc. We paid 100$ for the day which included round-trip transfers, unlimited food & drinks, snorkeling equipment, and admission. It really is a good deal and an unforgettable experience. They also have other activities, like swimming with dolphins, for an additional fee. The Mayan Ruins at Tulum is definitely a sigh to see as well. We had a wonderful, relaxing vacation. The hotel does have some minor flaws, but overall, the staff is more than accommodating to each guest's special request and needs. We were always asked if we needed anything, another drink, etc..everyone was very friendly. I definitely recommend this hotel for couples and families looking for a beautiful, all-inclusive hotel in the Riviera Maya.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "ilkley1", "Title": "\u201cIf you like 3 star Hotels with Watered Down Alcohol, choose this one\u201d", "Author": "Ilkley1", "ReviewID": "UR69443959", "Content": "My wife and I returned only yesterday from a 10 day stay at this Hotel. We were in all, very disappointed with the hotel in general and certainly will not be returning. On paper the hotel ticks all the boxes, however in reality, when you look closer, you see its not all its cracked up to be. eg. when you look at the actual construction of the hotel, it appears to have been built 'one the cheap'. I am from the building trade and noticed such things as the tiling was not even flat, flush wherever it was outside the main lobby, especially in your bathroom, pool, spa areas. The bathroom was cheap and poorly designed also, the spa bath (which smelt when used) was recessed within 3.5 walls, this ment that it was very dark and dinghy, especially whilst using the shower. The rooms certainly had a musty odour, similiar to wet dog! Our clothes on our return needed washing, regardless whether they have been worn or not. Additionally the noise from the corridors was very loud, You could hear everything which happened here and it woke both of us up on a number of occasions. The alcohol from the beer, to the bars, to the optics are ALL WATERED DOWN. You will never see a fresh bottle opened when you are there. If you look into the room servicing the 'Habana' Bar, you can see various spirits with corks in them. If ever your optics were changed they would simply take the bottle out of the room and return with a fuller bottle. Considering the largest majority of people staying at the hotel were american, you would expect a reasonable understanding of english, unfortunately this bore some frustration. Both our and our next door neighbours had problems with our room keys. The battery kept failing and the only way to then get access into your room is for the serviceman to gain access through your neighbours room, climb over the balcony and break into your room from the patio, which is reassuring! The buffet evening meals were only part labelled, a problem enough, but for my wife being vegetarian it was a nightmare. If you wanted dinner at the restaurants you had to queue to make a booking. There was only one person you can book with and this happens between 12-3pm. At times you can be waiting 40mins to be able to reserve a table and you can only book as far as 3 days ahead and 2 restaurants at a time. The restaurants themselves had the same menus on every visit, I expect they rotated them monthly, not very good if you fancy a change. Additionally half the meals were also available at 'Chilis' lunch buffet, therefore the variation was somewhat limited. Both my wife and I suffered from 'stomach upsets', for me it was twice after I had dinner at the Mexican restaurant. Speaking about lack of variation, the entertainment also rotated on a weekly basis and lasted from 9.30 to 11.00pm only. The hotel is simply outdated, I was told it is about 5 years old, well the interior designer for it must have been stuck in the early nineties. It is very tired and could do with a refurbishment. The location was flat and featureless, we did travel into Playa Del Carmena few times including for a meal with friends, here we visited 'Mandarina's'Champagne & Pizza' Restaurant'. It looked great, all in white leather etc. However no air con, poor service and we had to send back 2 main meals as they were so appalling, that was after they arrived 20mins after the other main meals! Afterwards however, we did find 'Senor Frogs' which was good fun and the drinks and entertainment were good, both during the day and evening. The beach was very nice and we spent the first few days here, however they do not have any parasols which I found unusual for a 5 star hotel. If you want to stay in a 'pretend' 5 star hotel choose this one. Actually dont, as you can find something much cheaper elsewhere. I do not mean to sound so negative, but both my friends, wife and I were so disappointed with the hotel. We wanted to wind down and relax and instead half the time we were wound up! I would heartily recommend the Iberostar at Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic over this hotel, its much nicer, the service, food and drinks are very good and its a good \u00a3500 cheaper!", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunnyvale", "Title": "\u201cAlright for a one time visit to Mexico\u201d", "Author": "VivieinDFW", "ReviewID": "UR69349706", "Content": "Our plane was delayed leaving Dallas so we lost the first half day of enjoying the resort. First let me say, the staff works very hard and the place is beautiful. We had a lovely room and great beds and working A/C. I did note that the mornings we left no tip for the cleaning lady that those were the days we did NOT receive a cute animal on the bed made from big towels. They stocked our room to an acceptable level as far as booze and soft drinks go. There is a unique smell that followed us back to Dallas; I have had to launder my clothes twice to get rid of this unpleasant odor. We ate at chili's and the main dining hall every day. We chose not to get reservations for the fancy places because my son did not bring a pair of pants with him. I heard the Mexican restaurant whatever its name was was not very good so we missed that meal there. The buffet is good for about two days and then i grew tired of it; the presentations are lovely but there are not enough signs around the dishes indicating exactly what is in them. The few times i ventured out and tried a new dish I was not impressed; i pretty much just ate salad, fruit, chili with beans, pico de gallo and guacamole for every meal and I am not a picky eater; the meat did not appeal to me; i was so excited when they had large grilled shrimp one night but they were tasteless! i was so disappointed bc i love grilled shrimp. The other problem we had was with communication; even asking for the simplest of items was quite challenging. I think the RIU ought to spend money on training their employees to speak better English. I asked for crackers one night and ended up with a small round bowl for catsup! The room service is fast and very good according to my 17 year old son. We got room service almost every day even for just a small snack. The pool is very nice and crowded. But heck I can swim at a pool anywhere. There are loose straws floating on the water but I tried to ignore those. They use straws that are twice as tall as any glass they have. The drinks were ok, nothing to write home about. We had good luck using Juan Jose of Lomas Travel for booking excursions away from the hotel. He was most gracious at dealing with our requests. The water in the Gulf at this location is extremely choppy. At any given time, I saw no more than 4-6 people in the water. It was rough and hard to do any walking or swimming in the water. You would walk for a lil bit and then the sand would drop off a foot so you and to be prepared. My son almost sprained his ankle in the water. The spa place is OK; i have gotten better massages in the U.S. but they were cordial and on time. We went to Fifth Avenue twice and bought some souvenirs. They had lots of pricey cheesy items but we figured we can't go wrong with buying t-shirts for friends and family members. It was fun to people watch there also.

THE BAD 1. 45 min ride from Airport. Was not informed of this and hotel transportation did not include a car seat for my infant. Spent entire ride terrified for the safety of my child. 2. Room was not ready at 6pm. That's right, 6 pm. We were told to wait \"20\" minutes, 2 hours later at 7pm, the room still wasn't ready but we went inside anyways while the maid finished. 3.While the room was \"ok.\" Had a king sized bed, nice jacuzzi tub and sofa area to watch tv, the view from our room was HORRIBLE. They must have put us in the worst room possible. Our view from our balcony was a factory next door...well the roof of the factory with the gigantic LOUD a/c units on the roof that hummed us to sleep every night. 4. Cleanliness of linens and towels. TERRIBLE. Stains on everything. Looks like someone bleed out on one of the sheets that we had. I just ripped it off the bed and threw it on the floor. One set of sheets we had was soured as well. Talk about a stinky night. Next night the sheets smelled so heavy of bleach my eyes were watering. At least I know they were sanitized? 5.Food. The only decent meal was breakfast at the buffet place. When we went down there I had jokingly told my husband that I was afraid that I was going to gain 10 lbs, well I actually LOST 10 lbs because I couldn't eat the food! If it wasn't over salted (which most stuff was...) it had flies on it or it was spoiled tasting. The special (Make a reservation at least 3 days in advance) restaurants were laughable. At best the food was not good and worst it made some of us ill. My husband is upstairs now with a fever and sickness from our meal last night at the \"Japanese\" restaurant. 6. Room Service. Ok I know it's all inclusive and it's free but how about more than 3 items on the room service menu? One cannot live on ham and cheese, cheese cake and cheese nachos alone. (Especially when your restaurant foods are so poor.) 7. Service. While the waitstaff did their best to help and be prompt about stuff the front desk rather sucked. Our room did not have a room service menu and I called down to the front desk and they said that they would send one up right away. 2 hours later, no menu, so I call down again and 20 mins later I get a menu in GERMAN. So I called down again and apologized but I needed an English menu...I never got the menu. The next day I went down stairs, I figured, hey I would pick it up myself but Noooo they can't do that, the maids have to bring it. 1 hour later I finally got a menu in English. (Of course I found out it wasn't worth it when I saw it had a grand total of like 6 items on it, no joke!) Front Desk drama continues...On night 4 at the hotel hubby and I were awakened at 4am to the sounds of a woman screaming bloody murder, glasses breaking and silverware hitting the tiles out side our door. My mother in law tries to call the front desk for help because this was an all out brawl/fight going on and never got an answer. The next morning we went out and there was blood all over the floor the walls, my mother in laws door...it was everywhere. Looked like a scene from a horror flick. So I went downstairs and asked the front desk if they knew about it and they said \"Yes, we are going to clean it.\" I'm like when is that exactly? Its been there all night and I just had to roll my childs stroller through BLOOD to get to the one elevator in this place!' They eventually did clean up the blood on the floor at least...about 2 hours later...but the blood spray on the walls was still there when we left this morning! 8. The ONE Elevator that was 400 miles from our room. Yes, one sad elevator that was 40 rooms down from our room (about 1/2 mile hike) that ended up in the dark, scary KITCHEN Of a restaurant that you had to navigate through the DARK on SLICK WET FLOORS to get your child outside into the main plaza. Really seriously? I know it's Mexico but don't they have any handicap laws? Ok forget that, how about a resort so expensive, lets at least have a safe, friendly way to navigate our grounds with a wheelchair or stroller? Ok...so that was the bad. The GOOD. 1. The ocean was really pretty. (Though as the other poster mentioned it had some serious undertow problems while we were there. Constant \"Red\" flags.) 2. The pool was pretty. I didn't find that it smelled funny. 3. The wait staff was 90% friendly and prompt with requests. 4. My sister in laws wedding ceremony was beautiful. I hope she had a good time. At least that was positive. 5. Their pi\u00f1a coladas were awesome. 6. The breakfast buffet especially the coffee and sopapillas. 7. The hotel grounds were really pretty.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montoursville, PA", "Title": "\u201cTHE best RIU experience to date!\u201d", "Author": "pamzanski", "ReviewID": "UR68152193", "Content": "Just returned from our 8 night/9 day stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya! I never am sure how to start these reviews so I'll just dive in... For an overview: We have stayed at Riu's twice in the DR and they were fabulous the beach is perfection and service top notch. This is what I will use to compare our RPRM experience. Arrival: We arrived in Cancun at 10:30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The airport was deserted. Seemed as if our flight was the only one...not sure if that was the case or not. We had pre-paid for private transfer with cancuntransfers as recommended by many here on TA. We were not disappointed. They were waiting immediately outside of the airport with a sign bearing our name. Easy to find...once you got past the Timeshare sharks. Just ignore them and act like you know where you are going. Anyway, the cancuntransfers gentlemen were wonderful. They spoke very good english, which we were appreciative though we attempted our broken spanish to bridge the gap...was a great experience. The drive was about 45 min to an hour depending on traffic etc. To give you an idea, we were in line at the hotel making a la carte dinner reservations at 12:05 p.m. (after checking in) Not a bad turn around if you ask me. Check In: Check in was a breeze. The front desk staff spoke exceptional english and made this very easy for us. We were early, so our room wasn't ready. As a side note; This hotel stay was a comp stay from Riu due to an overbooking we experienced in the DR last summer. We did not \"pay\" for a superior delulxe Jr. Suite (courtyard/pool view), but had emailed several months ago and asked for this (never hurts to try). The front desk asked what room we would like...guess as a courtesy, we said we didn't want the top floor and didn't want the bottom floor and wanted a courtyard view. She was a little mixed up as when we returned at 1:30 to check on the room availability she had assigned us room 41; a garden view on the ground floor. We said absolutely no to that. She then gave us 2077 which was a semi-courtyard view. To explain, the room was on the third floor, not the top floor, and faced from the balcony, the lobby to the left, the lobby bar straight ahead and the courtyard to the right. When we got into the room, we noticed that the beds (pushed together as expected) seemed smaller than the beds in the DR. There, they were queens, here, they didn't even seem like doubles (we sleep on a double at home). There was no way that both of us could sleep on one...we have a teenage daughter who would need the other. We called down and asked if we could be moved to a room with a pull out couch. They said that the room next door, 2078, had a pull out and that would be ready in about 30 min to an hour. We were allowed to stay in 2077 until the other was ready...so we headed for the pool. We checked back in an hour and things were moved over to 2078 and it was perfect. The front desk had said if we wanted, on Saturday, they would move us to a more central courtyard view if we wanted to. We did not. The reason we stayed in 2078...from the balcony or just inside of the room, we could pick up the wireless connection from the lobby. With a teenager, that was very valuable. The Room: I mentioned the location in the previous paragraph and our reason for liking it so much... We also have mentioned about the beds. The other portions of the room were no different than others have described; sunken \"living room\" that served as our extra bedroom, nice dresser, flat screen TV, nice balcony size (2077 had a smaller balcony), the mini fridge fully stocked with Dos Equis, pepsi, orange soda, 7up equivalent, Diet pepsi and bottled water. We typically tipped the mini-bar guy and he would give my husband 6 beers vs the normal 3 or 4. Also in the mini bar, Jose Cuervo Gold, Smirnoff Vodka, Brandy and something else we didn't notice. Actually, we NEVER used that alcohol as we got drinks from the lobby, pool restaurant... (We tipped the maid on occasion, but our room was spotlessly cleaned daily even without it.) There was a coffee maker in the room which was nice for those early cups before your shower. There was a large closet and the typical room safe, two bed-side tables and of course the bathroom. The bathroom had a toilet and dual sinks and the hydromassage tub/shower. To use the hydromassage, you had to of course fill the tub above the jets. That my friends, takes about an hour and uses a ton of water. We attempted it once and never again as it seemed a waste to us of time and water. We had great showers with only the occasional burst of hot water that lasted for about 1 second. Great water pressure. Please remember the water is not potable. The Restaurants and Food: The Buffet, Don something, (don't recall the name as we always entered in through the side door rather than the front door) was awesome. The only night I wasn't impressed was the Caribbean night...but I found the staples to get me through, salads, pasta and pizza. There was always some sort of Mexican food, my personal favorite, pasta and pizza as well as salads, cold cuts and cheeses. We have alot of pictures of the Mexican Night if you would like to see them...sometimes, it helps to LOOK at the food to help assess the variety. You won't be disappointed. It was always good and much much better than the Riu's in the DR. We also ate at the Agave (Mexican) Restaurant and the Krystal (Fusion) Restaurant. Both were good, the service exceptional, but we preferred the variety at the Buffet. The Krystal had the exact same menu as the ones in the DR...so it wasn't a \"treat\" for us, though the food was good. I was suffering from a severe Margarita hangover when we ate at the Krystal so I wasn't a good judge of much, though the rest of the family enjoyed it. The Agave was great...the Mexican salad and hors d'oeuvres buffet was great...I actually filled up and couldn't eat all of my beef fajitas :(. We ate daily at Chili's with a table overlooking the beach and ocean...it was great. The food there was exceptional as compared to the equivalent in the DR. Large variety of selections, soup, pizza, pasta, fish, steak, ribs, hamburgers, hot dogs, desserts...the list is very very long. Great food. We often took a paper plate of pizza or fruit to the pool and they gave us no hassle...even provided us with plastic forks. There were also nacho chips and cheese always at the pool for your enjoyment. The pool and the Beach: The pool was of comfortable size, not too big and not too small. We spent most of our time here. There are two Jacuzzis several tables with seats around and sun beds in the water. The pool bar does have seats contrary to one reviewers mention that they did not. The infinity pool was also nice...typical Riu styling and size. The temperature of the pool varied. Most days, it was on the warm side. We had one day of clouds and some rain which made for a cooler pool the next day. My husband preferred the ocean. It was cooler than the pool and warmer than the Atlantic experienced in the DR. Quite refreshing. The surf was rougher than the quiet of the DR but we enjoyed that. The sand, though beautiful, didn't compare to the powder of the DR. There were alot of shells (and the occasional piece of trash and straws)...things that made the sand more abrasive which I don't care for...but that is the Mexican coast and we were acceptant of that and certainly are not complaining. Just providing facts. Even after the restoration, which made this beach huge, there is a drop off just after entering the waters edge...be careful...with the larger waves, it can catch you off guard. I would not let small children venture in alone if I were you...I'm an adult and I had problems. Activities: We were so busy during our 9 days we had no time to enjoy any of the provided activities such as Catamaran, Kayaks or such...we'll do that next time. We did participate in water volleyball and water aerobics which were a blast. The Entertainment team at this Riu is outstanding. The only show we went to was Michael Jackson, which we enjoyed in the DR....The MJ here was not very good at lip syncing but was a good dancer. The backup dancers were outstanding and worth the watching. It was a good time and we enjoyed it very much. Overall, this was a much better performance than the DR...better costumes, music setting etc. Venturing out: We went \"downtown\" to Playa del Carmen three or four times during our stay. It was fun shopping up and down the streets and eating in the different restaurants. People watching was great as well as getting to know some of the locals. Awesome time! Very safe (normal precautions taken regardless of where we travel) and we had no bad times. We ate at two restaurants: La Parrilla and Carboncitos. Carboncitos was my favorite. The tacos al pastor were fantastic and you sure can't pass on the chips and the variety of salsas which is why I went in the first place. Absolutely awesome. The Margaritas were fantastic...they squeeze limes for theirs rather than using a mix and they were great! I would highly recommend not having more than two...the last one I remember was three...'Nuff said there...it made for a long afternoon. Anna, thank you for taking care of me as I drank my way through the Mexico Soccer game. La Parrilla was good...was nice to sit overlooking 5th ave and people watch...my daughter had the chicken sesame fajitas and they were to die for, my husband had the chili relleno which was fantastic and I had chicken super nachos...they were just \"ok\". Just chicken, beans, cheese and chips. Just to let everyone know, most \"salsa\" served with chips down there is pico de gallo and not what they often serve in the US as tomato based (like PACE). I expected what I got, but heard some woman complaining that the salsa wasn't salsa...You're in Mexico...not the US...! Other information...The best prices we found for tequila was at Walmart. Though it was fun to shop around, we found that 470 pesos for Don Julio Anejo was the best price we could find...good ol' Wally World. Jose Cuervo was the equivalent of $11 US, alot cheaper than our 17.99 bottles here in PA. We wanted to bring home something other than Cuervo so we opted for the Don Julio. Awesome stuff. We also went to the shops in the Playacar plaza...cool stuff, normal actually. Prices were a little higher and less haggling there...was much more fun in Playa del Carmen on 5th. it was nice to go to in a pinch though. Service: The service at this Riu is beyond compare. We were pampered and indulged at every turn. There are not enough words to express our thanks to the fine people of Mexico that work in these resorts. They work tirelessly and make working 12 hour days effortless. You will not have better service satisfaction any where. I wish I could remember the names of everyone that touched our hearts, plates and glassware while we visited their country...Again, our highest praises and our warmest thanks to you all. Other: We celebrated our 9th wedding anniversary at the Riu on the 16th. They staff at the buffet sang for us, gave us a cake, decorated our table and delivered a bottle of Champagne to the room as well as special towel art. It was fantastic! Made us feel very special. There were about 15 weddings while we were there....on some days...three at a time! Everyone joined in; not sure if the brides appreciated that but we all cheered with them. Most of the guests were great. We met alot of really wonderful people. I only ran into a couple of moaners and complainers everyone else seemed quite happy. The heat was oppressive on the first day to us. We did find however that we acclimated quite fast and by the third day, we were no longer sweating as badly and the 90's were easier to handle. Doesn't take long. Overall, this was our best vacation yet. It is a definite return trip for us. We want to enjoy the water sports next time, maybe the ruins and we never went to the spa or gym...there was so much to do here in this portion of Mexico...it kept you busy and active. We were very sad to leave but know we will be back next summer to continue our new love for Mexico and the RPRM!

We contacted the wedding department and they were very helpful. They answered all of our questions via email (to avoid international phone charges). We booked our trip through Orbitz for May 27-June 3. Orbitz actually offered us $600 back a month after booking because the price of our trip had gone down. Instead of taking the cash, we put the money toward the master suite, which we HIGHLY recommend. The suite is huge and includes a second-story outdoor jacuzzi. The spiral staircase on the balcony makes for gorgeous wedding pictures! We booked the Royal Wedding Package for 20 guests, which includes the ceremony, decor, reception food/drink, champagne toast, the wedding cake, bride's bouquet, a short couple's massage, and a room upgrade (pending availability). All of our guests stayed at the resort (80 percent of your guests MUST stay at the resort in order to have your wedding there) an had the BEST time! Everyone said it was the best vacation/wedding they'd ever been to! And it is so affordable! We met with the wedding planner the day after our arrival to choose our cake and bouquet and any extras we wanted. The planner was very organized and friendly. She made sure the flowers arrived in my hotel room while I was at the salon and kept checking in with my with weather updates the day of the wedding, as rain was in the forecast. We had the option to move the ceremony indoors, but we're so glad we didn't, because the rain cleared right as our ceremony was scheduled to begin! We had our reception at Bota Fogo, which was great. We ended up having the entire restaurant to ourselves, and they set up a head table for us. We even held a mini concert after the dinner in the restaurant, since many of our guests are professional singers on Broadway! We ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla frosting, which was nothing extraordinary, but very tasty! My bouquet was gorgeous- white lillies and roses. And I paid extra for a lily for my hair. I got my hair done at the resort salon the morning of the wedding. Couples receive 10 percent off all salon services. I had a hair trial with my stylist in San Francisco and brought pictures to the Riu salon. The stylist did an excellent job copying the style! And every strand on my head stayed in place! The stylist knew exactly how to fight the humidity! : ) We got married at 5pm in the gazebo. It was perfect. Things start to settle down at the pool by then. There was a wedding at 3pm the day of our wedding and the ceremony had to compete with a game of pool volleyball! People were VERY respectful for our wedding. Just don't be surprised if you have some onlookers for your beach or gazebo wedding. Honestly, though, we didn't even notice them because our ceremony was so beautiful. We brought our own officiant, which I HIGHLY recommend because the officiants that the hotel provide do a very, very speedy job! We saw one wedding that couldn't have lasted 10 minutes! After the reception, we took a taxi into Playa del Carmen and danced the night away! We did a lot of sightseeing in Tulum, Cozumel, and Playa del Carmen, and got a lot of massages, went parasailing, rented wave runners, zip lined through the jungle... please ask if you need any recommendations!

We ate at the steak restaurant, steak and lobster, ha ha, the lobster was half a lobster and steak was approx. 3-4 oz. small portions to say the least, we also ate at the krystal which is 'fusion' food, this was very good.

This hotel exceeded my expectations in everyway. When they call it a palace, they mean it. The rooms are large with a comfortable sunken living room that opens up to a spacious balcony. We had an extended balcony, this was nice as the other were about half the size, however still a good size. Although the rooms quiet I suggest the rooms that face the outer edges of the resort, or near the pool area, the plaza area can get very loud during the nightly entertainment. The rooms were very clean and very well maintained, daily cleaning was prompt and turndown service provided that little extra something special. Room service is complimentary and was usually delivered quickly, although it was a limited menu, everything we ordered was very good. I suggest tipping your room attendant every day 20-30 pesos, this goes for room service as well, this gets you that little more attention to detail, keeping this in mind they will never provide anything less that perfect service if you don\u2019t tip. The beautiful bathrooms provide everything you expect from a 5 star hotel, except shampoo. Conditioner, yes, however the shampoo is a \u201cshampoo, body and hand soap\u201d all in one, its not very nice, so bring your own or hit up the sundries shop in the lobby. They have nearly anything you need or forgot at home, however for the budget conscious bring your own sunscreen, at nearly three times the price as the local drugstore it was a bit of a shock, this applies to the shops down the street as well. Another sunscreen tip you may have never thought of is, buy biodegradable sunscreen, any of the tours that involve snorkeling or swimming of any kind are usually in sensitive ecological areas and regular sunscreen is not allowed as it my be harmful to the marine life. Our rep was very helpful in providing tour information, however your travel agent at home should be able to book any tour for you and at very good prices. FOOD! Excellent, in every restaurant we tried. There are many a la carte options, you can only make reservations for these from noon till 3pm daily in the lobby, you can only make two at a time, up to 3-4 days in advance. To get the restaurant you want you should be there at noon. Even if you don\u2019t get the one you want, you will not be disappointed, each one was unique and offered great food. Although we were not able to get into the Japanese restaurant people were raving about it, we tried the Mexican restaurant, any seafood dish was amazing, and you MUST try the Mayan coffee. The Brazilian restaurant was excellent, however not if you are a vegetarian, we like meat and there was plenty of it. And Finally the steakhouse, this is an out door setting, so dress accordingly. It can get very hot, the dress code is a little more lenient here. Button up shirts with short sleeves are acceptable, depending on the maitre d you may be able to wear shorts, just head down a few minutes early to ask. The other restaurant however the dress code is more strict, as it should be for fine dinning. One couple as actually asked to leave for wearing shorts and sandals, if you have any questions, just ask, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The beach was amazing, huge and fairly clean. There are a lot of deck chairs and drink service if you are sitting in the Riu\u2019s area. You don\u2019t feel crowded as the beach is massive, you can choose from full sun down by the water or sit comfortably under the palm trees. With access to all of the Riu properties in Playa Car you can enjoy the bar service, breakfast, and lunch in any of the Riu hotels, although I\u2019m not sure why you would want to leave this amazing resort. The Beach at the Riu Palace Mexico was nicer in my opinion, mainly because the bar was closer to the beach and a larger shaded area under the palm trees. The Playa Car area was amazing, with some local shops across the street from the resorts and most of the Riu hotels within a 5-7 min walk from each other you have everything you need. If you want to venture into Playa Del Carmen, 5th avenue is a Mecca of shops and restaurants. Just a 15 walking for 5 min in taxi, pay no more than 50 pesos, this easy access city offers a vast collection of duty free shops, from personal experience check your local governments duty free allowances. From Playa Del Carmen you can also catch the ferry to Cozumel, my favorite stop when traveling by cruise ship. Always check the schedule for the return trip, there are two companies that operate this service and both depart from the same pier on both ends. The best tip we received was only to buy a one way ticket so when you get there you can grab the ferry that suites you, so you are not tied to one schedule. The fare is 280 pesos round trip or 140 one way. You can take out money once you are there from any ATM, I recommend using the Peso, however you can exchange money at the bank or even the hotel front desk, rates can vary however its very little when it comes down to it. They will exchange Canadian dollars, US dollars and several other currencies, if you are Canadian, take Canadian dollars and exchange it there, if you buy US dollars and exchange it there you loose out of exchange rates twice. This resort overall was amazing, clean, great staff, very well maintained great food and very relaxing. If anyone has a complaint about this resort they are seriously mistaken.

After a long tiring journey (12 hours due to diversion from ash cloud) the staff gave us a warm welcome and we began to relax and enjoy the surroundings. As this was our honeymoon we received champagne and chocolate covered fruit in our room, which we thought was a lovely touch. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. But unfortunately you could hear a lot of noise from the corridors, but this died down later in the evening. Bathroom was nice and modern with good lighting. We used room service a couple of times after long day trips and found it was very efficient. The beach was quiet as a lot of people chose to surround the pool area, so this was a nice place to come and relax. Unfortunately the sea in this area is very rough so we did not go in as much as we would have liked. We stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess previously and swam in the sea every day with no problem. The hotel is in a good location. Playcar is a lovely, clean safe area and it was only 20 mins walk to Playa del Carman. We often popped into the town for a browse and a spot of shopping. For anyone who would like a break from All Inclusive we would recommend Carlos & Charlies, fantastic fajitas! Also did the trip to Cozumel (only 30 min ride).

Just go back today- enjoyed it so much, i felt it worth putting a review on right now. First things first, traveled with Thomson non stop fro Glasgow to Cancun, excellent flight, lots of legroom, but why oh why Thomson, do you have to pay \u00a35 to upgrade your video package to be able to see more than one movie- this is a 10.5hr flight after all. Anyway airport transfer went smoothly, just ignore the tickets touts at arrivals and head straight for your coach. An hour later, at the hotel, to a nice cool fruit juice presented my the reception, and also our room upgraded at no extra cost. Room 2074, perfect location, looking inward to the hotel grounds, huge balcony gets the sun all day till about 5pm- by then you need some shade. The buffet restaurants were superb, and to be honest you could have ate there every night and still have been delighted. However we ate in Krystal, the fusion restaurant, was great, and different and well worth a visit, Agave, the mexican restaurant we ate twice in, very good also, Bodafogo the brazilian restaurant was a novel experience and well worth a visit if you like to eat meat, and Chiilis which doubles as a steakhouse at night, also very good. Didn't try the Japanese restaurant as not a big fish fan. pool was superb, always lovely and warm, and generally not two noisy. We also enjoyed lying out on the beautiful beach. Also saw 6 weddings whilst there, grea So some pros and cons:- Pros:- Wonderful location,great food, fantastic staff (and I really mean that), always helpful, always smiling, and always encouraging me to try my limited Spanish! Great aircon in room, just a truly great hotel! Cons:- (and these are extremely minor)- not enough alcohol in the cocktails- maybe not a bad thing if you are at the pool bar all day! The occasional American that doesn't know how to talk quietly- boy can they be loud when they are in a group. The Brit families who hog all the sunloungers with their towels at 7am every morning with their towels round the edge of the pool all day, and then disappear- you know who you are Geordies! But really they were minor, not the hotels fault, thats just people for you i guess. We also rented a car for three days, did it online with easyway rent a car, did it online before I came out, cost me $134 including all insurances, and they delivered and picked up from the hotel. We went to Xel-Ha for the day, its fantastic, and well worth a visit. The next day we had the car, we drove to Chichen Itza, well worth a visit, we went the non toll roads via Tullum, great roads, straight as a die, and we stopped at Valladollid for lunch. Well worth a visit, although it took us 30 mins to find our way back out and that was with sat nav!. We ate at a great little restaurant right on the cornet of the square, can't remamber what it was called but it had black bars on the windows, the food was cheap and fantastic. We then stopped at a cenote at Dinzit. well worth a visit. We stayed over one night at the hotel, mayaland hotel and bungalows, stayed in a bungalow, and went to the light show at night- which was poor, but went to chichen Itza first thing in morning before crowds got there. Finally do go into Playa del carmen, we went into 5th avenue during the day, and at night, great vibrant atmosphere.

The RIU Palace Rivieria was AMAZING!! This is also the first time any of us traveled to the Cancun side of Mexico, we had been to Cabo San Lucas but not Playa Del Carmen. I definately liked Playa Del Carmen better, it seemed much more laid back and relaxing than Cabo. First, the drive from the airport to the resort takes about an hour, but the drive isn't bad, there's alot of jungle and little towns on the way to look at. We got the hotel in the late afternoon so our rooms were ready and we were able to get in right away, the \"head\" bellhop brought us out a really tasty fruit punch to drink while checking in, which was a very nice touch. When we got to our room we were surprised to see two full beds pushed together, when I phoned the front desk they mentioned they were full so we couldn't get a king sized bed, but that they could make the two beds into one bed. It took awhile for the maid to get there and then about a half hour for her to remake the bed, the result was a HUGE bed, but we didn't mind too much. For the most part, every thing was laid back and slow, but again we didn't mind at all, it was very relaxing!! After reading reviews here, I advised my family to bring small bills for tipping. We tipped all the waiters and the cleaning staff...our room was ALWAYS clean (complete with really awesome towel animals!) and service was always good. The waiters remembered our drinks throughout our stay, and the staff was extremely courteous. Food- I really enjoyed the food. The morning buffet was huge and it was awesome. We only ate dinner at the buffet two nights, the other three we ate at the ala carte resturants. The first night was the buffet, the second night was the steak house (chili's) I was not entirely impressed with the ambiance but the food was good. The third night was the buffet (we planned an excursion for the day...review later). The fourth night we ate at the Brazilian resturant...AMAZING...hands down the best resturant of the trip for us. We loved the food and the atmosphere!! The last night we ate Krystal, the gourment resturant..the food was delicious, but the other patrons (three other tables) didn't seem to like our table having a discussion, so that was a little bummer, the staff however seemed to love having us there. You definately had to get to the reservations desk early for the resturants, they fill up fast!! Activities- we decided that we did not have enough time to enjoy all the activities we could have done (we where only ther for 4 full days and 2 half days). The beach was the place to be for our group, we loved the hammocks and the beach chairs, there was plenty of shade for us (even for my Dad who has skin cancer from lack of sunscreen in his youth). The water was warm and the people friendly. My Mom, brother's Girlfriend and I went to the Spa while the boys played golf...the Spa was very relaxing and reasonably priced, definately worth the experience. The guys enjoyed their golf expedition, apparently there are many lizards on the course and occasionally monkeys would come out the jungle, needless to say there were many hilarious stories from the golf course!! Tours- We scheduled a tour with \"Best Day Tours\" to go see Tulum and then Xel-Ha. The tour was a joke. Tulum was absolutely beautiful, but the guides (which you don't need) just tell you what you can easily read on the placards all over the park. By the time we were even able to see the ruins we only had about an hour, my family and I broke off from the group to check out the ruins on our own. I would suggest that if you want to see the ruins hire a cab to take you and bring mosquito repellent!! Xel-Ha was an amazing water park, all of us had a fanastic time there, I would definately reccomend it. The resort itself (as well as the rest of Playa Del Carmen) is in a gated community, it felt very safe to be there, in fact we walked down to the \"downtown\" area just about every day.

We decided on this hotel after having a look around a Riu Palace in Dominican Republic a couple of years earlier, whilst staying at another Riu. I'm one of those people that researchs, researchs and researchs their trips. I was not disappointed at all. We booked through Thomson holidays in the UK- who I must say were brilliant and after a very long weary flight, followed by a weary coach trip we arrived at the hotel. I walked in and had the immediat WOW factor. Check in was quite quick and painless. Room - a standard junior suite. This looked exactly as it did in the brochure. Then, the only con I can find : I looked at the view from the balcony and found that we were looking out over the roof top of the neighbouring hotel - this consisted of a massive mobile phone type tower/aeriel with lights on it. A flood lit tennis court with very bright lights- which shone directly into our room, air conditioning units and massive rusty water tanks. I immediately went to reception and told them I wasn't happy. They said that all the rooms of the level that we had booked had an outward view. I explained that I didn't mind that .It was just that , that particular outward view was not acceptable. They were very helpful, explaining that the hotel was full, but guests left on a daily basis and they would move us the next day. I settled for this and true to their word they moved us further along the corridor away from the nasty, noisy view. On speaking to others that arrived at the same time as us , it would appear that they put everyone on our flight in bad rooms. A tactic maybe? The room was kept spotlessly clean. There were his and her sinks in the bathroom and a jacuzzi style bath, which caused a few laughs. The recessed bath area was a little dark though. Food/drink : We ate in the main buffet restaurant, the mexican, the steakhouse and the japanese. I found the food to be very good all round. The buffet and the japanese were our favourites. I probably wouldn't bother with the mexican again as the food was better and not dis similar in the buffet. We didn't like the look of the menu in the fusion restaurant. We didn't try the snacks in the sports bar- these were just burgers and a microwave. Also there were a lot of people smoking in the sports bar. We didn't try the room service. I drink white wine and found this to be a little hit and miss. I think every time I asked for it I got a different one. The magaritas were wonderful though Pool/Beach : very nice pool area, plenty of shade, umberellas and sunbeds. Gets very very noisy too as there were a lot of loud american/canadian groups. We tended to move to the beach in the afternoon as the sun went from the pool at around 4pm and set at around 5.30pm. I did think the beach was a little dirty- littered with cigarette ends , straws and plastic cups. The drinks service was a little hit and miss, but that didn't really bother us. It's no big deal to get off your sun lounger and go to the bar. There have been a few comments previously about the 'grey whale' beach defenses, but I didn't see these as a problems. I actually think they make the beach a little safer from non swimmers and children. Evening entertainment : To be honest I didn't rate this much. Although I know the team work very very hard, it was all a bit samey and typical RIU like. They held a couple of casino nights which were good fun., but if you ate late you could miss all this. And most nights there was a band /singer which was nice to listen to in the back ground. Staff : We found all the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. All in all we had a wonderful trip. In fact we got engaged here (not a reason for the good review). We would defiantely go back and recommed it to others.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cThey really dont care if you're happy or not\u201d", "Author": "figchef", "ReviewID": "UR66358562", "Content": "We stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya for 4 nights at the end of May. We immediately had problems within the first 20 minutes of our arrival. We arrived early in the afternoon and our rooms were not ready for another hour or so. This was not a problem for us. We used the time to immediately make reservations for the restaurants, and grab a quick bite from the buffet. We were completely baffled to learn that we would not be able to eat in any of their ala carte restaurants. They were completely booked. The hotel clearly advertises that they have multiple restaurants, whether ala carte or buffet. I could understand if one of the restaurant was full, but all of them. We immediately complained to the front desk, and they just stared at us with zero compassion. It was immediately quite obvious that the Riu has a very loose policy on customer satisfaction. Our rooms were clean and fairly new. It had a tub/shower combo with no light in it. It felt like I was showering in a closet. The bathroom was clean, and remained clean during the remainder of our stay, as did our room. The walls are paper thin, and you could hear a mouse sneeze in the next room or hallway. This didn't bother us much, since we were out in town all night. I could see this being a problem for a couples/relaxation getaway. The food was just god awful. Even the Mexican food was terrible. We were all scared to eat half of the items displayed at the buffet restaurant. I basically stuck to rice and chicken breasts for 4 days. They also need to do a better job with serving utensils. It was disgusting seeing the guests hands all over the food, and cross contaminating everything in sight. The Brazilian restaurant was the worst. We saw cockroaches on the buffet/salad table, and the food seemed like leftover items from breakfast. As for the entrees, this had to be the absolute worst meat I have ever eaten in my life. It was so dry, overcooked and under-flavored. There is zero pride taken with the entire Riu kitchen staff. By the end of our trip, we weren't shocked by the inedible food. We just worked around it. We actually went to go eat on 5th Ave because the food was so bad. The beach was very relaxing, and the water was great. However, good luck getting even a cube of ice on the beach. The one and only time I saw a cocktail waiter on the beach, I tipped him $5 USD just to bring me 4 cups of water. He took my money and never came back. Note, I said cups of water. This cheap hotel doesn't even have the decency to give its customers a bottle of water. I had to walk all the way to the bar by the pool just to find they only will pour you water into a dirty glass with ice from God knows where. If you want a bottle, you need to walk all the way back to the lobby, where they dish it out like FEMA MRE's. The bar absolutely smelled of decomposing beer, and was unpleasant to even order a drink. The drinks.........The only place to get a good drink was the lobby bar. Sheila during the day and Islas in the evening were VERY nice bartenders. They seemed to be the only employees in the entire hotel who took pride in their job. The choices on alcohol were sub par. The only good tequila they served was Jimador. Now if we were drinking Jimador, I would be complaining. The sad fact is, we weren't. Every time we ordered a shot, it was a different color and taste. This is the obvious clue that they were refilling the bottles with, well, I dont even want to know. I'll give the Riu the benefit of the doubt that they are serving what is advertised. After all, I didn't actually see them refill a bottle. Lets talk about room service. Since the restaurants food was so terrible, we barely ate. There is nothing worse than going to sleep on an empty stomach. I attempted to order room service on the first night, and was dumbfounded by the whole process. I called the room service number around 2am and nobody picked up. I actually let it ring for a solid 5 minutes. Then, I called the front desk to let them know there was no activity with room service. He said he would call security and call me back. 20 minutes later, and into a deep sleep, my room phone rings. \"Room service, what would you like?\" Well, since there was no menu to be found in any of our four rooms, I told him. He said that they dont have a menu in the rooms. \"Would you like me to read you what we have?\". Here is what the Riu thinks room service should be. Club sandwich, hot dog, nachos, Caesar salad, fruit cup, cheesecake. THAT'S IT! I have stayed in many all inclusives before, and I have never been so shocked to be offered such a pathetic choice of items for room service. Good luck getting a chair at the pool area. You literally have to wake up at 8am and put a towel on your chair to guarantee a seat. This is always a problem at most hotels, so I cant complain. Im on vacation and dont need to wake up early. However, after monitoring the enthusiasm of the staff, the pool really didn't seem very clean. We never went into the pool, not even to wet our feet. Also, they are incredibly stingy with pool towels. You cant even get one extra towel without giving them some sort of song and dance. Most of the hotels I have stayed in in Mexico allow you to call the US for free. Not at the Riu. Even with a calling card, there was a connection fee per call of $1.50 US, and then the minutes on your card. There was WiFi in the main lobby, and it was very, very slow. Also, make sure you bring your sunscreen from home. It will cost you $22 at the hotel gift shop. In a nutshell, the Riu Palace Riviera Maya has a good location, being close to 5th Avenue. The place looks very nice outside and in. The rooms are clean, which is the single most important thing for me when on vacation. The beach is very nice, but bring your own drinks.

Unlike other RIUs we have been to, this is not a high-rise, limiting it to 3 floors which mainstreams the look and gives everyone a view of something. Some of the larger ones we have stayed at are so big they look and feel like prisons. This hotel is perfectly situated about a 20 minute leisurely ocean-side stroll into PDC, and a 5 minute walk to Playacar Plaza. The beach is breathtaking and incredibly clean. There are smaller waves, so those with children beware. The pool is a good size to feel comfortable and the bar service is spot-on (although it closes early at 6 PM). Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly counter person who gave us refreshing non-alcoholic drinks to sip on as we checked in. We went to our room on the third floor that was the size of a closet with a puny cramped balcony (reminiscent of old row houses where you can ask for a spoonful of sugar from your neighbor by reaching your hand over the wall), and the tv in a room not visible from the bed. I went down to ask for a room change, and for a small palm greasing we were given a fantastic room that was above and beyond what we wanted on the 2nd floor (Rm. 2129). The room was very clean and well appointed with mini bar, iron, board, hair dryer, built in booze dispenser and 2 queen sized beds that were pushed together (we moved the tv to suit our needs). The maid service was fantastic everyday and we were always greeted in the afternoon with a new towel animal. HUGE KUDOS to EVERY employee working at this hotel. ALL are super friendly and willing to do whatever it is you need to be comfortable. Even though it is an all-inclusive, I always tip which may be why people remembered me, but certainly wasn't the reason for the friendliness. Even though everyone always says that Aruba is one of the friendliest Caribbean destinations, we have ALWAYS had the best of 'service with a smile' in Cancun and the Mayan Riviera. I rate MX way above Aruba in this department. OK, so those were the positives (and they are enough to make us go back in a heartbeat), but there are some pitfalls to consider. This is an all-inclusive, and with that you have to expect certain short comings. Number one for us was the food. The Brazilian restaurant was downright awful. It is not the helps fault because they are all very friendly and cordial. The food is just poorly chosen and poorly prepared. My wife is Brazilian and we go to a Brazilian restaurant at least once a week, so we know authentic fare and this is so far from that. The Japanese, well, don't even want to go there, just not worth it. The steak house was a joke. I am a big steak eater and had to laugh at what I was given - you would get better at a York Steak House! My wife had a different selection with same result. The Don Manolo buffet for breakfast was TOP NOTCH, with french toast prepared fresh as well as an omelette station. We didn't do lunches as we were always actively doing something somewhere else. The buffet dinners were hit or miss, sometimes good, sometimes not so good. If you are a cabernet lover as we are, DO NOT order it here, it is atrocious. We love Chilean wines, but RIU has one brand for the entire place and it is not a good Chilean. They only have one brand of champagne as well, and while not outstanding is certainly acceptable. Dos XX on tap everywhere is great, although some taps are cold and some warm (welcome to the caribbean). The Dos XX in the mini bars in the room are great, although they only supply 4 at a time so we ended up calling room service quite often (sometimes it arrives fast, but usually QUITE slow). The last negative would be the entertainment we saw. Big time hit or miss on this one. The first night was an extravaganza show and that was very good. The second night was a broadway dance show that was incredible, with professional dancers. The third night was Michael Jackson, and while ok, we have seen this guy at every RIU we have been at (not sure what RIU's fixation is with Michael but he will always have a home in one of these places). The crazy show the next night was a Saturday Night Live attempt that was way off the mark. The tropical show was unremarkable, but fine. The Mayan Show was downright AWFUL. VERY loud and obnoxious. Last year we saw one of these local Mayan shows at Dreams Cancun and thought it was fantastic, this was bruatlly bad. The last night, the Mariachi show was fair, and actually had someone from the audience stop the announcer mid-sentence to complain about how bad it was. Although I didn't think it was that good, I didn't echo his sentiment - but at least that gives an idea. Four of our nights were completely rain soaked so we had to ditch our idea of hitting 5th Ave. PDC after the RIU shows, so it made the flaws in the programmed shows even more evident. Bottom-line, we really liked this place (and Playa Del Carmen in general) and would go back. I will say that the PDC 5th Ave. venders are extremely obnoxious trying to get you to come into their bars, massage parlors, buy weed, etc......but moreso during the day than at night. I think being a bigger guy made me an easy target to gain their eye attention (which is what sparks the banter they throw at you). PDC has many choices to hang out in and things to see, but there is way too much thump-thump nightclub music for our tastes. We did find some good live music venues though. Overall, we will probably hit Belize or Costa Rica next year but if a group of friends wanted to go to PDC we would do it, and stay at the RIU. On a side note, we walked to all the other RIU's in Playacar to see them, and there is ABSOLUTELY NO COMPARISON to the Palace Riviera Maya (although we loved the beach bar at the RIU Mexico!).

The staff, hotel, rooms, entertainers, food, cleaners & local Mexicans were so friendly, helpful & went out of their way to make our stay very enjoyable. The resort of Playa del Carmen was lovely, it was really nice to walk along the beach to 5th Avenue & enjoy a quick drink or to barter with the local shop keepers (who were not over pushy, but extremely friendly). We did not choose to do any of the organised tours but used the local 'ADO' buses from the terminal in 5th Avenue, all the buses were first class(with air con & movies)! & a fraction of the cost that the tour reps were asking. We visited Tulum (fab beach & ruins), Cancun (used the other Riu hotels facilities but they did not come near to Riviera Palace) & Excaret (quite disappointing....once you've done Disney Florida there is no comparison). After reading the previous reveiws on this hotel I would probably agree that if you go within any of the American holiday periods or if the hotel is at full capacity it would be a much different holiday. During our stay we never had any problems with getting a table in the main restaurant, we did try 'Chillis' a la carte but the food was so good in the main dining area we never felt as though we needed to try any of the others but booking any of them would not have been a problem with the booking system they had. After a full day at Excaret & returning to the hotel at 11pm we rang room service who delivered freshly made sandwiches & a flask of tea (great service)!!

It's about an hour from the Cancun airport and we had no problems getting there with the shuttle service they arranged for us (included in the room rate). We drove past several hotels/resorts on our way to the Riu Palace and it's definitely one of the most upscale in the area. Once we got to there, the staff was extremely friendly from the bellhop, to the front desk clerk, to the housekeepers. We spent every day out at the pool or on the beach. They have lots of activities going on during the day and the pool staff does a great job of keeping everyone entertained (water sports, trivia games, music, dancing... all family/kid-appropriate). The beach was gorgeous -- plenty of lounge chairs both in the sun and in the shade from palm trees. The food at all 5 restaurants was pretty good. Our favorites were the Japanese and Fusion places; make sure you make your reservations 2 days in advance though. Both food and drinks (alcohol too) are included in the room rate and they are generous with both. There's a minibar in the room, but not a lot of mixers. The drinks at the pool and on the beach are always available, but they have little to no alcohol in them unless you ask one of the waiters and tip them (20 - 50 pesos). There's really no reason to leave the resort unless you want to, but there is a fun shopping area they call 5th ave about 20 minutes walk (5 mins taxi) from the hotel. The vendors asked 2-3 times what things were worth, but it's easy to haggle them down. If you want to snorkle, scuba, parasail, etc... there is a company that organizes daily trips right on the beach in front of the hotel. There's also a desk in the front lobby where approved tour guides have information if you want to take a trip to see ruins, cenotes, tulum. They really do a great job of making sure your trip is easy and stress-free. Overall, our trip was amazing. Everything you would expect from a Resort like this was there and the staff exceeded our expectations. We gave the \"value\" category a 4/5 because we aren't big drinkers and this place may be a little over-priced if you don't take advantage of all the free drinks.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, UK", "Title": "\u201cWow - classy, definitely 5* All Inclusive\u201d", "Author": "KeyWest77", "ReviewID": "UR64773111", "Content": "<Overview> We had an excellent stay at this 5* hotel. Its the best All-Inclusive we have been to ever, with excellent food and service. Of all the Riu hotels here the Riu Riveria Maya Palace is the quiet, classy one - great for couples who want 5 star service and a relaxing break. Check out my photos and feel free to ask me anything. -9.5/10- Room - We didn't upgrade and had one of the Junior Suites. It was spacious with 2 x single beds. The beds were OK but not very inviting, the matress covers felt plasticy and the sheets were bobbly. One complaint we did have was the location of the TV - it is fixed so that it faces the small 'lounge area' and therefore cannot be viewed very easily from your beds. Now, I am not here to spent time sitting on a sofa watching TV but I would like to watch the news for 10 mins before bed, ON MY BED. Note to hotel - PUT THE TV's ON THE WALLS FACING THE BEDS!! The bathroom was nice and spacious, with 2 sinks and a hydromassage bath. The minibar was good and re-stocked daily (except on the last 2 days, when it wasn't and even after ringing reception 3 times and being promised someone would come they never came!). Minibar contents - 2 x 7ups, 2 x pepsi, 2 x diet pepsi, 2 x Canada Dry, 2 x 1litre water, 2 x 500ml water, 4 beers. Also Bacardi, Vodka, Whisky, Rum optics. The room service wasn't good - not reccommended. -8/10- Beach - About 10-20% full when we were there. Most people stay around the pool. What this means is that the beach area (shaded by palm trees) was very quiet and relaxing. The beach area nearer the sea (the area not shaded by palm trees) was even quieter and you could be a good 20-30m from the next sunbathers. The sand is a bit grity but stays nice and cool, even in the scorching heat. The sea has strong undercurrents and on the windier days, I believe it is forbidden to jet-ski or para-glide. Waiters from the pool bar do regulary come round with a selection of drinks (not the first week we were there but the second week) -9/10- Pool Area - This is the prefered location for people through the day and so was a little too crowded for us. The pool itself is a nice size with 2 jacuzzis and swim up bar.The pool was not pristine clean and could get quite dirty with used straws floating around (from the swim up bar obviously) but was generally fine. -8/10- Weather - Wow! We enjoyed virtually wall-2-wall sunshine everyday for the first 12 days of our 2 week stay - no cloud. Temperatures reached 34C and alot of people got sunburnt. Then on Friday 14th and Saturday 15th we got more cloud but was still OK and warm. The day we left though, Sunday 16th, the sky was quite overcast and we were glad to be leaving - I wouldn't like to be arriving then. I think we got lucky. -9.5/10- Main Buffet Restaurant (Don Manola) - Firstly, excellent service! The waiters are VERY attentative and will allow you to sit where you want. We liked the main buffet so much that we didn't really bother with the speciality restaurants. We went to Chili's (Steakhouse) and had the steak, which was good, and the Agave (Mexican), which was also very good, but decided the main buffet was just so much better as you could just go up and get what you want and however much you want! Breakfast - American style breakfast, bacon, sausage, hash browns, donuts, crepes, toast, omelettes, salad, loads of fruit, champagne (Whooo!), fresh juices, vegetable juices, so much more. Lunch - Most people go to Chili's for lunch which has pizza, burgers, chips, fruit, salad, fried chicken, hot dogs, fruit, much more. A few people (including us) went to the main buffet where the choice is more limited but still good. Dinner - A lot of choice at the main buffet. There was always chips, pizza, chicken, sald, fruit, roast beef, roast pork, roast chicken, paella, crab legs, strawberries, chocolate fountain, crepes, chili con carne, chicken nuggets. One thing I will say is that all the food was top, top quality and anyone that complains about it needs to get real. -10/10- Entertainment - Take my advice and head down to the Riu Tequilla (5 min walk) for the entertainment. The Riu Tequilla is a less classy hotel (with much rougher looking bunch of guests to go with it - haha, its true!!) but what this means is that the nights there are MUCH MORE FUN. It hosts the same entertainment nights as the Riveria Maya but the stage is much bigger and the productions are therefore much better performed. We saw the Michael Jackson show at both the Riveria Maya and Tequilla and there was no comparison - its a completely different show at the Tequilla, The Tequila also has host fun, audience participation warm-up shows at around 9pm (the Riveria Maya didn't) before the main show at 9:30pm. The best shows were nearly always the audience participation shows (as usual) - Miss Tequilla, Perfect Couple, Karaoke etc.... (At the Tequila) 9.5/10 Playa del Carmen/ 5th Avenue - A 15 min walk away, we were quite dissapointed with what we found here. Its just one street with tacky, cheap shops, with people trying to get you to look inside. It is full mostly of cafes, restaurants, souvenoir shops, cheap jewellery shops, not much else really. Worth checking out but I wasn't impressed. 5/10 Thomson Trips - We were going to do the Chitzen Itza Deluxe trip for $99 but in the end decided against it. Here's why: Firstly the trip included a visit to a cenote cave to go for a swim - why do this? I want to go to see an archaelogical site so either go to another Mayan site to fill the time or skip the swim altogether and head straight to Chitzen Itza, you know, hopefully before everyone else gets there! Thats the other thing - everyone gets there in the middle of the day. Why not start off earlier or skip the cenote cave and beat the crowds? At $99 I don't think the trip is worth it and I would rather spend the day on the beach instead of on a coach. Response to some criticisms I have viewed on this website: Old-fashioned looking - No, it's looks classy with a very attractive plaza area Cockroaches - I will believe people but I didn't see any myself Making reservations - Yes, you have to go to the lobby to make reservations for the speciality restuarants but you can make reservations for the next 2 days so you dont have to do it everyday if you want to eat somewhere other than the main buffet. Also, it takes about 5 mins. Basically, forget any minor negative reviews on this website -- this is about as good a 5* All-Inclusive as you will find.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gardner, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Place - Exceptional Service!!!!\u201d", "Author": "pakrem", "ReviewID": "UR64734268", "Content": "My wife and I read a lot of reviews about this resort before traveling to this Riu resort.

I have never vacationed where I felt so lazy that I did not have to swim up to the pool bar! The pool attendants are running around looking to serve you. We would raise our hands in the pool, catch there attention and they would literely run to you to service you and bring the drinks back to you. We did tip the staff and a little goes a long way. Not too much but we both felt that even though we did not feel pressured to do so, they were that good. From the room service, room maids, the waitstaff, pool attendants and waiters and waitresses, they were all so friendly and gracious. The breakfast and dinners were very very good. Lunch is lunch at a resort like this. Nothing fancy but enough of a selection to fill your belly. My wife had mussels every day at lunch and the rest was very good in a casual beach setting. They had a cook out one day and it was a nice mix. We felt safe at every juncture on our trip. Not that we were reckless, but we were cautious to a point but never felt uncomfortable. We actually took a ferry ride to Cozumel and rented a vehicle for the day and had a great time. Just driving up the coast line and stopping for lunch and a few adult beverages at a few places. Never felt in harms way. Many tourists traveling and enjoying the sites. The only encountering problem at the airport and 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen was the selling of vacation clubs. We got selected at the airport and thought it was part of our transportaion. Just watch out for this. They are all over you at 5th Avenue. Just relax and take it in. All in all our best vacation yet.

We chose the Riu Palace Riviera Maya since we had such an awesome time in the DR. This hotel, although it is a carbon footprint of that in the DR, is not as nice. I will start with the pros: I never had to wake up early to reserve a seat at the pool. The food and drink were plentiful. I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend is a meat eater. We both enjoyed the food and drinks. Lots of selections! The weather was awesome, as was the ocean! We were well treated well at the bars. They all were fun, happy to serve you and helpful. Leo with the Entertainment team is awesome! Make sure you spend some time with him. Cons: We had to terminate multiple cockroaches in our room! Turndown service (I love this service- don't know why) was inconsistent. We only received this service 40% of our 10 night stay. They \"forgot\" to clean our room one day. The beach still is quite eroded. If you stick your toes in too far, you will hit concrete. The nightly entertainment shows were terrible! The only show worth seeing is the Michael Jackson show (don't miss it). We spoke with 2 different couple who had their rooms broken into! Cameras and phones were stolen in both instances. The Sports Bar has 3 channels: ESPN and ESPN 2 (they both air the same program) and Fox Sports. I enjoy baseball and wanted to watch the hockey and basketball playoffs at night. This was not possible! I may never watch another soccer game again. Most importantly, I am a Hotel Manager by trade. Hence, I enjoy talking with the Directors and Managers at places I visit. The Director, Javier, was not willing to speak with anyone! I witnessed his curtness with the staff which was quite disturbing. He avoided eye contact with anyone and the Guests who had their rooms broken into, told us that Javier refused to speak with them! Don't get me wrong- I had a tremendous 10 day vacation!

The trip met our expectations, and in most instances, exceeded them! First, we booked our trip in March 2010, and went through the Riu website. This was probably the most troublesome part of our trip - the website crashed twice while trying to book the trip. I called the Riu number the following day to make sure we had not been charged. We had not, so we attempted a third time on the website, and had no issues. I would recommend calling the 800 number - they were very helpful in my interactions. We arrived the first day, and were able to check in at noon. The staff at the front desk greeted us with drinks, and were very polite. Our transportation to and from the hotel was included, so we made our way to meet Miguel, who apparently coordinates the transportation. He gave us a brief overview on some day trips without being pushy - we really came to RPRM to relax, not trek. After going to our room, I went back to the desk to ask for additional toiletries, and overheard that the hotel was only at 60% occupancy. That being said, it was a clear sign that our service was going to be extraordinary since the staff was not dealing with their usual large crowds. The room was very clean, but by the end of the week, it did have a musty smell, and our clothes never seemed to dry. The mini-bar was stocked every other day. We stayed in a junior suite, and did not spend much time in our rooms other than to sleep. We did order room service one evening at midnight, and had our food within 20 minutes! As other reviews have stated, the pool is large and beautiful - we found ourselves rotating between the large pool area and the endless pool. It is kept clean for the most part, but by 3 or 4pm, you would see the occasional straw or trash from the swim up bar area. Nothing you can do about that. The staff by the pool were great - if you needed a drink, they walked around every few minutes to assist. There were plenty of chairs in the sun or shade, but as some other reviews referenced, many chairs had towels on them at 7am, although they would not have a person in them until 11 or 12. Again, no fault of the Riu, just inconsiderate people. The beach was large with plenty of chairs. We would typically head there in the afternoon. We seemed to have an exceptionally hot week, but the weather was terrific - sunny everyday, no rain whatsoever. The breeze by the ocean made the heat much more bearable. We rented Wave Runners one day - it was $60 for a half hour, but was well worth it. They offer free kayak rentals, as well as catamarans, which we also took out one afternoon. Looking back, I wish we would have used these earlier in our week, since it was a very nice option. My wife and I are new travelers, so we may not have the highest standards for food at a resort, but we were pleased with all of our food options. We ate at Don Manolo's for breakfasts and lunches, plus a few dinners. It's a buffet, so it is not gourmet food, but they mixed things up nicely. We were happy with the food. We also tried Agave (the Mexican restaurant) and the Japanese restaurant, and were very happy with both. We were able to get reservations with no problems - maybe that was more of a result of the 60% occupancy. I can not speak for the Brazilian, fusion, or steakhouse since we did not eat at them. Chili's (the steakhouse) also serves as a lunch/snack location by the pool, and had more limited food options, but was still a nice option. We ventured out to 5th Avenue one evening, but were turned off by the huge crowds/merchants/drug dealers. There seems to by lots of night life and restaurants, but we visited for an hour or 2 and did not eat out. There were plenty of neat stores, plus plenty of places to get a drink or 2. I was more comfortable on the resort, however. If you need toiletries, this may be a better place to purchase them (rather than the hotel gift shop). The gift shop in the hotel charged 125 pesos for a travel sized shaving cream! We also took advantage of the other Riu resorts, and spent a night at the disco at the Riu Tequila. It was a bit grimy, with confetti carpeted walls and very dark lights. It was good for a laugh. That particular resort seemed more wild and rowdy. The lobby bar was a great time, and the bartenders joked around with everyone. We much preferred our hotel and the openness of our resort, but for one night, we had a great time. The entertainment on the resort was very good as well. The Michael Jackson show was fun - even though we thought the person playing Michael was a little lazy with his dancing. He did look just like him though! The entertainment staff was very friendly, and the head guy Leon got us laughing daily. Not to mention, by the end of the trip, we could not stop singing the \"Si Si Si, No No No\" song that is played a few times a day. Overall, we had an incredible trip. The accommodations were great, the staff was incredibly friendly and courteous, and the weather was beautiful. I would definitely stay at a Riu again, but probably in a different location (for no other reason that I would like to travel to new locations).", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort at a great time!\u201d", "Author": "carissaM", "ReviewID": "UR63235296", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya April 24-May 1, 2010. This was a GREAT time to go: no spring breakers, no crowds, no waits, plenty of chairs, mostly great weather. The resort was gorgeous, the food was suprisingly pretty good, the liquor was all top-shelf, and the staff was energetic, courteous, spoke impeccable English, and worked very hard to keep us very happy. The Playacar area is gated, and we felt perfectly safe at all times. If pressed for negative comments I would say this: 1) It's almost impossible to eliminate the humidity, so our room did smell slightly musty, and the clothes I brought home definitely have a musty odor. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a resort in Playa del Carmen where that is not the case. 2) There's not much for nightlife after the 9:45 pm show, but you get free admission to Riu Tequila if you want to go party after 11. 3) There are no umbrellas for the chairs at the beach - for shade at the beach you rely on a stand of palm trees, but because the sun moves, you may have a shaded spot but then be in full sun after 30 minutes. Not a huge issue when we went because there were always plenty of empty chairs, but that would have been a pain in the neck if there were more guests at the hotel and we couldn't just switch seats. 4) The gym facilities were not great. The one elliptical machine did not work at all and there were no free weights. But there are plenty of opportunities for outdoor exercise. 5) If you are at all \"into wine,\" you will be sorely disappointed with the wines. However, they offer a sparkling wine that's not bad. The beach is beautiful, but the ocean in this area is variable: two days it was perfect for swimming with gentle, rolling waves; another day it was fine for kayaking (free rental through Riu). The other days, the surf was too rough to swim, and our planned snorkel trip had to be cancelled for safety. The pools were top-notch. I've never seen better, or even close. We visited the other 4 Riu resorts to get a feel for our value, and we felt like price difference was well worth it to stay where we did. The only other one in the same class was Riu Palace Mexico. The food seemed pretty similar, and the layout was almost identical. I don't know how the guest rooms compare. The pool at Riu Palace Riviera Maya was much better. Tips if you are staying here: the reservation restaurants are not an extra fee. Go to the Mexican place. It's amazing. The Brazilian one is fine. We didn't get a chance to go to the steak restaurant because they close it down for wedding receptions: if you want to try it, ask at the beginning of your stay which nights it will be open. Drink tip: The cocktails and particularly the daquiris are very weak, but the bartender will add extra alcohol if you ask.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201c5 star?...

All claim to be 5 stars. There is one thing for sure that I cannot deny... The service and friendliness of staff is top notch and I can't complain. Everyone smiled, said \"hola\" and was at your beck and call. FABULOUS SERVICE. The pool was HUGE, very nice. I did find it a little dirty though during the day, we must have picked up 50 straws from the pool during our 1 week stay. THe ocean and beach are both fabulously gorgeous! The water activities were fun too $$$. We went seadooing. Our Wedding was fabulous... BEAUTIFUL. The wedding coordinators did everything they could to make our day special, and it was. The rooms are very clean and roomy (except for the occasional roach). Now to the down sides.... The hotel itself is clean but old fashioned looking, where I prefer very light colors and modern designs. It was very darkly decorated with big bold brass framed pictures, dark paints and fabrics etc... Not my thing. Several people in our group were severely ill with Travellers diahrea. This ruined the vacation of some of the guests. 3 of the 6 rooms in our group the guests saw roaches, some alive some dead. Gross. The rooms smelled musty for the most part. My mother had to change rooms several times till she found one that didn't smell. In the end she had to take a downgrade in her room because there was no rooms in her category that didn't smell. Plain annoying. The Air conditionner in 2 of the guest rooms my group occupied worked when it felt like it. Mine was one of the rooms involved. I ended up changing rooms with a free upgrade that ended up being worse. At this time of year it is really hot, and we knew that before going but did expect sufficient air conditioning to keep us cool at night. We spent alot of time awake at night due to the immense heat. The Maintenance guy was fabulous... He did his best to fix the problem but unfortuntely... it wouldn't cool the room off. I think the air conditionner they are using for the tiny rooms is the same size as the Presidential suites... which is why it is so hot in the large rooms and colder in the tiny rooms. Had it not been my wedding I would have downgraded to a smaller room.... but this trip was a little different. The food.... MEH.... Nothing really to rave about. The steak at the Chilly's restaurant at Diner was the best one. For breakfast: There's something not so indearing about hotdog weiners in my morning eggs. I didn't find that appealing at all. This was one of the buffet breakfast options. I must say that some relatives on my husbands side had never travelled and they thought it was fabulous but I've seen WAY better. Personally I wouldn't go back. We were told the RPRM was the newest, most modern of the RIU chain. If that's the best.... I don't want to see the older, lesser quality resorts. I wouldn't recommend this resort to a well travelled person or someone with high standards. But if you haven't travelled much... try it out you may like it. Overall I found this resort quite disapointing for the HIGH cost we paid to travel there from Canada... $2600 per person Canadian Funds.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Otsego, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cEverything we hoped for & more...\u201d", "Author": "shore525", "ReviewID": "UR63123990", "Content": "Me and my wife planned this trip in early January 2010 and we were looking for a hotel that offered a great beach, nice pool, great location (close to 5th), all inclusive, and reasonably priced. This hotel met all those categories. We traveled with 3 other couples and the overall point of the trip was to get some much needed relaxation & have a great time with friends. This hotel definitely accomodated that. If you want to relax you just go down to the beach (which is one of the largest/nicest beaches compared to the other hotels). If you want to have some cocktails by the poolside bar there are plenty of tables/jacuzzi's for you to lounge in, or if you wanted to relax by the pool it's large enough where you can stake out a quiet spot. What I liked best about the hotel is being we booked it somewhat in advance we got a great deal (ex. under $1000 per person, where other AI's at the time we booked were more like $1300-$1400 pp) which makes it affordable to leave the hotel and experience downtown Playa, excursions, etc. & not feel guilty because you spent so much on the all inclusive package. Our group loved to go out and hit the local discos and restaurants so this suited us well, and being it's so close to downtown Playa it is like everyone stated in previous reviews a $5 cab or 20 minute walk on the beach. For dinners we hit up Krystal, the Brazilian, the steakhouse, and the buffet which were all very good. However, if you are looking for great authentic Mexican food we tried El Fogon in downtown Playa and that was phenominal!!! For drinks, the lobby bar was a frequent stop to begin the night festivities and we met so many wonderful people from all over the world that really made this trip even more enjoyable. As well as the lobby bar staff, in particular Islas & Jorge, they made it a very entertaining & enjoyable experience. We didn't go to any of the shows, so I can't speak on that. We did however hit up the disco at the Riu Tequila one night which was fun, but in no way as entertaining as the discos in downtown Playa Overall, I would characterize this hotel as a great place for your daytime activities such as the beach, pool, and relaxation.

The hotel was amazing, loved every second of staying there. The people were wonderful, wait-staff were there every second attending to our every need and the restaraunts were top-notch. The bed was a little hard, but not too bad where you couldn't sleep. The walls are okay - no really loud noises from the neighbors, but the hallways are tiled, so sound reverberates tremendously. Even being quiet, conversations can carry into the rooms. These really aren't negatives in my opinion, just observations. The buffet was wonderful at each meal. Fresh food, variety each day, and a smile and tip of the hat from the supervisors of the waitstaff. The entertainment crew were top notch and kept us entertained each day and night. Catch the shows, they're great and no two days are the same. Anything that uses gasoline costs money. Jetski's, Parasailing, etc. So be ready to spend money to do these things. The snorkling trip was great! I recommend it! A great trip and wonderful sights to see. Tulum (the local Mayan temple) was a great sight to see as well. My only real negative had nothing to do with the hotel, but leaving the hotel for any outside shopping. American/Canadian/Mexican, mid 30's and a credit card seem to be the target for the gentlemen selling time shares. Every where we went, we got hit up for a time-share tour - and I had more Mexican 'friends' than I knew. Everywhere we went was, \"Hello my friend, let me show you what I have in my store\" or \"Hello my friend, where are you from?\" Usually the second question was followed up by \"why don't you come and take a 90-minute tour.\" One guy actually told me he could get me anything I wanted and then emphasized \"Anything\" while holding his hands out making an hourglass figure - the international sign for woman, I'm guessing. Advice: If you're looking to bargain and don't mind the hassle, go in town and get stuff - it's cheaper than at the hotel. Some of it is really nice, too.

Food excellent except for Kristal which we thought was \"precious\" and not worth the effort. Hubby got sick after and lost a day of vacation. Playa is gorgeous and who cares if women are topless? Love the European aspect of life here. Massages ok but the tent on the beach for massages is distracting, especially with the people arriving to claim chairs. Massages at Aventura Spa are BETTER!!!!

Drinks were watered down ask for more rum. Rooms were nice and clean but the beds were hard. My fridge was restocked everyday. Towel art made everyday .Beach was nice and large but the water was not as clear as the water on down the coast only about 2 ft. visibility. Waves were real rough one day. Plenty of lounge chairs, but if you get up late dont expect a prime spot. Breakfest was great. Every breakfest item imagined was there. Lunch buffet at poolside had a little of everything, no one should go hungry. Dinner was a different theme every night but most everything stayed the same except for the speciality dishes that were prepared for the nights theme. Waiters came around every few minutes to check on you. Dinner at the speciality restaurants was a nice change of pace. Made 2 reservations for the early seating, no problems or standing and waiting in line to make them. The Brazilian was great, bring a big appetite and a love for 10 different types of meat. Crystal was a fusion type restaurant some of the food was a little strange if your a real picky eater skip it. The nightly shows were on the cheesy side tried to watch the Grease and Circus/Acrobat shows but could only stomach fifteen minutes or so. 5th ave is about a 20 minute walk away or a five dollar cab ride, you pass by two small sets of ruins along the way. The only things I disliked about the place (personal opinion only) was that it was just too big and to close to town with hotels up and down the coast. I perfer a more secluded spot ,stayed at the Catolina Royal Tulum (which is not as nice as the RPRM) 3 years ago and loved the smaller secluded jungle feel to it. Also the distance to the highway made it difficult to easily catch a collectivo. You had to walk to PDC near 5th ave to catch one. I would like to note that I am a easy going person and could have a great time anywhere The hotel is great but I did not have a great time there (no fault of the hotel).... it rained constantly 80% of the time we was there(not just a sprinkle but heavy rain most of the time) 18% of the time gray and gloomy skies, 2% sunshine (only 10 hrs of sunshine the entire week) . Went snorkeling at Akumal Bay during the short time the sun shined one day, saw sea turtles and stingrays, this was the highlight of our trip. Tried to visit 5th ave (been there before) to do some shopping while it was sprinkling but after 5 minutes there it came a downpour that flooded the streets after 2 hours of trying to wait it out in a shop we decided to give up and braved the hurricane like rains to catch a cab back to the hotel.

Our room keeper always left \"designer\" towels on the bed, which was turned down at night with chocolates on the pillows. There was always ample supply of bottled water. As others have mentioned, tipping or leaving a few dollars a day goes a long ways. The sun FINALLY came out (it never rains in April when you're in Mexico -- ha!) and we enjoyed four fantastic days at both the beach and pool. Not sure at what capacity the hotel was at, but we never had to \"reserve\" a poolside sunbed, and there are ample supplies of loungers both in shade and sun at the beach. Walked along the beach into PDC one afternoon, and peaked in at the other Riu hotels. Of course, Riu Palace Riviera Maya was top notch (I've stayed at Riu Palace Mexico, which was excellent but RPRM is one or two steps above in service, etc.) We want to thank Rosalba, who does an excellent job at the Reception area. Amazed at how they can remember names and faces. There was ALWAYS a positive answer for any questions or concerns. Dania does a very efficient job at making dinner reservations. Rated Krystal and Yashima as our favorite specialty restaurants, with the Agave and Botafogo coming in a close second. The service provided by \"CHICKEN LITTLE\" (Daniel) is OUTSTANDING. Rosario also deserves commendations. Many others worked exceptionally and always were there to make certain you were treated \"special.\" Rudee and Leo were all over the hotel grounds at all hours of the day/night, entertaining guests with gusto. Personally, I thought the shows were better than average and much better than those on a cruise. Cannot be missed is the Renova Spa treatments. Jorge or Juan David, both were exceptionally well trained, professional, and I recommend the deep muscle massage, exfoliating body wrap, and do not miss the anti-aging facial massage. A bit \"pricey\" but WELL WORTH IT!!! We did go into PDC, walked there and $5 taxi back. Again, I found 5th Avenue to have changed QUITE A BIT!!! No longer small shop vendors. Now it's upscale boutiques eating away at the locals. High-end restaurants squeezed in beside the \"old mom and pop\" shops I remembered when PDC was a quiet fishing village years ago. But it was entertaining looking in the windows and received some shopping therapy. (If you want nightlife, it's close enough to walk or taxi your way into town.) Besides, I always make my own good times -- ha!) There are daily programs you can participate in or just lounge by the pool or walk on the cool white sand. Overall, I personally could not find one \"negative\" thing about the hotel. The price was right for the quality of service, food, entertainment, personnel, spa, beach/pool, etc. Our vacation was made as comfortable as possible by the efficient and pleasant staffing at Riu Palace Riviera Maya. Both the hotel's interior and exterior are immaculate as evidenced by the hard workers. The evening activities around the busy lobby bar (La Habana) was always a fun place to \"people\" watch.

And they have the most stupid and restricted policy about reservations... You need to make the reservations between 12 and 2 PM, only for the next day. Forget it... You never do, because you only had sun at the beach until 4pm. And if you do one day, you never have reservations for the best or another restaurants.

We traveled during Spring Break and were concerned about college kids. Turns out there were groups of kids but this is not really a spring-break destination resort so there weren't that many. And there were no repercussions of them being there - it's not a rowdy place so they fit the scene. Cleanliness: First let me say that I'm completely skeeved by other people's dirt & grime in my hotel room. Well, this place is 100% and absolutely spotless. There are people cleaning ALL day long - washing the hallway floors and walls and everything. You won't even find beach sand on the floors until late in the day. It is super clean. We had adjoining rooms - the kids in one and the adults in another, and the rooms were PERFECT (and I am picky). They change your sheets EVERY DAY. Staff: EVERY single person we passed or met was helpful and polite. We only tipped for one thing and that was the wait staff in the specialty restaurants (oh and $2 per day for our housekeeping staff). I have read that at some places you may feel neglected bt staff if you become known as a \"non-tipper\" but we found that absolutely not to be the case. These people are extremely hard working and make a ridiculously meager salary so parting with a few dollars a day felt like nothing to us. However, we were constantly being approached - being asked if we wanted anything to drink, is everything ok, etc. Beach/Pool: Again, we were there during Spring Break so the place was at capacity. We didi have to get to the pool by around 7-7:30 am to put towels on beach chairs if we wanted to reserve them. Usually if one of us was up, we'd go down, put towels down get a cup of coffee, go back to the room and then go to the pool after breakfast. There were PLENTY of beach chairs - an equal amount in the sun and in the shade. The beach was gorgeous and the water was calm. Jet Skiiers and boaters have to stay far out of the swimming area, so that's not a problem. Food: I am a cook and love to eat so the food was important to me. There is so much variety in the main buffet for every meal, that you could have something different every day. Let me see what I can remember for breakfast: a cold cereal bar with corn flakes, oatmeal & granola, fruit loops, dried fruits, shredded coconut, chocolate chips and more,; eggs any way you like them with bacon, sausage, etc.; a big buffet bar with cold salads, fruits, cheeses; a guy with a big blender making pure fruit smoothies to order, an omelet station, a panini station, hot Mexican breakfast specialties, a variety of breads and pastries (oh and I am a Starbucks drinker and was worried I wasn't going to like the coffee but it was full flavored and really really good). So much. For lunch, there was another buffet which had a great selection for everyone. A big salad bar - always fresh guacamole, homemade chips, salsa, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, fries, grilled chicken, shrimp, one day there was a guy making fresh quesadillas with whatever you wanted to stuff in there - YUM! So much to choose from. Dinner -In the main buffet, lLots of variety again - Specialty nights too - italian, Seafood, etc. Really fresh and good. By about 3 nights at the dinner buffet though, you're ready for a change of pace. Do make your dinner reservations in advance. The restaurants, though not 5-star were really excellent. \"All - Inclusive\" - Snorkeling is NOT included - the \"equipment\" is included. You must purchase an excursion (about $35 a person) to go snorkeling. We didn't do that but did take ATV's into the jungle for zip lines and a cave swim - well worth it. A great trip. There's a guy at the pool who goes around offering it - not pushy or anything - and it was a blast! We let the kids go anywhere in the pool complex by themselves, and we allowed them to eat at the little \"steak house\" for lunch (adjacent to the pool) by themselves too. They had to get one of us to go to the beach. We felt good and safe there. Night Life: There are shows every night - they are \"ok\" - some are better than others. We usually hung out in the courtyard in the evenings - before the show they usually have musicians out there who are really, really good. The shows are done by 11 so there's not disturbance late into the night. I whole heartedly recommend this place, and I don't usually do that! We thoroughly enjoyed.

It is a 5 minute walk to a selection of shops and a 20 minute walk to 5th avenue where there are more shops located. I did not venture that far but my husband did. To be warned he was offered drugs and introductions to women!! General: Hotel is in a good state of repair. It has a small shop which sells sun cream, sweets etc. The hotel is clean, the gardens and surrounding area is clean and tidy. All inclusive: There is a wide range of drinks available. The visitors to this hotel are 95% american and there is a culture of tiping staff continuously. The bar staff, waiting on staff, porters etc. This can become quite expensive if you do tip all the time. If you do not tip be warned that staff can sometimes \"neglect\" you for those that are tipping. We did not tip all the time and did not find this a problem as we just drew their attention and asked for service but it could get you down if you let it. This did not spoil our holiday. Rooms: We were initially given room 2081. If you are allocated this room ask to move immediately. It is situated above the 24 hour sports bar and subsequently the noise continues all night. We travelled with our 10 year old son and had 2 nights with no sleep. I went to reception and asked to move and was told they were having particular problems at the moment as they had groups of teenage boys staying in the hotel. They did relocate us to a much quieter room (1141). The rooms are spotlessly clean and consist of two small double beds (I actually think they are queen size) or one large king size which is double the size of a UK king sized bed. When they moved us they could not provide a bed for our son and said that there was a waiting list for beds! They wanted the three of us to sleep in one bed. Well, after paying \u00a35,000 for a holiday we were not sharing a bed. After 3 phone calls and two visits to reception a camp bed was provided. Restaurants: The main buffet offers a wide selection of food but it can become extremely busy. We tried to be there for 6.30 when it opened as it tended to be quieter there. There is a wide selection of soft and alcoholic drinks available and the waiting on staff are friendly and eager to please. For the 5 themed restauarants these have to be booked between 12 noon and 3 pm daily. You can only book for up to 4 days in advance and can only book 2 sessions at one time. We found that the restaurants are usually booked up for the day you are booking and the following day. All the themed restaurants (apart from the Steak House) provide an excellent choice of food. The Steak House is rather disappointing. Pool area: The area is clean and sun loungers appeared to be plentiful. The area is surprisingly quiet considering the size of the hotel. My son enjoyed the pools. Towels: These are provided daily from a kiosk by the pool. You are given a pool card which you can exchange for a towel. Do not loose this card as you will have to pay for it on departure. Beach: The hotel is situated on the beach and sun loungers are provided. Water sports are available and the sea is sectioned into swimming and water sports area. BEWARE! Many tourists appear to take out boats that they are unable to control and they often cross the swimming area. We witnessed many near collisions and were very surprised that someone was not seriously injured. The sea is not suitable for young children as it is very rough with large waves. The hotel operates a flag system which is helpful. When we were there it was either RED - no swimming, or YELLOW - swim with extreme caution. The sand is golden, there is a lovely breeze. Trips: We travelled with Thomson and went on 3 trips with them. The trip to the Chicha Itzen is a long day (3 hours each way by coach) but worth visiting. We also visited the Mayan Village and Coba. If you go on this trip wear strong shoes as it is a 4 km walk through the jungle to the ruins. This trip was excellent. We also took our son on the sealife experience where he was able to swim with a sea lion, manatee and dolphin. On relection this was quite upsetting for me as I was upset to see them in such confiined spaces but my son thoroughly enjoyed it. All in all a nice hotel, good location with adequate amenities.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cLoved every minute\u201d", "Author": "uklassUk", "ReviewID": "UR61019780", "Content": "Just got back from a weeks stay. The Hotel as expected was spectacular. Service is fab and the rooms are wonderfully clean. We walked to some of the other Hotels but to be honest you're in the best one so why look further. It is also easy getting to 5th Ave which is a large shops, bars and rest area and also a bus and ferry terminal. You can either walk along the road or on the beach. A taxi is about $5. Pool is lovley, it was \"spring break\" week so I assume the pool area is not so busy. Peaople have commented on noisy corridors at night an unruly teens but had no problems, yeah we could hear music from the courtyard if we went back to the room early (before 11) but nothing to stop us all getting to sleep !! We were allocated a room on the second floor over the buffet rest and near the sports bar and had no problems with noise. I would guess that courtyard facing rooms are better than the exterior rooms overlooking the neighbouring hotels. Free wifi in the huge lobby area was an added bonus and adequate for the odd email, facebook update etc etc who wants to sit on their laptop on holiday anyway !!! The food was great and I agree the buffett is better. Entertainment team were fantastic and I was not put off by them in and around the pool trying to get people to participate in activites, If you said no, they always left you alone. Someone mentioned that they were not told about the time change, I saw numerous posters on doors in and around the hotel all that day so not sure what happened. The only bad comment I can make is the reserving of sunbeds. The hotel gives you cards to get free towels from the poolside hut which is open fom 7am till 6pm. By 8am there were never any beds available. People were holding beds with towels, books, magazines etc etc and we noticed most days that some people would not use the beds till the afternoon having spent the morning on the beach or wherever....... I apporached the staff in the pool hut and while they offered to find beds on the beach and bring them poolside they would not removed towels. I took old magazines off 2 beds at 10 am one day and the culprits did not surface till 3pm !!!! This resulted in large groups sitting poolside with feet in water all day long as they had nowhere else to go. All in all we had a great holiday and learnt to get over the minor problem, I just wish pool staff had to guts to sort out the sunbed hoggers so everyone can enjoy their holiday. I would not let this issue of selfishness put me off returning and would stand your ground and take off the books and mags from the bedhoggers !!!!!!", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane Valley, WA", "Title": "\u201cPlaya Del Carmen 2010\u201d", "Author": "Mike3387", "ReviewID": "UR60791656", "Content": "Nice hotel.

Moy, Arcos, Chano, Santos, Joe, Leo, Raymondo, etc. were all there to make sure you never waited for a cocktail. Regardless of where you were on the hotel grounds, the service was outstanding and friendly. Yes, the pool loungers do get reserved by the crazy people who get up at the crack of dawn to take up all the chairs for their brood. But we simply asked the guys to get us loungers when we arrived, and they were very accommodating. Just be polite and not too cheap to give them something for the trouble. We had no problem getting reservations at the themed restaurants, but much preferred the buffet. It made it more relaxing to go to dinner at anytime, rather than a specified 6:30 or 8:45 seating. The buffet was fabulous! We especially enjoyed the lobster tails, grilled and plentiful one night. Traveling as 2 couples, we met many people in the pool, and elsewhere who were fun and very friendly. Although we had intended to check out the other Rius in the area, we never made it, on advise from the other guests the Palace was not worth leaving. Going to town is easy and quick, by taxi or walking if you need to see the 5th Ave shops. The suite we had was very clean, with a well stocked mini bar, and room service for morning coffee was always prompt. There was really only one night that we had a noise issue- (teenagers can drink here) but it was only for a short time. The night we enjoyed the saxophone soloist while drifting off to sleep more than made up for it. The only thing I regret is not bringing our golf clubs, since Playacar Golf and Spa is directly across the street, we would have loved to try a round. Maybe next time. Although an adult only resort is preferable to us, I have a difficult time finding many issues with the resort as a whole.

Workers are constantly cleaning and maintaining the property. It is very impressive when you pull-up to the resort for the first time-- a mediterranean and Spanish influence. Lobby is lovely as well. Hallways are tiled so it can get loud when people come in late at night or yell down the hall. Location: Beach is gorgeous! Hotel is located in Playacar--about a 20 minute walk to Playa del Carmen. Sand is sugar- white and soft to walk on. Water was beautiful blue-green and very warm. Waves were good for swimming and body surfing. Scuba Caribe is on-site for wave-runner rentals, excursions etc. Rooms: Jr. Suites are generous in size for 4 people. Beds are very uncomfortable! Rooms were clean with no pest problems. Bathrooms are good sized. If you are facing the courtyard near the music gazebo you will have to listen to the nightly entertainment until 11 PM every night. Ask to be moved to a different room if this will be a problem for you (or bring ear plugs!) Service: Wait-staff, front desk, maids, groundskeepers etc. were very nice and attentive. Maid service was Ok but there was a problem getting towels when the hotel got the pre-Easter crowd. Food: Food was plentiful and good to very good. We actually preferred the buffet over the specialty restaurants. Breakfast and dinner in the buffet restaurants were our favorite. Lots to choose from and a theme every night. Noise: This was a noisy hotel during our trip--probably due in part to the Spring Breakers who came down with their parents (which surprised me) . The college/high school kids were loud in the hallways as well as by the pool at times. I would imagine it is quieter during non-spring break weeks. Also, there is music by the pool and an entertainment co. that is on the mic trying to get people to do water aerobics, volleyball etc. It got a little old listening to them try to get people to participate after awhile. Attire: Daytime attire is typical resort wear.

Traveled with 3 kids (age 9, 6 and 4). The good - the hotel was beautiful - almost like a high end Vegas hotel. The staff was great and very friendly. The hotel has 2 pools, one which overlooks the other larger pool. Kids loved jumping out of the higher pool to the lower pool. The big pool has a swim up bar, volleyball net and several in water lounge chairs. There were plenty of chairs. Right next to the pool was a great beach with 2 levels. The top level was shaded by palm trees and had a volleyball net and ping pong table. Then down 3 steps was more beach with chairs right up to the ocean. It was a great beach (a few topless bathers) with lots of activities (waverunners, snorkeling, parasailing, sailing etc). The hotel is a 3 minute $5 cab ride to downtown Playa del Carmen which is a great town especially at night. The buffet restaurants at the hotel had plenty of options for all people. (Omlette stations for breakfast, sometimes pasta station for dinner, different themes for lunch & dinner). They also had a Vegas night with Roulette and Blackjack tables after dinner one night. They have a kids show at 8:30 each night. About 15 kids were there each night. Then a main show around 9:30 or so. We did a few activities. We took a waverunner out for 30 minutes for $60 (I did this twice). We went snorkeling (which was about a 20 minute boat ride away near a small reef). My 6 and 9 year old had never snorkeled before and it was a great intro (we were right in front of 2 sea turtles). I also went with my 9 year old to Discovery Jungle Park which was great (although I didn't feel like the safety standards were there). It was a 10 mile 50 minute ATV which started on a main street, then side street then dirt road then bumpy road. Then 3 zip lines (small compared to Costa Rica) and then a swim in an underground water hole (basically a cave). Then the 50 minute ride back. The bad - no connecting rooms. They do have rooms with a small joint hallway with doors 4 feet away from each other. The non-buffet restaurants and their reservation system. I was told that it was hard to get reservations so my travel agent made 2 in advance. They allow you to reserve 2 reservations at the non buffet a few days in advance at noon in the lobby. They fill up fast. The day we got there most things were booked. Plus the reservations they confirmed via e-mail didn't exist in their book. We ate at the Japanese restaurant one night (no hibachi) - the food was so/so. We also at at the Mexican restaurant which was good (not great). We heard from several people the steak restaurant was terrible. My kids preferred the buffet (and I think I did too). Even though it was all inclusive we ate in downtown Playa a few times. It was nice to break up the monotony of the resort. The hotel was nearly overrun with teens. There were lots of younger kids but a lot of 16-22. The drinking age is 18. I didn't notice a lot of drunk teens, but others did. The worst part of the hotel was the noise levels in the rooms. Lots of other people posted how bad it was and they are dead on. They have a door to the halls where the rooms are. People seems to come in at all hours and their conversations come right into the rooms. We asked them to put Quiet signs on the doors that everyone must enter and they said just call. Almost every night several times a night you heard people. Most of it was over by 10:30pm, but I was awoken by drunk kids at 4am last night. They really need more security to police the noise or better doors, walls, etc. Putting a towel under the door didn't help. Finally while the staff was attentive - there were about 3-4 times I ordered a drink that didn't arrive. Usually wasn't a big deal, but nontheless it was a basic mistake that was repeated. There is no internet in the rooms but free wi-fi in the lobby (not a great signal). They have a sports bar that is overrun with teens and usually an overbearing cigarette smell. Finally they promote room service, but the room service menu is small and not kid friendly. They do allow you to bring food from the buffet back to the room. The king size beds are two full or queen size beds together. You can get a free cot which was put by the step down part of the room instead of the couch (which is not a fold out) We stayed at the Iberostar Pariaso Maya in Riveria Maya (about 20 minutes North) 2 years ago and it was very similar (not necessarily as fancy). They had more pools (Wave Pool, etc) and little kid activities (10 and under). If I had to recommend a hotel to a family with kids 12-22 I'd recommend Riu Palace (if you can deal with the middle of the night noise) and for a family with kids 0-12 I'd recommend the Iberostar Maya.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel & Resort\u201d", "Author": "PaulRomford", "ReviewID": "UR60302498", "Content": "Really love the hotel and the staff were fantastic.

Our taste is for more plain food..We are pensioners and used to old fashioned English food. However I would not hold this against the Hotel as everyone has differing tastes and I would not lower my rating of this Hotel on this matter. Whatever we asked for was done immediately and we were constantly asked by the staff if everything was alright and if there was anything else they could do for us. Beddng and towels were changed daily and the rooms were always spotless. I cannot praise this Hotel highly enough. The location was also excellent as we could take a 15 minute walk ,either along the beach or by road and be in 5th avenue shops at Playa Del Carmen. Younger and more agile people could get there even quicker, or you could pay $5 (\u00a33) and go by Taxi.. The locals are also very friendly and obliging and there was no fear of the neighbourhood and shopping in the WAL MART Playa Del Carmen is much cheaper than the tourist shops. The Beach is excellent with wide sands stretching for miles in either direction, however the sea was a little rough whilst we were there, no good for children but ok for good swmmers.

I will say a few things, the ride from the airport is every bit of an hour, put that on your expectations if you are planning on going to this resort. It is a little out of the way if you like that sort of thing. The food is good, but as other reviews have stated you have to stand in line in person on the lobby level to reserve your spot at one of their 5 specialty restraunts, and more than likely they are booked two days out. HINT: If you dont get a reservation, you have two options: ONE: Go eat the buffet (Don Marlo) it is good, but gets old quick, TWO: You can go to one of the specialty restraunts you would like to go to and just see if they have any open seating for you. We learned this at the end of our trip, but when we eventually got reservations to one of these speacitalty restraunts we could see many open tables. Give it a try. And then theres the noise, you can hear everything in this resort, you will see multiple reviews stating as such. HOWEVER... what is in the month of March? SPRINGBREAK. Hello people! If you go ANYWHERE on SPRINGBREAK you are going to get the noise. If you dont want as much noise GO in the off-season! The drinks here are very weak, this is easily remedied as there is liquior in the room, fill up a empty water bottle with some of that and add some to your drinks as they bring them. FYI, I know that it is an \"all inclusive\" but tipping really helps the service here, Im not bothered by this, but some may be. Renova (their spa) is fantastic! Get the OceanView Massage for two. Its a fabulous massage for a fabulous price. Prob the best I have had. Thats saying something.

I know the town very well and have been there at least 10 times. I was traveling with my son, mom, aunt and cousin, and they were more comfortable staying at an all-inclusive. I am not a fan of the AI, but after reading the trusted reviews on this site and recommendation from a few friends, I decided to go for it. I have never been told \"no, lady\" at a hotel so many times at a \"four\" star restaurant. When we arrived, it was a few minutes before the restaurant reservations closed for the day, unbeknownst to us, and we should have been told to hurry and go make them, but we weren't. We tried 5 min. after they closed and they would not allow us to make a reservation. Not a good first impression. So not only were we stuck with eating a buffet that night but the following night as well, since it was already booked up, out of our total of 4 nights. When we finally did make a reservation, we had to wait one night until almost 9pm, which is difficult to do with a 4 year old. Anyway, my biggest problem with the dinners is that there were just a handful of people eating in the restaurant. It certainly didn't look full to me, and it was obvious that they book it for about 10-20 tables a night per restaurant. That is crazy in a resort of 400 rooms. Additional Cons: -The rooms were old and the couch doesn't pull out. -The halls echo and they are noisy until all hours of the night. -The beds are HARD and the rollaway bed is harder. -The kid's program is short: 10:30am-12:30pm and 3-5pm. My son did have a great time and wanted to go to play with kids his own age, but most of the time the workers were late showing up or needed to close early, etc. It would be nice to have an evening kid's club hour too, but they heavily push their $10/per child babysitting. No thanks. -The beds were configured in two standards pushed together which is odd for my mom, my son and I to share. At first, they wouldn't separate the beds either, but I finally spoke to the front desk, and they were able to accommodate. -If we wanted a table outside at the buffet, we were told no because they didn't want to push two tables together for a group of 5. -If we wanted to take a snack outside the buffet, we were told no. -The workout facility is small. It would be nice if there were a few more machine as people were always waiting or hovering for one to free up. Pros (there are a few): -It's close to town either walking on the beach or by cab ($5/car, don't let the taxis con you for more either to or from the hotel) -The public spaces of the hotel are very nice and clean. The waiters are friendly for the most part. -The food is pretty good. -The drinks are pretty good. -The beach has been recently reclamated and you can walk to the pier from here without trouble. -There are kayaks, catamarans (unguided) and paddleboats that can be used for free. Overall, I would rather stay at a regular hotel/resort in town, snack during the day, and have a nice, big meal at a real (non-buffet) restaurant. I think for the price, this place isn't any better than any other all-inclusive.

I've never stayed at an all-inclusive before and really wasn't sure what to expect. Travel there - Although I managed not to have printed out the shuttle pass, we did find our shuttle once we went through the Cancun airport. That was probably the worst part of the trip - I think a lot of planes landed at the same time in Cancun and the airport was a mad-house. It took us an hour and a half to get through customs/immigration and then we had to wait for almost a half hour for the shuttle to pick up passengers at our terminal and another one. So although we landed around 11:30am...we did not get to the hotel until after 3pm...so that cut our first day a bit shorter. As far as the food and accommodations - we stayed in a garden view room which was nice because it was quiet as it faced away from the main courtyard and the balcony was a little more private. The food was really plentiful and had many options for breakfast and lunch. We ate breakfast each day at Don Manolo and we at lunch at Chili's (not the same as the American chain) when we were there for the day. Breakfast was always great...lunch varied but the salad bar was always fresh and I ate a lot of guacamole and pico de gayo. For dinner - you had to make reservations at least 2 or 3 days in advance (which was kind of annoying because you could only do it between 12pm -3pm) for the more popular options (Krystal and Yashima). Krystal was good if you're into that modern fusion type restaurant and Japanese was good. I wasn't a fan of the Brazilian steak house - the Yucatan does not have great beef - so keep that in mind. The Mexican Restaurant was really good...and usually there was always room for a reservation there even on the same day. Definitely ask for the Mayan coffee...you won't be disappointed. Excursions - I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone but we booked our stay through RIU directly and were matched with Hotelbeds for our shuttle and for our local guide to explain things we could do outside of the resort. It's hard to say if we really got the best value for what we did but we enjoyed both. We went on a 'Mayan Adventure' that took us snorkeling in 3 different locations...it was amazing...we went to a cove and saw sea turtles and sting rays...we then went to cenotes and went zip-lining and then we went to an enclosed cenotes which was a cave and got to see stalactites and stalagmites...in all places the water was crystal clear and calm. The whole trip included lunch (which was yummy), transportation and the snorkeling gear...we left at 8am and were back by 2pm...for $86 USD per person. The 2nd excursion we went on was to Coba and the Mayan village...this was a much longer day trip than we were expecting but overall the trip was amazing. We climbed Nohoch Mul and had a great view from the top. We also stopped at an actual Mayan village to see how their descendants live today. It was a great experience. We also walked to the town of Playa del Carmen one afternoon/evening...it's just about a mile away and easily walkable. You can definitely get hustled for just about anything along 5th Ave but there is a lot of entertainment, food and shopping. I never felt unsafe as there were lots of people around and we stopped for cervesas and queso and listened to some live music. It was great and authentic for the most part. If you want to experience some Mexican culture then you will definitely have to leave the resort. The resort itself is very 'Americanized' in my opinion. The evening shows were a bit corny. The service was great overall...all of the staff were very friendly...and you even had a chance to use some Spanish if you wanted to...although not at all required. I would recommend this for anyone who has never been to an all inclusive as a way to start...I think as I travel more I might have more opinions on expectations. Really..all I was looking to get out of my vacation was time in the sun (which I definitely did), drink some fruity/beachy cocktails, not check email and forget what day it was...and I succeeded. This is not a nightlife-type of place...the crowd tends to be a bit older...which was fine by me...I was looking to stay as far away from the college-drinkers.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cLoved the RPRM\u201d", "Author": "Gottatravel", "ReviewID": "UR59242770", "Content": "We visited the property the last week in January and really liked it.

Other than the property itself and the large beach, which has been immaculately restored, there is simply nothing special about this Riu. It gives a typical cookie cutter all-inclusive experience. Don't get me wrong, the experience was good but when you figure that you pay a premium for this Riu over the other Rius and in comparison to other similarly priced properties in the area, it was underwhelming. To give some background, this is my 4th time to this area. Our party consisted of 2 young children, 3 and 1 y.o, my wife, and the kids' grandparents. To highlight some of the positives first: Great location in Playacar- secluded but close to tourist area of 5th ave. Only a $5 dollar cab ride or 20 min walk. Fantastic beach- easy to get a spot and quite large. Nice touch of having hammocks. Property is remarkably clean. Food is good. Nothing gourmet or great but for an AI- good. Decent variety at the buffet. Pool is ok. Tough to get a good spot so wake up early but many AI are like this. Some negatives: Service is uneven. At times service was quick and attentive, other times expect to ask 4 times for a glass of water. Maid service uneven as well. At times, you got all the towels you needed, other times you were left without any hand towels and only 2 bath towels for 4 people. In general, staff here is hardworking but understaffed. Room was a junior suite, but felt cramped. Again nothing nice about it. Asked for 2 double beds, so got a room with 2 doubles pushed together. They actually give the same room if you ask for a king bed as well. Again not the type of stuff you expect from a premium resort. Also no shampoo in the rooms- weird. Food choices- here's one the major problem of the resort. Not much of variety of restaurant choices. For breakfast you get 1 place to eat. For lunch 1 place to eat. Dinner you get whatever rest. you can get or the buffet, and it has some ridiculous system for reservations. Bars are ho-hum. Nothing nice here either. Yes they perform the basic service of dispensing drinks, but all bars are relatively small, nothing too special. Not a family friendly resort. Kids club- yes they have one, is only open 10:30 to noon, and then 3-5 pm. Basically all they do is color and watch cartoons in spanish. Rest. have no kids' menus. Entertainment is ok. If you have seen one of these shows, you have seen them all. Neither a positive nor negative. Now I am being picky here. When you pay a premium over other resorts, you expect a higher level of service and amenities that are missing here. If you have family with young children- STAY AT THE IBEROSTAR PARAISO MAYA.

Very safe as you have to pass through a security gate to get into the Playa area. The resort is 5 minutes from a shopping area and Starbucks, 10 minutes the other way from 5th avenue (which is a tourist trap BTW). ROOMS - the rooms are nice, pretty much what we expected. Make sure to ask for a mattress pad - it makes a huge difference. I like a firm mattress, but the mattresses were way too firm for my liking. Also, be careful with showering before dinner. Lots of people are showering at the same time, so you may experience bursts of really hot water during your shower. Make sure to leave some room in the shower to jump out of the stream of water if that happens. Other than those 2 issues, the room was great. The staff kept our fridge stocked and we didn't really have any issues with the musty smell while we were there. We did notice that our clothes were a tad musty when we got back, but 1 washing got rid of the smell completely. POOL - the other reviews are correct when they say that people reserve chairs. Be prepared to put your towels (and a book or other personal item since everyone has the same towels) out at around 7 a.m. to get the best spots at the pool. We put our towels out at around 7:30-8:00 every morning and got the spot that we wanted nearly every day. Also, bring a beach towel per person. The hotel towels are fairly large, but they don't fully cover the chair. BEACH - the beach is beautiful. They did a great job with restoring it. No more sand whales! Yay!! DRINKS - the staff by the pool was very attentive when it came to drink service throughout the day. Several times, we had 2-3 drinks per person because the staff knew what we liked and brought it without asking. The drinks were good and were well made 99% of the time. In the evenings, the lobby bar is the best place to get a drink. The bartender, Islas, is the best bartender in the entire resort. Make sure to try a vodka lemon or watermelon martini - they are fantastic when Islas makes them! You can also get drinks in the courtyard area, but while the ambience is nicer, the drinks are not as well made. We found that it was better to order a beer or champagne when in the courtyard. BREAKFAST & LUNCH - the buffet for both of these meals was very good. Great selection and variety of items to choose from. ROOM SERVICE - the service was very prompt & 100% accurate. The selection is minimal, but sufficient considering all of the other options in the resort. DINNER - we visited every restaurant during our stay. Here is a quick breakdown: Japanese - don't bother going here if you eat sushi/sashimi on a regular basis. The quality and selection of items is sub-par and lacks imagination completely. The only thing we liked at this restaurant was the sesame noodle appetizer. Mexican - very good options on the salad/appetizer bar, entrees were a little boring. Great guacamole. Brazilian - this was our 2nd favorite place. The bean soup at the appetizer bar was amazing. And, the herb sauce for the meat was outstanding as well. Krystal - this was our favorite restaurant. Every course was outstanding and was something we would seek out back home. The pumpkin soup and sea bass were so amazing that we ordered them again on our 2nd night at this restaurant. Steakhouse - saved the worst for last. This was by far the worst meal we have had in years. 1 of our steaks was the consistency of ham - it was sent back and brought right back out with assurances that it was \"OK\". The bad steak combined with a bad mussel in the appetizer resulted in a day and a half of sickness and nausea afterwards. If you do go to this restaurant, be very careful about what you eat and make sure to pack immodium. ENTERTAINMENT - the nightly shows were much better than expected. The dancers/performers did a great job each night. We have been to shows in NYC and Vegas and found the shows to be very entertaining. It's not broadway, but they do a great job. Make sure to check them out each night. The prime seats in the theater fill up fairly quickly (starting at around 9:30), so get there early to grab a good seat if you want a good view of the show. During the daytime, the entertainment staff did a great job of making things fun by the pool and on the beach. The music by the pool was a little loud at times, but the staff worked hard to ensure that everyone was having fun. IN GENERAL - this is not an adults only resort, so there were a few kids there when we were there. My only complaint was that the parents didn't pay attention to their kids very much. Several kids were very rude and thought that splashing adults was a fun game. If you are averse to these types of antics, I wouldn't stay here. Also, we left right as the big spring break crowds started to hit. This isn't the hotel's fault, but the sheer number of high school kids running around would have made this a very different trip for us if we would have come a week later (lower drinking age in Mexico = lots of drunk high school & college kids = noisy resort).", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City Utah", "Title": "\u201cSub Par Hotel With Damp Beds and Weird Smell\u201d", "Author": "sanshi", "ReviewID": "UR58584492", "Content": "I am going to start with the negative aspects of this hotel, because that is why people usually read reviews. Everything in our hotel room was completely damp: the bedding, towels, couch, and eventually, our clothing and luggage. Spending a week sleeping in a damp, dank hotel bed was horrible. If you read the other reviews you will see that this was mentioned by many reviewers -- I should have listened to them and I regretted not having done so. What goes along with this dampness is a moldy smell that persists laundering. I just finished my first load of laundry and it still stinks! I don't know how to explain it other than a dank, pungent odor. The depth of this odor was not really apparent to me until we left the place but now everything we brought with us, from our clothing to our scuba gear to my purse, etc., reeks. I know this dampness is not caused by the mere fact that the hotel is in the tropics, because I've stayed in PDC many times before and never had this problem with utterly damp sheets and a moldy stink. Secondly, this place is run down and the decor is dated. It just seems worn out and used. It doesn't feel like you're in Mexico, but rather some stuffy French hotel. There are way to many fluorescent lights and the ambiance is totally lacking. If you are hoping for modern, contemporary, funky, edgy, cool or trendy decor this place is definitely not for you. Thirdly, the demographic was not what we were looking for. I am a 27 year old female and my boyfriend is 36. This place seemed to have a lot of people aged 50+ and families. Maybe we were just used to the two previous adults-only places in PDC that we've stayed, where there are mostly honeymooners. But anyway, it just seemed to have a much older crowd that places we've stayed before. Not a big deal but just noticeable. Fourthly, the restaurant reservation process is totally bogus. It is a complete pain the butt to leave whatever you're doing on afternoon of your vacation to go stand in line to make a reservation for an over-rated restaurant. Seriously, leaving the beach from 12-3 pm to head all the way to the front of the hotel to fight with other guests for a spot in line ruined the experience of vacation. I have stayed at other all inclusive places on the Riviera Maya where you are allowed to walk into the restaurant of choice at the time of your leisure, not at the two set times like at Riu Palace (6:30 and 8:45). What if you don't want to dine at the designated time or your don't want to leave your vacation activities to stand in line for a reservation? Well then its buffet time for you, in the flourescently lit dining room with boring decor. Also, they only let you make two reservations at once so you're guaranteed to stand in line for reservations at least a few times on your vacation if you don't want to go to the buffet. They also allow smoking in the restaurants which is gross. On the positive side, the food in the buffet was decent for a buffet, with good selection. Not much variety day to day. The service at the restaurants was good. The sit down restaurants were good and the waiters were prompt and friendly. It wasn't anything to write home about but definitely edible. The beach at this hotel is beautiful, better than each place I've stayed before. It is probably this place's only redeeming quality. Lots of spots to sit (many chair-grabbers early in the morning which is unfortunate) and beautiful sand and palm trees. However, again, the pool area is a bit run down and the lounge chair cushions seem to be have lived past their day. The drink service on the beach is nonexistent, which is really poor compared to other places I've stayed in PDC. The accessibility of this hotel to downtown PDC is convenient. It is only a short 10 minute walk and a cheap 50 peso cab ride. Overall, this place is a 3 star hotel, tops. If you have stayed at truly nice places you will think this place is a dump. I regret staying here.

We didn't have much time to plan the wedding, so we decided to do everything when we arrive(plus it was very hard to get in touch with coordinators while abroad). When we arrived to the hotel, we were told to meet the main Wedding Coordinator AEL at Riu Palace Mexico, why Mexico when we stayed at Riviera Maya, go figure? Well when we got there, we had to plan everything during this appointment. We had tons of things we wanted to do, to make this day special. Well, but for AEL everything was impossible or no allowed, or just NO! Those were the only responses we were getting from her. As we find out before the trip, we could have bring from outside of the hotel our Photograhper and Video person, BUT Ael said this is not allowed, and we would have to take her Crew, which were ridiculously Expensive! Well, we had no other choice but to take them. The other thing we wanted is to have our first dance during the reception, and music and dancing after it. But she Said NO again. As our Package said \"we pay up to 40 people\", and the cake was suppose to be 2 tier cake. But Ael said since we had only 18 guests we would get only one tier small white cake, with no decorations on it. Though we paid for the package of 40ppl. Well, last but not least the Decorations. We asked for Bows for the ceremony chairs, 4$ each. And wanted the same bows to be put at the reception chairs as well. Ael said the this bows would fit only the ceremony chairs (what a lie!), not the reception chairs! And that we only RENT them no buying (lie again). Well, then she offered flowers for the reception tables, terrible overpriced, like 75$ or 85$ for three flowers in a small vase. We decided not to take them. Instead we offered from the hotel flower book directly, and they made amazing centerpieces at 25$ each! Well, at the end of this \"nice appointment\" with Ael we were not happy that we decided to have a wedding at all!! Oh yes, another thing that pissed us, was the \"upgraded\" room we got with our package, which was just a regular room, with a bad bad smell in it! We were told the hotel is packed and we can't change it. Well, the good thing happened when we met with our hotel's wedding coordinator!!! ANILU!!! I can't thank her enough! She was so helpful! and made everything the way we wanted! We had the cake we asked for, the music, private reception area, and plenty pf room to dance!!! It was so good!!! she put the bows, and made beautiful table decorations with candles and rose petals on the tables! We had our own music , and could dance all night long!!! We had an awesome time!!! We did the ceremony on the beach! I would recommend it to everybody, cause you get amazing ocean view, and great viewers, lols (hotel's guests) Ok, photo and video people. Those were very over priced, even for New york standards. Our video package said 2 cameras for ceremony, and one for the reception (which all would be covered). At the day of the wedding, we met the video person who said ot was a mistake in the package and there will be just one camera, and she would cover only the begging of the reception dinner!!! Well, and of course there was n mistake in the price!!! 600$!!! Well, we had nothing to do, but to make it work. We got 30 mins video, not so well shot, and hardly edited. But I guess its better then nothing. Photo: EXPENSIVE! We had a package of 36 prints, and a CD for 36 prints, for 500$ The photographer was there only at the ceremony and half an hour after it . We bought the rent of the negatives from him for additional 100$! He was not good, took pics from the wrong angles, and his camera gives grainy images. But again, better then nothing :) Anyways, we had many ups and downs, but ended up having an awesome time and great memories! all of our friends and relatives were so happy that they arrived and spent this day with us! P.S. oh yes, forgot to mention, we got the room upgraded the day before the wedding!!! We got the best room in the whole hotel!!!", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cokay....not great\u201d", "Author": "likestotravel5", "ReviewID": "UR58390277", "Content": "If you are looking for a 5 star, this is not it.

The beach front had more than enough places to sit. I would recommend getting up early if you want to sit around the pool. Check out the saunas and hot tubs in the spa area. Our room was a junior suite and was very nice. We were disappointed in the noise level since everything echoed as people talked or brought their luggage down the hall. We enjoyed walking the beach and especially as the sun is setting. The colors were gorgeous. It's very easy to get into downtown either by beach or by taxi. Don't pay more than $5 per taxi.

One of the best things about our trip was all the amazing people that we met. All of the other guests there were so friendly and fun to get to know and hang out with. We took a few excursions- Chitzen Itza was wonderful, but a long day so be prepared. We also did a Sunset Dinner Cruise with Lobster and Steak. It was nice, but cold. The food was ok, but again we met wonderful people that made it so much fun. The beach was better than the pool because the pool was cold (but unseasonably cold while we were there-high 70's). I would recommend doing your research on hotels...we went to many to pick people up on our trek to and from the airport and RIU was by far the best! Having Playa del Carmen being so close is a nice alternative when you want to get off the resort. It's a 15 minute beach walk which is very nice.

They knew the baby's name, gave him kisses and patted his head, and always had a highchair waiting for us at our usual tables in the dining areas. They have a Kid's Club with a wonderful woman who keeps the kids busy and having fun (while parents get a break). Staff will babysit for you as well (for a fee). The ambiance at night is so nice, you sit outside and listen to the music or watch the nightly entertainment. Just note that when you go to bed, the music still plays until 11.30pm. We paid for the Junior Superior Suite so we could listen to the music and sit on our balcony people-watching. But for the kids, the noise was distracting during their night sleep. Oh well! The staff's efforts make every day feel special and they dedicate so much of their time to making sure you have a nice vacation. The beach is gorgeous now that the black sandbags have been removed and it is completely swimmer-friendly.

We were a group of 11 (2 couples brought 3 college age kids). Without question, the service and the friendly atmosphere of the staff was the best. The rooms were clean and towel animals were cute. Evening bed turn down service was a nice touch. Relaxing on the balcony for a while with a drink between pool time and dinner was great. The grounds themselves were beautiful and well maintained. We found the same spot to relax everyday, just off the pool area in the sand under the palms. It provided a good mix of sun and shade. People do get up early and reserve chairs with towels and other items. I wish they would enforce the \"no saving of chairs\" rule more. Since it was not an issue for us, no big deal. We saw 5 beachfront weddings during our stay - pretty interesting to watch and cheer along. Pool was great but a bit on the cool side (refreshing). Most every afternoon, we sat in the pool around one of the several in-pool tables and played some dice games while having some cool drinks. There were pool side activities each day but each day was pretty similar to the other. A little more variety might be a good idea. Whether you were on the beach, in the pool, in the lobby of at dinner, there was always someone asking if they could get you something to drink. Food was very good especially the breakfast buffet. Fresh fruit was awesome. The lunch buffet was also very good. We ate at 4 of the specialty restaurants, Steak House, Japanese, Brazilian & Krystals. Some in our group thought they were amazing, I don't think I would go that far. The steaks were OK but had a unique texture similar to tenderized steak here in the US. I guess they were good by \"Mexican steak standards\". Sushi was very good as were most of the wines they served with dinner. We never did understand why they chilled their red wines - maybe it had something to do with the heat/humidity. One thing that really disappointed me was that they did not have any fajitas. No fajitas anywere....bummer :>) The Guc and chips were the best. The dinks were good and like I mentioned, the staff was very accomodating. I would say they were on the weak side but that was OK. We did find a bit of inconsistancy in the way they were prepared. It seems like each bartender had his own recipe - some were very good some not good at all. The beer DosXX was very consistant... The 24hr sports bar was pretty cool too. Visited there a few times and even watched a few slices of the olympics. The college age kids with us visitied here a lot during the late evenings and early mornings... We did not spend much time watching the evening entertainment, what we did see was pretty good for a resort. As a side note. We arrived about 2 weeks after they completed the total beach restoration project. It is beautiful. It seems like the sand is more compact and a bit eaisier to walk on. We took a few walks and it was great not to navigate walls and sand whales anymore. I hope it lasts and does not wash away anytime soon. It was nice to walk to the town of Playa on the beach for once. This was a great trip and would recommend it to anyone looking to go.

This was our 1st time to this particular Palace. We have been to the Riu Palace Mexico several times before. Just wanted to try this one on for size! What can I say differently that hasn't already been said in many of the previous reviews? I mentioned above that this trip was unusual. What I mean by that is we have never been to Mexico in February before and upon research, we saw that this was supposed to be one of the best months to go. The weather was the \"unusual\" part of this. The 1st 2 full days, the sun was blaring! That's the way I like it! But on Wednesday it rained most of the a.m. & part of the p.m. The sun peeked in and out starting between 2-3 p.m. Thursday came with peeking sun and clouds but by evening it was downright chilly. Seeing all those little Mexican people trying to keep warm, well, it was a sight! Even a sweater didn't cut it for me! Friday was supposed to be sunny all day. Wrong!!! Overcast most of the day w/sun trying so hard to peek out!! Of course, on Sat., the day we were leaving around 7:30 a.m., the sun was blaring the way it should have been the whole week. We questioned some of the workers at the hotel about this and they said that the weather was \"unusual\". We knew something was up with the weather when we saw the surf. It was sooo rough! It's NEVER been like that before when we have visited. But enough about the weather. I am a Riu Class member and contacted them ahead of time like I was supposed to according to their policy about rooms. Needless to say, like almost every other time we have gone to PlaydelCarmen, they screwed up! After much haggling and only after demanding to see the supervisor, Karla, did we finally end up with great situated rooms. But we couldn't get into them until the next late afternoon. So no unpacking for that night! The food I felt was very good! Loved the \"Krystal\" restaurant (most popular) and \"Chili's\", the steak house! Our standard joke was that \"George\" went a long way. (the 1$ bill!) We didn't eat at the buffet the 1st night because we made VERY nice with Jesus @ Chili's and were able to eat there. After that we made nice again with Dania for reservations. Thank Goodness for that, though, since it was a very \"unusual\" time to do them. Between 12-3 p.m.!!! Mostly everywhere else we have been, it's early in the a.m. but this was nuts! I was more than delighted when I saw that the beach was back to the way it was before the hurricane damage...We had gone there after the hurricane and it was devasting to see just how much damage it did and how it wiped out 1/2 the beach. So I was excited to see what a great job they did in restoring it. Entertainment: Well, not the greatest but that didn't surprise us since the shows in all of the Rius are mediocore. Now here comes the real \"unusual\" part of the vacation! My husband can eat and drink with the best of them. He has a cast iron stomach or so I thought until he ate 1/2 a hamburger at lunch on Wed. He became violently ill for the whole rest of the day and evening. He didn't start to feel quite like himself until Sat., our travelling home day. Now that I think of it, he could possibly have gotten the nurovirus and the hamburger may have just been the topping on the cake. But he did say that the burger didn't taste quite right. So just a warning, if you eat lunch at Chili's beware of the hamburgers!! Other than that, everyone was so accomodating for every 1 of your needs. How can you complain about that? Oh! One more thing. If you want to get a lounge chair by the pool, people were putting their towels on the chairs extremely early in the a.m. I would say around 6-6:30 a.m. So if you want one, you know what time you'll have to get down there by to get it, ok?

We enjoyed the food at all the locations, but unfortunately we could not make reservations at Krystals. I didn't like the fact that you had to make the reservations 3 days in advance. The line for the reservations were very long and you could only make 2 reservations at a time. But the food at the buffet had a good mixture so you won't go away disappointed. The sushi was excellent and of couse the Mexican restaurant was very good. The sports bar has only sandwhiches, hot dogs and hamburgers and fruit in the refridgerator .

The lady at the front desk promised us a view, but it never materiallized, but for us the room was a minor factor. We took a tour of Tulum and then to Xei-Ha. Which was fabulous. If you go to Tulum you might want to pack a towel. They have a stairs that lead down to a littlve cove and lots of people were swimming. It looked absolutely fabulous. After Tulum our tour bus took us to Xei-Ha where we rode bikes to the top of the lake and snorkled back down. Lots of things for the kids to do. You can jump off a 6 - 10 foot cliff into the water, you can swim with the dolphins. See the Manatee. They have hammocks if you just want to take a nap. They have a little play ground for the kids. All you can eat lunch buffet that includes drinks, including alcohol drinks! Just a perfect day. The bus ride was a little over an hour because you had to pick up other guests from other hotels. The beach water was actually warmer than the pool water. If you like to lay out by the pool you better reserve your spot with your towel early because the sun hits one side of the pool better than it does the other side. (Sunny side by the Chili's restaurant.) We didn't care for the gym. A couple of the machines were broken. They didn't provide water in the gym or towels, but it is safe to run outside the resort.

Our stay was interupted by the beach restoration so the beach was closed for 2 days during our stay. When the restoration is done it will be a very beautiful beach but during our stay all we saw on the way to the beach and our walk along the beach was bulldozers, sewer pipes, and orange flags lining the beach for miles. They did upgrade our room upon check in to an oceanfront room which was actually restaurant front since if you stood on tiptoes and looked over the roof of the restaurant you could see the ocean. This ended up not being much of an upgrade since the beach renovations mostly took place at night while we were trying to sleep so all we heard was bulldozers for 3 nights straight. Room was okay. Definetely musty smelling. The couch had holes in it and the mirrors had rust spots. They did a good job of keeping it clean but it needed updating. Our bed was very hard. We requested a pad be put on the bed the second night and it took 3 askings and a tip to finally get it done. There were a lot of small lizards and bugs on the ceilings in the hallways but I guess that is the carribean. Food in the buffets, restaurants, room service was all average. There was a lot of variety and it definetely filled you up but nothing that made us say that was the best meal ever. Getting reservations to the restaraunts was a time consuming and annoying process. You wait in line for up to 30 minutes to find out there are no reservations left. We ate in the buffet almost every night because of this. The pool was big but very noisy. The pool DJ did not speak English very well and was constantly saying something into a microphone and the music was very loud so it was difficult to relax around the pool. If you were there to party and drink which a lot were then I guess it was okay just not our thing. There is a sign saying pool rules that no loungers can be reserved although if you weren't up to reserve a chair by 7:30am you weren't going to get one. There were towels laying on the chairs all day to reserve them but no people sitting in them. Staff did nothing to prevent this. This was especially a problem on the days the beach was closed. You are able to visit the other Riu resorts and we did but they were awful. We were glad we picked this place after those brief tours. The staff were friendly and all greeted you with a hello. It was within walking distance to Playa Del Carmen which is why we chose it. Don't count on the evening entertainment it was cheesy at best. We watched 10 minutes of a Grease rendition and had to leave it was so bad. Mostly lip synching and dancing at its worst. There wasn't much at all for entertainment during the day which was fine with us since we just wanted to relax. We did have overly priced massages at the spa which were good but the spa looks a little run down. This was an average resort. Nothing horrible but nothing great. It is a little on the formal side for us as it is designed to look like a palace. We prefer the tropical feel resorts so will be looking at other options for our next trip.

We were celebrating our 15th Wedding anniversary and upon check in we were upgraded to a room with a part view of the Ocean. The room was very comfortable, King size bed which was soft enough for us, LCD tv and small sofa. The room was kept very clean by our hard working maid. The minibar was also kept well stocked with beer, water and soft drinks. We tipped the maid and the minibar stockman the first day and then a little throughout the stay and received towel animals every day! Room service menu was small but the items were always tasty. On a few occasions though the food we had ordered was not delivered at all. When I phoned to ask about this they claimed to not know what I was saying so I just re-ordered and received the food eventually! Our first few days of the trip coincided with the beach restoration works that were taking place. This didn't adversely effect our holiday as we are very much pool people. Now if you like the pool then you'll either love this place or hate it. Firstly if you like shade around the pool this is the place for you. They have a lot of loungers but they are 75% in the shade of the palm trees. To get a lounger in the sun you had to be up by 0730 at the latest. Secondly if you like a loud party type pool again you'll be at home here. I really like to relax and read on holiday. Unfortunately due to the very loud music played at the pool I found this impossible. I would never come back to this hotel mainly for this reason. The waiter service around the pool area was very hit and miss. On some occasions the drinks were delivered quickly within 10 minutes. On others they would either not come at all or would arrive after 30 minutes by which time i'd already gone to the bar myself. This was even after tipping the guys. I think the problem was that they'd get the drinks then get called over by other guests and they would then give those guests our drinks ( I actually observed this and of course there was money exchanged!). The restaurants at the resort were on the whole pretty good. We dined at all the speciality restaurants and found the Krystal to be the best for the quality of food but a little amiss on the service. We dined there twice and on the first occasion everything was first class. However on the 2nd evening the waitress took our drinks order but drinks weren't served until i'd eaten most of the entree, even after reminding her on 3 occasions. The best restaurant for service was the Steakhouse which would of been first class but for their inability to cook a steak to medium. If you want medium you need to order rare in here! We also found the japanese to be good. The other speciality restaurants are ok but nothing special. The buffet restaurant was generally good and served some very tasty well prepared food. I did however have one incident which I thought was poor. On our 11th night, after being shown to our table, the waiter lent onto the table and gave me an earbashing about the shorts I was wearing that evening. Now he couldn't tell me what was wrong with them, I had worn them on a few occasions previously, but he said I shouldn't be wearing them to dinner. I found him to be rude and he left me feeling like a naughty child. I spoke to one of the head waiters and he said there was nothing wrong with my shorts but they were stopping people from wearing swim/bermuda type shorts. It was just an unfortunate incident which should not of happened. The breakfast service was excellent I especially liked the omlettes which were made in a unique parcel type way. Lunch was of a better quality in the buffet restarant but you had more choice in the chilis restaurant. The evening entertainment was ok. It was mainly different dancers who were always nicely skilled but not my cup of tea. We were looking forward to the Michael Jackson show but i found him very cheesy, he can't dance and doesn't sing, he just looks a little like him! The back up dancers were good though. We found the resort area to be very nice, clean and very safe. We visited the other Riu resorts in the area and thought they all looked very nice. We also went into Playa Del Carmen. The shops and restaurants were reasonably priced and it was a nice break from the hotel. I however wouldn't be interested in staying in any of the beach hotels in the resort as they seemed really crowded and didn't look very relaxing. We visited Chichen Itza and had a great day. The ruins and the stories behind them which the guide will tell you were really great. All in all we had a good time. I wouldn't recommend the Riu Palace Riviera Maya because for the money we spent it didn't deliver in a few too many areas. This is not the place to come if you wan't to relax around the pool during the day. If they'd just drop the volume a little i would of been happy to endorse this hotel.

The wedding took place right on the beach in the late afternoon. Beautiful background with the ocean. Spectators from the resort were off to the side and very respectful and told us how they enjoyed the wedding. What a great memory. All the details taken care of. We just showed up and enjoyed the ceremony. We can't say enough about the staff at the resort. Always had a smile and a \"Hola\" (hello) for everyone. We commented on how we did not run into one staff member that did not appear as if they were enjoying their jobs and helping to make our vacation memorable. GREAT staff in all deparments. The resort and grounds were spectacular. We were very impressed with how staff was always grooming and cleaning around the resort. Very clean rooms and kept up resort. Food at all the restaurants was great as well as the many choices of foods available at the buffets. Again, staff at all the restaurants were great. Everyone in the group seemed happy with the food and no one was every hungry or thirsty. Bartenders were great at all the bars as well as wait staff. Most of the time we didn't even have to go up to the bar to order a drink as the waiters/waitresses came to us. Staff on the beach were always quick to see an empty glass.

Ive stayed at 3 different Iberostars, Sandos, and Barcelo. I really liked them all, but this was the nicest. It can be confusing with the 5 different Rius. one is Riu Palace,,,, and the better one is Riu Palace Riviera. you can walk to all of them. this one is on the end of the line of hotels, sandos is at the other end about 12 hotels down. about 30 min beach walk to the end of hotels and then if you have the energy to keep going....it really gets pretty with no hotels. Beach great- way better than the hotels a few doors down that have hardly any beach. Beautiful shade with palm trees and hammocks for after noon nap after being down front by the ocean. No problem getting chairs. Food - really good for all inclusive. You of course have to go wait in line to get your reservations. We stayed 7 nights. you could make reservations 2 nights at a time. we always got what we wanted, but I did get in line right when they opened at 11am. Room - nice,,,, we did upgrade (had to pay $50/night more). We didnt like our first room that was a view of the other hotels roof. our upgraded room was courtyard, could see pool and ocean and fountains. Entertainment - it is a quieter place, the Swim up bar was a blast , but it shut down at 5pm just when things were getting rolling. then had to wait until 8pm for dinner, which was alot of time inbetween for me after \"happy hour\" My husband would nap and I would walk around with the kids. not much to do at our hotel, so we would walk two hotels over and play ping pong. Ive never paid much attention to shows at these places, but these shows were good..... at least if you are a dancer. My daughter is really into dance and they were VERY talented. not just the HOTEL staff perfoming (except one night, and it was funny). Sports bar - very disappointing. Was hoping our 12 and 14 year old could hang out there. it is very light and off the lobby. no fun. not much for teens, but they should be able to have fun with the beach and all the food! We went off property to scuba dive and Zip line,,,,,kids loved that. We also alway go into town one night.

The resort is absolutely gorgeous, clean, the staff bend over backwards for you. There are servers that walk the beach all day long taking your drink orders. The resort is all-inclusive and there is always food available somewhere at one of the many restaurants or the one main (enormous) buffet. Directly past the huge pool is the beach, tons of beach, and the ocean. The more affordable rooms at the resort do not have an ocean view, you will pay more for that, but our rooms were very spacious and very nice. There is breakfast, and lunch served every day at the humongous buffet and there are many themed restaurants on property with two nightly seatings. They have a muscial stage show every night around 8 in a room just off the large oudoor seating area behing the main building. No matter where you are in the resort there are servers waiting to take your drink order :) And if you should need more bottled water or towels in your room, as we did at one point, just call the front desk and they were there in literally 5 minutes. In the building the gym is in there are also two large hot-tubs that were very nice. One drawback we noticed is the lack of night-life. There is a sports bar with pool tables in the main lobby building that seems to be where the late crowd hangs, but 5th street with a ton of clubs and bars is littlerally a 10-minute or so cab ride away and very safe. There are also a few other Riu Palaces right down the street from this one and one of them does have a night club. This Riu is literally the nicest out of them all - as a guest you can visit any of the other Riu's and use their facilities - the same is not true if you are staying somewhere else and would like to visit this Riu. Most nights local vendors also set up tables selling a various amount of things and jewlery on the property and there is an outdoor market about a 5-8 minute walk away. I will post some pics and overall would HIGHLY reccomend the Riu Palace Riviera Maya for travel with friends, a romantic getaway, or even solo - it's wonderful.

Everything is a decent walk from the rooms. You have access to all the Riu hotels in this area, but after checking them out we stayed at ours. It was the nicer of the 5. The rooms are very nice if you upgrade to a superior suite so your facing towards the courtyard. It is best to get a room halfway between the lobby and pool. We had an issue with the fan almost falling off the ceiling, but after several attempts with dealing with the front desk, they sent a technician to fix it. He didnt think it was broken, but it was. After we persisted, he fixed it and realized he was in the wrong. This was the only issue we had. They weren't very nice about it. The food here is 10/10. Honestly, with the amount of 5* places I have been over the years, this place had the best food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even the room service food, was great. The have club sandwiches with chips. Ordered one most days. The service is also a 10/10, minus the people at the front desk in the lobby. The pool guys, the restaurant staff, entertainment staff, bar staff were super nice and efficient. The pools were warm, and the infinity pool was my favorite. The beach at this hotel was one of the best in the Mayan. No rocks, and they had sandbags to break the waves, which made it nice to lounge in the ocean. Lots of fish so bring your own snorkle gear. There are lots of beach beds, and palapas. There is a beach bbq with some of the best ribs Ive ever had in Mexico! I couldn't believe it. The drinks here are all premium brands, never a problem. The entertainment was only a 5/10 since there wasn't much going on during the day, few activities, and the nightly entertainment was just ok. Worst that Ive seen at the resorts Ive been too. It is a quiet place. It is not a party place. Most people at this resort are older. All the younger people go to the Tequila. I would go back here in the future.

A vacation is just that... a vacation. Take things in stride, relax, and you'll have a great time. The grounds are spotless, the restaurants and buffet are typical of all-inclusive restaurants, but are delicious, and the staff was super friendly. We had a fabulous vacation, and stayed there from 1/24-1/31. It was only cloudy one day, and the weather was mostly warm and sunny the entire time. We tried every restaurant there, and we enjoyed them all-- although there is some overlapping depending on what night you eat at the buffet. I actually really enjoyed the Brazilian restaurant (I'm not big on meat) but it was fun and highly recommended. While Kristal was good, I don't think it's worth it's wait (it took us 4-5 days to get a reservation there)... So overall, food is plentiful, perhaps breakfast was a little repetitive-- but no major complaints. Service was simply wonderful. We tipped, and had no problems getting excellent service, whether that meant a stronger alcoholic beverage, to non-stop service at the restaurant. People are friendly and outgoing if you make the effort, and the environment is very relaxed and enjoyable. One thing to note: the Mexican gov't is working on the beach, and when we arrived, we were one of the only resorts within 15 min. walking distance that had a nice, large beach. A lot of the other areas surrounding have a tiny beach, or it's been closed for a few days to try and place more sand there. So, this may be a problem if you are booking soon-- but the beach area at this resort is large, just be prepared to maybe look at some large pipes for a few days while laying on the beach. Walking to Playa Del Carmen was fun and safe, and only 15-20 min away. It was easy to navigate to, and there's plenty to see and eat and do there. There's also a small plaza for shopping towards the other Riu's-- where there's a Starbucks if you're craving it, about a 5 min. walk from the hotel. Otherwise, I thought that area was overpriced for shopping. Also, it was helpful to realize that in the sports bar at the resort, you can pay a few dollars and use the internet, plus there's boxed food in there-- which was much utilized when we left for our airplane ride home. The pool is nice, although typically crowded, while the beach area has much more seating. We never had a problem finding lounge chairs anywhere though. Plus, in the resort itself, there's plenty of bar/martini lounge seating EVERYWHERE, which was great. Our room was pretty basic, nothing special. We had a junior suite, and our mini-bar always seemed to be filled. Plus, there's 4 full-size bottles of liquor in there, which was pretty sweet. You can make a rum and coke right there! Our room was always clean, ours wasn't damp. We were on the 3rd/4th floor, so maybe that made a difference, but we never had any complaints. One recommendation: if you take a shower in the morning, expect hot/cold fluctuations in the water temp. I found if I took a shower between 3pm-7pm, I rarely had that problem. The resort is fairly quiet, we didn't really stay awake too much for the \"nightlife.\" We're in our late 20's, haha, and just enjoyed relaxing mostly. Plus, we ate most of our meals pretty late, but I heard the entertainment was just ok. I heard some people went into town, or went to other Riu's for more entertainment. We had more fun just chillin. Basically, this resort had superb service, had immaculate grounds, the food was tasty, the drinks plentiful (recommend bringing your own larger glass- as the glasses they serve are tiny). Plus, it was close to town, had the nicest beach in the area, and is really easy to find your way around. One other thing to note: the water/waves are a lot stronger than other places I've been to in the Caribbean (such as Punta Cana)-- I'm a little bit of a chicken and was only able to go in the water 2 days-- the rest of the time the waves were too big/choppy. Also, you can't really walk for miles down the beach, which we usually like to do. That was probably the biggest downside. However, that's a small gripe in comparison to having a wonderful Mexican getaway. You can walk through some pretty nice neighborhoods nearby, so I didn't complain too much. Overall, highly recommended. Would definitely stay here again, or at least another Riu Palace.

Past resorts that I have been to in the Cancun area include Gran Caribe Real, The Royal, Krystal Cancun, and the Flamingo Cancun.

One night even had langosta lobsters at the buffet. 2) Close proximity to other RIUs that can be visited. 3) Nice beach, friendly staff. 4) Short walk to Playa del Carmen for shopping and night life. Following are some disappointments from the trip: 1) The hydro-jets in the bath tub did not work. 2) There was a constant drip of water from the bathroom ceiling onto the floor. Didn't cause a problem but still annoying. 3) The mini-fridge is only restocked once per week, despite their twice a week claims. You'll run short on bottled water. 4) Limited selection of top shelf liquors (no Jack Daniels, exotic liquors other than Kahlua, etc.) 5) The music at night was not very good. It was keyboard synthesizer music intermixed with children's shows such as people dressed up as Eor from Whinnie the Pooh. We wen elsewhere for our evenings. 6) The internet service was down for a few days. The crowd at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya was not as social as other places I've been. Mostly European, there may have been a language barrier issue. I'd recommend this location for people who want a relaxing vacation, a nice beach, good food, and who aren't interested in the night life. It is not a place for an active night life or good bands (neither ethnic or contemporary) in the evening. Here's how I'd rate the destinations I've been to in the area for likeliness of a return visit: 1. The Royal (definitely a true 5 star) 2. RIU Palace Riviera Maya (4 stars, better food and rooms than Caribe)/Gran Caribe Real (3.5 stars, better night life and music than RIU) 3.

Our room was always cleaned in a timely manner. The room didn't have a musty smell but we found that everything stayed damp. Things never dried out (bathing suits, towels, etc). The food was OK. We always enjoyed breakfast at the buffett and never had any problem finding things we liked. Lunch was either at Chili's or the buffett and the offerings were (for the most part) the same each day. We ate at three of the specialty restaurants. The steakhouse (Chili's) was our favorite. The waiters were really good...make sure you or someone at your table orders the baked Alaska for dessert so you get \"the show\" that goes along with it. The Mexican restaurant and Krystal were OK. We at the rest of our dinner meals at the buffett. The beach was really nice. Plenty of chairs. The waiter service was hit or miss each day on the beach. We aren't pool people but as we walked to the beach each morning (around 8:30am), we saw that most of the chairs were already claimed by the pool. It seemed that if you wanted a chair by the pool, you would need to get up at the break of dawn to reserve one. We enjoyed going into Playa Del Carmen for shopping on a couple of days. We went once in the evening and once during the day. It's very nice and 'lots of shops to visit. I also did the Dolphin Swim at the Dolphin Discovery site. It was fun and was nice that my husband was allowed to take pictures while I swam with the dolphins. Overall, the resort and surrounding area are very nice.

It was a family vacation for our family of 4, (50 y.o. parents, 20 y.o. daughter and 13 y.o. son) We are from Portland, Oregon, so we were looking forward to a warm, sunny relaxing break from the rain. We booked the trip through TripGuy travel, and our docs said \"Funjet vacations\" The representatives in Mexico are Lomas travel, who provided our transfers. Transfers: Lomas travel reps were very easy to find outside the airport, and we were taken directly to the resort via a new Lincoln Navigator. Our driver did not speak much English, and we were exhausted, so it was a quiet 40 minute drive. Our return to the airport, was via a mini bus, with about 8 other passengers. Our hotel was the last pickup, so we drove direct to the airport. Our only complaint was that we got to the airport too early, and check in and securiy went very quickly, They picked us up at 2 p.m. for a 5:20 flight. I realize they need to allow for potential traffic delays and long lines at the airport, so it wasn't a big deal. Reception/first impression: The massive lobby is very impressive. Beautiful fixtures and furnishings and everything is immaculate. Our check in went very smooth, and we were greeted with a non-alcoholic fruit drink. (Tasted like Tang to me, but our son raved about it the rest of the week!) We had reserved a Jacuzzi suite and a Jr suite for the kids and had requested that the rooms be adjacent or connecting if possible. We made the long walk from receception to the very end of the building, excited to see our rooms. I was a little nervous, because we were on floor 2, and I knew the jacuzzi suites were on the top floor. Turns out, we were on the top floor, (near the lobby area there are a few rooms on an upper floor, which explained why the elevator showed a floor 3) The jacuzzi suite was absolutely amazing. At the end of the building, with a beautiful view of the ocean and pool area. Two huge windows on the ocean side and a smaller window on the side wall. The room was huge! (Bigger than our first apartment) The entrance is a hallway with the mini bar and liquor dispensers. There is a second door into the suite itself, which opens into a large sitting area, which has a couch, chair and tables and a large dresser. There is a ceiling fan over this portion of the suite. Off of the sitting room is a large walk-in closet with tons of hangers and shelves and the safe. The safe is on the floor, which made it a little difficult to read the instructions, or look inside to take items out. Would have been nice if it had been elevated on one of the shelves. From the sitting area, there are 2 steps up to the bed/bath area. There is another dresser at the foot of the bed, with a flat screen TV that could rotate so it could be viewed from the bed or the sitting area. Seperating the bed and the bathroom is a huge spa tub. The bathroom area is huge, comparable to the bathrooms at the Venetian in Las Vegas. there are 2 sinks, a huge, walk in closet, (kind of dark) and a seperate toilet/bidet area. The best part of the room are the balconies! The main balcony wraps around the edge of the building, and contains 2 chairs, a table, and a drying rack for wet bathing suits. Then there is a spiral staircase to the upper balcony where the jacuzzi tub is located. There is a chair and a lounger on this level. The view from this balcony is awesome! The jacuzzi tub took about 30 minutes to fill, and the temperature was a little hard to regulate, but it was very nice and private. There was a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries, a bottle of champagne, and not one, but 2 towel animals awaiting us in the suite! There was a new towel animal every day, and champagne and strawberries one other day during our stay. The junior suite was 2 doors away, and it was overlooking the resort next door. We had requested 2 beds for their room, and I was a little disappointed when I saw they were pushed together. They were huge, and our kids didn't mind, so we didn't ask for them to change the arrangement. Their room, while not as big as ours was nicley furnished and immaculate. It was comparable to any 3..5-4 star hotel in the US. There was a standard closet, and dresser, and a small sitting area with a loveseat, chair and table. The same TV that we had in our room. The bathroom was much smaller, but contained 2 sinks and a seperate toilet area, (no bidet) There was a tub shower in the spa tub. There was a towel animal to greet them, and they had a new one later in the week, but not a new one every day. The beds are quite firm. My husband and I found it to be quite comfortable, but after a couple of nights, the kids requested toppers and they were more comfortable with them. Our only complaint with our room was the air conditioning was not adequate. The kids room was much cooler and drier than ours. I think our room was warmer because of all the windows letting in the sun all day, but my husband thinks it was due to being an end unit, the system didn't have the capacity to adequately cool our room. We spoke to the front desk about it on our second day, and they said they would have someone take care of it, but it was the same for our entire stay. In any case, it was usually more comfortable to leave our slider open at night and get some fresh air. We were never really uncomfortable, as the ceiling fan kept the room pretty cool, and the weather was pretty Wi-fi: There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby area, but it is spotty. We had our I-phones and sometimes it would take several tries to get connected. Our last day, it was down completely. There is a business center in the sports bar, for pay, but we never needed it. Service: The service was fantastic, and we can't say enough nice things about everyone we came in contact with, from the doorman who first greeted us, to the front desk staff, to the waiters, bartenders, cocktail servers, housekeepers, and entertainment staff. If you needed something, you merely had to make eye contact with a staff member, and they were right there inquiring into your needs. They were all very friendly, and greeted you as you walked past. The pool bartenders and waiters were especially friendly and hard working, and knew our names after the first day. Our son, was very impressed by how friendly and attentive the pool bartenders were. You can imagine a 13 year old boy doesn't generally recieve a high level of respect from resort bartenders. Away from the resort, and even at the Riu to some extent, we encountered more people that did not speak English than on previous trips to Mexico. This is our first visit to the Yucatan, our previous trips being to the West coast of Mexico. It was never really a problem, but I think I'll brush up on my Spanish a bit before we retun to Yucatan. The hotel doesn't have a concierge desk, but there are representatives from different travel and tour companies in the lobby area every day. We met with the rep from Lomas travel, and arranged two excursions through him. Food: The food was good and plentiful, and available 24 hours a day. Though I have to say it was not as good as I expected. We had the breakfast buffet every morning, and ordered fruit, coffee and rolls a couple of mornings from room service. Lunch is also a buffet, out near the pool area. We ate dinner in the buffet a couple of nights, and tried the Mexican, Japanese and Steakhouse specialty restaurants. We could never get reservations for the gourmet, and weren't interested in the Brazilian. The variety of food available at the buffets is tremendous, but the quality is not exceptional, (especially of the meat) There was an abundance of fried things available, and always pasta, pizza, and a salad bar. Our 13 year old loved the buffets, and will especially miss the homemade donuts, and endless supply of pizza and french fries. The specialty restaurants were just OK. The meats were fair quality, and there was nothing exceptional about any of our meals. The seafood was especially disappointing, as it was obviously frozen. The room service menu is very limited, but is certainly adequate, and has something for every taste. We recommend the club sandwich, and the fruit plate. Our kids loved being able to order a snack in the middle of the night. The service was very quick, and after I tipped the waiter on his first visit, he always brought me a long stemmed rose! I realize that food preferences are a very subjective thing, and I should disclose that we are foodies, accustomed to dining at fine restaurants in the US. I was expecting food on par with that on a cruise ship, and it was nowhere close. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the highlight of our trip. Beach/Pool The pool area is absolutely spectacular, one of the best I've ever experienced. Yes the water is unheated, but I found it refreshing. We did have to do the early morning towel run to get prime location chairs, but it wasn't a problem and there were always tons of lounges available on the beach. The different features of the pool area were all very nice, from the infinity pool to the in-water lounges, to the swim up bar, and the bubblers. We thought the beach was great too, but it will be nice to get rid of the sand whales, so that you can body surf and really play in the waves. It would be nice to have an outdoor hot tub near the pool, since the only ones available at the resort are indoors in the spa. (they look very nice, but we didn't use them) Spa: While the guys were fishing, my daughter and I decided to have a spa day. First, we had a scrub/wrap, then a massage on the beach. The spa facilities were very nice, comparable to top spas at resorts in the US. The scrub/wrap was OK. I felt like they rushed through the scrub, but I was a little sunburned so that was probably a good thing. The wrap was nice, but what made it heavenly was the scalp massage. They asked if we wanted the massage on the beach or inside. It was a really windy day, but we had never had a massage on the beach, so we opted for outside. It was a little weird, because we had to walk through the pool area in our spa robes and messy spa hair in the middle of the afternoon to get to the little massage hut under the palm trees on the beach. When we got to the massage hut, we realized there were no walls or curtains, so we had a moment of panic contemplating the transition from our robes to spa tables. Not to worry. The masseuses helped us manouver under the towels without providing too much of a show for the nearby beach loungers. The massage was fabulous, but the combination of wind, beach and pool noise was not really a relaxing atmosphere. We concluded the beach massage would have been better in the early morning before the wind and pool noise kicked up. After our massage, we relaxed in the sauna a bit, before heading to our rooms to shower. There are showers and restrooms in the spa, as well as a full service salon and the hot tubs. Entertainment/Nightlife I regret that we only saw one show the entire week. It was the Vegas/Casino show. At first I thought it was a bit cheesy, but it got better and better and we realized the dancers were really good. We usually ate dinner around 6:30 or 7:00 and were in bed by 9 or 9:30! We were just too tired to stay up late, and the shows started at 9:45. The entertainment staff were friendly, but other than a few activities that our son participated in, we weren't really involved with them. I would have gone on the kitchen tour, but it was on a day that we were away from the resort. They did have live music in the plaza every night, and most nights there were vendors selling their wares. Personally, I felt the vendors cheapened the atmosphere, and a few were pretty aggressive, which was annoying, but I'm sure some people enjoyed the opportunity to shop right on the premises. Sorry this is so long, but I like reading detailed reviews.

The hotel design really doesn't compliment nor does it lend itself to the jungle surroundings.. for that, stay at the Iberostar Quetzel / Tucan. Hotel lobby is Spanish Colonial but somehow the interior hallways remind me of a hospital in Cuba with it's dank colours and echos. Enjoyed a 3rd floor, courtyard view, jr. suite, nice and private up there with vaulted ceilings and great ocean views. My only complaint was that the hotel was filled with loud Americans who had no respect for anyone else's trip, they seemed to yell across rooms, the lobby the pools etc., the Europeans and Canadians were much better behaved, dress more appropriately for off beach activities.. perhaps they've travelled more, regardless, I'd avoid this hotel if this concerns you. Rooms : Spotless, fairly new, great jacuzzi bathubs, huge king beds with great mattresses, new Sony Bravia LCD TV's with over 50 channels and at least ten English language ones. Decor, however is more reminiscent of a chateau in a cold climate and does not convey a tropical, fun, holiday mood. Pool : Large with tonnes of loungers, no need to get up @ 5:00am unless you want one at key locations poolside. Great pool bar staff, a little tip goes a long way, you'll get chairside service with you favourite drinks every time. Terrible, loud music, rap and oldies from a bygone era, I thing they have about 3 home made CD's that they repeat constantly. Pool is not heated, people seem to complain but the purpose is to cool you off, it feels great once you're in a does the trick. Why would people want a hot pool when it's 30C outside? Beach : Massive hotel beach from, with huge coconut grove ensures loungers and shade for anyone, anytime, no need to panic. Buffet Food: Best we've ever had at any all inclusive, period. High quality, huge variety and changes nightly. International night was phenomenal, with massive payayas, carving stations, freshly made dessert crepes. Town: Get to town and blow a few bucks on the great collection of modern, slick and hips bars and restaurants a few blocks down 5th Avenues, go past the first few blocks of tacky Mexican shops and you'll discover a jet set, stylin' scene! In conclusion, if it wasn't for the Americans that seem to take over and are oblivious to anyone else's space, this place would be great and get a full five stars from me.

The airport staff was not helpfully at all. When we finally arrived at the hotel we were very tired. The hotel took great care of us. We requested and received a very private and quit room. The service at the hotel was great! When in the morning before breakfast I asked them if they could give me a bottle of water for the beach, the staff told me that they will take it to my room and when I come back from breakfast it will be waiting for me there. True enough! it was there. We wanted to change beach towels in the middle of the day, no problem. The room service at first was so so. The lady pretended to not understand me when I asked her for more towels and showed her the towel by picking them up from her cart and taking them in. I went to the front and asked them to translate to her that I wanted two more bath towels for my room, from then on we had not issues at all. The food was great. It tasted fresh delicious and varied greatly from day to day. I gained ten pounds in ten days, so be careful! The service at the buffet was very good. We did not have to wait in line to get in at all. The specialty restaurants were not that great. Considering that the food at the buffet was so good and the fact that we had to get up at 6 am to get reservations! not worth it. We did it only twice! Japanese restaurant was not very good and the sushi as well as the service was so much better at the buffet. The beach was fantastic. The white sand was pumped up from the ocean every day. The beach was clean with plenty of room, so it was not at all overcrowded. They had huge bags filled with sand dumped in the ocean to break the waves. The beach was calm and the bags became the attraction to which people tried to swim to and get on. We met so many different people from all over the world. The hotel staff made everyone fell very comfortable. For the first time in my life I played darts and had fun doing it. Since everyone was in the same boat we all had fun. The Service at the beach was fantastic. Servers with the drinks were walking around all the time. At first I did not feel comfortable waiving them down. I would go to the bar to get my Margaritas, which by the way were very very good! By the end of vacation I did what everybody did and got my drinks from the servers. The food was great. We did not even have to leave the beach. There were two restaurants right on the beach, as well as the hotel would bring out the barbecue right onto the beach and cook right there in front of us. They would bring fresh fruit and cold drinks as well. To go to the beach restaurants you need shoes and a cover. By the end we were to lazy to do it and ate lunch right there on the beach. It was great! The resort has swimming pools. They were very nice but we spend the whole day on the beach. We were scheduled to go on a trip and I asked them if I could take some food for the road. There were not problems with it at all! We were the only onces who had decent breakfast that day on a bus. If you do decide to go on a trip make sure that you choose a company with the large tourist bus. It has good air conditioner and has comfortable seats. You will appreciate this later when traveling on Mexico roads and the bus going above speed limit! Little buses like minivans are to be avoided! We went to see the pyramids and had great time. One thing, the tour company takes you only to the shops that they have agreement with. BARGAIN AND MORE BARGAIN. I do not usually feel comfortable bargaining so I was out of my comfort zone and did not buy anything. At the pyramid there is a market. When at the end of the day we were leaving and I still did not buy anything I got bold. My husband was laughing at me. The was a stone statute that I thought my parents would like. At the store before and at the market they wanted between $75 and $100. I told them at the end of the day at the market that I will pay only $25 and prepaired to walk away. I thought that yes,yes or no,no, but at least I tried. At first they tried to bargain with me but when they so that I was serious they run after me. So I was very proud of myself.

We stayed at the RPM a few years ago and do prefer this hotel. Although this a beautiful building the resort doesn't have a very Mexican feel to it and some Mexican music would have a good way to putting this right. The main plus for this hotel is the staff, they are fantastic, without exception, from the \"maids\" to the drinks and restaurant waiters. Rooms were spotless and we never waited for service anywhere. There was a slight difference the second week we were there when I think our room was placed at the end of the daily cleaning schedule and following a couple of trips out, our room hadn't been cleaned before we returnd at 16.00. We're not very good at sitting still and went out of the hotel most days. The hotel is well situated for the short walk (15 minc) into Playa del Carmen or to go to places such as Xcaret, Akumal, Tulum etc. The beach was exclellent and in much better condition than I'd expected, although the sand whales are not pretty. If you turn right on the beach you can walk to the undeveloped part of the beach which is stunning and even stop off at one of the other RIUs along the beach for refreshments. We had a view over an adjacent hotel which was rather dull but just provided some balcony space for a short time with dos equis from our well stocked mini bar. We found the food to be good overall but it did get boring towards the end of the second week.

First time also to the area, having done Cancun without child years ago. Chose hotel for its all inclusive factor and its location to Playa Del Carmen. Used Thomson package holidays which again, not something we usually do, but thank god we did (see snowstorm/flight delays). No delay going out from an extremely cold and snow-ridden UK. Had a First Choice flight (rubbish) but we were going to Mexio so put it behind us. We pre-booked private transfers to hotel which were fine and journey to hotel takes about 45 mins. Upon arrival, we received cold drinks but were given a bad room. Apparently no courtyard views available apart from for an extra $50 a night and even then, we would have to wait two days. Said no thanks and got on with it - never in room anyway and it turns out the room is right by the pool and beach so shorter walks when something was needed from room midday. Long walks to main building but nice at night with Christmas lights up. Did get the impression that Thomson holiday makers do not have much push here, despite it being a \"Thomson Hotel\". That mean't nothing when requiring a little upgrade or extra help... This I had suspected before booking. The hotel is nice - all crystal chandeliers and old-style glamour but newly built. It is large but after two weeks, you got used to it and realised that being so big would mean that it never felt busy - apart from pool area... We arrived on Boxing Day and it was nice to see all the Christmas displays up - our daughter said it made her not forget Christmas Day so quickly. We ate in the buffet that first night. We were actually impressed! The last all-inclusive place we had been to was 12 years ago in Cancun, which we remembered as being quite nice but it didn't ever feel so \"special\". Deciding to cut costs on this trip, we chose the all-in option but had vowed to eat out assuming the food wouldn't be up to scratch. In fact, the food was so up to scratch that we actually got fed up with eating! I admit that nothing was really hot unless served up by the chefs up front, though for me being semi-vegetarian (let's just call it extremely fussy) and my partner having a penchant for fresh seafood and top notch sushi, we found it more than acceptable. I even ate their Chilli Con Carne and found it fine whereas you would never see me eat meat or chicken in most decent places. They made an effort and would alter something if required. We ate in the Steakhouse, Japanese and Krystals and can honestly say, that there is nothing more demeaning than having to wait at lunchtime to try and get into restaurants that are actually cooking the same level of food that is being served for free every night in the buffet. We waited once and agreed never again - simply ridiculous! All Krystal had done was make haute cuisine portions and added a little foam/jus here and there! It is a little nicer to be served, though we found ourselves wanting to get the whole food process out of the way and just plot up somewhere nice to drink and relax. Lunch is buffet style but noisier and with people wearing swimwear - this didn't bother me as we were in an all inclusive and I get the impression that casual and relaxed is what they were going for. You could still get a drinkable glass of wine and it mean't that kids could get their refills on drinks and ice cream. Must point out that we never saw a fly or wasp near the food during the whole two weeks, but were unable to eat at Xcaret because of their insect takeover. Beach was nice - water warmer than pool, but that was freezing so that says nothing much given the time of year. Sea was clean though not as clear as you might expect. The sand-whales are merely a slight eye-sore, but nothing worse than clocking us podgy types walking around with bikinins on!!!!! We didn't let our daughter play on them as they appeared slippery, but many did. There was fantastic waiter service on the beach though I wish their cups were bigger - one coke when thirsty doesn't touch the sides! The pool area - well, what can you say? The bed reserving situation was the worst that I have ever witnessed. We bagged some beds once only because we sent Daddy out at seven a.m. to get them. He was not amused and therefore we used the beach 90% of the time - we don't like the noisy pool and they music going, entertainment team making announcements and there is also the fact that they cram the beds together so you have to get up close and personal with semi naked strangers. This isn't a favourite past-time of mine. My biggest moan: PLASTIC SUNBEDS!!!! I understand that it would cost some money for the hotel to deal with this, so I will leave it at that. Maybe just the pool beds... Room had ants in bathroom. I can deal with this as I understand that we might have sweet smelling toiletrires in there (and once, we poured away the last of daughters' orange drink - big mistake!!!). You would think the maids would spot the little bu**ers and use an insectocide on them, but no. We overlooked the hotel next door, so quite private but not an enjoyable view. Plastic balcony furniture.... Our daughter received a Towel Animal/figure daily, which she looked forward to seeing every afternoon. We tipped them every other day about \u00a35 and they really looked after us (apart from ants!). We found that small tips here and there didn't make a difference at all. The staff worked so hard in all areas to be punctual and professional and it was only the front desk that I felt had this \"I should be working in the Rosewood Mayakoba\" attitude. Big tips made them thankful but they couldn't smile or work any harder than they already were. There is soooo much to do around this way - trips/excursions etc. We will return to complete our Thing To Do list. You only need to do things the once, like swimming with dolphins or a day at Xcaret, but you remember those days more than the sunbathing. TIP: We flew to Chichen Itza in a tiny plane that seated five. We are a family of three and the allowed us to pay for an empty 4th seat to have the day exclusively. SO worth it!!!!!! Riu Palace Riviera Maya was better in appearance than the Palace Mexico but we were told the nightlife is better in the \"less star rated\" hotels. We went in to Playa Del Carmen for shopping many nights and ended up eating and drinking there. Its safe and casual with plently of walking. Nothing major shop-wise but some nice little boutiques. We will return to the area but maybe try somewhere different. Our daughter had a fantastic time - plently of kids to play with (all nationalities) and loved the shows at night. We met some fabulous people which really made the holiday for us. Finally: The snow in UK meant a 16 hour delay for us. We met with the Thomson rep, Emma, who had already been more than helpful with other issues and with booking trips etc. She let us know about the delay, what to do and was on hand at all times. Being booked with Thomson meant we stayed at the hotel for the extra day and did not have to do anything other than prepare for the new flight time.

Our daughter (being by herself) didn't see them when she arrived and waited outside for almost 3 hours till we landed. I was really hoping that she would have gone ahead and went to the resort. It worked out. Check In: We arrived around 6pm and we not greeted by anyone with a nice cold cocktail. We previously asked for connecting rooms but none available. We booked a courtyard view but when we got to our rooms we were looking into the back of the steakhouse rest. on the first floor.

They then gave us two more rooms over looking the courtyard 2096 & 2098. beautiful rooms but 2098 had peoples belongings in it. Our key took us inside. Luckily our bellman was still with us and he called the front desk. They then switched us to room 2090 which is above the buffet rest. with a larger balcony. Rooms: very nice. no problems with musty smell or bugs. Water temp and pressure was great. Housekeeping very prompt. Pool: very cold, not heated. Hate to say but people were out by 6am reserving chairs. We were there for 7 nights and only had 2 days were we had good seats at the pool. That's only because I played the game. hated this. Towel keys are the only way you can get pools towels and only 1 per key. Rest.: Out of 7 nights we were only able to book 2 nights at the ala carte. We ate at the Mexican and Krystal both being very good. You have to make your reservations between 12 & 3. They did a Christmas Eve buffet (only rest. open) with 2 seatings. We opted for the 1st seating. It was very beautiful and very good the only proplem being it was very crowded. We tried waiting till lines went down but when we were enjoying our dessert they asked us to hurry so they could turn the room for 2nd seating. Beach was very nice. Sand bags were not bothersome at all to us. Water was a beutiful blue and water temp. was warmer than the pool. Shows: We were told the Michael Jackson show was the best. It was never scheduled while we were there. Other shows just ok. Location: We loved walking (20 min.) into Play del Carmen. Great being able to walk into the other RIU's. We like the animals/jungle feel walking thru the tequila property. We also thought that our hotel was the nicest of all the other RIU's. Drinks. They do only serve Dosequies (spelling?) beer. Liquor selection ok. Absolute, Finlandia Cranberry was what we usually drand. We had our 20oz bubba kegs which were great! Our flight home was canceled due to the flight crew being timed out. So we opted to stay another 3 days but we moved to Cancun and stayed at the westin. Cancun transfers were prompt picking us up and taking our daughter to the airport and us to the Westin. That was very much appreciated with no extra charge. All in all if you are on a family vacation this is a very nice place.

Overall, I would say that it is nice. Just some pointers: Cleanliness: very clean. As noted by other reviewers, staff were always cleaning the public areas. We even saw two women mopping outside under a balcony while it was raining! Food: the main buffet we thought was great and ate there for every meal except for one night at Chili's, where I had the tenderloin and lobster tail...melt in your mouth steak. On a side note, there were a few stray cats begging for food by the tables which I, as a cat lover, didn't mind and probably encouraged by giving some morsels away to one who waited patiently at my feet. My spouse, who hates cats, was not so amused. It is an outdoor restaurant, on the beach. The lunch buffet there was also good too. Room: nice. I loved the jacuzzi tub, but as others noted, the water temp in the shower was sporadic during peak times. Be careful if you have children and you allow them to shower because the temp is way, way, way too hot at times. Better luck using the tub, in my opinion. The balconies and patios are pretty private, with high walls between, which is always nice. We never received towel animals or turn-down service during our stay, although we left a tip every morning of $3 (maybe not enough?)...the room staff seemed like they were short-staffed or something. Beach: nicest in the immediate area, as far as I could tell, but we only walked south a ways to the RIU Yucatan. The sand \"whales\" are ugly, but the water itself was that gorgeous shade(s) of blue, so we didn't mind. Room service: used that every night. was just ok. very small menu and not the best of food, but we were usually too tired by then to care. Try to hit the buffett before they close at night. Bars/nightlife: We did see the Michael Jackson show, was pretty good impression of him, and the dancers were very good. The sports bar was nice for my spouse so he could get his sports fix, but I liked the ambience of the lobby area more. The red wine at the main buffet is very, very smooth...wish I had thought to ask what it was. Playa del Carmen: We took a cab in and back, very efficient. We just walked 5th Avenue. We both thought it was interesting and unique, but both of us disliked some of the vendors who were very pushy. If you're like me and have a hard time with seeming impolite, practice saying \"no, no, no...\" or you will be dragged into shops. I even had vendors physically blocking my exit, I felt, to keep me in their shop. I liked the bigger shops, where you are left alone, and I'm always amused by Mexican pharmacies, so that was fun.

The food is very good and if you can make the effort of walking 50 metres then you can book one of the restaurants. Krystal and the Mexican were the best , the Brazilian was the worst and is to be avoided. I can recommend the soups which are always available at all restaurants. The rooms are fine , as in all hotels the location of some rooms are inevitably going to be better than others . Rooms towards the sea and overlooking the plaza on the upper floor can be recommended. Keep the balcony doors closed and the air conditioning on at all times and the mouldy smell which was present when we entered the room went very quickly. It is a warm humid climate !!! I have enjoyed reading some of the whinging reviews written by people who were at the hotel during our stay. We stayed at the hotel for two weeks , therefore we may have rested longer and chilled a little more than the short break folk who seem to have had a totally different holiday to the majority of people who were there at the same time. Overall all the staff tried very hard to make our stay enjoyable, every member of staff always say Ola . Treat them with respect and they will become your friends , talk to them and you will be the wiser . Many of the staff have Mayan heritage of which they are very proud.The Mayans used to use chickens as currency - the Mayan word for a chicken is k'ash , which we know as cash ! The trip to Coba we organised by taxi ourselves by organising with a taxi outside the hotel the day before we wanted to go , it cost $100 , we went to Coba , got ourselves a native local guide inside the gates , he was born and bred there he was 73 years old and was fantastic and cost 300 pesos.On the way back our taxi took us to a great beach bar at Paraiso , which was a lovely spot.

All the people helping, either cleaning the rooms, helping with check in, or serving food and drinks, were always working very hard and being extremely friendly. If you ever needed anything, it was easy to get help and they would get it done quickly. -Everything is kept very clean. Everyday they did deep cleaning on everything. The walkways, beach, restaurants, bars, and hotel rooms were kept very clean. -They had different activities to participate in or watch on each day. -The beach is beautiful and the swimming pool area are both very nice with a swim up bar at the pool. -The bed is comfortable and the room is very clean and has a pretty good amount of space. - The resort is only about a mile from town so one can easily walk in if they want to shop. - They do have free wireless internet services but you have to be in the main lobby area to use it. If you want it in your room you have to pay for it. - This is more of a review of the area but there are many different attractions to see (Tulum, Chitchen Itza, etc.) and they do sell trips to the different ones in the lobby. They are a bit more expensive in the lobby than in town but that way they pick you up right in the lobby and drop you off there which can be convenient. ONLY TWO COMPLAINTS: - The shower's water temperature would not stay constant if showering at a time when many other people are showering. (sunrise, sunset) The temperature would be constantly going from cold to hot the entire time. It wasn't happening rapidly so one could step in and out without getting cold but it was frustrating. -This complaint is not from me, but one of the people in our group was discontent because the only beer that they offered was Dos Equis.

I wanted the best resort in my price range that was walking distance or a short drive to Playa del Carmen. Wow, were we impressed. My wife has travelled extensively and was thoroughly impressed with the entire experience. She was pleasantly surprised at how many staff spoke english, and well at that! We checked in late on Saturday, November 28th for a 7 day stay. The hotel was at capacity, so we got a ground level garden view room. We upgraded to a second level courtyard view room on Monday. The view was fabulous. We had views of the pool area and the terrace patio. The beds were hard, but we sleep on a hard bed at home and prefer that over a pillow-like mattress. It's good for your back, remember. There is a bar rail in the room, but we only used it when we got there and once more. There are bars everywhere and who wants to stay in their room? The breakfast buffet was great with sufficient variety for everyone. We found the coffee to be horrid, however. There is a Starbucks 5 minutes down the street for those who want it. We just 'settled' for a mamosa or two everyday :) The lunch buffet was great. There was enough there for me to like to avoid having to eat what I didn't like. I especially liked the serving station in the middle, where the guy made wonderful tacos and freshly tossed, customized seafood salads. His dish changed every day. The pool bar and wait staff..what can I say. They were fabulous and always a hoot. Word to the wise: bring your own large, insulated coffee mugs. It will save you from going to the bar frequently. We drank our Mojitos in the coffee mugs, and had sufficient quantity to walk the beach and refill at Riu Playacar or Riu Palace Mexico. We personally found the Mojitos better from the guy at the beach bar at Riu Palace Mexico, but it's all good :) The beach was fantastic. We spent most of our time on the lower beach, as there isn't much room on the upper beach that isn't obstructed by palm trees. For those wanting shade, lying under a palm and reading a book while hearing the waves is a wonderful experience. You will see some topless women on the lower beach and at other resorts we walked past. What's wrong with a little European? We only spent the first full day at the pool area. We found it a bit loud with kids and activities and preferred the beach. The well located loungers get reserved very early, so you must be an early riser for a good spot. The dinner reservation system needs improvement. Who wants to line up between noon and 3 to make reservations? You've paid to be in the sun, not be indoors. At the very least, they should move it to a morning slot, let's say 9am. My wife stayed in the sun and I got there at 11:30 to beat the rush. I was in the first five every time. I say the men should suck it up and do the deed while the women stay in the sun. Krystal is by far the best restaurant there. It books up the quickest, as a result. Eating there three times, we had pretty much the entire menu. The beef tenderloins are to die for. The tuna on hummus was very good, but could be cut thicker. The shrimp ravioli and Chillean sea bass were both great. We would go there every night if they had a larger menu. The Japanese place was good. I found the sushi to be acceptable, but hey, this is a Mexico all-inclusive, not some fine restaurant in Canada or the U.S.. My beef dish was very good. The steak house is apparantly the second most popular, but I found the steaks to be unexceptional. My lobster tail was overcooked and difficult to scoop out. The side dishes of fries and ceasar salad were unimaginative. Again, it's an all inclusive, not a fine dining restaurant. We didn't bother with the Mexican and Brazilian restaurants, but were told the Mexican is good and not to bother with the Brazilian. We did a lot of walking on the beach, and checked out all the other Rius, as we had free access. Riu Palace Mexico is essentially the same blue print, but on a smaller scale. The pool area is broken up and underutilized by patrons. Everyone there was on the beach, and what a walk to the beach! Wow! Make sure you don't forget anything in your room, or it's a long trek. As such, our Palace is better. Plus, its newer. The other Rius don't even compare to RPRM. We spent one evening just walking at Playa Del Carmen. Although friends absolutely love 5th Avenue, we found it a bit tacky, reminding us of typical tourist oriented shops selling tacky stuff to tourists, like Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls. Next time, we'll try a restaurant or bar, but really, can it compare to Krystal and the experience at RPRM? Just my humble opinion. Would we go back? Definately! Without a doubt. Is it worth spending a little more than for the other Rius? Definately!

But, I ended up being a hero! The Riu Riviera Maya is AWESOME. The service was outrageously wonderful. Of course a couple of dollars here and there went very far with them. To those who comment the service was bad - I honestly think you got the wrong resort on your review. Many reported that there was a \"musty\" smell - but I'm pretty sure they must have stayed at the Riu Palace \"Mexico\" - which, while still nice was not like the Riviera Maya. We visited the Riu Palace Mexico and definitely noticed the smell right away. On the contrary, the Riviera Maya smells like oxygen and roses - if that makes sense. If you stay at the Riviera Maya, you get to visit and eat at the other Riu resorts which are all lined up on the beach - each walking distance on the road or beach. The buffet was nice. Some reviews said the food was just \"ok\". That depends on what you like. They serve a variety of foods to appeal to both American, Mexican, German and British clients - and some Americans might not be too keen on the German and British fare. I'm American and my husband's family is all British - we all LOVED the food, though. The beach was glorious. I don't know what people were talking about when they suggested that water shoes were a must - a \"must\" for who? My feet were fine...the entire 10 days we were there. The entertainment was entertaining. I wasn't expecting a \"Vega\" show - so maybe that's why I wasn't dissatisfied like some of the other reviews I read.

Staff: extremely friendly and accommodating! Quick check-in and every time we needed something they responded quickly.

Never had any trouble getting drinks or service in the restaurants...there were a couple of times when it took longer, but we understand we are not the only guests in the hotel and don't expect to be waited on hand and foot. Entertainment is typical resort entertainment...they brought a few vendors to the resort to sell stuff. You're much better off going into town or down the street to the little market to buy souveniers, prices are better. We watched the Mayan show and the Mariachi show and both were entertaining and fun. Please tip the staff...they work very hard and deserve it very much.

We enjoyed just lounging by the side, they had a few activities and a volleyball net. Good service at the pool for drinks, etc. Always greeted with a friendly \"hola\"! Clean and the water was just the right temperature...very refreshing after laying in the hot sun. Beach: awesome!!! I was worried that the sandbags would ugly up the beach and limit access to the water, but it wasn't like that at all. There were always a ton of sea birds hanging out on the sandbags and the occasional pelican or two! I did miss being able to play in the larger waves, but no complaints. Water was warm and beautiful, and there were even some little fish swimming around out by the sandbags that would swim right around your feet. Food: typical buffet food you would expect at an all-inclusive. Remember they are feeding large quantities of people so the food is not going to be gourmet. Never had a problem finding food that we liked...and the pico de gallo and guac were so yummy! Lots of fresh fruit and veggies and awesome desserts. Breakfasts were exceptional, the omelet station was nice, and always a good variety of food...and fresh fruit smoothies!!! We ate at two a la cartes...Krystal and the Rodizio. Both were good...if you go to Krystal you MUST EAT the passion fruit bon bon...best thing ever! The chocolate cake dessert was very rich. Rooms: very nice, we weren't in our rooms much anyway. There is a musty smell, but it's that way at any beach area due to the humidity. Not a big deal. Balcony was nice, we could sit out there and overlook the resort. The only drawback was that our room was right above the courtyard and the nightly entertainment was very loud...and went until about 11 p.m. But we accepted that and didn't request to move...we're pretty content travelers. We did have towel animals and turn down service a few nights, very nice touch! They even brought us new towels with chocolates one night. Other: we went to Cozumel one day to snorkel and I would highly recommend using Eagle Ray Divers! It only ended up being my husband and I and one other couple...so nice to go with a small group. It was pretty much an all day event, we got to snorkel for about two hours on an uncrowded reef. Our guide, Said, was amazing and showed us lots of cool stuff. Highly recommended, and not overcrowded on a big, speeding boat like a lot of snorkel tours...it was very leisurely and fun. Afterward, they took us to the Money Bar Beach Club right on the shore and lunch was included. Best food we had the entire trip...highly recommend the chicken tacos and the steak burrito. YUM! All in all another great stay...we have also stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico down the road, and the Riu Club Hotel Negril in Jamaica.

On the positive side, the hotel is very luxurious and clean. The staff can't do enough for you (and this is despite the fact that we did not tip any of them until the last day). The main buffet was good - sometimes some of the items were a bit hit and miss but there is so much to choose from it really doesn't matter. The reservations system worked well (although perhaps that's because we were there for 2 weeks - I can see how it becomes a problem if you are only there for a few nights). Krystal was the best - in terms of both food and service. The others were ok - mexican was good, the others were not quite so good but still worth the experience. Some of it did replicate the main buffet food but just in a more intimate setting. Room service was great. Yes, the choice was a bit limited but the quality was high and the food/drinks delivered were plentiful. Always delivered on time and with a smile. Staff more than happy to deliver bottles of wine to the room. Mini bar was handy and stocked regularly. Room was turned down every night (except the few nights we stayed in). Room was cleaned to a high standard every day. Everything was on hand - not far at all to walk to any of the amenities. We had an outward facing room - balcony overlooking the next door property. Not the best view, but more than aceptable, particularly given that we didn't upgrade the room option. Front desk staff were more than helpful. We needed replacement wristbands, room key cards and change on a couple of occasions and they were great. We also cheekily asked them to make our restaurant reservations for us on the days we were away from the hotel and they did so (without being tipped!). Room quickly got damp due to humidity but only if we were daft enough to leave the balcony door open! Provided we left it closed and left the (highly efficient) AC on, the room was perfect. Xel-Ha was a nice day out - we saved a lot by organising this from a stand on 5th avenue (Eagle Rider/Ricardo - recommended) - we paid $90 each. Our Thomson rep wanted $119 each. The entertainment in the hotel was good. The entertainment staff never seemed to stop! Some of the shows were a bit predictable but some of them (especially the Michael Jackson tribute!) were brilliant. There was also loads of stuff going on during the day but only if you chose to get involved, we didn't. Plenty of loungers always available both by the pool and on the beach. On the slightly more negative side, my partner tells me that the matresses were too hard (I liked them!) and it did seem to us that the beach bar staff operated on a tips basis. We didn't tip and he made it obvious he wouldn't be bringing us any more drinks! This was the only occasion of this. We also noticed them taking bribes in exchange for drinks/food from other beach sellers (especially when the beach/mobile bar was in operation). Note that there is very little hassle from beach sellers generally. I was only approached a couple of times and they just walked on by with no fuss. My partner booked a pack of 8 dives with the 'Scuba Caribe' outfit on the hotel beach and was disapointed with the experience. He has dived all around the world and never experienced such problems/hassle with entry and exits from the water/dive boats. Really quite dangerous - especially when the sea is rough/choppy. The dive staff were friendly and the Cenotes dive was good (although operated by another company) - it's just that the Scuba Caribe facilites and equipment don't make overall for a very pleasant experience. We did a day trip on the ferry to Cozumel - not the best use of time. Although it's a nice place, the whole of the town is really just shop after shop selling the same junk to tourists/visitors from the cruise ships. So, unless you are going to hire a car and get out of the town, I wouldn't bother. We intended to hire a car and booked one in advance but on arriving to collect (Rooster car rental) were told that no matter what we paid for in terms of insurance, we would never be 100% covered. The best they could offer was 80% (which we thought was insufficient, given that he told us the vehicle was worth some 80,000 pesos!). We therefore left the car and walked around the town instead. Shame, but in our view, not worth the risk. Perhaps other companies would be more helpful -but definitely worth checking this out in advance.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed relaxing at Riu\u201d", "Author": "KGE", "ReviewID": "UR50507729", "Content": "My review is a total contrast to the previous one, especially since the title was 'Worst Hotel Experience EVER!' I still don't understand what qualified it for that distinction, we must have been at different hotels. Anyways, onto my review. This is the 2nd 'All Inclusive' I've been to, the first was Sandos Playacar Riviera last year (check out my review of that place). We would have gone back to Sandos but found a great deal for Riu so decided to try that, plus we would have access to all other Riu properties in Playcar. We stayed a total of 3 nights. We checked in early (~12pm), which wasn't an issue, they just kept our bags until our room was ready and let us head out to the resort. We also used that time to book our restaurant reservations. Nothing was available the 1st night so we booked for the following 2 nights. A nice thing to note was that no time share agents were in the lobby like there were at Sandos, it was a easy check in process. As was the case with Sandos, the grounds and buildings were in great shape, very clean, well kept, the gardens, lawns and water features all maintained well. The pool area was large, plenty of chairs, as well as in the large palm-shaded beach area. The beach was nice, wide, plenty of room to move around and enjoy the water and sand. There were also hammocks under some of the palm trees, great for an afternoon nap. Beach-side waiters weren't out in force so you didn't always have a drink handy, but i didn't mind the 10-20 meter walk to the bar at the pool to get my own drink! The bar tenders, although very busy at times, were happy and helpful, made drinks as requested and a few seemed to enjoy themselves quite a bit, having fun and kidding around with some of the guests. I never had to wait long for a drink and sometimes got 2 of what i ordered. The crowd was pretty laid back, mainly older european couples, very few kids. This place does not have a 'party' atmosphere, much more relaxed. I found the food to be quite good. Plenty of selection at the buffets, dishes constantly being made, refreshed. I found that the cooks were happy to cook something up for you to your preferences if you liked, e.g eggs to order, toasted sandwiches, pasta dishes, tostadas, queadillas, etc. Lots of salads and fruits. Different things were served during lunch and dinner. I love to eat and always found something I liked that was of good quality, no complaints at all. The restaurants were ok, the Japanese was my least favorite, just not of the same quality as you'd expect from a good Japanese restaurant in the states for example. The mexican restaurant was pretty good, and the margharita they offered as you entered was a nice touch. I just like the casual atmosphere of the buffets, the wider selection and variety. The service was top notch as well. Staff were very helpful and friendly, appreciative of any attempts to speak spanish. Similar experience as I had at Sandos although I'd have to say the food at Riu was a bit better quality. We also got to eat at the other Palace resort, the Mexico, and found it to be pretty good as well. Our rooms were well appointed and comfortable, spotlessly clean. The bed was on the firm side as is usually expected in this part of Mexico for some reason. Included was a well stocked mini bar with beer and soft drinks and water along with a 4-bottle dispenser of various liquors. We ordered room service once and it arrived quickly. The room service menu is somewhat limited, but hard to imagine you'd rely on just room service with the selection of food available during the day at the buffets and restaurants. I can't comments on phone or internet service as I didn't use them, I was on vacation :) I did note that there was internet available in the lobby and also at the sports bar for a fee, as was also the case at Sandos. More affordable internet access is readily available in Playa at many internet cafes, along with callings services. The only negative I can think of was the pretty ordinary gym that they had. Very basic hotel like, not much in the way of weight equipment and limited cardio. Sandos had a very nice gym with hot tub, pool, steam room etc. All in all an enjoyable stay at The Riu Palace Riviera. Great value in a great location.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel Experience EVER!\u201d", "Author": "trevorsmommy3", "ReviewID": "UR50460779", "Content": "Ah, where do I start... from the very beginning this hotel was a nightmare and proceeded to ruin our vacation. 1. All-Inclusive. The room service consists of 5 items (all bad except the nachos). You can only book a reservation at one of the restaurants between 12pm-3pm IN PERSON which means if you have plans during the day or just want to relax by the pool then you have to go to the lobby to make your reservation and hope there's a spot open. We were too lazy/busy doing other things to do this so I don't know if we would have been able to get one if we had. The restaurants seem popular since the buffet which is the only other option is HORRIBLE!! 2. Room Comfort. NOT!!! The A/C unit barely worked and it felt humid and the sheets felt wet the whole time. The bed and TV are not across from each other so if you want to relax in bed and watch TV like most people then you actually have to rearrange the furniture. Housekeeping also sucked since we noticed a pair of red lace thong panties in the closet which did NOT belong to me (see attached photo). GROSS!!! Mattress was uncomfortable. Iron left white paint chips on clothes. Temperature in shower went from scalding to cold quickly. 3. Can't use a calling card from the hotel room phone. We actually had to walk down the street to a noisy shopping area to make calls home or pay $2 a minute. Not convenient at all. There are resorts in Mexico that actually have free calls to the US from your hotel room phone. Definitely going to stay at one of those places next time. 4. Internet. THERE IS NOT AN OPTION TO ACCESS INTERNET FROM YOUR LAPTOP IN YOUR ROOM!!!!!! This is kind of a big deal for us since we both are self-employed and need email for our business. You have to go to the lobby and use the free wireless internet there. ARGHHHHHH! I've been to Mexico before and stayed at the Sun Palace and LOVED it! If this was my only experience I would probably not like Mexico at all. Do not ever book a stay here!

I had stayed at the Riu Santa Fe in Cabo San Lucas a couple years ago, so I knew the Riu would be nice, but the \"palace\" version was definitely worth the extra money. Rooms--We booked through Funjet and upgraded to a garden-view room. The rooms were nice and clean, and the mini-bar was great. We tipped a couple days, but it didn't seem to matter. They still stocked 2 or 3 beers each day. I'm sure you could call and ask for more, but we weren't in the room much. The view of the courtyard was gorgeous, and we could see the pool and a little bit of the ocean. We were close to the courtyard and entertainment, which was loud until 11 or 12 every night, but we stay up late, so it was no problem. Entertainment--The entertainment was actually pretty good. They had a couple dancing shows and one night had some kind of arial acrobatic show outside. The bartender at the bar in the entertainment area is named Quique, and he's great! We sat in the courtyard area and drank and watched the entertainment almost every night. The cocktail waiters and waitresses are great, and we never waited long with an empty glass. Food--Breakfast and lunch buffets were good. The food was comparable to the Riu Santa Fe, but at the palace there is wine with dinner and mimosas with breakfast. We only ate at the dinner buffet once. We ate at 2 of the restaurants, \"Krystal\" and \"Chilis Steakhouse.\" Reservations are a pain, and when we went to make them, Krystal was full; however, my boyfriend found that tipping the reservation lady magically opened up a spot at Krystal. Not sure if the tip was worth it. The tapas at Krystal were good, and the service was excellent, but the food was just okay. We hit up the buffet afterwards. The Steakhouse food was better (my steak was cooked perfectly), and the service was excellent, but I'm not sure it's worth making the reservation. It's a nice change from the buffet, so if you get a reservation, fine, but don't be upset if you can't get one. 24-hour room service is included, but there aren't a lot of options. You can get a piece of chocolate cake at any time though, and that was nice! There are 24-hour snacks somewhere, but we never looked for them. Beach--Beautiful!!!!! Plenty of loungers available. There are also waiters coming around taking drink orders, but they're pretty busy, so it was easier to just go to the pool bar. The sand was nice, and the water was pretty calm. The sand-bag things aren't too unsightly. They really don't look man-made. Pool--Beautiful!...but we're beach people, so didn't spend much time there. Excursions--\"5th avenue\" is a 20-min walk or a $5 taxi ride. Lots of restaurants and shopping (the same stuff they sell everywhere). We ate at La Pallia, and it was okay. It's a cool area to go to one night. In the opposite direction from the hotel is \"Plaza Playacar\" which is only a 10-minute walk. They have some shopping there, an ATM, and a Starbucks. We booked a couple excursions through Funjet/ Lomas Travel rep at hotel. The first was a sunset lobster dinner cruise, and it was AMAZING! The van picked us up and took us to the El Dorado Maroma resort (hope to stay there someday) where we went on a sunset cruise on a catamaran with a bunch of other couples. Champagne, beer, cocktails, and canopes were served on the boat. The music was a weird mix of wedding reception-type music, but we were entertained. The staff were great! Once we got back, they had tables set up on the beach that were partitioned off in these cabana-type things. It was so romantic. The food was great and the service was great!!! I highly recommend this excursion! The other excursion we booked was a tour to Chichin-Itza (mayan ruins). It was a looooong day. We started out at 8 am, and didn't get back until 730pm. We spend half that time on the bus. If you want to see the ruins, I would recommend renting a car and going yourself or booking a private tour. We had many drop offs/ pick ups at other hotels and other unnecessary tour stops (like lunch that wasn't very good). A half-day tour would have been better. I was nervous about the negative reviews, but I was completely satisfied with my stay at the Riu. The front desk was always helpful. Our safe needed to be reset so we could set our own code, and they came up and fixed it right away. The housekeepers don't speak English very well at all, but they will find someone who does if you're trying to communicate with them. I recommened tipping...even just 20 or 50 pesos. While it is all-inclusive, we tipped our bartenders, housekeepers, and waiters, and you can tell it was much-appreciated. Have a great time!

We booked a 6 night stay at the RIU Palace after getting a good travel package. Checked in around 5 PM and was given probably the WORST hotel room. We were next to the service door over looking the tennis court. I knew this would be bad, but we gave it one night's shot. I woke up the next morning hearing lots of noise and my back had a knot from the hard beds. We asked to change rooms and we were given a room much closer to the beach, however it was a smoking room. We decided we'll just take this as the location was great and it didn't smell too bad. The food at the buffet was terrible. I would rather pay to go into town to have something decent. This was one of the worst meals I've ever had. However, after making reservations at the Mexican, Steakhouse, Japanese, and Krystal - we enjoyed eating at the hotel. Our favorites were Krystal, Mexican, Steakhouse, and Japanese in that order. You need to make reservations in advance and I noticed that people were pulling tricks to get multiple reservations. Krystal is really good, I will say that. I did notice that the restaurants we ate at were only half full, yet they were 100% booked. I think this is to keep costs down because the service and quality is 10x better. Lunch we ate at Chili's, and that was hit or miss. Some days they would have pretty good food, the other days it was bleh. The pool and beach was outstanding. We lucked out and had sunshine throughout the trip. As for the staff bringing you drinks, they will if you tip them. However, I gave this one guy $5 and said it was the tip for the day, and he didn't bother coming back after he delivered our first round of drinks. I think the servers stereotype who to look for when serving drinks so they'll get a tip. They did not bring any food down as other people have said in the past. Also, the first day we didn't tip this one server as we thought it was included and he didn't serve us anything the next day. He would walk over to all the tables in the courtyard and bypass us. As you can see, they have their hands reaching out for money. Overall the hotel is pretty nice. The pool needs a real jacuzzi. I would defintely visit Playa del Carmen again but I'm not sure if I would stay at the RIU Palace as if this is their flagship hotel it didn't deliver. The staff was good but if you tip them.

If the review wasn't helpful, please send me a message as to what I could have done to make it better. I value the reviews from this site, and want to give back appropriately. My wife and I had been trying to get to Playa for a few years, we first were snubbed by Hurricane Wilma, then in May by the Swine Flu outbreak. The May situation moved us to Jamaica where we stayed in our first RIU, and we thought enough of it to try this property, the newest RIU in the Riveria Maya for a 5 night stay from Nov 1 - 6, booked through Delta Vacations, with Trafictours for transfers. First, if you are flying in on a high traffic day, expect to spend at least an hour at the airport for immigration and customs. Once through, we walked right past the time share guys who had many victims to choose from, and found our transfer service right past the bar outside the door. We chose a non-stop shared ride transfer, and due to the location of the resort that wasn't a bad idea. It's a good hour and a quarter minimum (we had a very fast driver) so not having to stop a bunch of times gave us more time to spend at the resort and less travel headaches. The resort is in a very secure area, with a gates at all access points to the entire neighborhood. We arrived and were able to check right in, it was about 3:00pm. Check In - At first, we were happy with the way things started. The woman who checked us in did so efficiently and we were on our way to the room, which we were under the impression it would be king bed, garden view (we had requested inside garden view) room. The room ended up overlooking the roof of the resort next door, with two twins pushed together. There was a half empty bottle of soda next to the door, and a previous guests shampoo in the shower. The worst part was the room smelled terribly of disinfectant. So - not happy with the room, we went back and were politely told that was the type we were going to get, but she offered to move us to a different room with the same make-up and view. We asked about moving on the inside, and this became an \"upgrade\" situation. She could move us to a room that we had expected, but it was $50 more per night. She gave us a key to look at it and it was what we had expected so we paid the money and took the room. Honestly, this would not have bothered me but the first couple we met had the same exact situation and she had argued about it and was moved to a similar room for no charge. I felt a bait and switch occurred, and I wasn't the only one. The Room, 2108 - The room we 'upgraded to' was very nice and clean, with no smell to it. The air works fine in the rooms as long as you keep the glass door shut. We didn't feel the bathroom was dark at all, and the mini-bar / fridge was stocked daily with water and diet pepsi, which we used mostly. The liquor dispenser had decent brands of alcohol. The toilet filled slowly, but overall water pressure was good. The shower had some MAJOR hot / cold fluctuations so be careful. We had a partial ocean view, which most rooms had on the east end of the complex on either side. Too far away to hear it. Maid service was good, we tip $5 a day and received towel animals most of the time and also a few extra towels. We had a sub one day and didn't get anything extra. We had turn down service 3 times in five nights, no ryme or reason. As stated elsewhere, the beds are very hard, even with the mattress pad I had trouble sleeping and slept on the pool lounger the last night on top of the mattress. The hall noise is very noticeable. The Food - we didn't care that much for it, and thought both the food quality and service from the RIU in Jamaica was better. We did enjoy the Mexican Buffet and thought the steak at Krystal was the best we experienced. We didn't see any difference in buffet quality / choice from the Clubhotel in Negril to the Palace line. We ate in town one night at the Blue Lobster, which was phenomenal. We did like that sandwiches and fruit were available 24 hours at the Sports Bar. The Bars - We spent a lot of time in the sports bar for football and the world series, and thought Victor gave the best service in the resort so we tipped him very well. The wait staff at the pool and near beach were good, but the bartenders in the pool bar were not friendly, even after a tip. The lobby bar was also nice, and we did like that there were extra wait staff at the Palace as opposed to the Clubhotel. We did not see one show, so I don't know about the other bars. Drinks were mostly poured well. We had Don Julio margaritas which have spoiled all other future margaritas, and the mojitos were also very tasty. The Spa - we had a spa credit and I had a deep tissue and spouse tried aromotherapy. I would not have done the massage without the credit, there are other great massage places in Playa like Veronica's that are less than half the cost. The only thing I didn't like, and another couple we talked with agreed is that they use A LOT of oil for the massage. My wife thought the aromatherapy was okay, but was just a message with scented oils and she expected incense or candles, something more. The Beach - It's a great beach, way better than Negril, and better than most of the other RIU's down the way. The water is a mixed bag - very clear, nothing to look at snorkeling, feels clean, but the sand whales are close to shore so it's not open. You can swim anywhere though so if you walk a short ways down the beach it's more open. We only saw one beach vendor and he didn't bother us. No problem getting loungers at the beach or pool. Some people reserved early, but not enough to be a problem for those of us who follow the rules. Check-out - took about 30 seconds. One thing, if you're leaving on a low traffic day and your transfer service tells you that you need to be at the airport 2.5 hours early, they are wrong! We spent 15 minutes going through the lines at the airport leaving on a Friday morning, and over two hours waiting for our plane. If you can find out what the traffic is like, plan accordingly. We could have eaten breakfast and walked the beach before we left if we had known. I would recommend buying your take home alcohol at the airport in the duty free, it's much less expensive than we saw in town. We had very poor weather for 3 out of our 5 nights, as there was some hurricane influenced rain and thunderstorms that went through. The grounds absorbed the water well, but the building already has some major leaks, one in the south end of the lobby was so bad they had to set-up a gutter system. Even with that humidity our room was fine and our clothes did not smell when we got home. We walked downtown and it took about 20 minutes to get to 5th avenue and Calle 12, which is around the heart of the tourist area. Shopping is less expensive there than on the resort or the mall down the street, but not enough to pay for a cab there and back. SUMMARY Check-in - Okay, but if you don't like your room keep an eye out for the bait and switch. My wife throught the front desk staff were awful, but I thought they were just indifferent. Room - Our final room was great. No real problems other than the hard bed and occasional scalding water in the shower. I would recommend requesting a 2nd floor room, facing the pool area if possible. Never hurts to leave a tip for the housekeeper, but keep in mind it will not always be the same person. Expect to hear people breathing in the hall, sound carries very well. If you're a light sleeper, ear plugs would be a good idea. Food - from poor to excellent. Buffet was good on Mexican night, Krystal was great, the Mexican restaurant food was not as good as the Mexican night buffet food. Lunch and breakfast are okay, but the same choices for the most part each day. Bars - Never had a problem getting a drink! Service at the pool by waitstaff was great, bartenders not so great. Victor in the sports bar was our favorite. Lobby bar was nice, and they have servers out there a well which is better than regular RIU's. Activities - we did nothing but relax, however we did hear that the people that did them enjoyed them. I would have snorkeled on the resort trip, which is 1.5 hours daily at 1:00 but the weather prohibited it, parasailing was $120 for two people, which is way too high. Spa - you would do better to go into town unless you have a spa credit. Beach - very nice beach, clean water, no good snorkeling at the resort, nice walk down to the other RIU's. Check-out - quick and easy. Remember your towel cards. If we go back to Playa, we would consider staying again if we choose to stay at an all inclusive. The location is great, the beach is great and the pool was also the best we saw of the other RIU's. The food and some service issues could improve, but we didn't feel they were deal breakers.

I have stayed at RIU in Cabo (nothing to complain about) and my friend stayed at a RIU in Jamaica (also nothing to complain about). We were looking for a beautiful place to stay that was all-inclusive (we did a lot of research), and had a great beach. The RIU had the best price and was a great location so we booked it. Our arrival - The RIU was absolutely beautiful. We had no problems checking in other than our room wasn't ready for a 1/2hr (not a big deal at all). The room - The room was very clean and was true to the pictures. It was stocked and cleaned everyday. The beds were turned down at night. We had a courtyard view and I think it was a great location, we overlooked beautiful gardens, fountains, and you could see the beach from our room. Be careful about getting a room close to the pool cause it can be loud down there. This hotel was being cleaned everyday by tons of staff, I mean every inch of it. Reviewers that have complained about musty mildew smell, it's ridiculous! The hotel is right on the beach and it's hot- you're going to have some smell but it was nothing to complain about. If you have issues with this then I recommend not staying at hotel on the beach. The food - The food was great. We ate every meal either at the buffet or the restaurants. We were full and happy! If you are looking for 5 star dining every meal and everyday, this isn't the place for you. We are not picky eaters. There was always good food and all kinds of options. I would recommend going out a night or two for a great seafood dinner! The beach - gorgeous, well-kept, and always had an area with a lounge chair. I know I've read complaints about the waiters not getting out drinks when reviewers wanted them. We didn't care, if we didn't see a server we just walked up to the bar and got drinks. Not a big deal. A great thing was there were no vendors trying to selling you crap! Overall - it was a beautiful hotel with great service. We enjoyed every minute of it.

My husband and I had stayed there beofre and love the smaller, more intimate atmosphere. This time we travelled with my sister and her husband. The rooms there were a little on the warm side, and my sister did not like the idea of no bathtub. So we switched to the Palace. The Palace is indeed a very nice hotel. It is large, but laid out well. You do not have to walk forever to get from one area to another. The junior suites are nicely furnished, with double sinks in the bathroom. They are exceptionally clean, as is the entire resort. The large pool and infinity pool are adjacent, and very clean. While we were there, the pools were too cold to go into for a couple of days, but were nice. The buffet food is good, with a wide array of choices. We tried all the al a carte restaurants, and they were fairly good. I think we enjoyed the buffet food more, but the atmosphere is very nice in the specialty restaurants. Service there is overall good. The only disappointment was in the entertainment area. We have stayed at RIUs before, but first time at a RIU Palace. I honestly think the lesser RIU properties are more fun. At the Palace, the daytime activities were minimal. Two or three days, they didn't even bother to get a volleyball game going as was scheduled. The night time entertainment was hit or miss, but this is generally the case anywhere you go. A couple of the shows were very entertaining. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a relaxing stay in a very nice resort. But if you enjoy more poolside activities, I would recommend the RIU Playacar or the RIU Tequila.", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort\u201d", "Author": "gat0", "ReviewID": "UR48530082", "Content": "We went to this resort from the 16 of October to the 30 of October for a 2 week stay at this resort and all i can say this place is amazing. Check-in Took 10 minutes to get my room and got our bags 5 minutes later . Room verry clean Fridge filled with some soft drinks and some nice cold beer and thats were we had our first cerveza but this fridge was noisy they came twice to repair it but the problem was never solved but hey it had something cold to drink so we kept the darn thing even if we had a headache the next morning as this thing was loud . Buffet know this place had some great food allways found something good to eat and for a buffet it was the best one i ever had waiters and cooks do a great job at this place and never had any problem with none of them and also at the buffet you have some good choices of wine as most buffets will give you the cheap wine . A la Carte Restaurants they have 5 of them but we only went to 2 of them as the others we did not care much for them so here is the 2 we went too as for reservation well its open from 12 to 3 so go after 1 pm and you will ok that way no waiting in line . Krystal this one had some great food we went there 4 times and this place was our favor never had one plate that i did not enjoy and also they had some great wine as my favor was a white wine from California and another thing the waiters working at this place funny and professional which you can see they love there job . Japanese this one was a surprise as the food was also pretty good never expected to be this good . Pool Bar i never had any problem with them to get my drinks as i waited my turn and got served like all others never took long to get my drinks and if your at the pool or resting in your chair well there is waiters going around taking your order and our favourite was Charly great kid that remembers your drink and it does not take long for Charly to get you one as he runs around the pool all day . Animation what can i say i met this great guy Joshua who use to play pool volleyball with us and he use to make everybody laugh as he is a cheater yes cheater count your points or Joshua will count for you and if you play against him well to bad you will never win ......as he says its Mexico and you go by his rules and also had an amazing time playing pool volleyball with our Canadian and americans and European friends which we had a blast as people only wanted to have fun and we sure did that . Habana bar or lobby bar Know this is the best one there and ....Islas.... the barman what a gentleman allways trying to please his customers and he makes the best drinks at the resort as we allways had our drink with him before going to dinner thank you Islas for the greast drinks and Cappuccino . Islas also works around the pool during the day as you see him with his small buggy going around making drinks and they are darn good. Beach this was not bad but not great either and the sand bags lets just say its not pretty when looking at them . I was reading some reviews were people were saying that staff were not friendly lets just say i never saw one person there that when i needid help did not help us these people would do anything to make you happy so maybe we did not go to the same resort . People at this resort are what you call verry friendly and im sure most people that went there know what im talking about and for those that want to go there go you wont regret goint to this place Would i go back there if i could i would go back tomorrow as they made us feel right at home and we did not get enough of our great vacation and only have one thing to say .

Two rain showers, each of less than 5 minutes duration during the 5 days. Otherwise hot and sunny with refreshing breezes off the sea. Vendors in town seemed more aggressive than previous trips. Probably a sign of the economy, and a quieter time of year. RPRM - Main buffet continues to serve excellent food. Champagne and orange juice at breakfast helps get the day off to a good start. Plenty of choice at the two evening buffets we attended. Also ate at the Mexican, Krystal and Japanese. Wonderful food and attentive service. No problem getting drink service on the beach.

We stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico last year, our only complaint was how they have you reserve the specialty restaurants each day ( get to the theater by 8 or 8:30 am, hopefully, you will get the number that corresponds to your actual arrival there when the 'number person' shows up, then wait till your number is called, and finally, book your choice, if it's available, and mind you, you had to do this every day if you wanted to eat at a specialty restaurant!!!!) And the pool area at the Mexico doesn't compare to the Riviera Maya.... The Riviera Maya lets you book for 3 days at a time, and the time to do this is 12 noon to 3 pm, so much better than the Mexico, we thought! I was intruiged reading some of the complaints that others have had, one person said that the drinks were served in small glasses!!! So get another one, or order 2 at a time!!! One minor complaint I have (along with the usual annoyance of many toweled covered chaise lounges at the pool and their owners are nowhere to be seen, and I'm talking hours!!!) about the Riviera Maya is that because the hallways are tiled, any noise or voices in the hall transmit quite loudly into a room....for us this meant that our afternoon naps weren't exactly ideal....also, our room overlooked 'The Plaza' area...so when we were in our room in the evening, we could hear the band playing and the music of the shows extremely well, it was actually loud...keep this in mind if you like to retire earlier than 11pm (shows begin at 9:45 pm) But we loved sitting outside in The Plaza area in the evening, listening to the Riu and other bands...we didn't care for the shows, too spoiled by Vegas-like productions, I think!

We were there for our anniversary w/ my dad and my brother, after reading the reviews of how they did special things for other guest I guess I expected the same, but nothing, no wishes, no flowers, no upgrade. Oh well no big deal. The room was ok, no problems. I did smell that smell, but it wasn't that bad until I got home, I could still smell it on my stuff, what can you do, it's humid there. After visiting the other Riu resorts I couldn't figure out why I spent so much more to stay here than the other places, they seemed to have the same alcohol and food but with better and more friendlier service at the bars. If I was to return I would stay at one of the other resorts for less money. The bars at the resort were ok, the service was pretty bad, the bartenders were not that friendly especially in the lobby, the female one was the worst. I saw someone ask them to make them a special drink and the bartender seemed really annoyed. Fito was the only server that was working hard and friendly. Also they only have dos X amber and regular, no other beer at any bars. The steakhouse was my least favorite of the reservation rest. The lobster was small and not that good (overcooked) and the service was REALLY bad! My favorite was Krystal (get the filet and the lobster ravioli w/ shrimp), then the Brazialian (there's lot's of meat) then the Japanese. Breakfast was really good at don manuelo, was so/so at chili's. Lunch seemed ok, same thing everyday. Here are some tips if you are going, bring a big insulated cup, if you want a taxi to the other resorts, only pay $3, they will ask for $5 but will do it for 3, don't swim behind the sand whales, it is really dangerous (someone almost drowned when we were there), tip, cause I think they expect it, and see the Michael Jackson show and the Mariachi's . If you are a light sleeper like myself, bring earplugs, everything echoes in the halls, had a hard time getting a full nights sleep.

This was our 4th Riu hotel but the first for my daughter & her partner & by far the best. On arrival we were met by a lovely tasting fruit punch & a very friendly quick check in. Our rooms were junior suites next door to each other with very comfortable beds. Our luggage arrived at our room within 5 minutes & within 15 minutes a plate of chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of champagne & a birthday card were delivered to my daughters room as her boyfriend was celebrating his 30th birthday four days later. We had emailed in advance informing them of this occasion & if they could arrange a birthday cake for us but this was a very pleasant surprise. On his actual birthday (4th Oct) we had booked the Mexican restaurant & 2 days prior we asked again if there was a possibility of a cake. When we arrived at the Mexican they had decorated a table in rose petals & metallic 30 confetti, we were given champagne & at the end of the meal they brought out a beautifully decorated cake complete with candles & all the waiters then sang happy birthday. We were so pleased. How wonderful was that. I can only reiterate all the wonderful reviews that have been made. The alcohol was plentiful, never watered down (I am aware this practice does happen at some hotels) The service was second to none sometimes drinks arrived before we had even finished the first. The quality of wine varied from restaurant to bar I personally preferred the chardonnay in the lobby bar. My husband enjoyed the Don Pedro brandy, my daughter adored all the cocktails & her partner well he just enjoyed alcohol in general. Waiter service on the beach was brilliant & I would like to say a very big thanks to Fito & Jose for keeping us all well hydrated. The food let the hotel down a bit for me, although always a big array of different foods, on a number of occasion\u2019s food was either raw or overcooked. One morning when I cut into my omelette raw egg mixture poured out, Prompting me to always ask for it well done after that. Another time the chicken was still raw in the middle & my fish was so over cooked it could not be cut with the knife. I would advise everyone to watch everything they put on their plate. We always did & avoided any upset stomachs. One fish I absolutely loved was Grouper this really is a must try & they always cooked this perfectly. We tried all the restaurants & enjoyed them all. The Brazilian was a different eating experience were meat & poultry is brought out in different stages on large skewers & they slice it in front of you directly on to your plates. Having been to Brazil we found it quite authentic but a bit long-winded. My least favourite was the Japanese there was nothing at all wrong with it its just that im not a lover of sushi but my husband loved it so really is personnel preference. The air con in the buffet was quite powerful & a welcome relief most days, but it did tend to make the food cool down on your plate very quickly. The entertainment finished early & I enjoyed the sax player but always managed to not see his entire act due to us still being in the restaurants (as we preferred the later sitting) Once 11pm came that was it for the night. All the bars shut at 12 except the sports bar, as this was the 24-hour bar. I didn\u2019t like this bar as the seating was all bar stools & I didn\u2019t find it very relaxing there. My daughter preferred this bar, as it was the only indoor area that you could smoke. Stalls would set up in the courtyard around the hotel but we found them very expensive. We bought a doll in Playa del Carmen for $8 & the same doll on the stalls were $15 & they wouldn\u2019t go lower. My advice is to visit PDC & get the same things cheaper. The stallholders are quite persistent & get on your nerves after a while. The walk into PDC took approx 15 minutes or 50 pesos in a taxi (2.50GBP) it is well worth a visit or two as it has lots of shops bars & restaurants. Coco Bongos has opened there so is easier to visit than Cancun which is well over 1 hour away in a taxi. There are some shops in Playacar if you turn left outside the hotel & walk for about 5 minutes you will come to them, they are worth a look round. But PDC I thought was still cheaper. On the walk to Playacar we called in at Riu Playacar & stopped by the pool for a drink but we found the bar tender really rude & he demanded to see all 4 wrist bands before he would serve us, even though they were clearly on show. He did not seem happy that we were from the palace, this I found odd because as palace guests we were supposed to be able to use all Riu\u2019s. Im sure this is not the typical greeting I just think he had his awkward head on that day. Other Riu guests were using the facilities of our hotel even though we were told none palace guests couldn\u2019t. Often different colour wristbands were in the hotel & this went unchallenged. The air con in all public areas is fantastic & despite the heat outside made you feel so much more comfortable. This hotel ranks with some of the best we have stayed in for comfort service & quality. We all felt very spoilt & didn\u2019t want to come home.

My only complaint is that the first night that we were there, we discovered that the room hadn't been cleaned properly from its previous inhabitants. ALL of the bedding was stinky, like bad B.O. + mildew stinky. Reception brought us new stuff, but as their housekeeping staff was off for the night, we had to make up the bed ourselves (which I was happy to do if it meant getting to sleep on non-stinky bedding). Some of the soap/toiletry items hadn't been replaced from the previous guests as well. After that one yucky night, every night thereafter, the room was in good order: clean, not stinky, and air conditioned. The bed was neither either good or bad. You might want to consider bringing your own pillows as theirs seem old and imbued with the odor of the past however many previous guests---not even kidding.

The other areas of the hotel (e.g., restaurants) are generally nicer-looking than the lobby \u2022The beach/location: The beach is pretty nice except for the fake sandbar that stands in the way of swimming out just a little bit further than I'd have liked to. The Hotel is near Xcaret, Xplor, & Tulum. \u2022The food: Pretty good, but not something to rave about. I recommend eating at Don Manolo's rather than the reservation-in-advance restaurants. The ones that require reservations have very small portion sizes to already mediocre food. At Don Manolo's you get more for your buck, not to mention a lot more variety than the other restaurants. Roomservice menu has VERY few items available. The food in the sports bar is flat out disgusting, period. \u2022The staff: Overall, very nice.

The hotel and grounds were generally clean, except for the restrooms off the lobby which were disgusting and smelling of a port-o-potty in high-summer.

The only dissappointment was there was not a waiter in sight to bring drinks the entire week we were there. SERVICE: Quite dissappointing. We tip, and well, but the service was consistantly bad from the front desk to the towel person. The drinks are small and lacking of alcohol. The quality of service did not improve regardless of 20% tips. The people not tipping were treated as poorly was we were so we finally gave up toward the end of our trip. (The bartenders at the swimup bar were the worst). FOOD: From simply ok to dismal. If food is important to you, you should consider staying elsewhere. The specialty restaurants would not worth the (annoying) wait in line except you would go crazy if you had to eat in the buffet every night. (Which did not change their offerings the entire week were were there). The Japanese was ok. The sushi was surprisingly good. The mexican place was also ok. The steakhouse was a joke. It was our 6th anniversary so I was hoping it would be special. Alas, after an hour wait to eat, the lobster tail was tiny and burned to such a crisp it was inedible. The stonecrab claws were still partially frozen and also inedible. My steak was decent, but I was so turned off by the poor service and food that I could not enjoy it. Even though my husband told the head waiter about our celebration, nothing was one to make our evening special. That was our last night there and it was the nail in the coffin for us. In all the hotel is nice if you can get past the \" Ladies of Dallas meets the Caribbean\" decor. The beach is fantastic! Our Anniversary week was not ruined by the bad food, service, and drinks, because we are generally upbeat people, however we were consistantly dissappointed. If we got a screaming deal we would return with drastically lowered expectations.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent all-inclusive\u201d", "Author": "chicagoTRVLR", "ReviewID": "UR47650374", "Content": "I stayed at the RPRM with 2 friends from 10/14-10/18/09 and had a wonderful time. We recently visited the Riu Palace in Cabo and the RPRM was just as nice. I would encourage people to use private or non-stop transportation to the resort to maximize your pool side time on the first day as the drive from the airport is almost 1 hour. We had a bit of trouble initially in securing 2 beds instead of a king for our room, but after some discussion with the front desk personnel we were placed in an ocean view room. The pool, pool side service, and swim up bar were excellent. The \u201cwhales\u201d were everywhere on the shore line, but they encourage plenty of fish which you could see when swimming in the ocean. During low tide you can walk the beach to both ends of Playacar. You can easily walk to 5th avenue in Playa Del Carmen and see the sights without taking a taxi. The buffets at our resort and the RP Mexico (sister resort) were excellent and had plenty of options for the pickiest eaters. We visited the Chilis steakhouse and the Agave Mexican restaurant at this Riu Palace and they were good. As on previous posts, there was a wet/moldy smell that got pretty strong toward the end of our stay emanating from our bathroom. Since we did not spend a lot of time in the room, it wasn\u2019t too bothersome. Our room was cleaned daily and if the mini bar did not have enough Pepsi Light for us, we just called down to room service for a refill. On the second day of our trip, one of the Animacion staff offered a kitchen tour. We were treated to an inside look at the operations of the main RPRM kitchen which was very well run and exceedingly clean.

It has typical Riu Palace type standards, in that it was very clean, great variety of food but what was most impressive was the friendliness of the staff, nothing was too much trouble and from the Receptionist down to the Gardeners and everybody in between you couldn't get past them without hearing the word Ola!. Okay it;s a great hotel and we would go again, but whilst the animation team do a super job, the evening entertainment (with the odd exception of Kenny Gee )is very similar to what we've seen at all the Palace hotels; for e.g. The Michael Jackson show (which the Americans love ) we've seen at a Palace hotels in Mexico over the last 3 years and this wears a bit thin after a while. Restaurants: The Don Manola is the main Buffet restaurant and it's great , but if you fancy a special meal there is a choice of Theme restaurants to try.Our particular favourite was \"Krystal\" although we also tried the Japanese which we found interesting but rather rushed,there are another 3 which we heard varying reports of but it's down to personal choice, but talk to people that have tried them to get a feel for them. For lunch time you have to go th Chillis which is right by the main pool and there is a waitress there called Maury who is really attentive without being intrusive and so efficient.

The service was the absolute best, the staff was so friendly, the room was clean. I had no complaints. The one thing I must say is the hallways can get a little loud with the doors slamming and such but its not too bad, its okay it didnt happen too often. As for the restaurants, I really enjoyed the Japanese. I do not like sushi or seafood but they still had the option of the chicken teriyaki which was amazing. The buffet food was always good, the breakfasts were even better. There is a 24 hour \"snack bar\" as they call it but its in the sports bar and its just a fridge full of food and there is a microwave to help yourself. The pool was amazing, especially the relaxing one that overflowed into the main pool. If anyone does visit this resort you will not have any regrets and please do visit Victor in the sports bar, he is the best bartender there and Tono at the pool bar. The beach was excellent, although as you probably know they have man made sand bags but they wernt an inconvienence for me because i could barely touch the ground after them.

The hotel was very fancy, decorated very well, clean, lots of fresh flowers, very impressive, the pool was perfect- huge and not too crowded, great bars! The beach is amazing- plenty of chairs, and huge area under the palm trees with hammocks and plenty of chairs. The upper part of the pool gives you a great ocean view, and its not a long walk to the water at all. I suggest- bring (or buy at the gift shop) a large insulated cup for drinks, order the mango daiquiri (its the best), espresso martinis, making the breakfast buffet everyday, shots from the best bartender ever at the sports bar, and seeing all the shows. Also 5th ave downtown is a quick taxi ride $5 or decent walk, for great shopping. Good mix of people, at least half european, mostly couples, few young kids, mostly young people. We walked down to the other rui resorts, they are about 4 hotels down on the beach- not next door, the other palace (rui palace mexico) was the only one that seemed even remotely similar in terms of how nice the pool/beach was- but honestly its pool was not nice at all- its a wierd flower shape, with the bar in the middle, not big and open like ours, plus the beach was far from the hotel and pool. I would have been VERY dissapointed if I had stayed there honesltly.

We would recommend this hotel to anyone and don't understand any of the negative comments you might have read on other reviews. This place is first-class, especially for the price range, and were thrilled that it exceeded our expectations in every way. Following is a summary of some of the areas that we feel may be important to other people considering a stay here. Beach and Pool - The pool was beautiful and never too crowded. We loved the infinity pool that was separate from the main pool. It was always quieter than the main pool but close enough to the pool bar to get a drink whenever we got thirsty. The beach and ocean were MUCH better, however, and we spent the majority of our time there. The sand was white, the water was clean, clear, and calm. We didn't even mind the sand whales, which are there to protect the beach from erosion, because we enjoyed snorkeling around them and watching the fish that hang out there. The lounge chairs were plentiful and a couple large stands of palm trees provided plenty of shade. Room, Grounds & Facilities - The hotel is gorgeous and MASSIVE in scale. When we first walked into the lobby we felt like we were in a fine European/Spanish (as in Spain) hotel on steroids. We were forunate enough to get a great room at the end of the hotel nearest the beach and pool (we requested an upgrade and/or a location near the beach and the front desk was kind enough to do so at no charge), and this was the perfect location for us. If you'd rather be close to the lobby and specialty restaurants, you might want to request this because it's a long haul from one end of the hotel to the other. :-) Everything was in excellent condition - our room, the grounds, and the hotel in general. The grounds and maintenance staff work their tails off to keep the hotel in such good condition. Everything was also immaculately clean thanks to an excellent maid staff who were constantly present throughout the hotel. Service - The staff at the hotel is second to none. We had EXCELLENT service everywhere we went, but especially in the specialty restaurants. Someone was always asking if we needed anything, bringing us drinks, pulling out our chairs for us, and generally spoiling us rotten. Food/Restauants - The food here is the best we've had at any hotel. The buffets (Don Manolo for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and Chili's for lunch) were excellent and had a great variety of food to please even the pickiest eater. We also ate at several of the specialty restaurants (but would have been okay with eating at the buffet only since there were different themes each night). Chili's turns into the steakhouse for dinner and we ate here our first night. The food was good but the dessert presentation of their baked Alaska is something you shouldn't miss! We also ate at Krystal, the fusion restaurant, where the staff bent over backwards for us (thank you Rosario!) and gave us special attention because it was our anniversary. We had a beautiful table decorated with rose petals, candles and our own bottle of wine. The sea bass and fillet were both excellent and made for a very memorable dinner. We were less impressed with Agave, the Mexican restaurant, but the food was still good and offered a nice salad and appetizer bar. Lastly, we ate at Botafogo, the Brazilian restaurant. This place is a carnivore's dream come true, as the servers came by at least 6 times with skewers of various grilled meats sliced at the table for you to sample. Vegetarians wouldn't starve here, though, because they did have a salad bar. Safety - We were a little concerned with safety before arriving at the hotel, but our concerns soon disappeared before we even got to the hotel. The hotel is located in a secure area where traffic is monitored like a private community. We also saw security personnel at the beach and never felt worried about leaving our beach bag and camera while swimming in the ocean. The bottom line - Riu Palace Riviera Maya is a wonderful place to stay for a relaxing vacation. If you're considering staying here - DO IT! Chances are you'll have the vacation experience of your dreams, like we did.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland Texas", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d", "Author": "annie8849", "ReviewID": "UR46694436", "Content": "This has got to be the best Rui hotel.

The specialty restaurants are good, especially the steak house and Brazilian steak house. Not so good comments: 1. The fact that you can only make so many dinner reservations at a particular time is irritating. 2. There is no beach drink service anymore, so it is advised to take a large insulated cup with you to fill up before heading to the beach. That will keep you from making many trips to the bar for refills. 3. The shop keepers in town are desperate for money since tourism is so down this year.

We like to stay in nice places during the off-season to get a good bargain. The nicest hotel I've ever stayed in is Mandalay Bay in Vegas, 6 years ago, when it was fairly new. We stayed at Riu PRM from Oct 1-5, 2009, during a long weekend getaway. Overall experience: Inconsistent - we had a great time, but this was not a luxury vacation by any stretch. There are lots of staff working hard to keep things clean, and they are all polite, but services were very inconsistent. Check-in: You're given a small, no frills glass of an orange-y fruit drink by someone behind the check in counter, definitely not fancy or even especially welcoming. The front desk rep helping us also answered the phone each time it rang, which was 5-7 times while we were there, so it took about 10 or so minutes for us to check in. She also went into the back room a couple of times, leaving us just standing there. When she gave us our room key, we walked over to the bellman who had haphazardly tossed our bags onto a cart with a few other bags and was chatting with other bellman - not exactly top-notch welcoming service. The room: Nice, big, clean, smelly. We had room # 2039, a junior suite near the beach. The room was clean, but showed obvious wear, especially the bathroom, which is probably why they keep it a little dark in there. The room was super humid, even with the a/c on the entire time. This lead to a strange, slightly moldly smell. I brought a Plug-In, but it had no effect on the odor. It wasn't awful, but that, plus the humidity factor, made the room uncomfortable for anything other than for the absolute basics. We had turn-down service 1 of 4 nights, and towel animals 3 of 4, even though we tipped the maid each day. The linens were old and worn - scratchy, nubbly, and had stains. Definitely bring your own toiletries - they only have a hair & body combo wash along with a few other marginal Italian toiletry items. Oh, and forget romance. There's nothing romantic about the room. Neither the tv nor the radio have any music stations (or an IPod dock), and the smell is not so conducive to romance either. The food: It's as good as I've ever had at a buffet, but it's still a buffet! And it's your only option for breakfast and lunch (except for a very lame room service menu). Fortunately, we were able to skip the buffet for dinner and eat at the \"gourmet\" restaurants for each dinner. We didn't have reservations the first 2 nights, but we went to the restaurants to see if there any no-shows. Each night there were many empty tables, so if you're willing to wait for about 15 minutes after each seating, you'll probably get lucky, at least during slow season. None of the restaurants were great (I live in Houston and we have many WONDERFUL restaurants), but it beat more buffet eating. Service was inconsistent, overkill in one area/place, non-existent in another. One big plus - no upset tummies the entire stay. The activities: We only did what was included (nonmotorized sports) - they are open from 9-4:30 each day, but you'll need to sign a waiver near the ping-pong table before you can check out a boogie board, catamaran, kayak, etc. The guys are great and helpful some days, not so much on the others. The beach service: Inconsistent! We had great beach service the first day we were there (Friday). It waned a bit the following day, and had completely dissappeared by the next (Sunday), even though the guests in the pool were being served. They serve drinks outside in tiny, juice-sized cups, but will use yours if you bring your own keep-cool cup. They will use thier premium liquor if you request, but when they run out for the day, it's gone. Sometimes you get a pineapple slice, sometimes a lime, sometimes nothing. Very inconsistent. The beach/pool bar closes promptly at 6 with no apologies. The pool: It's big and has a swim up bar. But they allow kids/babies to swim naked and people to eat nachos at the swim up bar. Gross. Also, the pool is pretty warm except for late in the day. The pool and jacuzzi closes promptly at 8 each day! There was definitely an older crowd here (read: 50+). It was quiet, laid back, easy going. There were only a few kids, a few singles, a few large groups, and a few gay couples. A little boring actually, but that's just what we wanted on this trip! We probably wouldn't stay here again, or suggest it to friends - for a couple hundred dollars more, I would try something more upscale next time.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cIt was fun....\u201d", "Author": "carm424", "ReviewID": "UR46306799", "Content": ", but I would stay at a different hotel next time.

The first night they did not have the connecting rooms, but we were moved the next morning. The crib was waiting in the room. We asked for extra water bottles for the babies food, they made sure our refrigerator was stocked every day. The only complaint, as mentioned in others, the door slamming. It really did not bother us in the morning because the baby was up at 6. She stayed on her East Coast time schedule. Beware travelers from the US on the East Coast. Be prepared to have to put them down at the same time you do at home, in just a week, it is hard to change habits.

I thought the room was very nice, we were upgraded to a jucuzzi suite which we only discovered upon seeing our room and took that as a good sign. I loved the food at Don Manalo which is where the dinner buffet is nightly and breakfast. They had some world class chefs there and while there was some of the same each night they also had different themes. We never tried the specialty restaurants as we dont like to be tied down to a seating time. The resort looked to be maybe half full, plenty of space on the beach and the service there was excellent. We never had to get up for a drink they even brought fruit and yogurt cups and pizza was brought out in the afternoon. They somehow reclaimed their beach as a short walk either way showed us that other places we had stayed at had hardly any at all. The only part that needs improvement was the sportsbar but we were only there to play pool during a short rain storm. I thought the pool tables shouldn't require money to play!

We have been delighted with every trip to a Riu-especially the Palaces, we believe they are worth the little extra money over the regular Riu's and still do. Upon Check In we were given a welcome cocktail at the desk and were quickly given perfect rooms with beautiful courtyard views-we had room 1107 on the second floor. We had the king sized beds we had requested and my husband and I had chocolate dipped strawberries and a wonderful bottle of champagne in our refrigerator-I assume because we are Riu Class members who have had several trips to Riu's? I don't know, but it was a wonderful surprise. We had very little problems making reservations for the \"ala carte\" restaurants, and we LOVED the food. Our favorites were the Mexican, Brazillian and the Steak House. The buffet was always overflowing with wonderful food-I've got to say that anyone who cannot find wonderful food at this resort is WAY picky. The deserts here were amazing, great cheesecake, wonderful ice cream, the Brazillian restaurant had desert crepes! I am on a diet after coming home-but it was worth every moment-what are vacations for?? The breakfast and lunch buffet's were wonderful too! We really enjoyed sitting in the lounge drinking all kinds of martini's before dinner every night. The staff was amazing. The front desk people were so welcoming and helpful for ANYTHING we needed, the best of any Riu we've ever stayed at. Our favorites around the place were Maury in the breakfast and lunch buffet areas-she waved us in every day-she REMEMBERED after our first day or two what we wanted to drink (coffee and Mimosa's at breakfast were always there for us!) and she never let our cups/glasses be empty. Wonderful Ivan in the evening at the shows and in the lounge was a BLAST-he delighted in teaching us new spanish words-we loved the peanuts they brought out and whenever Ivan saw us, he would race peanuts to our table-these people are amazing. TIP these people, they work SO HARD. A dollar or two goes a long way-and they sure apprieciate it! I've never seen harder working people than those at these resorts in Mexico. We never wanted for ANYTHING! We enjoyed many shows and the little band that plays at the RPRM. We were told that the Entertainment staff would take guests to clubs in Playa if asked, well-we approached Rudy about going to Coco Bongo's and with us we figured out the best night. Rudy, Pepe and David took a small group from our hotel, got us the BEST seats in the house and Rudy stayed with us all evening (night and into the wee hours of the next AM) making sure we got drinks and were happy-AMAZING! All for the $50.00 fee to get into Coco Bongo's-of course we gave Rudy a nice tip at the end of the evening-WOW it was amazing.

This place has it's pros and cons like any other resort. The top 3 pros were 1. The service we received from the following 4 people: Jose, our waiter by the ocean and poolside, Victor in the Sport Bar, Pedro, the hotel watersports activity director, and Santos, who we seemed to run into in a different location everyday was a class act. The 4 of them made our vacation extra special. 2. Views from the room (we had a courtyard view room) and the music in the evening from the balcony 3. The food was abundant, delicious, fresh. We enjoyed the Mexican restaurant, and the Steak House Chili's. The 3 top cons: 1. Need more elevators and restrooms. Stairs are a killer in the heat if you are on the second floor. The only elevator is by the lobby. It was a pain if you were in the Sport Bar or the main dining room and had to use the restroom. You had a long trek. 2. Bugs are bad!!!! Need to spray or light bug candles or something. I realize it's the jungle but a little bug spray would go a log way around the pool area. While eating our steak dinner, we felt more like the meal, the mosquitos were terrible. 3. Minibar was not stocked. Terrible minibar service even after tipping. Front desk staff were rude too. All other service was very excellent. This resort is spread out so there is a lot of walking involved. I would recommend requesting a room near the spot you plan on spending most of your time. If you are a pool/beach person, you'll want to ask to be placed on that end of the resort. It is very hot so I would also recommend asking for morning sun. All of the rooms allow smoking on the balcony only which is good. There is a laptop size electronic safe in the room. The beach is very swimmable. No reason to worry about swimming in the ocean here. It's clear, warm and shallow. If you plan to do any activities like wave runners, parasail, snorkel, etc..., talk to Pedro. He will probably find you but if not, he is down on the upper beach where you get the kayaks, hobicats, etc...He works for Riu, not like one of the vedors on the beach. His prices are great! Jose, our waiter by the ocean, was a hard working, friendly, very fun loving, person. He was there early in the morning and went home after dark every night and always had a smile on his face. He was a great waiter, he always remembered what we were drinking. Fito was a good waiter as well. Victor, the bartender in the Sport Bar was fun and always kept the crowd going. He has a gift for this. He makes awesome drinks too! The food was great for the most part. We did not like the Brazilian. We found this restuarant to be daunting, dark, and unfriendly. The \"bosses\" standing around were very intimidating. I know they were watching the employees slicing the meat, but it felt like we were being watched. I hated it and the food wasn't that great for as long as we had to wait. The soup was my favorite here. It was very good. We didn't even stay for desert. The Mexican (Agave) and Steakhouse were good. The service here was better as well. Daniel made our Mayan Coffee at Agave and he did an excellent job. He was a very good waiter. He made a piont of coming up to us at the resort wherever he was working that day to say hello. The presentation of the Baked Alaska in the Steakhouse was pretty impressive too. I would also like to say a little something about the women that went topless. There were many. Maybe it's because I am born and raised in the midwest USA (thank God) but with little children/teenagers running around, and knowing the Hispanic culture like I do, I found it disturbing, tactless, and disrespectful. There are other resorts that cater to that sort of thing. The Sax player in the courtyard during the Circus show was fantastic! We danced on our balcony. We really enjoyed our stay here. It was just all the walking that we were not expecting. We came home wore out instead of rested. Thank you Riu.

I was responsible for bringing a group of a bit more then 75 people with me as well. One of the bridesmaids in the wedding also followed our footsteps since we praised Riu's services, and she too just recently had her wedding on May 29th, 2009 at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. There were about 25 people who turned out to this wedding, most of which attended mine the prior year. In total, I have brought this chain a little more than 100 people, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue, within the past year alone. Unfortunately, our last trip was not one to remember. From the start, the front desk clerk, Luis, was extremely rude. He would constantly sigh and roll his eyes when asked for assistance, and would make the guests feel like they were idiots. The Bride and Groom also had a nonfunctioning air conditioner for days. Even on their wedding day, they did not have a/c and the Bride had to get ready in my room (2101). Every time Luis was asked to have their a/c fixed, he came up with excuses. He also refused to help them change rooms. This was just the beginning. There are many Riu Resorts nearby, and the \"Palace\" ones should have free access to the other's restuarants, clubs, etc. We come to find out all other resorts were shut down due to the swine flu. We spoke with other couples that were to be staying at the other Riu Resorts for a wedding, and were told their hotels were changed, after they arrived. I feel bad for the bride and groom. My main issue is the staff you employ at this resort. The security on the resort is horrible, and not helpful. The staff at the SPA went into my locker while I was getting a message, and stole money from my wallet. Before heading to the SPA for my 7:00PM appointment, I took exactly $100 cash with me, all in twenty dollar bills. I was told to arrive at the SPA about 30 minutes before, so I could relax in the hot-tub before hand. When I arrived, I was asked if I would be paying cash or credit. I said cash, and then asked what the total was. As I counted out the $100 in front of the receptionist, she replied the total was $106. I then said I would have to pay with my credit card, and I put the cash back into my wallet. I was then handed a robe, towel and locker key, and was told to go change and leave my belongings in the locker (13A). I did so. After my massage, I got dressed and returned to the SPA lobby. I then reached into my wallet and took a $20 bill out to tip my masseuse\u2026not knowing I had already been robbed while getting a massage. I returned to my room to shower and change, and get ready for our dinner reservations. After dinner, I took out my wallet to leave a tip (even though this place is all-inclusive I still tip the staff well as they work very hard), and this is when I noticed I was missing two $20 bills. I only had $40 left in my wallet. I retraced my every step over and over again, and I never once used any of the 100 dollars, besides the $20 I gave the masseuse. After being in shock that hotel staff not only stole from me, but had access to my locker at the SPA, I became extremely angry. I called to the front desk and explained my frustration, and was told to fill out a report. The person at the desk at this time was Raul Valdez. He said there was no security on staff at that time, and that I would have to speak with the person who handles the \u201cinternal investigations\u201d, Marcos, but Marcos would not be in until the following day. I told Raul I was leaving the next morning, so this would not work. He said to fill out the form (see attachment), and someone would get back in touch with me. I still to this day have not received a call or email from any Riu staff member. I even had Raul sign that he received the report on the copy I had him make for me (bottom right corner of attachment). After no response for months, I called Riu to speak with management. I got the run around the whole time. I then asked for an email address for management so I could make a complaint which I sent on June 29, 2009, only to receive an error that the email address (customerserviceamericas@riu.com) was invalid. I am now planning on returning to Mexico again, with a large group, and my disgust of Riu's lack of professionalism has risen again. I am new to trip advisor, and felt I should let everyone else know my negative experience, and Riu's lack of resolution. I have brought Riu a whole lot of business and do not understand why I have not been contacted about this issue\u2026especially during a time they were hurting with the scare of the swine flu. Customer service should be at its peak to ensure repeat business at these times. It is very disturbing to know that, even in a locker, my personal belongings were scavenged thru by Riu's staff members and I was robbed. This makes me second guess the security of the safes in the rooms too. I really wanted this issue taken care of, and am really upset with the lack of follow-up Riu has put into this matter. I did not expect the staff to be so rude, and for security not to take my situation seriously. I strongly request for someone at Riu to contact me with some resolution to this issue. I will post the resolution to this matter on Trip Advisor, if there is one. Until then, I will strongly advise anyone NOT to stay at any Riu Resort.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT\u201d", "Author": "art1139", "ReviewID": "UR44829298", "Content": "My Wife and I just returned from RIU Palace Riviera Maya, and had one of the best time ever.

We found the resort to be excellent in every respect and really find the negative reviews puzzling (the few that there are). We were in a standard room on the ground floor of the south wing almost in the center. The room was garden view and was very nice. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever had in Mexico (none of the infamous hard Mexican bed). The room was nicely appointed and was kept immaculate by housekeeping. We were very happy with the room. The main lobby is very nice and the lobby bar, with piano music in the evenings, is a nice place to have a drink and relax. The area just outside the lobby building, called La Plaza is also a good place to relax in the evening before dinner with a cocktail. Each evening there was musical entertainment here and it changed day to day. Just off the plaza is the theatre where shows are presented in the evening. We found the shows to be pretty much like any show presented by a resort in Mexico \u2013 not spectacular but none the less entertaining. The pools are excellent as is the swim up bar. The drinks made at the pool are generous and well made. Those people that accused the drinks of being watered down must be hard core drunks that like their liquor straight up. Every drink we had was extremely strong. The strong point of this resort is the beach and beach sitting area. It is huge with many chairs (and beach waiters taking drink orders). The beach is actually two levels, with chairs on both levels. The upper level is completely private and access is allowed only to RIU guests. The lower level is on the public beach. The sand is soft and white and there are no rocks to speak of. The water is clear and the sand stays white and soft akk the way into the sea. The only time we ever saw sea weed was very early in the mornings before the staff had raked it up. During the day the water was clear and very clean. Snorkeling is very good right off the beach, especially around the sand bags out in the water. All in all one of the best beaches we have spent time on in Mexico. We found the food to be of high quality and very well prepared. Breakfast is served buffet style and offers a wide variety of items, including cook to order omelets and tortas. Each day the items were changed up a bit so a nice variety was always on offer. Lunch is served in an open air area by the pools and offers pizzas, burgers, hot dogs as well as a wide variety of other foods and a salad bar and dessert bar. The food here was excellent as well. We ate in the reservation ala carte restaurant \u201cKrystal\u201d twice and the Steak House. Both were very good but we liked Krystal best. We did not eat in the other ala carte places or the evening buffet. We were quite happy with the food.

They then direct you to the guys at the side which try and get you to go to the presentation, they ask you to plunk down 100 dollars cash which you supposedly get back at the presentation. We talked to some people at the hotel who did do this deal and they said they got a great deal on trips to Tulum and Chichen Itza as well as a spa visit. The presentation was 3 hours. Just a warning. As for the hotel, it was very nice, clean. The sheets were crisp and clean. The beds were firm and I didn't like feeling hubby's every move but I slept well. You can ask for different pillows. The bath tub is a bit darker but just pull back the curtain a bit you have enough light to do what you need to do. The tub is a very big step over almost two feet. The toilets didn't work great. However, I didn't know that in Mexico there are waste bins to put your toilet paper in as tgeir septic system doesn't do so well. I couldn't bring myself to do that.

The 5th avenue streets are out the front door and to the right, there are a couple very small ruins on the way that were interesting and there is a bird aviary as well. The walk is 15 minutes at a slow steady pace. Silver should be 3-6 dollars a gram depending on the detail. We made them weigh and dealt from there. A silver filigree locket they wanted $78 and I got it for $24. Silver is mostly plated unless in the hotels, They call it el paca and if you ask some will tell you it is. This hotel gave us 30% off for cash and even better deals if you bought more than 1 item. We had a bit of problem making a local call due to language and the fron desk helped us. Our local call for 5 minutes was 38 pesos. We went to cozumel for the day, scooters are 20 bucks for the day. A ride in the cab around the island was well worth the 45 bucks as the driver stops at all his friends stores at the beach. Good shots for the camera. The flea market had some good prices on blankets.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cSlamming Doors\u201d", "Author": "GregStLouis_Missouri", "ReviewID": "UR43130435", "Content": "My only complaint is that the room doors are very loud when closed and we were awakened every night by slamming doors.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat trip, great resort, great location and great staff!\u201d", "Author": "RockyMtnTraveler77", "ReviewID": "UR43130290", "Content": "We just returned from a week at the Rui Palace Riviera Maya and would recommend the resort for those looking for a combination of good food, a very nice pool and a large sandy beach.

This resort has a low key night live. If you are looking for a disco, then you might want to consider another resort. 2.) While the dinners in the buffet are nice, you should try several, or all, of the special dinner restaurants, but be prepared to put up with the pain of the process for reservations. 3.)

The fridge wasnt working and the floor was wet so we asked to be moved. The next room had a nice garden view but at night we encountered problems with the power. The electricity kept going off ever hour or so - which ment the fan and AC would also go off. We would switch the breaker and it would come on - temporairly. We tried to call the reception desk but no answer at 2 or 3 a.m. The next day we told them and they had someone come and look at it - but that night it happened again. And then again the next night - so someone came to look at it again. It didnt help and finally they offered to change our room, but we didnt want to move all our stuff. The good: service, the entertainers and wait staff were all super friendly, fun activities (water volleyball, beach party, snorkeling, kayaking, night shows). The bartenders and wait staff were great -- yeah Islas! It was my friends birthday and they brought her champange and chocolate strawberrries which was a nice touch. The beach was very nice, the relaxing loungers in the palms were great. Nice beach service for drinks. Would be nice to have food service as well, but that would be hard to keep up with. Swimming in the ocean was nice once you get past the large sandbags - they cause the water to be a little dirty. The water was very calm when we were there and very refreshing. We did a snorkeling excursion through the hotel (no good snorkeling unless you take a boat to a reef 20 minutes) and the guide was great. It was only $30 per person, so not too bad. We also took out the kayaks, did a snorkeling demo, played beach and water volleyball, and did some of the activities. The ok: food at the restaurants were just ok. We tried the Mexican and it was decent, you would expect better in Mexico. Then we tried the Fusion which was pretty good. The buffets were ok - I just have a weak stomach and couldnt find out what was getting to me. The drinks were ok if you like sweet stuff - I dont, and had a hard time finding something that I could drink without being syrup tasting. They had a gym but the ac was always not working so it was too hot inside. Free room service 24-7 was nice -- the food wasnt too good, but it came within 10 minutes so that was GREAT! I walked around to some of the other RIU properties and this was the nicest - we went to the Disco at the RIU Tequila and that was fun as well.

Ice machine at the end of the hall. Digital safe in room, free to use. We had a great view of the court yard from our balcony. All the gardens and courtyard were always immaculate, staff were always cleaning, sweeping, mopping, and they were always smilling and saying 'hola' all the time! Shows at night were good, and John the waiter was great. He remembered what we liked to drink and had them brought out to us before we had even ordered. Buffet was excellent, as good as the a la carte restaurants. These were easy to book too. When you walk through the doors the reception area will take your breathe away, fresh flower arrangements on huge tables and huge vases, stunning. Checking in was quick and the staff were brilliant, even giving us a free room upgrade on arrival. Overall this holiday was amazing, as good as it gets!!! I would go back there tomorrow no questions.

So I'll start from the very beginning. You can book your travel through www.riu.com, but I recommend you sign up with Riu Class as you will earn points and there are some perks with the card which is FREE. Now when booking you can book just the hotel or hotel and flight. Either way you are given FREE Transportation to/from the hotel ... this is where the fun begins! TRANSPORTATION: My recommendation is to use Cancun Transfers (www.Cancuntransfers.com) for your round trip shuttle to/from the airport. We paid $110 for 2 people round trip to/from the airport/hotel. After we got through customs a gentleman was standing there with our names, just outside the airport. He took us to our shuttle (a NICE new Excursion with leather interior). We arrived at our hotel in exactly 50 minutes. At the end of our trip Cancun Transfes were in the lobby waiting for us and we arrived at the airport in plenty of time. Now if you choose the FREE shuttle service, do not expect to arrive in 50 minutes, but rather about 3+ hours. The FREE service is there to pick up ALL Riu customes and until the bus is full (typically) they don't leave the airport. RPRM (Riu Palace Riviera Maya) is the LAST stop so, the $110 (tip was not included) is well worth the extra money!!!! HOTEL: This trip was to celebrate my husbands birthday and our anniversary. Upon checking in we were immediately upgraded to a garden view room and inside our room awaited champaign and chocolate covered strawberries. The room was very clean. Our mini refridgerator was making a humming noise so I called the front desk and within 15 minutes maintenace was out to fix the noise. We were in room 1065 which is right next to the nightly entertainment. My only concern was the noise level if we had decided to turn in early; however, one night we were in bed by 10 and could not hear anything inside our room. The view was perfect, as we could see the entire court yard, watch the entertainment from our balcony, and even see the pool and a small portion of the ocean. ALCOHOL: Last year they provided Corona this year its Dos Equis. There are no light beers on the resort, so if you're watching your figure, forget it you're on vacation enjoy a few extra calories. The drinks were too sweet for us to really enjoy, and this is what I also experienced last year. The trick to the drinks can be two fold. One if you're wanting to drink at the pool, purchase a large mug (we bought a Bubba Keg 34 oz <www.bubbakeg.com> which kept our water, beer, drinks cold for over 8 hours!!!!). The humidity will melt your drinks before you get the 1st sip, so the insulated cup is worth while to take with you. Now if you can find a bartender to make you good drinks, then pull a few dollars out as they will go a long way on your trip. We loved the bartender 'Islas' (aka: Pape) at the La Habana bar just inside the hotel. His mojitos and expresso martini were to die for. Everything he made was to perfection, not too strong, not too weak, not too much simple syrup!!! In your room you have a selection of Bacardi Rum, Smirnoff Vodka, Jose Cuervo Tequilla, and Brandy. The refridgerator will be stocked with 4 beers, and several mixers (only sodas no juice), such as Pepsi, Pepsi Light, Orange Soda, and 7up. If you like cranberry juice or others you should go down to 5th avenue and purchase some to keep in your fridge! ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment is good considering you're in Playa. Do not go with the expectation of a vegas show! We watched the Michael Jackson show and it was actually pretty good. There were a few others that we watched from outside in the courtyard, but this year the shows didn't impress me as much as last year. All shows start at 9:45 PM and last approximately 1 hour. DINING: This is the tricky part so pay attention. There are a total of 5 restaurants, Don Manolo (Buffet style breakfast and dinner), Chilis (Buffet style lunch/snacks and at night opens into a restaurant), Krystal (fusion), Yashima (Japanese), Agave (Mexican), and Botafogo (Brazilian Rodizio). Every morning Do Manolo serves breakfast from 7 am - 10 am. The food is excellent and provides something for everybody. There is only coffee and no expresso! Now onto lunch. Lunch is served at Chilis which is located just across from the pool and has ocean views (not many). The food is pretty good (fish, salad bar, calamari, french fries). They serve a little of everything just to fill you up. Onto dinner...this is the tricky part. Dinner at Chilis, Krystal, Yashima, Agave, and Botofogo ALL require reservations. Seats fill up quickly and reservations are taken from noon - 3 pm upstairs near the La Habana bar. You can make reservations for up to 3 nights. Dinner is served either at 6:30 or 8:45. Each dinner lasts about 1 1/2 hours. If you can't get reservations then you can eat at Don Manolo which in my opinion is excellent food (considering you're at an all inclusive!!). While on this trip our favorite in order was Chilis (steak and lobster), Agave (mexican), Yashima(Japanese), Botofogo (Brazillian), and Krystal (fusion). Men are not allowed to wear tank tops to any of the restaurants. Shorts are allowed at ALL but Krystal and Yashima as these two allow only men to wear pants. If you try to enter in shorts you will be rejected. Women can wear an array of anything from shorts and tanks, to sun dresses. EXCURSIONS: This trip the only excursion we took was to Cozumel. If you plan to go, plan ahead, take the 7 am ferry so you can have time to really enjoy the island. There are two ferry companies, so my recommendation is to buy a one way ticket so you're not confined to the time restraints of every 2 hours (arrivals and departures). Besides there is no savings to buy round trip with the same company. The trip there and back was $48 per person ($24 each way) and takes about 45 minutes. We rented scooters from Charlies at the docking area in Playa. We paid $25 US and once we were in Cozumel we paid an additional $15 US for the insurance (to cover the comprehensive/collision). The $25 paid for the helmet, liablity insurance (coverage if you hurt somebody else or damage property), gas, etc. Bring a backpack so you can wear it if you rent scooters, with your snorkle gear, money, passport, etc. There are several nice areas along the way to stop and snorkle, and lots of photo opps. My husband saw some amazing coral and fish life! It will take all day to travel around the island so plan to be gone about 10 hrs if you really want to enjoy all the sites. Oh and bring cash, if you don't buy round trip tickets on the ferry they will only take cash no credit cards! We had JUST enough cash to buy tickets back, not a penny or peso more! The clerks working at the Ferry dock were not very friendly. It's definately a trip worth taking!!!!!! All in all the trip was amazing, we will be going back. We stayed 5 days and 4 nights which was just enough time. Next year we're thinking of going to the Riu in Cancun for 3 days then heading down to Playa for 3 additional days. If you have questions please feel free to ask, this is my 2nd trip to the same resort and in my opinion this place is top notch! There will always be those who find something to complain about, I'd just ignore most of the negative comments because if you read most of the reviews over 90 - 95% are positive!", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFelt like we were in a Spanish Palace, set on a gorgeous beach!\u201d", "Author": "traveler266", "ReviewID": "UR41677213", "Content": "We had a fabulous 3 night stay at Riu Palace Riviera Maya, June 2009. We were greeted and \"welcomed home\" when we arrived -- check-in was quick and easy -- and we were offered a refreshing fruit drink and cold towel. The bellman took our luggage and escorted us to our room -- what a beuatiful view of the stunning landscaped grounds ! The bellman made sure everything was in working order and the room was to our satisfaction before leaving. We easily made dinner reservations for 2 nights by going to the lobby and speaking with the maitre'd , and then we headed off to the pool and beach. You won't believe this -- the beach has bar service -- waiters come by on a regular basis to take drink orders ! The beach has a ''forest\" of deep green palm trees that provide some shade for those who want to lay on the beach chaises . There are also chaises out in the sun, too. NO problem getting a chaise, any time of day !! The pool is huge-- and has in-pool tiled lounges and jacuzzi jets at the in-pool tables set up for having drinks IN the pool ! We saw the free introductory scuba lessons taking place in the pool, but didn't participate. Dinners were wonderful -- our favorites were the Mexican and the Continental Fusion restaurant -- great choices -- well prepared ! (Make sure to try the guacamole and salsa when you visit the buffet -- the recipes are wonderful ! ) As for drinks -- Margaritas and Cosmopolitians were perfectly made -- and the Mexican beer served was outstanding! Service is excellent , everywhere at this resort ! The staff is so friendly, and ready to help ! What a difference from our stay at a Florida resort .... !! At night, there is a jazz pianist playing during the dinner hours, near the lobby bar. Evening entertainment is offered in their show lounge --- the performers give the audience a great show -- we were not sure we would find the fire dancers to our liking -- but we were amazed at the skill and daring those guys showed, as they put on an hour-long show! Another evening, a Mexican mariachi band gave a great performance, too -- highlighting the culture of the region. This Riu resort is perfectly located if you want to walk into Playa del Carmen -- just a short 15 minute walk -- walk along the sidewalk, in the \"million dollar golf course community\" of Playacar, and in 15 minutes you are at the shops in Playa del Carmen. Along the way, you will walk past some Mayan ruins located just off the sidewalk -- great photo opportunity ! We can't wait until December --- we loved the Riu Palace Riviera Maya so much, we are going back for a week ! ( One note -- we have friends who visit Cancun often -- they told us to make sure to use the bottled water provided in the rooms for brushing teeth and drinking -- we did -- and didn't have any problems with upset stomachs .

Breakfast is only served from 8 to 10 and after that you will only find snacks in the restaurant (Chilis) by the pool. The same happens with lunch, schedule restricted and the only thing available is cold, dry, old \u201csnacks\u201d in the same restaurant by the pool. The service is awful, the personnel there just don\u2019t care about customer service, seriously they have an attitude problem. We arrived at 3:20 at the front desk for check in and we were informed that to have dinner in one of the \u201ca la carte\u201d restaurants you had to make a reservation but only until 3:00 PM. So the first night we had to eat snacks again for dinner. The next day I went to the hostess to make a reservation for dinner that night and I was very rudely informed by this lady that all restaurants were already booked and there was nothing left! Even though the hotel was clearly half empty! I assume that they make your life difficult to force you to have lunch or dinner somewhere else to cut their costs. The rooms are really hideous, we booked two doubles and we found out that all their rooms are extremely small, with two double beds pulled together in the middle of the room. That was really uncomfortable. Trying to save space by doing this is really cheap. The toilets in the reception area \u2013for guests- were repugnant, I tried to use one and had to go out to report to a manager the state of all the toilets. Drinks are good and they just keep coming but, once again, schedule is very restricted.

Just got home last night, was there Tuesday-Saturday. Been on 6 or 7 cruises and 1 other all-inclusive in the Dominican. This trip was great. Any really negative reviews you read are most certainly flukes. We were a group of 4, 3 female and 1 male, that'd be me :) Ages from 28-32, like to have a good time but fear our best crazy partying days are behind us. Arrival in Cancun was painless, we used Cheap Caribbean and had set up private transfers with Olympus. About 45 minutes to get to our hotel. When you first walk in it is amazing, palacial even, but the best part was it is airconditioned. We requested two adjoining rooms in the Jr. Suite Superior category which just meant we had a courtyard view instead of exterior view. Didn't spend much time on the balcony so no biggie, not sure if it's worth the extra $100 or so. We were on the ground floor, rooms 103 and 102, middle building, perfectly placed between the pool/ocean and the lobby/restaurants. Come to think of it, if you are trying to sleep early, you may want an exterior view as the shows and music after 9:45 can be a little loud, not noticeable if you have the TV or fan on, but if your room is quiet, you may hear what's going on outside. The room was well appointed with marble everywhere. Stocked mini-bar with Orange soda, club soda, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Dos-Equis beer and 4 bottles of water. They were refilled everyday, plus you can get more water at the sports bar off the lobby. There was a liquor dispensor that had Absolut Vodka, Cuervo Tequila, Bacardi Rum and some sort of Brandy. Two double beds were pushed together to make a King, not the greatest if you and your partner are snugglers as one would have to be on the crack in the middle, but my wife and I have been married long enough we didn't need to be that close. Ha ha, just kidding honey. There was a Sony flat screen TV that had a few English Speaking channels. The A/C was COLD! I don't know if other people left their balcony door cracked or something because that shuts off the A/C, but ours and our friends' worked wonderfully. I swear I could see my breath a few times. I love the cold, I hate sleeping when I'm hot. Pool was great! We spent more time in the \"Infinity\" pool which was calm and away from the party part of the main pool. Chair availability didn't seem to be a problem. Overall the resort seemed at about 60-70% capacity, never had to wait for anything. Waiters were constantly walking around asking you if you needed a drink. The main pool had water volleyball set up throughout most of the day. They also had concrete tables and benches as well as concrete loungers on both sides of the pool. The water was lukewarm I'd say, not too cold, not too hot, just about right. Pool cleanliness didn't seem to be an issue. The beach had an upper and lower section, the upper had trees all around it so you could stay in the shade, the lower part was all about sun. Loungers seemed in good supply in both sections. Drink service was adequate I'd say, seems like when I really wanted one it was scarce, when I was feeling blah, the waiter was there every 5 minutes. Yes there are beach bags or whales in the water but there is PLENTY of open area for playing in the ocean. Beach seemed clean to me, sure there was some seaweed but it is the ocean, not a filtered swimming pool for Pete's sake. We ate breakfast in the Main Buffet every morning, food was good. Not gourmet, but it is a buffet. Lots of options though. Lunch we ate in the Main Buffet as well, once we ate at the Beach Buffet which turns into the steakhouse at night, food quality was just as good, but selection was lacking a little. For dinner we ate at the Buffet the first night and it was excellent, we then tried the Brazilian, Steakhouse and Japanese. They were all excellent. We had a very picky eater in our group and she seemed very pleased which shocked me, this girl doesn't eat cheese, vegetables or fruit for crying out loud! If she can be happy, anybody can be happy. We went to the shows every night. The Michael Jackson show was very good, the others I would call not quite Cruise ship quality. Cruise ship quality of course is not Broadway Quality. They were entertaining, but as long as you don't expect the London Cast of Phantom of the Opera, you won't be disappointed. Everything is lip-synched. They are really trying, the \"animacion\" staff are there from 9am until 11pm. I mean wow, that a long day of smiling and being entertaining. One day we walked down the beach to check out the other resorts, the Riu Palace Riviera Maya is by far the best on the surface anyways. We went into the other Riu's and the Riviera Maya was superior in many ways. I guess the \"Palace\" class is the top tier. We had better choices of top-shelf booze than the other Riu's. The biggest difference is that our Restaurants, (except the beach buffet/steakhouse), Lobby and showroom were air-conditioned! This is huge as it is very very hot and steamy. It's nice to have someplace cool to sit and have a drink. There is a little jewelry shop in the lobby as well as a gift shop that sells essentials. Rather high priced but they'll have most of what you need if you run out of say suntan lotion. They have an abridged version of USA Today available if you need your daily news fix. My biggest cautionary tale, watch the exchange rate. It is currently about $1 USD = $12.5 Pesos. So a $20 bill should be $250 Pesos. Watch your change. I tried to get change at the internet station, I wanted to change a $10 US bill for $5 peso coins for the pool table and he tried to only give me $100 pesos in return. I would actually suggest changing out a hundred bucks or so into pesos for small purchases. $20 pesos bills are perfect for tips. A cab ride anywhere in Playa is $50 pesos or about $4 US. We took a cab into town to shop on 5th Avenue or La Quinta and go to Senor Frogs. The shop keepers are quite pushy there, just keep walking and say No Gracias. If you want a Henna Tattoo, your hair braided, weed or cocaine though, they'll gladly oblige. The little shop area in Playacar next to the hotel has the same stuff and not as pushy sales people. Theres a currency exchange at these shops as well. There is a US dollar ATM as well as a pesos ATM at Senor Frogs. As we only had 4 full days we didn't do any tours so I can't help you there. The resort kinda goes dead after the show lets out at 11pm. The only bar open after midnight is the sports bar which is where we spent most nights, it is 24 hours. Victor and Antonio were good bartenders. There were nachos, fruit, sandwiches and hamburgers and hot dogs in the refrigerated case in there you could heat up for a late snack. The trip back to Cancun to the airport was uneventful.

Entertainment team are a credit to the Hotel they work so hard and all so friendly especially Edna from the childrens club. One good thing about staying at the Palace is you can use the facilities of the other RIU Hotels and after visiting them we had made the best choice to stay here.

RIU Palace Riviera Maya and Iberostar Tucan. I will write the tucan today as well for everyone to see. Background: Just got married, two social drinkers who like to have a good time Check in: Flawless. We checked in about an hour early and they had a room ready for us. The people at the front desk were very professional and explained everything that was included and gave us our keys, called a bellman, and we were on our way Room: We actually switched rooms. We had room 99, which was on the bottom floor, but wanted to move, so the front desk didn't have a problem with it, moved us the next day. **there was a snag. Our toilet had to be manually flushef for the first few days, but we are on vacation, so who really cares. Other than that, we had a great view of the pool and courtyard from our room. I would highly recommend upgrading to courtyard if you get a chance. Also, you can keep your room at a brisk 65 degrees which is great for sleeping. Pool: Honestly, I think there were way too many people that decided that the pool was a bathroom, since it was warmer then the 100 degree weather we had outside. The pool bar is great though, although the bartenders weren't all that friendly. The infinity pool was the way to go if you could get a good server to get you drinks. Beach: Outstanding, if you have snorkel equipment, bring it, as you can see fish around the beach guard things in the water. Entertainment: we saw a show or two but I think I have seen better. The people on stage are great, but the set up was a little odd. Bars: What is nice about the RIU is you get to use all the other resorts. We counted 15 different bars that you can walk to. It was great. They have the best bartender at the lobby bar, Islas, the man. He remembers what you drink and your name everytime you see him. He makes a good Kamikasi's. Sports bar was fun as well. Food: The food here was decent. It had some great moments and some not so good ones. I like the buffett. Stay away from the Brazilian. Mexican was great. Steak house is great. One thing I like about RIU RM is you can make two reservations a day, which allows you to eat at all the specialty restaurants, unlike all other resorts. Service: Mediocre - I thought the specialty restaurants were a mixed bag for service, and the pool bar staff weren't too friendly. I do think the staff works hard, and overall they were good. People at the resort: Awesome. We met some great people, Jake & Caitlyn, Okey and Sheli. We have to say that there was just some great people at this place. We were sad to leave. We even met a Harry Potter look-a-like. Everyone is extremely friendly on this resort, unlike other places I have stayed. You will run into more of the English, American, Canadians, Scottish/Irish here. Overall we had an amazing time at the RIU thanks to the beauty of the resort and the people we met. I can't wait to go back. If you are a fussy eater or a non-sociable person, or a family, I would say this might be a 2nd choice for you. For families, I found the Iberostar much better than the RIU ***FREE WIFI in the loby is key*** Iberostar $13 a day - Cheers", "Date": "September 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "worcester", "Title": "\u201ctropical parasdise that not even swine flu could spoil.\u201d", "Author": "holidayWorcester", "ReviewID": "UR39771902", "Content": "We have just returned back from a truly wounderful holiday at the riu palace, before we chose this hotel, we read the reviews on this site, and i would say do not be put off by what some people write, we found this a great hotel and holiday from start to finish. We arrived at Cancun airport and found immigration no problem at all, quick and easy, the coach journey was also good, beer on the coach very cold and refreshing after a long flight, it cost 3dollars, and worth every dollar. On arrival at the hotel it looked stunning from the outside, but it did not prepare you for what it was like on the inside, some other reviews complained of a musty smell, yes you could smell it but what would you expect in a country that is hot with a high humidty, but honeslty this was not a problem. The lobby area is breath taking and once inside the air conditioning is just what you need. The staff made checking in so easy and no hassle. The room was lovley, very clean with a well stocked optics bar and fridge, this was also re-stocked every day.The room was cleaned to a high standard every day, room service was great and very quick, unlike what some reviews had said on here. The grounds of the hotel are spotless, the swimming pool's are great, although we did not use the pool's as we chose to spend our time on the wounderful beach, and what a beach it is, there is no problem getting into the water, again we had read some reviews of people complaining of it being very rocky in the water, let me tell you, there is no problem with this at all, we would recommend you take your snorkel set, as the fish to see are amazing. When down at the beach the waiter serivce is unbelievable, one person in particular was always there when you needed light refreshment, Jose, he worked all hours of the day and night, and nothing was too much for him, or any of the other staff, we found them all very friendly and always willing to help, they work so hard and still remain very pleasant. The buffet resturant was very good, altough you must try the speciality resturants, we tryed the mexican, brazilian, steak house and the gourmet, steak house was lovley but our favourite was the gourmet, this was truly remarkable and a must, my only regret was not going back for another sitting.

Our a/c didn't work and they refused to fix it, and when I called to tell them about it, they told me to walk the 2 miles back to the main lobby. They wouldn't change our room even though it was uncomfortably warm. The service at the restaurants and bars was just as bad, if not worse. They were extremely unaccommodating and smug. Cocky and rude. Why should they care? It's all inclusive and they don't receive tips. 2. The place is HUGE. Disneyland huge, and just as cheesy. 3. The food was HORRIBLE. The only thing myself and my friends felt comfortable eating was nachos. The buffets were full of unidentifiable foods that reminded me of the lunch line back in grade school. 4. They wouldn't give us bottled water at the restaurants or bars. 5. If you are in college or fresh out of college, and you want the feeling that you are on Spring Break, then you will like this place. Otherwise, stay somewhere else. I am too old to feel like a Spring Breaker when I go on vacation.

As I loved the hotel so much I made sure to come back with family instead for a 7 night stay (17-24 August 2009). However, I have to say that they are definitely cutting costs in the food! First, at breakfast they don't have anymore a sandwich station, where a chef did make to order delicious sandwiches. Also they don't have the same variety of natural juices. My favorite juice, which was the tangerine one, wasn't there anymore. Also I noticed that they reduced their seafood stock. In my last trip they had shrimps at almost any meal, caviar at least 2 times a week and this time I only found 1 dessert with caviar the whole 7 nights I was there (shrimp only in speciality restaurants). Also no strawberries (only in syrup) or mango this time. Also, not even once was I approached at the pool or at the beach to be asked for drinks. Last time I got offered drinks without even have to ask! I don't mind to walk a few meters to the bar, however it was supposed to have a beach/pool service which I didn't see this time! The room I got has better than last time (a 3rd floor room with an awesome ocean view) with no musty smell! However this time got only towel animals twice (last time it was everyday) and also got no gift (last time got a kind letter by the reception with a miniature of the Chichen-Itza pyramid). Also, the last night I was there (Sunday) it was supposed to have a show with professional singers (tradicional mexican songs, which I saw last time), however without notice they had a dance competition instead with guests of the hotel. It was fun, however If I had known this before I would have gone to the Palace Mexico for the Mayan night! These were definitely the most negative points I found out this time. However not everything was bad! This time, they had 2 fantastic beach parties held by the animation team! Speaking of which, they were amazing as always! Working 12-14 hours a day isn't easy, however they have so much energy that I'm always amazed with! Also the service at the restaurants was very good as always! Even though the self-service drink machine was down most of the days at the beach restaurant, they were more than happy to bring you anything you want!

Did anyone stop to think that after being in the hot sun all day, it's nice to get into a little darker, cooler place (and there is plenty of light)? \"Musty smell\"? I didn't notice it. \"Cups around the pool\"? It's a gorgeous pool with a pool bar, how about faulting the tourist crowd for leaving things around, rather than the extremely hard-working hotel staff working to keep up with them? Have a room \"that opens up onto another hotel\"? That other hotel is a few hundred feet away, and is separated by a beautifully manicured garden setting the Riu Palace maintains. In other words, ignore any bad reviews you might see of this place (and from what I've seen, you'll have to go a ways back to find any). I've stayed at some extremely nice hotels around the world (Fairmonts, Four Seasons, etc.), and the Riu Palace Riviera Maya easily matches up. From the moment you walk in, you're treated like royalty. Anything you want/need, is at your fingertips in an instant. The rooms are beautiful and spotless. Housekeeping left us with a different towel oragami animal every day that delighted my wife. The pool is gorgeous, beach is beautiful and right there next to the pool. The beer is good and cold, food excellent, service great. Get up early any morning and witness a virtual army of help and cleaning staff working to keep the Riu Palace spotless.

All inclusive entitled us to food and drink 24 hours a day if we so desired. Waiters would even bring cocktails onto the beach. Not to be missed, the kitchen tour - spotless - and very interesting. The hotel are proud of their level of hygiene. The staff were very attentive and worked hard. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble so we were only too happy to tip those staff who had served us. The buildings are palatial and spotless. We had a standard room which looked onto an adjoining hotel, but it was again cleaned daily to a high standard and was spacious, with double sinks and a spa bath with shower in bathroom. The only negative I can say here is that the ceiling fan needs to be on constantly to reduce humidity, and this can be rather noisy at night. We did purchase one trip to Xelha and Tulum which we thoroughly enjoyed. The trip was expensive but the guide was very knowledgeable and concise. However he had a stock of waterproof cameras for sale at $15, which were supposedly cheaper than Xelha; we gave him $20, but never received change . . . so that was his tip! Then, a WARNING for shoppers at Xelha . . . we purchased a couple of souvenirs and confirmed with the assistant beforehand that she could exchange $50. Change was given in Pesos and by the time we had converted to sterling and checked receipt we realised we had been given the change of $20 instead of the $50! Expensive learning curve and the moral of story for fellow travellers and our next trip to Mexico - take Pesos or Dollars in lower denominations. Another WARNING - Taxi to Playa del Carmen should be $5 from hotel. Check with driver beforehand that this is the fee as one wanted to charge us $200!

Upon entering Playacar (the gated neighborhood the hotel is located in), I knew it was going be nice. Playacar is loaded with beautiful homes and condos. When I entered the hotel lobby, I was amazed at its grandeur. It was breathtaking. Crystal, marble, mahogany, stained glass, granite and wrought iron all over. It is nicely done. We had a Junior Suite that was really nice as well with a huge 10x12 terrace overlooking the courtyard. The terrace was my favorite room amenity. The hotel is shaped like a U so there arent many ocean view rooms. It is either Courtyard or Garden view. Courtyard is a really good view. The grounds are amazing. It is spotless wherever you go and they are constantly cleaning and grooming and polishing. The pool is huge and we could always get an area with available seats. There were plenty of market umbrellas to get away from the sun. Even on the beach there were plenty of palm trees to shield the sun. The beach sand was fine and white and the ocean water is crystal clear. My only complaint about the pool was that it wasn't cool enough. It didn't give that refreshing feeling you want from being soaked up by the sun all day. My kids loved every minute of it. the pool bar was great as well. Service. Bar none, it was great. We love Rosario and Gustavo. They hooked us up all week long. Even though tips are included, tip anyway. $5.00 every fre rounds goes a long way there. You become like a celebtrity. Over the whole week, it was the best $150 I spent. In my room I needed more towels and more pillows. both calls were delivered within 3 minutes. The food was average at best. There are two buffets. Don Manolo is the main breakfast buffet and it was filled with variety and was plentiful. Don Manolo & Chilis do lunch. It was basic and food was boring after the 2nd day. Regarding the restaurants, We ate in every one except the Japanese restaurant. The Mexican was great as well as the fusion restaurant Kristal. The Braziallan was really good as well and the steakhouse was OK. still, the service at the restaurant was great. The nightlife is not that great. There is usually a band in the evening from 7:30 or so until 9:30 then there is some sort of show in the theater. Most of them were amateur at best. We were cool with that because I had an 8 and 10 year old with us and we weren't looking for that crazy spring break-ish nightlife. The overall client was right up our alley. It was mostly an upscale crowd that I felt very comfortable with. As for the drinks... The grade of alchohol needs to be better. I didn;t love the drinks, although I consumed many of them. My kids loved being able to go get non-alchoholic beverages whenever they wanted. I highly recommend doing the Dolphin Discovery. We had a blast doing that. It was the most costly thing we did on the trip but worth every penny. I would go back there or to another Riu in a heartbeat. If I were travelling with just my wife, I would not do an all-inclusive though. I would want the freedom to go to any restaurant I favor. The one thing that you must do if you go to the Riviera Maya is go to the beach at 5:30 in the morning and watch the sunrise. That was my own personal highlight of the whole trip. I have some amazing pictures of that. I hope this helps you out in choosing a destination. Overall, I give it an 8 out of a 10. One point was lost due to the food and the other is the lack of nightlife. i highly recommend it if this is the type of trip you are looking for.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canyon, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Trip\u201d", "Author": "moe40moe", "ReviewID": "UR37151320", "Content": "We went the first week of August and had a wonderful time, there was fourteen in our group.

My husband, myself, and our guests have all traveled a lot to different all inclusives and this was by far our favorite. The servers are very nice and deserve tips. We tipped them well because they work so hard and deserve it. We would order a drink and then they would have another one waiting on us. Our favorite drinks were the miami vice and mimosas. We stayed in the 2 story jacuzzi suite and it was spectacular. There was marble everywhere and we had a fantastic view. The bathrooms and closet were spacious enough for all our things. I went into my guests rooms as well and all were very nice. The suite is worth the money. Room service is prompt and good at the hotel. The bars are very fun and the bartenders work very quickly. The entertainment was very good. I was impressed. We saw the Vegas show and liked it a lot. The beach is gorgeous and the sand whales help with the waves. They didn't bother us at all because they blend in as they are covered with barnacles. Our wedding was so beautiful at the gazebo and the staff went above and beyond our expectations. Our guests had a great time and they pampered us endlessly. I am a very picky person and I loved this hotel and I definitely will be back. Please say hello to our favorites: Jose, Chano, and Gustavo! They were the best!!! We did the Delphinus swimming with the dolphins excursion and it was great. The dolphins were so sweet and gentle. Also, our favorite excursion was the Catamaya catamaran excursion. They served us great drinks, we snorkeled (I saw a sea turtle!), serve lunch (lobster, steak, or hamburgers, and we danced the day away!

It was simply a fantastic vacation. We really don't have anything to complain about. The only problem that we had was the lock of the door of one of our rooms constantly stopped working. After 3 days I have complained and the manager (Anilu) helped us solving the problem in the end. But, the Mexican people are simply wonderful, always friendly and the service was therefore unbelievably good. We were served with drinks from the lobby tothe entertainments to the swimming pool and even on the beach. The restaurants are good and easy to book between 12 and 3 every day. We went to all of them and loved the Japanese and Mexican the most. The Crystal is a very posh type of restaurant and it if very hard to get a booking, but the kids loved the other more relaxed restaurants better. We also loved the theme nights (Asian, Caribean and Mexican) at the buffet restaurant and for the kids it was nice to go at any time and the food was still excellent. The beach is really good and we did not have any problems with the whales and we fully understood that they were put there to protect the environment. We also went snorkeling on trips for $29US and we went parasailing for $60 per person and also jet skiing for $60 per ski. As for excursions we went on a private (for eight people with 3 friends) excursion to Chichin-itza combined with a swim in a cenote (must do) and a visit to a real Mayan village. It cost $100 per person and was worth every penny. We also did an excursion during which we could swim with sea turtles and that we booked with our tour operator Arke, but that was not good at all. Rather book at one of the guys that are sitting in the hotel. This was really one of our best vacations ever (we go to these kinds of 5 start all inclusive hotels every year).

This was not the case, at all. Hotel staff was very nice and so were the waiters and waitresses. The room was clean but the bed had a plastic cover over the mattress I assume to keep the mattress from being soiled by some sort of bodily fluid. Great idea but it made for very noisey moving when in bed. Also the rooms location was not the best since the view was of another buildings rooftop and the was very noisey. Other then that cannot complain about the room. We did not spend much time in it besides sleeping and getting ready. The buffet food was not bad. I love fresh fruit and salads and they had it here. Freshly cut with different cheeses and meats. They have junk food too cheeseburgers, pizza and hot dogs. Juices, soda and alcholic beverages. We actually preferred buffet over the restaurants because first off the reservations were a pain. You can actually reserve reataurant up to 2 days in advance. So we reserved 2 dates one at the Japanese resaturants and the other at the mexican. I thought the whole system sucked. First everyone should be able to get a chance to reserve a restaurant at least once while they stay at the hotel. Not be told all their dates but two are booked. Next we went to the Japanese Restaurant food was ok but what bothered me was the menu is set to only a few dishes and they bring everybodies food out at the pace people are eating. So if you scarf down your appetizer you have to wait until everyone else eats theirs to get your next dish. The buffet was much better food and much easier to just go get what you wanted. We did not even go to the mexican restaurant after the Japanese restaurant. The beach was beautiful very relaxing the pool was great kind of a pool party scene. Dont go to the pool to relax there are more people and it has a party vibe. The beach is where you go to relax. We paid $110 extra for private transportaion from Cancun to the front door of the Riu Palace. it was worth it driver was on time at the airport and at the hotel when flying back. Cancuntranfers is the name of the company I highly recommend them they have a website. We paid cash when they picked us up and had no problems. We paid $1400 for 5 days 4 nights all inclusive( airfare Hotel and food at the hotel). Overall I cannot complain it was a fun trip and the Hotel was fine.

The Jacuzzi bathtub was large with powerful jets. What a way to end the day! The restaurants were very nice and the quality of the food on a scale from 1-10 was an 8.5. We ordered lobster at Chili\u2019s and got a 2oz tail. I use bigger crayfish for bait. You have to go to the lobby every 2 days to make reservations this is a nuisance. The Brazilian steak house was not that great either. I thought Crystals was the best, had an elegant formal dinner. Now the positives and there are many. The pool bartenders were great make sure you order your drinks with top shelf liquor or they will use a house brand. They have some very good special tequila if you ask. We never had a problem getting a spot by the bar or pool. A short walk from the pool and you are on the beach. We went to Punta Cana last year and there were sharp rocks everywhere so I was hoping for a nice beach and this one is nice. There are large hurricane sand bags but it really calmed the water. The color of the sea is unreal blue, green, and turquoise beautiful!! We took an off resort trip to Xelha. XelHa is very nice, go to the website and check it out. I also golfed across the street at Plyacar an 18 hole course very tough nice and was very hot. One rainy afternoon we took a cab to Playa del Carmen for a shopping trip. One TIP do not wear a t-shirt with a name on it. (sports team, state ect.) The street vendors will be all over you. But it was fun. Lots of jewelry, a shopper is in paradise.

My wife received an extra day off that week so we decided to fly down to Riviera Maya a day early. Being a travel agent with AAA I have stayed at many resorts in this area including the RIU Palace Las Americas and the RIU Cancun. I booked a one night stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya using points that I had earned for selling RIU properties. When we arrived at check in we were told that our room was ready and that I needed to go make dinner reservations between 12 and 3 pm. We were taken to our room only to find it overlooking the air conditioning units on top of the restaurants at the Riu Palace Mexico. The sound from the units running in the evening made it impossible to sleep let alone to leave your balcony door open for a nice breeze. When I went to the desk to ask to be moved I was told that I would have to come back later and talk with the manager. We proceeded to the lunch buffet which was o.k. and then to the pool. When noon came around I went to the maitre'd to make a dinner reservation for that evening. It was only 12:15 and he informed me that there were no restaurants open for that evening or the next day so we would have to eat at the buffet again. I tried to explain to him that we were only there one night and that we already ate the buffet for lunch. He said there was nothing he could do. When I returned to the pool it was a very chaotic situation. The music was so loud you could not relax, even on the beach. The pool itself was filthy, there was fruit, glasses, straws etc floating everywhere. When I went to the bar to order a drink the bartender informed me that I would have to wait for clean glasses to be delivered. There were about 100 of them sitting all around the edge of the pool dirty and floating in the pool. Perhaps they should dive in and retrieve them? When I came back to the bar I was greeted by the sight of a 13 year old boy throwing up in a waste can due to \"too much tequila\" according to his mother that was screaming at the bartender. Now I dont' know what the drinking age is in Mexico but I am sure its not 13 and this young man looked every bit of his age. My wife and I finally had enough of the pool mess so we went back to the room to change. We went to the front desk to find the manager and was told that they could not move our room until the next day. ( Did they not see I was only staying one night?) Although I could upgrade to a suite for $150 per night if I wanted to! Also the manager seemed not to care that no one could get a dinner reservation for that evening as well. We talked to two other couples at the lobby bar who checked in that day and were only staying for 3 nights. They were told there were no reservations for the next 2 days as well. I hope they got a reservation for the third night because I would hate to have to eat that buffet for 3 days straight! Finally my wife and I decided we were going to move hotels even thought it was 4:00pm in the afternoon. The front desk clerk was gracious enough to look up the phone number for Secrets Maroma AND EVEN OFFERED TO DIAL IT FOR ME! There are many resorts to choose from in the Riviera Maya that cost the same as the RIU Palace Riviera Maya and I would recommend that you do your homework before booking here. As I said in the beginning I have had great experiences at other RIU Palace properties in the Dominican Republic and Cancun and hope that some day they could made this resort worth visiting. For the same cost you could stay at the Valentin Maya which is adults only and the food, service, and cleanliness is outstanding! P.S.

The 4th one (ours) took about 30 minutes. I'm going to go ahead and do a list like others have done since I really appreciated that! ROOMS: We all had Jr. Suites. Decent sized rooms. However, be prepared that they come with 2 double beds that are pushed together. They are a bit hard and the pillows are rather thin. The small sofa also makes out into a bed. The bathroom was nice- it's a big step over the side of the tub to get into the shower though. And the toilet doesn't always seem to have enough pressure to flush. The in room safe is there and we used it without any trouble what so ever. The mini fridge was stocked as was the liquor dispensor. It was a little musty smelling, but having read that on this site, I packed Plug-ins in my checked baggage, and so we had a room that smelled like cinnamon and apples! Our balcony looked over to another resort, which wasn't prety- but we didn't go there to stay in the room and look out the window! RESTAURANTS: I took the advice of another trip advisor user and emailed ahead for a reservation for the night we arrived. Got it without a problem, and was told to print a copy of the confirmation to bring with me. Good thing I did as they did not have us on the list. That was at Yashima. Hmmm....first problem was they did not want to puchs tables together to accomodate our group. Understandable if the place was full. It's a very small place. But after 20 minutes, it wasn't even half full. We ended up asking another waiter and they did push the tables together so we weren't separated. The service there is not the best. I would'nt even say it was good. From the time we ordered to the time we actually got served was an hour. I ate the teriyaki chicken skewers, which was very tasty. Good food, but it took way too long for a meal. Our second reservation was at the Brazillian restaurant ( I can't remember how to spell it). If you go there, go very hungry! It is a A LOT of food- and majority of it is meat. Slow service also, but not as bad. I thought it was good also. Our third reservation was for the Mexican. This was my favorite. Service again was pretty slow though. The food was very good- I had chicken fajitas. We ate at Don Manolo's for breakfast everyday- yum, yum, yum. We had lunch there or over at Chili's- again- yum, yum, yum. The food at both places was very good- even my teenagers liked it! POOL: Fabulous! Never had a problem finding a chair. Visited the pool bar quite often. Didn't take advice that I had seen on here that I wish I had. Bring your own cup- the cups they give you are the size of a juice glass! Sometimes the drinks were so [--] strong I couldn't drink them, but for the most part they were just yummy! The pool was wonderful in the mornings when the water was a bit cooler. Don't forget to use your towel cards- however if you didn't get out there right when they opened at 8 a.m. they would run out of towels until around 10. BEACH: is absolutely gorgeous!! The sand whales are there- but they really kind of blend in after a while! Twice they pumped water up onto the beach through a big tube from the ocean- don't know what that was for but we got to see cool shells! No problem finding chairs there either. Got to see a wedding on the beach which was beautiful. If you get tired of the sun there are plenty of palm trees to lay under. There is volleyball, ping pong, and water sports to do. Talk to Bruno at the scuba place- he's very nice! RESORT: Again- it is just a beautiful place! Their attention to details is amazing! Like others have said, there really is always somebody cleaning something! The wait staff was so friendly! If you get Santos in the evenings outside- tip him well. He does a great job! We went to the Michael Jackson show and were pleasantly surprised. I only wish we had seen the schedule sooner in the week. If you go out the back of the lobby through the bar and down the stairs, the schedule is on your right side around the corner by the Mexican restaurant. Remember to tip- it is really appreciated! Unfortunately, we booked an excursion to go snorkeling from a catamaran. The guy- Oliver- who sold it to us told us it was a 65 foot catamaran that was smooth sailing because of its size. Knowing nothing about catamarans, we believed him. We shouldn't have. What we should have done was just pay the $25 more per person and gone to Xel Ha. It was a 35 minute or so ride to the catamaran, which is a very pretty boat. This package came with lunch of either steak or lobster, and 2- 45 minute snorkeling sessions. Well, we got under way, and after about 10 minutes, the nausea started. The crew had me go up to the roof of the cabin, and that is where I, along with my kids and about 10 other people laid for the duration of the trip. I don't knw when I have been that sick. I didn't snorkel- and according to my family that did- it was very rough, unsafe and the guide wizzed through it. There was only 1 snorkeling session. I didn't eat my steak- I know 4 of us out of our group didn't eat. After 4 miserable hours, we finally got off. I started feeling better on the ride back to the resort, and when we got back we went and ate with no problem!! All in all, it was a wonderful vacation. Bring comfy walking shoes to walk into Playa del Carmen- only 20 minutes. Be careful of the people who you pay to hold a monkey while you get your picture taken- the monkeys stink. My sister in laws' shoulder stunk even after a shower and perfume. Yuck.

The hotel is fabulous; truly a palace. The staff could'nt do enough for us and kept saying \" Welcome Back\". They had been hit hard by the flu epidemic and Americans' consequent reluctance to travel to Mexico. The property itself is beautiful as is the beach. The 24 hour room service is great and provided at no additional charge but the menu is a bit limited. The entertainment staff worked from 10am until close to midnight with energy and enthusiasm. There was a show each night. Of the seven shows there were only 2 that were duds. The mariachi band appeared bored stiff. \"Grease\" which was \"Vaselina\" in spanish was cancelled and the fill in show, a musical trivia game was no good. But, the rest were great, with the Michael Jackson tribute show a standout. There are 3 buffets,one that opens for breakfast through about 11am, then another for lunch until 5 and then the dinner. The food was great! Additionally, there are 5 themed restaurants, Mexican, Japanese, Brazilian, Steakhouse, and Fusion Gourmet. You have to stand in line to make reservations from 12 to 3p for these specialty restaurants and cannot make reservations for more than 2 days in advance which is kind of a pain. We ate in all except the Steakhouse because it was the only one that was not air conditioned. We liked them all except the Brazilian; it was all meats and the service was substandard. The staff at the Mexican restaurant made a big deal out of my birthday and it was great fun. We went back to the Fusion Gourmet because that was a favorite. We traveled down the beach to the Riu Playacar for lunch and there is no comparison. That hotel is depressing, the beach is ugly and the food was horrible. The weather was very hot and VERY humid. Bathing suits didn't dry overnight so bring two. Also, as mentioned on a previous review, a thermal mug is great at the pool because everything melts so quickly. You get a towel card that you turn in at the pool for a nice big towel. If you get the right person at the front desk, you can get another card. We took 2 excursions. One was a snorkling trip on a catamaran. The boat was full which, when snorkling was a negative and there were very few fish. But reef was beautiful and the staff was great; they even put on a little show which was lots of fun. The food was good. We also went on a \"Swim with the Dolphins\" excursion with Dolphin Discovery that I would not recommend. We got a \"bonus\" swim with the manatees which was in a small, dirty pool that made me sad for the animals. The dolphin swim was in a lagoon, slightly better than the manatee pool but all about the photos, do this, pose this way etc. with a sales pitch following. There was very little education about the dolphins and, again, I felt sorry for these beautiful creatures.

Once again we were very pleased with our decision to stay here. The price was right at the time we booked. We ate at most of the restaurants and the food was outstanding, including the breakfast and dinner buffet. Just because it's called a buffet doesn't mean the food can't be good. There are so many varities of food at the buffet it's mind blowing. We never had a bad meal. Drinks were perfect and the service was outstanding. Remember to bring some one dollar bills and tip your servers. Although it is not necessary to tip, the staff appreciates it and they will remember you the next day on the beach or the next night at dinner and they will make sure that your glass is never empty. If you want top shelf booze or top shelf tequila...just ask. Room service is great whether it's coffee in the morning, more towels, a bottle of wine, etc. All you have to do is pick up the phone and request what you need and it shows up at your door in no longer than 15 minutes time. I don't understand the poor reviews that people give this resort and I must be lead to believe that these people have stayed at very high dollar resorts in the past where they are spoon fed everything. Yes, there is a slight smell in the rooms, but remember the A/C is running 24/7 and the outside temperature is 92 degrees with high humidity. Nothing ever completely dries in these humid conditions. We brought a small scented candle for the room. We used Cancun Express for our transportation to and from the hotel with no problems. Our incoming flight was delayed due to some minor repairs and Cancun Express was still there waiting for us. You can go to their website by Googling \"Cancun Express\" and book/pay online using a credit card. They utilize PayPal so it's secure and safe. $115.00 roundtrip is not a bad price for piece of mind, plus you don't have to wait for other travelers to arrive before you are driven to your resort and additionally you don't have to wait for countless numbers of people to be dropped off at the different resorts enroute to yours. This is the best Riu in the area and remember you can visit/drink at the others when you stay at the RPRM. Try to get a room closer to the beach/pool area. We have stayed in 2104 and 2114 which offers a great view of everything including the ocean. One more thing.....you can go snorkeling, scuba diving, parasailing, jet skiing, etc. from the resort beach. The beat picks you up right on the beach so you don't have to pile in on some huge bus with 75 other people and drive an hour to a reef. If you're lucky you may even spot the resort cat and his close buddy, \"The Rat\". We fed the two fruit and granola bars every morning. We've never seen a rat and a cat play and interact with one another, but I guess anything goes in Mexico!

We think this is a fabulous resort and didn't really have any complaints about it. Coming from the UK, the temperature in June was probably a little warm for us but the a/c in the rooms and public areas was excellent and there was usually a nice breeze down at the beach. Apparently it's a bit cooler in the winter months so other Brits may want to consider going then instead. The food and service were excellent at all restaurants. Our favourites were Krystal and the Japanese - they were exceptional. We didn't use the buffet restaurant until the second last night but it was much better than we thought it was going to be so we would probably use it more often if we return. The waiting staff were all very attentive and we were never long without a drink - this went for the bars as well. The organised entertainment was generally good and lasted until 11pm. This was usually late enough for us as the heat seemed to tire us out a bit. There were plenty of bars in Playa del Carmen opening to 2 - 4am if you wanted to stay out later. Bodeguita del Medio was a good night out with live Cuban bands and salsa dancing lessons. The golf course across the road is excellent if a bit difficult. It's carved out of the jungle and there are plenty of lakes so you may lose a few balls on the way round. We paid about \u00a380 for an afternoon round which I thought was great value as it included buggy, clubs, balls and free food and drinks before, during and after the round.

My honeymoon at Riu Palace Riviera Maya was absolutely wonderful! My husband and I were going to go to Excellence Riviera Cancun for $3000, but when the swine flu hit, the rates for RPRM were unbeatable for the quality. We paid around $2700 through expedia.com for the best room at RPRM (the jacuzzi suite with ocean view). The hotel, room, food, service, and entertainment were all great. The hotel grounds were immaculate as many have noted, and all of the staff was friendly. When we walked into our room, it was a bit damp from the humidity, but it was not a big deal for us. The room had a king size bed (bed was extremely firm), jacuzzi, walk in shower, sitting area, toilet and bidet room, 1st floor balcony, and a spiral staircase that led to the hot tub on the second floor. Our room definitely made our honeymoon special, but we would still return to RPRM if we had a standard room. The food was delicious at Riu Palace Riviera Maya. My husband is very picky, and he thought the food was great, especially their steaks. Neither one of us got sick from food. The buffet was very good as well at Chili's and Don Manolo. I tried everything, and it all was delicious. We failed to pay attention and assumed Don Manolo a specialty restaurant but it was actually a buffet. So we spent most of our honeymoon thinking Chili's by the pool was the only buffet. The Agave, Chili's, and Krystal were the specialty restaurants we had reserved. All were great in their own way. The entertainment was good, but my husband and I were more of the lounge/relax vacationers so we didn't take advantage of all the options. We mainly went to the shows at night, and Las Vegas was the best show. I would highly recommend making that show. One night we walked to Playa del Carmen which is about a 15 minute walk and went through all of the stores. We took a $5 cab back. We also did an Alltournative tour to the cenotes and zip lines. It was 1/2 day and I am glad we didn't do all day. It's a great tour, but we were ready to be back at the resort towards the afternoon hours. Keep in mind that RPRM has a store on the ground floor where the parking is that offers medicine and other products for your needs. We ended up walking to another store to get some stuff that was already offered at RPRM at the same price or less. Overall, our trip to Playa del Carmen was fantastic. I would like to explore other all-inclusives just out of curiosity, but my husband said he wouldn't want to risk getting a lesser quality all-inclusive than the RPRM so he would want to stick with RPRM. We both loved it and would recommend this resort to anyone. We have to make a shout out to the pool bartender, Enrique, he was the best and made our trip great as well.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cRiu is definitely no 5-star resort --\u201d", "Author": "Bigdog", "ReviewID": "UR34426776", "Content": "This is a rather long, detailed review of the resort, but since we use Trip Advisor regularly in planning our vacations, we thought it was only fair to provide our detailed review for others. This was our first stay at a RIU, but our 6th time at an all-inclusive resort in Mexico. The first 4 times in Mexico, we stayed at an adults-only all-inclusive resort, and the last 2 times (including this visit), we had our infant daughter with us. We have found it difficult to find a resort of the class of Royal Hideaway or The Royal (which are adults only) in a resort that allows children, but we thought with the prior reviews of the Riu Palace Riviera Maya perhaps we would find the same 5-star quality at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya resort. We were wrong. The entrance to the hotel is very impressive, as is the lobby area. It is indeed very pretty and your initial impression is that you have made the right selection in a resort hotel. That impression can quickly change. We booked our trip through Apple Vacations. We had wanted to book the Suite, but Apple advised that they could only book the Junior Suite or the Superior Junior Suite, but that if we booked the Superior Junior Suite, it would not be any problem once we arrived at the hotel to upgrade the room to the Suite, paying the differential as shown on the Riu Palace Resorts website -- which showed approximately $350 difference for the entire 7 nights between the Superior Junior Suite and the Master Suite. So at check-in we requested the upgrade and offered to pay that differential, only to be told that we would be charged not $350 for the entire week as shown on their website, but $150 per night for each of 7 nights, meaning a differential of $1,050. When I questioned this further, I was told that the reason that they would charge more than advertised on their own website was because we booked through Apple and not through Riu itself, so they could charge whatever they wanted. We were certainly not willing to pay an additional $1,050 on this basis. So we went to the junior suite room assigned, which was rather small, considering we had to include a crib in the room. When we advised the front desk that we paid for the upgrade to the Superior Junior Suite, we were told that simply meant that you face the courtyard rather than the buildings on either side of the hotel, and there was absolutely no difference in the room. At check-in we were given 2 towel cards to be used daily to retrieve towels for the pool/beach area. When we presented them at the towel booth by the pool, and asked for a towel for our infant to use when coming out of the pool, we were refused a towel for her, and the person at the towel station was very rude about the situation, even though he could see me holding my daughter right in front of him. Another guest who heard this suggested that we go back to the front desk to request a 3rd card so as not to experience this problem once again. Why did the front desk not give us the 3rd card to begin with, since our daughter was at check-in with us and they were providing a crib for her so obviously were aware of her occupancy at the resort? At lunch in the buffet the first day, we requested a highchair for our daughter. When it was given to us, we looked in the seat to find it filthy, with leftover food. We checked 4 additional highchairs, and found the seats in each of them in the same dirty condition. The staff in the restaurant looked at each one and agreed that they were dirty and so went to get a towel to clean one of them for our daughter to use. We reported this to the front desk and asked for the high chairs to be cleaned before presenting them to a guest for their child to sit in. Following dinner that first evening, we returned to the room since we were very tired from the trip and had an infant with us who needed to go to sleep. Only upon returning to the room we found there was no electricity at all working in the room (no fan, no airconditioning, no lights), and the room was located directly behind the plaza where live music is playing until 11 p.m., not allowing our infant to sleep (since our infant was certainly with us upon check-in, the front desk should have taken the location of the room into consideration when initially assigning the room, but clearly did not). We called the front desk, and they sent maintenance to fix the electrical problem, only the repair person discovered a short in the fan which continued to cause the electricity to go out, and so went to locate a part and replace it which took about an hour, during which time we sat there with no lights or air conditioning. We also then had a plumbing problem in the bathroom, and called the front desk for repair once again. After complaining to the front desk, and asking for some accommodation, we were told we could move down the hallway about 10 rooms, but when I requested a possible upgrade to the suite as originally requested, I was flatly refused any type of upgrade. After what we had experienced with the filthy highchair, the loss of electricity, no air conditioning, plumbing problems, and the towel issue, that is the least that Riu Hotels could have done, but they refused (and considering the resort may have been 65%-70% occupancy, they could have made that accommodation). The following morning we met a travel agent/guest in the lobby and told her of the problems we were having at this resort (after all, she brings many guests to the Riviera Maya area), and she (although a total stranger) offered to assist us by asking the front desk to switch us to her room as she was checking out within a half hour, and her room was located at the end of the resort, the furthest from the music at night. The front desk said we could not have her room, but offered us another room close by in location, which at least solved the issue of the music keeping our infant awake at night. The location was indeed much better, but still no accommodation made by the hotel as a result of the first night with no electricity and plumbing problems, the filthy highchairs in the buffet, and the refusal of a towel for our daughter. The front desk advised us to talk to the Apple Vacations representative, and the Apple Vacations representative said that they could do nothing as it was the hotel making the decisions regarding our accommodations. Location - The resort is conveniently to downtown Playa del Carmen (5th Avenue), and is about a 20 minute walk from the hotel to 5th Avenue. If you prefer, you can spend $5 and take a taxi into town. Pool - There were plenty of chairs around the pool, but there should be since the hotel was far from full occupancy. However, at least 6 of the chairs we looked at to use by the pool were broken and unusable. But the 7 days we were there, no one removed them or replaced them with working chairs. The pool itself is not kept clean at all. It does not appear that they use any chlorine, and so the pool continually looks scummy and full of sunscreen. and there are dead bugs floating on the water as well as pieces from the trees which fall into the water, with no attempt to clean the pool regularly. The walking surface around the pool area is extremely hot, so you have to wear your shoes to walk even from your chair near the pool to the steps to enter the pool. Not good planning in the design of the resort. The pool hours end at 8:00 p.m., but when we went to return our towels to the towel booth at 6:30p.m. to retrieve our towel cards for the next day, the booth was closed. So you have to carry your wet towels to your room to hold for return the next day. If the pool is open until 8:00 p.m., why would they close the towel booth at 6:30 p.m.? Beach - The beach is very wide, and has plenty of chairs. The water was beautiful and fairly calm the entire stay. Food - The buffet gets tiring every day. We did try the Brazilian, Chili's Steakhouse, Mexican and Krystal restaurants for dinners. The food is \"okay\" at each of these speciality restaurants, but far from spectacular and not 5-star as we have had at other specialty restaurants in the resorts in the area. We did not try the Japanese restaurant. Given that the place is not fully occupied, they are closing one of the specialty restaurants each day, so it makes it even harder to get reservations for these restaurants than normal. In addition, the prior write-ups which describe how you have to leave the beach or plan your day so you can get in line in the piano bar area between Noon and 3:00 to make dinner reservations at a specialty restaurant are correct. And you can only make reservations for 2 days at a time, so you have to repeat this process several times in a week's stay. This is a crazy system for getting restaurant reservations. Otherwise, if you choose not to stand in line, you can eat at the buffet 3 times a day every single day, which quickly becomes repetitive and boring. They change the decor daily in the buffet for that day's \"theme\", but the food itself changes very little. Personnel - The waiters and waitresses and very nice, and work very hard. They were all very kind to our daughter as well, and we showed our appreciation to them by providing tips. The front desk personnel, however, could use some lessons in public relations. Room cleaning -- It appears that they clean the rooms needed for incoming guests in the morning, and so get to the existing guests' rooms late in the day. Our room was typically not cleaned until late afternoon, which meant if you came in from the pool to clean up for lunch, you had no clean towels to use. And again, when we first got into our room, there was ONE bath towel for 2 adults and one child. We had to call for more towels almost every day, or go down the hall to find the cleaning people and try to get the towels ourselves. We had asked for extra pillows the first day, and did receive them, only to have them remove one of the pillows for no reason when cleaning the room one day and never replacing it. And of the 7 nights we stayed there, turndown service was provided exactly ONCE, and used towels replaced. Which means that 6 of the 7 nights we were left with the same used towels from the evening to use in the morning until the room was finally cleaned late in the day. Turndown service and clean towels were provided each evening at every other resort in this area we have stayed at previously. WI-FI - At every resort we have stayed in previously, WI-FI is available in every guest room (you may or may not have to pay a charge for connection, but it is always available). Not here. If you need to use WI-FI, then you need to carry your laptop to the lobby, and sit in front of the reception desk to try to get to the \"hot spot\". And the connection is not always good. Otherwise you can go into the sports bar and pay to use one of their computers. In today's world, this lack of availability of WI-FI in guest rooms is unheard of and especially in a resort which is 3 years old. We will definitely consider a different resort (and not a RIU hotel) on our next trip to this area.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Dakota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!

We have Never had any problems with this company and we always book our excursions through them. Our first visit to Riu Palace. Check in was a breeze. I mentioned to the front desk that we were on vacation to celebrate our daughter's 18th birthday. Within 2 hours of check in, she received a birthday card and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room! Wow, impressive! I also emailed Diana/Public Relations director for the hotel a week before asking if the hotel could do something a little extra for our daughter's birthday. She did email me back and told me to connect with her upon arrival; which I did. She made dinner reservations for us for the night of her birthday. Our room was decorated on the day of her birthday with streamers, balloons and a \"towel \"cake with rose petals sprinkled on it. The steakhouse had a special table (decorated) waiting for us and the waiters sang Happy Birthday to her and brought out a cake! In summary, very impressed with the attention to detail and...at no extra charge! Overall service was excellent. The hotel did not seem to have a very high occupancy level during our stay. We never had to wait for table, plenty of room by the pool, etc. Room was very clean and we had no security/safety issues what so ever at the hotel. There was a wedding on property while we were there. It was on Friday late afternoon on the beach. Absolutely beautiful! What a great idea! Out of all the all inclusive resorts we have stayed, we found this location to have the best pool area! Spacious, plenty of room, mini tables in the pool along with pool loungers. There is also a swim up bar and an infinity pool. Only complaints -- gym is small. Only 2 treadmills and an eliptical. No free weights. There were people waiting for it to open up in the mornings so we opted to walk on the beach because we could not get on a machine.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201c2nd visit to RPRM - still highly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "JBizzle76", "ReviewID": "UR33967701", "Content": "My wife and I visited RPRM for the second time. We booked through Expedia for 3 nights, Jul 2 through Jul 5. Overall, we were very pleased. We went in May 08 for a week and decided to go back now for a couple of days away over the July 4th weekend. We were very impressed with the resort last year and remain impressed with it today. We were in 3165 which is directly above the front desk. It is one of the few rooms that faces the ocean. The food is actually very good. I read many complaints on Tripadvisor, but we found the food (at both the buffets and at reserved dinners) to be consistent and very good. This is an all-inclusive resort and not a 5 star restaurant, so keep your expectations in check and you wont be disappointed! Besides, if you ever want higher quality food, downtown Playa is a 10 minute walk and filled with restaurants. The Playacar complex is an excellent place to be. We recommend you hire a private transportation company to take you NON-STOP directly from Cancun airport to the resort. We used Playa.info to book transportation and would do it again. Excellent communication, drivers friendly, on-time, even offered to stop on the way to the hotel for food/beer/etc. :) RPRM is about 1 hour south of the airport. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff at this resort. They really go all out to make sure you are happy. At the pool bar, I asked for one beer, and the bartender just makes two. The beach is excellent. The pool is excellent. Get a RIU Class membership - it gives you discounted water activities (25%) and doubles the amount of time you have on the business center computers. We did venture offsite a couple of times. Once to XCARET. It was well worth the $99 per person and just 5 minute taxi ride south of the hotel. Another couple of times we went to downtown Playa for shopping and drinks. Highly recommended. Take a taxi because it is hot - even at midnight. We'll go back - it will be hard not to just book the Riu Palace Riviera Maya.

My first visit in June 2006 for my honeymoon was great. We decided to return for our three anniversay with the same expectations, and even choose to stay 4 more nights. Our reservations were made in February, before the health scare, so we paid close to $4000.00. Our travel agent notified the Riu Palacce that we were return guest celebrating an anniversary and requested an upgrade or at least the same kind of accommodations that we had our first stay. When we checked-in we asked about the upgrade and was just said no! No explanation(you would think with all the folks deciding to not go to Mexico, that they would be glad we still keep or reservations). We were give a smaller suite than what we thought we had paid for, the ac didn't work well and it was above the nightly activity center(which can be noisy very late). No view of anything! After two days we were moved to the suite we should have had in the beginning. But this was only after complaining about the ac. After one day in the new one, money was taken out of my billfold in a locked safe! We made a report, and basically was told that no one could get in the safe. (I'm sure they have way to get in after a guest leaves and they close the safe!) I ended up with food poisioning on the 4th day and found out that several other visitors also had done so. On the second to the last day there, we had made reservations for dinner, we were seated and already give our drink when we were asked to leave because they had made a scheduling error--the restaurant was scheduled for a wedding group(you would think they knew that ahead of time). So we were left to do the buffet all dressed up!! The positive that I can say is the food prep folks/bartenders/waiters and cleaning people work really hard, long hours to keep the guest happy. The Palace is a pretty place, it has gone down alittle in the last three years though. I'm sure it's a huge up-keep. Upon leaving we were told that the management was investigating the safe issue--asked for my email and told they would get back to me. Still waiting!

I can honestly say this is the best resort I have ever been to. The resort is located in Playacar which is a resort area just south of Playa Del Carmen. It was about a 1 hour drive from the airport. We used private transportation from cancuntransfers.com which was great. I'd recommend them to anyone traveling to or from the Cancun airport. When our driver dropped us off at the main entrance we were very pleased with our choice. You enter the front lobby to the sight of fresh lilies, large crystal chandeliers, marble floors, and a wall of windows that allowed people to sit at the lobby bar and look out onto the courtyard area and the Caribbean Sea. Check-in was smooth and quick. When we arrived at our room it was still being cleaned, which wasn't a big deal. The bellhop just placed our luggage in the closet and told us that they would be finished in about 30 minutes. Just enough time to walk around and enjoy this wonderful resort. I was truly impressed with the courtyard which had lovely fountains leading the way towards the pool areas and beach. BEACH: The beach area is divided into two different sections. The area next to the ocean is a public area where you'll be offered many different excursions like parasailing, waverunners, fishing, boating, snorkeling, scuba diving, etc. The upper beach area is on the resort property and the only think you'll be offered here is a nice cold drink. The upper part had lots of beautiful palm trees that could be used as protection from the hot tropical sun. Yes there are sandbags in the water, but they provide protection for lesser swimmers and children. The bags even added a little character to the ocean. They are starting to look like rocks instead of sand bags. If you want to swim in deeper water there is plenty of space past the bags where you can swim in deeper water which was always uncrowded. POOLS: The pools were very nice. We didn't spend too much time in them because we're more beach people. We never had a problem getting a lounger by the pool, if we wanted one. There is an infinity pool which is about 6 feet above the main pool. One of the only complaints I have about the resort is that the pool bar closes at 6 pm and both pools close at 8 pm. We would have spent more time in the pools if they permitted swimming in the evening. The reason they closed the pools early were that they cleaned them each night. Still it would have been nice to swim a little at night. RESTAURANTS: There are plenty of dining options at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. The buffet was good, lots of options and choices. We only ate there one night, but it was very good. We did eat breakfast at the buffet twice. It too was good. Anything you'd want to have for breakfast was available. Our second night we dined at the Japanese restaurant, it was good also. It is not a Japanese grill like many are used to in America. I thought meal was very good. Remember, you're in Mexico not Japan! The Brazilian restaurant was our least favorite. The food was good, but just not our cup of tea. Chili's, the steakhouse, was great. We ate there the third and sixth night of our stay. The setting is outdoors just off the beach where you can see the very blue Caribbean Sea and beautiful palms. We had the steak and lobster each time and were pleased both times we dined there. Our fifth night we dined at Agave, the Mexican restaurant and this was our second favorite, just behind the Chili's. We could not complain about any of the food we ate at the resort, it was all very good. ROOMS: I did not find the bed hard or uncomfortable. I was curious as to the previous guest\u2019s reviews saying that the beds were rock hard. This is not true. Yes, they are firm but it's good for the back to sleep on a firm surface. Our room had a lovely balcony that overlooked the courtyard. The bathroom was marble, had two sinks, a bath with jets, and shower. The room was cleaned daily and smelled clean, not musty, each time we entered it. STAFF / SERVICE: This is where I was truly impressed. The workers at this resort go above and beyond the call of duty. Anything you want or need, they will get for you. Anytime you need a drink, someone is there to serve you with a smile. Someone was cleaning something all the time. Workers were pleased to serve, which isn't the case very often in the US. I loved the service and I tipped them each time I was served. I was very surprised at the number of people that didn't tip. If the service would have been bad or slow, I probably wouldn't have tipped either, but I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I didn't tip them, knowing the efforts the staff goes to in order to make your stay special. I got to know several of the bartenders and servers, Santos, Javier, Martin, Marvin, Jose, John William, all did their best to make you feel like you were the most important guest at the resort. Thank you. I have no idea how this resort is rated #17. It should be, without question, number one. The only people that complain about this resort are the type of people that find something to complain about all the time. They are the ones that try to get something for free and don't, so they write bad reviews. I could find nothing at all to complain about at all, other than the pool closing early. My wife and I both loved the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. We took a walk to the other Riu resorts in Playacar and they don't even come close to the Riviera Maya. The Palace Mexico is nice, but the pool is much smaller. If you want true luxury then the Palace Riviera Maya is the only choice. I'd stay here again in an instant. I can't wait to go back. If you have any questions about this resort please feel free to IM me. Thank you very much Riu Palace Riviera Maya for making our vacation perfect. We'll be back soon.

The room was AWESOME, however we had the jacuzzi suite. We had two floors/balconies...our top floor was the second jacuzzi and we could see the pool and ocean from it.

Coco Beach also has an area to snorkel as well as kiteboarding if you are interested. 5th avenue is a short walk down (1 mile) the street with a ton of shopping and things to do like ferry to cozumel and sky diving. We never felt unsafe here and we walked a lot outside of the resort. We even took a cab ride to the outdoor cenotes about 20 minutes south and jumped/snorkeled there.

The facility and grounds are beautiful. We paid an additional fee for a full suite. Per the hotel's website, the room was to have a courtyard or ocean view. That which we received was a beautiful view of the buffet restaurant's (Chili's) roof (see photo). A bit of the ocean can be seen beyond the roof. The room itself was very nice. The bed, as described by many other guests, was rock hard and very uncomfortable. Housekeeping didn't clean our room until 3-4pm each day; so we always returned to our room after lunch or swimming to find it as messy as we left it that morning. Also, as many other guests have posted, the rooms and the hotel in general, smells musty/humid/smoky/sour. Our clothes and luggage reeked of the stench when we returned home. I realize that the hotel is in a tropical area, but there is no excuse for this kind of stink. The room's air conditioning was at best minimally effective. The downfall of the facility is its food and drink. Stick to the beer and wine. The hotel uses the lowest level of liquor available. Combine the cheap liquor with the cheapest mixers and the result is acidic pina coladas, bitter margueritas, and horrid daquiris. The food was right on par with the drinks. Conceptually, the food was great. But, when you take a great culinary concept and ask a minimally trained and low paid staff to execute the recipe, the results are laughable. Among the dining options is the Japanese venue, \"Yashima\". Each meal begins with a preconfigured plate of \"sushi\". Riu takes the word \"precongigured\" to the extreme. The plate and its contents was served refrigerator cold. The sushi was assembled by somebody possessing an iron grip as each roll and mound of rice was as solid and heavy as a brick. We ate no more than a half-bite and left the balance for the trash can. The next course was an assortment of fried items that was supposed to be Tempura. Again, the concept was great while the execution was a disaster. The coating was wet, heavy, greasy, and totally inedible. My entree was supposed to be some sort of a shrimp stir-fry. I received 6-7 small shrimp in a nasty/sweet sauce that tasted as though it came from a can. All of the dishes are served with rice that's sprinkled with an odd mixture of seeds and herbs. It's very off-putting. For dessert I ordered a banana egg-roll. I received a burned assembly of black bananas. Again, totally inedible. We also \"dined\" in Krystal and Agave, their \"fine dining\" and Mexican themed restaurants. Put into context, Krystal was their best venue. But, let me be clear, if I received the food served at Krystal, in any other US based \"fine dining\" restaurant, I would have ran for the door. The most offending dish was their molten chocolate cake. It was actually a rock-hard muffin with a warm blob of frosting dropped into the middle. The muffin was so dense and heavy that it remained uneaten. The buffet restaurants made up for lacking quality with quantity and variety. Bottom line-- would I return?

United canceled our flights 2 weeks after we booked. Then when Sam's Travel re-booked us with Frontier (thanks Frontier) they accidentally canceled our hotel reservation. We finally got our hotel back....but, we were originally supposed to stay at the RPM, and got transferred last minute to RPRM because of lack of visitors. This ended up being a blessing in disguise. All along people said RPM is for beach people and RPRM is for pool people. After this trip we realized we are pool people and out of the 2 palaces RPRM was the best option for us. We are an active mid 30's couple. That being said...we made it to Cancun safely and were shortly on our way to the resort on a Best Day shuttle, which I would recommend. Check in was easy. We told them this was our 5th RIU and we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary, so they upgraded us to a top floor fountain view room free. We hit the pool bar 5 minutes after we were there. Then we decided to walk the beach down to the other RIU resorts. That took about 15 minutes. We decided if you're on a budget...the Yucatan or Tequila would be great. Fun and tropical...but apples and oranges when comparing to a palace. They're more tropical....a palace is a palace. We were treated like royalty. It had been awhile since we had been to a palace. But, you definitely notice the service. We had turn down service, excellent dining staff and pool bartenders. The staff decorated our room the night of anniversary with petals, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. They even lined up our shoes when they cleaned the room. For those of you wondering... here's my comparison of RPRM to the RPM. RPM opened 2 days after we were there. We did check it and its rooms out so I could have an educated opinion for future trips. *RPRM is newer and has a better pool, especially if you like pool volleyball. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to downtown Playa...which we loved. Men can wear shorts to dinner at the buffet. I think the beach is plenty big. *RPM is older and has more character. I also like the layout of the rooms better. The bathrooms have separate commodes with bidets and a hallway separating the bathroom from the bed. The gym is better at this one....free weights and air conditioning that works. Men must wear pants at night...no matter what. The beach is about twice as big and has a beach bar. But, if you want to walk to Playa it's going to a be a hike...I'd say almost a half hour. It is right next door to RIU Yucatan and Tequila...which are fun to visit especially at night because they have outdoor bars. Their pools are also fabulous and you can use them. *So, if I went back which would I choose? Probably RPRM again. RPM needs to update its pool and we spent a lot of time at the pool. Plus we enjoyed the walks at night to the other resorts. It gave me another reason to eat dessert because I knew I'd walk it off. If we stayed at RPM we would have taken a cab to downtown. I enjoyed walking. (FYI-RIU Palace Las Americas in Cancun is the nicest RIU we've been to) OK Back to RPRM *ROOM- everyone gets a Jr. Suite unless you upgrade. Flat-screen tv, living room, pretty hard bed, but you're usually too exhausted to care. I brought a LED taplight for the shower which I heard was dark. It did help light it up a bit. We did see one of those Jacuzzi Suites on the corner and they are fabulous if you can afford the upgrade. Jacuzzi in your room and outside up a spiral staircase. *POOL-fabulous! We played pool volleyball almost every afternoon. It's a great way to meet people and cool off. We never had a problem finding a chair to throw our stuff. Waiters bring you drinks. *BEACH-great...sand is super soft and won't burn your feet. They also have hammocks. *FOOD- We have been to other Rius and did the sit down restaurants. They are good. But, we decided we didn't want to be on a schedule and since the buffets had so much to offer..we stuck with them. Caribbean night was the best..lots of shrimp. Every night there is a special station with a chef. I had a create your own pasta several times that rivaled the Cheesecake Factory. We also had fresh crepes and fried bananas. We had French toast and pancakes every morning. It depends on who's making them, because some days they were out of this world...other days they were just good. We took a time share tour to another all-inclusive. We had lunch and the food was a little better...but, just barely. We are not picky and we are always happy with RIU food. I say it's always good, sometimes great...but, never bad. If you don't like something...get something else. We got room service and were pleasantly surprised. It arrived within 5 minutes and he even brought me a rose. We got the chicken toasties, a sandwich and fruit..mmmm. You can also grab fruit or sandwiches 24/7 at the sports bar for a late night snack. Despite all the food and drinks...I only gained 2lbs....thanks to all the walking and always using the stairs at the resort! *ENTERTAINMENT-We watched Grease (a little cheesy) and Michael Jackson (great). But, we spent the rest of our evenings walking downtown. RPRM didn't have any audience participation entertainment while we were there. That's my favorite...\"the Newlywed Game, Miss Riu, or Mr. Riu\" It's a hoot. Maybe they did it the following week or at one of the other resorts????? *EXCURSIONS...I got a tip from the trip advisor forums to go to Akumal and snorkel. Best thing we did! We took a cab to the downtown collectivo station. ($5) Then we took the collectivo, a van, to Akumal ($5 roundtrip). A cab to Akumal would cost $50 roundtrip...so it's well worth taking the collectivo. It dropped us off on the highway, but we just started walking toward the water which took about 10 minutes. We waded in and found turtles 5 minutes after we started snorkeling. We have our own gear. But, I understand you can rent it at the dive shop there. We also took the ferry to Cozumel and went on a glass bottom boat/snorkel ling trip. It was ok. But, I thought they would take us further out on the reefs. We were very close to shore for each of the 3 reefs we visited. You could probably do that by yourself as well. Just look where the tour boats are. We rented a scooter and rode around the island. WOW..that's a long ride...probably 2 hours. I recommend a jeep or dune buggy instead of a scooter. We only spent $20, though. We also decided to rent bicycles at RIU Tequila. But, as we were walking to the resort we saw bikes at the Playacar Shopping Plaza halfway there. Get this....the Mexican Government is encouraging \"going green\" so it supplied bicycles free of charge. You just need to leave a deposit. We rode around Playacar. But, if we did it again....we would take the bikes on the Cozumel ferry and ride around Cozumel. We loved walking to 5th Ave. I wish we would have had dinner down there one night. It's like a flea market that turns into NYC's Greenwich Village. *What I would change.....**very minor** Pool bar needs to be open longer. They start closing around 5pm. We got back from Cozumel around 5:45 and were dying to hit the pool with a drink. We were a little disappointed. I can't believe I'm saying this...but, I wish they served breakfast earlier, too. It's at 7am and I like to get up early on vacation so I can get in more activities for the day. I wish RIU's had coke products instead of Pepsi. The gym could use free weights. (but you can always walk down to RPM and use its gym) Neither palace has an outdoor bar. Every other RIU we've been to has one and it's great in the evening. We are not heavy drinkers, but we enjoy the social aspect. But, again.... that's another reason to take a walk and check out Yucatan or Tequila which have them. Overall...this was one of our best vacations! We love RIU's and we would definitely go back to RPRM. The staff couldn't have been nicer.

Changed our bills, were approached only once by a timeshare rep, politely declined, went our way to Lomas out the door. The Lomas people, there were at least a dozen of them, were very helpful.

Our room was 2053, great view of the property and ocean. Comfortable bed, plenty of space for two. The bathroom was not up to par with the rest of the room. It was dark, dingy and needed some caulk work. The tub was nice and big, but looked so dingy that I didn't dare take a bath. Mini bar was a nice touch, although we didn't partake in any of the liquor, but did have a few beers and plenty of water. The room was cleaned nicely, some times twice daily. We had some towel animals. We did tip the maid (was a guy...what do you call a guy maid??) and a couple times we left a buck or two for the minibar lady (for special requests). The room had an electronic safe. No issues with that. Worked well. Nice flat screen tv, too. The beach was beautiful, water was a bit choppy the first few days, but calmed down later in the week. The area of beach at the RPRM is the nicest in the vicinity. We checked. Great swimming, and good areas to play in the waves. Plenty of loungers at the beach AND by the pool and upper beach. The pools were big and fun. The pool bar was ok, but there were neat little areas off the bar where you could relax with your drink in the water. Very nice. Lots of lively pool volleyball being played. I thought there could have been at least one other bar that served the beach crowd. It was a drag to have to hike it up to the pool bar to get a drink. There was scarcely any drink service down at the beach. That is an area of improvement. Another area is the noise. When it was not very full, the hallways were nice and quiet, but the doors slammed a lot at night when it was fuller. I do think some people were just rude and slamming doors, but the issue is that the doors are very heavy and just slam closed if you don't ease it shut. May seem like a little thing, but on vacation, you don't like to be startled out of bed at 2 am by slamming doors. Drinks were plentiful and tasty. Beer is Dos Equis which is a favorite of my husband. I only drank beer, pina coladas, champagne and red wine, all the types they had, the merlot was dry, but the Mexican red was very smooth, as was the Chilean Cab. Oh, that's not true, I also had a few palomas (tequila and squirt...get the Don Julio!). Husband had beer, red wine and Cuba Libres (rum and coke). Champagne was very good. A Spanish Cava, forget the brand. Will look for it. Food was good. Buffet had many choices, but all started to blend towards the end of the week. I imagine it would be that way anywhere. We did eat off the resort a few nights for dinner or snacks. We ate at Los Carboncitos (Loved it! Great tacos al pastor, great service. Located just off of 5th ave.), La Caprichoza (Flambe, didn't realize it...they made my camarones a la diabla at the table! Awesome and tasty), and...our favorite place La Bodeguita del Medio (went there three times, twice for drinks-the BEST mojitos, and once for drinks and apps.). We visited the B del M in Puerto Vallarta and LOVED it. We were so excited to be able to come and visit another. We hope one day to visit the original in La Havana, Cuba. B del M is located right in the fancier shopping area at the start of 5th Ave when traveling north from the hotel. The shopping area is very nice. Hmmm...what else. The hotel was not at all crowded for the first 5 days, then BAM. Lots of people. You could tell at the buffets, but still had plenty of room at the beach and pools. More families than I expected. Seeing the kids made me miss my girls. I think we'll do adults only next time. I had been told that this wasn't really a family place, well, it is. There's nothing wrong with it, other than it made me miss my kids and didn't have the \"vibe\" I wanted. Also, this isn't a \"party\" place at all. It's all about relaxing and it caters to families. They have a very nice plaza area that can be lively at night depending on the live band that's playing. The Vegas night was the most fun. We stayed for the show which I thought was very good. The dancers were fantastic, and I am VERY CRITICAL. There's a kids club and a kids mini disco at night, which is cute at first, but after many nights, kind of annoying. Again, my fault for going to a family-oriented place. If you want to bring your kids, it's really great. We would bring our girls there in a heart beat! If you want a place where you can walk from your door right out to the beach, this is not the place for you. There's a bit of a walk as the resort is big and spread out. I liked the layout, but missed the closeness of the beach we had at El Dorado Royale. We walked into the town 3 afternoons. We were hot and sweaty, but enjoyed looking at the wildlife and the Mayan ruins on the way in. Not a bad walk at all. We even walked to WalMart (sunscreen!) one afternoon, but cabbed it back ($5). Some of the vendors on 5th are a bit much in the evenings. We went into town a few nights and were offered \"pipes\" and \"a little something to smoke\" a little too much, which irritated the heck out of my husband when they wouldn't get the hint and move on. They usually did when we replied in Spanish. Now, these aren't the hardworking folks in front of their stores, these are annoying dudes just hanging out around 5th trying to sell you pot and Lord knows what else. We are not uptight people, but it's just a bit much after a while and takes away from some of the enjoyment of strolling through town. We took a snorkeling trip with Scuba Caribe through the resort to Akumal and the Cenote Dos Ojos. We booked through Matais (very nice guy) and GJ (Super nice Dutch guy) was our guide. It was almost like a private tour. It was my husband, myself, Vin (a Dutch traveler) and GJ our guide. We had a blast. Akumal was great. We saw probably 6 turtles (amazing creatures!), squid, a few rays, a large barracuda and some assorted fish. Lovely area, would return for sure. Dos Ojos Cenotes were amazing, something out of a dream. If you are claustrophobic, use caution, you have to snorkel through a tight, dark area to get into the \"bat cave.\" The water is also very cool, but is refreshing after a while. I highly recommend GJ and this trip. I think it was $80 per person. We also get beverages and a sandwich, nothing fancy, but good enough. RPRM is very beautiful, in a great location and has wonderful service. I don't know, however, if we'll return. There are many other places on the Riviera to stay, and I feel we could have gotten a bit more for the $$$ especially since many of the guests were upgraded from other RIU properties which were closed due to the H1N1 hysteria and we were offered nothing in comparison like an upgrade or spa service, etc. I will say this, if you want to relax and enjoy the beautiful weather and surroundings, this is a great place to do it.

Flight: Continental cancelled flights so the planes were packed. Crying baby the whole flight to Mexico. We were the first ones through customs from our plane and we breezed through as no one else was there. Missed a half day of vacation because of Continental changing our flight from 3 p.m. to 12:15 coming back. Check in: We arrived about noon \u2013 way before the 3 p.m. check-in time but got our room immediately. Offered a cold drink right then. Room: upgraded to courtyard view, second floor room with large balcony near the pool/beach. There was a second door shutting our room and another off from the hall, which helped with the noise. We tipped daily and several evenings we got turn down service. Beach: saw lots of weddings on the beach. Whales in the water didn\u2019t bother us. Loved the hammocks and they had palm trees instead of umbrellas or palapas. Food: Ten days of buffets for breakfast and lunch got tiring. Lunch buffet was OK, nice variety. Fish, lamb, beef, etc. \u2013 not just hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza like some resorts(although those were offered). Often the lights didn\u2019t keep the food hot. Evening buffet very nice, good variety and excellent table service, cappuccino and brandy! No reservations were available the day we arrived. The special restaurants had a very limited menu \u2013 maybe 4 main courses and limited to two seating\u2019s: 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Our favorite restaurant was the Krystal and we ate there twice. We were unimpressed with Agave (the Mexican). We liked the sushi at Yokihama but the tempura was greasy and cold. Loved the seafood platter at the steakhouse (about the only time I got my smoked salmon). The only reservations available for the last Friday and Saturday were for the Brazilian and steakhouse @ 8:30 p.m. Hated having to decide a day or two in advance what time to eat \u2013 we prefer eating when we are hungry. General: Preferred the old piano bar at the Riu Palace Mexico better, more closed off and private, new one is too busy. The music at the pool included a few songs every day. I heard the \u201cchicken song\u201d and the \u201csi, si, si, no, no, no\u201d song multiple times a day. There were lots of activities hosted by the animation team. Hotel gave certificates and prizes (such as a Riu visor for winning (including dart tournament, air rifles, sexy bingo). I enjoyed the kitchen tour and Spanish lessons. The hotel charged $3.35 for a local phone call to Cancun Valet to confirm our private non-stop transportation to the airport. Because of the other Riu\u2019s being shut down, we missed being able to use their pools. Enjoyed the nightly shows and the drink service was excellent. For the money we spent, the Riu Palace Riviera Mexico was one of the best all-inclusive hotels we\u2019ve been to. It\u2019s not all adult and it doesn\u2019t offer a la cart restaurants without reservations, but you pay a lot more money for all-adult, all a la cart resorts. There is a big money difference to move up to all adult/all a la carte restaurants.", "Date": "June 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City", "Title": "\u201cSuper Awesome and Funny >Vacations\u201d", "Author": "Genamotion", "ReviewID": "UR31902776", "Content": "Hello!!!

We were with a group of 8 people and had no problems getting dinner reservations and rooms close together. We stayed from May 31-Jume 6. The grounds are immaculate and the employees are always eager to please. It is in a gated community which makes you feel very safe and secure. We never had any problems getting a chair by the pool or on the beach. Business still seemed a little slow due to the swine flu (which doesn't seem to exist in this part of the country). By the end of our stay it was picking up a little. The room is equipped with a hair dryer, iron and ironing board, There is also shower gel in a dispenser in the shower that worked quite well. The mini fridge is fully stocked with Pepsi products and Dos Equis beer. The fridge is restocked every 2 days. There is also various liquoer dispensers in the room. The drinks by the pool are served in tiny glasses so you may want to bring your own larger cup from home. They are happy to fill them for you. There is no drink service located on the beach which is a little bothersome. We took turns going to the pool bar to bring them back to the beach. We ate at every restaurant and the food was outstanding at each one. The lunch buffet was typical for an all inclusive resort. We had no trouble finding something edible. My one and only complaint was that the pool bar shut down at 6 pm each evening. We were never ready to go in. After 6 you have to go to the sports bar or the lobby bar to get a drink and they are both indoors. That was a real bummer as we were not finished enjoying drinks outside at the pool and on the beach. Aside from this, the resort was wonderful! We visited Tulum which is a nice trip that won't take up your whole day. We also visited Hidden Worlds for a day of adventure. I definitely recommend this to everyone.

Professional, friendly staff, accommodating, don't nickel and dime you. \"Everything is possible\" is their motto.

Reservations for restaurants had to be made in the lobby bar between 12:00-3:00 and could be made for a couple days in advance (although the brochure said only one day in advance). Chilis, which is near the pool had great rib-eye (which we ordered rare but came medium rare and was quite thin). The baked Alaska was great to watch being prepared but tasted only so-so. Botafogo, which is a \"Brazil\" type restaurant serves different types of meat on long skewers following a buffet salad bar with a pretty long line. It has a nice low-light ambiance and men are supposed to wear long pants and no sandals. The food was okay. These were the only two restaurants we tried because we were always gone during the day and couldn't make reservations for dinner. So we always ate at the buffet. You can eat inside (air conditioned) or outside. You can dress up or down. The buffet service was OUTSTANDING. We were seated immediately. There was always a different variety every night. They took our empty plate off the table immediately. They filled our empty glasses immediately. Buffets are never our favorites but this one was fantastic! We fixed sandwiches a couple times and took them to the beach and took ice cream up to our room a couple of nights. They also have room service. There is a refrigerator stocked with water, Pepsi, 7Up, Orange soda & Diet Pepsi in the room. There is a liquor dispenser above the mini-frig with full size bottles of Jose Cuervo Especial Tequila, Presidential Solera Brandy, Smirnoff Triple Distilled Vodka and Bacardi Superior Rum. No Coca-Cola products.They will also bring you other types of liquor if you ask. Our Junior Suite was on the fourth floor near the lobby with a small deck and a slight ocean view. We had a small sitting area with two chairs for watching TV. The air conditioning could have worked better and the toilet did not flush very well. The first night we got there, the jets in the tub did not work and I reported it. They fixed it the next day. The jets were not in very good locations though (two near my thighs, two near my ankles) so I didn't really use it much). My husband has a bi-pap machine for sleep apnea and must sleep with it at all times. Power was going to be shut off on one side of the hotel between 2-5 am so we told the front desk about his special needs. They happily moved us to the other side of the hotel for the night so we would have electricity for his machine. There is free high speed internet in the lobby, which isn't so high speed at times. The pool bar closes at 6:00 and the pool closes at 8:00, which we thought was way too early. The towel shack was closed almost every time we went there, but we went in the evenings, not mornings. The rooms over by the pool are pretty noisy starting around 7:00 am so if you're not an early riser get a room nearer the lobby. This hotel is a bit of a party place so if you have a problem with drinking and loud people, go somewhere else. We visited ruins at Tulum and Coba (we rented a car), we went to Akamul and snorkeled with sea turtles, we went scuba diving nearby and in a cenote (not for claustrophobics) with Scuba Libre (much better rates and service than those in the hotel or in front of the property). We checked out at 12:00 noon, stayed in the pool until 2:00, showered in the hotel (with hair dryer) and ate lunch at no additional charge. The black birds that live in the palm trees around the property are beautiful (though noisy) and really comical to watch.

We had the place to ourselves! The resort holds almost 500 people and there were only about 200, due to the cancellations from the non-existent flu. There have been no reported cases in the Playa area. I know that this a super positive review, but we travel 2-3 times a year to big resorts, and this was our best trip since Hawaii! The service was excellent from the moment we walked into the lobby. Everyone was so friendly and eager to fulfill our every request. If we asked for a bottle of wine to be sent to our room, it was there in minutes! The food was excellent at the buffets and were full of variety so we did not eat the same food at every meal. Yum! The staff was so helpful and always had a big smile for us. The specialty restaurants were very good too, especially Krystal. I liked that you could make reservations up to 4 days in advance, as some resorts will only do reservations for that day only. Even the deli, burgers, hotdogs at the sports bar were good in a pinch. The room service was prompt and delicious as well. The pool bar staff was great- Enrique was so fun! Make sure to be there for \"sexy\" bingo at 4pm, as it is a hoot! Also, make sure to order a \"dirty monkey\" a yummy banana, chocolate, frozen cocktail. Thomias at Scuba Caribe was very friendly and helpful with scheduling our diving and sailing and wave runnners. See Thomias at Scuba Caribe on the beach instead of the guys in the lobby of the resort for any water activities. As for the beach, it could not have been better. There were tons of chairs right next to the surf, and a huge palm tree shaded area for those who do not want fun sun. We spent most of our days under those gorgeous trees! And the beach was huge compared to some of the other resorts. The resort is a $5 short cab ride to Playa, which you must see for shopping.

We loved everything about the hotel; the lobby area is out of this world and if you take time to look around (and up at the ceiling) you see how much care has been taken on the detail of the decor and the excellent workmanship. We found the food to be excellent and the food selection in the main buffet restaurant was that good that we only ate in one of the speciality restaurants once. The service was first class, from guiding you to your table to making sure that your table was cleared and that drinks were replenished (do not understand earlier complaints of the service, but you always get one who will moan about everything). A special thank you to Niermas (apologies if spelled incorrectly) who made a special occcasion more special for my partners birthday and arranged for all the choir (waiters!!) to sing a birthday ditty. Also, the service around the pool and beach area was great and another special thank you to Joe who was everybody's best friend (and called all the ladies \"Princess\" - very sweet. The hotel was spotless, even before the drama of the swine flu. Cleaners were constantly around and the public areas were given much attention. We were given the option of leaving the hotel early when the flu first broke but we were happy to stay in the wornderful hotel for the duration of our holiday and we are now glad that we did. We cannot comment on the entertainment at night as we found it difficult to stay up that late!! A full day on the beach or by the pool and following dinner, it was difficult to stay awake until late, but that type of holiday suits us fine. A special mention for Pedro in the sports bar who remembered our drinks and was eager to keep everyone happy with their choice of viewing on the multiple TV's.

We truly loved the Mexican the best and went back more often than the other restaurants. We took the $5 cab ride into Playa del Carmen 3 times and had a ball every time! The smaller shopping area down the road in Playacar was also worth the trip and we got some great deals after negotiating. For those complaining about the entertainment, come on!

The staff at the pool bar were almost fighting over taking care of us so no more than 3-5 minutes went by without someone stopping to check on us. A few who stood out - Joe (okey dokey), Javier (with his incredible smile and great sense of humor) and Marvin! We stopped by the pool bar on our way to our room one afternoon and my husband asked for a few glasses of Jim Beam straight to mix cocktails in the room. Marvin told him to open his bag and he placed a full bottle in there! He was, of course, tipped very well for that! We were only there a short period of time and therefore didn't check out all of the restaurants. We had the buffet the first evening. We didn't like everything we tried but there was plenty to try and went back for seconds once we landed on what we did like.

We rarely waited for a drink and there was service staff everywhere, so we rarely had to even go up to the bar. There were even people walking around the pool taking orders and bringing trays out to the beach. Not to focus too much on the drinking, but the booze and beer was actually decent stuff as well. The beer was XX Lager (and cold) and there were name brand liquers. Often at an all inclusive you get imitation everything and that was not the case here. The food was very good. As is the case in any resort, the main restaurant was a buffet, but the atmosphere of the buffet restaurant was much nicer than most with cloth napkins, table drink service and very fast cleanup of extra dishes. There were a lot of different options. We also ate at several of the 'specialty' restaurants including the Brazilian, The Japanese, The Steakhouse, and the 'modern'. They were all very good and lent to a more quiet dinner style than the usual buffet. The only thing I didn't love was how close the tables were together at various places, but that is something that can't really be avoideded. The beach and pool were both great and there were so many chairs available, no matter what time we went out there, we were always able to get a seat at either place. There was also a lot of umbrellas available by the pool and palm trees on the beach, so you could always find shade if needed. Our room was very nice with a king bed and a separate sitting area. There is a stocked fridge and booze dispenser and if you run out of anything, they come immediately to replenish. They also had 24 hour room service which was a nice feature. Our rooms were cleaned very well every day including the floor being washed, which you don't always see and after time on the beach, it was appreciated. One day we forgot our safe open and the cleaning staff locked it for us and we had to get the front desk to open it. I thought this showed a lot of integrity as we had a lot of cash and our passports sitting there. They had shows each night which were ok, but if you want some real night life, you would have to head out of the resort. We were out to relax, so it didn't bother us. The only thing we needed to pay for was phone calls. There was a $4 charge per call to use the phone in your room even with a calling card.

We came in thru Cancun Airport during the height of the spring break season\u2014extremely busy. If you are traveling during Spring Break be prepared for a lot of long lines and bag checks\u2014very tiring after a 4hr flight. Right as we were about to exit the hotel to look for our transportation\u2014Olympus Tours\u2014there was a host of men wearing shirts stating, \u201cTourist Information.\u201d We were approached by one of them and they asked us what transportation are you looking? We replied, \u201cOlympus Tours and RPRM.\u201d He then stated that once you go thru the exit look for a crew wearing orange and blue, that is Olympus. Then he asked us if we were interested in going on excursions\u2026. BASICALLY, after this point the gentleman tried to get us to come to an informational session for Timeshares under the guise of a free excursion. WATCH OUT FOR THESE GUYS and WARN YOUR GUESTS ABOUT THEM! There\u2019s at least 40 of them situated right at the exit door and you can be sidetracked into trusting them b/c they all have the \u201cTourist information\u201d shirts. They\u2019ll even try to tell you that if you book an excursion at your hotel the price will be far greater then booking w/ them, which is not true at all. Transportation from the airport to the hotel took 1 hr and 45 mins b/c we stopped at three other hotels to drop off other guests. On Tues, we met a nice family from NY while having lunch and they told us that based on other traveler\u2019s advice on Tripadvisor, they had arranged for private transportation to avoid all of these stops---they paid $125 for a family of 5-roundtrip, which is extremely cheap. Basically, ARRANGE FOR PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION FROM AIRPORT TO HOTEL and back. What was supposed to be a 40 min trip to Riu Palace Rivera Maya from Cancun Airport took us twice as long which made us very cranky when we finally arrived. While riding thru Cancun and Playa del Carmen we were able to get a sense of city. In Playa, the streets got a bit tight and was bustling w/ locals and tourists. I was a little worried of how our hotel was going to look situated in such an area. However, to get to RPRM, you have to enter a gated community of nice hotels and homes. There are 2 security checkpoints which made me feel very safe. Arrival To Rprm Now, in Aug 2008 I stayed at the Riu Palace Punta Cana for a destination wedding and had a blast. I was completely sold on Riu and my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to also have a DW. Thus, the purpose of my stay at RPRM was to assess the grounds, beach, accommodations, customer service and food. Grounds When we pulled up to RPRM you truly feel like you are approaching a Palace (just like the Riu in Punta Cana)! With all of the castle posts it kinda of reminds me of the Taj Mahal. When we first walked into the hotel, there was a musty wet socks smell. I was really bothered by this, but I just wanted to check in. The next day I really didn\u2019t notice it much. I guess it comes and goes. Hotel lobby, like RP Punta Cana, looks palatial! Beautiful chandelier, semi spiraling staircase, just grand. The grounds\u2014indoor and outdoor\u2014are very well kept. Everywhere you turn there\u2019s cleaning staff either mopping, dusting, or brooming. The courtyard, again, exactly the same as RP Punta Cana--picture perfect, greener than green shrubbery, etc. Beach The water is just beautiful! No seaweed, rocks, etc. Just clear as day. In waist deep water, my fianc\u00e9 even saw a fish swim by. Although we didn\u2019t go scuba diving, we overheard others say that they did and that they enjoyed it. As other reviews have reported, there are these huge ugly sand bags AKA \u201cwhales\u201d installed all along the beach to prevent beach erosion. These whales are a monstrosity b/c it ruins your pics and the scenery, however, its a necessary evil. I met w/ Juan Carlos Magellon, the hotel wedding photographer, and inquired as to how wedding pics will come out w/ these ugly whales? He said he has a specific area where he takes pics where the whales aren\u2019t too visible and that he redacts/retouches the whales out, this was comforting. From the shore to the \u201cwhales,\u201d the water will only reach about chest level, however, when a strong wave comes in, you can get covered. All in all, to get a good swim, you\u2019ll have to go beyond the whales. On Mon and Tues of our stay, the waters were tooo rough for any water sports. Also, I regret that I have to report this, but, unfortunately, I was informed by numerous guests that on Mon a guest actually drowned in the ocean due to the strong undercurrent. He left behind a wife and child. The hotel staff rendered 15 mins of CPR, but to no avail. I was also informed that the gentleman may have been drinking and that he swam past the whales\u2014alcohol + a strong undercurrent=potential disaster. There was a lifeguard on duty when I went to the beach, so I made sure we swam in his general vicinity and I recommend that everyone do the same. By Wednesday, the water was much calmer and all the water sports resumed\u2014parasailing, banana boat, paddle boat, sailing, and jet skiing (the FI and I only went jet skiing and it cost $60\u2014great price and a lot of fun. Pool Pool-- nice, swim up bar, plenty of pool chairs and umbrellas, but get there early for the good spots! Pool wasn\u2019t heated in the evenings when it got a bit cooler, RP Punta Cana was. Accommodations, Food, and Alcohol The rooms were exactly as I remembered them. Junior Suites, King size bed, balcony, and living room w/ a flat screen TV. Bathroom was spacious w/ double sinks, beautiful countertops. Huge closet w/ a laptop sized safe electronically accessed w/ your own personal pin code. Fridge and liquor dispensers, modern decor\u2014open layout, dark mahogany wood. Rooms were cleaned everyday. Air conditioning could have been stronger, but if you also turn on the fan you\u2019ll be fine. The staff was friendly. We had no overt problems. Check in was smooth, we were greeted with drinks while we checked in, and our bags were brought to our rooms by a bellboy. Food at the sports bar sucks\u2014refrigerated hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches that you warm in a microwave. Food at buffet and chili\u2019s outdoor grill was great. Only got to go to one specialty restaurant--Chili\u2019s Steakhouse\u2014steak was alright, the seafood platter was good, really liked the baked Alaska dessert. Alcohol--they had all top shelf liquor, but if you want a drink with a certain brand you have to ask or they will use the well options. Dislikes Three things disturbed me: (1) water in the bathroom tub did not drain properly so when we took a shower bathwater accumulated around our feet\uf04c I hate this, so I quickly called front desk. Someone was sent right away, but he had no plumber tools or drano. Disgustingly, he tried to pump the drain w/ his hand. He then swished around water in the tub and then told us that everything was ok. We knew this was impossible, so I tried to ask him in my broken Spanish if he could get access to drano. He couldn\u2019t understand me so we left him go. We didn\u2019t call the front desk again b/c our stay was short, we didn\u2019t want to wait around for wrkrs to come and fix it, and we didn\u2019t want wrkrs coming in and out of my room while we were gone for the day. It was truly bothersome to have to turn the water off half way thru a shower just to allow the bathwater to drain; (2) the air conditioning in the room could have been better, but as previously stated if you turn on the fan you\u2019ll manage. (3) Lastly, the customer service at RPRM was like an assembly line w/ no wiggle room. For example, our first night in Mex my fiance and I mistakenly thought that the buffet closed at 1030pm we were running a little behind that night, but made it to the buffet at 10:18pm. Well, the buffet closed at 1015 pm rather and we weren\u2019t allowed to go in and get a couple of scraps. We were told to go to the sports bar or order rom svc. I mean 3 mins! This would have never happened at RPRC. Overall Assessment If I had to compare the staff, grounds, food and customer service at RP Riviera Maya to that of RP Punta Cana I would definitely say that RPPC takes the cake hands down. My sentiments were echoed by/ 3 other guests that I talked to while at RPRM (another guest preferred RP Aruba). Notwithstanding this comparison, our stay at Riu Palace Riviera Maya was still terrific. The food was good, the beach was clean and when the water was calm it was very enjoyable, drinks were also good. The nightly entertainment was great\u2014very talented crew. The excursions look super exciting, but we didn\u2019t have time to get to any. We did take a cab into town and brought a lot of souvenirs\u2014Clothes, jewelry, cohiba cigars that are way cheaper than the ones sold at the hotel, and masseuses offering $30 massages.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cNice place, but a bit disappointed\u201d", "Author": "Maxine10", "ReviewID": "UR28729990", "Content": "Have just returned form a week at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya which we booked through Thomson. We usually use Kuoni, but could only fly cetain days so ended up with Thomson. Plus points - two good sized pools, nice beach area, Negative points - service, staff attitude, restaurant reservations, complex layout,expensive for what it was The flight was ok. Plane branded first Choice. Seats were comfy and there was plenty of room. Our screens did not work for the entire flight and the food was poor. In standard class, you have to pay \u00a35 to get your tv screen upgrade to watch more movies. play more games and to be able to pause & rewind. All drinks are chargable. Athough if you pay for premium seats (extra \u00a3200) both these are included. Transfer to the resort took forever. We had to wait in a hot mini bus at the airport for over an hour for two more guests who god knows what they were doing. The actual transfer time is around an hour. The road has lots of topes (speed restriction devices) these are either two rows of very evil domes or worse still two dug out pits which really make for a rocky ride! At the hotel, got the welcome drink on arrival and assistance with luggage to our room. We were in 3066 - not the greatest location. On the third floor overlooking the plaza. These rooms have smaller balconies that the lower rooms and are smaller in size too. Lots of stairs or a long walk to use the lift also! Cleanliness was ok, not five star standard. There were hairs in the bath and nail varnish from the previous occuapants. Grouting around the bath was poor and the clothes drier was missing from the balcony. As we had no restaurant reservations, dinner was in the Don Manalo restaurant (main one)This is a large buffet. Lots of choices of food available, but very noisy and busy. To make restanurant reservations you need to visit the lady who sits in the main lobby bar area between 12 noon and 3pm. You join the 'line up' and if you are lucky enough to have some availability left when you get to the front you are allowed to make two reservations for the other restaurants, BUT, there are two sittings - either 6.30pm or 8.45pm. During our week we ate at The Steak House (Chillis), the Brazillian (Botafogo) and the fusion (Krystal) Although these are quiter and the service is a little better, the menus are very limited with maybe only the choice of only two or three dishes - all of which you order at the begining of the meal - including dessert! Not really a five star experience. The steak house (chillis) was fine, but the seating is very uncomfortable. The Brazillian was just starters from the salad bar or soup (the smae food as in Don Manalo) then they came round with skewers of meat - sausage,pork,turkey,rib eye steak, fillet steak. A dish of veg is on your table and they carve a small amout of the meat on to your plate. The skewers do not come all together,so the process is long. Dessert is from the buffet and again is the same as DonManlo. Crystal - was the best dining experience, but the menu was very limited and not the best. We thought overall the best food and cetainly choice was DonManalo, but it was the worst dining experience. The service is too efficient in all the restaurants. As soon as you have emptied a glass Or on some occasions not quite emptied a glass or finished with a plate (or they decide that you have finished with a plate) they swoop in and take it away even though the other person is still eating. This really got on our nerves in the end as we found that we were protecting our crockery, cutlery and glasswear! we did not dare venture to the buffet together as when we returned our other items would have been taken from us!!! After a week, the food was begining to get a bit boring, even though there was always lots of choice. Desserts were generally prefrozen and the same ones were available at almost all meals, lunch and dinner. Staff on the whole were good, but reception staff in particular - there first responce to any request always appeared to be No, but we generally manged to get what we wanted in the end. It was maybe just not quite as customer friendly as we would have liked. MiniBar in bedroom - 4 optics - Bacardi, Smirnoff, house Brandy and tequila. In the fridge were beers, coke, lemonade, orange and water. We asked for Gin, Whisky and Tonic water. First told No by reception, then Gin appeared that evening, but no tonic or whisky. Asked again. Told we had to fetch tonic from the bar. Went to bar to get tonic, said they would send some up with room service. We never managed to obtain Whisky. There is a sign in the room saying drinks will be topped up every two days. Our fridge was but our spirits were not. Service at the other bars was Ok, nothing outstanding and no real personalities to comment on. Entertainments Program - this is inflicted on you where ever you are in the resort. On an evening there was live music in the plaze (just below our room) from 7.45pm to around 10pm when the show started. During the day there were events taking place around the pool and beach and music was blasting out all day long. Games included - sexy bingo, water polo, darts, crazy games, water volleyball, volleyball, table tennis etc. We spent the first few days wishing we were somewhere else then decided to go with the flow as we had little alternative! The entertainment team (Rudi, Joshua, Danielle, Pepe, Leo etc) work very hard and are actually a really nice bunch of people. The shows were suprising good, except one - which was drumming and screaming for an hour. We had access to all the Rui hotels with our gold wrist band. You can use the facilities and eat lunch etc at the others but Must have dinner at your own. We had lunch at Tequila and were surprised to find the food was exactly the same. The only difference was the service. At Tequila it was totally self service where as at The Palace it was waiter service drinks. The only other difference we spotted was that the chairs in the plaza area were plastic at Tequila and Wrought iron at The Place. It is worthwile noting that although you have full use of the other hotels there are quite a walk from the Palace. We also visited the Playacar, but prefered the Tequila to this. If you stay at Tequila (which we would do if we did go again) then there are two other Rui hotel much nearer. We did hire a car and driving was fine. Went snorkelling at Yal Ku lagoon, well worth a visit. Had lunch at the restaurant on the way back up the road at Half Moon Bay, cant remember the name though. Had wanted to go snorkelling from here too, but the sea was a bit too rough as it often was. Visited some cenotes and went snorkelling there. WARNING - Mosquitos. 24 bites! Also visited Tulum. Super beach area there, but to gain access we needed to go via a beach restaurant. Mexico itself is line Benidorm for the Brits, to the Americans. Its a long way for somewhere not very different than mainland Spain or the Canaries. Considering the week here cost us in the region of \u00a32500, would we go again? - Probably not.

I am used to staying in fairly nice hotels and resorts and thought that my stay at the Riu Palace would be similar to other resorts in the area. It was not. First of all, the hotel room was never very clean. The maid service was spotty, especially in the bathroom. The bed was extremely uncomfortable, and the sheets never felt clean. The air conditioning barely worked. And most days the room wouldn't be \"cleaned\" until well into the afternoon. In addition, on more than one occasion, the mini-fridge with sodas, beer, and most importantly, bottled water, would not be restocked daily, so that we would have to call room service to request more. The size of the pool is wholly inadequate for the large size of the resort. All of the lounges around the pool were utilized every day, making it impossible to get a seat by the pool (instead of the beach) unless reserving one early in the morning with a towel. The beach area was fine, although it could have been cleaned more regularly. And drink service on the beach was very sporadic; it was quicker to walk to the pool bar to get drinks. Trying to make reservations at the restaurants was a nightmare in itself, and we really shouldn't have bothered, because the food was terrible. It still amazes me that a resort in Mexico has terrible Mexican food. Some of the dishes were truly inedible. In addition, the public restrooms of the resort were not kept very clean, and oftentimes toilets would be clogged and when staff was told, nobody spoke English well enough to understand and do anything about it. The linens (towels, sheets, tablecloths) had stains on them. It made me not even want to eat in some places, which was fine anyways, because the food was so bad. To add insult to injury, the service was deplorable, with or without tips. Only a few of the employees at the resort seemed to care at all about the guests, and were justly compensated. My supposed relaxing vacation was not relaxing at all. I will never visit a Riu Palace resort again, and do not recommend to anyone.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cOne word: WOW\u201d", "Author": "gm2013", "ReviewID": "UR28585266", "Content": "Riu Palace was our best vacation ever! The moment we walked into the marble lobby with crystal chandeliers and plush couches, all of our stress melted away. The moment we walked in our room and saw the \u201cmini bar,\u201d which consists of a bottle of Tequila, a bottle of rum, a bottle of vodka, and a bottle of brandy, we knew we were going to have a lot of fun. This place is amazing! My husband and I stayed for 5 nights in March and we are looking forward to going back and bringing our friends! HOTEL: Lobby is very elegant, and similar to five-star hotels we\u2019ve stayed in, with a gorgeous bar and lots of cocktail tables for indoor imbibing. GROUNDS: Lots of trees and gardens. Very well kept, constantly being cleaned, we didn\u2019t see one single insect during the week we were there! BEACH: no need to get up early to reserve a chair \u2013 there are plenty! You can lie on the beach, on a sandy area shaded by palms, or around one of the two pools! We preferred the beach, which was beautiful and clean. There are volleyball nets if you want to play. Kayaks, boogey boards, and windsurfers are free, but you need to pay for lessons. The sand bags do interrupt the view a bit, but also prevent the waves from being out of control. POOLS: our favorite part was the swim up bar. The pool is a good place to hang out and socialize, there are in pool tables and stools, and two pool-temperature jacuzzis. There is also a shallow pool on an upper level, which is less crowded. SPA: we had a massage, which was very good and cheap at $68 for 60 min! There are hot jacuzzis that are available for everyone, whether or not they buy a spa service. BARS: The best all-inclusive bars we\u2019ve seen! Choice of martinis, Cognac, mojitos and caipirhinas, and fresh fruit drinks. Top shelf liquor. Never needed to ask for extra alcohol, the bartenders are very generous and friendly. ROOMS: large with nice bathrooms. It was difficult to make it completely comfortable as it is humid, and the AC just makes it cold and humid. The safe seemed secure and we used it without any problems. Lots of drawer space if you want to unpack. A flat-screen television is in each room. ROOM SERVICE: 24-hour room service is free with a limited menu. We ordered once when we first came in and it was a great intro to the hotel, but there was never another time we needed to order, and since there are limited choices we preferred to go the buffets. FOOD: The food was very good, but not excellent. The key to the restaurants is to make the reservations as soon as you get there for the next two nights. Also, if you show up to the restaurants at the time of the seating (6:00 and 8:30) and ask nicely, they may seat you without a reservation if there is space. Our favorites were Krystal (upscale fusion) and Yashima (Japanese) for dinner, and Don Manolo for breakfast and lunch. The quality of the food at Krsytal is better than any other place in the hotel. I would recommend eating there more than once and skipping the Brazilian restaurant, which was very mediocre. The lunch at Don Manolo has a lot more variety than Chili\u2019s and is less crowded. Mexican was okay, but had similar food to the buffet at Don Manolo. Chili\u2019s for dinner has surf and turf but it wasn\u2019t anything to write home about. You could skip it. The Spots Bar has food 24/7 and is a good place to get bottled water if you run out. They also have foozball and Internet access ($8/ hr). ENTERTAINMENT: this was the one area that we were not as impressed with, but the evening entertainers did put on a show. We saw two shows, but didn\u2019t stay until the end of either of them. There is a band that plays in the evening outside on the gazebo, and they were very good and very professional. We enjoyed drinking and listening to them after dinner. TIPS: We did feel the need to tip for good service on the resort. At most of the restaurants, the service was simply impeccable, so we tipped 100 pesos or so, and it was very much appreciated, but not expected. We had a few favorite bartenders (Santos and Rene, especially) and we made sure to tip them for their hard work. SUNDRIES: Bring your own suntan lotion! Spray suntan lotion at the resort went for $20/bottle! If you walk down the Playacar street a little, you\u2019ll come to a few stores sandwiched between a couple of resorts. One store (the furthest from the main road and closest to the Rui Palace) sold those bottles for about $12, a much better deal and worth the five-minute walk. TALUM: We did a half-day Talum trip through out travel tour people on Travelocity (Olympus Travel). It was approximately $60/person, and included van transportation, bottled water, and admission to and a tour of the ruins. Talum is the closest of the Mayan ruins, and it\u2019s a good excursion if you want to see some history while you\u2019re in Mexico. FIFTH AVENUE: We walked to Fifth Avenue in Playa del Carmen twice from the hotel (and then took a $5 cab ride home both evenings). While we did not eat or drink there (why bother, when we had a gold bracelet that allowed us to eat and drink to our heart\u2019s content at the Palace?), we did shop and purchase a few items of clothing in a few stores. The area is really touristy and caters to the cruise crowd. Overall, you can\u2019t miss by booking a stay at this resort. A friendly staff caters to your every need, and the resort grounds are amazing.", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place and such a great value.\u201d", "Author": "arlenenruss", "ReviewID": "UR28528669", "Content": "We stayed at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya the first week of April 2009. We arrived at the airport around 3pm, but by the time we got to the resort, it was close to 5. We were welcomed with a drink, given our room key, and the belman took our lugage to the room. We stayed on the bottom floor and had a great jr. suite. I didn't smell anything out of the ordinary like others have complained about. The room was clean although we did see some type of small flying insect on the bed. The room was stocked with beer and soda along with some lower end alcohol (vodka, tequila, rum, and brandy). Again, no complaints about the room except that it was pretty far away from the nearest ice machine. I absolutly loved the location of the room as it was closer to the main building than the beach. If you are night people and want to sleep in, I would recommend a room closer to the main building. The pool area can get pretty loud early in the morning. We ate at the buffet the first night and they had an excellent spread with all sorts of different types of food. After dinner, we relaxed in the courtyard listening to a band and mariachi group. Excellent service by the wait staff who quickly offered another drink if they saw you were getting low. The entertainment ended and we went back to our room. My only complaint was that the entertainment during all the nights ended pretty early (10 pm) and there was really nothing to do afterwards at the resort as the pool is closed. We woke up the next morning too late to make it to breakfast. We had lunch instead at the buffet next to the pool. Great food again. We then hung out at the pool and beach. The ocean was a bit warmer than the pool water but the pool water was easy to get used to after a few minutes. It was not cold as others have complained. I had to wait in line for dinner reservations and got there about 30 minutes after they began accepting reservations. That night the only restaurant seating available was at the mexican restaurant for the late seating. I took that one along with a reservation for two days later at the Japanese restaurant. The food at both restaurants was delicious although I heard some not so good reviews about the Brazilian restaurant from some others at the resort. After dinner we walked over to the RIU Tequila and went to the dance club. We are in our early 30's and the place made us feel old! It was full of 18-21 year olds who obviously don't know how to dance any other way than grinding on eachother. It was quite disappointing. We walked back to the hotel (about 1/4 mile) had another drink and called it quites for the night. The next day we went to XCaret and went swimming with the dolphings (highly recommend it). Got back to the resort exhausted from the excursion. Had a couple of drinks inside the main building and called it quites. We spend the next day at the pool. The water was much colder this day but it had been pretty windy the day before so this may have played a part in the temperature. We eventually got in, had several more drinks at the pool bar, hung out with new friends and relaxed. Dinner at the Japanese restaurant and then off to the Michael Jackson show which was great. We really had a good laugh. Woke up the next day, had breakfast (finally made it to breakfast!!!) and found the selection to be small but adequate. We walked to the small shopping area nearby, bought some stuff to take home, and headed back to the hotel before our ride picked us up to take us to the airport. Had one last drink (mojitos and miami vice are delicious) and said farewell to the resort. This was an excellent vacation and a bargain at under $1400. We walked through several of the other RIU resorts nearby and with the exception of the Palace Mexico, they do not even compare. I sill prefered Palace Riviera Maya over Palace Mexico because the beach was nicer at Riviera Maya.

I submitted a review 1/2/09 with a lot of pictures and detail so if you want to look back you can see my pictures. I will say the atmosphere at Christmas and New Years was different and the mixture of guests was different for Spring Break. There were not unattended high school or college kids there, they don't allow it. There was more glitz at Christmas and New years and a wider selection of upscale food but I would expect that too. The price in April was 1/3 less and summer is 2/3 less than Christmas and New Years. We had another wonderful trip and there were 5 of us ranging from 11 to 50. I will say the 11 year old, 19 year old and 21 year old has as much fun as the parents. The weather was spectacular and there was always a breeze to wind which made the 85-87 degree temperature easy to tolerate. The sun was hotter than December so you could surely burn easier so beware. The other interesting observation, at Christmas the Caribbean was warmer than the pool and now the pool is warmer than the Caribbean, both refreshing. Having been there 3 months ago everyone still remembered us and the service, from management to the cleaning staff, was just as friendly and helpful as before. They bend over backwards for you. There were a few bumps this time which were a minor inconveniences but still a nuisance since we had been there before and had made requests 2 months prior to arrival. The rooms we requested were not available the first night and we were placed in a noisy second floor room near the entertainment which was changed the next day. Octavio, at the front desk was very helpful in orchestrating that move. As for the rooms, they are always very nice and clean and I always tipped the cleaning staff daily. It didn't seem to matter as for as your care but they must say Hola to everyone that walks by a 1000 times a day. As I mentioned, our first room on the south side near the entertainment stage was loud, but the show that night was extremely loud. It is over by 11 PM. Our next room, which was 2 doors down from the room I had requested, on the north side 3rd floor was a Superior Junior Suite with a view of the Caribbean over the palm trees and courtyard. The problem there was the air-conditioning was not functioning properly so they came immediately and worked over 1 hour. It never cooled like it should have but it was comfortable just more humid than before. And the final minor problem was that 1 night we were visited by a cucharacha, roach, on the floor which being from Texas originally was no issue but my 11 year old freaked. So it is in an area which is hot and humid. Yes there is a smell which when we came home is distinctive as before. We didn't really notice it there after the first day. The restaurants from Don Manolo's buffet, Japanese, Chili's Steak House, Mexican, Brazilian and Finally Krystal's the gourmet restaurant were very good for an all inclusive. Krystals had Chilean Sea Bass which was excellent. Chili's Steakhouse is outside and , as noted before it was very good, and yes you may get a mosquito bite. Krystal's and the Japanese restaurant were my favorite. The sushi was very good and I eat sushi all the time. The salmon was excellent as was the beef tenderloin. Also, as for the Manolo's buffet at night, there is a wide variety of food which changes each night with certain specialty nights. The food is good to very good and the service is excellent. Alberto, Rosario, Jesus and the rest of the staff were superb. They made you fill like you were their most important diner. The breakfast buffet also had a wide assortment of food from custom omelets, pancakes, waffles, fresh fruit and freshly made fruit smoothies of all types. You should note that Krystal's and The Japanese restaurants require pants for the men. At lunch time Chili's, open air by the pool, has a buffet for the the entire afternoon. I think it is repetitive in a lot of things like burgers, pizza and hot dogs but there are hot items which change through the week. I would say the food is good to very good for an all inclusive. The best hidden secret is tha Manolo's, the main buffet, opens from 1 PM to 3 PM and has different food. It is always open, quiet and air-conditioned if you want to get away from the pool. Most people are not aware. The grounds are beautiful and immaculately groomed. You might see an iguana as we did and a small brown mammal that they have a name for but looks like a chocolate colored kangaroo rabbit. There are plenty of Geckos.I can't believe how hard these people work. The beach area is beautiful and of the 5 RIU's in the complex it is the best. In fact it is the best of all the resort beaches. Sand whales are there and were made to protect the beach from erosion. They are a necessity but respect them. We saw kids jumping off of them and they are slippery and can have barnacles so it is easy to get cut. Also, you must respect the Caribbean and I wouldn't venture out past the sand whales. The current can get strong and changes outside of them. We had a blast crashing some big waves and with a mask saw schools of smaller fish. It is not a reef though. The pool is huge and there are 2. The upper, infinity pool is quieter and the lower pool has water volleyball. Of course you have the swim up bar and swim up lounge tables to drink at if you are so inclined. The bar staff and pool waiters are excellent. and really have fun. Our only problem was some drunk must have dropped a glass cigar tube into the pool 1 night and a 10 year old girl and someone in our party cut there foot but management was all over that with divers to get the glass out and no further problems. Why would glass be allowed anywhere near a pool is my question. The activities staff are a lot of fun. Jimmy, Pepe, David, Joshua, Ruddy, Leo and Edna work hard to make it fun. Edna is fantastic with the younger kids and they all like kids. I think at Spring Break there was more drinking by the the guests and less participation but there was always something to do from pellet gun shooting contests, volleyball, beach soccer, horseshoes, ping pong tournaments and regular volleyball. The shows at night were good but there were several that were new from Christmas and excellent. They had a Michael Jackson impersonator from Pueblo, Mexico, who you would guarantee is Michael Jackson. His face, body, dancing and even his voice when he talked. He lip synched most of the songs but sang 3 and you could not tell the difference. It was one of the best shows I have ever seen. They also had a show with the trapeze which was very good. One night there was an ad lib show because of rain and that was the funniest of them all. All I can say is be careful if they ask for volunteers on stage at night. I went once. Also, ask yourself if you really want to win Sexy Bingo at the pool. I learned my lesson at Christmas. I also wanted to add about safety since so much is being written about Mexico today. The Riu is in Playacar which is essentially gated. There are beautiful homes on the same road as all of the resorts are on. You cannot just drive in there without a special sticker on your car. The drivers from the airport have to leave their id's their when they come in and pick them up when they leave. We walked around day and night and it never felt unsafe. Hopefully, I have helped you and please feel free to e-mail me. I think you would enjoy the resort since it isn't huge and you don't have to walk all over creation to get somewhere. Playa Del Carmen is a 20 minute walk north and it was worth visiting. We hit Senor Frogs one day and had fun. Xel Ha for snorkeling, Coba if you want to climb a Mayan ruin, the only place to do that, and scuba diving, offered right at the pool for those who would like to try it or do a resort course and go out for a reef dive. My daughter loves the RIU Palace RM and we will be back in June and for 2 weeks at Christmas again. I think it is a great place for families or adults but if you are looking for night life and partying you will have to go outside into town. You can get whatever you want there.

Not a single, solitary thing went wrong during the entire week. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and I've never seen a cleaner resort. The entire staff, from housekeeping to the waiters to the bartenders, everybody was extremely pleasant and helpful. You were made to feel as if you were the only guest. Our room was spacious and spotless. The towel animals left on our bed were a nice touch. The buffett food was the best, although we tried 2 of the speciality restaurants - the Mexican and the steak house. Get a margarita from Claudia in the Sports Bar - the best ever! I truly can't believe that people can find something to complain about, but I'd like to address a few. Musty smell - you're at a tropical resort. Small room - how much time do you spend in your room when you're on vacation and just how much space do you need? Bad food - I'll never understand this one - I thought the food was excellent and gorgeously presented. Dirty beach - could be the result of the rude slobs who leave their drink glasses and dishes down there for someone else to pick up. Sand whales - they serve a purpose. Unfriendly staff - I never, not once, encountered ANY staff who did not smile and say hello when you passed them in the hall or ANY staff who did not go over-board to make you feel as if you were the only person they were waiting on. We asked for a mattress pad because our bed was too hard and they replaced the entire thing with a brand-new pillowtop mattress! In the restaurants, your dirty plate is removed almost instantaneously and your drinks are constantly refilled. We never had to wait for or ask for a thing! I loved this place and would go back in a heart-beat! In fact, we're going back to Mexico in October and wouldn't think of trying out another resort - this one has it all. My one and only complaint (and it has nothing to do with the hotel but the guests) is that it's hard to get a lounger by the pool when you've got people who get up hours before they intend to use a lounger and put a towel on it to reserve it, then go back to their rooms to get dressed and go to breakfast, confident in the fact that their lounger will be there for them when they finally get around to going to the pool - pretty rude. Although there are signs that say you aren't allowed to reserve loungers, it's done every morning. Wish the hotel would enforce this rule. 5th Avenue is a $5 cab ride away. One tip - arrive with plenty of ones for tipping - it gets you extra special service. DO NOT expect to get them after you arrive. And if you need extra money, the only ATM that we could find that dispensed American dollars is inside Senor Frog's off 5th Avenue by the ferry landing.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Sparcl", "ReviewID": "UR28213141", "Content": "OK where do I begin, I read all the reviews before I left and now I'm going to return the favor.

We went to 5th Ave twice, once during the day and once at night we also walked to the little shopping area up the street a bit twice and never had any problems. The hotel was clean all of the time, the room was nice and clean no issues at all. The only thing I didn't like was having to get up before the crack of dawn to get descent chairs by the pool that were in the sun. There were plenty of chairs on the beach so you will always be able to get a chair somewhere. The drinks were always available and they made them however you requested, Jose Cuervo, Jim Bean, Absolute, Bacardi, Cointreau. The beach was very nice, water was like bath water but a little ruff most days. The food at the buffets were good, we went to three of the specialty restaurants and the only one I enjoyed was the Japanese, I left the Mexican restaurant and went to the buffet and the steak restaurant was just ok, my steak was too salty so I ate bread it was too late to make the buffet before it closed @ 10pm. The food that is available 24/7 in the Sports bar was not good, cold hamburgers you warmed up in the microwave and soggy sandwhiches. I also visited the spa and had two massages which I enjoyed but thought were a little expensive but it was my birthday. I'm already planning to visit another Riu in Jamaica.

The lounging area on the beach was beautiful, but the beach itself was not. There are big huge bags of sand/concrete everywhere to prevent the tide from washing the beach away. If you walk down the beach some of the resorts have lost their beaches entirely. If you are looking for beautiful beaches, I would recommend staying in a resort further south (ie near Tulum or Puerto Adventuras). Pool loungers are snatched up by 8:30 in the morning and people will reserve loungers for hours before showing up to actually use them. The pool however has a beautiful view of the ocean.

The Japanese restaurant was fantastic. The beach was beautiful. Would have like to enjoy the waves a little more, though, without the sand barriers. Our room was great. Yes, we had two beds pushed together, but they came up and made it into one with a king size mattress pad, etc. and you could not tell it was two beds. Did the room have a musty smell? Maybe a tad, but nothing unusual for a hotel in the tropics. The room was very spacious and clean. You can definitely tell tourism is what they rely on because the service was out of this world. Drinks were great! Just bring your own larger plastic mug and they'll fill it up. Much better than the smaller cups they have. Channo at the swim up bar makes the best Tickets to Fly.

We never had to wait long for a drink at the pool bar and didn't have a problem finding lounge chairs. The sand bags in the water were not a problem, they blocked the waves and created a cove. There was always someone making sure the beach was clean. The hotel also has a cheerful entertainment staff that made our stay fun. The hotel also has free internet access in the lobby which was very convenient for communication to home, just bring your laptop! Our mini bar was always stocked with bottled drinks and our room had a liquor dispensor in it. My only complaint was that the walls of the room were thin, we could hear all the commotion going on in our hallway. I would recommend requesting a room on an upper floor with a beach view.

Some reviewers criticize the Riviera Maya for not being a 5-Star resort, and it\u2019s probably not. However, it\u2019s a great property and the staff goes out of its way to make your vacation an amazing experience. In all honesty, the hotel and its grounds are 5-Star quality. The staff is friendly and helpful, but not efficient enough to compete with most Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties. Notwithstanding, I would still rate the staff as 4-Star + (the effort is there). The buffet food is 4-Star quality at best and the specialty restaurant food is probably 4-Star + quality. The bottom line, this is a grand resort with solid service and it\u2019s an excellent value. The Good: The grounds are impeccably clean. Our room was kept very tidy and we appreciated the creative towel animals our maid left for us. The wait staff was always eager to provide us with cocktails and the tropical drinks were excellent. Not all liquor was top shelf, but it was good enough for us. The wine selection was creative (some off the beaten path selections from Mexico and South America). All liquor was included in the room price. We especially loved the Havana Bar with its old world style. The food was solid but not spectacular. The buffet dining options were cruise ship quality. The specialty restaurants generally had better food and more creative selections; we especially enjoyed the fusion restaurant. The Mexican restaurant and Steakhouse were very good. We heard good things about the Japanese restaurant and most people did not love the Brazilian venue. The food in the Sports Bar was basically 7 Eleven style. But, it was fine for a late night snack. Again, all food (including the specialty restaurants) was included in the room price. The hotel and its surrounding grounds were grand and well maintained. The pool was large and cleaned on a nightly basis. The resort\u2019s beachfront was a short walk from the pool area and had plenty of room and chairs available for guests. The \u201cSand Whales\u201d did not bother us at all. In fact, they helped break the waves and made swimming more fun. The wide, clean and quiet beach was a huge plus for me. The resort\u2019s security was effective. We saw them expel at least one visitor who tried to crash from another hotel. Please note, most Spa items were not included in the room price. However, they were reasonably priced compared with other resorts we\u2019ve stayed in. The Bad: The room did have a musty smell for the first couple of hours. However, we listened to other reviewers and raised the air conditioning which essentially eliminated the odor. Some nights were humid and that seemed to be the cause of the odor. We had a first floor room and we had a couple of unwanted pets visit us during the last few days of our stay. Again, it wasn\u2019t a cleanliness issue, we were basically on the first floor of a tropical hotel and a couple of insects decided to pay us a visit. Next time we stay at this Riu Palace, we\u2019ll request a room on an upper floor. It was hard to get a lounge chair at the pool. People seemed to get up pre 7:00AM to put their towels on chairs to reserve them. Sometimes, chairs would remain empty the entire day even though guests reserved them\u2014somewhat frustrating. The first couple of days of our stay we were not able to reserve a specialty restaurant because they were completely reserved. We were able to obtain reservations for the last 4 nights of our trip and we generally liked the specialty restaurants better than the buffet dining. Many guests found the specialty restaurant reservation process to be annoying (must reserve between Noon and 3:00PM each day and you can\u2019t make more than 3 reservations at a time). It was only a slight annoyance to us. The fitness center was weak. They need to add more cardio machines and weights. They have the room to make it much better. The Ugly: N/A The walk into the town of Playa del Carmen takes about 10 minutes. It\u2019s a lovely and safe walk. Don\u2019t forget to take in the Mayan ruins along the way. They are really interesting. Also, we booked 3 tours with Best Day (Rodrigo is an extremely helpful tour rep!) and we loved them all. Tulum is cool, but Chichen Itza and Coba really blew us away. The grand scale of Chichen Itza was awesome and shouldn\u2019t be missed. Coba was discovered more recently and is still partially covered by jungle. We climbed to the top of the pyramid at Coba and it was a breathtaking experience. Don\u2019t miss these great trips. If you take the express trips with Best Day you\u2019ll be back at the hotel by mid afternoon so you can enjoy the resort. It\u2019s really worth your time. If you have travel insurance with another tour company, you may want to use them for your excursions. If not, we highly recommend Best Day. The water used in the hotel restaurants and bars is safe to drink (including the ice). However, the water in the bathrooms is not filtered. Use bottled water (which is provided by the hotel) to brush your teeth. To sum up, the Riu Palace Riviera Maya succeeded at one very important thing, it provided us with a fun and relaxing vacation at an excellent value. The staff, the grand resort buildings/grounds and the awesome beachfront were huge pluses.

To begin, you must accept that you are travelling to Mexico, their first language is Spanish, so.... yes there will be some language barriers and yes the tv channels will not be in English! Please adjust yourself and your expectations and you will have an incredible visit to the Yucatan! Check in was a breeze, Luis was waiting for us with our reservation in hand and we were in our room within minutes of our arrival. The Bellboy was not too far behind with our luggage. We had a Junior Suite, it was facing another resort, however, the Riu has done some beautiful landscaping and we had some palm trees between us. and OH YA, we didn't go tor the view from our hotel room, we went for the beach and good weather! Our sheets were changed throughout the week, fresh towels were replaces as we placed soiled towels in the bathtub (there's a sign in the bathroom explaining), double sink in the bathroom, VERY clean bathroom. The maid thoroughly cleaned and mopped our room every single day, no complaints. We didn't even tip everyday, just at the end. We had great service. We did use the electronic safe without issue in the room, enjoyed the liquor dispenser and our beverages in the mini fridge were stocked promplty. The person who stocks the fridge is different from the maid, just an FYI. If something wasn't replaced just call room service! The facilities are incredible, no picutures will do it justice. I can not estimate the countles hours of scrubbing and moping the tiles happens daily. Everyone is friendly, I can only speak a couple of phraes in Spanish but it goes a long way to demostrate your friendliness and respect for people. The food was wonderful, breakfast is a top notch 5 star buffet. However, if you need a very specific breakfast to start your day then be practical and learn how to say it in Spanish just in case. I watched a frustrated traveller curlty request \"fried eggs\" to the omellete lady and walk away from her when she requested assistance from a colleague. He was upset and so was the omellete lady. Just google it for your comfort or try new foods. I had warm rice pudding for breakfast with cinnamon and sugar for the first time and it was amazing! Lunch at Chili's (at the beach) is also good, burgers, pizza etc, coffee maching, icecream maching, quality salad choices. You can also have lunch at the main buffet Don Manolo's Dinner at the a la cares were by far the best food, good cuts of meat, signature drinks at the door and champage on the table if requested. We fostered some good relationships with some of the servers and were treated with some nice flowers on our table throughout the week. You have to line up at 12 noon at the lobby bar and can reserve 2 a la cartes at a time. it's worth the couple minutes your spend in line. Just send one person from your group, there's always one person in a group who is willing to leave the beach for a couple of minutes! We tried them all except the Brazillian, we ate at the Japanese twice because it was so good! We always booked the 8:45 dinner slot, at first I didn't understand why there were only 2 dinner slots but after some asking we learned that there was a lot of prep involved (wait until you see the presentation of the food), if you get hungry go the the dinner buffet and grab some snacks! they even had chocolate fountain one nigh! This resort as the best beach, we went for walk one day and realised how lucky we were, most hotels have had there beach wiped out by the hurricanes and can only offer the pool to their guests, the sand whales did not bother us one bit, the water is still a gorgeous turqoise blue. There was always a cooler full of bottled water at the beach bar, we would always bring a big bottle with us from our room. We never had to walk 3 city blocks. The service here was immpeccable, can't say enough. Tipping although not expected or required was always apprciated. Staff here work 6 days a week (typical work week in Mexico) and long days. We always had a host tend to our table and ask us how are meal was and offer us a drink after eating, a really nice touch. I did hear people from time to time in the hallways but nothing that bothered me, I brought earplugs with me from reading all the reviews here but I never came close to using them. This is a fantastic hotel, definately not a party place for spring breakers (which we like to avoid), if you want fun days in the sun, quiet days by the beach and relaxing evenings with delicious food, and live entertainment every night then this is a great option.

Surprisingly, the buffet dinner wasn't bad and had a decent selection of food that changed nightly. I personally loved their sushi night which they were rolling fresh in front of everyone. The only down side was the reservation process, which they wouldn't allow people to call from their rooms. There are designated times that you have to go to the lobby and make reservations and a lot of times, the restaurant that you want is booked up, or you have to take a later reservation time than you preferred.

Surrounded by white stucco, water fountains, and large palm trees, the courtyard is so picturesque with an elegant Mexican flair. The lobby and lobby bar are incredibly elegant too. The granite floors shine as do the numerous crystal chadeliers. The rooms are very large with a large bathroom, and the beds were very comfortable. About the only thing we can complain about is that the water pressure wasn't sustained to keep the shower head running constantly, which really isn't that much of an incovenience. Every day the room fridge/bar is replenished so potable water was always available. The beach is one of the largest on this stretch of beach and the swim up bar is just a short walk. The resort staff leave you wanting for nothing. They are so attentive and more than willing to please their guests. We fell in love with their smiles!

We were there from March 13 to March 19. We had 2 rooms on the second floor that faced the hotel next door. My wife and I just returned from a week at the Iberostar Grand Hotel Paraiso. It was a great hotel and I think it spoiled us. That being said there are some big positives but also some negatives at the Riu Palace RM. Service - The Riu has great service. In some ways I think it beat the Grand. The restaurant service was great at both the buffets and the specialty restaurants. The maid service was very good. Everyone we met was smiling and very positive. I always tip for service. I was disappointed to see many people not tipping (at the restaurants, at the pool bar, at the lobby bar). Come on folks! A few pesos...por favor! Food - While the Grand had some very upscale choices (lobster for lunch and dinner), I think the food at the Riu was better. We ate at the Japanese, the Mexican and Fusion specialty restaurants. Fusion was our favorite with the Japanese a close second. We ate at the buffets for breakfast, lunch and 2 dinners. There was always lots of choices. Everything was fresh and hot. The only thing that was disappointing was the limited room service menu. There were only a few choices and they are mainly focused on basic kids type food (chicken nuggets, etc.). It was nice having the option of picking up a small salad at the sports bar. The sports bar is open 24/7. It is a good place for early risers to get an morning coffee before the breakfast buffet opens. Rooms - Yes you get that musty smell on the first day. Just put the AC way down and keep the fan running 24/7 and it goes away in a few hours. Our rooms did also have a dampness that did not go away. The sheets felt wet at night. The beds were on the hard side, but we slept fine. The room furnishings were typical of a nice AI. The flat screen TV was nice but the quality of the cable service was just OK. Hotel Facilities - excellent grounds, pool was great, the beach is the largest in the area. We didn't mind the sand whales. You have the option of sitting in ths shade under the palms or out closer to the water. One of my daughters loved the hammocks. Both daughters were very disappointed with the workout room (A few old tired machines). It's time for an upgrade! We liked the open courtyard at night. There was always some music playing (either a small band or a singer or a trumpet player). Drinks were served. It was a nice place to start or end the evening. We usually went before dinner (we had the late sitting at 8:45). And speaking of a late dinner...let's talk reservations. Who came up with the idea of making customers stand in line in the middle of the day (12 - 3 pm) to sign up for dinner reservations? Come on....buy a $10 computer program and make it electronic. Allow customers to sign themselves up online or at the front desk anytime of the day. So overall it was a good vacation. We relaxed, got some sun, and ate too much. It sure beats working!", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlantic City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLook No Further This Is It!\u201d", "Author": "primadonna11", "ReviewID": "UR26357949", "Content": "I usually travel to PDC every year. I have stayed at many of the resorts in PDC and Riviera Maya. I like to try different places every year, but now that has to come to an end. I will only be staying at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya from now on! I traveled with my sweetie from March 11-15th, the weather perfect, except it rained one day. I will do the best I can on the review despite the fact that we both came down with the stomach flu-(bad) starting on the first night and lasting for most of the time we were there. This had NOTHING to do with the resort, (as no one else there was sick and this virus takes about 4 days to get a hold of your system) I think I got it from work before we left-figures! AIRPORT: For first timers, when you land in Cancun, after you go through customs keep walking out of the airport. Do not talk to anyone, even though they are asking about your tour and look official. These are the time share people, and they will carry your luggage outside and wait for a tip. Keep walking until you get outside where the vans are parked. If you booked through a tour, Olympus reps will have orange shirts, Apple Vacations will have dark blue flowered shirts on, and Sunjet will be wearing turquise. Sorry if I missed anyone. They are the only ones to talk to at the airport, but they cannot go inside. The ride was smooth and quick. We were the 2nd ones dropped off, about 45 minute ride. RESORT: Drop dead beautiful. I have been to several resorts in the area, some more expensive than this, and let me tell you, this is worth every penny and more. When you enter the lobby it looks so grand and beautiful and everyone greets you with a smile. The other vacationers all got quiet when our van pulled up, and one exclaimed that their resort better be as beautiful as this one! Check in was a breeze, super fast, and all reps speak excellent English. They even provided a cold MaiTai, nice after a long flight. The check in time is supposed to be around 3:00 p.m., but they gave us our room at 11:30! No waiting at all-couldn't have asked for more. ROOM: Great, had everything we needed and excellent view. We had room 3070, on the top floor with a vaulted ceiling, strong AC and ceiling fan. For those of you complaining about the smell, you may want to stick to cruising, because there is not a resort in the area that does not have a bit of a musty smell. Hello, its the tropics with AC blasting all day and closed doors, it is unnoticable after a few minutes, please do not allow those complaints to affect your decision. Anyway, it also had a small balcony perfect for two which got great sun all day. Small fridge fully stocked with water two sizes, sodas, beer and club soda. Also the full bottles of liquor to pre-game before going out is great-although we couldn't partake! The shower did have its ups and downs, it seems at times, the water pressure couldn't hold up, so it may take you longer in there. Bed was great, my back felt better than it had all year long! Flat screen tv and 24 hour room service, closet with plenty of hangers, ironing board and iron, small hair dryer, what more could you need? (The only thing I missed was a coffee maker, but I'm sure if I asked they would have found one for us!) As for the noise complainers, can I just say, that these people are up before dawn working hard so that you have a wonderful vacation, its unfortunate that the floors are tiled and the carts make noise, but come on! Wear ear plugs if you are easily awaken, but it didn't bother us at all. BEACH: This is the show stopper! Some of the resorts in Riviera Maya have smaller beaches with choppier seaweedy water, but not in PDC! (Don't be confused by the name, this resort is right in Playcar, with the best beaches in the entire area.) If you want postcard colored calm water, soft sand, tons of space, and many water activities this is where you'll want to be. Plenty of chairs and tons of palm trees for those who want shade. There are two levels to the beach, an upper and lower, the upper is good if you get some windy days. The bar is right next to the upper beach, and the pool is behind it. The entire day there will be servers to take your order, never expecting a tip, although we did tip all servers-it was hot and they run around all day for us. The sand whales are there to be sure that the beach can last through another storm, they even look indigineous to the area (better than a bunch of sandbags) and swimmers enjoyed climbing on them. POOL: There are two, the infinity pool, which we preferred, it was quieter, and the activities pool that you could look down on from the infinity pool. Water temp was refreshing and water clean. There was a swim up bar with swim up tables, benches and loungers, and even a whirlpool. Water aerobics looked fun, there was always something going on in the main pool if you are looking for fun. There is also a small kids center with a baby pool by the clubhouse. Not many kids at this resort though, so good for those looking for a quiet, relaxing vacay. SERVICE: Second to none, the best in the entire area by far. Everyone greets you with an Hola and a smile, and will got out of their way to provide you with great service. I think this is the same for all Rius because I stayed at the Tequila several years back, and got the same great service. Every day rooms cleaned spotlessly, towel animals and flowers left, fridge stocked. (We tipped a few dollars every day because she did such an outstanding job) Every night we got turn down service with chocolates, one night they even brought us a cold platter of fresh fruit, another night some extra towels fresh from the dryer. That's the best, service even when you don't even ask for anything. Room service was also super fast and good. FOOD: Excellent. The buffets changed every day so that there was variety, tons of selection. The breakfast buffet was the best, even though I don't like breakfast, I couldn't resist. Smoothie bar, freshly squeezed juices, fruits, yogurts, eveything you could imagine. We also ate at Krystal-wonderful food with outstanding service. We got the filet and sea bass, both were excellent. I think this is another Riu thing, because they definitely have the best food out of all of the resorts I have been to in the area as well. Its a shame we couldn't enjoy more of it! 5 AVE: If you go into PDC it is a five minute cab ride or a 20 minute walk, eat at Hotel Basico or OHM, both have awesome food with great atmosphere. There is definitely night life, just not obscene like in Cancun. There is a Carlos n Charlies, Coco Bongo, Senior Frogs if you want to do the touristy bar scene, you'll have a good time. We like the smaller low key places like the parrot bar and Hotel Basico for drinks. Make sure you bargain for your purchases with the vendors, and wait to buy liquour at the airport, it is cheaper there believe it or not! EXCURSIONS: We didn't do any this year, but I would definitely recommend the horse back riding, we do this every year. You go through the jungle out to a private beach, and then can actually swim with a horse. The cowboys are entertaining and expert riders who can handle those first time riders. You get a snack and cold drinks back at the ranch before you leave. Make sure to bring $ for tips for the cowboys, you will get a locker for your belongings if you don't want them with you when you ride. Excaret was great, you can also bring change of clothes and towels because you will get a locker for the day. The underground river was cool and the whole park has something to offer everyone. Make sure you stay for the evening show, it was the best part-really worth it. The swimming with the dolphins was also the best. Great if you have never done it before, so worth the money. You should definitely book online if you are going during Easter break as they are usually sold-out for this time when you get there. Snorkeling-I didn't like it, but I am not the outdoorsy type, and not a good swimmer. The best is near Cozumel but Xel-Ha was ok too. Chichen Itza was amazing if you are really into history because you will learn so much about Mayan civilization, although they don't let you climb the pyramid anymore. This will take up an entire day, the bus ride alone was about 2 hrs and 30 minutes. I haven't done Tulum, that was on the agenda for this time, but from what I hear it is a must with history and the most beautiful beaches and cenotes in the area. OVERALL: This place has everything you could possibly want, and the best luxury for the price. You will have a great time, Mexico can always be counted on for the best weather! If you are looking for sun, sand and service, Riu Palace Riviera Maya has it all! Also, please don't be alarmed by the recent news in Mexico, this is not in PDC, only near the border of US. This worried me a bit before we left, but we did not feel unsafe in any way, plus Playacar is a gated resort community. If you have any questions about other resorts in the area, or any other questions feel free to contact me.

We loved this hotel. The grounds are very well manicured. Staff is friendly. Drinks are plentiful and service is great! Our rooms were very nice, non-ocean view and very quiet. The King size bed was very comfy not hard as others have said. Location is good as it is a short distance to the town of Playa del Carmen. Fun to go and spend the afternoon shopping. Kind of dirty though! We cabbed it for $5.00. Would recommend the $30 massage in Playa. Bargained with them to give my husband and I each a 30 min massage for $35.00 total! Dual massages in the same room. Must do! Ours was done by Oasis Massage. Food at the hotel: Make reservations early for the specialty restaurants! We waited in line at 11:45 and always got in. Reserv start at noon..... Our fav was the steakhouse (Chili's) at night for dinner. Get the steak (filet was excellent) and lobster! Next favorite was the Fusion restaurant called Krystal. Mexican Agave was good too. Buffets are always excellent choice too! Did not really enjoy the shows at night. We missed the good show Michael Jackson. Took excursion to XEL-HA. This was definitely worth it. Beautiful eco park with snorkeling, kayaking, tubing and cliff jumping. Would recommend. All day affair.

We enjoyed our stay and just left the resort twice to visit Playa del Carmen. We only ate at the buffets and never made reservations at the specialty restaurants as we felt it was too much of a hassle to mess with leaving the beach area in the afternoons to make the reservations and did not want to be locked into a specific time to eat dinner. The food at the buffets was good and we always found something to eat that we enjoyed. There is always tons of fresh fruit, salads, breads and pastas for the picky eaters. We ordered room service some afternoons, although thought the menu could be expanded a bit more. Our favorite was the toasties. A couple mornings we order coffee, juice, and fruit for room delivery and it was very good. Although one time our breakfast order never made it to our room and one afternoon our order was delivered to the wrong room. We called and they had a new order up to us fairly quickly. All the wait staff is wonderful and always quick to clear plates and bring refills. We stayed in room 2124, which is actually on the 3rd floor. It faced the back of the property, but since we were in the building closest to the beach/pool we had a great view and could see the ocean from our patio. As mentioned before the doors slam loudly and the carts make a lot of noise. The only time we had issues was when the drunks came back to their rooms around 2 am. I thought with this level of resort we wouldn\u2019t have the drunken issue, but we did. We heard loud talking, swearing in the hallways and on our last night was treated to a drunken fight between the couple across the hall. Their voices carried through the ventilation system so it was like they were standing right next to our bed arguing. Not really the hotels fault, but I think the construction could have been done a bit better. The AC was very bad in our room. There was no happy medium between being too warm or too cold. Plus it was damp all the time, so bad that the sheets at night felt wet. We have been to Mexico several times, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras and never experienced having the sheets feel this way. We didn\u2019t think the room was too musty, but when we got home, we could certainly smell how bad it was on our clothes and suitcases. The maid service was okay. We always tipped, but never seemed to get enough towels. They did not change the sheets everyday, which was a problem for me because I hate sand on the sheets. Also, one day they did not clean our room. I called the front desk three times and finally at 9:00 pm someone came to \u201cclean.\u201d Our frig was not restocked everyday. Finally, we just called room service and had them bring up what we needed. All workers are very accommodating. We spent most of our time on the beach. The only issue we had is on the lower section of the beach there are no drink service down there. Again, for this level of resort they need to have wait staff down there too. The pool area was too crowded \u2013 I have no idea when people put the towels on the chairs, but it must be pretty early. This behavior makes me so mad! The worst part is, most of these reserved chairs go unused for a good portion of the day. This type of behavior needs to stop. On our last day we went to the pool at 7am and barely found 3 chairs in the sun. At 10:30 am most of the reserved chairs closets to the pool were still empty. The resort needs to start taking the towels off the chairs and not allow this to go on. I don\u2019t mind if people hold their chairs when they are eating, but having them empty for hours at a time is ridiculous. The pool is cold and not very clean. If we went in, we went into the upper pool. The lower pool had stuff floating in it from branches to band-aids to straws and even a scummy slime in one corner. There is algae growing on some tiles and overall needs some attention. On our last day we finally saw some people cleaning the pool. If you are going to this resort to hang out around the pool, I would look else where. There are not enough chairs available in the sun and if you do find one, you are so close to your neighbor it is uncomfortable. Overall, we did have a nice vacation and I wouldn\u2019t let a few bad things ruin our time away, but I don\u2019t think we would go back to this resort. If you have tweens and teens, I also would not recommend as there were no kids in that age range. There is topless sun bathing on the beach, so beware if that type of thing bothers you.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "TORONTO", "Title": "\u201cBeutiful Resort an Excellent Holiday!!\u201d", "Author": "ANGELTORONTO", "ReviewID": "UR26180587", "Content": "excellent resort the staff was awsome and very attentive to your needs they really make it the perfect holiday.

A girls only 4 night get-away, left the guys home with kids and pets and cold weather!! We paid for bus transfers, but since there were only 4 of us and early in the morning, we were given a private van and driver. We joked around that we would like to stop for a beer along the way...and he did!! Twice!! He went into the 7-11 to make sure that we got the correct change, even!! We tipped well after that! Rooms weren't quite ready, but we changed into our summer clothes in the change rooms at the main lobby. Rooms were spacious, but we had the construction view at the next hotel, oh well. The refrigerator was well stocked and replenished daily. Beds were very hard, but fell right asleep after a full day in the sunshine. Room service ws top-notch and right on time...red roses every morning with our coffee!! Surprisingly, the buffet food was great!! We were able to reserve 2 restaurants for the 4 night stay, the Steak house and the Fusion. The steakhouse was ok...we had steak and lobster, lobster didn't have a very good taste, but I'm used to Maine lobster..Steak was great. At the Fusion restaurant, the service was great as was the atmosphere. Sea Bass was excellent! Everyone is very friendly. The pool area loungers were always reserved well before dawn. I was surprised that the pool was a little dirty. Limes from drinks, lots of palm branches, sandy bottom...this is usually taken care of in the morning, but didn't seem to get done. Drinks were plentiful and good. If they're not strong enough, just ask for more!! Th beach is the best in that area. Wide beach and plenty of room in the shade and sun. No umbrellas, bur plenty of palm trees for natural shade. We went \"bar hopping\" every afternoon around 4pm...took a stroll down the beach to the other RIU propeties and bellied up to the beach bars...best drinks by far at the RIU Playacar Beach bar... Our room attendant was great...for 3 days, but forgot about us on the last night, no face cloths, no clean towels, no tissues. The only thing is that he may have been busy getting rooms ready for the Friday night arrivals...and we even tipped. Took the 1/2 day excursion to Tulum. Glad I went. Lots of history. Walked to Playa del Carmen one evening. About 20 minutes. Had a good time checking out the shops and having drinks on 5th Avenue. Great sax player at the property one night. When returning to the airport after our trip, we took the standard shuttle service. Never again, as our flight didn't leave until 6:30pm and we were picked up at 2:20pm, and spent an hour visiting other hotel properties to fetch people to the airport.

We also made sure all of our valuables were in the safe(we have traveled to other Riu's and knew that this is something that is recommended). The next morning we made sure the safe was locked and went down for breakfast, our group decided to go shopping for the day. Upon our return to retrieve money from the safe...it was EMPTY. I went down to the front desk and reported this...they looked at me like I was crazy. They said they would look into this and get back with me. That day and into the night....nothing from the staff. My husband and I quickly learned that three other people had money stolen from their safe as well. The thief got away with at least $6000.00. I had to go to the front desk and wait as they located the management they would take me into an office everytime and It was always the same song and dance....We dont know what we can do for you. We will have to check with our insurance company. My Husband spent an entire afternoon at the police station and I spent much of that same day in the office.. Then they were trying to tell me that I had to wait 1-3 weeks to get the money from the insurance company....Who is to say that if I left there that I would ever see it again. They were trying to buy us off by giving us a free room upgrade and free massages which were great however we now had little to no money. An employee of their decided to drill into the safes of 4 peoples rooms and that is how they got the money...We did finally get our money the night before we left however it consumed our entire vacation. Needless to say I will never stay at this hotel again.. We have stayed at the Riu Las Americas and the Riu Cancun and loved both of them ... but not this hotel the management had every opportunity to take care of this incident(especially since there were more than just us to report such an incident) and they chose not to..

The biggest issue that was experienced during our stay was in regard to water ressure for both showers and toilets. We had a jet type tub in the room, but impossible to use due to low water pressure. We could only take showers once we saw water pressure was restored for that moment in time. There were several power outages for short periods of time, but I can live with that for a few minutes. The water pressure for the toilets was horrible. You could not have multiple use of any toilet anywhere following previous use. I had to use a large water bottle to fill our toilet tank in order to get it to flush. It took forever for tanks to refill. And in many cases in public areas the toilets got back up inside due to frequent failed uses and flushes. The doors close very hard in the hollow halls of Riu Palace. With our neighbor coming back drunk at 2pm in the morning I had to call security to get them to let her in the room after she bounded on the door for several minutes since her husband was already passed out in the room. The rest of the time they argued and yelled and used many \"F\" bombs. Not great if you had a family. I was disappointed that on arrival after 3pm on our first day we were not able to make a resturant reservation. Even when we did, they had to be made 2-3 nights later. The food, especially all beef was unhealthly due to heavy salt alone. When you had fish, it ran out fast and you had to stand watch over the buffet line to get the more popular items. I don't think the quality was very good and preferred my previous 4 cruise experiences over the all inclusive experience at RIU Palace. We were told that we could visit other RIU properties but they could not come to our property. However, that was not the case. I saw many people in Buffet Line and Chilis at lunch with different color bands on their arms. The show or entertainment as they called it was bad. The groups performing outside in gazebo were more entertaining. The golf resort course across the street was $190 per round. That was a high price to pay for that experience. It included all food and drinks, but didn't see the cart for this until final 9 holes. I do not think this resort is worth what we paid and was a disappointment. While they tried to send us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary, they waited until late our departure night and it was impossible to drink or eat after midnight when we were leaving the next morning. This would have been a nice gesture on our arrival day. I guess they don't depend on repeat customers and that is a shame. They should want brand loyalty during difficult financial times we are in and that means consistent value and quality.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, But Lacked the Tranquility We Were Seeking\u201d", "Author": "MichaelRoy", "ReviewID": "UR25804547", "Content": "Executive Summary: The Riu Palace Riviera Maya is a good value, especially if you book a deluxe courtyard facing room and take advantage of the top shelf liquor offered 24 hours a day. The food is diverse and tasty enough for a week\u2019s stay, but is not 5-star quality. The staff is friendly and well intentioned, but inconsistent in delivering information or enforcing resort policy. The pool area is impressive, but the cold temperature of the water and the incessant merengue make it less than tranquil and relaxing. The beach area is beautiful and one of the highlights of the property. I imagine this resort would meet the expectations of a lot of people, but if you are looking for a more secluded and quiet stay, I would recommend looking elsewhere. My wife and I booked a weeklong \"babymoon\" stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya through a local travel agent in New York. Our first piece of advice is to skip the airport transport offered through these travel agent packages - they often make several stops at different hotels, delaying your arrival after a long day of travel (hire a car for your trip back to the airport as well). Like other reviewers, I was surprised at the lack of tropical feel for the property - Riu is a Spanish company and the interior is more like an old formal Spanish decor, less a traditional Mexican feel. That being said, it is fairly nice, especially the lobby bar, the rotunda, and the view through the large glass windows toward the ocean. Our first junior suite room had no view, was musty, and had several plumbing issues. We stayed in the room for one night and then requested an upgrade to a better room - after some heated exchanges with the front desk staff, we were upgraded to a deluxe ocean view room at no additional cost - a vast improvement. The manager on duty did right by us, but it should not have been so difficult for us to get the room we wanted. Although it costs $50 extra a night, I recommend reserving the deluxe courtyard facing rooms ahead of time, especially if you can get one closer to the pool and ocean. Overall we were happy with our junior suite room \u2013 the king size bed was quite comfortable, the bathroom was functional, and the sitting area with a sofa and flat screen TV gave the room just enough of a suite feel. The balcony with the view of the sunrise, the pool, the courtyard, and the ocean was by far the best feature. Like other people, we ordered room service from the limited menu and received our items very quickly \u2013 it\u2019s nice to even order breakfast in the room and drink coffee on the balcony. The room did have a few issues: the AC was a little spotty, the room was a little musty, and the cleaning service could have been more thorough. A word of caution about the rooms \u2013 the slamming doors, the cleaning carts rolling on the tile floors, and din of the pool and nighttime plaza music make it difficult to find peace and quiet in your room. In fact, a major theme of this resort is the challenge you might have in finding tranquility and privacy. The pool area includes an infinity wading pool and the larger swimming / daiquiri bar area. Taking a swim in the infinity pool is like walking into a fountain and swimming around \u2013 it\u2019s really refreshing. The larger pool is a bit too cold and contains too much sunscreen in it, making it less inviting. Although the wide angle photos on the Web site exaggerate the enormity of the pool, it is still pretty expansive \u2013 but most people are not in it, because it is too cold or not quite as clean as you would expect. The pool daiquiri bar, complete with pool bar stools, is fun, but the hotel insists on blasting incessant merengue throughout the afternoon, making it difficult to find peace and quiet \u2013 you can hear the music far away in your room and on the beach. The Riu \u201centertainment staff\u201d are a little too microphone happy as well, trying to generate enthusiasm for water aerobics, dance lessons and the like. It seems like a majority of the people would rather sit quietly by the pool to sleep, read, or relax, but the resort seems dead-set on trying to generate a \u201cparty\u201d when it\u2019s really not necessary. And as others have reported, you will find obnoxious people waking up at 6:00am to \u201creserve\u201d their lounge chairs by the pool, despite the signs warning against it. Blame the resort \u2013 they don\u2019t seem to enforce any of the rules of the pool. As you walk away from the pool to the beach, you\u2019ll find rows of mature palm trees serving as great giant umbrellas shading the plentiful lounge chairs. The \u201cpalm tree umbrellas\u201d are unique to the Riu and make for a great alternative to the poolside \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll get one far enough away from the merengue and still close enough to take in the sounds of the breeze and the ocean. While most reviews for the food have been fair at best, my wife and I were actually pleasantly surprised by the quality and selection. Presentation is not necessarily their strength, but I would describe the food overall as \u201ctasty\u201d and sufficient. There aren\u2019t a lot of healthy options, but just enough to get you through each meal. The breakfast at Don Manolo is probably the best meal \u2013 we got their at 7:00am each morning and enjoyed the omeletes made to order, fresh fruit, excellent bread, delicious coffee, great guacamole, and friendly and attentive service. We enjoyed sitting outside, but had to dodge the smokers each morning. For lunch, we ate at Chilis, the outdoor restaurant near the pool. Again, you won\u2019t be blown away by the buffet presentation, but you will find a good salad bar and enough grilled fish and other healthy options to get by. Despite what others have said, I actually found the Mexican white wine and the champagne to be pretty good. I had a harder time finding a frozen specialty drink I liked as they were all too sweet, but if you are a drinker, you are really going to be impressed with the number of top shelf options available. As for the dinner options, people are right to complain about the resort\u2019s reservation policy and 6:30 and 8:45pm seating times, but we were able to eat at all the restaurants we wanted \u2013 and if you arrive a little later than your reservation time, it won\u2019t be a problem. Here is our take on the restaurants: Yashima Japanese: The sushi is not quite as good as you\u2019ll find in your local supermarket. Enough said. Agave Mexican: By far the best \u2013 the fish, the chicken, and shrimp dishes were all very good \u2013 and the salad bar offered a great selection of Mexican favorites \u2013 our waiter was excellent. We ate here twice. Krystal Fusion: For some reason, they haven\u2019t updated the d\u00e9cor from the former French restaurant \u2013 it\u2019s a little more formal \u2013 and the portions, as you would expect, are \u201cfusion small,\u201d but tasty. We both had the sea bass \u2013 worth a try. Chilis Steakhouse: It was nice to eat outside \u2013 and the steak was good, but the raw seafood platter and the side dishes were average at best. Don Manolo: Believe it or not, given the wide array of choices for the buffet and option to sit outside, you really can\u2019t go wrong with their main dining area. Their hard ice cream is surprisingly good! One night we did spend some time in the lobby bar \u2013 it\u2019s a little formal, but they play great piano music, and it\u2019s a good alternative to the music playing in the plaza. Each night they play a different type of music in the plaza \u2013 you would hope they would stick to local Mexican or Latin music, but you\u2019ll hear your fair share of Lionel Ritchie, Kenny G, and believe it or not, Pink Floyd and other depressing and out of place genres \u2013 the resort needs to work on this. We didn\u2019t stay up late enough to see any of the nighttime entertainment \u2013 but as I mentioned earlier, you\u2019ll be sure to hear it in your room at night! One of the nice things about the Riu resorts is that you can use the facilities at the other 5 locations which are all within walking distance. We spent an entire day at the Riu Palace Mexico and found the beach area to be more expansive and secluded and the pool area to be more laid back and quieter. We also utilized the Renova spa facilities and had lunch at \u201cEl Patio\u201d which was not quite as good as Chilis. Our overall sense was that the Palace Mexico had a slightly older and more relaxed atmosphere, which was closer to what we were looking for. We did take a walk through all the other Riu resorts and came to the conclusion that the Riviera Maya and the Palace Mexico were by far the nicest. We also decided to take a tour of the nearby Royal Hideaway resort that is part of the Leading Hotels of the World conglomerate. You can immediately tell this place is 5 star in terms of it\u2019s d\u00e9cor, layout, amenities, and services. A friend of ours had recommended the resort and if you\u2019re willing to spend an extra $2,000 for this level of service and tranquility, it is probably well worth it. Overall, for the money, the Riu is a good value and met our expectations of getting some relaxation for the week. But we found the incessant music and the novelty t-shirt and tattoo totting crowd took away from our experience just enough to make it a place we would not recommend to a friend. If you decide to stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, here are out best bets: 1. Get a deluxe room facing the courtyard on the upper 200 level toward the pool and ocean 2. Get up early and take a walk on the beach before 7:00am 3. Despite the windy and rough conditions of the water, take a swim in the ocean \u2013 the water is a lot warmer than you\u2019ll find in the pool 4. But if you do take a swim in the pool, try the fountain-like infinity pool 5. Take advantage of the underutilized Renova spa, including the heated Jacuzzi, the great shower facilities, and the massage on the beach 6. Take a 15 minute walk up the road to the Aviario Xaman Ha bird sanctuary where you\u2019ll see parrots, flamingos, and toucans, among many other beautiful birds 7. Spend a day at the Riu Palace Mexico where you\u2019ll find more tranquility, hammocks, and an additional Renova spa 8. Eat as much papaya, mango, and passion fruit as you can \u2013 it\u2019s delicious! 9. Try the hard ice cream, especially the chocolate and strawberry \u2013 it\u2019s surprisingly good 10. After each restaurant meal, take a walk back into the Don Manolo restaurant in case you want/need something more to eat", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, England", "Title": "\u201cBest holiday ever! would defo reccommend it\u201d", "Author": "Justmarriedlovedit", "ReviewID": "UR25701138", "Content": "We have just come back from 3 fantastic weeks honeymoon.

All we wanted was a relaxing vacation in a nice hotel with a nice pool area and by the beach. We also made sure to choose a hotel that had good restaurant reviews as we weren't willing to each bad buffet food for 7 days in a row. I surfed the web extensively before choosing this hotel and we were very happy with our choice! The hotel is well kept and even if the standard room that we stayed in was not luxurious, it didn't disappoint either. Having a balcony was great and the bathroom was relatively big and nice. We were also happy with the pool area and free cayaks and catamarans that were always available. We played tennis as well and the court was free most of the times when we wanted to play. We really liked the buffet restaurant! Believe it or not but it was actually better than the a la carte restaurants the hotel has (and we are not usually buffet eaters). I wouldn't recommed the Mexican restaurant at the hotel (I didn't like what I ordered but can't even remember what it was) but then again the Japanese restaurant was good. Still the best of all I think was the lunch buffet which is served by the ocean. Lovely location! And even after 7 days I wasn't fed up with the options as there were plenty of different courses and they rotated them daily. By the way, if you are a wine drinker (and know your wine), don't bother with the free wines they offer in the resort restaurants. The wines are not really good, and neither is the champagne (sparkling fine for you Europeans, definitely not from Champagne...). But hey, drinks were good, and you can always drink beer!

We have stayed at RIU Playacar 5 times, once to RIU Negril in Jamaica and wanted to try the Palace. I will give the good, and the bad and compare. Love the location, only 5 dollar cab to town. Walking distance to other riu properties. The beach at the palace maya was wonderful, not difficult to find a chair. The rooms at the palace were a little better, had a tub but only showered anyway so that didnt make much of a difference. They had a sofa and small sitting area that the playacar did not have, but that didnt matter much either. The one difference I noticed was the mattress was better at the palace, and the safe was electonic so we didnt have to carry a key around. I heard not all the mattresses had been updated though, and not everyone had a safe like that either. The booze was top shelf at the palace. The service was good, ran out of beer and they came right away with an 8 pack of dos equis on ice. That was nice. The lobby was on a much grander scale. The place did seem a little stuffy to me, but then the playacar could be a little too on the rowdy side, do oh well. They do have more restaurants but we did not eat at them even one time. The gourmet had stuff like pumpkin soup and beef with coconut foam. Did not sound too appetizing to my hubby who is a steak and potato kind of guy. The pool at the palace was so much larger than the one at the playacar, but for all of you arrogant sses who ignore the rules and lay towels on every chair by the pool and leave them there for hours I would really like to tell you what I think of how rude you are. The rules are posted not to do that, but not enforced. So unless you plan to be an arrogant ss and get there early to put towels on the chairs and then leave them there for hours, dont plan to sit near the pool. I really didnt want to sit near those types of people anyway and much preferred the beautiful ocean view so I had no problem. After too much sun, you can find a chair somewhere near the pool to relax. The food was surprisingly not as good in the buffet as it was at RIu playacar, I also found that the staff was more outgoing and friendly at the playacar, but maybe I just have been there enough to get to know them better. We did no excursions this time, just went to town and had a couple drinks at a bar that was fun. Most time spent just soaking up the sun and getting away from the cold here in Illinois. Here is the gross part. On the night before leaving I got up at 2 am and saw a cockroach on the bathroom wall. Then something hurridly scurried under the bed, looked like a centipede, but not sure it was so fast. I think the staff at the front desk was very nice and accomodating. I would stay again, but think I am ready to try a new place. The riu playacar seems to be going downhill a bit, my air conditioner did not work right and never was fixed when I was there in August, and the Palace did not really impress me as much as I thought it would. Maybe I am just tired tonight and crabby, it really is nice, and the beach and weather couldnt have been better. I am just ready to try something new next time. If you ae considering it you will love it I am sure. Take a lot of small bills and make sure to tip. The workers all deserve it and I dont see many who do tip.

The trip from the airport takes about 1 hour and there is really not much to see along the way, but overall it is not a bad ride. The hotel has a beautiful lobby, very clean and well kept, just not very tropical or something you would expect to find at a beach resort. My mother/father in law had purchased an upgraded suite which after spending 30 minutes trying to check in, the staff finally let them know they were overbooked and one would not be available for 3 days. So they stayed in the jr suite for 3 nights, then after persistent inquiries to the front desk, the staff moved them to a grande master suite for the last 3 nights. The hotel would not provide them a refund for the error, so that was frustrating having to move part of the way into the trip. Also, the 30-45 minute check in process upon arrival was exhausting after travelling all day. My biggest complaint is that you absolutely cannot sleep in there as the hallways are tile floors and each morning about 7:30am the housekeeping service sounded like they were running carts up and down the hallway. Plus the very large wooden doors to the room SLAM as you shut them so it is a combination of cleaning carts and slamming doors. My husband and I recommend brining ear plugs as they helped us get some rest. We ate at 5 restaurants on site and ate in Playa one night. The reservation process is a bit of a pain. You can only go make reservations between 12-3 for up to 2 restaurants at a time and usually there is a long line of people trying to make reservations for the restaurants on site since there is not a sharing program with the other Riu resorts which are within walking distance. The food at the restaurants was pretty good, about what you would expect to find on a cruise ship. The reservations are only available for either 6:30pm or 8:30pm, so you either eat early or late. We did try the room service as well. It comes very quick, but it was a big joke with our family what you would end up getting when you ordered room service. What I mean is that for a menu with only about 6-8 options on it total, it is amazing that when you order a veggie sandwich for example, they always bring you the club sandwich or when you order the cheesecake, same thing, club sandwich. Since there is a bit of a language barrier with the person receiving the orders, it would be good to just number the options so you know what you are getting. Also, providing room service is a bit misleading since there are so few things to choose from. The property is very long and narrow, more like a rectangle, so the beach front is at the front of the property and almost all of the rooms face the interior courtyard. I would not spend the money to get an upgraded suite as we have seen the jr suite all the way up to the grande master suite and really all you are paying for is a bigger room literally. It is not like at other all inclusive resorts where you would get butler service or preferred dinner reservations or some other upgrade for having a better room level (or a better room service menu for that matter). The hotel was immaculately clean. The grounds were very well kept and the beach had plenty of shade and places to lay in the sun. The staff was friendly overall and they did offer a full selection of drinks in the bar. The best drinks we found were the starter drinks at the restaurants (margaritas at the Mexican restaurant, Sangria at the steak place for example). I love champagne but theirs was not good at all, so I stuck to the mixed drinks. Overall I would recommend this hotel for the value. It is an easy vacation to plan, we enjoyed lounging on the beach and taking an excursion to the X-Carat and Mayan ruins. It is basically like a cruise on land.

It was the first time we had been to an all inclusive hotel and also first time to Mexico. First of all, the weather was great. We arrived on a cloudy day, had one other day of cloud (still 80oF though) and rain on 2 occasions (which didnt last 20 minutes and the sun came out afterwards), but the rest of the time it was hot and sunny. The evenings were warm and balmy as well. (Ladies just remember to take anti frizz hair products - the humidity really takes it toll at night on the barnet and you cant get much there) The beach is lovely, and the sand bags in the sea didnt effect the view in my opinion. At the end of the day, they need to be there or eventually there would be no beach at all!. Sand was white and clean. It was very windy down on the beach and the sea was quite choppy most of the time and with it, full of bits of seaweed, but fun if you like big waves. The pool area was very busy and we found most of the best spots for sun beds were taken very early in the morning. But if you like shade, there is no problem for a bed. The pool bar was very busy in the afternoon and quite noisy but not excessively so. The rooms were large and air conditioned and very comfortable. We didnt have the best view, but was quiet and we didnt spend alot of time in there anyway. If you ask though, reception will change your room where possible. Very clean and mini bar stocked nearly every day. You need to keep your air conditioning on 24 hours though otherwise the room becomes damp and begins to smell musty. The all inclusive deal was great! It was 24 hour and all food and drink was free. That included all local and imported brands. Baileys, Courvoisier Cognac, Gordons, Jim Beam, Absolut, Finlandia, etc etc etc. And of course several types of tequila. The only thing we didnt see was imported lager. And the shots are as big or as small as you like. There is a cocktail menu but if you have want something that isnt on there, they will make it no problem. For bar staff, they were all great but Pedro in the show bar was brill (try his crazy frog shot), as was Chano in the Lobby Bar and the very patient and kind Javier in the 24 hour sports bar who did the night shift. They will also make you something up if you cant decide. Although, as on any holiday all buffet food begins to taste the same, the food in the main restaurant was great. You can eat very well 24 hours! It was the best buffet i have have had ,although found the lunches better than the dinners. We did try one of the speciality restaurants but being a veggie we didnt try the steak house, or the japanese as it was fish based (but heard good reviews from other residents) Again staff in the restuarant were very good. I didnt really think the Maitre'd's did a fat lot apart from showing you a chair (and they didnt even do that towards the end of the holiday), but all the waiters were great. The majority of the holiday we had Russel as our waiter in the evenings and our glasses were never dry. The champagne i thought was very good. Evening entertainment was hit and miss. All entertainment finishes approx 11pm as there are rooms above the main stage. After that you have to go into Playa about 15 min walk away (albiet the clubs are very expensive - US$20 a shot in Coco Bongo apparently) or the Riu Tequila up the road if you want music, and dancing. Day entertainment is there if you want it but they dont push you. Again, the entertainment team worked very hard and were very pleasant. The British are minority as the majority are American and Canadian. Didnt see any loutish drunken behaviour and everybody we spoke to were very pleasant, chatty and just having a good time. Many seem regulars which is always a good sign. Tipping isnt compulsory but we did. Not sure if did make any difference to our service but it was the best we have had on any holiday. Also and very importantly we felt very safe. Walking around Playacar is safe and so are the main streets of Playa del Carmen. Did go on ferry to Cozumel which was a good day out as was the trip to Coba. Xcaret was ok but i didnt feel it was value for money. I heard good reviews about Xel Ha though. We do feel that we have been spoilt now at this hotel and wary about trying out other all inclusives in the future. But i do hear they have very good Rius in Jamaica, Cuba etc.....", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ticonderoga, New York", "Title": "\u201cStarted out rough but ended nicely....\u201d", "Author": "tarazan33", "ReviewID": "UR25006422", "Content": "We take a trip to an all inclusive resort in Feb. every year.

We arrived late Friday nigh at the RPRMt and recieve rooms that our group was not together or even on the same floor, our rooms were facing another resort and they put us in heavily smoked in rooms. I cleary stated to the public relations clerk previous to arrival that under NO circumstances can we have a smoking room because my husband is really allergic. When we went back to the front desk we were told they were booked, nothing they could do, come back in the AM and change my rooms.... Needless to say, my husband pretty much slept on the balcony, two minutes into the room and his head was clogged. We went back in the AM and they changed our rooms and this time we were right next door to one another and had non-smoking rooms:) The rooms are adequate but nothing special but how long are you in your room? Okay here is the good.... The beach was beautiful, I didn't mind the sand bags as others have criticized. It actually created little lagoons to wade in. Plenty of chairs at the beach but get one early by the pool. The pool was a great temp not too cool and refreshing. The food was great. The buffet Don Manolos was awesome, tons of selection, lines were none existent. Lunch by the beach at Chilis was nice as well. Chilis is also the steakhouse at night and that was really good too. The Japanese was great but DO NOT WASTE your time at the Brazilian.... YUCK. We left and went to the buffet afterwards. The bars were efficient and Marvin at the pool is Awesome. By the end of my stay, he had my drink ready for me before I even got to the bar. There is service by the pool which was good as well. By the restaurants, you can sit out at night and there is a band playing in the gazebo,the nightly shows were mediocre at best but entertaining. The location is good, about 5 minute cab ride to 5th ave. and 20 minutes if you walk. Overall, the experience was great.. The service was probably the best at out any resort I have been to.

FOOD - Very good with always an excellent variety. We only ate at 2 of the a la carte restaurants as it was very difficult to make it to the hotel lobby between noon and 3. The Brazilian restaurant was not very good. Chili's was better but nothing could beat the overall choices and accessiblity of the main buffet. POOL - Swim up bar was nice feature. The pool was quite cool and not very large considering other resorts we have stayed at. Plenty of loungers, but to get a spot in the sun did require \"saving\" a seat. ROOMS - Clean and well kept. We were in two rooms, the first on the main floor and then the 2nd. We did find cockroaches in our main floor room every day. Friends we were travelling with, who remained on the main floor during the entire 2 weeks, had roaches in their suitcases, in their books, clothes, hats etc. They were in room 0040. We moved to 2049 and had an excellent view of the pool and ocean - and no bugs! The rooms are a decent size. But the bathrooms could use a little reworking. The toilet sits right behind the door. The shower/tub is almost too high to step into, likely a challenge to folks of shorter stature. No in room internet - that is a deal breaker for us when we travel. We will not book any resort in the future without in room internet access. OCEAN - The beach has been severly eroaded by past hurricanes, but this beach appears to have survived in the best shape. The sand whales do seem to be doing the their job, but create hazards on their own. Out of the 2 weeks, only one day was yellow flag. On nearly every red flag day, the lifeguards had to rescue people who had ventured too far past the whales and were endangered of drowning. The resort is in easy walking distance to Playa del Carmen for great shopping and eating. Be sure to watch the sidewalks as they are very uneven and present tripping hazards. We went to Cozumel - warning to those prone to seasickness - take your Dramamine or Gravol. The ferry bounces and rolls for the entire trip. I nicknamed it the \"vomit comet\" considering that 1 of 5 passengers spent the trip with their heads in the bags provided by the ferry staff. Trip back was no better. If you are inclined, there is an awesome caving adventure that is quite new. Rio Secreto - it's 10 mins by taxi from the resort. What an incredible trip - it's an entirely underground river system that you walk, swim, crawl, scoot and crouch to get through. You are outfitted with wetsuits, life vests, helmets and lights - and you need them all. The cave surfaces are incredibly sharp. There are no lights or overhead openings, so if your headlamp isn't working, get it replaced. This is an adventure for those of decent physical fitness and not appropriate for those with claustrophobia. To exit the caves, you will be walking on your hands, floating your legs and bumping your head. But what an experience. The resort does not compare to Majestic Colonel in Punta Cana, facilities, room or beach. However, food, service and access to town certainly would set this resort aside from other 4 star rated resorts. Not a 5 star, I'd give it 4.2 because of beach (not their fault).

Before the trip, we read the reviews and felt ready for OK food and great service, but instead we got so much more. The place is far more beautiful & impressive than the pictures online and the food was delicious! We arrived quite late on Valentine's Day. It was after eight yet the front desk help were all smiles and handed us a much needed cold drink! We were quickly checked in. We got such a good price on this trip that we weren't expecting much with the room. The rooms are large with a living area and bed area. The bathrooms are huge. Our room faced a well groomed garden area. It was peaceful. We spent many an evening and morning relaxing on our deck. An ocean view would have cost so much more and we were happy with our quiet room. We enjoyed the pool and the beach. We never had trouble finding chairs. The entertainment crew kept everyone busy with activites. We also ate at each of the specialty restaurants except the brazilian. Each one has a theme. Chili's is a steak place on the beach. Norman at Chili's kept us laughing. My lobster was very flavorful. Don't expect a US steak, Mexican steak is not the same. The Japanese was a big surprise. All of the food tasted very well, except for the soy sauce. My favorite was the new Krystal fusion place. It was a true dining experience. Each course was a presentation. My sea bass was tasty and fresh! We also spent time in the sport bar playing pool and such. There are five other RIU properties within the Playacar area. You can walk to each and eat or hang out, but the prettiest is this one. We worked out one morning in the gym. There were two treadmills and a couple of bikes (not a whole lot!) so we ran in the mornings around the loop of Playacar. Also, Playa Del Carmen was a five minute walk from the hotel. We went one night into town for shopping and dinner. Another day we took the ferry over to Cozmel and spent the day on the beach snorkeling and eating, yum. The water was lovely. We also rented a car and drove to the ruins of Chichen Itza. It is easily a three hour drive there and a three hour drive back. The rental \"guy\" told us it was only one road to get there, not true! We had a tiny map to go by and after a few turns and round abouts, we arrived at the ruins. The ruins are amazing and very interesting to see up close. They no longer allow you to climb up the ruins, however they are very interesting to see. Yet, I loved the ride along the way because you see so much of the real Mexico. If you are brave, do it but get a detailed map! On the way back to our hotel from the ruins we took a ride futher south by Tulum (another ruin you shouldn't miss)! There is a quirky restaruant called Zamas right on the beach that you have to see at sunset! You sit under a thatched roof and watch the waves crash nearby. They have music there, as well. But the most incredible sight is when you walk back to your car from the restaurant. Look up at the sky and you will see billions of stars. Wonderful!

We stopped in Playa for a cruise and wanted to come back so we did. We decided on Rui Palace Riviera Maya because of the reviews here on Trip Adviser. Our review will compare past experiences with our cruises. Overall we felt it was much more relaxing than a cruise in that you were not rushing off and on the ship during port days. It was a much more inimate feel as nothing ever felt crowded. Except the daily early morning chair hogging/saving, which I admit we also took part in. Chair hoarding was much worst on a cruise ship. The most sought after chairs were at the pool and the over flow was the beach. Not a bad situation at all. The food IMO was much better here than any cruise I have been on. The Specialty restaurants we tryed were, Brazilian, Japenese, and the Steak House. I would compare these to a specialty restaurant on a cruise which you had to pay extra for. The major difference I saw was the fact dinner at these restaurants were only an hour compared to two hours on a cruise. We had no problem at all with that. The entertainment crew was great. We got to know several of them and always had a great time, dancing, horeshoes, darts, kyak racing in the pool(yes the pool is enormous) and just talking to them. We did tip and as stated in previous reviews they were recieved with sincere thankfullness. The main reason we chose Playa was for the location. We walked into town at least once a day. We loved the freshly squeezed orange juice and home made tacos from the food carts. Our one day trip other than walk to town was a trip to Akumel. We hired a driver for $100 US and had a great day snorkeling and visiting the lagoon (I forget the name of it). This was some of the best snorkeling I have seen. We saw large sea turtles, sting rays, barracuda and tons of fish. Just a warning to all. Be travel smart and watch you belongings at all times. While eating at a sports bar in town our friend had her wallet stolen. This put a damper on our night but not our trip. I am sure there could be thieves anywhere but we felt much safer in the resort.

I don't believe you'll be disappointed should you choose the RIU Palace Riviera Maya as your destination. Is it for everyone? Perhaps not. If you are a young single looking for a go-go atmosphere and frenetic activity this hotel may not be your first choice. However, for those looking for a quality resort property in a wonderful location with above average \"all inclusive\" food and drink this hotel may be a truly excellent selection. The property is very pleasing both visually and in its service levels. For those unfamiliar with the Playa del Carmen area the hotel itself is located in a gated community just south of the town. This community, known as Playacar has numerous hotels, condominiums, commercial and shopping areas contained within its borders. Security in Playacar seems to be very good. The RIU Palace Riviera Maya is located about a mile and a half south of the town of Playa del Carmen. Walking into town does not present any particular challenges as the land is flat and there are sidewalks. Should you choose to walk there are a number of Mayan archeological sites to be found along the route. If you're inclined to take a cab from the hotel to town it will cost 50 Pesos or $ 5.00 USD each way. Paying in Pesos will save you a little bit of money due to the Peso/Dollar exchange rate. The town of Playa del Carmen is certainly worth going into. The main pedestrian walkway of 5th Avenue has many shops, restaurants and boutique hotels. In the evening many of the restaurants have mariachi bands playing which may be enjoyed by those passing by. Prices at the shops in Playa del Carmen tend to be less than similar stores in Playacar. There are also several mega stores in town including a WalMart. The junior suites at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya represent well above average accomodations. Designed in a split level fashion the bedroom and bathroom are at the entry level and the sitting room and balcony are several steps below. I would estimate that the junior suite has in total about 480 square feet of room not including the balcony. Balconies vary in size depending on room location and building design. There is a good size clothes closet in the bedroom area and a large chest of drawers in the sitting area. There are also end tables with drawers on both sides of the bed for additional storage. One quirk in the junior suites, albeit minor, is that the television is located on the chest of drawers in the sitting area. The television does not swivel toward the sleeping area so if you're used to watching it from bed it presents a viewing angle problem. Bathrooms in the junior suites are large and contain double sinks and a Jacuzzi tub with european style shower. One caveat in the bathroom. Because the tub is very deep there is a rather high rise to step over in order to get into and out of same. There are assist bars in several places to aid entry and exit. Food and service is always important when staying at an \"all inclusive\" resort. Both are superior at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya. There are a wide range of restaurants at the hotel with reservations required at the \"specialty\" restaurants. These reservations may be made with relative ease but a little effort is required. The reservation desk is located in an area adjacent to the lobby bar and requires that someone go there between noon and 2 PM (approximately) to make specialty restaurant reservations for the next several evenings if desired. Specialty restaurant choices include a steak house, Japanese, Mexican, Brazilian and fusion venues. We ate at all but the Brazilian and found each to be excellent in quality of the food, service and ambiance. There is also a buffet restaurant which does not require reservations. It serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and is quite good insofar as food selection and variety are concerned. This restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating with the outdoor area overlooking the hotel's main plaza and fountains. Lunch is also served in a large structure near the pools. Here too the selection is good with both hot and cold choices available. This building serves as the steakhouse in the evening.

Food We ate at one of the specialty restaurant Chili's one night and enjoyed it, although my fourteen year old enjoyed the buffet more. The buffet food was always good and varied sufficiently that we didn't tire of it. Breakfast was always good too. Service All of the staff did as good a job at treating guests like royalty as is humanly possible whether we tipped or not. We tipped often and always received a genuine thank-you in return. The help was always friendly, attentive and energetic. Almost immediately empty glasses and plates were whisked away from our table (after being asked if we were done). We almost never waited for more than a couple of minutes before being asked if we would like another drink or refill no matter where we sat, except at the beach. We preferred walking up to the pool bar anyway to see every one having fun swimming, laughing, water aerobics or whatever. Grounds/Buildings The buildings were cleaned and maintained meticulously. The huge chandeliers never had so much as one bulb out and all of the areas were extremely clean and well kept. The bars and show hall were lavishly decorated and tables and chairs always perfectly straightened and clean. Gardens, lawns and walkways always well-groomed. Activities Xel-Ha for snorkeling and general all inclusive fun. We sailed, snorkeled, scuba dived, para-sailed, rode jet skis, played volley ball and swam all at the resort. A walk to fifth avenue to check out Senior Frogs is a tourist must just to experience the shop keepers and vendors vying for your business. Entertainment From water volleyball, then dancing on the beach with guests, then the nightly shows, the tireless animacion crew was great. Always happy faces, great personalities, providing all day fun. The team obviously enjoy their work and it showed. Great place, great staff, great time.

Our week went quickly and we met wonderful people from all over the world and fell in love with the resort - so much so, we didn't leave it until it was time to fly home. We'll be doing this vacation spot again for sure and for other locations, we'll be sourcing out the Riu Palace.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cNice and bad\u201d", "Author": "prolantis", "ReviewID": "UR24572202", "Content": "There are a lot of nice things about the hotel and at the same time, they could improve a lot of things as well.

Even though they had the record of their staff entering our room 4 times in less than 20 minutes and that person never returned to work, they offered us $100 which was fraction of what we lost. Receiving $100 meant that it was not their fault so, we declined it entirely. As for their food service, it's edible, not great, not bad.

In our group of friends, I am always the \"travel agent\" and I people trust me to find a great value! And that is exactly what we got here at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya. So here is my opinion in summary: SERVICE: The absolute BEST SERVICE I have ever had in my life!! I have been to five star hotels in the States and have been on 7 cruises with Princess, Royal Carribean and Celebrity. The service here blow them away! I did not expect it to be SO much better! Everyone was absolutely charming and inviting! Just had a blast here! But I cannot say the same for the other RIUs. There was a very noticeable difference from the RIUs Palace resorts and the other ones. I don't think I would stay at the other RIUs unless the price was crazy cheap and I was going to spend my time in town. FOOD: The food was EXCELLENT!!! This is what I was most surprised about! I didn't have high expectations. But I certainly will next time! The assortment was incredible! Really! RESORT GROUNDS: Wow, wow, wow!! The prettiest beach and the prettiest grounds of any that we walked by!! I mean by far. Even the swanky Royal Hideaway looked puny next to this place. Spotless!! The only negatives are the pool was quite cold in December. We stayed in the ocean. And the other negative is I did not see any lounge beds outdoors. But those are not very common anyway. I was not expecting them. Oh, and the whales that everyone grips about? PLEASE!!! They were a wonderful barrier to being swept out to sea on the rough sea days!! I actually prefer them. Some people! LOCATION: Again, it's a 10!! Very easy walk to Playa Del Carmen's main street, pleasant walk at that. And I love how you have to show your wristband upon re-entry. It made me feel more secure. SPIRITS: We were worried about the drinks being weak or having to chase down someone to get a drink or the alcohol being \"lower end.\" We were all very pleased with the alcohol. Don Julio tequila and Absolute vodka amongst others. And drinks being weak? Heck, they would bring you straight shots to go along with your cocktails if you even hint that is what you would like. But, trust me, you will get sick of all of the never-ending alcohol! ACCOMMODATIONS: This is the only area where I would say it is not a five star hotel. And they do not bill theirselves to be a five star, anyway. The rooms was immaculately clean. The room service was stellar!! Absolutely no problems. The shower/bath in the regular rooms is very large and so comfortable! In fact, the bathroom was my favorite place. The balconies are quite roomy. The downsides are probably true to all hotel rooms in the area. The aforementioned complaint of the musty smell is true. You will not smell it for the first two days. But after that, it does get a little old. We should have kept our door open more often though. And it was difficult to get the room temp the way I wanted it. It was either too cold, and I was curled up on the couch with a blanket or too humid. The bed is the most comfortable bed that I have had in Mexico, but that is not saying too much. But you won't have a problem sleeping. You just probably won't want to spend a whole lot of time in the rooms cuddling in bed. To my knowledge there were not movies on demand, you know, \"pay per view\" movies. So we watched a lot of weird television in Spanish. But that was kind of fun. So I would compare their rooms to, say, a Doubletree. Not a Westin. They were very very spacious, though! I would absolutely return!!! I would just go when it does not get dark out so early and the pools were warmer so I could spend less time in the room! Plus, the deal I got on this place was great! Five nights with air from San Francisco for two people, basic room, 1660 USD!!! I really don't know if you can beat that!!! We will be back!! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me and I will try to answer them!!

Also, in August when you are at Chichen Itza there is little shade so be prepared. Afterwards we had a mexican lunch at a restaurant and then went to a natural cenote to swim. Mayan Adventure tour was fun as well. This involved biking through a jungle area, zip-lining, and then swimming in the underground cenotes/caves. I have seen that lately there are sandbags in the water. I am a beach person and love taking pictures so I don't know how I feel about this new addition, but they say it's to prevent the beach from being completely ruined during the hurricanes and swept away.

We didn't use the bar, only drank the beer and water but from what a few people told us, they asked for special brands (Beefeaters Gin and some type of whiskey) and they were brought right up and put in the bar.

The service in the restaurants and the buffet couldn't have been better. We joked around with Fernando in the Brazilian restaurant and he was there to greet us every morning at the breakfast buffet.

The evening entertainment was typical most evenings, but the \"Grease Show\", \"Las Vegas Show\", \"MIchael Jackson\" and \"Crazy Show\" were really worth watching and the waiters and waitresses were very attentive there also.

This is only our second AI property we have been to. We previously stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico. We booked through Traveloni (Funjet) out of Detroit. We booked a non-stop transfer, not private, with Lomas; however, on the return we were the only passengers in a Lincoln Navigator! After experiencing that, we will definitely book a private next time. By the way, the Lomas Representatives were fantastic both when arriving in Cancun and departing. Very helpful, courteous and were safe drivers!! Check in was quick and efficient and we were placed in room 2086 which is a Superior Junior Suite. Our view was of the courtyard and fountains. The room was closer to the lobby than the beach which was fine with us. Our room had an extra large patio with two chairs and a small table where we had our morning coffee and our cocktails in the afternoon. I think all the rooms have a patio, but some are larger than others. My only disappointment in the room was that it had two beds pushed together rather than a real king, but we made do!!! We had room service most every morning for coffee and it was delivered within 10 minutes each time along with a long stemmed red rose!! We used room service other times to order additional cervezas which were also delivered promptly and with a smile! We had an occasion to call maintenance as our refrigerator was not keeping cold. They were there within 10 minutes. Can\u2019t ask for much more than that! The reservation system here for the restaurants could be improved. Waiting in line to make them seems silly to me. That being said, we had no trouble getting reservations to any of the restaurants when we wanted them. Reservations are taken from noon-3:00 in the piano bar. Before giving you our thoughts on the restaurants, I want to emphasize that we have never seen such excellent service from all the waiters, bussers, waitresses, etc.! You can drop a fork and before you even realize it, another one is in its place! This is true at the ala cartes AND the buffets. Service is top notch!! Okay, on to the restaurants: Krystal: We liked this one the best. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Try the pumpkin soup\u2026awesome! My husband had the filet and I had the Chilean sea bass which we both enjoyed. For dessert I had some chocolate thing like a warm brownie with chocolate sauce inside served with ice cream\u2026excellent! Agave: This is the Mexican restaurant. It is not real Mexican food if that\u2019s what you are looking for. I had the beef tenderloin and my husband had pork tenderloin. All of it was good, but it didn\u2019t have the ambience of Krystal. But again, the service was great! Chilis: This is the restaurant that serves lunch but turns into a steak house in the evening. I had lamb chops and I can\u2019t remember what my husband had, but the food was good. We loved eating lunch there everyday. Great selection and variety each day. Buffets: We ate at the dinner buffet 4 times and had wonderful food! The best buffet is on Thursdays which is the Gala. We had shrimp, lobster bisque, beef wellington, crab legs, lamb chops, etc. etc. There were wonderful desserts including a chocolate fountain! On Friday, there was a beach party where they served cocktails in the coconuts they cut down and had a buffet set up with spareribs, burgers, salads, etc. Very fun! They had a small band playing in the beach bar and games. We felt the beach was very nice. It had lots of shade if you needed it and lots of sun, too. The pool is incredible with lots of chairs and umbrellas. The sand whales did not bother us but we\u2019re not into swimming in the ocean anyway. There were few children here, but the entertainment staff kept them busy playing soccer, face painting and whatever else! I would say this resort is more geared to 30+ couples. There were some young people, but I bet they went to Riu Tequila or Playa Del Carmen in the evenings. There are a lot of European guests here and it is in their culture to sun bathe topless. If that bothers you or if worried about your children, I would say that they are very discreet and are not doing it to show off their bodies. The Europeans didn\u2019t bother us but there was one AMERICAN woman who paraded around topless in front of everyone and enjoyed the attention she received. We had a fabulous time and are already planning our return!

We arrived at the airport and we had one bag missing. The airline misplaced our bag. We panicked at first but the airline assured us they would find it at some point. Was not too reassuring but he gave us a number to call later that day to see if it had been located. Long story short, we called the airline 4 hours later and they found the bag. They delivered it to our Hotel so all was good. We then proceeded through customs which was a breeze. We went outside and located our transfers (which are included if you book direct through the RIU website). There was a clean comfortable van that took us straight to the hotel. The drive is about 45 minutes from the airport to hotel. Check in was a smooth effortless process. You are greeted with a cocktail as well. We went to our room 1058. GREAT room and wonderful view of the courtyard. The room has a safe for money, passports, etc. It was electronic so you do not have to carry the key. The mini bar is stocked with Corona, Soda, and plenty of bottled water. The bed was very comfortable. Not sure how anyone could say these beds are hard unless they just changed the mattress. We slept like babies. There is 24 hour room service as well. We always got our food in less than 20 minutes. The grounds at this hotel are absolutely beautiful. The landscaping is perfectly manicured and the beach is spectacular. The staff is friendly and will get anything you need. I can\u2019t say enough about the staff. There is a sports bar and lounge bar with all top shelf liquor. I drank my fair share of Don Julio. They have Modelo on tap if you get tired of Corona. They serve you drinks on the beach too! The buffets are actually really good. We ate at Chilies most of the time for lunch. We tried a few of the theme restaurants as well. The steakhouse was very tasty. The rib eye had great flavor. They start you out with an appetizer which has some king crab legs and cerveche. Very good! We also ate at the Japanese restaurant. This was our favorite. The Crystal restaurant was wonderful and highly recommend. Very classy. We did not try the Mexican or Brazilian because we heard from a lot of people that is was not all that good. Everyone has different tastes so try them if you like. We did a few excursions. We did the \u201cJungle Jims ATV\u201d excursion. You basically ride atv\u2019s through the jungle and have the opportunity to see monkeys and a lot of other wildlife. You walk through an underground cave which was pretty cool. My girlfriend got hit in the head by a fruit bat. Kind of funny but she didn\u2019t much care for it. You can also take a dip in the fresh water pond as well. Overall I would recommend this to anyone. About a 4 hour excursion. We booked this right at the hotel. My girlfriend also booked a swim with the Dolphins at the hotel. Delphinus is the name of the excursion and it was freaking awesome! She spent over an hour with the Dolphins and she actually got to ride them\u2026\u2026\u2026.unbelievable and highly recommend to anyone wanting to do this. Make sure you do the Delphinus tour. There are other dolphin swims that don\u2019t allow you to actually touch and ride them. The hotel is just a 5 minute cab ride to the famous 5th avenue. You have all the shopping you could want. Plenty of night life and the ferry to Cozumel is located there as well. We went out to the Blue Parrot bar on 5th avenue one night. They have a fire show that starts around 10:30 p.m. or so. Words can\u2019t describe this. I highly recommend you check it out. No cover charge and a fun place. I have been to the RIU Cancun and RIU Sant\u00e9 Fe in Cabo and this was by far the best RIU hotel. I wouldn\u2019t put too much weight in the negative reviews here.

I will never go back to this place again. We had requested a room with 2 separate beds while booking but were assigned a room with 1 king size bed. On request we were given room with 2 beds however, these were rooms at the very front near the restaurants. Please avoid the rooms at the front since every night the hotels generate a lot of noise (whistling and shouting staff, dishes being thrown around, etc). Apart from this the hotels clear their trash every night at 10 pm and a dump truck arrives and starts compacting trash just below rooms 1001 and 1002. For about 45 minutes every night you will have to endure this terrible noise. As I was told by the front desk manager Jose Luis Serrato, this is something that the city government decides and they have no control over this truck's schedule. That means, I would avoid the first 4-5 rooms closest to the elevator located at the front end of the property. Since the only elevators on this property are located near the front desk if you are in any room other than the first 10 closest to the front desk they are useless. The entertainment provided by the resort in the evenings is very lame. TV in the room has only a handful of english language channels, rest are spanish channels. There are no english language channels for the kids. Since you have to use cards to get towels, you are limited to one towel per person at any given time. We saw roaches on or near the buffet 2 out of 3 nights. Even though the choice of food in the buffet is very good, this is one choice I do not want. This is not something that they can fix just by spraying given the volume of food they serve. Processes and procedures need a change to fix this long term ... perhaps under different management! Good luck to anyone who decides to stay in this hotel. Pros: 1. Good location 2. Lots of beach space 3. Somewhat helpful staff at the restaurants Cons: 1. Attention to detail missing at Front Desk 2. Arrogant and callous front desk manager 3. Cleanliness should be improved 4. The elevators are only available at the front end of the property. 5. Shortage of towels 6.

We had arranged a trip partially through Apple Vacations and partially on our own. As we were preparing for our trip, we considered the new luggage fees implemented by Sun Country and other airlines ($15-$25 per bag, per flight) and decided that we would try to fit what we needed for the week into a carry on suitcase. Boy, was I doubtful! But, we did it! We have learned that we live in our swimsuits all day long and change into dinner clothes in the evening. A few mix and match dressy outfits was all we needed. Packing liquids was tricky. We needed to have all bottles be 3 ounces or less and they had to fit into 2 quart size baggies, one for each of us. Try finding sunscreen in small bottles! Walgreens! So, yes, we were successful with using carry ons only which made arriving in Cancun quick and easy. The flight was uneventful. Sun Country no longer serves a hot sandwich for free. Their service and friendliness was outstanding as always. We landed in Cancun 10 minutes early, collected our belongings, and made our way through immigration and customs. We were soon on our way to find our Apple transfers. Here's where it got bad. I know that there are time share people everywhere in Cancun. We were approached by a lady asking what transfer we were looking for. I told her Apple Vacations. She said to follow her and she would bring me to Apple. I protested and said no, I just want to find my Apple transfer. She said \"Ma'am, I need to confirm your transfer and will then bring you to the right Apple Vacations bus.\" Hesitantly, I followed her, sucked into her scheme for about 90 seconds before I got mad for her lying to me and walked away. Be careful! Once you clear customs, go straight outside! DO NOT stop until you get through the big doors and are outside. Avoid the podiums and desks at all costs. Once outside, we found the Apple reps, got in our shuttle and were on our way. We rode in a 12 passenger van, cool and comfortable. We arrived at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya within 45 minutes. Check in was quick and we were given a room, 2139, immediately, even though it was barely noon. Our room was a standard room, facing the outside of the hotel towards the Reef Playacar. The rooms at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya are junior suites. When you walk in the door, you enter into a foyer, which is your dressing area and has a large closet with electronic safe and bar area. The bar has the typical Riu liquor dispenser and fully stocked refrigerator. To the right is the bathroom, complete with a jetted tub and shower, double sinks, marble tiles and hairdryer. Further into the room is the bed (we had a king) with a new, slightly softer mattress. Riu beds are hard! But this one was better. Beyond the bed is a sunken living area with a sofa, coffee table, credenza and a flat screen TV. There are also patio doors leading out to a private balcony with outdoor chairs and a table. If we really tried hard we could see the ocean, making it \"oceanview.\" The grounds of the Riu are beautifully maintained. There are plenty of pool and beach chairs. You get a towel card to use and must check your towels in and out. Pool and beach waiters are everywhere. Don't forget to bring your travel mug or covered mug! The beach is split into an upper and lower beach. They are divided by a short wall, maybe 3 feet tall, and a white railing. We found that if we stayed up on top by the railing, we felt like we were on the ocean but weren't bothered by the beach vendors. Yes, there are huge beach sandbags, called whales, out in the water and along the beach, but this is to preserve the beach and bring it back after the past hurricane damage. These sandbags are found up and down the entire beach, not just in front of the Riu. We walked the beach all the way to the Riu Yucatan. It was nice the whole way. On the Riu map, it appears that the Riu hotels are side by side. This is not the case. Heading south from the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, you pass the Allegro Playacar, Viva Wyndham Azteca, Royal Hideaway, and the Viva Wyndham Maya before getting to the Riu Playacar, Riu Palace Mexico and Riu Yucatan. Directly across the street from the Riu Palace Mexico is the entrance to the Riu Tequila. When you walk north, there is only the Reef Playacar before you hit a residential area that you can't walk past. We walked up the 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen on day. It took us 18 minutes to walk. There is a sidewalk the whole way. The Riu is located in a gated, residential area, so it is very safe and clean. We could have taken a cab for $5, but opted to walk. 5th Avenue was great! It goes on and on, so be sure not to stop and buy the first thing you see. The pier is also right here if you want to take the ferry over to Cozumel. We stumbled upon even more shopping when we walked the road from the Riu Palace Riviera Maya to the Riu Palace Mexico. Right across the street is the Plaza Playacar Shopping Center. It is an outdoor shopping mall filled with little shops and street vendors. Everything we bought up on 5th Avenue could have been purchased right here. Both places were fun to see. We only ate at the buffets, and ordered room service once. There was always plenty to choose from. The service at the main buffet was outstanding. They were always there to full our glasses and pull out chairs for us. Very nice. Having a destination wedding at one of the Riu's? Check out myriuwedding.com for a ton of information. We met with the wedding coordinators while we were there and witnessed a beach wedding at the Riu Playacar. I was impressed with the coordinators. I'm uploading a few photos, but the rest are located at http://shellistravel.com/TravelogueViewer.aspx?N=Riviera%20Maya%20Mexico%202009&TI=P1100046.jpg&F=RivieraMayaMexico2009.

The hotel was magnificent, clean, and we had excellent service from the front desk to the maid. We stayed in the Jacuzzi Suite room number 2055, which had a great ocean view, we didn't find the beds to be hard at all (and we have a tempurpedic at home), the room was always clean (no bugs or smells as others experienced), and in a great location (right in the middle of the hotel layout). The food was great and always something different to eat. Each night has a different theme at the buffet. Don't quote me but I think Mon was Caribbean, Tue International, Wed Mexican, Thurs International, Friday Asian, Sat International and Sun International. We preferred the buffet over the specialty restaurants. We found it a bother to stand in line and wait to make dinner reservations when we could be at the beach so we only made reservations the first night (and you can only place two at a time). We did eat at the Steak House and Mexican which were both good but like I said we preferred the buffet. The pool is big but was rather cool. It was refreshing on a hot day but we liked the beach much better. The sandwhales weren't a problem for us. We felt Riu RM had one of the best beaches around. When you see how hard some of the hotel's beaches have been destroyed by the hurricane we were very happy with the beachfront we had. We had no problem finding a chair and we didn't wake up until 9-10am. The night time entertainment is on the down low. We are in our mid20's and it was fine with us, but we enjoy quite nights. They have some shows at night, live music, and some nights they have local shops set up. Overall I would say this is hotel is a great choice for families and couples wanting a quite getaway. Tip if you like Mexican cuisine: Eat at El Fogon across from the Mega mart 3-4 blocks off 5th avenue. Great food, great service, and CHEAP.

My husband and I came for 6 days at the end of January to Playa Del Carmen for a fun, kind of last minute getaway. I had been there previously in April 2008 for a girls trip and stayed at the Riu Tequila. For this trip, my husband and I were booked at the Riu Yucatan, but upon arrival were upgraded to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. Let me tell you, now that we've experienced the difference, we'd never stay at any other Riu in Playa. Here's what I think sets the RPRM apart: Service: This was by far the best part of staying here. The service is always with a smile. If you are friendly and interact with the staff, they will go out of their way to make sure you are happy. One of the biggest differences between here at the Yucatan or Tequila is that drinks are brought to you. Not a big deal, but I like to be catered to a bit on vacation. My husband and I both feel strongly about tipping--it's never necessary for bad service, but should be given to reward good service. Rooms: Lovely, clean. Bathroom door, which is nice, as the Tequila had only a curtain. Jacuzzi tub and shower is very nice. Sunken den area with a couch, coffee table and 30 inch Sony Bravia flatscreen tv with plenty of channels. General Facilities and Grounds: Sparkling clean. Comfy furniture. Entertainment: There's definitely something for everyone. During the day, there's water aerobics, beach and pool volleyball, spanish lessons, shooting contests, table tennis, etc. Plus you can get a free scuba lesson, take water kayaks, boogie boards, or a Hobie Cat out, all for free. (You've got to be a sailor in order to do take the Hobie out). During the evenings, we really enjoyed listening to the live music from the bandstand. We also enjoyed the shows, although maybe in a more ironic way when it comes to Grease. Food: Breakfast: This was the best meal. The pickiest of people can always find something. Lunch: This was a bit hit or miss, to be honest. The days when there was someone out making tacos to order were better. Dinner: We ate at the buffet only once but liked it--there was stone crab on the buffet, which was a nice treat even though it had been previously frozen. We also ate at the Japanese and Krystal--both were not really better than what you can get on the buffet. Town: We love the town. It's so much fun to grab a drink at the open air bars and then a nice dinner at one of the many nice choices. Tulum: This was the only excursion we did and enjoyed it. However since we booked last minute, we got put on a big tourist bus. Not our thing. But Tulum is very interesting and the beach is beautiful. Safety: We felt very safe here. Didn't feel like we had to watch our things like hawks while we were away from our beach or pool chairs. We also noticed that the couples with kids were able to give their kids some freedom, which hopefully made for a good vacation for everyone. Overall, only a couple of dislikes: Noise: Both at night and in the morning, sound really carries from the hallways outside your door. Especially with the staff's carts and with people going in or out of their rooms. Lunch: we got a little tired of the crowded lunch buffet, as we found people to be a little pushier than necessary during this time. My husband and I both felt that for the money, you can't do better than here. We loved it and would go back in a few weeks if we could. We give it a 4 out of 5 only because we've stayed at some resorts that are true 5's--but they were MUCH more expensive.", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, Ca", "Title": "\u201cLove Riu!!!\u201d", "Author": "Ewok20", "ReviewID": "UR23772853", "Content": "This was our first all inclusive and we loved it!!

There are many different varieties of food. The Japanese restaurant was okay but do not miss Asian night at the buffet. VERY good! The 2 pools are gigantic. One is an above ground and the other was an in-ground and you can jump from one to the other. The beach wasn't bad. Don't let the haters discourage you about it.

It was a fabulous vacation. Check in and check out were done in a matter of minutes. It took a day to learn the schedule of the hotel's dinning. They shut the buffet's down between meals but you can always grab a snack in the sport's bar. The buffet food was excellent. Lots of different things to choose from and they would specially make you something if you asked such as an omelet or speghetti. You needed to make reservations to eat at the main restaurants at least 2 days in advance but we never really knew what are plans were going to be so we only at 2 restaraunts. Both restaraunts were good but we prefered the buffets. Our room was always cleaned everyday with fresh towels and a restocked fridge. We had our own balcany but our view was the neighboring hotel. The bed was a huge king size that was rather hard so we struggled to sleep very well but that is just our personal opinion. The pool was great with a swim up bar and benches and tables to sit at in the pool. It was hard to get a pool chair because people got up early and claimed them with their towels. There are alot of palm trees around the pool so it is very shady. There were 2 levels of beach and it was nice soft sand and always plenty of lounge chairs. There is very minimal vendors walking the beach so that was nice. We parasailed from our beach through Scuba Caribe which is located right on the beach. It was awesome and only $55 a person. The service was great, they seat you at every restaraunt and bring drinks constantly. They had a show every night at 9:45 so we tried to stay up for those. They also had fun games at the pool during the day like volleyball, bingo, and water aerobics. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Playa Del Carmen shopping was only a 20 minute walk away or $10 taxi there and back. 5th Avenue had tons of shops and lots of places to eat. You could also take a ferry to Cozumel for the day but we didn't go. We booked an excursion to Tulum and Xel-Ha through a vendor at the 5th Ave shopping and we had a great time. There is lots of things to do around the resort and you can go to the other Riu hotels along the road and use their facilities and restaraunts for breakfast and lunch but they didn't supply towels.

It was also our first AI resort. Boy oh boy we were treated like royalties. Drinks, food, and entertainment at your disposal. Why Riu? Friends and coworkers have stayed here and gave rave reviews and we wanted our first trip to be memorable and wanted to try out AI resort. I've been reading good and bad reviews at TripAdvisor and been somewhat cautious on my expectations, but I was not disappointed at all. Transportation - Took ADO bus from Cancun airport (90 peso or 8 USD). Then then took a taxi (50 peso or 5 USD). We insisted on paying in pesos since we already withdraw the money from ATMs. We got 12.98 peso to 1 USD at the airport ATM. Very reasonable rate. Front Desk - I had previously emailed the resort requesting high floor room and easy access to the beach. We were accomodated. Arrived around 2pm. We got a Trainee to help us check in, and that took longer than expected because she couldn't find our reservation and thought we already checked in. The trainee did give us the towel cards and explained that it's $20 USD fine each if we lost it. When we arrived at our room, I realized that she didn't give us the keys to our room. Luckily there's a house keeping lady and got us to our room. Small glitch not a big deal. Next time I'll try to avoid any trainees I guess. Room - We booked a junior suite and got the 3rd floor, we could see the fountain below and the ocean to our far left. We got a King size bed (not pushed together) and no musty odor. The floor is a bit sticky for some reason. It seemed like it was just mopped, but we felt it didn't dry soon enough. We had to wear our sandals in our room most of the the time. Our room had a fan on the ceiling, Sony 27\" LCD TV, nice and spacious bathroom with hydromassage/jacuzzi tub. I would recommend bring your own toiletries. We weren't too impressed with what the hotel provided for a 5* resort. The towels were somewhat scruffy, even to my taste as a guy. You'll feel the difference especially after spending a whole day baking in the sun. House keeping cleaned up the room twice a day, during lunch time and dinner time (usually after 6.30pm). Mini Bar in the room include Smirnoff, Jose Cuervo, Bacardi, and coronas, sodas and water (very important). We didn't even get to try the mini bar liquor as we had enough drink throughout the resort already. Restaurant - We tried all the a la carte restaurants during our stay. Krystal (Fusion) would be #1 on our list as the head waiter (Johnny) is really nice and make us feel very special on our anniversary day. He even picked up some flowers and spread them around our table and later made us a heart shaped whipped cake with candles and fruits. Make friends with the head waiter as they could make things happen like Johnny did for us. He got us the seat at Chilis for a 7pm seating even though we didn't get a chance to make reservation ; ) Next on the list would be Chilis (Steak House) and Yashima (Japanese). Steak house because they have the surf and turf (mini lobster with beef tenderloin) and also king crab legs appetizer. Yashima - we had the beef and salmon both are pretty good. Although you can get the sushi appetizer at the Don Manolo buffet during Asian night theme. So check in advance. As far as the tempura, it was just okay, not the kind I'm used to. But very decent dessert for the tempura ice cream. Brazilian Rodizio has pretty good desserts selection, especially the coconut ice cream. The appetizer included corn cobs, potatoes, chicken wings, and broccoli in a skillet which was later flamed with tequila. Yeah you can really taste that tequila. I've been to many Brazilian restaurants before, but haven't had this kind of appetizer. For the meat skewer, pork and sausage are pretty good, but the beef was very salty. Mexican Agave has variety of deep fried appetizer. I had the mahi2 fish with some rice, wife had the beef and also some sort of rice. I really liked the rice. Probably should have tried the deep fried burritos. Of all the restaurants, we noticed that the Mexican restaurant is the easiest to get in without reservation. Try Krystal or Yashima first if you don't have reservation for 6.30pm and if you still can't get in then try the Mexican. The earlier you arrive, the earlier you will get served and thus finished earlier to enjoy the rest of the evening. Buffet - We ate there once for dinner, but wished we had tried it during the Asian night theme. The food is definitely abundant and has good variety for everyone. But it is a still a buffet. However, for lunch we prefer Don Manolo compared to Chilis. Service - Definitely very friendly and top notch. Once you are seated, someone will come and ask if you'd like a drink. We do tip at a la carte restaurants, but not so much during lunch time as we usually do not bring anything with us. Pool - Towel service is open at 7am and most likely you will find the sun soaked section reserved by the time you get there. There were some kids running around and jumping from the top pool to a lower pool, but still tolerable. Great pool scene though. Beach - There are two sections, the top section has lots of trees for shades and also some swing beds. The lower section is for serious beach bums like myself. We never have any problem getting the loungers. Probably because of the size of this resort. The sand whale actually helps prevent the rough sands and rocks on the beach. Every morning, there is a hotel staff that cleaned up the seaweed and the beach. I didn't notice too many cigarette butts on the beach though. But compared to other hotels, RPRM do have older crowds and more family oriented. Entertainment - We always find locals setting up stands right in front of the Don Manolo restaurant around the fountain. You will also find pilox painting of Chichen Itza, which we got for 20 USD or 250 peso. Apparently they are everywhere in downtown as well. We only watched two shows: Mayan Show and Grease. We really liked the Mayan show with all the cool feather costumes and fire play. We even got on stage to take some pictures with the cast. Downtown - You can actually take a FREE RIU shuttle from Riu Lupita (right next to RPRM). The shuttle runs every 30 minute at 15 and 45 past the hour. The last shuttle run at 6.45pm. It's basically a relatively small and white color shuttle bus (no marking of RIU at all). You essentially want to get of the shuttle at the first stop, which near the circle (round about) and walk 1 block to downtown PDC. It definitely saves us 20 min walking or 50 peso taxi ride. If you are lucky, you may catch one on your way back to the hotel, but we never did. Shopping - You just have to walk with a straight face if you are not interested in these street merchants. Some may get obnoxious, but that's all part of the fun in Mexico. You should get used to hearing \"Hey Sir! Sir! Give me 10 dollars... \" \"Taxi? Mayan Palace?\" We found a pretty nice and cheap selection of gifts near 5th and constituyentes ave. Sorry, can't remember the name. In the same area, we also got a 60 minute massage for 30 USD at Veronica's massage. It was a pretty nice, clean room with AC. We requested for female masseuse. There's a free banos (restroom) in the same building, right inside the cocoa place and walk to your left. Something that I didn't see too often, unless you plan to eat and dine at restaurants there. Lastly Excursions - Tulum & Hidden Worlds. Really loved Tulum, the beach and the wave is just awesome. Make sure you pack towels and swim suits. You can even grab some cold sandwich or hot dog from the sport bar before you leave. Hidden Worlds is also awesome. Very nice people, lets us do the zip line splash over and over again.

I slipped the clerk a $20 and she gave us a nice room on the second floor near the beach and pool and away we went. The rooms are very nice and spacious. All of the beds now have new mattresses and flat screen TV's. We found our bed to very comfy. The bathroom was probably one the of the nicer that we've had--nice jacuzzi/shower and plenty of space for your stuff. There is a sunken sitting area by the TV and a very roomy closet. We were very happy with our room. Only drawback is the key operated safe--kind of cumbersome. We had NO musty smell! The pool is nice-though a little chilly. But it felt good to get cooled off and also had a sobering effect (if you catch my drift) Marbin at the pool bar is excellent. We are in the habit of tipping for good service and these people really appreciate it and you'll get taken care of much quicker if you do. The bartenders and waiters even remember your name during your stay which is nice. We found the beach to be adequate. Not like the pre-hurricane days but still very nice. The sand whales are placed in such a way that they create a small 'bay' for calm swimming but you can easily get through them to the open water. Take some bread from the buffet and feed the fish--they will flock to you. We walked the beach to the south as far as you could go. RPRM is the nicest resort of them all by our judgement. We were glad that we didin't stay at the Riu Mexico. It did have a nice beach but everything else was just not laid out as well. The food was as good as any AI that we have been to. Daily buffet was good, if you can't find something that you like you are way too picky! Steak house was good-suprisingly good cuts of beef. Japonese was our favorite--good sushi. Crystal was also very nice. Don't forget your pants and a nice shirt-it is required although there were a few slummers who didn't abide by the rules (very tacky) The grounds and facilities are quite pristine and kept in good repair. I'm sure you can find faults but remember you are in Mexico. All in all we would definately recommend this property--you shouldn't be disappointed. Oh yeah.. you can walk to 5th avenue.

After leaving a tip for our cleaning lady she made beautiful sculptures with the towels which were very nice. We went on one excursion through Edventure Tours, the #1 rated thing to do under Tulum on here. It was absolutely the best part of our trip and I recommend checking out their review. The buffet was excellent but did get old after a while as it seemed as though little changed. The reservation restaurants were excellent, we enjoyed the presentation, service, and food. Our favorite was the Mexican. Drinks were always being offered and arrived quickly. The staff was always friendly and said \"hola\" every time you walked by. The pool was very nice and we never had a problem finding a place to sit. The prime spots did get reserved early in the morning. The beach was beautiful white sand, although the \"beached whales\" for erosion prevention were unsightly, they did allow much better wading and swimming on the windy days. One very nice thing about the Riu is being so close to both the city of Playa del Carmen and the end of the hotel area. We walked down south past all the hotels (2 miles maybe?) and felt as if we were on a new beach entirely. It was positively beautiful with jungle on one side and the ocean on the other. Well worth the walk and remember to take your camera. The town of Playa del Carmen was ok. We were not fans of the shop owners being aggressive trying to get you to come look at whatever they were offering, but it is Mexico. It was still worth going and seeing the different stores but we bought very little. If you get a chance get up in the morning for the sunrises. I saw three of the most beautiful sunrises on the beach of this property. I would absolutely recommend this resort to friends or family.", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing time at the Riu Palace\u201d", "Author": "TorontoJr", "ReviewID": "UR22970108", "Content": "We are a couple who stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya from December 15 until the 22nd. It was our first time at an all inclusive and we did have a fantastic time at this hotel. The food is good -- there is a wide selection of things to eat at the buffet, and every night is a different 'theme' so that the food isn't the same each day (during the day, the steakhouse is a buffet by the beach). The specialty restaurants which we tried, on the other hand, were mediocre at best. Chili's steakhouse served a steak of average taste and quality, yet the service and atmosphere more than made up for what was missing in terms of taste. It was a pleasure drinking San Gria and eating a plate full of seafood, while we waited for our entrees to arrive. The Mexican restaurant was my personal favourite. The burritas (though deep fried) were very good. They have a selection of appetizers that you go up and help yourself to, but for the most part, they are the same items that you can get at the buffet (mostly fried foods, see photo we posted for the mexican appetizer buffet spread). The Japanese restaurant was the least impressive of the three restaurants, yet the large plate of sushi was very good. I had chicken as an entree and it tasted like something I could whip up in 10 minutes, in a rush, when I'm at home. It was basically chicken smothered in a bottle of sweet chili sauce. Those are the only 3 speciality restaurants we tried (there is Krystal, which is more fine dining and people said was good, and the Brazilian steakhouse which others also raved about, but based on the menu, we figured we'd be just as happy eating at the buffet (i.e. different kinds of sausages and chicken breast or chicken leg). We typically didn't stay for the desserts at the dining restaurants, as we found they were identical to the desserts served at the buffets, except the presentation on the plate was nicer (the japanese had different desserts, such as fried icecream which wasn't at the buffets). We preferred to sample a little bit of each of the desserts at the buffet, rather than wait for one kind at the restaurant. The chocolate fountain with marshmallows at the buffet was excellent and a real treat each night! The diet pepsi (aka Pepsi Light) is out of this world! The white, sandy beach and the clear, blue water is absolutely stunning. There is ample shade available as well. There are hammocks on the one side of the beach (the man-made part) which are so relaxing to lay in with a pina colada in hand. No complaints. There are huge sand whales in the water, though they did not impact negatively on our experience at all. In fact, these sand whales seemed to break the waves, making swimming more pleasant. During the first half of our trip, the resort was not full at all, and it was very easy to get beach loungers by the pool or beach with little trouble at any times of the day. This was also true during the last half of the week, when the resort was at capacity, which was great as we had read other resorts where if you didn't \"reserve\" your spot early in the morning, you woulnd't have anywhere to lay. Our one concern was that, upon checkin, you are given a \"towel card\" in order to collect a beach towel each day. When you return each day, you get your card back. At the end of your stay, you return the cards. If you lose the cards, you pay $20US for a new one. We were concerned that if we left our towels around and went for a swim, the towels would be taken, but this never happened. The beach is wonderful, and the only \"bad\" thing about the beach is how guests treat it. There are cigarette butts everywhere, and oftentimes, guests will not bother to clean up after themselves (i.e. leave their empty glasses or bottles on the beach, expecting somebody to pick up after themselves). If you want to be picked up after because you feel that is what you paid for, at least leave your empty contents on one of the tables so that it is easily visible, rather than throwing it in the sand. The hotel is really beautiful, though I would not reccommend it for those wanting a romantic getaway. There were many obnoxious (and dare I say, sadistic) children running around who were rude to both staff and other guests while their parents looked on or were not around. When I say obnoxious, I am referring to such behaviours as being disrespectful of other guests in their attitudes and overt rudeness; when I say sadistic -- I saw groups of children throwing sand and things at birds; this was both in the outdoor lunch buffet restaurant and in the sea. While children do play, having to watch where one sits/stands/walks because one's bratty children are throwing sand is not fair to everyone else. Another kid was smacking the ping pong paddles against the table every time the other kid got a point, ruining the paddle. Another kid was throwing sticks around and hitting various people standing around the beach while his mother was playing the darts tournament. If you are a parent and plan on staying at any resort with your kids, please teach your kid some manners so that they don't ruin/annoy other guests vacation. The rooms were good, which the following exceptions. Some of the rooms (unfortunately, the one we stayed at), had an old-school lock-and-key safe rather than newer safes where you program in a code. Therefore, we had to carry a key around with you at all times, which is a bit of a pain when going swimming, unless you are comfortable with leaving your stuff by your chair. If you lose the key, there is a fine (i think $50 or $100). Another complaint would be the fact that the hallways are quite noisy (walls are thin). We were woken up in the early morning daily (6-7am) with either kids screaming in the hallways, or other vacationers wheeling their luggage to/from their rooms. Because the floors are concrete, you can really hear the wheels rolling and it is LOUD. There is a notice in the rooms to be respectful after 11pm and not make a noise in the hallways, but when groups of people come in from a night out late, they do tend to talk loudly to each other in the halls. Also, you can hear when neighbours (either beside or above you) are showering, in the washroom, etc etc. One neighbour either had food poisoning or drank too much, because we heard him vomitting while laying on our bed. Once again, if you are a parent, please tell your children to use their whispering voices until they are outdoors at least. This was quite a nuisance and did affect our experience as well. The last thing we suggest is - whenever you leave or enter your room, make sure the door is closed and locked. At least for our room, you had to give it a good pull in order to close it, as sometimes, we'd think the door was closed but it was actually a crack open. Also, when you leave your room, give the handle a pull and make sure it is locked, as it should lock automatically when closed. One time, we tried the door and it was still unlocked. The entertainment was consistently excellent on all levels. Our experience therefore is not \"excellent\" (five star) though it was better than average, making it a four star trip for us. Next time, we may try an adults only resort since we did find that many kids were extremely disrespectful, lacking in manners and appropriate behaviour. Yet, it must be stated that there were some very cute and well behaved kids as well. As you can see, the comments and criticisms above were either as a result of the hotel, or a result of the guests. Please do your part and treat the resort as you would your own home.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, MN", "Title": "\u201cWe made the best of it--not enough variety for us\u201d", "Author": "adbradley", "ReviewID": "UR22967850", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Riu for 5 nights and six days. We are in our mid 20s and are moderately active with medium to high expectations of a resort. Airport/travel: We flew NWA and had a direct flight from MSP airport\u2014I recommend this-its worth the extra money. Its about a 4 hour flight and then a 50 minute ride to the Riu\u2014that was kind of hard because we just wanted to be there already, but it was fine. The Mexican airport is nice\u2014as we were waiting to fly back home, we ate at margaritaville\u2014very expensive!!! We paid $35 for two hamburgers and fries and a bottle of water\u2014BRING LOTS OF SNACKS for the way there AND back!!!!! Staff: Very friendly\u2014always greet you with \u201chola!\u201d Always offering you a drink on the beach or in the restaurants. Deci was especially accommodating in the buffet and Krystal restaurant. Most of them speak English (with the exception of the housekeeping/maintenance staff we think) so you won\u2019t have to brush too much up on you Spanish. The entertainment staff weren\u2019t as enganging as the Sandlals resort in Montego Bay, but it was still fine. Keep in mind, Sandals Montego Bay, Jamaica is the only all-inclusive we have to compare to the Riu. Food: 5 nights was maybe a day or so long as we got sick of the food quickly. We liked the Japanese restaurant the best, but all the buffet food began to taste the same after a few meals. Breakfast was the only buffet we really enjoyed. The snacks in the sports bar were not good. Be sure to make reservations for the specialty restaurants between 12pm and 3pm\u2014you can make reservations for two days at a time even though the pamphlet only says one. Resort: The property is beautiful-lush vegetation, lots of lights, gorgeous lobby, etc. Well maintained grounds\u2026 Room: However, our room was very musty and each night that we went to bed, our sheets were damp. I know that going to Mexico is different than living in Minnesota, but when I pay for a five star hotel, I like to sleep on dry sheets. Our shower smelled musty and pretty gross all around, but our balcony was very nice. We were switched rooms on our first night there because our keys didn\u2019t work. We walked back and forth between the front desk and our room several times because our keys continued to not work. The manager was supposed to contact us about this and never did. We weren\u2019t able to get into our room on 6 separate occasions. And one other note\u2026we still can\u2019t get the smell out of our clothes, suitcases etc\u2026 Beach: Only okay\u2014the beaches in Jamaica are better. The huge sandbags really take away from the senery. We weren\u2019t able to participate in any water activities (snorkeling, kayaking, sailing etc. on the resort) because the yellow and red flags were out for caution and they didn\u2019t allow anyone to use their equipment if the caution flags were up. We had to go elsewhere and pay for activities (discussed below). Activities/Shopping/Shows: The only thing we got to do at the resort is boogy board in the ocean, lay on the beach, play bingo, swim, and go to the nightly shows. The shows were all musical and didn\u2019t really very from one night to the next. The only one we really enjoyed was the Michael Jackson show. We shopped at 5th avenue (walked there and took a taxi back\u2014I would recommend this) and at the Plaza mall located to the left of the resort about 2 blocks down. Shopping really isn\u2019t any cheaper that where we live so we only bought knock off sunglasses and a t-shirt. We booked an excursion right in our resort (I WOUD NOT RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS!!). We paid $139 per person to go on an all day excursion to Xel-ha (water park) and Tulum (Mayan Ruins). We found out later that you can get this same exact trip at the Plaza mall for $90 per person. We got taken for a ride by our resort which was disappointing, but you live and you learn. We enjoyed Xel-ha and would go there again if back in Mexico-it was a 45 minute drive from Rui, but it was all in all worth it. We got to snorkel, ride bike, jump off a cliff, see dolphins, and eat lunch. We didn\u2019t float on the tubes, scuba dive, or walk across the ropes, but it all looked fun. We went to Tulum on the same bus at 2pm and got to see the Mayan Ruins\u2014I would definitely recommend this. It is so gorgeous! The pictures we got are some of the best we took on the trip. Other: I don\u2019t plan to go back to this resort mostly because of the room and the food all tasted the same\u2014we like variety and we really didn\u2019t get it from this resort.

The hotel is magnificent and the staff is absolutely friendly and courteous. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30 pm from the airport. We were immediately greeted with drinks and though we arrived before the check in time of 3 pm, we were told that our room will be ready in 5min. Within no time we were whisked off to our room which was spacious and the bathroom had a jetted bathtub as stated in the room description. There was also a liquor dispenser in the room which we never found time to use much as there was always lots of alcohol served every time we went out. The resort itself is beautiful. The walls are decked with magnificent paintings and the ceilings have beautiful carvings. There are magnificent chandeliers in the lobby and the whole resort is artfully decorated. The main area of the resort which has fountains looks especially beautiful at night with the lights on. There are 2 pools and the main pool is really big and has a swim up bar. There are plenty of pool chairs around the main pool and the moment you take a seat you will have someone taking your drink order. The beach at the resort is also very big and beautiful with lots of beach chairs. Most of the reviews complain about the restaurant reservations. We never had a problem with this. You can make reservations for 2 nights at a time. You can do this between 12 and 3 pm everyday. So the moment we checked in we made reservations for 2 of the restaurants. Some of the reviews complained about the drinks not being served enough. I think we were really sick of drinking by the end of our vacation. We tried almost all the cocktails in the menu and the drinks were never watered down. The moment you took a seat at any of the restaurants or bars, someone would immediately come over and take your drinks order. And the moment your glass was half empty you would again have someone asking you if you want more :-) We especially liked the food and the hospitality at this resort. The breakfast spread was the biggest one I had seen. They have something for everyone...and they are open till 10:30am for breakfast so even if you get up late you can always catch up on breakfast. The lunch buffet is also very good. They have a lot of variety but some of the items are repeated on most days during lunch. We did not eat at the buffet for dinner as we always had dinner reservations at the other restaurants. The first night we ate at the Mexican restaurant Agave. The food was really good and there was a huge spread for starters which we especially liked. The second night we ate at the Brazilian restaurant which was a fun experience. The food again was magnificent. We also got to try the Japanese restaurant which again was very classy. We did not have a very good experience at the Chillie\u2019s restaurant however. The food was no doubt delicious but the service was rather slow. At all the other restaurants we were treated to excellent service so this one was a little bit of a let down. Apart from this, every night there was entertainment programmers organized. We enjoyed these lots, especially the Vegas night and the Mexican night. Overall, it was the best vacation we had. There was never a moment to complain. The resort is beautiful and the service staff is excellent. The food is delicious and drinks are plentiful and its total value for money. Don\u2019t go by the bad reviews you have read here.

We got a great deal on Orbitz, but I believe it is off season too. We arrived on time. The Cancun airport is very crowded and you have to go through another security check after getting your bags which took about 30-40 minutes. The hallway outside of where you get your bags is full of timeshare representatives. Walk right past them to the outside to get your transportation. We booked transportation on Orbitz (Grayline) for $90.00 round trip. It was a good deal, but we needed to wait over 30 minutes for the bus to come. It took about 50 minutes to get to the hotel from the airport. We were the first to get off the bus. Check in was very good. There was no line, and they did not even request a credit card. We had read about the hard mattresses on previous reviews. Our room was not ready though because they were replacing the mattresses in it when we arrived. So we had to wait a little while to get into our room, but the new mattress was very comfortable so it was worth it! The room was very nice. There is a musty smell throughout the room and the hotel. It is probably due to the climate. It may also be due to some furniture polish they use for the dark wood paneling as there is a lot of it in the hotel. One thing I would have liked in the room would be an electronic safe instead of the key type. The pool area was very nice, but the water was a bit cold. The beach water was warmer. There is less activity on the beach if you want some quiet time. There are not too many locals on the beach selling things like we have experienced in Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta. The sand whales do take a little away from the appearance of the beach. We walked down to the other Rius (Yucatan, Palace Mexico, and Playacar) and this Riu definitely has the nicest pool and beach area! I would rate the lunch and dinner buffett average. Breakfast buffett was good. Maybe I am just not a buffett person, so we booked all of the speciality restaurants. They were all excellent! Our favorite was the Fusion. We were able to book 2 nights at a time in the lobby area at 12 noon. Arrived at 11:55 and did not have to wait that long in line. We went into town one night for Mexican food and I think we actually had better food in the hotel! They really try very hard and service was excellent so we did feel good about tipping each night! We booked Tulum for a half day tour through an Orbitz representative (Tulum express) in the lobby for $90 for both of us. We left at 8:30 AM and was back at 1 PM. We enjoyed it, but it is hot and crowded. Went in the water at the beach there to cool off. It is a beautiful site and the tour guide was very good, so it was definitely worth it. The day we left our transportation was one hour late (you are supposed to get to the airport 3 hours before your flight). The lines to check in and the security lines were very long (about 45 minutes each), so we had only about 5 minutes left to shop (I had some pesos I wanted to spend) and then they were boarding the plane, but we could have missed our flight!

However, as the other reviews clearly state, this place isn't for everyone. Make sense? Keep reading. We took a belated honeymoon with two other couples, and all six of us had been to all-inclusive resorts in the past. A huge, all-inclusive resort in a third-world country dependent on tourism the way Mexico is is never going to be perfect. The RPRM is no exception. The beds are on the firm side (though we slept pretty well even without the \"mattress pad\" which we requested but never received), the food can be hit and miss, and there are various bad smells to be occasionally encountered in odd places (in the corridors, in the stage area of the large lounge where the dancers perform each night, etc.). This is an inexpensive, all-inclusive resort that is open 24-7, 365 days a year. I would imagine that these resorts tend to \"wear out\" before they can be thoroughly cleaned and redone. That said, I never found any part of the place to be dirty or even unsanitary. The rooms get musty in the humidity, but not to an unpleasant degree. There is plenty of bottled water, the buffet food is hot enough to stay safe and sheets and towels can be changed as frequently as you wish. The bathrooms are spotless. What RPRM has going for it first and foremost is service. Everyone from the front desk, to the chambermaids, to the waiters and bartenders are sincerely cheerful and thoroughly helpful. I have been to all-inclusive resorts and cruises in the Caribbean and Mediterranean, and the service at the RPRM blew them away. No attitude and tip-soliciting like Jamaica, just pleasant, genuine attention. I brought $60 in ones and fives to hand out in tips and ended up wishing I had brought twice that much. That said, no waiter, bartender or bellhop ever suggested, asked or waited for a tip from me. The waiters and waitresses there seem to work 12-hour shifts, too. We'd see them throughout the day, from morning until midnight. How they maintain that level of friendliness for that long is amazing. On your first morning there, expect a wake-up call from a man in the lobby wishing to confirm your transportation back to the Cancun airport. We had paid for a shuttle to and from the airport, so I was actually glad to hear from him so quickly, and he did make sure our return shuttle was booked and confirmed. The REAL reason for his call, though, was to sell us an \"excursion\". The lobby of each RIU Palace resort will feature several of these men, sitting on couches with binders of excursion brouchures in front of them in the mornings and early afternoons. They have a legitimate purpose in booking ground transportation for guests, but also receive commisions for booking snorkeling, parasailing, scuba diving, zipline and horseback riding trips for several area excursion companies. I booked a snorkeling trip for our party and was disappointed with it. We had to take a 75-minute van ride over the excrutiatingly bumpy roads of Playa de Carmen--dashing back into other resorts to pick up other passengers. The man who booked the trip for me, \"Manuel\" told me the trip to Puerto Morelos took 30 minutes. This is not true. It took us 45 minutes to get there via airport shuttle, and that was without making all the stops to pick up the passengers at other Playa resorts (stops that you will always make if you book an excursion, as the same trips are booked at all the resorts). Once we got there, the snorkeling boats were small, the water cold, and the reef scenery was disappointing. I've snorkeled all over the world and understand that reefs never look the way they do in the pictures, but the Palancar reef is particularly gray. It has been designated as a national park recently, and the guides were particularly careful to preserve it by requiring lifejackets (so snorkelers can't dive down and touch the coral) and biodegradable sunscreen. Perhaps under these new parameters, the reef will improve. I would advise booking only those excursions which leave from the beach at RPRM. There is parasailing, jet skiing and scuba diving to choose from. You can learn to scuba dive at the resort. Food at the RPRM is best I've had at an all-inclusive resort. Far better than what I ate at a far more expensive Sandals resort in Jamaica a year ago. The specialty restaurants (Japanese, Mexican, Brazilian, gourmet) book up very quickly, but we found the standby buffet, \"Manolo's\", had wonderful food. We would have been happy eating there every night, and we know good food. Late night, there are good hamburgers, odd looking hotdogs and bland nachos at the \"Sport Bar\" which is open all night. The beach is among the best in the Riveria Maya region. We walked almost a mile down from the RPRM through 10-15 other resorts, and didn't find a better stretch of sand than the one we had at our place. The water is wonderful, though sadly devoid of much sea life (lousy snorkeling). The door on our bedroom door would not always lock completely. I was concerned with this at first, but obviously didn't worried too much about it, as I never even called to have it fixed. We had put all of our valuables in the safe and it locked just fine. We never had a problem. Fridges are restocked every day (or more often if you wish) with Corona, soda and bottled waters. The hallways are very loud in the morning. Lots of marble tile and hardwood panels and zero rugs or carpeting will do that. I would advise bringing earplugs if you plan on sleeping in. An Ambien or some melatonin would also help you get better sleep. Overall, I would go back to the RPRM in a heartbeat. Cancun is very accessible to all parts of the U.S. (as there are many flights), the airport is nice and safe, the shuttles are reliable and every person I dealt with with friendly and helpful. I also felt that it was an exceptional value (I paid $2600 for a five-night stay for two people including airfare and shuttle service). My four-night trip to the Sandals in Jamaica would have been over five-grand. That's a no brainer.

I regret that I am compelled to recommend against visiting there, even though it is a pretty nice all-inclusive beach resort where, if you're lucky, you can enjoy a lovely vacation. Unfortunately, owing to the woeful state of security here, as well as to the indifference of the staff and management, one runs a significant risk of being unlucky, as was my family. Stated simply, a stay at this resort bears a real risk of its participants returning home with fewer belongings than those with which they originally departed. In the normal rhythm of a day at resorts such as this, one puts on a bathing suit and a coverup upon arising, and following breakfast, heads directly for the pool/beach area for most of the day. During those hours, guest rooms are serviced, as one would expect, but are mostly unsupervised. The hotel does provide a safe in each guest room for the protection of valuables, but these safes are miniscule, certainly inadequate for storage of tempting electronic items such as personal laptop computers, etc. The safes are not electronically keycoded, requiring that guests carry a manual key around all day and hope not to misplace it. The \"scam\" by which we were victimized works this way: When the staff enters one's room for servicing, the door to that room remains wide open at all times. Because several rooms are often being attended to simultaneously, a number of doors are left open at one time, so that any opportunistic individual can enter such a room at will. Generally unnoticed, he or she can then freely help himself or herself to whatever he or she wants. In our own case, incredibly enough, the maid who cleaned our rooms actually happened upon, and observed, or so she claimed, the burglary of my son's backpack, laptop, Blackberry, and other items. The man she claimed she witnessed perform this crime merely acted, she stated, as though he belonged there, and brazenly proceeded to remove a few unimportant things from the backpack to make more room, put the electronics he fancied in, and calmly walked out the door.....with the backpack. I have no way of knowing whether the chambermaid was \"in on\" this scam or not, whether the alleged burglar, of whom she offered a detailed description, was fictitious or not. I would like to believe that this person is honest, and made an understandable mistake. But, since all this took place when the hotel staff had our room doors wide open, and since the crime was allegedly witnessed by that staff, I have adopted what I think is the understandable posture that the hotel bears some responsibility for our loss, and that we should be compensated accordingly. We travel enough to know that hotels bear expressed limited liability from room theft, but, in our opinion, there exists a qualitative difference between a routine room burglary and one that occurs while the hotel staff renders one's room fully accessible. The hotel apparently sees this differently, and absolves itself of all responsibility beyond filing a police report. We were told that our complaint would be forwarded to Riu's \"Customer Services\" department for further action. I am skeptical as to whether or not such a department exists, or was invented on the spot to make us go away, but we certainly haven't even been rendered the courtesy of hearing from them, much less any more favorable action. This posting is being offered only to protet fellow travelers. While we can understand how, in innocence, a lapse on the part of possibly honest staff might be made, we cannot accept that the hotel management wishes to separate itself from any related responsibility. Our vacation was ruined, and wound up costing us a couple of thousand more than we thought it would. One might justifiably ask, where was the hotel's video surveillance during all of this? A good quetion, but, as we learned, this property has no video surveillance. So, while I don't wish to endorse criminal activity, if you are a potential hotel guest looking to upgrade your electronics, this is one place where you can do so with apparent impunity. If, on the other hand, you are honest, and just looking for a terrific beach vacation, there are lots of nice all-inclusive beach resorts in Playa del Carmen and you can do better than this one. Give it a pass, and try to find one with better security, unless you're willing to lug all of your nice stuff around with you wherever you go, to the beach, to the pool, to lunch, etc. That's a big price to pay for the kind of trip you're probably hoping for.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Holiday\u201d", "Author": "Saintsfan49", "ReviewID": "UR22247712", "Content": "We have just returned from a 2 week stay in this amazing hotel.

The beach was beautiful and good swimming, no seaweed on the beach and the water was warmer than the pool. The pool was huge and beautiful, but was cold and no one was swimming in it, even the swim up bar was empty daily, they do not heat the pool. That was my biggest dissapointment as I love to swim. The hotel is very clean, service is excellent in restaurants and at the bar. We had a few hiccups when we checked in as we asked for a quiet room when we made our reservation, and upon check in they put us in a room above the main theatre where the loud entertainment was held every night until 11pm. I requested a different room and they found us one the next day which was nice and quiet, but they failed to have the bellman move our bags from the old room so we had to go do it ourselves...not a big deal but inconvenient. We also asked for fresh bath towels 3 times one day and they never arrived. But I consider these things minor compared to our overall experience. Riu is a reliable chain, and a good value for the price. We will go back but probably in a couple years as all Riu Palaces are cookie cutter versions of each other, and we like a bit more variety.

The hotel itself is beautiful, and very well kept. The staff were all excellent, with nothing being too much trouble for any of them. The room was kept spotlessly clean, with clean towels every day, and most days towel sculptures left on the bed. Our mini bar was always fully stocked every day, and as a previous reviewer said, we had more beer when we left, than when we arrived!! With regards to the bed - we had no problems. We found the bed to be very comfortable, and we even got a new mattress after a few days!! The corridor could be noisy, but only occasionally when other inconsiderate guests decided they had to speak really loudly coming along the corridors. It wasn't really a problem! How anyone can say the food in this hotel is not good is beyond me. What do people want? The food here was excellent, and as far as I could see there was something for everyone. Okay lunctime could be a bit repetive, but after a huge breakfast, didn't really need to have lunch every day! We tried two of the a la carte restuarants - the Mexican and the Brazilian. The Mexican was really good, but the Brazilian wasn't really our cup of tea. People complain about the portions in these restuarants being too small - we thought they were about right. I can see how some might think so when you consider the amount of food piled onto plates in the buffet (and then left untouched). WE had not difficulties booking the a la carte restuarants. Went up at 12, stood in line for a bout 5 minutes, and booked for that same evening. There are TVs in every room with a good variety of programmes to watch. They are in the process of all being changed to plasma screens! Can't comment on evening entertainment as we didn't bother with this. My only problem with this hotel, was the beach. At first glance it looks great - even the sand bags don't detract. In fact they created quite a nice swimming area. However, on closer inspection, the beach was a bit grotty in places!! Why do smokers not use ashtrays instead of stubbing cigarettes out in the sand! I thought to start with ashtrays weren't available, but then I did see some guests with ashtrays so there really is no excuse for this! It really does make the beach look quite dirty when all around are fag ends!! There was also old straws, napkins, empty cups, and even broken glass on the beach! It really was a shame as it could have been a really lovely beach area if it wasn't for this. Okay there weren't alot of bins around, but if you walked a few yards you could find one to put your rubbish in! It it wasn't for this, I would have no hesitation in giving this hotel 5 stars. With regards to waiter service at the beach, this was available, but the only time we used it, we felt pressurised into tipping as one particular waiter made it obvious he wanted a tip by hanging around until we gave him one. Well, we thought why not, at least he will come back again - wrong!! We never saw him again until one day a member of the management team was hanging around the beach area, then he came to see if we wanted anything. I should point here, though, this was the only time in the two weeks we spent at the hotel, we felt we had to tip. At no other time did any waiter, or member of staff make us feel they were working for tips - quite the opposite in fact, and we left tips at the end of our stay for the good service we received. The area of Playacar where the hotel is located is a lovely area. We walked around it a couple of times - it is bigger than you think!! It took us just over an hour to walk around the area. Play del Carmen is a 15 minute walk away and is worth the walk - try to go early in the morning or in the early evening when it is not quite so hot! Anyway, would I go back here. Probably as apart from the beach area (the water was lovey by the way - could get a bit choppy though - and you could see fish swimming around your feet occasionally), we really liked this hotel and its location, and who knows maybe we were just unlucky with the beach.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel!

We have traveled alot and this all inclusive thing you can really get spoiled with. The hotel was beautiful! I felt like I was really living it up. The pools were beautiful and I didn't find them cold. How can you go wrong sipping on a pina colada in the pool jacuzzi! I never had a problem getting a lounge chair on the beach and when the sun is too hot you sit under palm trees and look at the aqua waters! People have said there is no beach there-I disagree. It is not a long stretch that goes for miles but there is a beach there and it was a blast to go in the water especially when it got windier the last few days of our stay. The waves crashed in and you could ride them. People, this is a gorgeous place. Don't believe the bad reviews. I found the hotel the best of all the Rius in the area. It was very clean. Our room was always promptly kept clean and stocked and we had little surprises of towel figures on our bed. I did not meet one staff member who didn't smile and say ohla or bend over backwards to please us. Our favorite meal was the steak house and the evening buffet. There was entertainement every night. The Mariachi night was the best. They had fake casino games one night and the staff were a hoot. A short $5 dollar taxi ride to Playa del carmen was fun. Just enjoy the people, the town is so much fun. I would recommend taking a side tour to Chichen Itza. It is something everyone should see. We booked with Apple Vacations and were very satisfied with their tour. It is a long day but our tour guide made it so much fun. We even got to see some of the Mayan villages on the way home. You will never complain again about life after you see how these people live. I guess I would describe this vacation as a cruise on the ground. You get food and drink anytime you want it without opening your wallet. You get the freedom to lay all day on the beach or take fun excursions without time restriants. You bond with the staff and fall in love with the wonderful people in the Riviera Maya. Don't take the little things so seriously.

We travelled with another couple, we are in our early 40's. All comments from other reviews regarding the high quality of service, hotel amenties, grounds and staff are shared by us. The food is exceptional, I can find no merit in anyones comments that they disliked the buffet food. There are numerous varieties, different international/country theme nights and simply there has to be something you like being prepared at every meal. I have read reviews were people have said there was nothing to eat. I am not sure what their diet is at home, but, there is plenty of quality dishes. I believe the odour is a fact of life in that area and no matter where you went on or off hotel grounds you occasionally smelt it, so what, when walking through any city in North America and/or out in the farm land/country, do you not get odours there as well? Only complaint would be against the rude guests. I cannot understand, how, if you choose to go down to the beach after dark for some fun, you would need to leave your drink glasses (not plastic, but real glass), garbage, tissues on the beach. Early morning walks would have the beach area littered with the previous nights escapades. There are ample garbage cans and tables right off the beach that one would think you could put your refuge in. The guests that choose to walk the beach, then ignore the mulitple fresh water showers to wash the sand off their feet also baffle me. There would be trails of sand all around the pool, right on into the doors and up the stairs into the main lobby. There are plenty of black plastic ashtrays all around that you can take to the beach, but, there would be people just using the beach as an ashtray or there would be crushed smokes on the walkways, several feet from an ashtray. The staff as others have said are constantly cleaning up, so they would always clean up after the rude ones and then back to general cleaning duties. People have written that the resort is not a five star. Well, they are wrong, it is in fact an excellent facility, we would not hesitate to reccommend it to anyone. If people continue to treat the place like a garbage dump, it will no doubt erode in time. The beach is fine, the sand whales as they are called are necessary. We stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico last year but due to the strong waves/minimal beach, swimming was tough. We walked down and saw that they are there now as well so I'm sure it helped out. The beach here is good for swimming. We walked and had a drink/lunch at the other area Riu's. This place was by far visually the nicest. Did the usual tourist things, parasailing, snorkling and used the personnel right attached to the beach infront of the hotel, all was worth the money. The tour guys set up in lobby, provide good insight as to area excursions. We did the Tulum Extreme, $96 per person. It is an 8-4 day, van ride to jungle, repelling, zip line, snorklin in a cavern, lunch provided, off to the ruins/beach. Good day overall. I canvassed other people offering the adventure during the stay and the price was always within 5-10 bucks of what we paid. So you can shop around but don't waste to much time. We haved stayed at the Riu Palace in Cabo San Lucas and as stated above the Palace Mexico and now this one. All worthwhile, but this one is a flagship. Unless you are the most critical hotel guest or a chronic complainer/whiner, then there is no reason why you would not have at least a very good time, but would suggest you would say excellent upon the completion of your stay.

The only issue I had with the hotel would have been the same issue I would have had with any hotel on the strip. I understand the beach erosion problems they have since hurricane Wilma, but the speed bumps in the water REALLY detracts from the scenic view. Once the sand returns it will be a geat place, but I'm not sure I wouldn't go elsewhere until it does. These \"speed bumps\" are all over the place and looks like beached whales from a distance and huge asphalt bumps up close. I would say the average size of these things are about seven feet wide and 40 feet long. Some parts of some are covered up but most are in full view. You won't see any pictures of this. There were around seven of these things in front of us in the water and they are BIG. I walked over a mile on the beach and probably saw at least 50 more of these huge asphalt looking barriers. Really took away from the beauty of the water. I understand the entire area has them now, or is getting them, including the beaches at Cancun.

The Riu Palace Riviera Palace Maya exceeded my expectations. My darling wife bought this 11 night holiday as a surprise present to celebrate my 50th Birthday. JOURNEY. Our journey started at Birmingham where we stayed overnight in a hotel to ensure our early check in at the airport. Eventually we found ourselves on a 2 hour bus trip to our plane as the Birmingham plane had developed a 'technical' fault and our replacement plane was in Bristol. Not to complain as I would rather that than, take off only to find ourselves plummeting into the Atlantic!! Nevertheless it was an addition to an already lengthy journey. Upon arrival at Cancun I and a fellow traveller found our padlocked cases had been 'investigated' somewhere en route, the padlocks being nowhere to be found. I had nothing removed as there was nothing of value in my case, sadly the othe case had jewellery removed so be warned about valuables in cases. On arrival the transfer was speedy taking the expected hour, the transfer was by mini bus and effortless not lifting one bag. Arrival at reception was also effortless and the staff fantastic as they realised (without being told as we were 5 hours late) we had been underway for some time ensuring check in was speedy. The hotel itself? The exterior and reception was pretty ruthless in it's attempt to create an impression as my jaw dropped and didn't lift again for a full 5 minutes. 'Palace' pretty much sums it up. THE ROOM? Clean and comfortable.......smell? Hhhhmmmmnnn...yes there was a faint odour....a mix of woodpolish, detergent and maybe damp but, hello people......these are the tropics...try avoiding it?!?!?! The Bahamas was worse. The aircon was pretty ruthless and, is probably mainly responsible for the smell...........but it is only faint and, well, surrounded by this level of luxury, who gave a damn anyway? Not us, the room was immaculate. If any of you really really want to complain........hit the spirits optics harder..........I'm sure enough Tequila will dull your sensory perception. (We visited the original Riu Palace 'Mexico' during our stay and were happier with our choice as the age mix was better aswell as the more modern facilities). The room fridge was topped up daily and, we even ended up with more beer than we started with astonishingly as beer was the one thing we didn't touch!!!!! An American couple who became friends had complained their mattress was hard, next day a new mattress was put in the room. As has been described elsewhere, mattress toppers are readily available on request. The hotel is very well cleaned/maintained and regularly upgraded as, one day we found our room had become home to a new LCD televison replacing what was already a good TV!! One warning, Mosquitos........my legs looked pretty bad after a couple of days..........when entering the room just beware of the flock of the little blighters around the exterior light which zoom into the room as soon as you open the door................the balcony at night is probably also not a great idea. But, the hotel 'mini mart' in the car park sells my new best friend.....'after bite'. DO NOT - EVER - switch off the AirCon, that WILL make the room damp!!!!! FOOD - Mediocre....is one comment I've read on here........NO WAY mediocre..........a more realistic description would be....Superb!!! It always worries me when our American friends bang on about food standards as, well, just TRY getting all inclusive in the States....the food MAY be of a higher standard in the US but, at a price. We tried all the A La Carte Restaurants (except the Brazilian) and, on personal tastes some would be better than others (Sir Oliver's/Krystall easily the best) but, all were really good quality!!! I personally wasn't over happy with the choice at Chilli's for lunch but, convenient for the beach/Pool it was. The food was always cooked to a high standard albeit I found the burgers to be a bit on the 'pink' side for my English tastes. There was always a fantastic choice on offer and, if someone wanted something other than what was on offer, I saw the chefs supply 'one off' dishes plenty of times personally delivered to the waiting diners!! FACILITIES - Don't dissappoint, we needed to iron clothing and, when we found the iron leaked, it was replaced within 10 minutes. Room service........superb..........first couple of days I was a complete pain in the butt, Jetlag causing my ordering of coffee to begin at 03:30am...............delivered to the room within 15 mins....staff...........too happy to have been real when greeted by my grumpy face peering out at them. Tried a room meal late in the holiday and it was superb. Another great thing was that, although check out is noon, the all inclusive only ends when you actually leave the hotel. STAFF - Can't say enough good things about the staff. The entertainments crew worked like troopers trying to motivate people into activities, they just seemed to go on and on until finally, the evening entertainment was over at 23:00 ish each evening. The Hotel staff all work a 10 hour split shift 6 days a week!!! So if anyone wants to complain about the hardworking and eternally cheerful staff.......think carefully about it. I have never, met such a cheerful, courteous, unflustered and generally friendly bunch of people in my life, I now feel like saying 'Hola' to everyone I meet. My special thanks go to Alfredo, Santos and Luis for, each evening ensuring my glass never seemed to get empty. How the hell they managed to remember what I was drinking I'll never know given how many people there were drinking!! Tips.......at no stage did we feel under pressure to provide tips.............the staff do not 'play for tips' either, it was more, a pleasure for me to give a tip on the odd occasions that I did. Note to the USA - STOP running around tipping everyone across the world....unless they deserve it. I saw Americans tipping barmen for doing NOTHING more than their jobs in the Bahama's then here in Mexico too, they have to serve you........they're stuck behind the damned bar!!! The waiters are the ones doing the running and, even then they are that quick they sometimes miss a tip because they're not still long enough. When, however they do receive a tip, they are most grateful but, if you guys keep throwing dollar bills at people it will become 'expected' and not a 'Tip'. You know this as that's exactly what already happens at home in the US and look where it's got the poor staff....decreased wages as tips take the place of your basic wage!! THINGS TO DO............... HOTEL BEACH........powder white sands, azure blue waters..............I'm going to cry if I carry on! Oh yes, the 'whales' to slow erosion, not a problem for us, they've weathered nicely into the surroundings, anyway, enough people were on them using them for diving practice to prove they weren't a problem to the majority. Once more, drinks service too but, not always to surf side unless you grabbed a passing waiter and bribed him to come that far from the poolside bar..........still, 20 pesos for about 8 to 10 visits, no problem. EVENING ENTERTAINMENT - great.............VERY professional but, I wish after the organised entertainment ended, they could have left a DJ on so we could have enjoyed a bit of a club dance!!! The walk to the neighbouring Riu for their disco was just too much effort that late at night. Excursions - shop around in the lobby and at the PlayaCar Plaza for best deals.........cheap is not always best especially for Chichen Itza which is a long day where you want the comforts of a good bus. Did XEL-HA...just had to....................so do you, really good albeit an obviously slick tourist machine when you're there. Did 'The Jungle Place' having read about it on TripAdvisor. There is no excursion so Reception booked us a taxi for $US130 for the day..................extremely good value as Roberto the driver fed us a wealth of info about life in Mexico. He didn't even get flustered when we found ourselves lost in the middle of the jungle having missed the entrance due to a large piece of machinery being parked across the gateway during the laying of new watermains. I would recommend this visit, Heidi and her husband Joel do excellent work here looking after their Spider Monkeys which are all orphaned/rescued and are unable to return to the wild. They don't want to have huge excursions to their site choosing instead to slot small parties by appointment only in as, the monkeys and their privacy come first. The taxi then took us to Tulum where he waited while we realised sadly, we should have chosen to take our swim gear as we stood numbly staring at one of the world's top ten beaches below us!!! Oh yes, the ruins were interesting too! Did Chicken pizz.....sorry, Chichen Itza having thought about the length of the day first.......glad we did as the site is awesome. Pity about the rows of vendors...........and our total lack of English prowess to haggle massive discounts with them. HAD TO DO - Senor Frog's in Playa Del Carmen....what a hoot............laugh? I nearly passed the cigarettes round!!(English joke). Oh yes, bought the T Shirts!!! Unfortunately, due to massive 'shot' intake at Senor Frog's that night, we missed saying goodbye to our American friends on their last night and, we slept through the departure of our last excursion the speedboat 'Fast blast' experience. Never mind, the beach was good enough!! So, having battered on at length...the summary Hotel, Fantastic. Staff, Fantastic. Facilities, Fantastic. Staff, Fantastic. Staff Effort, Fantastic. Food, Fantastic. Staff, Fantastic. Time, Fantastic. Staff, Fantastic. Friends, Fantastic, thanks to Rick and Ashley for becoming our 'friends from California'.

We had 32 guests attend and we all had a great time. The food was great, the size made it comfortable and intimate and it was very clean. I was concerned about the sand bags. Trust me this beach is breath taking. The sand bags look like rocks and can be climbed. They break waves further out so in my opinion they actually added to the beach. It was beautiful. The people are what really make this place paradise... all the staff and wedding coordinators were wonderful. They could not do enough for you. I had a hard time not knowing what to expect. I like to plan things out but once I met with the wedding coordinators I had no doubt that they would make it perfect ...and they did. A special thanks to Rebecca and Diana who made sure every detail of my overplanned wedding was perfect. I packed 3 suitcases worth of wedding decorations and welcome bags and the hotel set everything up with a smile. The DJ was worth the money and better than most in the states (Very advanced equipment, kept things rolling and had everyone dancing all night). The wedding was beyond my expectations.

This is a fabulous hotel and great value for money, definitely a great option for newly wed's like ourselves! We have been on several all-inclusive vacation all over the world, but this one I would definitely recommend! The hotel was ALWAYS clean and immaculate, with grounds keepers and hotel staff working around the clock tending to the gardens, sweeping up sand that had been dragged in from the beach and keeping it looking great! The activities staff also worked incredibly hard to provide entertainment around the clock, with games and fun activities during the day and shows every evening. The shows were great, we saw several and they are definitely worth checking out. Don't expect to see Broadway style productions but they did a fantastic job given the small stage they had to work with, and there is free table service too with the waiters constantly bringing you new drinks if you would like one, my glass was rarely empty before a new drink came round for me. If you partake in the activities or the evening performances I would encourage you to leave them a tip at the end (it's not expected for you to do so), they work really hard and probably don't earn much. Same for the bar staff in the lobby bar and at the pool bars, the service is very fast and the drinks are great quality with top shelf liquor, and they're very friendly! The room maids always kept the rooms in top shape too! We did not use the spa service but we did get a couples massage in town for about 600 pesos (about $50) total for both of us for an hour, it was great! 5th Avenue is a good place to look for these. 5th Ave is also a great place to do some shopping and take in a nice restaurant. Although the hotel is all-inclusive, we like to get out and about and try some of the local fare sometimes too. Speaking of restaurants at the hotel, check out the specialty restaurants they offer, they're great! The buffet was always good too, but their Mexican restaurant (Agave) was brilliant! The best of them though has to be Sir Oliver, fantastic meal in there, worthy of any major restaurant! You have to make reservations for these restaurants and they sell out fast so book as many as you can when you arrive. The beach was great as was the pool area and pool bar! There are several shaded areas too if you don't want to be right in the sun. We rented a car and took a day trip to Tulum, Cobo and Chichin Itza, it's the only way you can see all three in the same day and not get rushed. You can book organized tours to each place if you prefer (well worth going to see the ruins) so do that if you don't want the stress of driving yourself, although it was pretty easy to do that and very cost effective.

The hotel itself is luxurious, the rooms are very spacious and clean, and the lobby/bar areas are stunning.

We ate in the Japanese restaurant which was great, the Mexican restaurant which as good and \"La Oliver\" which was a Fusion restaurant with lovely food and very posh. The choice of restaurants was great as it gives you a varied dining experience. The \"Plaza\" with a live Mexican band was great - it was a shame when they finished and the usual hotal cabaret started at about 10 o'clock. The only slight disappoinment was the beach area. We did have the impression that this area was quieter but it was just one hotel after another. We did manage to find a quieter area but only after walking about a mile along the beach. So don't expect any secluded bays or beaches within easy walking distance. We went out on the cattamarans which was great (although the watersports people try their best to get you to pay for jet-skis or parasailing). The boats, body boards etc are all complimentary at the hotel. We didn't see anything of the 'real' Mexico. All the main attractions nearby did look a bit 'touristy' and other sites would mean a few hours travelling. Also, Playa del Carmen is a whole mile of shops and people trying to sell you things.

This was our fourth time at a Riu, but a first for a Riu Palace. We find some of the negatives posted by other reviewers hard to believe. The service from all the staff is second to none. Our room was spotless, as was the rest of the hotel whether it be the hotel buildings or the grounds, everything was immaculate. We tried all of the resturants, our favourite being the Japanese and Gourmet and had no problem with reserviations. Other nights, obviously, we used the buffet restaurant which fulfilled all of our needs. So much choice, I think if you do not find something to suit you must be an extremely fussy eater. Everything was cooked to perfection, and as with prevous stays at a Riu, have never had any tummy troubles. Excellent pools and clean beach, the \"whales\" are not a problem. Plenty of sun loungers both around the pool and on the beach. A few people would reserve loungers early on but we always found a suitable spot, although the hotel appeared to be only half full it may be a problem when full. I noticed on one review someone stated that the pool service was poor, but we did not find this to be the case, in fact the waiters around the pool worked incredibly hard and as soon as we had finished a drink a waiter would appear asking if you would like another. Same drinks service on an evening, Islas made superb cocktails etc. in the lobby bar. Again, a few reviews stated that drinks are weak, but we did not find this to be the case, if you like your drinks stronger you could always ask for an extra shot. Did not watch many of the shows at night but the ones we did were quite entertaining. Animation team work really hard, joined in a few of the games during the day and had a great time. Hired a car and drove to Chichen Itza one day. Set off about 7.00am arrived at about 10.00am had no problems getting there and back. We used the toll road 180, the journey was a bit boring but well worth it. Amazing place, although we had seen pictures on the internet beforehand, nothing prepares you for the size of El Castillo and all the other ruins. Be prepared to be pestered by the people selling their wares, they are all over the site. Also visited ruins at Tulum, smaller than Chichen Itza but well worth a visit. Make sure to take insect repellent, mozzies are rife. The only problem we had was with the fridge,on restocking it the door was left slightly open, therefore the ice box was solid. Reported this to reception and it was dealt with promptly.

Our stay at the RIU was excellent and I have ZERO complaints. We booked through a travel agent, who in turned went through Apple Vacations. I had checked reviews on the RIU for 2 months prior to our stay and found the 3 most common complaints were: Smell, Uncomfortable Mattresses and trying to get specialty restaurant reservations. Trust me, if you want to be nit-picky, you will find something to complain about no matter where you stay...the smell is nothing out of the ordinary for any resort in a climate like Mexico's. As someone else mentioned, you will have that smell no matter where you stay and believe me, that is true...as this was my 2nd trip to Mexico, different resort on the first trip. We didn't even notice the smell until we got home and smelled our clothes!! And, it will launder out of your clothes when you get home. We slept perfectly fine on the mattresses...however they did switch the mattresses out for brand-new ones two nights before we left. (They were doing this throughout the hotel). Getting reservations for us was NO problem AT ALL!! We ate everywhere except the Agave Mexican restaurant and everything was decent. If I were going to do it over again, I would pick two places I wanted to try and eat the buffet the remainder of the time because the buffet is excellent and you can dine when you want rather than trying to make a seating at a specialty place...which is usually either 6:30 or 8:30 each night. The service and friendliness of the staff is top-notch. EVERYONE is friendly, easy to communicate with, and eager to please. They are constantly working around the resort to make it impeccable. While we were there, they were even painting faded spots on the building (which were few and far between) and sprucing up the outdoor furniture. The nightly entertainment is completely entertaining and the staff work very hard to make it that way. No, it isn't broadway but no one should expect it to be!! The \"sand whales\" on the beach are not at all an eye-sore as some people will say and if you walk down the beach to resorts beside the RIU Palace, they are there too. As a matter of fact, we were glad they were there as the Red Flags were out our entire stay and they kept the waves from knocking you down everytime they hit. Had it not been for them, we couldn't possibly have enjoyed being in the ocean. Weather (although it was the supposed \"rainy season\" couldn't have been more pleasant. The only day we saw any rain was the day we arrived and it was in and out in no time. The rooms and hotel are beautiful! Rooms are very spacious, and not at all outdated as I had read. The place inside is truly like a Palace as the name suggests. We were very pleased w/decor and accents of the hotel and our rooms. And finally, Apple Vacations did a wonderful job (contrary to what I had read about them). They were waiting for us at the airport and had us to our hotel w/in 1 hour of our arrival. When we were picked up from the hotel to go to the airport, we rode in a brand new Suburban which was extremely nice. It was just my husband and I and they were right on time picking us up. As far as booking a trip, we did go through them and had zero problems. I do recommend meeting w/them when you get there b/c they will call your room and come by to remind you if you don't!

They do have sand whales along the beach due to damage from the storms but the swimming was still great. There were 2 areas to sit near the beach one level offered lot's of natural shade that is lined with palm trees. The lower level is for the sun lovers like we are. The grounds have a nice set up with it's gardens and fountains. It looks large but you can find most things near the main building like the lobby bar / 24hr sports bar / the bueffet restaurants and some a la cartes are just a few steps down along with the night entertainment area. The other wonderful feature is the courtyard with it's lamp posts and pavillion that provides live music everynight. It had a european feel to it.

The themed dinner night's also helped to change the variety of food as well. Lunch buffet is located near the pool area. This was good as well with lot's of variety.

He always had a smile and entertained the crowd no matter how busy it may have been. The drinks were always made just right. Some properties tend to overkill on the alcohol but Islas and the rest of the staff made them perfect. The staff was very hard working and were eager to please and kept the jokes flowing all week.

Me and my husband went here for our honeymoon this year, sept. 2008. I was so obsessed with getting on trip advisor and researching places before i picked somewhere to go for our honeymoon. Even my husband was like....just pick somewhere! But i wanted our honeymoon to be perfect. I had it narrowed down to a few places....the valentin, the coba, etc.....and i was so extremely happy that i choose riu rivieria maya!!!!!!!!!! We actually saw some of the resorts on our way to our resort because the bus that takes you to the resorts from the airport has to drop off other people to other resorts. I saw some of the resorts i was actually considering and boy was i glad when we drove up to the rivieria maya palace!!! Even the rest of the people left in the bus were like omg! It was definitly like a palace and from the moment you get there to the moment you leave you are treated like true royalty!!!! I have never been so impressed with anywhere in my whole life and i have been to a lot of places!!! It is a gorgeous paradise like resort that is beautiful inside and out!! From the floors and chandeliers, and the grounds, it was all so much to take in and look at! The grounds looked like something off of edward sissors hands as my husband said.....cuz the bushes and everything were so perfectly clipped and kept up. You always saw people cleaning and working. This place was the cleanest and most kept up place!Even my husband who doesn't get excited about much...was very impressed and excited. You just can't quit looking at everything. Ok but anyway and the rooms are also very clean and beautiful....just ask for a bed topper cuz the beds are hard.....but thats how they are everywhere but they had like these mattress topper, you have to ask for one, and it was much better! And they clean your room everyday and have turn down service if you want it. It is so awesome..you go down to the pool or beach and go back up to your room and it is spotless again. They also have 24 hour room service which was awesome...try the cheesecake and chicken tostados! So good! So thats about the rooms and we stayed in a junior suite and it was very nice. Its true that you really aren't in your room that much anyway. So cleanliness, 5 stars, rooms 5stars, and the food and bars, def 5 if not 10 stars! The food and bars are just extrodinary and awesome! There are two buffet style restaurants which you can eat at anytime for all meals. Then there are five restaurants which you make reservations for in the lobby, don't forget to do that betwn. 12-3pm. The restaurants are absolutely fabulous. I have never been or ate at anywhere like this. Best food we have ever had....we liked the mexican restaurant best and the brazilian. But they were all good and you are treated like absolute royalty!! Seriously! The staff waits on you hand and foot all day and night! Next the bars are awesome too! There were like 5 bars and all excellent. The pool bar was awesome and huge....along with the pool which was so awesome...the actual pool has these built in loungers on each end that we loved and then there was another pool that overflowed into the main pool and that was called the infinity pool! So AWESOME!!! Pool was immaculate! ten stars, if you can give that many! Beach was just as great as everything else! Beautiful white sands and the most aqua looking water i have ever seen. i have seen alot of oceans and this was the clearest, greenest, blue ocean i have ever seen i was very impressed. There are loungers everywhere and all you have to do is lay there cuz staff will come up to you and bring you whatever you want. Entertainment........5 stars.....i was so astounded at the staff at this resort.....they are constantly keeping you happy and treating you so well and friendly. They have daytime and nighttime entertainment everyday and it is so fun. They keep you entertained and if you don't want to be invovled then you just don't. It's perfect.......the nighttime entertainment takes place at the stage and nightly bar area outside....so awesome...its like something out of a movie! There is also a hammock area down by the beach that is heavenly and they have spa and massage areas but this costs extra! Nothing else does though. We checked out the other rius to see if we were missin anything....and not at all the riviera maya palace is by far the nicest of all of them!!!! You will not be disappointed i promise!!! There is one thing........whoever you book through will offer you expeditions the first day you get there in the huge lobby and i heard some are excellent but we went on the aquatic expedition and DON\"T DO IT!!! The mosqitos will eat you alive. It has nothing to do with the resort. It is seperate vendors that take you. But do not do it....go swim with dolphins or something. =) Well i know this was long.....but i figured after researching for so long..i owed it to trip advisor to put in a excellent review for this place because i can not say enough about it!!!

First the GOOD: -Beautiful hotel. No doubt best of all the Riu Palace's in that area. Everything looks new. Gardens are perfectly kept. The palm trees along the corridor from the lobby to the pool/beach are nothing short of paradisiacal. -The rooms are all large and very nice, even better if you get one facing the garden/pool area. -The main buffet was more than adequate for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The buffet at the Chili\u2019s restaurant by the beach was much better in our opinion for lunch. -Staff is very friendly, always saying \"Hola\". -The beach is beautiful with the exception of the sand whales. The beach has two main sitting areas, one near the water with no palm trees, full sun blast, and another sub level up one step where there are lots of palm trees and hammocks so you don't have to roast under the sun all day. -The pool was beautiful, we stayed away from it since we prefer the beach, and there was always this LOUD group of Americans hanging by the pool bar as if they owned it. -Older, couple-adult oriented resort. -Night shows are entertaining and fun to watch. Just keep in mind these are NOT professional cabaret-grade/Vegas shows. Now the BAD: -Lomas travel was our on-site agent and transportation provider to the hotel. They packed way too many drops enroute to our destination making our trip from the airport to the hotel over 2 hours long. We booked from Funjets, so if you use them, you will get Lomas Travel...unfortunately. -DO NOT book tours with Lomas Travel!! You will pay through your eyes, and second, if the weather is bad the day of the tour, they don't cancel, reschedule or refund. You paid for the tour, OH YOU WILL GET A TOUR even under torrential rain!! It's that \"take your money and run who cares about customer satisfaction\" mentality. This happened to us. We booked a tour to Tulun with them, and woke up to a rainy day. Throughout the trip, and at the ruins it was incessant torrential rain. When we got there, no rain gear was provided. They took us from the bus right into the rain. We had to hassle with street vendors for ponchos. All the tour guide had in mind was to sell us these over-priced Mayan pendants of our names stamped in the \"Mayan alphabet\" to fulfill his \"civil duties\" (his words), which we turned down. At the ruins, we had to walk a mile under the rain, and through an overflowing river of brown smelly water to get to the ruins. At this point we decided to abandon the tour and go back to the hotel. This was a $30 taxi ride. We ended up not seeing anything. When we tried to get our money back, we hit the typical Mexican trickery slippery wall of \"we are investigating the facts, we are gathering info, come back latter I should have an answer\" so forth and so on. After 3 days of asking, all we got was a refund for one person. They claim the tour provider said no one had left the tour! So there you go, we could've fallen off a cliff and no one would've found out we were missing, yet another reason NOT to book with Lomas Travel. Your best bet is to wait for a sunny day, take a walk down the beach, and book the tour for that day right then and there with one of the many guys you will see at the beach. It will be cheaper and under your own terms. -Hotel's lobby smells like a funeral home. No kidding. Not sure if it is all the antique furniture or the flowers on the lobby, but you can't escape it. Musty smell follows on the hallways and your room (and your clothes-typical of the tropics). -When we arrived at our room, first thing we saw was a guy's underwear on the bed, along with a suitcase and other personal belongings. This was obviously someone else's room still in use. We had to go back to the front desk. They didn't attempt to comp us for the unpleasant error, instead proceeded to give us a dungy room. We complained and after making it firmly clear we were NOT satisfied, we were upgraded to a nicer room with a balcony and a view of the garden/pool area. -Beds are rock solid. You can cough up a kidney if you don't ease your way onto them. We had emailed the staff in advanced about accommodations for a king bed and bed toppers, and neither of the two requests were honored. Safe in the new room was broken. Took a crew of 3 about 2 hours to get it fixed. -Floors in the halls are always slippery. This is normal in the tropics, but be aware because you will fall if you don't pay attention on how you walk. This is the same issue when you walk from the lobby to the buffet. -You CAN hear everything through the walls of the room. Everything! from people coughing/dropping stuff next room, walking on the hallway, talking outside the room. -Drinks are a mixed bag. They are mediocre at best. Many times we had to put them down after one zip. Don't even say the word wine! -The specialty restaurants are awful! specially the Brazilian-style one. We walked out after the Philippine sausage that smelled like dirty feet, and the turkey wrapped in bacon. We went right to the buffet. In our opinion, don't waste your time in line trying to get reservations to these restaurants. They limit you on what time you can have dinner, either 6:45pm or 8:45pm, and you WILL end up going to the buffet anyways. The stake house (Chilli's) by the beach was a little better, but don't expect Perry's style stakes. The ribeye stakes you grill on your backyard grill are way better. Besides, the same cuts are served at the buffet. Another thing, at Chilli's people are allowed to smoke, and you will come across the selfish rude \"individual\" of an \"unmentioned\" nationality next to you who decides because an ashtray is in site, it is ok to light up in the middle of you dinner. We had to move tables twice because of this. -Pool/beach towels after lunch are impossible to come by. Get your set early in the morning and never let go. They don't cycle the dirty towels fast enough. In many occasions we came back to the towel booth 3 times to get towels and we got the \"in 20 minutes\", back in 20 minutes we got the \"ran out\". Meanwhile you could see a mountain of dirty towels behind the booth. -The elusive site of waiters coming by the pool or beach area to take your drink orders is that, well elusive. You'll be lucky to get one round of drinks, so order up! -The people that sell the jetsky rides on the beach frequently rev up the engines and do pirouettes right near the entrance of the beach to call on the attention of tourists, so as a result you will get the pleasant nauseating intoxicating aroma of burnt diesel exhaust up your nose as you sunbathe on/near the sand. -This is more of a general observation- Buy Mexican Pesos at the airport. You will get a better rate ($13 to $1). In Playa del Carmen you will get $10 tops $11 to $1. Everything is open for negotiation if you go shopping. The faster you walk out of the place, the faster the prices drop. 5th ave is a nice area. Cabs are $5 each way. And there you have it. We are still not sure if we will ever return here. More likely try the Riu resort in Panama city. Use this review objectively to assume your own conclusions.

We had an excellent 6 night stay. Restaurants: We had planned to dine at all of the a la carte restaurants, but actually found the buffet far superior in quality and variety.The Japanese restaurant is the only one that we liked. The gourmet restaurant was awful and had ridiculously small portions. I am not a big eater and had to go to the buffet after we were done there. The Mexican Restaurant was bad a well. We luckily were VERY happy with the food at the buffet, for breakfast,lunch and dinner.The service was also excellent at the buffet restaurants. Room: We had a fountain view room on the 3rd floor with a small enclosed balcony, which was nice for privacy. We were in the main building which made it convenient for going down to the lobby to use our laptop that we brought. Make sure when you check in that you ask for a mattress topper for the bed.It made the hard bed really comfy. Beach: The beach was really nice and was very pretty with all the palm trees, which also provided plenty of shade for those who want it. There were also loungers set further down by the water for those who want full sunshine. The water was so warm, and we didn't find that the sandbag \"whales\" detracted in any way from enjoying the water. Pool: We only went in the pool a couple of times, once for water aerobics which was fun. The pool was really nice, we just preferred the beach where it was much quieter. If you like a lot of \"contests\" and fairly loud music, the pool area might be for you. Shows: We went to the shows every night and found them to be good. They were over by 11, which was plenty late enough for us. Gym: The gym was not that impressive. It was pretty small, with only 2 treadmills.We were told at the desk that it opened at 7, and for the most part it did, but 1 day we were there at 7 and it didn't open until 8. Also, no towels are provided, so bring the small one from your room. You might have to ask for antiseptic spray to wash the machine with. We didn't try any of the spa services since we found them to be expensive. Tip: The cab ride into town is just $5. If it is not to hot it would make a nice walk as well. If your luggage is lost (like our friends was), and you have reservations for one of the specialty restaurants, ask the head waiter for some pants. They will give you some elastic waisted \"one size fits all\" that you can pull on over your shorts.They are very strict about men wearing long pants in the restaurants.

My travel agent suggested looking at the Riviera Maya as it was warm, and far enough outside Cancun to avoid major crowds. She was right. This hotel is a few years old and is very well taken care of. As we pulled up the long driveway, we both had the look of shock on our faces thinking we hit the jackpot in terms of hotel.... We did. Other people I talked to staying at other RIU hotels kept coming to ours during the day to eat here because the food was much better (in terms of selection) and the pool was better. The place was great, the rooms were huge, the pool was great as was the food. The themed restaurants offered something for everyone. And the beach was great as well.... perfect sand. The weather could have been better as well, but we made the best of it. One small down side.. The ice machines in the hallways in the hotel stink. None of them worked when we were there... Funny thing is they look new!!!! So they need to work on that. One tip.... If you choose to book excursions, do not do it at the hotels. The agents at the hotel have to pay a 30% commission back to the hotel making your trips very expensive. We walked down the street to the Grey Line booth and saved $45 per head on a trip to the Mayan ruins. Also dont come here if you think you can play here by day and go to Cancun and party by night. Its over an hour away (in good traffic). Thats a $50 cab ride there and more coming home if the cabies try to screw you over at 3 a.m. If you want to party, go to Cancun. There is also some good night life 5 min from the hotel. We partied at PURE Nightclub for $35 for unlimited booze and cover. Well worth it!! Overall, this place is great. Go enjoy it!!

I thought the first stay was wonderful, but this was \u2018THE BEST VACATION EVER\u201d My wife and I took a 5 day get away for her birthday. We arrived on Wed. Oct. 15th to a wonderfully sunny 86 degree day. We could not have asked for more, but to top it off the next day, Thursday was even better. This was great because Thursday the 16th is my wife\u2019s birthday. We started the day with a walk of the property shortly after the sun rose (we are both early birds). We then had a wonderful breakfast at the buffet. We followed that with a walk on the beach and then resting on the beach chairs on the beach. We then took up residence by the pool for a couple of hours. The weather was gorgeous probably close to 90 with a cool Caribbean breeze coming from the beach. We then decided to go into downtown Playa Del Carmen. A $5 cab ride from the hotel puts you right in the heart of the shopping, restaurant district. It is called 5th Ave and it is wonderful, full of merchants selling their \u201cjunk\u201d as they call it and lined with all types of greenery, restaurants etc. There is also a public beach which is beautiful. You can catch a ferry across to Cozumel, if you want, for a couple of hours of shopping or site seeing. After a couple of hours in downtown Playa we return to our Palace. The Palace has several specialty restaurants, Steak, Brazilian, Japanese and Mexican. We ate at the Steak, Japanese and Brazilian. The steak house was our favorite. Overall food was good, but when you come to Mexico I would want to eat the Mexican food, since this is their specialty. (just my preference) On our way to dinner I informed the front desk it was my wife\u2019s birthday. When we returned from dinner the room was decorated with balloons, towel art and rose pedals on the bed. About 15 mins after we got to the room someone knocked on the door with a delivery of chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne. We Loved all the personal touches and service they gave us. The hotel in itself is a PALACE. The architect and attention to detail is awesome. The place is immaculate. (see the pictures) Our room was wonderful, but the view not all that great. As one of the other visitors mentioned the room was overlooking the hotel next door. It apparently over looked the kitchen so there was not much of a view from the balcony. Overall the Palace is a WONDERFUL RESORT for couples. I would not recommend it for parents with small children or teenagers as it appears to be geared toward couples. They do have a kids club but I did not see many children or notice any activities geared toward children. They do have live entertainment each night which was very good. Everyone was extremely friendly always speaking when you past them (hola). This was our BEST VACATION EVER and we will definitely stay at another RIU Palace and/or this one again.

Myself , my groom , and over 50 guests had an amazing time ! The Honeymoon was 10 days at the Riviera Maya and it was right on par with the Palace Mexico , although obviously newer and more updated . The rooms are fanstastic . Spacious , clean , no bugs , mosquitos, ants , nothing . Sure you will have a certain musty smell, but thats to be expected at any and every Beach front hotel that you stay at , regardless of where you go . Bring a travel candle , light it up , grab a Corona from your own personal fridge and chill and relax . In no time your room will be smelling great , you will have relaxed enough to be in vacation mode and let your adventures begin !! The maids come twice a day , first to clean your room and then again in the evening for the trun down service . They were outstanding . We left $1 or $2 every morning . Nothing was ever taken from our room , including my gold necklace that I carelessly left in the bathroom and cash left on the counter . My mother even said that my Papa left his wallet , passport and money all lying on his bed one night , and when the turn down service came while they were out , the maids just simply placed it neatly back at the top of his bed when they were done . You are of course given a lock for the safe in your room but we really didn't even need it . The grounds are incredible with beautiful landscaping . There are groundskeepers and staff constantly cleaning and looking after everything . The pool is amazing ! Just like the pictures . There is an infinity pool , and then there is a swim up bar , swim up tables , chairs and yes, even beds ! All this look sover the incredibly soft , sandy beach , with the beautiful warm torquoise water. Of course there is Sand whales , but understand that they have to be there in order to protect the beach from any further erosion . So much to do , parasailing , jet skiing , dance lessons , water games , volley ball ......or just order a nice frozen blender drink from one of the many waiters walking by , and grab a good book and lie in one of the many hammocks they have nestled amongst the palm tress . No joke ! Staff is constantly walking around seeing if you need a drink and that includes on the beach . These guys walk in the heat , in the sand , carrying trays of drinks ...thow them a buck or two will ya ? Buffet food was plenty , there is always something for everyone and it changes on a nightly basis . Including a Sushi Station ! The A'la Cartes were all really good but the one that stands out in my mind was the gourmet restaurant , it has a menu that says \" Krystal \" but the name of the restaurant is Sir Oliver , definately worth checking out . Every night there is a show , around 10pm for adults , it is like your typical resort animation crew show , but they work really hard , the outfits are great and they truly do entertain . I really have nothing negative to say about this place . From Hector the doorman , constantly greeting you and calling taxi's for you ( we went into town a few times ) $5 one way , so much fun , for nightlife and for shopping . * Tip * if you are into the club scene and/or want to get out and do some dancing, head into town and go to the Blue Parrot , its a great place and even has a dance floor right on the beach , it is incredible to be under the stars , with the Ocean in front of you , dancing the night away . So from Hector , to the staff , constantly cleaning , fixing , smiling , ...always saying \" Hola \" ...this place was great . I would go back without question !! Email me if you have any questions , I am always happy to help out my fellow Trip Advisor Members !! p..s . I have posted a long review of the Riu Palace Mexico so you can go there and see more info .

We did have to request to be changed to a different room at check-in since the one they offered overlooked the roof of the resort nextdoor.

The first guy who checked us in was totally unhelpful but luckily one of the women offered us an alternate room. The second room overlooked the fountain and was on the third floor with a small enclosed balcony. We found the food at the ala carte restaurants ot be inferior to the food on the buffet which was just great. We heard from others that they also preferred the buffet. The buffet was first class and offered items like Beef Wellinton, Frogs Legs, Lamb, Turkey, Fish and just about anything else you could want. The beach was GREAT and offered so many lounges that there was never a need to be there early. The pool was very nice but tended to be too noisey for us so we usually stayed at the beach. The gym was pretty nice but it was almost impossible to get them to furnish towels and a disinfectant spray for the equipment. The gym is operated by an outside company that also runs the spa so I guess that is why they aren't as easy to deal with as the hotel itself. After getting a topical rash on gym equipment in the Dominican Republic I now insist on being able to disinfect the equipment. The hotel should insist on better service for the gym clients as it relects on the hotel as well. The location of the hotel was great for us.

First of all, this hotel is by far the best all inclusive I've ever stayed. -There are a bunch of restaurants (which you have to make reservations for dinner which can be annoying), but the buffet is by far the best and no need for reservations there- the buffet has sooooooo many options, is a bit different each night so as to keep your favorites but also add new options, and there's a chocolate fountain (what's better than that?!) -The fridge is stocked with drinks, and there are premium bottles of liquor in your room -Everything is included- we would order room service anytime we were hungry, ask for bottles of wine, bottled beer, anything.

I have noted some of the positives and negatives below, although the negatives are nothing that would keep me from returning to this resort in the future, other than the fact that we may bring our kids back with us. This resort does have a kid's club, but I never saw it occupied and did not see any schedules of activities for kids. POSITIVES: - The service was fantastic. I had e-mailed the resort ahead of time to let them know that we were celebrating our anniversary and my birthday. I had asked for a room with a king size bed on the top floor. While I had booked a courtyard room, they ended up giving us an oceanfront room! I was very surprised. They wished us a Happy Anniversary upon check-in. That night, the maid left us a platter of chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of wine and a note wishing me a Happy Birthday! Drink and food service were wonderful with a few slight exceptions noted below. The bartenders never left you with an empty drink and always had a smile. Plates and ashtrays were cleared from the table as soon as you were done. Everyone that you met said \"Hola\" and were more than willing to help you with whatever you needed. - The food in the buffets was excellent. There was always a variety and different things to choose from each day. I have never seen so many fresh juices and condiments, sauces, etc.! All of the food was fresh and the temperature was good. My husband was more than happy to have dinner at the buffet every night. We only ate at 2 reservation restaurants, the Steakhouse and the Brazilion. The Steakhouse was OK and I did not care for the Brazilion. I think that we would have both preferred the buffet over these restaurants. I wanted to try the Asian, but we did not get a chance to go there. We did not try the room service, but it is great to have that option 24 hrs a day. - Our room was beautiful. Plenty of room to spread out. Large double sink and tub with shower. Large king-size bed and couch. - The pool was beautiful with plenty of loungers by the pool and other loungers with palm tree shade behind them. The Animacion Team worked very hard from early in the morning until late at night. There was always something to do. They even had free massage demonstrations by the pool one day that we were there. That was the only way that I could get my husband to try it with me! - While others have said that the beach was small, I had no problems with it whatsoever. While we did not walk all of the way down to RPM, we did walk down to Riu Playacar and I thought that RPRM's beach was much better than any others that we saw. One place had NO beach, only concrete that we had to try to maneuver around. The sandbags do take away from the beauty, but they are necessary and provided for very calm waters for swimming. The beach was very clean with no rocks at all. The upper beach is great for relaxing in the shade on a lounger or hammock. - We loved the 24 hour Sports Bar. We stopped by there most evenings for drinks and a snack and watched some football and baseball. It is nice to have this option for drinks and food at any time of the day. NEGATIVES: - While drink service at the pool was fantastic, drink service on the beach was nonexistent. I did see a waiter several times, and one time I ran him down and asked for a drink, but that was it. They need a bar or at least a large cooler of drinks down by the beach as it is a long uphill walk back to the pool bar. - There are no ventilation fans in the bathrooms. Getting ready for dinner was a very hot and sweaty ordeal in the bathroom after a shower. I felt like I needed another shower once I was ready to go out! - We were on our 4th day there before our mini-bar was restocked. And that was after 2 notes for the maids with tips and a request at the reception desk.

After reading many reviews of being served (weak drinks), we were sitting on the fence comptemplating wether to book or not. First of all they do make really weak drinks but here is the work around. If you are sitting in front of the bartender, he will give you anything that you ask for. For example we ask for a pina colada with a double dose of Bicardi rum.and thats what we get. if you give him a tip tell him you want to be on the automatic refill program. and he will usaully have the next drink sitting there before you even finish. If a waiter is bringing you a drink to your table or beach chair thats when you really get weak drinks. all you have to do is also ask for a shot or two on the side and add it to your drink yourself, and you cant go wrong. Also note: that there are full bottles in your room,, what we did was: fill and empty water bottle and carry it with us to spruce up our drinks. they will refill the bottle in your room when asked. Problem solved. On another note the service was superb at the whole resort. as soon as you take your last bite, the plate, ashtray, ect. is removed at once.

So if one of the specialty resturants do not meet your expetations just think of them as an apetizer, take a few steps away and hit the buffet.", "Date": "October 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolverhampton, UK", "Title": "\u201c5* Hotel - 5* Holiday\u201d", "Author": "K80_KLL", "ReviewID": "UR20830191", "Content": "***** WONDERFUL HOLIDAY ***** Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Riu Palace from 18 Sepember until 2 October and had a fantastic time. After having stayed at the Riu Palace Macao in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, the Riviera Maya had a lot to live up to and by no means did it let us down. On arrival and check-in at the hotel, all staff were warm and friendly, in fact we felt rather special when Hector the porter, made it clear to the check-in staff that we were Thomson guests. We were allocated our room and our luggage arrived approximately five minutes after us. The only criticism that I have, is that when we arrived in our room at the Macao there was a plate of fresh fruit and a bottle of champage waiting, but when it's 24 hour all inclusive you can forgive them. All of the staff across the hotel in general were extremely friendly and could not do enough for you. Even the maintenance and gardeners would not pass you without a 'Hola!'. All of the restaurants were superb - the buffet restaurant offered something to everyones tastes (take it from a picky eater) and the five speciality restaurants were just that - special. My favourite was either the Mexican or Japanese. But my boyfriends was probably the Steakhouse or the Brazilian. We both enjoyed Sir Oliver's gourmet restaurant however my boyfriend wasn't happy with the gourmet sized portions - no class I'm afraid!!!! After reading some of the other reports on here, we expected problems with making reservations for the restaurants, however did not experience any and could have easily booked to visit them more than once had we so wanted to. My little tip to anybody visiting soon though - make sure you go to Mexican night (wednesday) or Asian night (saturday) in the main buffet restaurant. There was always plenty of choice in the buffet restaurant for breakfast and evening meal (we only used Chilli's of a lunchtime). The fresh fruit was in abundance and there was never any food that looked as though it had been sat there for long. The waiters/waitresses were all warm and friendly, constantly topping up your drinks and cleaning plates away quickly and efficiently - just a tip though hold on to your cutlery even if you're only having a second or two between bites or else your plate will go and you'll have to start again! The bars at the hotel were also excellent. La Habana bar of an evening after a meal was lovely to enjoy a Kir Royal in luxury of air conditioning. My boyfriend really enjoyed the Sports Bar (I did for the internet access) however, I didn't like to spend too much time in there, due to the smoking - something that we are no longer used to in the UK. Our room was beautiful - right at the end of the hotel by Chilli's. The maids cleaned excellently and we often came back to our room of an evening to find the bed turned back, although not every night like the Macao. I can appreciate however that we were in a good position and would agree with some comments on here that I wouldn't have liked to be above either the theatre and bar or the sports bar! The only real noise we had was one evening when a wedding party was being privately held in Chilli's, however the disco finished by midnight! I can also agree with the musty smell, however when humidity is at 80% you have to expect some damp smell or even clothes feeling damp. This was nothing that wasn't fixed though by good old Persil as soon as back home! All back to normal now. The beach was beautiful - shame about the sand bags, but these are there for a reason and you soon see past them. The water is beautifully clean and warm - almost as good as a bath at home. (Speaking of baths, if you use the hydromassage tub in the bathroom, just make sure that the water is well above the jets or else as soon as you switch it on you will have water and soap suds everywhere like we did - ooopps!!!). We enjoyed spending time at the beach due to the breeze, although the drinks service was a liitle slower here. I hardly joined in any activities as I was on holiday to chill, however the other half had a go at Beach Volleyball, Pool Volleyball, Football, Rifle Shooting etc. He had a great time. At an extra cost, I do recommend the parasailing! One day we walked up to the Riu Palace Mexico for lunch. Whilst the beach had a bit more space there, the pool area and lunchtime restaurant was disappointing compared to our hotel. Away from the hotel, we ventured into Playa Del Carmen. Lots of shops including Diesel and jewellery shops to name but a few. Just make sure you haggle for jewellery - I knocked a silver ring from $120 to $45. Nice ring though! The perfume shop is slightly cheaper than that at the airport, but not by a great deal. And I must recommend a day trip to Xel-Ha! Whilst you're there, do Sea Trek - you'll see why! Overall a fabulous holiday and my biggest regret is that I got on the plane to come home! I have been to Cancun before but as a little commercialised would probably not stay there again, but I would definately return to Playacar and the Riu Palace Riviera Maya.

We are both in our early 40's, and have traveled to the Playa area numerous times. (as well as Jamaica, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, and the Dominican) We have stayed in lower budget AI resorts to the \"Ultra\" resorts (Sandals) This resort, by FAR, has every single one of our previous vacations beat by a long shot. (especially Sandals!!) Service, staff, cleanliness, overall appearance, food, room accomodations....all were fantastic. If there was something we wanted, or needed, it was taken care of. In stead of going into all the little details on everything, I wanted to add a few helpful hints for anyone staying here. Bugs: the only time I really encountered any bugs was when we ate at the steakhouse restaurant, as it is open air. Yep, brought the bug spray...nope, forgot to put it on. My legs were attacked! DO bring the bug spray and DO wear it if eating at this place. Lobby: the lobby area is a non smoking area. No ashtrays anywhere. Very nice, if you still want to hang out at night, but not put up with cigarette smoke. (there's a non-smoking bar in the lobby area as well.) We spent our time in the sports bar, as we're smokers. Had to watch the games on the tv, too! Room service: nice menu to choose from, if you ask me. The portions are good sized, so don't make the same mistake we did! Thought we'd each get a \"starter\" salad, and a club sandwich, and chocolate cake for desert. WOW!!! Full plate of lettuce with chicken strips; club sandwich was HUGE, and the rest of the plate was filled with potato chips, and the chocolate cake was the size of two normal slices put together. We had so much to eat, we could barely finish! The \"mildew\" smell: yes, it is there. And yes, you will take it home with you, and on everything you take with. Once home, I set the luggage outside, after spraying with some Febreeze, for a few hours. It seemed to help a lot. As for the laundry, I did a presoak with baking soda, then washed as normal with a little extra detergent. Worked great! Common sense: what I mean by this is, please; use common sense when it comes to how you act, and react to things. Men DO need to wear long pants at the specialty restaurants. We saw them turning people away because they weren't dressed accordingly. It clearly states the \"rules\" in the welcome book in your room. Also, if you feel the need to BELCH at the top of your lungs while eating (to the point where everyone stopped eating and looked) at least have the decency to say \"excuse me\"...not \"what??? I don't care!!\" (sorry, but that to me was rude) Pluses: a few of the nice touches I saw that this hotel offered while we were there. Nightly turn down service, which included fresh towels Bottles of wine sent to your room via room service Coffee POTS on your table for breakfast (I loved that!!) Pool and Beach wait service - these people ran thier butts off!! Plenty of bottled water (need more? the sports bar has some) I could go on and on, but I'd start babbling! We had a wonderful time, and I KNOW we will return to this Palace. (by the way, we did tour the other RIU hotels in the area...and know we made the right choice with the RIU Palace Riviera Maya) If I could change anything......only two very small things I would have liked to see. A venilation fan in the bathroom (which would also cut way down on the humidity in the room, hence the mildewy smell) And coffee pots in the room. I know we could've had room service bring us coffee each morning, but to me that seems like such a bother to these hard working people. Besides, we were in the restaurant for morning breakfast and coffee within five minutes from our room each day, so it wasn't a really big deal. GO TO THIS RESORT!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!

Beach-the water is the prettiest I have ever seen. There are tons of lounges, some in the sun and some under the palms. Food-loved it! We ate at the buffet the first night and were so impressed that we almost didn't try any of the a la carte resturants. The buffets have a huge selection. They did serve some things all the time but there were other things that changed daily. The breakfast buffet was repetitive, but the food was good. We tried three of the a la carte resturants. Chili's- was excellent, but don't forget bug spray. We got attacked by mosquitos while we were eating. This is the only resturant that is outside. Brazilian- very good. You get small portions of all kinds of different meat. I really enjoyed this because I have never had a meal like this. Sir Olivers-also very good. If you have a big appetite, you may not get full here. The servings are kind of small, but definitely delicious. The reservation process was not as bad as I thought, but that could be because of it being a slower month. Shopping-when you go left out of the resort, there is a small shopping complex very close by. Remember to bargain with everything!! We went to Cozumel to shop which I wouldn't recommend. The vendors there were way too pushy (annoying) We didn't get the chance to shop around 5th avenue but I wish I did that instead of taking the ferry to cozumel.

My boyfriend and I just got back from a sun-filled relaxing week at the RIU Palace Riviera Maya (Sept. 7-13). Upon reading review after review of people raving about this particular hotel, I had no reservations or hesitations about our vacation. But since I've been there, I have mixed feelings towards it. Let me start with the POSITIVES: -ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL hotel. Spotless, clean, neat and meticulous grounds. Staff is always cleaning and making sure the hotel looks its best. -The staff could not be more attentive and accommodating. Wether it was refilling your drink immediately after your last sip, answering questions, or taking a picture for you, everything was done with a smile. Every SINGLE employee we passed was sure to say HOLA with a big smile! -Housekeeping was really great. Never had a problem. Extra towels, turn-down service & the mattress pads for the bed did make a difference (just call housekeeping when you get into the room-they will bring you one to put on right away) -Amazing pool area. Always seats available in the sun or the shade. -Even more amazing was the beach and the crystal clear turquoise water. Although the \"sand whales\" were a little strange, they did their job of keeping the water calm as the water did get somewhat rough due to hurricane IKE. -Anything you wanted to drink you can get. ANYTHiNG! just ask! -There's a 24-hour small medical clinic on site if anything might happen during your stay. And now for the NEGATIVES: -An hour drive from Cancun airport. -We had to switch rooms at first because our air wasn't working right, not a problem at all. Upon arrival, we noticed a strange mildew-like odor. We thought it was just the room but it wasn't. Its actually just the smell f the hotel itself possibly from the extreme humidity. Believe me, you and all your belongings will retain this distinct smell and you will smell it when you get home in your luggage and your clothes. -The sheets always felt moist-very weird and somewhat disgusting. -The food was just not GOOD. My boyfriend will eat ANYTHING and enjoy it and he just did not enjoy anything. The buffets were okay for breakfast but consisted of the same food day in and day out. Nothing was spectacular. We met couples from other resorts that raved about their food but we could not do the same. The Mexican specialty restaurant, AGAVE, was decent. Thats about it. If your going to book the specialty restaurants-you can book everyday between 12-3, you can book two nights at a time and choose either a 6:30 or 8:45 sitting. -Lack of night-life. There were shows every night at 9:45-dancing numbers and some interactive games but thats about it. There's NOTHING to do after 10:00 pm. We were usually in bed by 11 pm. -I'm 22 & my boyfriend is 24-I would say we were probably the youngest people there. This hotel is more for older couples and honeymooners. -Many topless women on the beach-just a heads up if you plan on staying with children-you should stay by the pool then. THINGS YOU MUST DO! -Book excursions with OLYMPUS TOURS-reasonable prices, many excursions to choose from, highly knowledgeable staff: We went on two excursions-The first was TULUM EXTREME-it cost $96 per person and was worth every penny! It was from 8am-4pm...they took up to see Tulum for about and hour then we went rapelling, zip-lining (!!), and snorkeling in a cave. Awesome experience! Try to get NOEL for your guide. He was the man! We also booked the PARTY HOPPER for Friday night to go into Cancun. It costs $80 per person. Lasted from 8 pm to 4am. They take you into Cancun to 3 different clubs-Corona Bar to warm up-then off to SENOR FROGS and then to CITY. Alot of fun and a great way to party. Admission and open bar in all 3 places included in the price so you pay nothing while your there. Awesome! -GET OUT and EXPLORE! The RIU is located in the PLAYACAR complex which is like its own little town consisting of hotel after hotel along with condos and homes. Absolutely safe and very nice. We went out at night to go to the shops and felt very safe. -Go to 5th Avenue! A cab pulls right up to the door of the hotel and for $5 and 5 minutes, you are at 5th avenue with consists of about 15-20 blocks of shops, restaurants, and bars. So much to do and see! There is also a smaller area of shops within walking distance of the hotel. Just walk out and to your left about a half mile down the road they are on your right hand side (open till 10 pm). -Bring small bills. $1's for tipping-and just $20's and $50's to go shopping with-Its hard to get change of bigger bills. You can ask at the front desk but you will most likely get pesos as they don't really have US $ on hand. The peso is 10 to every $1 us dollar. So if something is 200 pesos-its $20 US dollars. Well, if you are booked at the RIU and anxiously awaiting your vacation like I was-you will have a good time. If you're researching hotels to book a future vacation-I recommend SOL MELIA resorts. They have all-inclusives all over the place and a much better overall experience. Also, a few people from the IBEROSTAR Tucan about four hotels down said that it was absolutely amazing-food was excellent and exotic animals throughout the grounds like a zoo. Look into that one.

So, please please take heed and take bug spray (even though we applied it) and take antihistamines of epinephrine with you. The hotel seems to change the sheets quite often in the day, but make sure you check the bed for bugs, literally. Oh and make sure you ask for mattress pad as the beds are rock hard!

Every morning they pool area was cleaned thoroughly. I got to watch them while I was running on the treadmill and noticed how detail oriented they were. The pool and pool bar was nice. Excellent would be a good way to describe the beach, pool side bar service, all service and personnel, food (and we had picky eaters and a 2 year old), rooms, room service, and the list could go on. We really have no complaints. Our group had two different types of rooms and they were both nice. We have stayed at other all inclusives and were disappointed by watered down drinks and poor food quality. We actually were disappointed eating in Playa de Carmen two nights and preferred to have stayed at the resort. The kids area was tiny. The pool was the size of a spa and a tiny swing set that the sun was beating down on the plastic. But, my daughter enjoyed the main pool area so much so it didn\u2019t matter. I was told entertainment at night was minimal but didn\u2019t experience it since we have a two year old. We went and checked out the other Riu resorts, including Mexico Palace and we liked our hotel the best. We were told by multiple people that our resort was the best so there was no reason to go anywhere else. You will pay a little more for this Riu Palace but it is worth it. I won\u2019t go to another all inclusive. Although tipping was included we tipped our room service, maid, and poolside bar service because they all did such a great job. Also, I thought I would be disappointed by the \u201cwhales\u201d in the ocean but I was actually surprised how much I wasn\u2019t bothered by it.

Tips were appreciated especially two dollar US bills. Mexicans consider it good luck. Joe provided GREAT beverage service around the pool area literally running our drinks to us in 100 degree (F) plus heat and humidity. Going into Playa was fun. Advise going very early in the a.m. or in the evening as the heat is too strong during mid-day. We had no problem making reservations at Krystal (Sir Oliver's) or the steak house or the Brazilian restaurant. Highly recommend Krystal and the steakhouse. Buffets are also great - NOT your typical buffet food. We found the price to be very reasonable for what you get, which is a lot. We did e-mail the hotel ahead of time and request a quiet room away from the bars and the shows and a mattress topper (like an egg crate on top of the mattress), both of which were accommodated. We went with two other couples and they thought they we in heaven. What a great time! Hotel does all their landscaping by hand so you do not hear hedge trimmers, lawn mowers or other distracting noises. We VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL. Incidentally, in the Cancun airport we ran into a honeymoon couple who stayed in one of the just opened Secrets hotels and said it was a disaster, undercooked food, toilets backed up everyone, stench in rooms, water leaking onto their clothes in closet, etc. etc .etc. - so bad they cut their honeymoon from 7 days down to 3.

I read many, many TripAdvisor ratings and was apprehensive, given several very negative remarks. However, we felt that although we could see where some of these reviewers were coming from, we were satisfied. We would probably not stay here again, but this is because we loved the town and would prefer to mix and mingle with the locals a bit more, even if only in the touristy areas. We found the hotel satisfactory, but much like staying in a hotel in the U.S. in some ways -- why travel outside the country and not see more of it? We knew this going in, however (it is an all-inclusive hotel, of course!), and I don't blame the Riu chain -- it was a lovely all-inclusive experience overall. I'm glad we got to stay at the resort. I felt spoiled and happy the whole time. Minor negative issues: -- Pool bar seemed very rushed, and was usually crowded. Not nearly as bad as I'd feared, but we didn't go there that often. It was great just for the novelty! -- Drinks made at the pool bar and hotel lobby bar were very weak and the margaritas were just odd -- like lime juice and ice. I'd think it was just me not knowing what a real margarita was like, but I had one in Playa and it was great. -- Occasionally table service at the lobby bar was quite slow. -- The ride from the airport was a little slow getting going, and the driver forgot to turn on the rear AC until we were almost there! -- They charge for printing in addition to Internet usage in the sports bar. The page I needed to print to get on the airplane (!) wouldn't print correctly and it took a good long while and many tries (ended up using Internet Explorer instead of Firefox) and printer jams. The guy tried to charge me for the extra time, but I pointed out (mostly in sign language) that it was due to their technical issues, and he didn't try to argue over it. If you're paying for printing, though, they should have that working a bit more smoothly. Positive issues: -- Polite service. No delay with room service or housekeeping requests, even though my Spanish is ... minimal and their English was sometimes only a little bit better. We were impressed by everyone's friendliness and willingness to help out. We left small tips for the maid and drink-provider every day. We didn't use the alcohol dispensers in the room as much as I'd planned! We did like having the beer in the fridge (Corona). -- The buffet was very good, if sort of generic. VERY extensive. We were only there for a short visit, and the one time I was able to get in line to get a restaurant reservation, none were available during our trip. I mentioned this to the woman taking reservations and she made an exception for us, which was much appreciated. We went to the Mexican restaurant, and the food was very good. It was more like fancy Mexican dining than a particularly authentic experience, but nothing to complain about. Excellent service from a very young, very helpful, very friendly waiter. The room service menu is limited but tasty, and it's hard to complain about limited room service in a place with so much to eat at all hours of the day! -- Absolutely lovely accommodations. The room was clean and did not smell at all that I noticed. The AC was very cold, and the ceiling fan helped chill the room nicely. The bed was hard, but I expected this. We never got around to asking for the foam mattress, but I slept very well without it. The bathroom was gorgeous; I wish it was here at home with me now. -- We had a garden view and loved it! Apparently we are in the minority, I realize. I was disappointed at first, until I saw the garden view. Yes, it was of another hotel. It was peaceful and the garden outside our patio well-manicured. I preferred this to having to listen to people marching by and screeching from the pool. I might have switched for an ocean view, but I liked our little terrace (with a convenient drying rack) and spent a lot of time sitting quietly and reading in the shade. I sound older than I am . . . ! -- I did not hear anyone in the room next door or hallway, which surprised me -- I am sort of picky about this. Maybe we just lucked out and it was mostly empty while we were there. -- The beach was excellent, even with the sand whales. The pool was startlingly warm -- I guess heated -- which I hadn't expected. It was also a shallow, hanging-out pool, not particularly my style, but definitely fun. Miscellaneous: -- The safe everyone has asked about is SMALL. Like wallet, phone, few small other items small. Not small laptop small. I have a really small Mac laptop and it wouldn't have fit in there -- I was glad I didn't bring it, even though I missed being able to use it. -- I recommend getting away from the hotel and taking a tour. -- We did not get any intestinal disorder. I'm mentioning so that you don't think you'll automatically get one. It sounds like you could still get one if you're careful, but it's not guaranteed either way! The hardest thing for me was not swallowing water in the shower. -- If you dress up a bit for the buffet, you'll be more comfortable. I packed several casual dresses and was comfortable at both the buffet and reserved restaurant seating. Some people wore very casual clothes to the buffet, and another example of me getting old prematurely is that I thought they looked like slobs next to everyone else. If you're staying at a fancier resort, dress up for it a little. I'm not at all sorry we stayed here, and I'm not sorry we started out in Mexico at an all-inclusive resort -- it was a good introduction to the area and a comfortable way to get familiar with our own preferences and travel style. I'd avoid any AI next time, but if you're considering them, this is a nice place. If I were doing the AI thing again, I'd return to this RIU. I'd also consider a more affordable RIU!

However, our experience was nothing to write home about. I have read numerous reviews on this hotel through TripAdvisor, and I thought I was in the clear, but this was not the case. When we checked in we were given a \"garden view\" which I would not recommend. This means you are either looking at a \"backyard\" with only grass, the neighboring hotels, or the water purification unit. Not really picture perfect. We came down to the front desk and asked for a different room, pool or ocean view, and were told to pay and additional $250 for the \"courtyard view\" or and additional $1250.00 for ocean. This is funny considering our travel agent told us we would have the \"run of the house\" which means to me that if there is a \"courtyard view\" avail then we can have it. That was the first issue. We paid the extra $250 and got the courtyard view. When we arrived at our room the lights would not work. After a call down to maintenence, it was about a 45 min wait (which seems to be the case for everything, room service, towel service, beverage service, etc.) The maintenence guy arrived, and spoke no english. He flipped a switch and sparks flew all over the bed from the ceiling fan above. We then had to wait an additional 2 hrs to get our lights fixed rather then having them move us to another room. The room smelled wet, and moldy. I looked up at the ceiling and above the door, there was black mold. Even with the air cond on, it still was damp. All of our clothes had to be washed, when we returned home, including our clean ones because they smelled so bad. Our travel agent failed to inform us of a dress code for the non buffet restaurants. Men, make sure you bring pants. However, these restaurants were in my opinion a lesser quality then the main buffet, which I liked a whole lot better. But the food in itself was not par with a upscale hotel. The \"entertainment staff\" I would relate to the staff in the movie Dirt Dancing. By this I mean totally cheesey!

I am a very frequent traveler and somewhat of a hotel \"snob\". If you are considering the Riu Palace Riveria Maya, don't let the negative reviews concern you too much - the resort is wonderful choice if you want AI, just be aware of a few things.... 1) Mattress - Yes, it is too hard for American standards. Get a mattress pad upon checking in. I promise, you will need it. It's not bad once you have it put on... 2) Bring at least $50 in singles (USD) for tipping. 3) The Playa Del Carmen area is an attraction for Europeans and S.Americans - women often go topless and men where speedos. 4) The service is great. 5) Don't purchase excursions from the beach vendors. Go with one of the vendors from the hotel lobby (Lomas Travel, etc.) They are more expensive, but much more organized and professional. 6) Buy antiacids and sunscreen in the US - dont plan on buying this kind of stuff in Mexico (Suncreen will run you about $30USD)! 7) The pool is very warm, so if you are looking for a refreshing dip - go to the ocean! 8) The pool and bars close at 8pm - very early. When booking your dinner reservations, choose the later dinner option so you have more daylight and pool time. 9) Sir Olivers is great; Chili's Steakhouse is pretty good; The Japense rest is very good and the Brazillian steakhouse is good as well. 10) My wife and I drank the hotel water/ice - we had no problems whatsoever. However, we used bottled water in the room when brushing our teeth (room water is not potable). 11) The sun is really strong - you need at least 30SPF unless you want to fry. - - - Oh, and by the way; if you do any outdoor tours (regardless of the time) - be careful, you will melt - No Joke! 12) English is a real barrier for the service staff - some of the reviews say \"I called and asked 3-4 times for this or that...\". More than likely the person didn't understand you. Be patient, they want to help so they can earn a tip! 13) When shopping - make sure you bargain! Start out at least 50% lower than the original price - don't budge and walk away if you have to. They will give in!! 14) The sand beach whales are ugly - but it slows the wave activity which makes it nice for swimming. It's not pretty, but it works. It's not that big a deal!

We won a free trip from Apple and I'm not a big vacation package / charter person so was expecting to not really enjoy it. That said, we had a great time!! The most annoying part of the trip was the flight on USA 3000 (I truly hate charters), but that's for another story. We decided to forego the free group transfer to the hotel and booked our own return transfer through USA Transfers for only $105. I would do that again in a heartbeat. We don't check luggage so we were speeding our way to the hotel while the rest of the resort-goers were still at the airport. I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel - it's very clean and all the staff is super-friendly. We got there at 11:50am and they had a room ready for us. Our trip included a garden room (looking onto other hotels), but we asked if we could upgrade and were given a courtyard room on the 3rd floor (which is only in the center part of the hotel) at no extra cost. Awesome! My other dealing with the front desk was to fax some statements to the US for a police report for a friend (car accident the week prior) and again they went out of their way to help and did it at no charge (thanks Fernel)! We were worried about booking dinners since we were only there for 3 nights. Upon getting our room number at checkin, my husband bee-lined it for the lineup (getting there at noon) and managed to book us into the Brazilian restaurant for that night (Thursday) and Sir Olivers for Saturday. No problem on Friday either, we got the Steakhouse for that night. Downside was there were only early seatings (we prefer later) but it's better than nothing! For the restaurants, here's my 2 cents: -Brazilian - It was ok. I'm not a huge meat-eater and have had churrascuria style food in Brazil so I'm being picky. -Steakhouse - Really good. The surf and turf was really good, as were the crab legs -Sir Olivers (or Krystal, as the menu said) - My fave. The food was really nice - something I'd expect in a upscale restaurant The room was nice, and being on a high floor there was no humidity or mouldy smell at all. Many have commented that the beds are hard, but I didn't mind it at all. I guess I'm weird. The balconies were nice, as were the rooms overall. No complaints at all! As far as the pool, it wasn't crowded in my opinion, and there were always beach chairs open by the pool and on the beach, even later in the day. The swimup bar was great, and they would make drinks as weak or strong as you wanted. There were also lots of activities - we weren't into that, but it's good of you like that. I do prefer adults-only, but there weren't too many children. It would just be nice if they weren't at the swimup bar. We've stayed at other resorts where under 18s can't be right at the bar area, which provides a bit of a spot for those who want to party. I'm sure I'm missing other things, but that's the most of it. The sports bar was fun, although wish you didn't have to pay for the games. Not a big deal though. And finally, we loved speaking Spanish with the staff. They always started in Spanish and stayed with it if you responded alike.

We weren't the only ones, many other people were being told to \"come back in a few hours\". Well we're stuck with all this luggage in an unknown place, easy for you to say.

I thought it would be a great place to take my family...wrong! Let me start off by saying we had a fun time, but would not go there or any other riu resort again. I was traveling with my husband and two toddlers. don't get me wrong, this resort is beautiful, but needs to do differently. not a place for small childdren, maybe couples. the only part of the hotel that is enclosed is the front desk area (lobby) and the 4 restaurants below it. the hallways to the rooms are open air, and VERY stuffy! there is no air flow through them! Front desk we checked in, went to our room, and was told it would be ready in 30 min. mind you, we carried all of our luggage, and children to our 'suppose to be ready' room, we got that fixed and moved to another room, no biggy. Rooms we stayed in 0137, which is on the bottom floor, needed to be updated. they were large and had a well stocked fridge and liquor dispensors. we had ants in our room from day one, and got worse as the week went on. we finally asked for some bug spray and they gave us an almost empty bottle, so it must be pretty normal. they cleaned our rooms once a day. anything wet in the room never completely dried...it stinks after a couple days! we finally put everything out on our balcony! we have washed our clothes 2 times, and the smell is stil in them, it's a musty smell, that is hard to get rid off!! i think this hotel should have been fully enclosed, that would have aleast helped with the ant problem and odor (musty) smell! Service everyone was friendly. we asked for a mattress pad for the hard as rock beds 3 times in one day, before they finally told us they were out. they did bring extra blankets, and thats what we put ontop of the bed to make it bare able to sleep on it. my husband called for more toliet paper, and hadn't received it after an hour, so he just took some off of a cart in the hallway! when you and your child are needing the toliet every 30 minutes, you need your toliet paper! the room service menu sucks! you can only order certain items, Food the food was nothing special, same things everyday. i ended up getting sick (montazuma's revenge) the second day i was there, and still am having the problem. it had to been the food, because we didn't go anywhere else, and i did't drink the water! my kids and husband are having it now that were home. this made for a not so great vacation! Pool we didn't spend anytime at the pool, we have one at home. it seemed to be fun...always music, games, and drinking going on, just not our scene with young children. Beach the beach was great! we had the best time out there! the sand bars are an eyesore, but it does help keeps the waves down to swim and have fun! no one on here has said anything about it's a topless beach! we were surprised when we first got there...now we know most guests there are from europe and other counties, where this is normal. It wasn't bad, just surprising! they did have drink service on the beach, which was nice! the water is beautiful, and the best thing about that place! we booked an excursion through a lady there (erica) with worry free vacations. my husband and i wanted to go parisailing. they were going to let our kids on the boat to watch us, as we went one at a time....sounded great! the night before we were suppose to go is when the diaherra started. i was up all night, along with my son on the toliet! we tried to contact the lady before our scheduled time, but no one knew her number. my husband finally went to talk to her, when she got to the hotel, about getting a refund because i was not going to take my toddler son and me, being sick out on a boat! she told my husband i must have been scared to parisail, and he and my daughter could pay $4 and go with the dolphins instead. my husband was pissed! he was not going to leave us up there in the room, and take my daughter there...we just wanted out $140 back, we never got it! she told him sorry! moral of this story, don't pay cash for excursioins, that way you can dispute it with your credit card company, instead of being out of luck! actully the lady told me the couple before me, missed one of their excusions, and she was talking to them about refunding the money......they paid by credit card! this was with traffic tours by the way! after all of this, we just wanted to go home!

The animation staff worked really hard to entertain the customers and on the whole did a fantastic job, the evenings were fun, but we felt the the loud drinking people around the pool in the late afternoon were encouraged to be even noiser by the entertainment on offer and this seemed to be available to entertain perhaps 50 people who wanted it out of the vast number of guests who probably didnt.

I booked our trip (I am a TA) using the Funjet Fun For Less 5 star, where they pick a resort for you a few days before you leave for a discount. The grounds are lovely and the hotel is pretty in a goddy-peach-walls kind of way, not the modern decor that many of the Riviera Maya resorts go with, but it was kind of a nice change of pace. We arrived around noon and check in was quick and efficient and our room was ready around 2pm. The beach really is lovely by any hotels standards and the giant sand \"whales\" are necessary so that our children can also enjoy these beautiful beaches, and they don't really bother me at all. There were always chairs which I really liked. My biggest problem with this hotel are the rooms. The rooms are really outdated, especially for a newer hotel. The towels both in the room and (especially) at the pool REALLY need to be replaced they were thin and had strings hanging all over them. The beds are very \"firm\" (ie, as hard as rocks) but you can, and should, get a matress pad it helps a little. The bathroom was average, but our camode broke once and the \"whirlpool\" did not work in our tub, no real biggie, as I really didn't come to sit in the bathtub at all. This hotel just isn't 5 star, and that is fine, but Funjet should not sell it as if it were. The food was decent and I did not mind the reservation system really. Going at 8:30pm to the restaurant you want and checking for cancelations worked once for us as well. By the way, the tortilla soup at the Mexican place is fantastic and if you eat Brazillian save room for the last meat, the prime rib, it is by far the best thing I had at the resort. Other than that the food is just Okay and almost never warm. My husband never got one hote meal, everything that came out was luke warm to down right cold, and not just on the buffet, a true 5 star must have better food than this, it just does. The service overall was friendly and fast, nothing spectacular, service should be at least that at a nicer resort. The shows were entertaining and the entertainment staff was one of the highlights of the trip, you could tell they really enjoyed what they were doing. The courtyard is a great place for a drink in the evening and the sports bar isn't half bad. We enjoyed the lobby bar in the evening as well. I really did like this resort, but I did not love it and have other resorts in the area that I would suggest before this one if you are looking for a true 5 star. I am sorry but there are certain things a resort MUST have to be 5 star, and this hotel just isn't it, but htat is okay, as long as you know what to expect. I book honeymoon clients and I don't know that I would send a client here, but it would be great for a family trip and you can't beat the location if you like to be near the city.

We were greeted at the entrance and our bags were placed on a cart for us while we went to check in. We arrived later in the afternoon and the adjoining rooms we requested were not available. However, Augustin was extremely helpful and did the best he could to get us into rooms that were close. Clean rooms, disinfectant smell, but not that bad. Mattress pad not available either, but a very kind maid did come up and placed blankets under the sheets to soften it a bit. My husband called down to room service for some red wine and within 10 minutes a full bottle was sent up along with someone to open it and pour it in the glasses for us. Service never let up during our entire stay. Anything we needed was provided from a staff that was very eager to please. Food was hit and miss, but more enjoyable than not. The Steakhouse food was wonderful, although it was a bit humid that night to be eating outdoors. Sir Olivers was fabulous. Great pumpkin soup and steak was to die for. Brazilian was OK. The line to get reservations was short on the day we did it, however next day people were waiting in a very long line. This is something I agree they should resolve. Beach chairs were plentiful and after taking a walk down the beach, I have to say that this was the best beach in the area by far. It was clean and spacious, unlike the resorts close to it which were small and very crowded. I dragged a chair into the water for my mother and she was in heaven. Snokel gear was available and my daughter was lucky enough to see some nice fish, although there weren't many of them. Playa is right down the road. We walked down once , but took cabs every other time. ($5) Nice place to stroll and shop at night, but every shop shuts down by 10PM. Hotel entertainment is underwhelming.

We absolutely loved this resort. I can't even begin to describe how nice and accommodating the entire staff is. We are definitely laid back people and this was definitely the resort for us. Our favorite restaurant was the steak house; we ate there 2 nights. If you love steak and lobster like us, this is the place for you. The tails are quite small, but we each ordered 2 instead of the 1 that is given and they were fine with giving us extra. If you are unable to make a reservation don't fret, because the buffet is great. We also ate at the Mexican and Japanese restaurants and they were great as well. It is unlikely that you will be able to make a reservation on your first day for the specialty restaurants, because they are usually full. You need to book at least a day in advance. You can make reservations each day from 12-3. We usually got in line about 10 minutes before 12 and never waited longer than 20 minutes to make a reservation. You can book for 2 nights at a time, so be sure to do that to save yourself the trouble of waiting each day. Athough gratuity is included in the package, it is nice to have small bills to tip some people. BE SURE to bring a lot of small bills; they are great to have in order to tip bartenders, drivers if you decide to go on any excursions, maids, etc. We went on 2 excursions. One was the Tulum Extreme which was really fun. We visted Mayan ruins, snorkeled in a cave called a cenote, zip lined through the jungle, rappeled, and were fed lunch. I would recommend finding an excursion where you are able to do many activities in one trip; it saves time and you seem to get more for your money. This excursion was $96 per person including transportation. We left at 7:30am from the lobby and returned by 3pm. A second activity we loved was swimming with the dolphins. It was about 15 minutes away and there are a few different packages you can choose from. We left at 7:30 am and returned by 12:00 pm, so we still had time to hang around the resort. The beach was great. The wait staff is very accommodating especially if you give them a small tip. Our waiter brought us drinks when we didn't even ask and even came into the water to deliver them! The pool is a really fun atmosphere. The swim-up bar is great and there are tables in the pool where you can sit, relax and have a few drinks. There are also activities going on throughout the day including beach volleyball, water volleyball, ping pong, sexy bingo, etc. The night time entertainment wasn't the greatest, but there are shops within a 10 minute walking distance. You can also take a $5 cab ride to 5th avenue to shop (it is only about 5-10 minutes away by cab). The shops are fun, because you can bargain with the vendors and find some really good deals. Overall, our stay was excellent! We didn't want to leave and are definitley thinking of going back. All of the negative reviews I have read on here are minor details.

All our requests for the room (mattress topper, extra towels, etc.) were quickly met. The sand \"whales\" in the water that others have remarked on were no problem - in fact, they lessened the height and intensity of the waves which made it more comfortable in the water. We spent most of our time at the beach area and there was never a problem getting lounge chairs or moving throughout the day to follow the shade. Drink service on the beach was fairly quick. We also did not have a problem making reservations at the specialty restaurants and got to try each one of them. The Brazilian was our least favorite. The buffet restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner had really good selections and new items every day (including sushi one day!). The beach party with barbecued food, drinks in coconut shells, and games was a lot of fun. The bar in the lobby had friendly and efficient staff and was never crowded. The only negative (and not a really big one) was the quality of the nighttime entertainment, always enthusiastic, but not professional quality. The young people on the entertainment staff are working every day from about 10:00 until after the shows around 11 PM, yet are always smiling and full of energy.

We were there for one week, and had selected it based on other reviews on trip advisor. I was concerned because it did not start off too well. I had contacted Riu prior to our trip to ask if they provided transportation from the airport to the resort since it was about an hour south. They told me that they did, and that I should call back 5 days prior to landing so they could arrange to pick us up. Well, I call back and they told me that they only provide transportation if I booked directly with the hotel, but since I booked with orbitz I was on my own. Thanks! Since round trip transportation was 120 dollars by car I was not happy. Since we did not have a lot of money, I looked into any alternatives available. I found some links with folks talking about taking the ADO busline which was 8 dollars per person to playa del carmen. I decided for better or worse we would try it. Turned out to be a great idea. The bus was right there at the airport where all the taxis pick up. It was nice. The bus was a mercades and looked brand new. It had tv's, reclining seats, and cold air conditioning. They load and unload your luggage for you, and all this for 8 bucks a person. We went straight to the bus station in playa del carmen which took about an hour. Once at the station there is a line of taxis waiting to take you to your resort. The taxi ride was only 5 dollars. We finally arived at the resort in the pouring rain, due to tropical storm dolly. We didnt mind because we were so tired. The resort was beutiful and everybody was extremely nice. We asked for a mattress pad at check in because all the reviews I read said the beds were hard. They told us they would send one up. We got to our room which was nice except we got 2 double beds, not great for honeymooners. Within a few minutes housekeeping arrived with several large blankets and sheets. She told us they were out of mattress pads until the next day, but she would put the blankets under the sheets. These beds are like sleeping on concrete without the pads. The blankets helped a litte, but first night we did not sleep too well. However, the next day when we did get the matress everything was ok. The pushed the double beds together and arranged the sheets so that you could not feel the crack between the beds. We were happy. Now back to the resort. The place is truly beutiful. There are plenty of lounge chairs at the pool and the beach, so that nobody if fighting over them. The beach did have large sand bags out in the ocean to prevent beach erosion, but this was true of all the resorts on the beach. Another nice aspect was the fact that there are 5 other riu resorts in the vicinity that you can go to with the same all inclusive benefits outside of dinner. Two of the resorts are land locked and we did not go to them. The other 3 are right next to each other, and only about a 5 to 10 minute walk down the beach. The riu yucatan had wild howler monkeys all over the place, which was pretty cool. Back to the palace. Food was a concern after reading some of the reviews, but we thought it was absolutely great. Breakfast and lunch are buffet style and had something for everybody. For dinner the resort has 5 restaurants and one buffet. The restaurants require a reservation and a dress code of no shorts or tank tops. Getting the reservations were not as hard as I thought they would be after reading the reviews. We were able to eat all of the restaurants within six days, so no problem. They were all really good, with the best being Sir Olivers. The first night we ate the buffet, because we did not have reservations, and honestly I could have eaten it every night, the food was so good. The only thing I can really complain about are the mixed drinks. It was really hard to tell if they had any liqour in them at all. I did read of others complaining about this online, but they said with tips the drinks would be ok. Well from our experience it did not matter if you tipped after every drink, they would still be very very very weak. I would ask them to make it stronger and I would get the same thing. I eventually gave up and drank only corona. You have 24/7 room service available with a limited menu. It always seemed very prompt and easy to do. If you ever needed anything, the front desk always helped. We would just call and they would immediatly send someone up. We asked for a bottle of wine to be sent to the room one night, and it was there within minutes. Another night we asked for a couple more coronas for the minifride, and they brought up six of them right away. Entertainment was ok, all the evening shows were dance themed, which is just not my cup of tea. I thought the vegas show was really good. All in all we had a great time, and thought the resort was excellent. The other guests were not the cancun party type and were more family oriented and couples. There were more kids than I expected, but we dealt with it.

The lobby area is as amazing, I always saw people cleaning, even late at night. Food: Great, we only ate at Sir Oliver once, otherwise just enjoyed the buffet. However, this was not any ordinary buffet, tremendous selection, all items were fresh, and a different theme each night. Pool was wonderful: plenty of chairs, it does get a little crowded during mid-day but still plenty of room to have fun.

The staff takes immaculate care of the grounds. I woke up early a few mornings to use the gym, and the staff is up early ridding the hotel beach area of seaweed, constantly sweeping water away during rains. 24 hour room service was great for my boyfriend and I, especially after a night out at the beautiful beach front clubs in the area. We especially enjoyed the Mexican Toasties (chicken tostadas), and the chocolate cake! 24 hour room service arrived under 15 minutes every time we ordered, no matter what the time. Food: Breakfast is excellent. A large selection of yummy food. Their coffee was great, especially with their freshly made donuts coated in sugar. Lunch: Lunch was not so great for us. It seemed to cater to a different palate, perhaps a more euro flavor. We saved banana's from breakfast to munch on for lunch. Dinner: We only visited the steakhouse, which was alright. A couple who had visited Riu 3 other times told us to just eat at the buffet and we followed their advice. We preferred the buffet only because you can get lots of what you like. PLUS they had an amazingly tasty CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN every night with every fruit, marshmellow (they had STRAWBERRY marshmellows!! yum!). They also fried up plaintains in batter that were just about the most delicious treat I ever had. Entertainment: My boyfriend and I are in our mid-late 20's, so we felt the bands were a great addition to the dinner atmosphere. I especially enjoyed the band that played Santana tunes. We would watch the bands for a bit after dinner before we headed out to the clubs (which are AWESOME). The music during the day by the pool and beach were very fun, I heard them play one of my favorite Selena songs! I recommend younger visiters leave the hotel and go out to Coco Maya and Blue Parrot (recommended by bartenders in the sports bar). The blue parrot has the famous fire show at 11:30. Lady's night are tuesdays and thursdays at blue parrot. The hotel dies down at night but if u wanna have fun without going out, go to the sports bar. The Bartertenders were so kind, made great drinks. When it rains, go see a movie. Playa has very very nice movie theaters, and the movies are in English! (with spanish subtitles or sometimes dubbed over). Booze: Ok, I keep reading reviews saying the drinks were watered down. You must not be ordering the right drinks! Although I'm not a drinker, my boyfriend had NO problem getting shots of Don Julio- his favorite tequila. If you want it stronger, ask for a double or on the rocks, because they are more than happy to get you drunk - ask my boyfriend! :) Speak up and tell the sweet bartenders you want it strong. You have no one to blame but yourself on that one. sorry. Rooms: Rooms were beautiful. My only advice for light sleepers like myself, ask to be far away from the lobby where the nighttime entertainment is. Also, we unfortunately got placed directly above the sports bar (room 2083). The sports bar is open 24 hours, so we eventually asked to move because of the loud bass from the music, to a room closer to the beach which was perfect. Staff: the staff at the front desk very sweet and cool. They suggested the two awesome clubs we went to. The bartender at the sports bar also recommended the same two clubs. Very helpful. Additionally, they were very accommodating with us wanting to move rooms and with any question we had. My boyfriend speaks spanish, so that helped to build good vibes any time we engaged with the staff. We tipped the staff normally in dollars.

This was our first time ever at a RIU and we Stayed 7-16 to 7-21. My husband and I travel twice a year and stay at only higher rated hotels. We both currently work in the hospitality industry and I feel are very fair in our reviews. I had did much research reading all the good and bad reviews so, I want this review to help you so here are my honest thoughts. Hotel Property and Apperance; Stunning! - Beautiful grounds imaculately kept. The location was perfect right next to town the best! Spa ; We did a detox body wrap - This was SO worth the money - make sure you get the RIU class card and they give you 15% off. Pedicure was just ok. Pool Area; Very Large well kept - There is not a kids pool area so if this is not your thing it can be a bit overwhelming at times. Rooms; We stayed in 3089 and glad we were up. If you go request a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor. The rooms on the 1st floor all are outside and I am sure this is where the musty rooms are. When you go up there are no outside corridors so that said - no musty smell or humid rooms. The room was okay - The beds are very hard ask for the matress pad! Our bed spread was very dirty with stains - gross! Our toilet was no good - to get it to flush you had to flush it three times. House keeping; HORRIBLE! The room was never really cleaned they just made the bed - They never once washed down the shower at all! The shampoo dispenser stayed broken on the ledge the whole time we were there and funny the couple that we went with said the smae thing?? The last day we were there they never clesned the room at all (nor our friends room) when we found a house keeper and asked him he rolled his eyes and was like ok!- We NEVER once got a towel animal and we all know how much we look forward to those in mexico. Restaurants; SIR OLIVER is Amazing!!!! - My husband is a Chef for Marriott and he LOVED- We went there twice and it was excellent both nights! Go there as many times as you can. The steak house; was good to they give you this chilled seafood appetizer and it was VERY GOOD! Two of us ordered our steaks very rare and when delvered they were well done but, the manager quickly saw our dismay and changed out our steaks for rare ones - we also told him the lobsters were too small (cause they are) but he brought us extras on plates - It all was very nice in the end. Mexican restaurant; The appetizer buffet was good it is the only \"mexican style\" food you will get since their menu is not?? Well that is if you call jalapeno poppers mexican food! - LOL I am not kidding you. They did have some tasty sopes and calamari were both good. I had the Fruit and nut stuffed pork it was over cooked - my husband had the fish which we were quite sure was a frozen fish and not fresh our friends had the beef and shrimp - The shrimp were super small! - Over all not very good we were starving by 11pm and had to heat up the nasty food from the sports bar. Buffet - Good breakfast - Lunch so so it's a buffet -so what right! My bigest problem with the restaurants is they only have 12 tables in each restaurant with two seatings so you do the math this means they only have 120 reservations per night for a resort that at a minimum has 850 people in it. It's truly messed up the way they do this and the restaurants are WAY TOO SMALL! We were lucky b/c we had two rooms we could make all of the reservations at once but the first night we had to eat in the buffet b/c they had no more reservations. We never got to the Japanese or Brazilian Service- EXCELLENT!!! Bartenders/ Servers - Claudia and Islas were the best! Rosario at Sir Oliver awsome! Beltran and Santos - servers amazing! Charley at the Pool seriously he ran with our drinks - They all rocked!! I keep seeing people complain about watered down drinks - and yes if you order the Foo Foo drinks they are watered down but all you need to do is ask for a double and they give you plenty of booze! This is how most A-I do it! Warning!!!- The Bar by the entertainment had cock roaches all over it. This happened the last night we were there - It was weird b/c we sat there every night previous and never saw one the last night there were seriously at least 50 that we saw when they started crawling on our sideof the bar we left and went to the lobby bar. GROSS!!!! The entertainment got better the more you drank I guess that is all I can say. I Hope you find this helpful! I do want to stress we had a wonderful vacation and none of these problems stopped us from having a good time.

This was our 5th trip to the Cancun/Riviera Maya area. We booked through Apple Vacations, as we always do. I can not say enough great things about Apple Vacations - definitely the best way to travel! However, I strongly disagree with their 6 golden Apple rating for the RPRM. Based on the service, food, drinks and pool area, the hotel is at best a 5 red Apple. Food: The streakhouse had good food and a nice atmosphere. The Brazilian restaurant was just okay and the Japenese restaurant was not very good. The buffets offered a ton of selections for breakfast, lunch and dinner. However, the food was just not enjoyable. Though we were never starving, we did not really enjoy any of the food during the course of our stay. Service: I have read reviews raving about the service, I must say I can't Disagree enough. As far as we were concerned, the staff was very unattentive, unfriendly and less than impressive. If they only spent as much time serving guests as they did cleaning up, they would be in much better shape. The service at the pool bar and buffets were by far the worst! The service in the specialty restaurants and in the lobby bars was ok. Drinks: Oh, where to begin..........The drinks were so incredibly watered down and it was near next to impossible to even catch a buzz after drinking ALL day (and from past experiences this is NOT typical of all inclusive restaurants). The beer was surprisingly good (Corona) but the mixed drinks and frozen drinks were nearing on horrific. Property: This was the saving grace of our trip. The hotel property is amazing and it is truly breathtaking. We had a superior junior suite on the first floor right near the pool facing the courtyard. The room was simple yet nice and our view was well worth the money for the upgrade. Only complaint about the room was the smell. We didn't pay much attention to it while we were there, but now that we are home, our clothing and suitcases have retained the smell. I am afraid I am going to have to trash some of our belongings as I can't seem to get the smell out of certain things (despite being washed numerous times). Pool: The pool area was nice (though it got very crowded throughout the day - for a hotel this size, there should have been more pools). There are tons of palm trees surrounding the pool area which makes it impossible to get any seats that are in the sun all day. But after hours in the sun at times the shade was a welcoming break. The infininity pool was relaxing and offered a great view of the pool and the beach/ocean. Only warning about the pool, there is no children's pool area which means all the kids are in the main pool, infinity pool and in the swim-up bar area. After a few days, this definitely became annoying. Entertainment: First of all, let me say that the entertainment staff appeared to work very hard morning, noon and night and I must commend them for that. However, they are definitely not professionals and that really reflected in their daily activities and nightly performances. Definitely by far the worst All Inclusive entertainment I have ever experienced. Spa: My husband I endulged in a couples massage one evening. Overall our experience at the spa was very pleasant. The staff in the spa was very attentive and very pleasant. The massages were great and I would definitely recommend utilizing the spa. Overall, my husband and I had an enjoyable trip and did not walk around complaining all week (I promise we didn't). Just looking back at it now, I would have without a doubt booked a different property. With that being said, if you are considering a RIU property, I would think twice about it. After this experience, I will never again consider another RIU property. From past All Inclusive experiences, I highly recommend Iberostar or Palace chains..............They by far are in a different league than the RIU's (despite their similar ratings)!", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KENTUCKY", "Title": "\u201cCANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK NEXT YEAR!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "BEC258", "ReviewID": "UR17751911", "Content": "I have to say that this resort is Fabulous!!!!!

I spent a lot of time reading reviews and comments in the forum and felt I should give a little back. This was our third trip to Playa Del Carmen. We stayed at the RPM the first two times and decided to stay at the RPRM this time, so you will probably see a lot of comparisons between the two in this review. Hotel in general The hotel was very nice. Always clean and everyone was incredibly friendly. The hotel was very similar to the RPM, but was a little less worn. The grounds were perfect. Room Very similar to RPM. Had a King sized bed which was nice. Asked for the mattress pad which made the hard bed very comfortable. Pool We are not pool people, and I think I spent a total of 10 minutes in the RPM pool in 2005 and 2006. However, I really enjoyed the RPRM pool. We would sit in the elevated section (infinity pool) in the afternoon for an hour or so before we went up and started getting ready for dinner. The pool seemed pretty clean, but I did notice a little scummy build up in the lower pool one afternoon when the pool was very crowded. There were always a lot of people in the pool, but you could get chairs if you wanted them. Beach The beach was as expected. The giant sand bag whales really took something away, but you could tell that the beach was getting better. The water was not as clear and there was a little more seaweed type vegetation than before. I think this was due to the whales. We did enjoy the beach and spent most of our time there, but it's hard not to compare it to the glory days of 2005. The beach was closer to the hotel than at the RPM which was nice. Bars I did quite a bit of drinking, so I consider myself a bar expert. I loved the lobby bar. It was so much nicer than the RPM lobby bar. No thick cigar smells and plenty of room. The sports bar was nice. Played a couple of games of pool one afternoon for $3 each. Pool/beach bar was good. Food I think the food was my favorite part. So I may put too much detail in this section. Breakfast - Had the buffet every morning. Omelets, pancakes and sausage were my favorite. Had to have a Mimosa every morning with breakfast. Lunch - We had lunch everyday at Chilis. I was a little surprised that the Buffet was not open for lunch. I'm pretty sure it was at the RPM. Chilis was good, but did get a little repetitive. They always had one or 2 new things, but a lot of the same stuff. My favorites were the mussels. They only had them 2 days out of 5. Dinner - We only ate at the buffet on the first night and made dinner reservations for the next 4. However, I made it a point to stop by the buffet and see what they had every night. Night 1 - Buffet. It was Mexican night which may have been the best buffet we saw. Tostados were great and they were making Chiros (sp?), fried cinamon bread sticks. They were both great. Also had a pig. It tasted good, but I tried not to look it in the eye when they were carving. Overall, the buffet was above average, but it was not as big as the RPM and the variety from night to night was limited. I would recommend going to the specialty restaurants as much as possible, and if you get something you don't like then go to the buffet. Night 2- Mexican. This was the only restaurant available for the evening, so we booked it and didn't expect much. However, we were very pleasantly surprised. The appetizer buffet was great. My wife loved the burritos and the shrimp was pretty good. Night 3 - Japanese. Always a favorite for us. Everything was great. The shrimp was the best dinner and the fried ice cream was the best dessert. Night 4 - Sir Oliver/Krystal. The sign over the restaurant says Sir Oliver. The menu says Krystal. This place was a little too fancy for us, but we enjoyed it. Thebest appetizers were the shrimp and vegetable ravioli and pumpkin soup with scallops. Stay away from the cruncy vegetable thing. Not so good. The steak was very good, but my wife did not like the lamb. She normally loves lamb, but thought the flavor was too strong. Chocolate dessert was amazing. Night 5 - Steak house. Not very excited about this because we hated the steakhouse at the RPM, but we were very pleasantly surprised. We had an awesome table overlooking the beach. The seafood appetizer was good. The filet and lobster was very good. I loved the baked alaska dessert.", "Date": "July 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cCan't say enough good things!!!!\u201d", "Author": "kdkeating", "ReviewID": "UR17736816", "Content": "Sorry It took so Long!!

We picked the middle wedding option because it fit our needs. Including us, there was only 13 in the wedding party, so we wanted a simple laid back (stress free) wedding. Our room was upgraded to a big wonderful suite and was very quite and odor free! It was located in the middle of the hotel and we thought we wouldn't like being on the first floor, but we loved it! When we arrived on the afternoon of the 27, we made reservations for 11 the next night at the mexican restaurant (good) and for 13 the following night for the brazilian steak house (awesome). Both reservations at 6:30. No problem making reservations. Buffet had a huge selection and most of it was pretty good. The day after we arrived we met w/ the wedding coordinator and finalized the details....everything went very smooth and we added a few extras. One extra we loved was live music by the trio! We were just going to use the recorded music but the trio played at our table the first night at the hotel and really enjoy the music! Wedding went smoothly but was very hot at 4pm on July 1. We hired the photographer for extra photos and he was wonderful, Carlos. We stayed at a different hotel for the honeymoon (The Royal) and Carlos brought the photos to us! We had the reception dinner at Chilis and we were given our own personal dinning area, everyone seemed to really enjoy their meals! Overall, this was a perfect hotel for our wedding and all our guests seemed to really enjoy themselves. In fact, some are already talking about going back next year! Staff was friendly, food good, and great drinks! ***If you want to go out for an awesome dinner, try Hotel Fusion! You sit at small tables on the beach and enjoy good food and cold beer! So good, we went back to back nights! The only bad part of the vacation was that one of our guests stepped on some type of critter in the ocean and his foot was swollen for about 24 hours.

Don't expect 5 star food but there was plenty of variety so you could always find something you did like. Not to repeat old reviews, but here were the highlights that were useful to us: - Request a room not on the ground floor, it'll be much more quiet, also ask for one not facing the main courtyard if you want to sleep before 11PM otherwise you'll hear the entertainment. Ask for the mattress topper for your bed, expect you'll have to ask 2x to get someone to actually come put it on. - Take along scented candles in case your room has a mildewy smell, ours didn't but several people we spoke to did just from all the humidity there. - You can only make restaurant reservations between noon-3PM in the main lobby, if you go a little after noon there's no line. There's 2 sittings for each restaurant, one around 6:30 and another around 8:45. One alternative we found was that you can ask the maitre d around 6:30 if they have any unfilled reservations for the late sitting, they probably won't but will tell you to check back around 9PM and if there's no show's you can be seated, this worked 2 out of 3 times for us so we only ate at the buffet 2x and all other nights at a restaurant. Oliver's is probably the nicest one. The Japanese was ok, Mexican was good but don't expect Taco Bell type choices it's not Tex-Mex like most americans are used to, Chilis steak house was ok although again not a 5 star steakhouse, I'd compare it to Texas Roadhouse restaurant quality. We didn't do the brazilian place. - The night entertainment was nothing to write home about but was sufficient to serve as background music/commotion while out drinking in the outdoor lobby bar area - Speaking with other guests who were coming from other Riu properties the consensus definitely was the Riviera Palace Maya property is the best Riu one with second place being the Riu Palace Mexico. You're allowed to go to the other Riu properties although you can't eat dinner there - The beach was fine, we never had problems finding chairs out there (although if you want pool side ones you might have to get there before 10). The sandbags are just like big rocks, they are not appealing to the eye but they're along the whole coast from the hurricane so you can't really blame the hotel, there's plenty of room to swim regardless.

Cocktails: This is the one reason and pretty much only reason I will never visit this resort again. You can't get a buzz. The small little plastic cups can be sucked down in two seconds, I don't want to have to order a cocktail every 5 minutes, very little alcohol in them, cheap alcohol unless you demanded. I honestly drank all day and never got a buzz, I got full of drinks but never a buzz. Good Luck. The best cocktail I had was when I was leaving to go back home from a a rest. in the airport. I would have order less drinks, gotten a buzz and they wouldn't have had to wash 50 glasses a day and make me 50 cocktails a day. I've been coming down to Mexico for 20 years, and normally mexican resorts make great cocktails. I was almost tempted to get back behind the bar like the old days and just make it myself. Pool: Great Layout, Plenty of Chairs and Room in the pool. Beach: Was Great, lot of things to do. Breakfast: Great Buffet, Lunch at Chilis plenty of offering for everyone, including children, vegetarians, etc. If they could fix the reservation situation and make a better drink they could charge me $100.00 a day more and I would gladly pay. If you are going to enjoy a good cocktail. WARNING!!!! Rooms: Room was good after I payed for it. Stay away from the area where they have the nightly entertainment, or you won't sleep early if you chose too. Very Clean, Well Stocked with the dependable Corona Extra. The bed was like sleeping a concrete. Glad they had a spa, after two days of that I needed. No wonder why the spa busy with sore backs. Sports Bar: A couple of Pool Tables. Now why charge $3.00 for a game of Pool, when you are including everything else. This makes no sense. Is that what keeps them profitable????? Just let me play as much pool as I would like and tack on a few dollars to the daily rate. Duh!!! Charge me the $6.00 for a Pina Colada or $6.00 for a Mai Tai and I bet you make a good one. You are trapped. I am ready for a good cocktail when I go home tonight. Just 1 1/2 ounces of a regular quality alcohol with a decent mix and I will be in heaven.

But the main impression is that we will never stay at this place again. Outdoor areas were beautiful, well maintained and clean. We felt safe wherever we went, including evening walks to town. That was wonderful. The entertainment crew were lovely, lively and did their best to keep people happy and entertained. Indoor areas were pretty, but the heavy use of strong smelling cleaning products /artificial perfume was quite in a league of its own... ROOMS Indoor areas did not impress me as much. Our room smelled extremely damp the night we arrived, but we were so tired and jetlagged that we thought it was us. But it soon dawned on us that it was the room. 2 days later I asked to change rooms because of the smell, but got the answer that the hotel was full... The bathroom had black mould in the ceiling, and in the corners of the showerrom. The painting was also peeling (perhaps in an effort to scrub the mould off???). There was no fan/ventilation in this room. First day we had to contact maintenance, as the bathtap fell off. Gradually the smell began to take to our clothes. We could not keep anything in the drawers. Nothing ever dried up, the entire room was damp, no matter how low the AC was turned on. In our last week they painted the walls in the hallway outside our room, and we had to zigzag between (abandoned) ladders and wet paint to get out. Still no chance of changing a room, and getting one off the ground floor (other guests told us that the moist feeling was less higher up). Three weeks after our return, and 5 washings later, I have thrown away several pieces of clothing and a bag, as the smell of mould will not come out. It \"clung\" to everything, shoes, bags, and linen... :( Tv-signals fell out regulary. When asked for anything sugarfree beverages for the minibar, they could only give us water. FOOD For someone with lactose intolerance it was difficult to manouver around food, as the waiters/chefs all assured me that there was no milk in so and so products, only for me to end up sick in the bathroom afterwards due to being misinformed. We both got food poisoning from a \"fiesta\" at the beach where they handed out coconuts. I had three sips, was sick 3 days, partner 5 days... We were not alone, the next week they cancelled the fiesta... Almost all of the restaurants had buffet-style service (sic). Plus for the japanese and the gourmet place, which both had a la carte. The lunchbuffet was riddled with birds, that landed on your table, and (loudly) tried to take their pick, meaning literally that if you sat and turned your back, they would land on your plate. The staff at \"Chili's\"made little or no effort to chase them away, whereas in the morning the staff at the main breakfast area managed to chase them off. All in all, not what we expected from such a place, and many, many steps below similar (and much cheaper) places in Croatia, France and USA.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ohio", "Title": "\u201cAwsome, RELAXING trip\u201d", "Author": "ramph", "ReviewID": "UR17156477", "Content": "Great time.

We've been to the Barcelo Bavaro, IB Tucan, Lindo, & Maya, Blue Bay, rented a villa in Jamaica, and 4 diff. places in the DR. This Riu ranks right in the upper middle of this group. Entrance and lobby are simply lovely - chandeliers, coffered ceilings, plants, lighting. Slight mess up with our reservation (Funjet had only sent paperwork for 1 room) was quickly corrected after we showed our papers. Email sent in advance with room request (we got a riu class card in advance) didn't seem to make a difference. We told them it was our 20th anniv., and strangely enough, a few days into the vacation, we got a fruit plate with \"happy honeymoon\" on it. Explained with our simple spanish, and they told us to keep it anyway. Hope we didn't get some poor couple's fruit plate. Everything here tells you to try to get a courtyard view. We didn't, but found our outer facing rooms fine (2134, 2135). View of the Reef resort next door was pleasant in the morning, and it was quiet. Courtyard view might have been nice, unless you overlooked the evening entertainment, in which case it might have been noisy at night. As others stated, you do hear doors slamming, people walking down the halls - kind of echos. Not a big thing. Room was clean, heavy, dark furnature; coffered ceilings, even in the shower. Shower had jac. tub which we didn't use (the girls did and loved it). Plenty of hot water, and none of the cold surges I've noticed elsewhere. Beach: Sand whales as stated, didn't bother us much as we know there wouldn't be much beach without them. We went in most days, floated on tubes or just hung out riding small waves. Sand bags look kind of like huge rocks, and we thought our beach was much better than those around us. Lots of chairs in sun or shade, no need to reserve, and small beach bar set up daily. Drink service was frequent and prompt. Drinks were your average AI, but hit the spot. Pool: Very warm in June. We felt that the Riu pool was too small for the resort, because the water would be dirty (sunscreen slime floating on the surface, some straws, etc.) by the end of the day. Lots of people hanging out by the pool bar, fun, nice crowd most of the time. Watch out for sexy bingo and the winner's pole dance if you're not into that. Again, frequent and prompt pool drink service. A little harder to find chairs around the pool, but there were always 2-3 together for us at any given time. Get your towel cards at the desk at check-in (we had to go back for them) - easy to trade for as many towels as you need. Most days they seemed to want to give us more towels than we needed cards for, which ended us up with 6 cards. Food: They really need building concierges for dinner reservations. Line up at noon took at least 1/2 hr to get to the reservation person. Shorter line after 1:00. You can book 2 reservations at a time, but only for 4 days out. Usually they're full 1-2 days out. We were able to try all of them (6:30 or 8:45 sittings with 6:30 filling up faster). Japanese has no show tables - hubby enjoyed sushi. Mexican, like most places we've visited, had a better appetizer selection than the menu - you could have just eaten there. Gourmet had limited selection (girls didn't find anything they liked and ate at the buffet). Hubby and I enjoyed it (vegetable puff pastry appetizer was great). Steakhouse is the only outdoor restaurant (hot in June). Seafood and salad appetizer for everyone, small selection of entrees, but surf and turf was good (daughter was able to get extras of the surf portion, which made her happy). Baked alaska at the end for everyone, which was tasty. We enjoyed the Brazilian the most with the never-ending skewers of meat. Tried to go there again, but it was full. We ate 3 times at the evening buffet (spent one night away from the resort in Valladolid). Best night seemed to be customer comment night where the staff leaped over each other to serve you. Otherwise your average AI buffet with a good variety of choices and plenty to fill you up. Breakfast buffet had omelet station, fried, boiled and scrambled eggs, lots of breads and pastries, fruit (mango one day - where did it go after that?), salad stuff, bacon, sausage, etc. Plenty to fill you up for the entire day. Lunch buffet at Chillis actually seemed to offer better variety than the main one. No one got sick, and we all must have gained from all the food and drinks. Overall, we had a great time.

Hotel - beautiful, extremely clean, stylish, 5/5 stars! Room - We opted for the upsized suite and it was definitely larger. Walk-in closet, living room, HUGE bathroom w/jet tub, balcony and King sized bed. Pool - Large enough and plenty of chairs. Yes, a few loud/drunk people at times but it's vacation-get over it. Plenty of young couples meeting each other, pool volleyball, swim up bar, etc. It's not Cancun so it wasn't too crazy. Lots of families too. Beach - Awesome beach set-up, plenty of chairs you can move as you want. Wait staff on the beach too! Water was basically enclosed by some rocks so it's good to just dip in and cool off. No real waves but it's not Hawaii. Activities - Hotel constantly kept people busy with plenty of pool,beach,lawn activities- daily winners would even get prizes at night. Food-Yes, you need to make reservations during the day and they fill up fast but if you're staying for 4-6 days, I suggest just making res. for a couple of nights and hitting the buffet the other nights. Buffet breakfast was pretty good and we ARE \"foodies\" and enjoy good food. Plenty of choices, (there was bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc every day by the way). Lunch was perfect selection to fill you up from a hot day of sunbathing. Staff was extremely pleasant, attentive and fast at all times. Bottomline, great place for young couples/families with older kids. Not recommended for singles. If you want 5-star food, go to Italy. If you want pretty good buffet food that's available practically 24hrs., this is perfect. All staff was fully bilingual but if you at least try to speak a little Spanish and are friendly, you'll benefit much more.

Overall I would say that this is a nice place to stay. Let me start with our arrival. We arrived around 9:00 pm with our children, ages 14 and 6. Check-in was slow because there was only one person at the front desk. However, they were friendly and answered all of our questions. We booked a room with a court yard view. I am glad we did. Our room was on the third floor overlooking the courtyard and pool area. The room looked a little dated and was in need of a face lift. However, it was very clean and didn't have a musty smell. Our room had two full size beds that were pushed to gather. When I saw this I got worried because our 14 year old is bigger than me, and my husband is over 6ft. When our bags arrived the bellman offered to bring a rollaway for our son. This worked great, they set up the rollaway in the small living area and everyone had plenty of room. The resort is very pretty and well landscaped. The staff is friendly and helpful. There were plenty of chairs at the pool and on the beach. We would usually arrive at the pool around 10:00am and had no problem finding four chairs to gather. The beach was nice and we didn't have any problem with seaweed on the beach during our stay. There are large sandbags in the water to help with beach erosion. Some people have said that they found them to be unsightly, but to me they look like large rocks with moss on them. Our children enjoyed climbing on them and jumping into the ocean. The food was average. Breakfast is really good, they have a large selection. We ate lunch at Chili's and it was good but they had the same thing everyday. The way they have the reservation system set-up needs to be changed. Some reviewers have said they had to wait in line for over an hour to make reservations. I didn't however, you got to stop what your doing in the middle of the day and go make reservations. Because of this we only ate at two of the specialty resturants. The mexican and the steak house. Both were average. The kids liked the buffet the best because they could get burgers and pizza.

I agree with much of what a few of the others who were there that week wrote. So, without repeating everything, here's a few things off the top of my head: 1) The hotel: really is very beautiful. The rooms were gorgeous. But, note-the walls are not very soundproof. Also, DO NOT let them put you in the ground level rooms, around 013 because the entertainment bar is RIGHT across the hall and every night they perform and are very loud. The performers leave the back stage-door open and talk very loudly. I can't tell you how many times I had to get out of bed late at night and keep asking them to shut the door and not talk in the hall--which reminds me, the hall echoes quite a bit, so when people walk by it can get very noisy. I guess the noise would be my biggest complaint about the rooms. The other complaint--the musty, moldy smell. We tried to air it out, but to no avail. Also--the air conditioner stopped working in the middle of the night twice. Last--our balcony overlooked a courtyard and the resort next door. It could get loud at times and when the workers were out there they would whistle and yell profanities at us when we left the door open or smoked on the balcony! 2) The food: YUCK. Read other posts for details--it's all true. Bland, undercooked, boring. VERY disappointing and for us a dealbreaker. It looked pretty, but absolutely nothing tasted great. Even the fruit was bland. And it's true--the drinks are very weak and very sugary. Again, nothing exciting. Service was pretty good. I noticed that many of the buffet servers worked all three shifts--that's about 15 hours. I tried not to let it bother me, but it did. Day after day they worked those long hours and always smiled and treated us well, so I really appreciated it--I would be very cranky! 3) The beach: It was rougher than I expected. Too murky to snorkel. At times too many people. And way too many water sports going on--it always smelled of gasoline and exhaust and it was loud. Oh, and Americans--there are topless sunbathers, so beware! 4) The pool: I agree with the post about the loud drunks--they overtook the swim-up bar area and made it generally unpleasant to hang out in the pool. Also, another huge disappointment was that the pool bar shuts down at 6pm and then no swimming after 8pm--that is so early to shut down! I would have loved taking an after-dinner swim. 5) Playa del carmen shopping: Too busy, too touristy, and way more expensive than expected. We also got heckled and were called some pretty nasty names when we wouldn't go into some stores. NOTE: Alcohol is CHEAPER at the AIRPORT--so wait until you go to the duty-free shop there to buy. Also, walking to town really does take a good 15 mins at a moderate pace. It's a safe and interesting walk, but when it's hot out you should probably just take a taxi. Oh yes--I noticed that taxis would charge more when they found out we were staying at the RIU Palace. So, you should go to the street and catch one on your own if you want to save a few dollars. 6) GO TO COZUMEL! That was the highlight of my trip. Everything was cheaper there, snorkeling was a dream, and they have many free beaches where you can eat and drink and snorkel (or swim). Taxis are cheap and convenient from the pier. It was only half an hour on the ferry. Oh, and DON'T buy round trip tickets because there are two companies which operate the ferries; thus, they only operate every other hour--so, you might get stuck waiting two hours to get back.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT GET MARRIED HERE\u201d", "Author": "mzf0307", "ReviewID": "UR17026835", "Content": "This hotel was incredibly disappointing in many ways. I have never written a bad review before, but I feel like I should warn people. First the website is very deceiving.... there is only 1 pool, the hot tub is in the spa and covered. The restaurants you need reservations for and you can only make reservations from Noon until 3, if you are only there for a couple of days you'll be eating at the buffet the whole time as all of the reservation restaurants fill up 2 days in advance, sometimes 3. Very misleading. I actually got married there... which was the poorest service I've ever had in my life. They have a very bad spa, I paid $80 for pedicure with no massage or soaking whatsoever, it took 10 minutes. I opted to get my hair done there, but they didn't have room for my bridesmaids because another wedding booked up the spa all, which was good for my bridesmaids in the end. They sat me in a chair with no mirror as I explained to my non-english speaking hairdresser what I wanted (which was a down, natural looking do), she used aqua net on one strand and sizzled it with a curling iron. That's all I have to say, worst hair do ever! Then the other bride in that room was supposed to get married that previous Friday on the beach, but postponed it to Monday due to weather and her wedding time was scheduled at 4:00. This should not have been a problem as my wedding was a different location at 5. It turned out she got married at my spot, at my time, my 45 guests were arriving at a different wedding, very confused. Pretty bad there, no apologies from the staff whatsoever. I got over it. so we moved on to the reception where we paid $400 for a private area for dinner and $1000 for a DJ for 3 hours, which was a rip off to begin with. Dinner started 1/2 an hour late, they turned the lights up 1/2 an hour early in the middle of a song, with no notice and staff waited with their arms crossed for us leave. Ridiculous.

The only complaint was it rained every day but the last. My family and I have been going to the Carribean every summer for 19 years, we only stay all inclusive. With this said, this hotel by far had the friendliest and most hospitable staff we have ever encountered. They work their tails off day in and day out but will stop at anything to help or serve the guests. The hotel itself is also gorgeous!!! There is a few problems we encountered. My mother has a hard time climbing stairs and there were only 2 elevators located at this huge hotel and they were close to the lobby. We had to do a lot of walking to go back and forth to the elevator. I would recommend that if someone you're traveling with suffers from the same, that you ask for a room close to the elevators. By the way, the elevator stopped working the last 2 days so my mother was forced to climb the stairs. The beach was beautiful but because of the rain there was a lot of seaweed. I read other reviews that complained about the huge sand bags on the beach. Yes, it is an eye sore but seemed to be a lot of fun for the beach goers. Every day people were having a blast trying to get on top of those and diving off. The entertainment was good, it is what you expect at an all inclusive. Nothing outstanding but nothing poor. The food. The first couple of nights we were forced to eat at the main restaurant, which we were not impressed with. But the last couple of nights we ate at the Brazilian and Steak House and loved it. I would recommend that the day you check in you go and stand in the 30 min. line for reservations. They only let you do 2 at a time and when we did the first couple of nights were already booked. So out of 6 days that we stayed, we only got to eat at the specialty restaurants 2 times.

CONS: They water down their liquor. The first two days we were there, I found myself drinking shot after shot of tequila and never feeling the slightest bit tipsy. The drinks menu says they have El Jimador, Absolut and Kahlua, but when you order these it's definitely not what you get. It's frustrating not to be able to get drunk on vacation! We finally walked down the street to the shops and bought our own, non-watery tequila. They also only serve Corona and Negra Modelo for beers. The Negra Modelo tastes very watery, and not at all like the bottled Negra Modelo we drank outside the resort. Waiting in line to make dinner reservations is a huge waste of time. You can only make two days of reservations at a time, the only time to make reservations is from 12-3 (prime pool/beach time), and it takes over an hour to make it to the front of the line. They only have one staff person taking reservations for the entire property. When I did get to the front of the line (after over an hour), they only reservation they had for the following evening was at a restaurant we'd already tried. No food after midnight. They say that room service is available 24/7, but when we called after midnight no one answered. If you get hungry for a midnight snack, the only option is a fridge full of hamburgers and hot dogs in the Sport Bar. PROS: Plenty of seating. There was always plenty of room on the beach, and it was easy to find a table at the buffets for breakfast and lunch. We also never had a problem finding a seat in the bars or on the patios throughout the property. Quick staff responses. When we called for more towels and for someone to look at our broken shower, they were there promptly and we got several follow-up phone calls to make sure we were satisfied. Room service also arrived pretty quickly, in about 15-20 minutes. Beautiful beach. The water was clear and the sand was white and beautiful. We went swimming every day, and it was wonderful! Beautiful surroundings. There was a wide Spanish-style square in the middle of the resort that was so nice to sit out on and watch people, while enjoying a watery cocktail. The La Habana bar in the lobby was also very nice, with attentive waiter service and piano music before dinner. Free wi/fi in the lobby. The hotel also provides several computers with internet access that can be used at $8 per hour, but wi/fi was handy if you don't mind toting a laptop. NEUTRAL: Food. The reservation-only dinner restaurants were fine, and the same can be said of the lunch and dinner buffets. Neither provide reasons to to stay away from, or choose, this hotel. Entertainment. There were several variety shows (Grease, Vegas, and a comedy medley) and a casino night, but having drinks in the piano bar or on the patio won out every night for us.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis, Mo", "Title": "\u201cPlan ahead to make it perfect!!!!\u201d", "Author": "FuninPlaya", "ReviewID": "UR16830606", "Content": "Thanks to TripAdvisor, we were well prepared for the specific nuances of this hotel as they all have them! This is what you should know: Before you go: Bring some 2 dollar bills. They love them and believe they are good luck. Bring your own beach towels. Book your tone way ransportation to hotel. See below... Transportation: (Airport to Hotel Transfers) Don't book \"shared\" transfers from airport to hotel through your travel agent. There are much less expensive and very efficient options available on the web. Try USA Transfers to the hotel but do not book a round trip. Simply get a cab for the return trip 45-50 usd. Collectively we (2pp) paid 100 usd and saved so much time and money. So many persons stated they opted with the agency transfer package deal (50-100 usd pp) and it took them forever to get to the hotel due to the multiple stops at other hotels. Our driver stopped by our request at a gas station to pick up a 6 pack and was at the hotel in 30-35 minutes. The return trip is cheaper due to the airport restriction on who can do business from the airport. (Renting a Car/Jeep using Taxi) Safe, good roads and reputable national chains at your disposal. Parking is free at the RIU. We elected not to rent the jeep we had intended to use throughout our stay when we realized taxi services is 5 usd into town. If ya just want to get lost in Mexico rent a jeep but there really is no need unless you go to Cozumel to explore the island... of which I strongly reccomend!!!! Checking In: 1) Check in on a Mon-Thur. Room options are much better. 2) Ask for a room immediately above the lobby facing the beach!!!! The rooms/patio are smaller however this puts you in the bottom of the hotel's horseshoe . You can't beat the view, quiet, and the ability to peoplewatch in the center court and it's convenient to everything! 3) Insist upon a mattress topper install within the hour. Don't let them fool you into, \"we'll send someone up\". We had to ask twice. Tip the the person who put it on the bed because it is quite the chore. Don't pass on the mattress topper or you won't be happy with the beds! 4) Make reservations at the restaraunts. If you dont, no big deal, the buffet is great! Where to go: (Playa) Definately have to go to dowtown and do some shopping. SHOP AROUND! Please don't see an item for the first time and think that due o your excellent negaotiations skill you got them down by 40%. Walk around the corner and the price you just paid will be the starting price elsewhere. Trust me I know! :) At the far north end of 5th Avenue it becomes a bit more sparse. That's actually good for prices. Ther is a hotel/restaruant named \"Los Tulipos\". They have a Cenote' in the reataurant/bar area. Have a seat next to the cenote and have a great strawberry margs. (Cozumel) Great day trip! Take the ferry RT for 24 usd pp. Don't get trapped in the towns center. Rent a jeep for 50-65 usd and travel around the island. You won't regret it! The absolute best part of our trip! There is only one road that will take you around the island. It is absolutely amazing. Waves crashing against the coral/limestone cliffs. Breathing hole where the water explodes up and out. the water is beautiful. There is little to no development on the south/eastern coast of Cozumel. What is ther is a guy selling cold coconuts that he chops with a machete and hands to you. When you are done he extracts the coconut and give you a lime and chili powder... amazing. There is a restaraunt called Senor Iguanas. One of only a few but certainly worth the wait! they have a seafood platter that will feed a family of 10 for 18 usd. Looked amazing! Back to the hotel: The hotel was booked to capacity but you couldn't tell by the looks of it! The buffet was great. Sitting in the center court to dine was fabulous. Never ate at the other retaurants. Beach was beautiful and plentiful seating. The pools were great. It was nice to see normal people. It was no hardbody show... there were a few but mostly normal folks who go to work everyday. Made us feel comfortable not being 21 anymore! :) I have so little to be negative about. I been to many 5 star resorts and this one measures up as long as you are not looking to stay in the room for your entire stay. The rooms are more than what anyone needs in a Riviera Maya. Not the Ritz Carlton/Four Seasons Honeymoon room but more than adequate for anyone... anyone! The only improvement I would reccommend would be to either have more wait staff around the pool bar or hand out larger drinks! :) This is a great place.

To make this report a little more sensible I break it down to \u2018Reception\u2019, \u2018Food and Restaurants\u2019, \u2018Room and Overall Cleanliness\u2019, \u2018Bars\u2019, \u2018Beach and Activities\u2019 and \u2018Service\u2019. Reception: I arrived on Sunday June 1 at 1 PM. The front desk personnel were very friendly and gave me a room that faced the outside on the lower level. The hotel is shaped like \u2018U\u2019 and is 3 levels. The room numbers starting with zero are at the lower level where all the restaurants are. The rooms on the first level start with 1. The main reception is at this level at the bottom of the \u2018U\u2019. And finally the rooms that start with 2 are at the top level. The garden on the lower level is within the 2 legs of the \u2018U\u2019 so if you get a room that faces the garden \u2018Inside\u2019 consider it a good room. The rooms facing the \u2018Outside\u2019 are same as the others minus the view. There are 4 rooms on each level at the top of the \u2018U\u2019 that face the ocean. Having said all of this, I asked for a different room and was told that at 1 PM that\u2019s all they had and I should return at 3 to get a better room which I did. At 3 they gave me a room on level 1 but still an outside room. When I checked in my room I found out that it was a smoking room and I noticed the paint on a small part of the wall was pealing off. I returned to the front desk and told them that I had asked for a non-smoking room. This time the receptionist named \u2018Xavier\u2019, a very nice guy, apologized and changed my room to an ocean front room. So far so good. After this encounter every time I went to the front desk for exchanging money I had a pleasant encounter. Food and Restaurants: There are 5 specialty restaurants that you have to make a reservation for. The reservation is taken everyday between noon and 3 PM at a corner of the bar called \u2018Havana\u2019 located on the main lobby. The line gets to be long and you can only reserve for 2 nights at a time. There are 2 seating for each restaurant each night. I informed one of the two men taking reservation on my first visit after standing in the line for about 15 minutes that since I would be diving every day during those hours it would be impossible for me to make reservation. He said it is no problem and come to the main dinning facility that night and make your reservation for entire week. That suggestion to me deserved a little gratuity which in many instances made things easier and more pleasant and I thank senior \u2018Jesus\u2019 for that. The food in general is very good. The specialty restaurants offer good food and plenty of it. However, I found the main dinning ,which you do not need a reservation for, to be better with better selection and the food that was nothing short of gourmet food. The Seafood night had a selection of seafood that was fantastic and plenty. Room and Overall Cleanliness: Rooms were cleaned routinely twice a day and on top of that I would get fresh towels every night on top of what they changed during the day. A little tip to the cleaning ladies would go a long way. Each room has a bar with 4 bottles of liquor that is replenished once every 2 days, plus many bottles of water and sodas. The property overall is in a very clean state. The only complaint here is the water temperature and water pressure that changes frequently while you\u2019re taking a shower. But nothing that you can\u2019t live with. Every morning before I went to my dive sites I would see an army of cleaning people, who would literally scrub every tile in this hotel. Bars: The Havana bar in the lobby is good for afternoon drinks and smokes. If you are into cigars and smoking this is the place for you. There is a Sports Bar also in the lobby that has pool tables and air hockey as well as computers set up for internet access. The charge for the internet access is $3 for 15 minutes. Cheaper if you go longer. If you bring your own laptop the WiFi in the main lobby is free. There is the Daiquiri swim up bar by the pool that opens at 9 AM and closes at 6 PM. The drinks are generally good and you can also ask for name brands. Again a little tip would guarantee \u2018Don Julius\u2019, \u2018Finlandia\u2019 and \u2018Absolute\u2019 with no problem. The guys that run around the pool and the beach to bring you drinks are absolutely amazing in making sure that your glass is never empty. Beaches and Activities: There are at least 300 beach chairs around the pool and probably 2-3 times more at the beach. I never had a problem finding a chair around the pool or the beach. The pool is a large pool that has water volleyball net and you can actually do laps. There are all kinds of activities during the day around the pool including water volleyball, sand volleyball, soccer, rifle shooting, bingo, and so on. Every night at 9:45 PM there is a show at the theater located on the lower level. The local entertainers perform during the shows and they are pretty good. On top of that the activity coordinators, and there are many, including \u2018Rosa\u2019, \u2018Joshua\u2019, \u2018Pepe\u2019, \u2018Rudy\u2019, \u2018Carla\u2019 and others would go out of their way to make sure you have a good time. Service: The service is first class and everybody makes sure that you are well taken care of. As I mentioned many times a little tipping would go a long way and personally I believe after spending so much money to book a week of vacation what is an extra few bucks to ensure good service and good food. I was there to go Scuba Diving and I used the onsite dive shop called \u2018Scuba-Caribe\u2019. I am posting my diving experience on the Scuba Board. But in short they are great to dive with.

There is also a small market just a hop, skip and a jump from the hotel which has a bank and a variety of souvenier stores.

Then to have 1/2 of the pool area either stand and watch and/or have to listen to very loud people during the ceremony playing volleyball in the pool/screaming kids etc... Night time enterainment left a lot to be desired. You could not get away from it If your room was above the music area or faced the courtyard. The rooms were definitely NOT 5* - I have stayed in plenty of 5* hotels and there is no comparison. Considering this hotel has only been built since 2006 I felt the rooms were very tired. We were on the 3rd floor with a tiny balcony which had high solid concrete walls and therefore you could not sit and enjoy the view. If you wanted to view the courtyard you had to stand up. In 10 days I came across 4 couples who requested room changes due to the noise, no balcony and even insect infestation.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLovely Resort!\u201d", "Author": "mjballet", "ReviewID": "UR16448353", "Content": "Just returned today from 3 nights at RIU Palace Riviera Maya, and it was an Excellent vacation.

We flew in from Des Moines with a layover in Houston. Once we landed in Cancun it took a good hour to get through the line at about 3:00 in the afternoon. Once outside the airport our Apple Vacation rep was waiting to get us to the resort in a van. This was nice because some go in a bus, and have to wait for every stop for the various resorts. Once at the resort is was breathtaking. Pools, beaches, beautiful people, and happy workers. We can not say enough about one particular incident. We did not know that at the specific restaurants when a reservation is required long pants are required. This was our travel agents fault. When we were turned away from the Mexican place a lady named Diana (she handles all hospitality and wedding's) made us feel like the most important people ever. We were given special exception to eat at the steakhouse a little less formal than the other 4 places. The food was clean and delicious (Brazilian, Mexican, Japanese, Steakhouse, and Fine Dining). There is also a buffet that is available without a reservation any day. If we ever missed our reservation we went there. The buffet has everything meat, pasta, fruit bar, salad bar, French bread, ice cream, etc. The hotel bar and swim up bar are fun, and a great way to meet other fun people. We met a fun couple our second night that we spent a couple night out with that made the stay more fun. I keep rambling, but we showed up one night, and got in our room to chocolate coved strawberries and a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon. The activities are kind of cheesy, but a good time. Things like water volleyball, darts, sand volleyball, ping pong, etc. The resort has all the reps to signing up for excursions at a great price so don't do it ahead of time if possible. We went on the Talume Extreme excursion, and we will remember it forever. Zip lines, Mayan ruins, repelling, snorkeling, lunch, and only $97 p/person. Right on the beach you can sign up for anything you want parasailing, scuba, etc. Another great part of RPRY is location. Only 15 minute walk or $5 cab to Playa Del Carmen. Lots of shops, bars, clubs, and the ferry to Cozamel if you want to go there for a day. The other resorts are close and all around, and all their amenities are at your all inclusive disposal (except the reservation restaurants). Just two hotels over is Riu Tequila with the night club that is kind of a disco tech. Some things to know that I wish I had known are following. The resort is shaped like a horseshoe, and our room was near the end of the horseshoe. It was a LONG walk to our room from the lobby. Every time we needed to get our camera, change cloths, or anything else it got old. Also there are free liquor bottles in the room, but the ice is at the stair wells. From our room it was like a 5 minute round trip walk to get ice....I guess I could have just drank it warm. We started putting tips $5 on the fridge, and it was filled everyday with water, corona bottles, pop, etc. It is supposed to be filled every other day. TRY TO GET A ROOM THAT LOOKS OVER THE COURTYARD! We were on the other side, and it would have been nice for people watching from the patio. We were looking at a neighboring hotel. Things I wish I knew: Bring laptop internet is free in lobby. Bring higher SPF sunscreen than you think the Mexican sun is HOT. Do parasailing when you have a chance (it is cancelled for wind and we only had one chance) Bring lots of small U.S. dollars otherwise you get pesos for change. GUYS BRING SOME LINEN (long) PANTS FOR EVENING. Get room near lobby and facing courtyard. Bring Aloe Vera. Sign up for RIU rewards before getting there. Bring cash for souvenirs at Playa.

We are in our 50's and love to have fun. I have stayed at the Iberostar ( which is a beautiful complex with great food but more expensive than the Riu and far from Playa del Carmen) and wanted to stay at the Barcelo(although I think the beach here could be much calmer) but after the reviews I changed my mind. I contacted the Barcelo manager and told him about Trip Advisor reviews and he did not seem to care which concerned me. Anyway I am a flight attendant and have traveled all over the world for 30+ years. The Riu is above average. The pool is much bigger than it looks in the pictures. The beach/pool has tons of room for everyone and shade too. The \"rocks\" manmade are fine, they are saving the beach and they do look like rocks now. But the surf here is pretty rough. We only went in the ocean a few times. And we got a sunburn in just 45 min w/o sunscreen after using sunscreen for 2 days so be careful. We wanted to take a snorkel and parasail trip but in the 5 days there was only one day w/o strong winds and we missed it. So if you get a good day get out and take the water trips otherwise you may not get a chance. I was told by other guests that the parasail was a blast because you are taken out by wave runner to the boat which adds some extra fun. The price was as good at the hotel as anywhere else on the beach or in Playa. Worse case is you can go into Playa Del Carmen and there is a beach there that you can rent equipment and walk out. Check out a snokel/ parasail stand on the beach at the around 10th street. There is a small round bar next to it and a massage area. I felt very comfortable with the guys running the place and would have gone out with them their prices better than the hotel. Due to rough surf in Playa we got a cab for 30.00 each way and went down to Akumal for a snorkeling park there. It was just ok but crowded with locals on the weekend. On the way home from Akumal we stopped into Puerto Adventura. We were really impressed with this area. There are smaller hotels and the beachs are much less rough. There are fun restaurants and bars being a port for boaters. And there are dolphin/ seal parks that are beautiful right in the town, you can swim with the dolphins. I would consider this area next time. Great for families or Singles. Ok as for the Riu restaurants everyone avoided the Brazilian because it was too much meat. The rest were very nice with attentive service and nice atmosphere. We were suprised that the buffet was as good as it was so don't stress if you don't get all the reservations you want. The shows at night were pretty good. Don't miss the Michael Jackson show. I don't like Michael but everyone loved the show. The sports bar leaves a lot to be desired with poor lighting. But it is a place to go after midnight. There is little activity after midnight and unfortunately the disco in the other Riu is pretty bad unless you are under 30. The Riu Palace needs a night spot. MAKE SURE to sign up for the Riu resorts frequent user card at the front desk. You will immediately be able to get a 10% discount on tours and the spa. But you must tell the spa ahead of time that you want your discount. The massage therapists were very good too. The advantage of this hotel is location. You can walk into Playa del Carmen in about 20 min or take a 5.00 cab ride. Its fun to visit the shops and bars with the old/new mexico flavor. Lots of fun at night for the younger people but great for us too. ALWAYS ask the front desk for suggestions. We wanted to go to a bar in Playa that would be better for our age group. We ended up having a ball in a bar with a 10 piece band playing salsa thanks to the front desk staff. The cab drivers are pretty good and if you know the rates they will not rip you off just pay them what they are listed to get from the book in the hotel. ALSO you can hire a driver for the day just at the entrance to the hotel. We met Rodrigo for our Akumal trip. He told us for 125.00 he would spend 8 hours with us taking us to Tulum, Akumal, etc for the day. Chitizentzan(?) is more because its so far. But if you want to get out and plan your own trip look for Rodrigo he mostly parks at the Riu. The rooms are not as upscale as I would have thought for such a new hotel. As 2 single women the beds are close together but not bad. Most of all we had a great time meeting so many people, mostly couples or newly weds. But that was not a problem, people of all ages come together here in fun and you will be invited to join in on the fun.

Unfortunately, our stay definitely did not warrant more than an average rating. Warning: this is a long and detailed review!! Service The service was very sporadic. At times, it was excellent and immediate, whereas many other times it was nonexistent. For example, I called to ask for a room service menu because we did not have one in our room, but we never received it. We requested a wake-up call one morning before a day trip \u2013 and never received it. Thankfully we had set our alarm. One evening our toilet would not flush, so we called around 5:30pm and asked that they come fix it. When we returned to our room after 10pm, it had not been fixed. I called again and said that someone needed to come immediately, which they did. However, my husband had to fix it twice more over the next couple of days. These are just a few of the examples. Dining Overall, we were extremely unimpressed with the food. For breakfast and lunch, only one restaurant is open and it is buffet style. For dinner, you may either make reservations at one of the specialty restaurants or eat in the main dining room (where breakfast is), which is buffet style. As far as the buffets were concerned, I felt this food was barely better than cafeteria food. There are a few exceptions \u2013 like fresh fruit or the hot, chocolate fondue with homemade marshmallows \u2013 but overall, it was not very good at all. We had dinner at all of the specialty restaurants except for one, Chili\u2019s, and that was because we just weren\u2019t interested \u2013 the menu didn\u2019t look too appealing and it\u2019s also where you had to eat lunch every day. The Japanese restaurant was decent. Sir Oliver\u2019s was the best, though still not spectacular. This is sort of an Asian-Fusion - not French. The Brazilian restaurant was pretty weak, especially if you\u2019ve ever been to a real Brazilian steakhouse like Fogo de Chao! The \u201csalad bar\u201d was merely the same thing that\u2019s at the buffet every day \u2013 lettuce, a few veggies, and mystery salad dressings. Same at the Mexican restaurant, which was not good at all. Beach The beach, while certainly not earning any awards for \u201cBest Beaches,\u201d was not as bad as it was made out to be. You can walk a decent length down the beach to the south, past many resorts until you reach a completely empty area. However, walking the beach is not for everyone \u2013 the sandbags, pipes, tubes, jet skis, etc create quite the obstacle course. In addition to the sandbags, there are these pipes/tubes that pull in water from the sea and empty onto the beach. You will be asked every five minutes if you would like to jet ski or para-sail, and the equipment sits along the shoreline for you to walk around. (If you are just lying on your beach chair and pretend to either be asleep or involved in a book, they usually leave you alone.) Also, there is an issue with the kelp, though it seemed to only be an issue at this particular resort. Every morning, workers would be out on the beach and dig these massive holes, then rake up the kelp and put it in the holes and cover it back up. The effort was appreciated, but it didn\u2019t smell very good if you got too close! Pool The pool is nice, but there is music playing ALL day long. If you like to relax in the quiet until happy hour rolls around, you will have to go down to the beach. The pool gets very busy in the afternoon and you can usually only find chairs in the shade along the outside edge. \u201cSexy Bingo\u201d is every afternoon, along with other activities like rifle shooting, futball (soccer), etc. Shania Twain\u2019s \u201cI feel like a woman\u201d got a little old after it was played for the 50th time during \u201cSexy Bingo.\u201d The pool closes at 8pm every night to be cleaned and treated. Based on the size of the hotel, we were surprised there was only one pool. Excursions We had booked our trip through our travel agent and there was a company, Olympus Tours, which had two representatives on site every day. We ended up booking our one-day trip through them, even though it was $60 more to do so instead of booking it online before we left \u2013 try googling cancun-discounts or entertainment-plus. You do, however, have to be careful with many companies offering reduced price or free tours, because they are trying to sell timeshares. Our trip was to Tulum and then to Xel-Ha. Tulum was great. Xel-Ha was fun, but be warned that the snorkeling is practically non-existent and the water is very murky. We also took a cab ($5) to 5th Avenue in downtown Playa del Carmen. (This is also where you can catch a ferry to Cozumel if you like.) We had a good time, but don\u2019t expect to get any really good deals \u2013 we (nor anyone around us) seemed to really be able to negotiate and haggle like we thought we would be able to do. Plenty of tequila to taste and bring home if you like! Overall\u2026 We had a good time \u2013 after all, it is vacation and the weather was beautiful. However, we will not be returning. At one point I made the comment that it was like seeing the previews for a movie, and then watching the movie \u2013 but all the good parts were in the preview. Even though it housed 400 rooms, the resort grounds were not very extensive \u2013 it is literally what is within the U-shape of the hotel. The food was not good. The noise level was very loud, and it was impossible to sleep through the night \u2013 we could hear every person that came in after us and got up before us, as well as cleaning and room service carts. When we arrived, our first room (2069) was above the music club, which is open until midnight, and was SO loud. We requested to move, and they told us they were booked to capacity (thought they definitely were not.) Then they moved us to a different room (1053) the next day. The floors on the top level are definitely the best as they offer the best views, and even if you get a \u201cgarden view\u201d room, if you are on the top level you most likely will be able to see the ocean as well. The beaches in Playa del Carmen are not very good either \u2013 and this resort had one of the better ones. This was our first time to Mexico, so this may be mainly due to the hurricane damage suffered several years ago. Either way, we will not be returning anytime soon.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "macomb, michigan", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Riu Plcace\u201d", "Author": "teeniesmom", "ReviewID": "UR15991490", "Content": "This was our 25th wedding anniversary trip.

As soon as we checked in we were taken to our room where I was stunned with the marble flooring, shower and tub. The refridgerator was full bottled water, assorted sodas and a 6 pack of Corona.

The beach was amazing. Plenty of palm tress for shade and lots of space without trees for the sun worshipers and some hammocks too for the hubby. Beach service was great with no shortage of drinks being served. Very rarely had to ask for a refill. The buffet was there every day with wonderful food of all kinds. Out of the 5 seated resturants there were we at at 4. My favorite was the brazilian. You actually had to turn food away and the flavor was amazing. The shows in the courtyard in the evenings was a lot of fun and the show inside was like a vegas production only smaller. Playa is within walking distance, about 15 - 20 minute walk. If you need there are plenty of cabs - costs about 6 bucks american. I recomend the hot tub after a long day. It was soo relaxing after charter fishing ( where I caught a 43 inch king mackrel).

I'll start with the positives - but there are some negatives towards the bottom. Details: The Crowd - Split between Americans and Europeans for the most part. Not many children, but some. Fairly diverse age group, lots of seniors, lots of couples young and old, some groups, overall a good crowd to vacation with. Hotel / Design / Atmosphere - The hotel is absolutely beauitiful from all angles, but especially from the front and the courtyard. It dwarfs the slighly older Riu Palace Mexico which is also nice, but not this nice. The lobby is also very grand, and very beautifully designed. I'm not sure about the pink, but it's OK. The courtyard is beautiful and a great place to sit in the evenings, have a drink and listen to the band (which is usually pretty decent). Rooms - We stayed in the Jr. Suite. The rooms are very nice, not the nicest I've ever seen, but still very nice. To make it perect I would have an LCD TV, jacuzzi spa, and internet access. Food - The food is very good for a resort. I actually thought the buffet was really good and sometimes wished I was eating there than some of the special restaurants. It had a good selection of very fresh, slightly exotic, and high quality foods. We had Brazillian, French (strangely named \"Sir Oliver\") and Japanese. The only one that lacked noticably was the Brazilian place. Service - is excellent. Very attentative and friendly staff. They understand their guests expect the best and they deliver it. Drinks & Bar - lots of fancy tropical cocktails. Nice bar. I only wished they made aqua de' fresca like cantelope, watermelon or strawberry juice since i was doing a lot of diving and couldn't get hammered every night. Pool - big pool - lots of room for everybody. Beach - Beauitful - there are some but without them people would be getting hurt The Negatives: * Internet only in the lobby - which was a really far walk our room. Not having internet in my room is like not having a TV or a telephone. I know some people don't use the internet, but a lot do and like the convenience of their laptop being online when they need it. * Plumbing / Hot Water - It seems like our shower plumbing was sharing with someone's toilet or something. It would suddenly get really hot then really cold. I hope this doesn't require removing walls to fix. * Fairly big hotel - so pick your room strategically. There's only 1 elevator and that's near the lobby. * The safe uses a key so it's another thing to carry in your pocket.", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic property!\u201d", "Author": "luv2travelMa", "ReviewID": "UR15933492", "Content": "Stayed at Riu Palace Riviera Maya from April 29 - May 5. (2 adults ages me(36) husband (43). Warning* long review & info ahead! Little info on our past travels for comparisons... Mostly do all inclusive resorts and a couple of cruises. We have stayed at almost all of the Sandals resorts (with the exception of their 3 hotels in Montego Bay), Beaches, Super Clubs properties (Grand Lido's & Breezes), Iberostars, few other all inclusives, all Walt Disney World Hotels, Bellagio & MGM in Las Vegas. Airport - We arrived in Cancun Airport on a Tuesday around 11:30 A.M. It was great being a weekday because we were in & out of Cancun Airport within :10 minutes. We do not check bags (we each carry on 1 suitcase that will take us for 8 days). We walked right through immigration, then didn't have to wait for bags so we sailed right through to customs. We had to take a taxi to the resort because we were not eligible for transfers due to a special rate we were given. I believe taxi's are regulated at Cancun airport and the cost for a taxi to Riu Palace Riviera Maya which was about a :50min ride was $82 ! yikes.. + tip. (the return taxi ride from hotel to airport was :45 min and $45...more info on that later. Hotel- Arrival to Riu Palace Riviera Maya- beautiful property, very well maintained, sparkling large chandeliers up above. Friendly front desk & bellmen. Although it was well before check in time our room was ready. We were given a room up on the 3rd floor overlooking the resort next door. (we asked for a quiet room and didn't want to hear nighttime entertainment noise) so the location worked well for us. It was also closer to the pool/beach than quite a bit of the other rooms. Also, when we checked in, & I walked over to make our dining reservations. We arrived on Tues. and the earliest they could get us into Sir Olivers was on Friday night. So if you are interested in dining there I would make those reservations asap. Rooms- The rooms were nice. (I would say comparable to a 4 -4 1/2 star property. Tile floors, double vanity in bath w/ granite, nice hairdryer, sample size containers of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, rain cap, sewing kit, comb & bar soap. Inside the shower was a dispenser which had an \"all in one\" liquid soap, shampoo. We had a king size bed which as soon as we got into the room I felt the bed and it was too firm for me. (thanks to past posters for mentioning). As I unpacked I called to ask for a mattress topper. Living area had a couch (seemed like it was the foam kind of couch), plenty of storage space in the rooms, and lots of hangers. (the good kind that don't have to be attached to the rod). Outside balcony had 2 chairs, table, and drying rack. The refrigerator in the entry way was wonderful. Stocked with Corona (our personal favorite beer), sodas, and 2 different sizes of bottled water which they replenished daily. Above the refrigerator was a bottle dispenser with Tequila, rum, and can't remember the other two. (can you tell which ones I drank?). That night the phone rang..it was the front desk calling to make sure the bed topper was put on our bed. (very nice for them to call & check up) Beach- I was surprised to see what great shape the beaches were in. Since this was our first stay at this property I don't have anything to compare it to for last year, but in our past experiences at other locations we thought it was fantastic. Yes, they did have those large sand bags out in the ocean, but they are obviously working, and by walking up and down the beaches we thought it was one of the better beaches. Especially because the sand bags are further out, some of the other resorts theirs are along the edge of the ocean entry and I thought looked pretty poor. There was not much seaweed. They flew the red flags for 2 days out of the week due to very high surf/winds.. and water sports were not available those days, but made for a beautiful breeze. Drink service was abundant at the Beach & also the pool areas. Some days my husband didn't even ask for another drink and they were bringing another one to him. Plenty of beach chairs & tables. No need to reserve them earlier in the day. They set up a secondary bar down on the beach in the shade with a blender, lots of bottles of stuff, bottled water/soda, and bottled beer which they poured in a cup. If you want to drink Corona and prefer bottled to draft come here to get your beer. (pool serves draft) Pool- We enjoyed spending most of the day at the pool area because that is where activities were going on. Most activites started around 10am, and included air rifle (shooting with a pellet type gun), darts (not your usual darts..spin around in a circle 3 times then try to hit the target!...much fun), beach & water volley ball, horse shoes and much more. They had stretching classes & yoga on the beach, aqua aerobics in the pool daily, bingo with the name \"sexy bingo\" poolside...this is not a game you want to win. The winner has to get up on the pool deck and do a \"sexy\" dance that they teach you..while the music from Shania Twain \"lets go girls\" complete with a little pole dancing. Alot of laughs...if you win, do what we did and give the \"winning\" card to the new people that just showed up that day! (look for the guests without a tan!) ha ha.. worked like a charm. In the pool they also did activities such as bringing in an ocean kayak and having guests do races across the pool to see who had the least amount of time, and they took the sail off a windsurf board and brought it in the pool. They would hold onto it and try to shake guests off. The one who stayed on the longest...won. As you can read they did a good job at keeping people entertained. By the 2nd day a couple of them knew us by name which was very nice considering all the guests at the resort. Pool had alot of space to sit inside the pool & sip a cold cocktail. Drink service was amazing..never waited more than 1 minute for a drink. For drink service at the pool bar they had about 3-5 bartenders, and about 5 servers walking the pool area. Out of all the other resorts we have stayed at this resort BY FAR had the most servers and was nice that they offered the drink service at pool/ beach. Alot of other all inclusives do not offer this service. They do not allow blow up loungers. Restaurants- again as previous posters have mentioned to get a reservation for dinner be at in the lobby starting at noon. You can make 2 reservations at a time. I have to say... This resort has some of the best food than all the all inclusives we have been to. Specialty restaurants did require that men wear long pants. (My husband work khaki's but some men were in jeans). Usually we are not a fan of buffets, but the food was cooked right there and there were so many options...it was REALLY good.. We ate at: Steakhouse- rate:\"A\" We had the rib eye, but they also had on the menu beef tenderloin with lobster tails, and the appetizer they brought out was sushi and shrimp. We were so full that we left before dessert. Japanese- rate \"A\". ALOT of sushi, and shrimp again, but with other things...rest of the food was really good too. Sir Olivers- rate \"B-C\" I would rate this a \"C\", but my husband would rate it a \"B\". I am a plain Jane kind of eater, but my husband isn't. I had a tough time here.. Alot of sauces... We did not eat at Brazilian or Mexican. Alot of guests were saying that the Mexican didn't seem \"Mexican\"...and the Brazilian was just way to salty... Buffet- We did eat at the buffet a couple of nights and really enjoyed it. They had a different theme night every night. Because there is so much variety here even if its \"Italian\" night there that means there are some italian dishes, but they still have a ton of stuff....alot of seafood, lobster tails..(huge with melted butter), salad bars that just kept going. They also had pizza at every meal available. My husband actually said a couple of times that he was sick of eating... (but we couldn't stop because it was so good) Sunday night was Mexican night and was ohhh so yummy.. Breakfast - Buffet had ALOT of choices. In addition to your usual omeltte station, sunny side up eggs, flipped eggs, scrambled with different ingredients such as shrimp,etc they also had a \"sandwich station\" where you tell them what you would like & they make all kinds of breakfast sandwiches... A couple of different options for potatoes, (instead of one kind), pancakes, french toast, pastries with bagels/cream cheese/ muffins/ crossaints/ toast..and a ton of fruit ...much much more. If you are looking for something else other than the buffet you can order room service, or they have continental breakfast served until 11:59a in the other buffet by the pool/beach area. (also known as Chili's steakhouse at dinnertime). Lunch- again...alot of variety....everything from burgers, hotdogs, nachos, seafoods, salads, etc...every day the seemed to change a cooking station. One day you would order burritos, another day quesidilla (can't spell)..you tell them if you want it with chicken, beef or shrimp, peppers, or whatever. If you want to have any laundry done I grabbed a price sheet. Prices are approx. because they are in pesos and I did a quick conversion. (conversion was about 10) Women: dress $5.50 pants $3.50 blouse $2.50 t shirt $2.50 skirt $3.50 Men: shirt $2.50 t shirt $2.50 pants $3.50 *page also states available mon-fri. If given before 9am, returned within 48 hrs. express service add 100%, ironing only 70%.. My husband would put on pants, we'd go down for a drink then dinner and go right back up to change. He got to wear his pants a couple of times since we pack so lightly. I inquired at the front desk how much a taxi should cost us back to the airport and they said about $60. When we got a taxi (they have a couple at the foot of the hotel and whistle down when you need one) I asked how much. He said \"$45\". (woo..hoo!) If you are standing in the lobby and walk out to the left about a 5 minute walk is a cute little marketplace called Playa Plaza. We enjoyed walking down the road after breakfast and stop to shop a little. And if you took a right (instead of a left) about a :20 min walk or 5 min cab ride is 5th ave with plenty of shopping (stores & shops), bars, restaurants. This is also where you can catch the ferry to cozumel. This resort in our opinion was a overall \"A\". The only negatives which I could say are: Inside the pool could be cleaner. There are little mosiac tiles along the areas where you sit in the pool that you can see have a film of oil, mildew & grime. It really should have been cleaned. -Night time enterainment left alot to be desired. Most nights we just milled around and went up to bed. Something with an audience participation would make a world of difference here. -After a couple of days we started noticing our room (especially the bathroom) really smelt of cigarettes. (husband is allergic to smoke)..(we knew the room it was coming from) I went to the front desk to inquire if we were in a smoking room (there were no signs posted) and was informed we were in fact on a non smoking floor. I asked if anything could be done and they offered to move us. I asked if it were possible someone could go up and inform them it was a non smoking room and they said no. They gave me a room to view that was available so I ran up to take a \"lookie, lookie\" as they call it. It was on a floor higher, directly above the stage, it was smaller, and the balcony had a solid concrete wall instead of metal so it got very little ventilation, plus if you sat down you were looking at concrete. Needless to say since we wanted quiet we were not interested. I went back to the room and wrote on a peice of paper very nicely that they may not be aware that this is a non smoking floor. Please contact the main desk if they would like a smoking room. We never smelt them again for the rest of our stay... Unfortunately, we felt like it was up to us to take care of the matter. And can't imagine it being a problem for them to have asked the guests themselves. I'm sure every week the clientele changes, but during our stay I would say that the guests primarily consisted of: 85% couples 10% groups 5% families Nice variety in ages from 20 somethings to about 70'ish. If anyone has any further questions you can contact me and would be happy to help. I would stay at this property again, and in fact met MANY people that have stayed here multiple times.

We planned our trip around our friend's wedding at the resort and we're so glad we added a few extra days to our stay. I'd been reading Trip Advisor reviews of the Riu and was a little apprehensive. Most of the complaints were unfounded. We never smelled the \"odor\" some reviewers mentioned. Our room smelled clean and the open air halls smelled like the beach. The beds were hard, but nothing a nice in-room cocktail won't fix. Everyone on staff was friendly and service minded. The desk clerks were nice and efficient with check-in/check-out. The bartenders were all super attentive. We tipped the bartender at the bar in the lobby and he definitely remembered us. Fabulous Mojitos! The rooms were spotless, but as previously mentioned, the beds were pretty hard. We absolutely loved our courtyard view and spent a good deal of time on the balcony in the morning and evenings. I meant to take pictures of the room, but it looks just like the Riu's pictures. Contrary to some other reviews, we thought the beach was outstanding. Most other guests thought the sandbags were natural rocks. The sand was soft and well groomed. Yes, it's a man made beach. But, if you're staying at an all-inclusive...chances are you're not looking for an authentic Mexican vacation or beach. We took a short walk down the street to a little shopping area near the other Riu resorts in Playa and took the opportunity to walk through the other resort's beaches walking back to the Riu Palace beach. The Riu Palace was by far the best! We enjoyed all of the restaurants we had the chance to try. The only one we missed was the Japanese restaurant. One thing to keep in mind, you CAN make reservations days in advance. We overheard a few people trying and failing to make reservations the same day . The buffet (Don Manolo's) was just as good as some of the reservation required restaurants. They had some great mahi-mahi and salmon options every time we visited the buffet! The Mexican restaurant may be a disappointment to those expecting Tex-Mex. It's great as long as you don't go in expecting chips and salsa with quesadillas...that's Tex-Mex. The cuisine is more authentic Mexican/Yucatan. Our favorite was Sir Oliver's (also the toughest to get a reservation). We had the sea bass and salmon entrees. Fantastic! The chocolate dessert was my favorite and I'm not usually a chocolate fan. Overall, we loved our experience and will recommend the Riu Palace Riviera Maya to all our friends...and strangers too.

Stayed April 28- May 2. The trip was for my Bachelorette Party and there were 6 of us. We booked 3 rooms and at check in, were given connecting rooms without hesitation. Our room was very clean and had everything we needed- nice bathroom, seperate sitting area and of course the mini bar and liquor dispenser that was never used:) We first ordered room service.. the menu was short, but more than adequate. There were a couple salad options, nachos, tostadas, dessert, fruit , sandwiches, etc... I HIGHLY recommend the nachos- the guacamole is amazing.. I could do without the cheese:) Next stop was the pool- LOVED IT! It was the place to be! The swimup bar was fabulous and many places to lounge both in and out of the pool. On previous posts, people named their favorite bartender... Our group grew fond of Marvin- who does not like people who ask for water at the bar, LOL and he makes a STIFF drink! He made the girls multiple versions of the \"Marvin Special\" and he makes a mean margarita:) The grounds were beautiful and were kept spotless- always being cleaned.. That aside, what really MADE the trip was the amazing staff at RPRM. The servers were far better than the majority of servers in the states- they were entertaining and always went above and beyond. We had so much fun trading language lessons and laughing until our cheeks hurt! The Entertainment Staff really worked it- so funny and they really seemed to go out of their way to get to know the guests. You could never be anywhere without a drink in your hand or without a door being opened for you We didnt' do reservations for any dinners b/c we wanted to play dinner by ear. The buffet was really good.. and I HATE buffets. I am a very healthy eater - a vegetarian and I don't eat wheat or gluten. I keep my diet clean and unprocessed and I had plenty of options- breakfast was my fave The beach was ok- water was beautiful, but I have Maui to look forward to in a few weeks for my honeymoon , so I didn't pay much attention :) If you have any questions feel free to ask!", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cDescent stay but better suited for young familes or people over 50!\u201d", "Author": "carokrim", "ReviewID": "UR15637301", "Content": "I stayed at RIU for a wedding last November and can honestly say that I would not have booked this resort if it werent for the wedding simply because I personally prefer smaller resorts with character. I must say that overall it was OK, a little good and bad. Good- Beach was not as bad as I expected. I felt there was plenty or room and not too crowded. Overall not too bad considering how big the resort is. Breakfast- this was the only meal that I looked forward to or enjoyed. Very good- I also thoroughly enjoyed the Mimosas! Cleanliness- our room was spotless and overall I felt the resort was very clean. The grounds are kept very nice. Staff- overall pretty friendly- the waitstaff was great but the bartenders- not so much- probably b/c all the complaining about the crappy drinks started to get to them. Spa- the spa did a great job with the bride and bridesmaids- they were very pleased Ok, now for the not so good- Drinks were VERY watered down and not at all good The decor while nice is very cheesy- no sure why they went with such a cheesy Eurpoean look when the Mayan and Mexican culture is so beautiful. There is absolutely nothing to do after dark- not that I need a big party or anything- but you cannot even get into the pool. The beachside open papala are with cheesy buffet does not allow you to come in for an icecream cone/ drink without a shirt on (guys)- give me a break!!!!! The beds are extremely hard as other have mentioned and it took 5 phone calls over 4 hour time period to get a matress pad. I asked the front desk if there was any way to get a bottle of champagne since it was my anniversary and they said, well we dont normally do that but OK we will send one up- they never did even though I called back twice to confirm it was on the way. DONT tell someone you are going to do something and then not follow throuhg- just say NO, we canot do that! Not that hard! You have to walk a mile to get from point A to point B. Go ahead and plan 30 minutes to walk back to the room to grab those sunglasses you forgot once out on the beach. Re-cap Again, overall not too bad- I didnt hate it or anything I just found it OK and a waste of money- The wedding turned out OK I guess- I am not the type of bride that woudl want kids screaming 10 feet away and 500 strangers spectating the whole thing but she seemed Ok with it.

This was our second trip to this resort (You can see my review from last year on this site.) We booked through Worry Free with private transfers and were pleased with the service. The hotel is beautiful, the grounds manicured and everything very clean. The resort is in the Playacar resort community in Playa Del Carmen. It is just a $5 and five minute cab ride to all the shopping and dining in downtown Playa. Across the street is the resort community\u2019s golf course. Just down the street is the Playacar shopping center which has some souviner shops. It\u2019s a good place to get forgotten essentials without going into town or overpaying at the hotel gift shop. Check in: There was no line at the check in counter when we arrived, and we were given fruit juice drinks. The official check in time is 3pm, but we were there around 1pm our room was ready. We were quickly in our room, and our bags were brought up within just a few minutes. Room: We paid for the upgrade to a courtyard view room, and were not disappointed. Although the view directly out the balcony doors is of the courtyard (which is great), from the balcony we had a breathtaking view of the beach and sea. FYI, garden view rooms are identical to courtyard view, but the view is of the resorts on either side of the RPRM and the lawn and fence in between. The room itself is spacious with the closet (which has the safe and iron inside) and minibar in the entry way. To the right is the bathroom which has a Jacuzzi tub, wall mounted magnified mirror, and double sinks. (Note that the water is not potable but you are provided with large bottles of water in the fridge) To the left of the entry is the bed, ours was a king, with night stands and a dresser. There is also a sitting area with loveseat, coffee table, dresser and TV. The balcony has solid walls between each room and metal railing in the front. There were two reclining chairs and a small table. On one wall is a convenient rack to dry swim suits and towels. Food: Breakfast buffet is great with almost anything you could want for breakfast. Made to order omelet station, made to order egg station, smoothie station, pancakes, bacon, sausage, fresh pastries and breads, fruits, yogurts, cereals\u2026..you get the idea. Formally seated either inside our outside with choices of coffee, water, soda, juice, bloody Mary and/or mimosas. Lunch buffet is Chili\u2019s on the beach. No formal seating just grab a table, but we had quick drink service. Lots of selection and varying stations daily, one day fresh made sushi another day was made to order quesadillas etc. One day there was also a beach grill set up on the beach with burgers. Dinner buffet had lots of selections as well, with nightly themes. On the Caribbean night there were lots of ice sculptures. Formal seating was used and you were given the choice of wine, beer, or soda. If you don\u2019t like your first choice on the buffet, just try again. There were also fresh made to order stations tied to the theme of the night. Again seating is inside or out in the open air. Reservation restaurants were delicious. We ate at the Brazilian, Asian and the gourmet restaurant. The reservations were made in the lobby bar lounge between 12 and 3 daily for up to three days in advance. The gourmet, was Sir Oliver\u2019s now Krystal\u2019s, are the most difficult to obtain. There are two seatings one at 6:30 and another at 8:30. We always ate early, but never felt rushed. There is also a steak house and a Mexican restaurant, but we didn\u2019t try these. Pool / Jacuzzi: Pools are great with lots of room. There is a smaller infinity pool above the main pool with seating overlooking the large pool and beach. The large pool is open with loungers built in on each end. The main pool is connected to the swim up bar which is also connected to Jacuzzis. These are pool temperature. The hot tubs are located in the spa, and use is included for no extra charge. Beach: The upper beach is huge with palms located on either side of an open central area. One side has hammocks in addition to the loungers. The lower/natural beach is larger than you might imagine with the ongoing beach erosion south of Playa. It has a nice entry into the sea, and plentiful loungers. It is probably the largest natural beach in the Playacar resort area until south of the Iberostar resort. I took daily walks south along the beach all the way past the resorts to a great undeveloped beach. Most days there was a bar set up on the beach with ice cold water, soda and beer. In addition, waiters came by every hour or so for drink orders and to remove empty cups. We were pleased with the drink service, especially considering that how big of an area the servers had to cover. Beach/Pool Towels: The resort provides pool/beach towels in exchange for towel cards that are issued when you check in. After using the towel, you are allowed to exchange it once a day for a dry towel. They track towel usage in a log book at the counter. Then in the evening you trade the towel back for your card. Knowing the policy from last year\u2019s visit, we also brought a beach bag and a couple of beach towels this year. Bars: We enjoyed all of the bars, but found the best drinks are made at the lobby bar or the bar in the entertainment building in the evenings. Top shelf liquor is used when asked, as we mostly did, if not the no name well bottle is used. In addition to the many bars, most evenings the resort set up a pre dinner drink display in the courtyard which was a nice touch. These had a featured drink, and was a great opportunity to try something new. Excursions: We booked the Coba/Mayan experience with Alltournative through the worry free rep in the hotel lobby. We very highly recommend this tour. It is a small tour group (traveled in a van, not the big charter bus.) Morning at the ruins at Coba, and climbed the pyramid..just amazing. Afternoon was a swim in a Cenote, rapelling down a cliff and then zip lining over a ravine. We had a late lunch prepared by the ladies of the Mayan village we visited. It was a great day. I also did a two tank dive with the resort dive shop. They have nice equipment, 4 local dives a day and small groups of about 6. They also have packages with diving in Cozumel and cenotes in the area. The dives were great. The guy who signed me up, Alex, and the dive master were great. The regular staff at the watersports counter were best described as less than enthusiastic. I recommend them only if you don\u2019t want to look around at the local dive shops. (The service at the scuba shop was the only kind of negative about the entire trip.) Conclusion: The RPRM is a great all inclusive resort that we highly recommend. Compared to other all inclusive resorts we have stayed and visited this one is top notch. Also no matter which resort you choose to stay with, be sure to visit downtown. In addition to this site, you should also check out playa.info for lots of tips on the area. We would be glad to answer any questions.

This was mine and my spouses first time travelling, along with another inexperienced couple, a moderately experienced couple and a very experienced couple. We booked through our travel agent with Apple. We were booked to stay at the Riu Yucatan, but were upgraded, at no cost, to the Palace. It was extremely beautiful everywhere you looked, from the grand lobby, to the restaurants, to the beach, to the rooms. The food was amazing. We were never bored with the selection and only ate at the buffet. We never had a problem finding a beach chair at any time of the day. The rooms were cleaned daily and we were often left with towel art. Our jacuzzi tub did not work the first day but within 24 hrs it was fixed. The fridge was stocked daily with Corona, soda and water. The key cards to the rooms often would not work for ourselves and one other couple. You would have to swipe approx 25 times before it would register. We eventually got replacement cards. The staff work extremely hard to make sure everything is kept very clean inside and outside of the resort. Everyone greets you with a warm smile and \"Hola\" . EXCURSIONS We ventured into Playa to 5th Ave shopping twice, dinner at Senor Frogs once and had a great time. The guys loved bartering with the shop owners and found an excellent dive supply store on 6th Ave. Going to 5th Ave was just a quick taxi ride of which the doorman would call a taxi on his walkie talkie for us. We took the ferry to Cozumel and enjoyed the 45 mins ride and shopping there. We went on an ATV adventure and that was probably the highlight of the trip. The 4 of us ladies went swimming with the dolphins for a day and it was amazing. The guys went on a 2 tank scuba dive that day and loved every second of it.

We stayed at the RPRM and loved it. From the moment we walked in the door, we were amazed by the beauty of the place. Trust me, the photos do not do it justice. You have to see it for yourself to appreciate it. When we checked in, they offered us an \"upgrade\" to an ocean view room at the Riu Palace Mexico because the view from our room wasn't \"that great\". They offered to let us look at the original room there (RPRM) and make our decision. Well, we were pleasantly surprised by the view. It overlooked the courtyard and we could see the ocean and palm trees. We were so tired from our travels that we decided to stay at the RPRM, and we don't regret that decision in the least. The staff were friendly and always smiling and helpful. Almost everyone who worked there greeted us with a warm \"Hola\" or \"Buenos Dias\". The drinks were great. They can make a mean Mojito or Pi\u00f1a Colada. The wines weren't that great, but that seems to be a common theme in parts of Latin America. In each room, there are full sized bottles of top shelf liquor that you can help yourself to throughout your stay. The food was mostly very good. We were expecting more from the Mexican restaurant, but it wasn't terrible. Our best meal was at the Japanese restaurant. We were very impressed. We unfortunately did not get a chance to dine at any of the other a la carte restaurants, but we were only there 4 nights (and we arrived too late the first day to make any dinner reservations). The beach was nice. Yes, there are black sand bags in quite a few locations, but it didn't take away from our beach experience. I highly recommend doing the Mayan Adventure snorkel excursion offered by Scuba Caribe. They have a location there on the beach at the resort. The bed was pretty comfortable... not what I was expecting from reading the reviews. It did have a foam egg crate pad on it, so I'm sure that helped. Overall, this was a great vacation. Be sure to check out 5th Avenue (Quinta Avenida) in Playa (about a 50 peso/$5 US cab ride from the resort).

I went with my sister and we were just looking for a few days to relax in the sun and not worry about a thing. We didn't want a place with lots of singles or partiers, and at the same time we didn't want to be surrounded by families and/or honeymooners and feel totally out of place. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. RPRM had the perfect mix of guests for what we were looking for - about 60% couples, 20% families, and 20% young friends/singles. This meant that when we wanted to nap in the sun there was always a quiet area, and when we felt like being social there was always a crowd gathered drinking & chatting somewhere (usually by the swim-up bar). The best part of the resort is the service, which was incredible. How the bartenders, waiters, maids, etc. are able to keep such positive attitudes with so many guests coming and going boggles my mind. And they work some looooong hours; the same people who brought us drinks by the pool all day would often be the same people who worked in the restaurants all night. So many people went out of their way to say hello and make sure all our needs were met that by the time we left we felt like we were leaving family. There isn't much to do late at night, but the sports bar was just fine for a few drinks, a couple games of pool, and some air hockey (pool and air hockey require a few pesos each but are worth it). We spoke to a few people who ventured out to clubs and/or bars and they said that worked well for them. Some of the food was disappointing, some of it was good, and a couple things were great. The most disappointing by far was the breakfast buffet. A lot of stuff was cold and it was usually the same stuff every morning. But even if it meant just having a bowl of cereal and some bacon (which was really tasty) we were never hungry. We only had lunch at Chili's, the buffet by the pool. There was a lot of variety and I always found something that impressed me, even if it was just really good french fries! The dinners in the specialty/a la carte restaurants were the best and I recommend making reservations as soon as you arrive. Our favorite was the \"gourmet\" restaurant. We also liked the steakhouse. If I had it to do over I would skip the Mexican restaurant and try the Japanese place (which a lot of other guests raved about). As for the food available 24 hours\u2026 this consists only of burgers, hot dogs, and sandwiches kept in a fridge in the sports bar. There is a microwave to heat the stuff up. It is not good food. If you think you'll get hungry late at night (or maybe need a snack after a night of drinking) I suggest ordering room service (before 11:00) and reheating it in that microwave when you want to eat it. If you don't go expecting too much when it comes to the food (and who would at at AI?!) then you will be plesently surprised. If I could give any 2 pieces of advice, they would be to bring a few extra dollars for tips and to brush up on your travel Spanish. It's not hard to say \"hello\" or \"thank you\" in Spanish, and trying even these 2 little words shows respect and is appreciated. I read many forum discussions on tipping before left and know it is a touchy subject when it comes to AI's. We tipped the pool waiter 10 pesos (about 5 USD) the first day (this particular waiter worked faster and harder than any of the others) and the next day we never even had to ask for a drink - he brought new ones before the old ones were even finished. At the end of the trip we had given away about 500 well-earned pesos (less than 50 USD). Not a lot, but the best we could do, and every one of them was very much appreciated. I HAVE TO SAY\u2026 Please take the extreme reviews - either claiming this is the best place on Earth or the worst place on Earth - with a grain of salt. It is just a very good AI. I would never recommend the RPRM to someone looking for pure \"luxury\", and at the same time I truly do not understand how someone could visit and not have a single good thing to say. We spent about $900 each total (including air & transfer) by booking through one of the travel deal sites and have never gotten more for our money. The RPRM is perfect for anyone looking for great service, beautiful scenery, a great crowd, and pretty good food. P.S.

We have stayed at All inclusive resorts throughout the caribbean and nothing comes close to this hotel. From the moment we walked through the door it was oohs and ahhs. The architecture is so beautiful and the staff tries so hard to make your vacation perfect. We are nitpickers to say the least and we'd have to try real hard to find something to complain about at the palace. The only thing that prevents this resort from being PERFECT is the sandbags in the ocean but the water is so beautiful that we forgot they were even there. The sandbags have definetely served thier purpose because there is so much beach now. There is not another hotel in the riviera maya with more beach. Food: All resturuants are great. Sir Olivers/Krystal is french gourmet at its finest. Chillis Steakhouse is wonderful at night with the ocean breeze and romantic atmosphere. Don Monola Buffet is wonderful for breakfast lunch or dinner. The Brazilian resturuant is unique in that they bring you out several different grilled meats on these long forks one after the other. Everry thing is wonderful. If you enjoy good food You'll love the palace Pool: very big with an awesome poolbar. Santos is the best bartender. Ask for one of his \"special margaritas\". There is also an infinity pool that flows into the main pool. At the spa you have free access to the jaquzzi 's and they are set in a very private atmosphere-very romantic. Beach:Plenty of beach chairs for everyone and never too crowded. There is an upper level and lower level and both are great. The water is amazing with many hues of blue as you look out into the horizon. Many water activities including kayaks, paddleboats, snorkel, and windsailing if the water is calm. Service: This is what makes this hotel so wonderful. Smiles on everyone's face and they try soooo hard to please you. It's like you hurt thier feeling if you are not happy. You are waited on hand and foot. I never had to wait more than a minute for anything. A very charming and funny staff. They work so hard and never ever complain. Entertainment: The entertainment staff kept us busy all day. Pool parties, sexy bingo, darts tournament, volleyball, on and on. The guys had us cracking up all day. At night the place becomes so romantic. Live piano at the lobby bar and before your drink is empty the wait staff is offering you another. If you smoke a cigarettes, when you put it out in the ashtray the come by and take the tray and bring a new one as soon as the cigarette is extinguished. I say this just to give you an idea of how we were waited in there. The shows in the night club were great everynight. The mayan show is a must see.Try the sports bar if you are up late night it is open 24/7 and has great drinks and food Landscape: Immaculate!! fountains and perfectly groomed grass, shrubery, and trees. It felt like heaven all around us. Rooms: very well kept. beds are kinda hard but this is common for mexico. There is a liquor dispenser in every room with top shelf liquor. the mini bar is always stocked and all is included. Try to get a room facing the main courtyard it is well worth it. weather: Don't pay attention to the weather forecasts. It said that it would rain everyday we were there and we didn;t see a drop. THE WEATHER IS ALWAYS PERFECT IN PARADISE. Overall: This is a great hotel for couples to go on a relaxing vacation. There is no riff raff or loudnoise, no large groups or rowdy young kids getting drunk and loud. Nothing at all like cancun. It is a wonderful getaway from the stresses of life. My girlfriend and I needed to get away and have time alone and at the riu palace riviera maya we fell in love all over again.

If you like COLD beer, bring a koozy (sp?) -- you know what I mean....other booze tip, Don Julio is their good tequila and is stashed away. Unless you ask for it, they certainly won't volunteer it and you'll be drinking the cheap stuff. Bring biodegradable sun tan lotion because if you go on any excursions (Xel-Ha, other snorkling trips), they all require biodegradable lotion. We did not, and were forced to buy some which was a waste since we spent 50 bucks on the other stuff. Don't let the cool breeze fool you!! I saw more blistered folks at dinner than I cared to see often because the sun is so sneaky and people don't lotion enough because they \"don't feel hot\". It probably ruined a lot of vacations from what I saw by those folks having to sit in their rooms all evening in Aloe instead of enjoying the festivities. Excursions -- the Half Day Tuluum excursion is a TON of sitting around, picking up other people at hotels, etc. In hindsight, we wished we would have rented a jeep, cruised down there - see what you need to see in about a 1/2 hr - 45 minutes and then maybe hit Xel-Ha for the good chunk of the day. It would probably be more expensive that way (I did not run the cost comparisions), but I personally want to maximize my time on vacation and will pay a premium to not operate at group speed. The roads are well-marked and not that complicated so I would not have the trepidation of driving in \"foreign land\". Others were frustrated on our tour as well as to why it took being picked up at 7:45AM and not returning until after 2PM for what should have been 3 hrs max inclusive of travel to and from (excluding any other side trips). Again, note we did not do research on the logistics of this so if someone else looks in to it and does it, your comments would be appreciated. Food: It was very good. If you go in with reasonable expectations that you are not dining at Morton's, Ruth's Chris, McCormack and Schmicks etc, you shouldn't be disappointed. They have a lot of variety. If you must have top, top end food, why are you staying at an all-inclusive?? Call Four Seasons and pay their prices. Enjoy!!

The hotel is amazing. Very clean from the lobby, bars restaurants and rooms. Staff are very friendly. The hotels are behind a security gate, so you can feel very safe walking up and down the streets to shopping and along the beach. After hurricane wilma, they brought large sand bags in to help save the beach, this was the only downfall for our whole vacation, just because they obstruct the beach and view, although needed to help save the beach from erosion. For our excursions we went horse back riding to la marona ranch, and we also went to Xel ha. for snorkeling, dolphins and it also is all inclusive if you pay a litle more. we did the Xel ha and Tulum ruins together, next time I will do them seperate, as you need a full day at Xel ha to see everything.

From the moment my party arrived we were greatly pleased with the environment and the services of the Palace. We arrived before check in so we had to keep our luggage off to the side in the main lobby where everyone else kept theirs before check in. We changed into our suits and went to eat at the Chilis buffet and spent the day on the beach. After reading many reviews I was a bit leary about the beach. I was very pleased with the state the beach was in. There was plenty of room to walk down by the water and the giant sandbags made it possible to enjoy the water without getting thrown around by the waves. People were always on top of the sandbags playing in the waves so it added some extra fun. The rooms were very clean and spaceous. I was in a room with 3 other guys and we had plenty of room to keep our things seperate. The two double beds pushed together made one huge bed so the sleeper arrangments were a bit tight but we managed. There is also a small love seat down in the seating area which is sleepable if you dont mind having your feet hang off the edge. New towels were brought daily and beds were turned everyday. The mini bar was fully stocked each day so we had no worry about running out of water or beer. The restaurants on the property were always being reserved early so you need to get in line early to get a spot. The Japanese restaurant was our favorite. I never really ate sushi until I ate it here. The entrees were just as delicious as well as the desserts. The steakhouse was our second favorite. The grilled lobster and steaks were full of flavor and fully cooked. The Brazilian restraunt was nothing special. The food was salty and had spices in the meat that dont settle well. If you decide to give it a try, my advice is to stay away from the sausage. The last restraunt we tried was the French one. By far the worst one on property I thought. Many people in our party ordered the sea bass. It was served to us undercooked so we returned it only for it to come back uncooked yet again. The waiter apologized and was angered by the chef's lack of service. The portions are very small so you will be left hungry after you leave. The buffet does not need reservations and it tunred out to be one of the best places to eat. They had a wide variety of food every night and their theme changes every few nights. The pool is a great place to relax and catch some rays. I didn't think I would as much time as I did in the pool because the beach was so close but majority of my time was spent at the pool bar. Peter or \"Pedro\" is the BEST bartender you could ask for. Islas is also fun but I found Peter to be my favorite. The drinks are small so order in large amounts...ask Peter to make you \"especial drink\" and you will not be let down, he takes good care of you. The sports bar is a great place to close out the night (or morning). Eduardo takes good care of everyone at the bar late at night and knows how to have fun if the noise level is kept quiet or else security becomes involved. Ask for Eduardo's Tequila Boom Booms for a little fun. The lobby bar is the place to go for a pre-dinner drink. The piano music is soothing but can become repetative if you stick around too long. All in all the Riu Palace Riviera Maya was a fantastic experience and a destination I plan on returning to soon. Since we visited over Spring Break it was very busy but the staff handled everything exceptionally well. You won't see as many teens at this resort because it is one of the more pricier resorts in the Riu chain but there is still plenty for all age groups to enjoy.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Palace\u201d", "Author": "Sariana", "ReviewID": "UR14591031", "Content": "We stayed at the Palace for 7 nights in January with our 20 month old.

Background \u2013 My wife and I are both 28 and this was our first trip to Mexico (actually first trip Ex-US). We have never been to an all inclusive. We stayed from 3/16/08-3/22/08 Overall Resort/Area \u2013 The Riu Palace Riviera Maya was easily the most impressive resort from the exterior that we saw. It was very clean and employees were consistently picking up trash, maintaining the landscaping, and painting. We were able to walk to all the Riu properties and down the beach at the Riu Palace Mexico and where most impressed with our hotel. Wireless internet in the lobby worked well. Rooms \u2013 We were given a garden view room initially but there was already someone in that room, so they upgraded us to the ocean view room. This room was on the end of the \u201cU\u201d shape on the first floor looking out at the ocean, just to the side of the spa. The view from this room was GREAT!!! Much better than both a garden view and courtyard view. There must not be many of these (very lucky!) As nice as the view was there were a few issues. The smell of the room really bothered me but my wife didn\u2019t mind. It seemed to be a stale musty scent, but when the wind was blowing the first couple of days the ocean breeze made it much more bearable. There were a few very tiny ants that were crawling on the steps down to the sitting area but nothing too bad (they were coming from the cranks in the stone steps). The beds were very hard and the cover was worn out a bit(should have been replaced). However, all in all the view made up for any negatives. We used the safe and felt very safe at all times. Beach \u2013 I was worried about this the most because my wife was very much looking forward to the beach and ocean. Also, the past reviews seem to have indicated a great amount of erosion. We felt that this hotel had one of the nicest beaches (if not the best) in all of Playacar. There was always room and chairs on the lower and upper beach. The \u2018whales\u2019 really break up the waves nicely and it was a lot of fun to climb on them. Note: The first 2 days the water was very rough and there were no water activities other than swimming allowed. After that the water was much calmer and there were boats, parasailing, and water ski\u2019s galore! (I actually preferred the sound and the fun of playing in the rougher water) Food: This was the most disappointing part of our trip. A lot of the food was made very \u2018runny\u2019 so things didn\u2019t look all that appealing and the buffet selection didn\u2019t change much. The first morning I had one of the over easy eggs (my wife did not but everything else we ate was similar) and I got bad food poisoning. I was very sick the whole night and I believe this had to have been caused by the eggs not being cooked enough. Even the scrambled eggs always seemed to be under cooked. Luckily, this hit me early afternoon so I was able to pass out around 10pm and recover the next day but needless to say we lost some valuable vacation time due to this incident. Anyways, I ate a lot of watermelon for breakfast that week and no more eggs. The buffets for lunch and dinner were ok with the ham being the best meat I had all week (but they only had it once). Everything was very runny and the tables tended to be a bit dirty. I would have liked more consistency to the food preparation but I was leary all week from my \u2018egg experience.\u2019 We ate at two restraints the Mexican and the Steak House. We accidentally slept though our Brazilian dinner reservation. The Mexican restaurant was ok nothing great and the steak house was good. Actually, my steak was very tasty but it was served with French fries instead of a baked potato. All in all they could improve the food so make this resort EXCELLENT! Drinks were good and plentiful but my wife and I aren\u2019t huge drinkers so at most we had 4-5 drinks a day and all were tasty. Excursions: Since this is a Riu review I won\u2019t get into them too much but we did the Tulum/Xel-Ha and Jungle ATV tour. Both were excellent with the ATV tour and cenote being my favorite. I would recommend both of them as must do\u2019s! We went to 5th Ave later in the week and wished we would have went sooner and more often and tried more of the restaurants/bars down there. Overall: I think if I were to return to Mexico I would stay at the RPRM again because of the environment and beach. However, we might get a better deal if we didn\u2019t go the all inclusive way and did more excursions and ate on 5th Ave but if I had to advise someone who wanted an all inclusive this would be the place.

When you enter the hotel you cannot help but take a gasp. It is awesome. The lobby area is so big with lovely chandeliers and great seating areas. FLIGHT - We flew out to Mexico with our two friends on a Thomson Flight and it was very good. The extra leg room you now get with them is much better. The tv at back of seats is great. We enjoyed the games and played who wants to be a millionaire (which a lot of other passengers were doing too) quite a lot. Food was good too. Service was also good. CHECK IN - This was very fast and efficient. Staff very pleasant and English speaking very good. ROOM - Our room was a very good size with plenty of storage space for all your clothes etc. Bed was fine for us and had no trouble falling a sleep. Maid kept room very clean and tidy. Towel service was good, towels twice a day. Loved my towel animals they left me too. Fridge was kept stocked on a regular basis. No complaints at all. No musty smell either. BEACH - Plenty of beds to be had on upper and lower levels of beach. Was a worried when i read other reviews about there being no beach at all as my friend loves to swin in the sea. No need to worry as yes although there has been erosion you can still get into the sea and my friend enjoyed herself. If you want a nice stretch of beach go to Riu Yucatan and walk right of their beach and you will find a lovely stretch of beach there. As our friends husband loves to fish we went there and he did catch some fish. Now stretch of beach to walk along too. POOL - A good sized pool. Water a tad cold for me but did go in. You cannot beat sitting in a jacuzzi sipping champers ooh i do miss that. Pool bar area very good. Never stayed around the pool area as prefer beach only for the fact you can get a nice breeze. BAR - The bar in lobby area is a great place for pre dinner drinks and meeting up with lots of people. We met some very nice people while on holiday from England ,Canada, America. Loved my champers. Islas is a very good barman and he knows exactly what everybody drinks, amazing. You can sit around the bar and watch him make all the different cocktails etc., or you can sit at a table in the bar area and watch the world go by. The service is very good. RESTAURANTS MAIN BUFFWET - The main buffet is great for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Plenty of food to choose from. Lovely atmosphere. The artistry they do with the water melons and the ice sculptures are brilliant. The service you get is very good. You will never go hungry. BRAZILIAN RODIZIO - We did not eat here so cannot comment. We heard from other guests that is was very salty and too much protein in one hit. So we decided to give it a miss. CHILIS - Grill and Steakhouse. Very good food and great service. Be aware that this themed restaurant is outside (Pool area) and me and my friend got bitten here. Remember to put on your insect repellent. AGAVE - Mexican. This is a nice restaurant and the meal was very good. We were expecting mpore Mexican food though, but it did not spoil our evening. Service again very good. YASHIMA - Japanese. Have never had sushi before and will not have it again. I am glad i tried it as always wondered what it was like to eat raw fish. Not our cup of tea though. We enjoyed the rest of pour meal there and again service very good. SIR OLIVER - Gourmet. WOW is what i say. We had a fantastic meal here (went twice) and i would suggest you book this one as soon as you can as gets booked up very quickly. The food was outstandingly good. The service was 1str class. I could go on and on. Just go and try it and see what i mean. Our favorite themed restaurant. POOL BEACH RESTAURANT- Great for lunch. Your normal pizzas, hanburgers, salads etc. Food good here. SPORTS BAR- Well this was obviously very noisy. Lots of tvs and some pool tables, another game and the Internet service was in there as well. You could get a snack from the fridge and stick it in microwave. Nachos and cheese also available and of course your drinks and coffees. Lobby bar shuts at mid night so used to go here on our way back to our rooms. Youngsters love this place. OVERALL VIEW - We all loved our holiday here and did not want to go home. We did have an extra day as our flight home was delayed by 8 hours so that was a great bonus. It is the best RIU hotel me and mt husband have been, it was a first for our friend's and they loved this hotel and i am so glad as am always telling them how good RIU hotels are so they said they would come here with us and they were so glad they came and we were too. The staff are so friendly and the it is kept really clean in fact it is spotless. If you decide to go here for a holiday you will not be disappointed.

In the book ,in your room, ( you know the one that tells you about the services in the hotel) it will say that you can go to the resturant early in the morning to go that night - NO, that print is old news.

The entire property was immaculate, including our room, which was located near the pool, spa and beach. This was just luck of the draw! We made reservations at three of the restaurants - the Brazilian, the Gourmet and the streakhouse. The Brazilian was our least favorite due to the oversalted meat and the Gourmet was absolutely fabulous. I had the Chilean sea bass and my husband had the lamb. The presentation was outstanding! The steakhouse was pretty good, too. We enjoyed breakfast at the main buffett every day and I must say they served the freshest fruit that I have ever tasted and their pico de gallo was so good that I had it in some form at every meal. Another reviewer mentioned that the lobby bar had the best cocktails and I would agree with that. We never had an issue getting a chair near the pool or on the beach no matter what time we got there.

While not everyone in the group was pleased, I thought it was a wonderful resort and can highly recommend it. The hotel facilities are lovely with a very impressive lobby and lobby bar area that our little subgroup gathered in every night for before dinner cocktails or after dinner drinks. The grounds are kept up on an ongoing basis and you can see the staff hard at work keeing things neat and clean. I think this attention to detail helps the guests to value the property, too. I was up early every morning walking around and picking out our perfect beach location so I could see the effort the early morning crew took to sweep and wash all the tile areas, manicure the lawn and shrubs, etc. The pool areas are lovely with a mixture of palms and umbrellas to protect from the hot sun, if so desired. There is a tendency for people to reserve seats early in the morning, so if you want the best seats get out there around 7 am to place your towels and belongings. Not all guests knew the basics of pool manners, so there was some nastiness from time to time about chairs, umbrellas, towel snatchings, etc. This doesn't have anyting to do with the hotel, just the manners of the guests themselves. We arrived at noon on the first day, and the only seating we could find around the pool was at the bar gazbo. There weren't any lounge chairs available at that time. The beach chairs were shaded by palm trees. There is also a lower beach area with full sun. The water is lovely, the beach is not perfectly seashell/debris free, but is tolerable for wading or walking or swimming. Other reviews that I read before going critizied the beach, but I thought it was just fine. Our room was on the main floor, but not facing the courtyard as so many TripAvisor folks recommended. Our view was very private with lots of grass and bushes. It was very adequate. Some people we were with had ocean views (at no extra cost), or the courtyard views for the same money we paid. There were a number of people on our trip that had to change rooms. There was nothing wrong with the room contents, but the views were either very poor - overlooking air conditioning systems or in noisy locations. Some people had paid for room upgrades to true suites, but their suites were not available at check-in and were only available several days later. This did cause some issues. While at the pool, I sat next to a couple not with our group, and they had changed their room 3 times because of the poor view or noisy conditions, so this seems to be a consistent theme. The rooms look just like the pictures on the internet, so no surprises there. The food is very first rate. They had an unbelieveable array of foods to choose from and everything was always fresh. The hot foods were hot and the cold foods were cold and we weren't afraid to eat any or all of it. The are constantly putting out fresh bowls or platters as they dwindle down. My only complaint, if it is a complaint, is that there is so much variety, yet the same variety is served both at lunch and at dinner, so that it is easy to become bored with the selection if you take a little bit of a lot of things everyday. I would recommend limiting yourself to a few things at each meal and then trying something else at the next meal. The desserts were not spectacular, but we didn't mind since it would have caused us to overeat just that much more! The best ice cream is at the main buffet (not the one near the pool). Not known by a lot of guests is that the main buffet is open for lunch, too. So, if you want a bit more of an upscale lunch, pass up the buffet lunch at the pool restaurant and walk up to the main buffet for a white table lunch. We ate at several of the special restaurants for dinner that require a reservation. I would not recommend the Brazilian restaurant at all. No one at our table of 8 walked away pleased. However, we had much better reviews for the Steak House, the Oriental restaurant and the Mexican restaurant. The steaks at all 3 of these restaurants were wonderful. Steaks are not served at the buffet. However, the main buffet has wonderful food and if you only ate there, you would do just fine. The best part about the speciality restaurants is that they provide table service and you can sit down to eat with controled portions! The drinks are unlimited, very good and the bar wait staff service is excellent. Just make sure that at the pool you let them know if you do or do not want alcohol in your mixed drinks. There is enteratinment every night that is lovely and above average for these type of hotels. You can sit outside in the courtyard to see and hear the show or you can sit inside the theater area for a closer look. There is also live music throughtout the day and night either at the pool or in the courtyard area. If you are a doer, there are many planned activities to participate in: yoga, water arobics, dance lessons, darts, volley ball, etc. You could be busy all day if you like that sort of thing.

The hotel is gorgeous, chandeliers and marble all over the hotel and it is spotless. The employees were exceptionally nice. I find that if you do not demand things (as sometimes people from the USA do) you get treated alot better. We did tip, but alot of people did not. The restaurants were all good. You have to make reservations, and you can only reserve two restaurants at a time. They have two seatings--6:45 and 8:45.and you are never rushed. There is a Brazilian, Mexican, Steakhouse, Japanese, & Sir Olivers which is very elegant. When you go to the Mexican restaurant you will see that they have a salad bar and a appetizer bar which you can make a meal out of that. We ate so many of the appetizers that we couldn't eat our entree, and it is very authentic Mexican food. There are two buffets the main one is open for all three meals but you can't go in with wet bathing suits and at night no sleevless shirts for men. In the pool area there is a buffet for breakfast and lunch and snacks but not dinner. You can go in there wearing anything. They constantly are cooking so the food is always fresh and not laying around. The pool has plenty of lounge chairs and you can always find shade because there are plenty of umbrellas and palm trees. The same goes for the beach. We didn't have any problems getting drinks, there were plenty of waiters and there is a swim up bar at the pool as well as a regular one. There were plenty of activities going on all day. In the evening there was music in the main courtyard and they had nightly shows which were your typical shows that you find at resorts. Sometimes a little boring but you can take a taxi into Playa de Carmen which costs $5 and there are plenty of places to go to--restaurants, clubs, shopping and this is on 5th Avenue. If you bring your laptop, you can use it in the lobby free of charge. The rooms are like mini suites and they have a stocked refrigerator and liquor dispensers. The only thing I hated was the bed which was hard as a brick. You can ask for a mattress pad which helps. As far as the drinks go, I liked the drinks made at the Lobby bar best and they were open day and night. Overall, this place was wonderful plus we had perfect weather. You can also go to the sister hotels which are on the same street which we didn't do because everyone said ours was the best.

Climbing on and off of the sandbags, getting knocked off the sandbags by waves, going out all the way to the farthest one, etc. were major pastimes for swimmers. Because of the sandbags, this hotel has more beach than those surrounding it. You can walk from beach to beach, but some nearby hotels have almost no beach.

About a sixty minute drive from the Cancun airport -- away from the craziness of Cancun but with enough local activity to be fun. As a new hotel, it was immaculate , kept that way with an impressive work force. Would highly recommend getting a room facing inward toward the fountains etc. Also, the further the room is located from the lobby the less the chance the hallway will be noisy. We also had rooms on the top floor which eliminated the probability from noise from above. The beds are hard as described but a mattress pad which the hotel is happy to deliver and install makes the beds acceptable. The water pressure tends to fall at high volume times so don't wait until the last minute to take your evening shower. Bottom line - if you were expected the Four Seasons, this isn't it but for an all inclusive it is really quite nice. The food is plentiful and varied. Breakfast in the main buffet will appeal to all. Lunch at the beachside Chili's (no relation to US chain) is also appealing and with enough variety to even appeal to our persnickety daughters. The specialty restaurants for dinner are OK with decent steak & lobster @ the American Grill, decent Mexican (not Tex-Mex) at the Mexican, Brazillan only so so and quite good at the \"gourmet\" Sir Olivers. Evening buffet will appeal to all. The liquor flowed freely including beach attendants walking around asking for drink orders. There was zero attempt to make it difficult or cumbersome to get drinks - somewhat surprising in that increased consumption decreases profits. Overt intoxication was quite rare and never bothersome. The beach was better than expected - the actual beach is about 25 yards (23 meters) deep and several hundred yards long - see photos 1 &2. The \"fake\" beach - although it actually doesn't have any overt appearance of being man made - is 5 steps raised from the natural beach and is 65 yards (59 meters) deep with two generous areas laterally placed for those who enjoy some shade afforded by plentiful palm trees and a wide central area devoid of trees for those wishing to bake in the sun. The water is clean and nice. The pools (although contiguous) are freeform giving the impression of spaciousness. Pools are clean and attractive. There is very little of the \"towel game\" for saving of seats - there are more chaise lounges available than hotel guests - and the hotel was full - we didn't even have difficulty getting four chaise lounges together after a morning trip to Tulum. The only place that it was evident was the grouping of chairs immediately encircling the pool. As for the preoccupation on this site regarding topless women, the proportion of topless women increased with proximity to the Caribbean - some but rare around the pool, scattered on the \"fake\" beach and somewhat more prevalent on the beach. Never to the point that it would be offensive to even the most prudish of guests. The staff was exceedingly accommodating. A call to the desk assured our mini bar was over stocked with bottled water. The bar staff and the wait staff was excellent. Tips are very much appreciated - several dollars to the beach waiters and bar staff for a round of 4 drinks, $10-15 for the waiter at on of the specialty restaurants and $3 daily in the fridge of the mini bar. Also to the cocktail waiters in the plaza-type courtyard - a very pleasant site for evening cocktails before & after dinner. So to bottom-line this...no all-inclusive could ever attempt to be a Ritz or Four Seasons and I have been fortunate enough to stay in these luxurious hotels in the past...but it does deliver top flight all-inclusive experience. Many or most aspects of this hotel exceeding expectations. Side trips to the Mayan ruins are fun. A half day to Tulum is nice - but go early as it gets crowded and hot. Be wary of a fellow named Erwin from Olympus Tours in the lobby of the Riu - a real slickster who freely partakes in the bait & switch. There are plenty of other options. Shopping in Playa del Carmen on 5th Avenue is the expected free for all. Much more sedate is the shopping in Plaza Playacar which is located in the opposite direction from Playa del Carmen and a 5 minute walk from the Riu. The Cancun airport is the most efficient I have experienced in the Caribbean - but once clearing the arrivals section and within sight of the outdoors be wary of the desks of shysters who will pretend to be the focus of almost anything including ground transportation but in reality are representatives of time shares. There is no concern for security at the Riu or the Playacar area. At the Riu we freely left valuables such as sun glasses and digital cameras in our beach bag while swimming and never had a probelm. In addition we never heard any commotion that would likely be indicative of any issue with other guests. This evaluation was long-winded but I feel indebted to the previous evaluators and hope to add to the knowledge base. The real bottom line --- We would and likely will return to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya.", "Date": "February 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newton, Ma.", "Title": "\u201c\"No zzzzz's for me at the Riu\"\u201d", "Author": "momdeplume", "ReviewID": "UR13816301", "Content": "I just returned from a week long all inclusive vacation with my family to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. I would give the experience an overall thumbs up, but a few things prevent me from giving this place a glowing review and from choosing this hotel again in the future. This Riu Palace is an attractive looking resort. The lobby is grand in scale and glitzy with large chandeliers, loads of granite, marble and pseudo neoclassical style paintings set into walls which have a pink colored faux finish in attempt to appear from centuries past. There is an piazza like feeling to the outdoor public area once you have exited the lobby on the lower level. There are fountains and with some landscaping which some of the guest rooms overlook. The rooms are spacious and nice looking. The bathroom is a good size with two sinks and a tub/shower. I appreciated the wall mounted make up mirror with magnification. Each room has a mini bar which is restocked daily and a dispenser with several varieties of alcohol which is part of the all inclusive deal. There is also plenty of bottled water in your room for drinking and teeth brushing. (There are signs posted above the taps saying that the water isn't potable). Our room and that of the family we traveled with were identically furnished with Spanish style dark wooden furniture. The two beds in the room were pushed together to make a massive size bed united by a huge wooden headboard. I believe each bed was less than a queen (probably a full), and I'm not sure if they could be separated. There was also a sitting area on a lower level (one step down) which led to a small balcony with 2 plastic chairs and a small table. There was a television and a small couch in the sitting area. Unfortunately, the couch didn't have a pull out bed, something that I think would have made an enormous difference as far as sleeping configurations go. If you have more than one child, or don't care to sleep in close proximity, this would have been nice. Okay, now for the negative part. The bed was truly as hard as a slab of stone! I had difficulty sleeping as a result. In addition, the acoustics in the hallways and the rooms were horrible as a result of no noise dampening materials in the halls and little in the rooms other than the bedspreads (ours had stains) and the drapes leading to the balconies. Any conversation or room service cart in the hall could be heard very loudly. Early risers and returning late party-ers were disturbing, and at one point, since I was so uncomfortable on the petrified wood object that masqueraded as a bed, I was able to clearly hear the late night return of the guests in the room above mine including the clacking of their shoes on the floor and the clattering of a dropped small object. For me, vacations are a time to get caught up on rest, so not being able to sleep comfortably was my biggest complaint. The staff at the hotel were mostly very accommodating and friendly. One concern I had with this resort being all inclusive was that there would be no incentive to do the little things that make a vacation pleasant, but this was not the case here. I would add that our tour representative (Apple Vacations) had suggested on the bus ride from the airport to the hotel that tipping the waitstaff in the specialty restaurants was a good idea, so we did even though I'm not sure it was necessary. This Riu has a number of options for dining especially at night. As I mentioned before there are specialty restaurants. There are five in all, and I tried 3 of them before deciding that the buffet was a better choice especially when dining with children. It is necessary to stand in line to make reservations at the specialty restaurants 1 to 2 days in advance for either of the two sittings available each night. The Brazilian and Mexican restaurants were just fair. The Brazilian restaurant seemed to be all about too many types of meat which our waiter served to us from long swords. The steak house restaurant was better, but nowhere near the quality of a good steak house in the States. We decided to skip the \"gourmet\" restaurant called Sir Oliver's in favor of trying a well reviewed Mexican restaurant in town. The buffet style dining was somewhat overwhelming catering to a variety of tastes and the resort's international crowd. One can always find something, and there were always opportunities to try new things. The food, on the whole, was good. If you're a decaf drinker, forget about it unless you go into town where there is a Starbucks. The stuff they serve here tastes like Sanka. Yuck! The advertised Kids Club was very weak. The woman running the program seemed less than enthusiastic and didn't speak much english. My child is almost 9 and wanted nothing to do with activities which included a very lame Mini Disco run by 3 staffers in silly outfits. My spouse and I had hoped for some \"adult only time\" while our daughter was happily engaged in fun activities with other children. This did not happen the entire week since there was no programming for her age group. The family we traveled with had a 5 year old who participated in some loosely organized craft projects. The most inexcusable event, however, was when I spotted our friends' 5 year old alone in the shallow end of the pool (no life guards here) having been released from her craft activity early when the woman in charge had to leave to set up for a lunch event. Another family we met told us a similar thing had happened on a different day with their 3 year old! The water and beach were beautiful. I believe there has been some work done to restore this area since destructive storms of last year. There is also a grove of palm trees with hammocks to relax in. It was not difficult to get a lounge chair on the beach. Around the pool was more difficult, but usually spots were available on the fringes. There are two main pools which are adjoining. We spent more time in the upper one since it seemed cleaner. The lower one has a swim up bar area which explains why you might run into a floating soggy nacho chip or the occasional cigarette butt. My daughter loved being able to swim up to the bar to order non alcoholic daiquiris. My spouse used the gym equipment and found it to be adequate. Although I did not have the opportunity to use the spa, there seemed to be a number of services and treatments to pamper yourself with. There are 2 nice jacuzzis as well as a sauna available if you haven't gotten your fill of heat. Shopping is either a short walk or a 5 dollar cab ride away for a better selection and the opportunity to hone your negotiating skills. Bargaining is elevated to a fine art in the Fifth Avenue district where it possible to purchase some cheap souvenirs as well as nice silver jewelry and Mexican handicrafts. Bring dollars with you especially in smaller denominations unless you want change in pesos. The dollar still has some clout here. There are opportunities for a number of excursions to archeological sites, beaches, adventure parks, etc. My daughter wanted to swim with dolphins which wasn't too long a bus ride, so we did that for an afternoon. A number of tour package operators have desk hours in the hotel lobby and are available to describe and sign you up for these activities (additional fees apply) if you want to participate. So although I have a few gripes about the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, I would say that it is a nice resort. If you are a sound sleeper and don't have younger children, this resort would be a good choice for a warm weather vacation.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Del Mar", "Title": "\u201cDid not love ths hotel at all.\u201d", "Author": "DelMarGirl", "ReviewID": "UR13811600", "Content": "We love to travel, and have traveled at many all-inclusives as well as regular hotels. We and 2 other families were meeting at this hotel as a reunion. Let me start by saying, we really were excited just to be able to meet as a family because this was sort of a reunion for us, as we hadn't had a vacation together ever. We pulled up to the hotel, and our first negative experience was that there was no bellman to greet us, nor anyone to help with our luggage. We do know now after spending 5 nights at the hotel, that this was not usual, as we saw a bellman the majority of our time after this arrival. (Also, the entire time we were registering, we didn't see the bellman either, and that was about 45 minutes total). We arrived at around 4:00pm, and their were other guests as well arriving, that didn't have a bellman either. We were then given our room cards, and again, lugged our luggage up to the room without the help of the bellman, as the front desk told us that we had to wait until he came back, again it had been almost 1 hour, and we were ready to change our clothes as go to the pool/beach. We walk up the long corridors to our room, and our all of our card don't work (we had 2 rooms, the other family checked in the day before.) So we had to go back down to activate our cards. Needless to say, we had already been to the hotel for more than 1 hour (with kids in tow) and hadn't even gotten to our room. Basically, to shorten this already long story, the rest of the trip was just one poor customer experience after another. They give towel cards to each person in your family, which allows only 1 towel a person. The lounge chairs were long, and I felt more comfortable having two on the chair, but they never allowed us more than our four towels, even if we needed another one to go to the beach, or whatever. I never dreamed that giving towels to guests would be such an issue. Every time I asked, they flatly said \"no\", without any explanation or apology. I was appalled when the towel girl (very rude!!) started giving me dirty looks every time I came each subsequent day to pick up my four alloted towels for my family. There was a restaurant next to the pool, and there were a few times we liked to take a plate of food next to our chairs. On one occasion, we went again to bring a plate of food, and they refused to give me a fork. I was so numb from the extremely poor service, that I just walked away shaking my head. The pool itself was very nicely designed, but it was freezing cold, and took some time getting used to it. The ocean water was actually warmer than the pools. The ocean was very rough most of the time we were there, and prevented us being fully enjoying the waters. The sand was soft and beautiful. The bar service at the lobby and the sports bar was the best, and we really enjoyed our pre-dinners sitting there and having drinks. But I really am disappointed that the only beer they served in the entire hotel was Corona only! Especially in a country which has such amazing and tasty beers. For the price we paid for all-inclusive, I am quite amazed at the food as well. While the buffet was visually beautiful, I felt it was just a variation of the same foods from day-to-day. In fact, they had so much fried foods and every vegetable dish/meat dish was just swimming in butter or oil. We went to eat at the Mexican restaurant, and the food was horrible. The fish was fishy, dry, and too salty. Chili's Restaurant (which was the lunch restaurant converted into a steak house at night) was quite good, from the beautiful and tasty seafood appetizers, down to the beef medallion which was cooked immaculately to the lobster which was a little chewy, but tasty. We mostly went to the dinner buffet at the main restaurant, due to the kiddos. Anyway, overall, I would not return at all to this hotel, nor to any Riu properties, as I have been scarred by this trip in a way due to such poor customer service. The hotel industry is supposed to be a service industry, and I am quite appalled at how poorly the staff knew about this key aspect to tourists. We spoke with several other people while on the trip, who did express similar situations, and therefore, knew this wasn't just isolated to our family.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Time, Great Resort!!!\u201d", "Author": "Voodoo7", "ReviewID": "UR13734505", "Content": "Well, where do I start?

I can only think of one time in our entire stay where we said, \"Where's the drink guy?\" My wife was hooked on the \"Passion Dreams\" and I tried a little bit of everything. (I did find myself ordering either a Mojito or Caiprinia quite often) They were not skimpy on the alcohol either. As for the food, it was very good. There were plenty of choices at the buffet at all meals. It never got boring as I have read some people complain about in past reviews. It really is what you make of it. I come from Atlantic City where the buffets are huge. Don Monolo was 100 times better. The gourmet restaurants were great! We tried Botofogo (good), Agave (very good) and Chilis Steak House (excellent!!!) It was very easy to make resevations too. We just went down at noon and booked for that day and one day in advance. The entertainment is a little limited but we liked that. They had a show at 10:00 and a band before that. It was great to be able to sit out in the courtyard and enjoy the weather, the show and of course a few drinks. There were no rowdy crowds which is good. If you're looking to \"party\" go to Cancun. There were a few kids but they were no problem. We only saw one couple become annoyed because the kids were right up on top of them in the pool while the rest of the pool was empty. No biggie. As for the room: It was really nice. A little small but not bad at all. Nice and cool with a decent stock of cerveza and soda. Our patio was nice. We had the garden view which was in fact looking at the property next door but we found that we had more privacy then the courtyard view. IWe liked it. As for the now infamous \"musty smell\", it was there but not a deal breaker at all. It is the tropics, I've been to Panama three times so I was ready for it and my wife was bothered a bit. We did have one issue. On our last night we had a leak in our ceiling due to our AC freezing over. the floor was soaked. The desk did not answer the phone so we had to go down and tell them about the leak. They immediately moved us to another room, which was really bad. It was on the ground floor and had a tiny patio with no breeze. Due to the language barrier we opted to stay in our original room. We asked if someone would be looking at the leak and we were told it's late (11:00 pm) That was unexceptable. It was late for us as well, we were to depart in the morning for the airport. Well, needless to say, a maintnance worker did come up and fix the leak. It took all of 30 mins. No biggie. Hey, &$%^ happens! As for the desk. Check in took all of 5 mins but they do not answer the phone as others have stated. All in all a great stay! I would go back again without hesitation. I feel that reviews here have been very helpful. I do not understand any bad remarks. It really depends on your mindset. If you go in looking for problems, you will without a doubt find them.

Every night had a theme, International, Oriental (great sushi), Italian on Saturday, Mexican, and a couple others I can't remember. Downtown was ok, but all those vendors bug you to no end, we went first thing in the morning when it's calmer. The ferry to Cozumel is packed all the time and the waters are choppy so if you don't like that then take gravol. The plane ride was terrible, crammed in like anchovies not sardines and the way back we had no audio or video. If you can deal directly with the hotel and seperate flight then do it, don't do the package deal especially with Sunquest. And do it online, you will get an upgrade and better price. This place is fantastic to plan a Wedding, I've seen about 10 in total and Diana is the planner and she goes all day checking everything.

I can't say I am doing back flips, and it's probably just not fair to rate or judge this place after staying where I stayed in Fiji just 2 months ago, so you may want to elevate your expectations 1 notch when reading this. The value for the dollar is good. We usually watch the usual vacation mediums to try and secure the best deal we can when we are using our vacation days. Usually the deal dictates where we go. If the Caymans are running specials, we go. If it's Hawaii, then we go,ect... In this case, we were attending a wedding and were required to stay at this particular resort. We tracked it for about 9 months before finally deciding to pull the trigger on a travel deal to this resort. Over the course of 9 months, RIU ran many specials to many resorts, but not this particular one for the travel days we needed to be there. In fact, over the course of 9 months I only saw one special, so we ended up paying top dollar for our package. With that said, the value was still good. When you first get there the first thing you notice is the lobby. It's huge; it's beautiful and has lots of Marble and a true palace theme. The resort is very well manicured and the property is immaculate. The rooms were large and were able to accommodate myself, my wife, my 2 year old girl and my 1 year old son without suffering much claustrophobia. The rooms were well kept and the bathroom generous. The only problem was that it seemed that some rooms had a \"musty\" smell like you always seem to run into based of age of a resort and some did not. Just a general observation, but it seemed as though the rooms on the north side that weren't getting as much direct sun suffered this problem, and my wife and son were slightly allergic as a result. I was in several rooms on the property due to the fact that we were attending a wedding with lots of family and friends, so the difference was noticeable. If you are allergic, I would ask for a room change if you happen to get a room like ours. Otherwise, the room was great. The resort itself has many amenities. It has 2 large size pools, a dive operator onsite, and many activities and excursions can be booked right from the property. They also have a rental car company right in the lobby, and fast affordable internet. The beach could have been better. The beach is a decent size but they have barriers to help calm the incoming waves, and they are just an ugly mess. While they serve a purpose, there must be some way to quell the eye sore factor of these beasts. Also, they could have done a better job grooming the shore line as there was a noticeable but not abundant amount of seaweed, (and other regurgitation from the sea). The view was great and you could see Coz in the background. They also had a great Jacuzzi area with 2 large sized Jacuzzis inside the Spa section which I truly recommend. The pool doesn't go over 5 feet, which is a personal complaint, but certainly not a deal breaker by I don't think, anyone's standards. The poolside service was OK. I think they might have been a little understaffed, or maybe just slow. It could take anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 minutes to get your order. Choices were limited and you had to physically walk to one of the theme restaurants that were opened during the day for any real poolside sustenance as poolside had Nachos, and that was about it. The food was hit and miss. The breakfast buffet was as good as a buffet I have had at any resort at any level. The lunch buffet was extremely average to slightly above depending on the day. The choices Dinner time was hit and miss. When they were running a theme night, the food seemed to be better. Mexican night was great and actually authentic. A lot of resorts even in Mexico seem to dumb down the menu for the tourists pallets, but they seemed to go authentic and it showed. On other nights the buffet was just average. We only had time to go to one theme restaurant just because the length of our stay and the fact that we could never seem to make enough time for a reservation, but the theme restaurants as expected seemed to be a little better. The service, (food wise) was also hit and miss. When ordering room service, the choices were slim and the wait was an eternity. The theme restaurants were completely on point and the service was first class. The buffet was normal. Poolside sucked. The bars were average. It just depended where you were. In a nutshell, they needed more choices for poolside and in room dining, and needed to do it faster. Everything else was fine. This was the first time we brought the kids along oversees. This resort was very accommodating and kid friendly. There was plenty of room for them to run around, and plenty of room in the pool that we could play with them safely and away from adults without kids. They also had no problem getting a satisfactory bite to eat. Overall, we found this place to be a good solid deal. You get what you expect for your money, and probably not a lot more than that (unless you find a deal); certainly nothing less. It was great with the kids and the food was fine. The amenities above average and the resort is beautiful. You add in the magic of the Maya experience, all to see to do around there, the ease of getting to Coz or the cenotes for diving, and the proximity to Xel-Ha, Tulum and Excaret; it is a definitely a resort worth returning to.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cMake your Stay Even Better\u201d", "Author": "MyBoston", "ReviewID": "UR13402503", "Content": "As I type, I'm currently sitting in the lobby of the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. I am coming to the end of my stay here at the palace and wanted to pass along a couple things I\u2019ve learned from my stay. First of all I would highly recommend the hotel, as other reviewers have stated it is only a few years old and is very grand. Lot's of chandelier\u2019s and marble, the staff is constantly cleaning the entire place including mopping down the walkways seemingly ever other day. Each room has a daily stocked mini-bar re-filled daily with soda, water and 5 Coronas. I tried to drink my coronas ever day, I wanted to feel that I was getting the most from my vacation. Additionally there is the Legendary Alcohol Dispenser in ever room, Yup, you heard right. Every room has a dispenser of 4 bottles of alcohol which you can drink, guzzle of just stare at. Mine had a bottle of Bacardi White rum, Quervo Tequila, Brandy and Vodka. All popular brands. The only bad part is that unless you want a rum and Pepsi, theres not much to mix the alcohol with in the room. So feel Free to bring your mixers and a few aspirin for your headache the next day. Order yourself a Dirty Monkey (or 6) from the lobby bar. It's basically a Mudslide with Chocolate and Banana in it. Very Tasty. The beds are hard, so do yourself a favor feel free to ask for a Mattress Pad to be brought to your room. I slept the first night without the pad and the remaining with and it makes all the difference in the world. Also, ask if you you can have a Courtyard view as opposed to the garden view which looks out over the backs of neighboring hotels. I'm sure all the rooms are nice but I\u2019ve heard that some of the garden view rooms are too close to the water purification plant on the outer edge of the property. I asked for a courtyard view and whether it be by good fortune or my request I got a great room on the first floor overlooking the courtyard fountains near the pool. I was very pleased. Be sure to book your reservations for the Restaurants in front of the lobby bar between 12 and 3. If you don\u2019t, you will be either dining at the buffest again (Which is still very nice) or you can take a 5 dollar taxi ride or 20 minute walk to the 5th Ave which is very cool and offers lots of Restaurants and shopping. If you do take the taxi Ride, don\u2019t feel the need to tip the driver. 5 dollars is much higher than the 12 Pesos (Roughly $1.20 ) that the very same length taxi cab ride would cost in a non tourist area. I learned this from a local. If your going to be paying with cash, you will get the best exchange rate at a bank. Everywhere else will round down to roughly 10 pesos for every US dollar which while easy to do the math, means your losing money every time you pay for anything in USD that is priced in Pesos.

My experience at D.R was terrible simply because I had bad weather, food poisoining and a few other bad experiences, and i wonder if it was cause I stayed at 4 star resort? This time I decided to stay at a 5 star resort, the Riu Palace Maya to see if it was worth the money. I will base this review into a few categories. Resort: Yes, the resort is a 5 star quality...beautiful place and super clean. The staff is always cleaning and keeping the resort looking good. Only problem is that it did stink a little and I wonder if it was cause of the water they were using. The Rooms were very nice and comfortable - I know a lot of people were complaing about the hard beds, but I found them comfortable. Although, I do like my bed a little stiff. Service: The service was perfect! I found that the service around the bars and restaurants were excellent. They're always making sure that you;re happy and always making sure that you;re taking care of. You can even get a drink laying on the beach, one of the bar staff will come around and get you one..that was great! Food: The food was good. The buffet can be a little repetitive at times but you do have 5 restaurants to eat at. First, I only had the chance to eat at 3 out of those 5 restaurants. I was a little disappointed with the steakhouse, however, the mexican and sir oliver were amazing. Those two were a 5 star quality! Activities/beach/pool: The activities were ok, they weren't much going on and I wonder if its due to the fact that we went during a slow season. The beach was good, I know that they've been hit by the recent hurricane but because I actually walked on some other beaches I really appriecated our beach and the resort did a good job of maintaining it. The pool was awesome, very large pool plenty of room and chairs to go around. Overall: I thought my vacation was awesome, perfect weather, perfect resort, problem free.

Negative - the rooms were really worn. The bed and pillows terribly uncomfortable. We booked and paid for a party of 4. The room did not have a sofa bed and only one rollaway fit in the room. One of my kids ending up sleeping proped up on a love seat. The hotel shampoo/soap is a large dispenser in the shower. The walls are very thin and you hear everything going on in the hall 24X7.

Since it is all inclusive the majority of the guests are fairly intoxicated by early afternoon, so if you don't over indulge I would not recommend this place.

The front desk never answers the phone so if you need something you have to walk down to the desk and stand in line to request it. The front desk staff is extremely rude.

Our one complaint was with the showers (which we noticed other people experienced also) and that was when you were showering, the water would become scalding hot without any notice. The staff (with the exception of the front desk) were wonderful and took very good care of us (especially Damian, Xavier, Alex, Martin, Jesus and Rosario). They were helpful, friendly and always had a smile on their faces. The pool was very clean and the area surrounding it was sufficient for the amount of guests. There were always plently of chairs at the pool and on the beach and plently of shade with all the palm trees around. There were not many staff members on the beach to take drink orders but the bar was within close proximity to the beach and you never had to wait long to get a drink (which by the way were excellent). The beach was sufficient for our needs and the water was gorgeous. There was some seaweed but it was actually kind of pretty seaweed (nothing like what you find in the Atlantic ocean). The food at all of the restaurants was exceptional. Our favorites were the Japanese, Mexican and Sir Oliver's. We would recommend making your reservations for dinner at least three days ahead and opt for the early seating. That way, if someone is not happy with the meal, they can go to Don's for the buffet (which was always great). The breakfast buffet at Don's and the lunch buffet at Chili's were also excellent. Plenty of variety at both. The shopping area in Playa del Carmen is about a twenty-five minute walk (which was pleasant) and the shopping is great!

In fact, we thought the food was pretty good for a large resort. Sometimes when catering for so many different nationalities, the quality suffers, but we found they covered the bases pretty well. The breakfast buffet was the best and just outstanding. We tried three \"gourmet\" restaurants...the Brazilian grill, Mexican and Chili's. It was so cold the night we had steaks at Chili's it was hard to enjoy the meal. But, my steak was quite tasty and the wine flowed freely. Be sure to ask for the \"Chilean Merlot\" which is better than the house red. As indicated on other reviews, the property is lovely. The entrance is grand and the pool and grounds are meticulously cared for. But, the beaches have been washed away by the hurricanes and access is limited. You also have to wade through seaweed to get to clearer water. Check-in was long and tedious. Don't lose your key to the safety deposit box or they'll charge you $50. Lost card keys for the towel locker will also cost you. I was disappointed that none of our rooms had a view of the courtyard or the Caribbean, only of the complex next to us and a water purification unit. I complained immediately of an odd smell after we got to our room; only to find out that our \"new room\" down the hall had the same odor. It must have been their cleaning solution, but it ended up permiating our clothes and the smell followed us back to TX . As stated in previous reviews, the beds aren't \"heavenly\", but we slept pretty well despite the firm mattress. I don't like \"bedspreads\" and the blankets were old, but this is a beach resort and not the Ritz. The fitness center was quite inadequate for the size of the resort. Only a handful of machines at best. It did have the nicest view, which made an ordinary work out routine more enjoyable. But, get there early or wait till mid-afternoon when everyone else is at the pool. We played golf once across the street. The twilight rate was $130 pp and we didn't finish the round. Toughest course I've ever attempted. Lots and lots of sand and other natural hazards...large iguanas! Several par 5's were over 500 yards. But, the course was well kept and more than a challenge for this duffer. I would recommend this property for families. The decibel level is pretty high. The corridors are noisy and no matter how hard you try not to wake up your neighbor, the door always slams shut. No use trying to take a siesta during the day, there are always kids running up and down the halls or suitcases being rolled to rooms by guests. There isn't much to do at night. One evening's entertainment was the \"Michael Jackson\" show, which was a very good impersonator. But,, the other shows reminded me of \"cruise ship\" entertainment. In fact, the whole experience was like being on a cruise ship without the motion sickness. If the weather had been a bit more cooperative it would have been a better time.

When we checked in, we were ignored, our rooms weren't ready, and they left our luggage sitting in the middle of the lobby for four hours. The rooms were kind of dingy. No extras. Not even clean. I had to dust the divider which separates the bed from the couch. There was no water in our fridge. I had to take an Advil, and when we told them we had no water, they told us that we did. Well, guess what??? No, we didn't!!! There were also hundreds of little ants in the rooms. I know they can't help this, and I saw a can of Raid on all the cleaning carts, but the ants were pretty bad. Our room was only cleaned twice through the week.

The rooms were well kept but the beds are incredibly hard. Also the walls are paper thin, so you can hear everything very early! For some reason they like to start lawn care at 7 AM. They had entertainment every night and it is poorly done. Also some of the staff is quite rude, if you want to have a fun dinner and be able to laugh do not go to the Japanese restaurant, we were scolded for laughing. Very rude. The front desk is not much of a help either. Every night they allow vendors to set up and the prices are very high on the jewelery, do not buy anything! We bought a very nice ring that was originally ~135 and they sold it for ~50. That night all the jewels popped out. The beaches were okay, rocks were in the water so you would have to walk a little to get to a part with no rocks but were then forced to walk through a lot of sea weed. That resort was hit by the hurricane so they have ugly big bags of sand in the ocean. If you take a left out of the resort they have a HUGE market about 2 miles down.

I have stayed at the Riu Yucatan the year before also in the Mayan Riviera, so I knew what to expect with regards to dining and resort standards before I arrived. Riu's are great value for your dollar. The lobby was very nicely decorated. The service was also very nice as most employees were very quick to serve. The food was amazing. I truly enjoyed the buffet! I cannot comment on the a la cartes as I did not visit any. The room was very large and nicely decorated. Whirlpool tub and double vanity, in the washrooms. The beds were a little hard, but nothing out of the ordinary for a Mexican resort. The grounds are kept immaculate and are cared for very well. The pool area was very nice, and the bars were kept clean. I especially enjoyed the infinity pool. I was extremley disappointed with the beach however as there is no beach. It has been completley erroded away, so if you are an individual who values the long walks on the beach, it is non-exisistent here. You can however, take a 10 minute walk over to the Riu Yucatan and use their beach which is still not the greatest, but is much better than the Palace. The resort is also very large and it can be confusing to get around at first. My room was located at the front of the resort furthest from the beach. My room did have a balcony but it was about 1 foot long and I could not go onto it as it was so small. The location of the resort is great. Being located in the resort/community of Playacar was very nice. It was a quick cab ride to the lovely town of Playa Del Carmen ($5 per way) and about a 30 minute walk. I do highly recomend visitng Playa Del Carmen for shopping, especially at night. It is a very nice and quaint shopping/dining strip. Over all I did enjoy the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, but would not return due to the beach situation. I would not hesitate, however, to visit a Riu Palace resort elsewhere.

There was a beautiful buffet luncheon where some of the the tables over look the beach/ocean which was a welcome change from the tight aircraft accomodations. The hotel was beautiful, clean and had well appointed rooms with all of the necessary amenities. Every evening there was a buffet, I recommend checking with the front desk about the theme of the evening, as well there were 5 al a carte restaurants (Brazillian, Japanese, Steakhouse, French and Mexican), we tried the French (more formal atmosphere), Mexican (dinner starts with a buffet of appetizers, careful it's easy to fill up before your meal arrives) and Japanese (dinner starts with sushi and the beef is quite tasty) and were pleased with the food and the service at all. There is plenty of space for those who love the sun, loungers around the pool and on the beach as well as built in tiled loungers...we never had a problem finding a spot together but I would suggest checking out the pool area for \"your\" perfect spot and getting your towels on the way down to breakfast, and placing them on your favourite chair, perhaps with a book or hat to save your spot...we did this after a few days of choosing random seats and always found our things just as we had left them. You can walk up to the Daquiri bar to get yourself a beverage but they also have chair service around the pool, the wait staff are quick, efficient and friendly and you may find as they get to know you that just as you finish your drink they've arrived with a fresh one. La Habana bar in the hotel lobby was a favourite of ours for before and after dinner cocktails, there was one particular bartender named \"Islas\" (pronounced exactly how it's spelled) who will make you his own concoction if you tell him what your tastes are, and they lso have a very nice cocktail/martini list with many choices to suit everyone's palate...my favourite was the chocolate martini and my spouse's was the cosmopolitan or and something that Islas called \"pimp juice\" We read many reviews about the hotel before booking and were nervous about trying a couple of the on-site restaurants because of negative comments (steakhouse), but people we spoke to at the resort during our stay said it was fantastic. Another guest actually made a wise comment in that if you book your dinner reservations for the early seating, you can always head to the buffet afterwards if you're not completely satisified, I would take any negative reviews you read with a grain of salt, keeping in mind that if you want things to be exactly as they are at home, you are probably setting yourself up for disappointment and wasting your money travelling, regardless of the destination.

This is our 3rd time in Cancun/Playa area, and the best so far. Riu has done a great job at this resort. The grounds are beautiful with truly palace like setting. The pool was big and nice, plenty of manmade beach, and service was impeccable. To simplify our experience: The bad: 1. Noise: walls are thin and can hear noise in the morning from hallway. We didn't find it overly bothersome. 2. Beach: hurricane did damages, but of all the resorts nearby, RPRM probably has the best manmade beach, and useable natural beach with sandbag blocking the waves. It's the best in the area. 3. Water activities: 5 out of 7 days there were no sailing or any water activities due to wave conditions. Bummer. The good: 1. Service: it's the best of all the RIU we visited, including Riu Palace Mexico and Las Americas. Victor at Sports Bar, Miguel at the Buffet, and shaggy haired Carlos kept our stay very pleasant and interesting. PS: Victor is the guy to ask about all the best clubs and bars in Playacar, and he can get preferrential treatments for RPRM guests. 2. Room and resort condition: room was junior suite, so it's large and very nicely decorated. Resort was kept in top shape (seemed nicer than Royal Hideaway). 3. Location: very close to the town, and many ppl walk to 5th ave. We had a rental car, so it's extremely easy. Best of all with RPRM is the ability to exchange to different Riu properties. This allowed us to experience different restaurants and beaches. We had a day in Cancun, and enjoyed visiting and dining at Riu Palace Las Americas. Evening entertainment was surprisingly good, especially Maya Night. Other nights were entertaining enough that we didn't bother going out.

The grounds and facilities are very well kept and we found the staff to be very helpful and attentive to our needs. The lunch and dinner buffets at Don Manolo restaurant changed daily, and the breakfast buffet offered every choice imaginable each day. (Isabel at the omelette station makes great omelettes). Making reservations for the a la carte restaurants was not difficult (thanks Dania) and the food in each was very good. We didn't try the Japanese restaurant so can't comment on that one, though. Our room was a garden view on the back side of the resort facing the Wyndham next door but it was perfectly fine with us. As with any beach vacation, you aren't in the room that much anyways. Bed was a little hard but after a long day on the beach and walking to other resorts or Fifth Avenue, the bed felt great. Staff was very friendly and appreciative of our efforts to speak a little Spanish. We ended up having a lot of fun with some of the staff (Gregorio and Edgar, hosts at the restaurants; Miguel, a server at Don Manolo; Dania in reservations; Alex, head bellman who ran everything out front; Isabel at the omelette station, to name a few.) Turn-down service in the evening was a nice touch. We had a couples massage at the spa and it was terrific. There are also 2 jacuzzis on the back side of the spa that are available to everyone, not just spa customers, but we didn't know that until late in our stay. There is a very nice beach at the Riu Lupita beach area next door to the Palace, and during our stay the Palace was working on rebuilding the beach directly in front of the resort and was making good progress. So either way, access to the water is not a problem at all, as some have said. And if you just want to sun yourself on the beach, the Palace has a very large area for this. In fact, it was much nicer than the beaches at the other Rius we visited nearby. All in all, it was a great getaway.

Service- Excellent, not a single complaint! Though most of those working at the resort work six days a week and long hours everyone had a smile on their face and went out of their way to offer an 'hola' (hello). We found the staff very appreciative of tips, one waiter who had served us nearly every morning and evening was rewarded with a modest tip at the end of the trip and was truly grateful (as opposed to expecting . . .) Beach- Yes, access to beach is limited, but not nearly to the extent I expected. I would estimate that nearly 50% of the property has access to beach, though one does need to walk around a seawall. There are loads of lounge chairs and we never seen more than 60% of them in use and in most cases you would never know the beach did not go directly to water in front of you. Personally, I think to much has been made of the beach issue; their is no problem accessing the ocean and the ocean views are beautiful from almost all lounge chairs. BESIDES, only a small amount even ventured into the water, most just lounged on beach or stayed poolside. Food- Good, no complaints. As others have noted it does start to get tiring after a few days but we always found something we enjoyed and food was fresh. Tours- We went to Chitzen Itza and highly recommend this trip. Yes, it's a long drive but between the guide talking most of the way out and movie on the way back the time went by quickly. Also went to Xcaret after much deliberation between it and Xel-Ha. We enjoyed Xcaret and will try Xel-Ha on next visit.

My husband and I brought our 3 children, ages 5, 3 and 18 mos. The two things I would warn anyone who is considering this resort about are: The food and the sleeping arrangements. The Food: It seemed that because the food was all cooked by Mexicans it should have been only Mexican food. They \"tried\" to cook American food and it was VERY disappointing. The only reason we ate was because we were hungry. We have experienced Couples Sans Souci resort in Jamaica and Riu's food was like eating at a Luby's compared to Couples (which was excellent...gormet, and very flavorful). I also had stomach problems by the end of the trip which I'm sure can be blamed on ALL the buffets. Even when going to a \"sit down\" restaurant in the evenings where you would expect to be served, you are only served the main course. You must go through a salad/soup bar and desert bar. Children are welcome at this resort, but getting them fed was far to much work. Sleeping: The buildings are designed in such a way that any noise in the hallway echoes (all tile floors) and goes directly into the rooms. Although the hotel information clearly states that guests should be quiet after 11 in the hallways, everyone was so drunk that no one followed this guideline. The staff obviously could care less and did not inforce this. I got about 3 or 4 hours of sleep each night. Another point of concern was the language barrier. Very few of the employees spoke English. When traveling to a resort where so many Americans visit, we would have expected to be able to communicate our needs without having to use sign-language. This is definitey NOT a child/family friendly resort. If you are going to party all night and sleep it off all day, then this is the place for you.

Read all the reviews and decided to give it a go. Overall, I would rate this hotel a 3.5 to 4 star. Reasons are below. Without re-hashing all the other reviews, here is the straight goods (as we experienced it): PROS: Staff - Excellent and attentive. (one exception - late one night we tried to call the front desk to complain about a lot of noise from a bunch of drunken yahoo's down the hall but no one was there to answer the phone. I had to walk to the front desk to get someone to address the issue) Rooms - large and clean (Tv didn't work but who cares). Some mustiness but a few quick sprays with Febreeze cured the problem. So much moisture it is impossible to keep it fresh smelling. I took advantage of the in-room liquor dispenser!! Food - first rate overall with a great selection at the buffet and the A La Carte restaurants are also very good. Building - impressive architecture, well appointed with great pools and amenities. Spa and sauna nice, pools were clean and well attended, grounds were excellent except beach was not always kept clean. CONS: Very Noisy as little insulation between rooms and the hallway. The doors had no closers and slamming of the doors could be heard loud and clear up to 12:30 AM and starting again around 6 AM. People leaving early for the airport could be heard dragging (Klack Klack Klack) over the tiles. Bring earplugs and you will be OK otherwise prepare to be awoken many times during your rest. Towels and bed linens were worn and no better than in a 2-3 star resort. Often the towels were not properly washed and several times we had to ask for clean towels as the ones provided were smeared with stuff which had not washed off (like lipstick, eye-shadow, god knows what else) Beds: They are hard as compared to other hotels but we did not mind as we are used to hard beds. We asked for clean bed linens one day as we spilled something on the bed. I discovered two days later they just turned the sheets around and put the stain at the foot of the bed. So, we slept in the same sheets for 6 nights. Entertainment - Well, sort of a hit and miss. Hard for me to comment here as some people seemed to enjoy the silly shows while others were very bored and left early. Some of the local talent brought in seemed to be very good. I guess if you go there for the entertainment, don't expect Las Vegas as many of the shows are put off by the local hotel staff and are not much above a high school production. Beach: Although the actual beach was eroded and you really could not swim in the sea, we didn't mind as there was a man-made beach at the end of the hotel which was fine. I did notice that the beach area was often littered with cig butts and empty glasses. Overall, I would probably return if I got the deal I just did but I would not recommend paying full price for this hotel based on their rating of 5.5 stars as it is a 3.5 to 4 star at best. However, in comparison to other hotels in the area (which rate themselves as a 4-5 star hotel), I suspect it is one of the better ones. We met several people who had stayed at other 5 star resorts and complained about the food, the service and the amenities. Last but not least, the local attractions: Xcaret is a great all day event and gives you a quick taste of everything local plus a great evening show highlighting local talent and costumes (very professional and entertaining). Several of the Mayan ruins are worth seeing and we choose Chichen Itza. A long day as it is a 3 hour bus ride to and fro plus several hours on site. We really enjoyed the guided tour and would recommend this to anyone interested in history. Shopping is OK in Playa Del Carmen but beware the street vendors as they will start very high in price and can usually be reduced by 50 - 80 percent. Also, once in the store they will become a real pest if you choose not to buy and in some cases resorted to name calling when we walked out of the store. Not in the mood to haggle, there are several decent malls with moderate priced goods for sale but anything with a price tag on it is usually not up for negotiation.", "Date": "November 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lynchburg, VA", "Title": "\u201cBest Vacation Imaginable\u201d", "Author": "kdmcgann", "ReviewID": "UR10945562", "Content": "After reading reviews like a crazed maniac for the months, weeks and days leading up to our trip, I thought I would write about everything that no one else mentioned. Well the fact of the matter is, it's just not possible. This place is absolutely perfect. I will try just to hit on the highlights of our trip. There is a bit of a musty smell in the room and the hotel in general, however, you are in the tropics. And when I got home I didn't have to wash my clothes over and over. One round of Downey did the trick for me!! We didn't even really notice it after about 5 minutes of being there. The biggest advice I can offer is to make sure you get an egg crate from the front desk for the bed. It is quite hard. They were actually out of egg crates when we arrived, but put numerous blankets on the bed to soften it up and it did the trick. The food overall was pretty good. We had no problem whatsoever making reservations. The \"table\" is the busiest right at 12:00 when they open it up. We ate at the Mexican place, Steakhouse and Japanese. I really didn't think anything was Mexican about the Mexican place other than the salad bar. My husband and I liked the Mexican the least. The steakhouse was awesome. If you want a good ole Ribeye, this is the place for you. It was very tasty and tender. Japanese was pretty good. It was my first sushi experience. We found the buffet at breakfast, lunch and dinner to be great. Sportsbar food was nice to have around too. My biggest advice regarding food is to try new things. I ate things that I thought I would hate, but loved. Dress code: I didn't see that it was that strictly enforced, but no shorts for guys at specialty restaurants, but at the buffet for dinner, anything goes. The pool is great. The entertainment staff is like none other around the pool. We had a great guy doing water aerobics one day! All of these people seem like they just love their job. Pedro is the nicest poolside server ever!!! I've seen a lot of posts about the beach. It's true, there isn't that much sand right at the beach, but it's still fairly decent access and we still enjoyed the ocean! I can't say enough about the staff at this resort. Everyone greets you whenever you pass and just genuinely seem happy to be there. My biggest complaint about the hotel was that the rooms are not very soundproof. We woke up one night to someone's clock alarm going off and when the maid or bellhops go by with rollers on the tile, it's a bit loud. However, I will be the first to say that this was not a huge damper on the trip in the least bit.

We have been to Cancun 9 times but this was our first time in Playa Del Carmen so we were not sure what to expect. The trip from the airport took almost two hours because of having to drop off other vacationers but we did get to see a lot. We have stayed at all three Riu's in Cancun so we thought we knew what to expect. The check-in went fast & we were given our room cards as soon as we got there. We were put in a garden view room & were not very happy with it. We could not see the ocean or the pool. We looked directly at the hotel next door and as for the \"garden view\" it was not very good. A couple of trees but no flowers. We went back to the front desk & asked for a jacuzzi suite & we were told that we could be upgraded on Sat. so we only had to stay in the garden view for a couple of days. When we moved to the jacuzzi suite it was like a totally different hotel!! The room was amazing! It had a living/sitting room, a walk-in closet, a huge balcony with a great view. The jacuzzi was in between the bedroom & the bathroom & was open. It was well worth the upgrade. There were a few ants but it was no big deal. As for the food we thought it was very good. We ate at the Japanese restaurant one night & the steakhouse another. They were both good. It was not hard to get reservations, we had to be in the lobby bar between 12:00 - 3:00 which was better than having to get there at 7:00 in the morning like we had to do at the ones in Cancun. The buffet was very good with a lot of different choices. The Riu has room service from 7:00 AM - 11:00 PM which I think they should change to 24 hour room service like most of the other hotels offer. The beach was not all that great but we were in Mexico so we could live with it. We did prefer to stay at the beach instead of the pool though. We loved going down to 5th Ave. It was so different than Cancun. People are more laidback & don't hassle you as much when you are shopping. We went to the Blue Parrot Beach Club & had a blast. The Firedancers were great. There is a ton of stuff to do downtown but we ran out of time. Cancun has always been our favorite but we think we have found a new place to love.

We went here just after it opened last year, and found the place had changed. Room. The mini bar refrigerator broke down the first night and leaked water all over the floor. This was repaired when reported to the front desk. The water pressure in room 2096 was very weak in the shower. We asked if we could be moved to a room that had better water pressure and we were told to ask again the next day. This was for a hotel that was in low season and had plenty of rooms. The next day we again complained that the pressure was low and were told that it would be reported to maintainence. This problem was never resolved after speaking politely to 3 front desk staff. The toilets do not flush very good. You have to hold the flush lever down for a long time to empty the bowl of even liquid waste, other material is even more mechanically challenging! Food. Not as good as last year. The quality of the breakfast and lunch buffet at the pool was the same as last year. The lunch and dinner at the main buffet restaurant was lower in quality and selection with few if any seafood offerings. Mussels and pan-grilled whitefish or salmon at the main buffet. The rodizio was good, but not great. The japanese \"Yashima\" was the best with an outstanding salmon entree. They even had cold sake. The pool was COLD! REALLY COLD! Sadly, the erosion from the surf has virtually destroyed the beach at this hotel, and the surrounding properties as well. You may well have to go north or south of the Playacar area to find even a fairly nice beach. This is not the fault of the hotel, but if the hotels in this area do not make a concerted effort to restore the beach they will eventually lose out to other hotels that have beachfront. I did go out of my way to be nice to the staff at this hotel, but I was put off by the lack of hospitality by the front desk staff and the bartenders at the pool. My encounters with the housekeeping staff were the most positive, and our room was kept immaculate.

The pool was enormous! It could have been a bit cleaner, but not bad. And they always had fun activities around the pool and music. Very fun activity crew - and not too annoying. Downside - they only give you one towel - and it is not a typical beach towel size. And there were plenty of chairs - you don't need to go down at 6:00am to get a spot - eventhough some did to get the poolside chairs. The rooms were very nice - the bed was not too hard in my opinion. Most people complained about that in the reviews. I thought it was fine. The resort itself was very nice and quite clean. The food was okay. But for the price, I cannot complain! Breakfast was the best. The only restaurant that served lunch was the buffet by the pool - and it was pretty much the same every day. And the dinner buffet was actually my favorite. I did not like the restaurants much. The Brazilian one was awful. The steakhouse was the best. I am spoiled living in Ohio with the no smoking in restaurants and bars - smoking was everywhere there - just like anywhere outside the US for the most part, so that was a bit annoying, but I expected it. I only left the resort once - to walk to Playa del Carmen. I was very impressed on the walk there. Very nice homes, condos, resorts and very clean. And Playa del Carmen impressed me. It was much larger than I thought. The only thing I was sad about was the lack of fine jewelry stores. And just as I read, all the drinks by the pool are in very small plastic cups. But they will fill a large cup if you bring it - no glass. And the only beer they have is Corona - nothing else. The staff was very nice. The Funjet representatives were not very nice - long story.

My husband & I stayed from Oct. 20th-26th to celebrate our first anniversary. The front desk staff were very friendly & accomodating...we were offered an upgrade from a garden view room to a superior courtyard room for $25 a night. We accepted it, and even though it was only 10am, we were given our room keys and were ready to enjoy the resort well before regular check-in time! I assume we were able to do this because October is still off-peak, rainy season and normally the resort isn't at full capacity. We arrived in our room to find that our mini-fridge only had one Corona and a few Pepsi's ... so I called down to the front desk, and within 3 minutes we had a fully restocked fridge! Even throughout the week, if we ever ran out of anything in the room (more Coronas, towels, etc.) all it took was a quick call down to the front desk and within 5 minutes, we had whatever we needed!! The staff - no matter if they were part of the housekeeping crew, landscape workers, pool servers, restaurant waiters - were all so friendly and you never passed by someone without seeing a smile on their face and a friendly \"hola!\" I will agree with previous reviews that the rooms do have a musty odor when you first walk into them ... but we didn't have any issues after the first minute or so that you enter the room - we got used to it without any problems. By the way, if you're worried about the beds being too hard, just call down to the front desk and request a foam cover for the mattress and it will help to make the bed more comfortable. We ate at the Brazilian & Steakhouse restaurants and we enjoyed both ... the Japanese restaurant was good too, but our favorite place to eat was at the buffet (I was surprised at the variety of tasty food choices they had!) and each night had a different theme at the buffet. Don't think that since it's a buffet, that the staff skimps on their service ... the waiters are always pulling out chairs for the female guests, refilling empty water & drink glasses before they are even close to empty - the service was fantastic! My husband & I went parasailing right from the ScubaCaribe station located on the beach at the resort ... very fun even though I'm afraid of heights!! :) We also booked an excursion through our Apple Vacations Rep - we did the Mayan Adventure Snorkeling trip ... it was a good excursion, although it makes for a long day because we were picked up at the hotel at 8am and didn't return back until 4:30pm ... alot of that time is spent in the van going between the 3 locations that you snorkel at, as well as dropping off other guests at other resorts on the way back. But, all in all, it was still a good time. The walk into the town of Playa Del Carmen only takes about 15 minutes, and it's a very safe walk because the resort is located within a community that has gated, guarded entrances. There are plenty of things to see and do in the town of Playa Del Carmen if you like to shop, go to some bars (Senor Frogs, Carlos & Charlies) and do some tequila taste-testing!! You can also catch a ferry to Cozumel - we didn't go, but I think it's about $7 each way per person to take the ferry. One morning we took a walk down to the other Riu properties and walked through the Riu Palace Mexico, Riu Yucatan & Riu Playacar ... although I didn't see anything wrong with those resorts, I'm just so glad that we choose the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. It's nice to know that the other resorts are there if you want to visit their pools or beaches, but just remember that you can't use your beach towel card at the other resorts ... bring your towels with you if you're visiting the other properties.

Only complaint in this area is that the shows were \"same old, same old\" for people who have previously stayed in Riu resorts in Playa Del Carmen.

The corridors late at night echoed with the sound of them returning to their rooms, calling out to each other and generally making a din.

I was a little fearful of the forecast because all the internet showed was rain. Fortunately it rained sporadically the first 2 days but not enough to run you into your room. It mainly clouded up in late afternoon & showered a little almost everynight but it didn't ruin a thing. I had read a lot of reviews prior to visiting this Riu & yes the rooms tend to be moldy smelling-probably a lot to do with the humudity. I took a recommendation of bringing a candle & Febreeze & it did the trick. You ignored it after a couple of days until you get your belongings home & they all need to be washed & aired out!! We did have to change rooms the first day. We were given a smoking room when we requested a non-smoking room and also it was 2 double beds pushed together not a king. They were very nice accomadating our request & were moved quickly. This is definitely a hotel for those wanting to relax with no kids & no partying @ night. I would say 35+ age group. Everyone is very nice there & remember you day to day. Daytime is great. Relax by the pool or on the beach & have drinks served to you all day long. Great pool bar! Oh & nacho bar for the munchies! There basically is 2 beach areas. One above the water behind a retaining wall with plenty of chairs & hammocks. Down @ the beach is ok. A lot has been eroded by the hurricanes but they are trying to pump sand up on the beach to rebuild & there is a lot of sand bags out to minimize the breaking of the waves & more erosion. This is not the only resort suffering from this, it has happened all along the coast line. It is not as rocky as others have claimed. The buffet was great all day. The only restuarants we tryed was the Mexican & Steak House. Mexican was good! The shows were every night @ 9:40pm. They were just ok. Michael Jackson show & Crazy Night were the best. Nightlife dies @ 10:45 unless you just want to relax by the bar or play pool in the sports bar. We're young & were ready for bed by 11:00 after doing excursions & being in the sun all day! We did go to the disco @ Riu Tequila one night. It doesn't open until 11:00. It was very small & crowded & the drinks weren't all that great! If you go to this area of Mexico to find a deal shopping it isn't here. There is the Plaza 5 min. from the resort but they don't barter much. Oh & if you need anything for the weather (bathing suit, shorts, flip flops, sunscreen) your going to pay for it!! Sunscreen is $15-$20 there unlike our $4-$8 price in the states. We checked many locations & it was the same everywhere. 5th Ave. shopping was a joke! $5 cab ride to an outdoor mall that is outrageous & not real friendly people. Just on the outskirts is bartering shopping but you really have to stand ground to them. They can be very pushy & rude & if you go to one vender all the ones down the road won't leave you alone. We also went about 5:30pm to the area & it didn't feel real secure/safe. Another thing I didn't find out until our last day is whatever a cab driver quotes you it includes their tip. Excursions to try: Tulum Extreme, Mayan Adventure, ATV excursion! Fun! Bring tip money for your driver/guide. Also, most excursions take photos of you to buy @ the end so if you want them then have an extra $20-25 dollars on hand in cash only! Don't waste your time on dinner cruise in Cancun!!

It was a special treat for a special Occasion and I spent 3 months in deciding where to stay. I read every review, every forum and every little detail. I want to share my honest opinion. After reading all these posts, I was expecting something very extraordinary. That does not exist. I did have a good time, but it was not a unique, one of a kind experience to be catered to and lavished in luxury that I expected. RPRM was a beautiful property. I give the the front desk staff and housekeeping an average rating, the F&B attendants and food preparation 5 stars! I tipped and tipped and tipped, but the service and lack of service from the front desk and housekeeping is not there. This, however, did not ruin my trip. Just that everyone notes on these posts about the welcome drink, towel art, special upgrades, special surprise cakes if it is your birthday,etc etc etc. and I am telling you, this was just not happening. The rooms were sterile feeling and I determined the cause of this to be the marble floors, no softgoods and very unattractive beds. The beds were hard but they did not affect my sleep because I slept good, as I was tired. They are just not the nice, fluffy mattresses that we are use to in the USA. The bed coverings were old and hard and should have also been a nice fluffy alternative. It just wasn't very attractive and pleasing to the eye. The softgoods in the room were just non exsistant. I saw one post where someone complained about falling and twisting her ankle. It rained on us in the evenings and when it rains, the outside corridors are slicker than ice. They do put signs up and try to mop it up, but hey, it's marble. The Pool scene was nice. Lot's of action in the pool, especially the volleyball games. Did the intro scuba in the pool, that was fun, but only lasts about 20 minutes. I wish I had time for the pay dive service that takes you out in the ocean, but you make sure you have at least 24 hours before you are to depart property because of the oxygen(I suppose). I waited until the last day of stay which would have put me less than 24 hours, so this wasnt an option. Tried the snorkeling but they were suctioning sand off the ocean floor to use in thier sandbags, so the water was extremely cloudy. We tried to use the beach at one of the other RIU's (Yucatan) only to be told by the towel attendant that she could not give us towels even though we showed her our towel card. She said we had to use the towel service at our RIU. I knew this was wrong and just a \"lazy\" employee, but what do you do...we all have them! The entertainment was good. At least is was something to do. I did not use the Spa. I thought they had advertised a steam room, but when I got there, they did not have a steam, only sauna. I thought the Buffet to be above average. There is something for everyone. I am a dessert eater and the dessert was the same everyday/night and not that great. I did not feel like the variety was different each day at the buffets, however, that did not keep me away..it was still good! The buffet is your only option for breakfast and lunch. I was not aware of this until arrival and don't remember anyone posting about this. THere was no high speed internet that you could use with your laptop in the room. You had to pay $8 for 44 minutes in the bar area. It took the computer 5 minutes to load and get online with my email, so I ended up spending about $24 on internet usage. The phone service is non existant, unless you want to pay $4 to dial an 800 number. We bought cards($10 for 60 minutes) and would have to go down to the shopping center to use them. I did rent a car. If you plan to do this, don't do it at the airport. I think it is cheaper from your hotel or snag one of those books from the girl as you are exiting from the airport, it has coupons in it. I rented from AVIS and paid $40 per day. The car is only $15 but the insurance is $35. The driving was very easy and I don't read spanish. The RPRM is very convenient to park and retrieve the car. At the end of the stay, I cannot say that I had a lousy time because of the RPRM and thier lack of inconsistencies. The F&B attentants work very hard and are so pleasant. Should I return, I would probably chose another location, but I was not uncomfortable at the RIU.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "st. louis", "Title": "\u201cRPRM was wonderful!\u201d", "Author": "gina33", "ReviewID": "UR10254956", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the RPRM from Oct. 6th - Oct. 13. Our stay was wonderful, and I would agree with most of the 5 star reviews on this board. Check in - completely smooth. I had emailed the hotel a week prior to arrival to request a certain room. When we arrived, that particular room was not available, so they gave us an upgrade to a better room. (For free) Room: Absolutely wonderful. Very clean, nice and cool. Balcony was wonderful. We had a fabulous ocean view, and I spent a lot of time on the balcony just relaxing and having drinks. Always had extra towels and nightly turndown service. Staff: The staff exceded our expectations with thier generous personalities and eagerness to make our stay wonderful. The entertainment staff, bartenders, and front desk staff all spoke English, so there was no problem with language barriers. Our favorite bartender was Antonio at the swim up bar. He made rainy days so much fun. Pool: The pool is huge. Much bigger than those of the other RIU properties in Playacar. We enjoyed the infinity pool, as well as the swim up bar. There were plenty of loungers. No towel games were necessary at the pool, or the beach. Beach: Nice upper level beach with palm trees/loungers. Lower level beach was no doing great due to erosion, but you were still able to walk a little ways, and get in to swim. And NO, the beach is no rocky as others have indicated. I brought water shoes thinking I would need to wear them to swim after reading reviews here, but didn't need to use them at all. You were not able to walk very far to the left. Only to the next resort. To the right, you could walk down 3 resorts or so, but not all the way to the other Palace resort. We walked the road one day to go to the other Palace, and their beach was in much better condition. Dining: The food was great. The buffets had a million choices, and I had something different each morning. Lunch at the buffet was delicious as well. As far as specialty restaurants, my favorite was the steakhouse. The gourmet was also good. The Brazilian was good, but omigod! I have never eaten that much meat at one time! The Japanese was okay. We didn't eat at the Mexican restaurant. Nightlife: As some reviews on this board suggest: the hotel is very quiet past 10 or 11. They do have shows in the theatre each night at around 9:30. The other end of the resort closer to the ocean is pretty much like a graveyard at this time of the night. Very dark, and nothing going on. This didn't bother us at all. We were there to relax, and we had a lot of cocktails during the day, so we were ready for bed by 11:00 or so anyway. The lobby bar was fun. Also, the sports bar is open 24/7. So you could go in there to drink, play games, eat snacks at any time of the day. Playa nightlife: If you are looking to party, it is definitely worth it to take a cab into playa for $5.00. You can walk, but it takes about 25 minutes. There is a ton of shopping, cute bars, live music at some of them, and various dance clubs. We went to Playa one night and had a blast. Summary: This hotel is beautiful, and definitely worth the cost. It lives up to it's 5 star rating and reviews. Although the Palace Mexico has a better beach, this is a much nicer hotel. You can walk 4 minutes down the road and go to the other beach for the day if you need to. We didn't even find that necessary. The beach was fine in my opinion. If you stay here, you won't regret it.

We were so pleased with our holiday. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, our stay at this hotel was nothing short of PHENOMENAL! The staff was absolutely wonderful. The employees were so accomodating and polite. They were helpful and did not mind going the extra mile when we needed something. For example, we had a problem with our room door about four days into the vacation. The key pad did not work. . We called the front desk and within minutes the maintenance man showed up and fixed our problem. I have never seen such fast service. My boyfriend and I were shocked. We have stayed at many hotels and have never seen such a responsive staff. At breakfast, lunch and dinner the staff was extremely attentive. My favorite was Rene at breakfast. He made sure that our water glass did not go half empty. He always brought the coffee and milk out for us with a smile. After our second day at the resort, we didn't even have to ask him for the coffee and milk, he just brought it to our table when he saw us approaching. He was wonderful and so was the rest of the staff at the restaurants. We made reservations for dinner at Agave, Sir Oliver, and the Japanese restaraunt. The food was good- my favorite was the Japanese. The service was even better. The staff at the restaurants treated us better than we have been treated in some five star restaurants in Fort Lauderdale. We left tips for the staff because they work so hard. They take your order, bring you your food, clean up the dirty dishes, and do pretty much anything a normal server does at a restaurant. I would recommend bringing some tip money. The staff works really hard and they seem to appreciate it when you give them a little extra boost for their hard work. Not only is the staff great, but the hotel and the accomodations are beautiful. The Riu did not miss a detail with this resort. Inside it has a European and Spanish Flair. It is very elegant and has a grand entrance. It is quite impressive when you first arrive at the hotel. The rooms were nice, but a little on the small side. We booked a junior suite. The balcony had a gorgeous view, which made up for the small size of the room. We were very happy with the view. The property was gorgeous inside and out! The beach is lovely too. It has lush palm trees and plenty of lounge chairs for soaking up the sun. The beach itself is not a very big beach. There is a sea wall that blocks the sun bathing area from the actual beach. The reason the actual beach area is not big is due to the fact that the Yucatan has experienced many tropical storms. Unfortunately, I understand what happened to Playa Del Carmen all too well. I am from Fort Lauderdale, Florida and have been through enough storms to know that beach erosion is just a fact of life in the tropics. The water is so stunning and it makes up for the erosion. We enjoyed the beach and our holiday. We will definitely go to another RIU property and I highly recommned this resort. I was concerned because I read some bad reviews on this resort. I don't agree with any of those reviews. When you read all of these reviews you have to be objective and take the good with the bad and go see for yourself. Once you go, you will know what I am writing about! It's a great place. And by the way, don't miss the Michael Jackson show. It was the best nightly show at the resort.

Only negative experience I can say was that we were given a room that was already occupied, so than we were quickly given one on an upper level. After unpacking I noticed a mildew smell in the sheets, so I contacted my representative and housekeeping changed the sheets on the bed immediately which made a big difference. I bought a candle to help keep the room smelling good too. You might want to travel with an air freshner in case this happens to you. I wish I had asked for egg crates for the bed- I just read a review about that. The bed was a little hard, but OK. Other than that I had a fabulous time and excellent service and wonderful food.

Buffet was good during the weekdays. Housekeeping cleaned room adequately. Adult activities (water volleyball, soccer, bingo) were fun. Ocean colors were beautiful. Cons: Hotel rooms are mediocore. Many areas of the hotel are not air conditioned (hallways, some restaurants). Hotel staff was either extremely nice or down right nasty. The front desk staff was not accommodating. Buffet was not as good on the weekend. Room service menu was extremely limited. Mini bar only had drinks. Pool water was extremely hot, so it was not refreshing. NOT a family resort. Kids program barely existed. Drunk people at the pool (needed to be escorted away from the pool due to the behaviors displayed). Several nude women on the beach and at the pool. Hotel arranged transfers to and from airport, but did not tell us the transfer was provided by a tour company \"hotel beds\" trying to gain our business. \"Hotel beds\" did not show up for our transfer back to the airport. The agent stated she called our room and someone said we did not need it. However, doorman arranged for a taxi and \"hotel beds\" paid the fare. Other guests stated things were stolen from their rooms (we were fortunate this did not happen to us). The beds were extremely hard and actually hurt our backs. One night, another guests alarm clock went off at 3am. We heard it all night until 8am. (Would have called the front desk if we weren't so tired.) Restaurant next to pool (CHILI'S) manager stated we could not eat because our bathing suits were wet. Meanwhile, almost everyone had wet bathing suits and he said nothing. Beach area was small and water was cloudy (did not see any fish). The hotel is only about 1 1/2 years old and looks very worn for the age. Overall, we will not return. This was not a five star hotel.

Pool was very nice, not superbly clean, but nice. The Pool bar was clean, and the bartenders were very efficient and nice. The beach, well, what beach pretty much eroded. In fact a lot of the beaches in playa were eroded. The ocean is still absolutely beautiful. The staff at the Riu--- bartenders were great, especially giving props to Islas and Victor they made the nightly entertainment. Oh, and to play pool/any game in the sports bar it was like 3.00, ridiculous, considering they didn't really have any nightlife. Front door staff, were very accomodating at first, but as the week progressed service kinda changed in general. In fact, one day our room went unclean and there was barely any wait staff by the pool. Pool service in the beginning was very good, Marvin/Islas were great, however service by the pool tapered very much soo by the end of the week, no liquor cart going around asking for drinks. Didn't like the fact that the pool closes at 7pm, and the towel bar closes even earlier. Didn't like that they wouldn't let us put our plastic tables in the pool to set our drinks on, guess they don't care about people spilling their drinks in the pool. I do agree, that the pool towels weren't the best. There's not much to do at night, cept the typical mexican shows, nothing sooo special. Night life definitely not for the late 20s crowd, we checked out the nightclub, it's okay but rather small and a 10minute walk from the hotel. Thank goodness we found some other fun couples to hang out with. I did take advantage of the spa, the massage was good, not great and not sure if it was worth 90.00 but we were on vacation. The pedicure was below average, but the girl who did it was very sweet, they don't even have the big chairs to sit in while they are doing it. A girl we met down there said she had the body wrap, and it was fabulous. The Spa in general as far as facilities goes, was prob. below average in my standards. The food- The breakfast buffet was good, pretty much the same everyday though. The lunch buffet was good the first day, but got very very routine after that. Dinner- The steakhouse-we walked out on after waiting 10 minutes to be greeted/and an hour for our food which the steak ended up being rare/when we ordered medium/well, wasn't taking any chances in mexico. The Gourment restraunt-beef was very very good (our favorite). The Japanese-no steakhouse, but was very good. The Mexican restaurant, average/not the greatest. Nightly dinner buffet, which we ate at 3 times was pretty good/very good. We did report the issue at the steakhouse and our room not being cleaned, the two young people behind the desk had no idea what to do about our complaints, in fact the one boy just walked away and let me continue c/o to the other girl. Oh, and the room, well that was great, very very well airconditioned and very spacious, bathtub/shower were great and our refrigerator was almost always stocked. Loved having Corona at the hotel. . I will say, though, my husband and I still managed to have a great time. And if you are a frequent traveler to Mexico, you know all of the resorts have their pros/cons. I would say, honestly, this resort's pros/cons are pretty much equal. But i would say 7 days is definitely enought time to spend at this resort, considering the lack of things to do.

We were scheduled to stay from August 15-22 but unfortunately we had to cut our trip short by two days due to the impending Hurricane Dean. That was one of the few dissapointing parts about our trip. I have to admit I was a little nervous about staying here after reading some of the reviews posted. Now I wonder if I stayed at the same hotel as some of the people who posted negative reviews. We booked our trip through a travel agent and arrived at Cancun Airport and were transported by van by Olympus Tours. Everything went great as they brought us to the hotel without a hitch. When we pulled up to the place I was impressed as we drove in to the driveway. That was just the beginning. As you walk in to the lobby you can't help but be impressed with how beautiful this hotel is. They certainly did not spare any expense in the construction of this place. It is just very appealing. When we checked in we were pleasantly surprised to find out our room was an ocean view room. We had upgraded to a mini suite so maybe that was part of the reason we had an ocean view. The room was beautiful with a very large bed and a sunken living room area. The patio looked out to the gorgeous grounds and the ocean. I had read so many reviews about an awful odor in the rooms. I have to say that I did not notice anything at all in regards to an odor. Yes the bed was a little hard but nothing that bothered us that much. Each morning we would order a pot of coffee from room service after I returned from a nice walk. One thing that I liked about the area that the hotel is in is that it is very safe to walk around.The street that the hotel is located on is gated. I would go out each morning for my walk and felt very safe. There are several other hotels and villas nearby and plenty of people out and about. Because our stay only lasted 5 days instead of 7 we were not able to try all the restaurants but the ones we did try were very good. Because we arrived around 4 p.m. we tried the buffet dining room on the first night. They have a different \"theme\" each night. We went on Mexican and Italian night. The food was excellent.There is a great variety of items at the buffet that were deliscious. We also ate at the Steak House, The Brazilian and The Mexican restaurants. All were very good. One thing that I must also say about the waitstaff at the restaurants is that they can't be nicer and more accomodating. They are so friendly. On our last night we had a new waiter at the Mexican restaurant named William who was very nice. He told us how he was going to school to learn the English language better. That is one area where I could see room for improvement. Some of the help could speak better English in order to communicate with the guests. This was a bit of a problem at the pool or the breakfast buffet but not at the dinner restaurants. I realize we are in their country. It was just a minor inconvenience- no big deal. We took a cab in to Playa Del Carmen one night. What a busy area that is. Lots of bars and restaurants. I would recommend it if you are looking to do something different. We also took a trip to The Mayan Ruins one day and it was interesting but HOT. Of course it is August! One thing that we enjoyed was having a few drinks at the bar in the main lobby either before or after dinner. Now that I think of it, some nights we had a few before and after dinner! Oh what the hell, we're on vacation. We had two great bartenders.The first night we had Pimintel and he was very nice.The rest of the time we had Islas. He is quite a character.Very entertaining. We had some fun with him. The only dissapointing things were when we were leaving we had asked for a wake up call that never came. Thankfully we set an alarm. Also when we were leaving because our flight was early we had to carry our own bags down because there are no bellhops available at 6 a.m. I thought that was not good for a hotel of this caliber. One last thing I would like to mention is booking through a travel agent. Ours was very instrumental in helping to get us a flight out of Mexico. When we decided not to risk staying through the hurricane, I contacted him and at that time he could not find any available flights. We also checked ourselves and had no luck. The next morning our travel agent called me back at told us of a flight on JetBlue and we booked it. I know that these days many people book on the internet and save money but I'm not sure I would have been able to get that flight without my travel agent's help.

We were warned by others that this place would ruin us, as you experience the best of the best every single day. Fun: Nightly themed shows, Pool acitivites, Volleyball, Pool, Vendors, etc etc. This resort always shows you something different each night for you to experience. Cleanliness: they wash the resort top to bottom every day. Very impressed! Pool is clean and always checked daily. Service: Full service all the time everday. All inclusive is obviously the way to go. You don't even have to get up to get your own beers.. there are staff at every bar that wait on you hand and foot. Very friendly and personable (you learned their names versus just viewing them as a bartender) even with Hurricane Dean rolling in. Food: Onsite restaurants are amazing! Even the buffet thats available every nite (the other restaurnts require reservations) is great food with different themed nights. Steakhouses are top notch (try the iguana meat = superb!). Gourmet and fresh fish, seafood and meat... can't complain about it at all. Nachos/sandwhiches and snacks available 24/7 in the Sports bar. Free room service (try the Chicken Toasties!) Ate everything without any stomach problems -- water is always bottled and ice in the blended drinks didn't seem to bother anyone's stomach. Beach/Pool - Beach is awesome!! Don't worry about any sort of erosion, cause it's not there. The only time we saw sandbags by the seawall was when hurricane Dean was on its way in. Stunning beach with lush palm trees. A real treat to the eyes and senses.. tho bring lots of sunblock! Pool is absolutely huge and always clean. Swim up bar is always busy and staff seem to keep up with the traffic just fine. If you stay here, you will be ruined on other resorts. We stopped by the Riu Tequila (part of 6 hotels in the vicinity that you get access to) and it's much busier over there with no 'full service' (you have to get your own beers ! :P Recommend you walk to the plaza (5 mins away) for some good souvenirs, and go to Playa Del Carmen for some more bartering style shopping (very safe, don't worry). Also recommend Xel-ha/Tulum trip.. you will have the time of your life!!! Trust me! P.S. - I was there when the 'Americans' were there too. They weren't a bother as some have reviewed. Some families are there as well, so there are some kids in the pool later on in the afternoon, but the resort is so big that you will not notice (we didn't and we were on our honeymoon).", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel...Shame about the Americans!\u201d", "Author": "nickifoxy", "ReviewID": "UR8447275", "Content": "Well what a lovely hotel this is!

We took our sons, ages 25 and 21, for a little family rendezvous. Day one we lounged by the pool, Day two we went on snorkeling adventure to Puerto Morelos (Dive Puerto Morelos, ask for Sylvia, $25 US/person) had lunch at her recommendation - AWESOME, took a cab back to the Riu for $25 (great bargain!) and then lounged by the pool, Day Three - you guessed it, lounged by the pool and the beach. The water scenery is breathtaking. The best water we have seen. (we travel a lot! Hawaii, Virgin Islands, etc.) Learned how to play Euchre in the Bar Lounge one afternoon, water volleyball and even water aerobics. FUN! Lots of European influence. Not crowded at all. Don't drink the water in your hotel room. Plenty of bottled water provided for you in your inroom refrigerator. Japanese restaurant VERY GOOD, Gourmet Sir Oliver, again very good, especially the ambiance. VERY attentive service in both locations. Buffets for dinner were good, not great. However, No one in this family starved, let me tell you! Breakfast was the best! Must haves: Mango yogurt and the Banana Juice! AWESOME! The city of Playa del Carmen was charming. \"Fifth Avenue\" was very friendly. Deals??? Who can really say! But definitely fun to experience! A $5 cab ride from the hotel. We would have walked it but it was HOT and VERY HUMID the whole time we were there. It was AUGUST remember. We have decided that maybe staying at a hotel that would provide breakfast only would be the way to go. Then we could experience more of what the town had to offer in terms of fine dining. There were plenty of restaurants that I would have liked to try but after paying the all inclusive rate, didn't want to spend more on the outside. Drinks - certainly watered down. But still fun to try all of their different concoctions!!! You could certainly be busier than we were - we went there to be together and enjoy the beauty. I must add that we booked with VACATION EXPRESS now for the second year in a row. This company will get our business again in the future as well. NOT A SINGLE FLAW! Use them with confidence!

I had planned ahead and packed a bag so we can start to enjoy our stay. We were given our bracelets and immediately were told to go to eat, drink and use the pool. Promptly at 3:00 all 3 of our rooms were ready. One of the rooms had a king bed for the two teenage boys. Within minutes they changed there room, no problems! The rooms are spacious with lots of granite and dark woods. Very sheek. During our stay we enjoyed all the activities, food, resturants, drinks, and shows. Water sports, sand sports and the ocean were all within expectations. The shows were pretty good for resort style shows. One night we wanted to go down to the ocean and enjoy a bottle of champagne. Not a problems, within 10 minutes we had a fruit platter, champagne and 2 chlled glasses sent to our room! The pool and pool bar I think were our favorite. The drinks were excellent (the fruit de something was terrific). Not waterered down at all. The mix of people was enjoyable as well, meeting alot of fun sociable people. Not too many young children. I have traveled 3 times a year for the past 10 years, mostly to resorts and Caribean Islands. I must say this resort was a first class operation. The food was terrific (no episodes with the fruits, water or ice out of a group of 6), the staff was pleasing and pleasant, the resort itself was gorgeous (pictures do not do justice) and overall a wonderful experience....I am already planning a long weekend return in two months!!!

The service was impeccable and delivered with a sincere smile . Location: is perfect-a 20 minute walk into Playa, or $5 cab ride. It was wonderful to be so close to town-we never felt isolated and had easy access to all the wonders of Playa town. The decor of the resort is spectaular-very opulent and beautiful. The rooms were beautiful and spacious for the 2 adults and 2 children. Maid service was great-room always cleaned by noon and a fresh set of towels and turndown service in the evenings. Food: wonderful. The sit down restaurants and buffets were delicious. We actually prefered the selection and quality at the buffets and the flexibilty of dining when we wanted. Alcohol: All top shelf brands served at all the bars. No no-name liquor here. Also, the mini fridge in the rooms had cold bottles of Corona-heaven after a long hard day at the beach. The pools and pool bars were wonderful.. The beach area is small, but the top tier of the beach is very large and has hundreds of palm trees providing shade. This area was just beautiful and the site for 5 weddings during our stay. Air Conditioning: Perfect! The entire resort has full a/c with the exception of Chili's - the outdoor restaurant. It was wonderful to escape the heat ( high 90s and very humid during our visit) and retreat to the coolness. ( We met up with a few couples during a day trip to Playa that were staying in other resorts that didn't have a/c in the public areas. Needless to say, this put a real damper on their experience).

We have an excellent trip. Airport to hotel transportation was booked through Lomas travel. We booked the private transfers so it was just the 2 of us and we went non-stop to the hotel. Definitely the way to go. Hotel check-in was smoooooth. I had requested in advance to have lowest floor closest to restaurants due to recent knee surgery. Our request was granted and we were in room 0152 in the main building, bottom floor. The room was awesome. A/C worked GREAT. The mini bar was full and re-stocked every day. We had a towel animal on the bed each and every day. The bathroom had a jetted tub and the blow dryer was the best hotel room blow drier I've every used. Bathroom also had a magnifying mirror for makeup and such. The room had an iron and ironing board and a safe (they give you the look and the key when you check in.)The only concern I would have is the 2 steps down to the sitting area. This could be dangerous for families with smaller children and I know of one guest who fell down them during our trip (in the dark). She was ok, but very badly bruised. We only ordered room service once. The menu was limited, as is typical, but adequate. We had our meal within 20 minutes and the waiter apopogized profusely for it taking so long! Upon arrival we made our reservations for the ala carte restaurants. Gentlemen, be aware...you need appropriate dress for these restaurants. Khaki slacks and a collar shirt are fine. Shorts and jeans are not acceptable. We ate one night at the steak house, one night at the Japenese. Both were excellent. Sushi at the buffet restaurant was excellent. I found the buffet to have a varied selection with more than enough to satisfy even the pickiest eater. Wait staff at all restaurants was exceptional. However, I could live without them pushing my chair in for me every time. There is 24 hour food and beverage service available in the Sports Bar. They have burgers and hotdogs that you can microwave, sandwiches and nachos and a full bar with bartender. Bar service EVERYWHERE at the resort was incredible. Several times we had to ask for LESS rum in the Pina Coladas. Watered down drinks are definitely not a problem here! Pool and beach chairs were plentiful, however you do need to stake out your pool chairs before breakfast to get the best selection. the pool was wonderful with a swim-up bar, separate infinity pool, sunloungers built into the pool and several fountains. The waitstaff at the pool was also incredible. There are activites going on around the pool during the day but we chose not to participate this time around. the beach has suffered due to the severe storm surge last December. The beach where they have the chairs and palms trees is still huge, but the swimming beach is fairly small. the only downside to the hotel is the lack of nightlife. After the show ends in the evening, there is nothing to do. You can go to the disco at the Riu Tequila, but we didn't feel like leaving the hotel. The Tequila is either a 15 minute walk or a $3 cab ride, so it's not too bad.

Our stay was for 5 nights. I booked the hotel thru an on-line airline/travel company. I requested that the two rooms be adjoining, with 1 room having a king size bed and the 2nd room having queen size beds. We arrived at the hotel a couple of hours earlier than the standard check-in. We were greeted with a tasty, cold grapefruit like drink and were encouraged to go eat lunch on the property as the rooms were not yet ready. We ate our first lunch at Chili's...an on site restaurant not associated in any way with the chain. The lunch was served buffet style and was acceptable. Lots of choices, fresh fruits, ice cream, hamburgers, chicken, pizza, salad bar. After lunch, we waited another hour and then were able to check in to the rooms. The rooms were located on the 1st floor and were very clean, nice sized and comfortable. The refrigerators were stocked with Corona beer, Pepsi, 7-Up, water and orange drink. Above the refrigerator, were 4 types of liquor ready to dispense. The refrigerators in both rooms worked great and kept the beverages very cold. The beverages were included in the price and were re-stocked on a daily basis. The shower/jacuzzi tub combination was nice. I did not try the jacuzzi but the shower head was on a flexible metal hose and could be hand held. The shower water pressure was quite good. The a/c units were quiet and worked very well. The room was cleaned on a daily basis usually by lunchtime. The pool and beach area had plenty of chairs and places to lay out/relax. As you got closer to the beach area, there were a few topless bathers. But around the pool area the dress code was swimsuits on. The bar at the pool was nice and service was okay. Occasionally , the bar was quite crowded and you would have to wait 5 minutes for a drink. However, waiters would also come by your lounge chair periodically and take drink orders and return in a timely manner with your drink. The swimming pool was nice and huge. It never felt over crowded. Service: The staff was always friendly and helpful. Service was always very good. We had absolutely no complaints at any time regarding the staff and the service. Teresa coordinated the games/activities at the pool area and was very top-notch, friendly and professional. The waiters/waitresses were always helpful and friendly. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner at all restaurant locations. Plates were removed from the table in a very timely manner. With regard to the restaurants, please see below for a brief review: Breakfast at Don Manulo: 7:00-10:30 Each morning I went to breakfast while the rest of the family slept in. Breakfast has always been my favorite meal. The restaurant had an omelet station that was very good. The coffee was served hot. The bacon was excellent. The fried eggs were great. The fresh fruits and juices were very good. The french toast was not good as it was prepared using bread that had rye seeds in it. The rest of the breakfast was great. Lunch: Don Manulo: 1:00 This restaurant was one of two that served lunch. It was the better of the two as it was more of structured lunch. It was also a buffet, but some of the menu items would change from day to day. The lunch at this restaurant and at Chili's were, after the first two days, getting pretty old quick. It was the same stuff day after day. Yes, there was a large selection but, except for the fresh fruits and salad, most of the food just was not that great. The soup each day was hit and miss. One day the soup would be great and the next it would be dreadful. The fresh fish (white fish) was decent but the tuna tasted very fishy. No shrimp at lunch. Chilis: 12:00-3:00 This restaurant was located closer to the pool area and allowed you to come straight from the pool to the buffet line. The food was marginal. Cheese pizza tasted like the frozen boxed variety. The guacamole was outstanding. Hamburgers were the 70% lean variety and looked very greasy. Chicken was okay. This was not my favorite lunch time restaurant. It was average. Dinners: You had to make a reservation at least the day before to get a \"seating\" at one of the five Specialty restaurants. In order to make reservations, you had to meet with a lady near the lobby at 12:00 or shortly thereafter. The lady had a spreadsheet for each restaurant where she would sign you up for a particular seating time. There is a limited number of seats for each restaurant. However, it should be noted that at no time were any of the restaurants near full capacity. So I never completely understood why she indicated some were not available at a particular time. Seatings were at 6:30 or 8:30. The first day we arrived on site, we met with the representative at about 12:45. When we met her that 1st day the only restaurant available for reservations was the Agave \"Mexicana\" restaurant. So, we reserved this the 1st night and reserved the japanese restaurant the 2nd night and the brazilian restaurant the 3rd night. She would not let us reserve any more restaurant further than 2 days out. 1st night Agave Mexicana: This was a very good restaurant. Probably our 2nd favorite. The tortilla soup was fantastic. The appetizer bar was great and the entrees were pretty darn good. Not much to complain about at this restaurant. The head waiter went out of his way to make my wife feel special as it was her birthday. They brought out a cake and sang Happy Birthday in Spanish. Then they brought out a fresh bottle of champagne. I think the head waiter and staff were excellent. Chilis Steakhouse: The rib eye steak was excellent as was the baked potato. The salad bar was very good and the desserts were also good. This was probably our favorite restaurant (at dinner time) on the property. Yashima \"Japonesa\": The sushi was very good. The soup was horrible. The saki was not very good. The steak was just okay, and the chicken was average. The dessert was good. This was our least favorite restaurant. I guess we were spoiled by staying at the Royal Hideaway Playacar the summer before. The japanase restaurant at Royal Hideaway was fantastic. The Yashima restaurant at Riu paled in comparison. Botafogo \"Rodizio\": This Brazilian restaurant was okay. The salad bar was good. The waiters brought out 5 different types of meats. Some were good (steak, chicken, turkey). Some meats were not so good (pork and sausage). The soup was terrible..some type of weak bean soup. The desserts were served buffet style and were fairly good. This was our 3rd favorite restaurant. Don Manulo: This restaurant required no reservation. Dinner was served buffet style each night. A different dinner theme was in effect each night. The night we went the theme was oriental. It was terrible. The duck was okay. The soups were horrible. The egg rolls were greasy. It was our least favorite meal of the trip. Maybe a different theme night would yield better results. But I recommend you avoid oriental night. Off site: The kids (21 and 17) went one afternoon to swim with the dolphins. They had an outstanding time and loved it. Summary: Overall, the resort was very nice and clean. The staff were outstanding. Pools/beach were very nice. Food was hit and miss. Drinks were good. It was a great family vacation spot.

The sandy beach area is still large, the shade is much better than our last trip and view is still excellent Water was like warm milk - but if your looking for that long romantic walk - forget this beach- head further down south of Playa ( actually , in the many years we have been visiting the various islands and coast-lines - long romantic walks are overrated in the tropics) - We are happy with the view, sound, smell and relaxation! Rooms Excellent - everything worked perfect - left around $5 US on alternating days and the room was done by 2pm daily with some really cool towel art each day including a rabbit with \" sticker\" eyes , nose and mouth ( have not seen that before) Mini Bar This was interesting - on the 4th day we ran out of Rum - I called the front desk and requested a new bottle - in about 30 minutes a man brought a new bottle and left - then 30 minutes later another man showed up with another bottle of Rum - I tried to explain that w e were fine, but he did not speak English - he looked at the newly stocked rum bottle - played with the spout and smiled and left - then came back - replaced the spout ( which worked perfectly in the first place) - satisfied he had done his job he left with a small tip Food Better than average AI food Specialty Restaurants We dined at the Asian and Brazilian - both OK Room Service Only breakfast once, and it was good Pool - Bars Great service - nice pools Remember to TIP Night life - entertainment Never saw - Iberostar has better ( although really cheesy) fun entertainment after a day at the beach and drinking Diving Used Scuba Caribe - great staff - good diving ( a few of the reefs were as good as Cayman ) - went to the Cenotes for the first time and WOW If you do not dive - do the discover scuba - best I have seen at any resort ( they actually take you for two tanks and RE AL reefs) Spa My wife said the first time they were too rough - this trip too soft I don't know what she is talking about??

We were there from June 22nd \u2013 June 29th 2007 and our experience was great. I\u2019m going to break things down into categories. Staff - From the moment we arrived until we left for the airport the staff was excellent. They went out of there way to make sure we were having a great time. We didn't walk past a staff person without being greeted with a warm smile and a Hola! The entertainment staff was engaging and energetic. They made us feel like this was more than just a job to them. They seemed to sincerely care that we were having a good time. Rooms \u2013 The room was very nice, clean and we had a wonderful courtyard view. If I had to knock anything it would be the concrete beds. These beds were beyond firm however, if you ask they will provide a foam (egg crate) cover over it which makes it bearable. We had a little trouble with our card key, but they immediately sent someone to fix it for us. The housekeeping staff did a great job personalizing there work with towels folded into animal characters. If you\u2019re a light sleeper you may want to bring ear plugs. You may hear a few doors slamming as people come in late. The doors are solid wood and all the floors are tile so it tends to echo down the halls a bit. Restaurants \u2013 We ate at every restaurant on the property and enjoyed all of them. They have five and you need to make reservations in advance for all but the buffet. The buffet has a different theme each night so I recommend if you check the schedule and factor that in when you\u2019re making your reservations. Take this for what it\u2019s worth, but we found that the fillet mignon was a bit tough and not very flavorful. On the other hand the rib-eye was just the opposite. Pools - I walked through every RIU property and in my opinion the Palace Riviera Maya was laid out the best. I like the size and the unobstructed view of the entire pool area. The entertainment staff sets up water volleyball on one end of the large pool and holds daily exercise sessions in the center which was very popular. They also offered free diving lessons in the pool twice a day. The pool area was clean and had plenty of cushioned beach chairs available. They also provide you with a towel card which you exchange for a clean beach towel when you need it. You simply return the towel and get your card back. So save the packing space you won\u2019t need towels. Beach \u2013 While it\u2019s true the beach erosion is significant there is still a nice swim able beach area and the beaches on the other properties are available and very nice. One half of the Palace beach area is rocky and the other is beautiful. I\u2019m posting two beach pictures that illustrate what I mean. One picture was taken from center property looking left and the other center right. Chichen Itza Tour \u2013 I know this has nothing to do with the Hotel, but I wanted to mention this tour. It was a full twelve hours with much of it being travel time, but it was well worth it. I highly recommend it. However, be warned that the tour bus will stop at a gift store on the way and while it\u2019s true they will barter and you\u2019ll walk away feeling like you got a good deal you will find better deals inside Chichen Itza. Chichen Itza has several flee market vendors on the park streets, and they have excellent prices. Airport - Again I know this has nothing to do with the Hotel, but be warned that when you arrive in the Cancun airport lobby you will be greeted by men warring Hawaiian shirts that seem to be like a welcoming committee. In fact they are trying to get you to visit client resorts and I\u2019m told even though they claim otherwise you will be hit up for time shares. Use your own discretion, but beware! The bottom line is we absolutely loved the resort and would definitely go there again in the future. I might consider packing a light air mattress next time, but I would definitely recommend this Hotel.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cHad a great and relaxing time\u201d", "Author": "dswrlh", "ReviewID": "UR8097099", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from the resort and feel completely reviatilized.

You won't find much to do on property in the evenings. There is a Sports bar and a Lobby bar, both were pretty lame. A good place for a drink buth not much more. 2. Take the $5 cab to Playa del Carmen and go to the shopping district at night. There is a Senor Frogs and a Carlos -n- Charlies which were lots of fun at night to hang out, drink, and listen to music. 3. The Riu was not in my opinion a place for a honeymoon if you are in your 20's. It wasn't the party atmosphere that Sandals offers to the younger couples. 4.

The other restuarants were pretty good. I was hoping for more authentic Mexican food at the Mexican restaurant. I had garlic shrimp and my husband had the beef tenderloin, which was served with mashed potatoes. It was good food, just not what I was expecting. The pool is awesome!

The only complaint I had is with the water sports. It says online and in the brochures that sea kayaks, hobbie cats, wind surfers, etc. are available for the hotel guests to use. Well, that is true, but they aren't at OUR hotel. The water sports are at the Riu Playacar. This is a 10 minute walk down the street (you can't walk down the beach) to get to the Riu Playacar. I know it is because of the lack of beach at the Palace, but there were people at our hotel renting out water sports. So, if a company can come in and charge you, why couldn't they just have the equipment for us at our hotel? The town of Playa Del Carmen is a little expensive. You can find good silver there though. Buy silver in town, NOT at the hotel! I really liked a silver bangle at the hotel and it was $168 USD. I found one very similar in a shop for $60 USD.

The resort was full when were were there, and there were plenty of hotel employees-- even at full capacity, the service was amazing! We really enjoyed the food. Believe it or not, the food at the buffet was (in our opinion) better than the restaurants. Fresh fish, scallops, crab claws, etc... every night there was something different-- not like other buffets where they fix the exact same thing every day. Go fishing and bring back some of your catch. They will cook it for you and make ceviche (BEST meal of the trip). The diving is incredible... we went with the dive group that is on site (scuba caribe) and they were very professional. We dove twice off playa and twice in cozumel. Playa is nice for diving, but if you are a diver, you are so close to cozumel ...you really should check it out!! I read the reviews on TA, and they were all correct about the hard bed. We requested a mattress pad on the first night, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The only issue we had... the air conditioner in the room stopped working properly. We reported it and it was fixed immediately. The front desk even called later that day to make sure it was corrected to our satisfaction. The hotel was very clean and had the best ocean breeze... it was great! This was not a place for kids. We hardly saw any when were were there (which we enjoyed!).

Don't expect to find a rowdy, party scene, which is great for couples and families. The grounds and rooms are clean and the staff is friendly enough. The pool area is very nice but does get relatively warm in the afternoon. We used that time to jump in the ocean instead. By the way, Islas was the only bartender we found who could make a good mojito. I thought the food was pretty good and I've stayed at 4 other all-inclusives before so I am able to benchmark. Only a couple of bad things: 1) Beds are hard but you can request a mattress foam. 2) If you visit any other Riu resort, they absolutely will not give you a towel so bring one from your own hotel. 3) I called the front desk at 11:20pm to set up a wake-up call. After ringing for 2 minutes, someone answered and said, \"No service now\" and hung up on me!! 4) Don't expect to use the kayaks or catamarans from the hotel. They make you walk down to Riu Playacar because apparently you can't launch them from our beach, but can be sailed in or out. Yeah, makes perfect sense. 5) This is the worst one - the bride and groom were in discussions over the tuxedo being cleaned and pressed from the minute they arrived at the hotel. Apparently housekeeping put it up in their closet instead of taking it and the couple didn't realize it until the night before. Thankfully they got it back in time. Then on the day of checkout, the cleaners insisted they cleaned and pressed the wedding dress although the bride did not request it nor was the service done! The hotel manager argued with my friends for an HOUR over 270 pesos (approx. $25)!!! They kept insisting they should pay for the service. There was no invoice to prove this either. I said to my friend in front of the manager to stop arguing with them, just don't pay it. You brought 32 people to their hotel spending approx. $25,000, tipped their waiters and bartenders and they want to argue with you over $25! The RIU should just eat the cost and pay those stupid cleaners. Absolutely unbelievable. What a way to end their wedding weekend. Just an FYI that my friend's co-worker got married here and said she had problems. Seems like all the employees are new around there and don't know what's going on.

There was not a speck a dirt anywhere to be found inside or outside this resort, I kid you not.It was the most beautiful resort I have ever seen. The drinks were incredible.Claudia at the sports bar made the best pina colada's. The service at the pool could not be beat. Every time you turned around someone was asking you if you needed anything. The best part was the little cart they pushed around and stopped right in front of you and asked if you would like a drink.I loved it!!! The rooms were very nice.tile floors,double sinks and a nice balcony. Our refrigerator was always full of bottled water, corona and soda. It helps to leave a little something for the maid everyday. Also, please tip these poor people. they work so hard and they really deserve it and appreciate it very much. To sum this all up, it was the best vacation ever! If i have to complain about something, it would have to be the keys sticking, and having a little trouble getting into our room. Some times it would take as many as 10-12 tries to get in. But, we always got in without any assistance. Also, the entertainment could use a little work. Grease was good, we enjoyed that very much. I would definitely recommend this resort to friends.

Positives: Food at specialty restaurants was on the whole very good. Japanesse was excellant. Brazialian very good. Staff was very helpful and I never felt pressured to tip. I did tip often however and it was much appreciated and graciously accepted. Did intro. scuba at Scuba Carribe which is in the hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful although diving off the beach in Playa isn't that great of an experience. Pool was nice and frankly sedate. Negatives: Beach is small and rocky although I don't like to hangout in the sand anyway. Booking specialy restaurants: Why is this such a hasstle? Will someone please explain to me why you must go stand in line (between noon and 3 I think) to book a reservation at this type of resort? This was a hasstle because we had tours/activities scheduled most days and couldn't make the times.

The hotel is really like a big castle. Everything inside looks really new, beautiful and expensive. The swimming pool is big and great. You really feel like a royalty when you stay in this resort. The service is really great. The workers speak english, always smile to you, usually remember who you are. The food and the drinks were simply amazing. I don't remember trying a single thing and not liking it. They have 5 a la carte restaurants which u can book every single day, but even if u don't the buffet is just as good if not better. Buffet also sometimes has theme dinners. Now the downside........the beach! I was really dissapointed to find out that the beach is so rocky that you can't go into the water or do any sort of sports there. You either have to stay by the pool or go to a different RIU resort for the beach. We went 3 times to riu palace mexico which was 10-15 minute walk. The beach there is still ruined from the hurricane of 2 years ago but at least u can swim there. About entertainment........they do have shows every night, but they are not interactive and fun. They are just beautiful shows to see and relax. There weren't a lot of people in the resort either. For young people who like to party there is a disco in riu tequila which me and friends thought that it kinda sucked, so no real partying every night. We took a club hoping tour to cancun and that was really amazing. The clubs are wild there if u like to party lke we do :) So I would recomend this hotel to older people or couples, not so much to younge people who want to party. And for the adventure loving people.......i really suggest taking the Coba adventure tour. You walk through a rainforest, zip line across a lagune, climb ancient mayan temples, and swim in a cenote(an underground cave)....its a lot of fun! If you like snorkelling, take a tour to Xel-Ha, you won't regret it!

We had a great time, and wish that we'd stayed for at most 10 days instead of six. I read many reviews before leaving so was a little worried about what to expect. Once I arrived, however, I found it hard to find anything to complain about, and was very impressed. To start out, the service is impeccable. The waitstaff is very courteous and out to please. The first day we arrived, we were each greeted with a cold glass of corona, which went down smoothly. We visited the buffet that night and couldn't believe how attentive the servers were. A fork was dropped and two-seconds later they already had given my sister-in-law a new one. I took literally three sips of my wine and they were already refilling the glass! Our maid did a great job, too, at cleaning our room. Everyday we left her $2 on the bed and she always had fresh towels for us, some of which were made into cute towel-animals. I also was impressed with the service that the bartenders provided - at the lobby bar, sports bar, and daquiri bar. These people definately deserve a tip every now and then from guests because they are always hustling to serve everyone (with a smile). We expecially enjoyed how Islas at the Havana bar called everyone \"captain\" in his spanish accent. As for the atmosphere and food. We found the hotel to be very clean. The grounds are well-kept, the beach area with chairs (which there are plenty of) is clean, the pool is very clean (which wasn't the case for the Riu Tequilla when we were there), and our hotel room was clean. We also enjoyed the food. The buffet for breakfast, dinner and lunch always had a wide selection to choose from. Anyone who claims to be sick of the buffet should quit getting the same thing or try one of the many restaurants. It was easy to get reservations for the restaurants. You can only make two at a time, but we always stopped in the lobby around noon and got what we wanted. Our favorites were the gourmet and japanese restaurants; try not to miss these. My sister-in-law, who has never really had sushi before, nor liked the idea of trying it, loved it. None of us got sick from any of the food either, even after consuming salads and raw fruits and vegetables. What would we complain about? I guess I can offer some complaints, but they are really minor. One, we had some trouble getting our room key to work the first couple of nights. We heard that we weren't the only ones. Whenever we told the front desk they always immediately had someone up to help us. Eventually, we were able to get our key to work regularly. Two, we called prior to coming to make sure that they had our reservation. Unfortunatly, they don't have a toll free number so we had to purchase a calling card. It would be nice if they, like some other resorts in Mexico, had a toll free number. When we called, we also requested to have two double-beds and mattress toppers since we had heard that the beds are very hard. When we arrived, we found our room to have, instead of two separate double-beds, two beds pushed together with a gigantic headboard. My husband and I just slept on one side and his sister on the other, it really didn't seem worth complaining about since we got a room with such a large balcony. We also never received mattress toppers, even after making another request to the front desk when we arrived. The first night we didn't sleep well because of how hard the beds were, but evenutally you get used to it. Overall, we had a great time at the Riu Palace Riveria Maya. The activities people work really hard, and even though the nightly entertainment can be a little cheesy and the daily activities can be redundant, we had fun watching the shows and playing volleyball during the day. One day we also went to the Riu Palace Mexico and discovered that we liked our place more. Although they have a larger beach area, we did not like the set-up of their pool and agreed that some areas like the blue-faded tiles that form a wall on the sides of the pool could be replaced or repainted, since they made the place look old. For three people in their late twenties, we had a great time. I would say that there were a lot of honeymooners and older couples at the Palace Riveria Maya, so if your single and looking for a mate, its probably not going to happen here. However, you will have a great time and many wonderful memories to treasure.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel Terrible Food\u201d", "Author": "bigsexynlv", "ReviewID": "UR7780623", "Content": "Just returned from Playa Del Carmen and was less than impressed.

We were somewhat concerned because of the seveal bad reviews that were posted a few weeks before we left. Since we had stayed at the Riu Palace-Las Americas in Cancun, we wanted to stay at this new Riu hotel in Playa del Carmen. There was no need to worry and it was our best vacation ever. A very clean and beautiful hotel! There is plenty of beach area with lots of chairs and palm trees available. There is plenty of beach area away from the rocks to get in the water. It seemed that there were plenty of chairs around the pool as well. The pool scene was a lot of fun. Everyone was very friendly and not stuffy. All ages were represented and everyone was having a good time. There were very few kids which we appreciated. Bar service was excellent here as well as all the other bar areas. We asked for a room with a nice view (garden view was booked which is on the outside of the hotel) and was given a suite on the end overlooking the pool. It had easy access to the pool area and the Chilis restaurant/Steak house at night. Even though we were on the end of the hotel, it did not seem like a bad walk up to the main lobby area. We did not notice excess noise or slamming of doors when we were there. The food was wonderful at the Buffet, the Steak House, and Sir Oliver's restaurant. We did not go to any other \"reservation\" restaurants but several said that the Japanese restaurant was good as well. Be sure to try the coconut ice cream every chance you get. There is no ice cream like it in the States. It is the very best. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Be sure to say \"Hi!\" to Alex the doorman. We had first met him in Cancun and it was a pleasure to see him again. Anything that you need to be replenished in your room refrigerator---just call the front desk and it will be taken care of. If you stay here at the Riu Palace-Riviera Maya then you can go visit all of the other Riu resorts that are located close by. Everything but dinner at night is all inclusive at the other resorts.. We started walking to the other resorts but it is further than you think. A taxi only costs $5 between resorts or $5 to go from this resort to 5th avenue. A pretty good deal in the sun and humidity.

Other members of the group had good experiences at the restaurants but preferred the buffet. The only significant complaint was the hall noise due to the granite and tile flooring.

It matched our expectations. What impressed us the most was the staff and how friendly and hard they work.

Our group also took the para sailing and wave runners. You can negotiate the price. The buffet worked out great for us everyday for breakfast, lunch and snacks. We dined at the Japanese (Yashima?) and Sir Olivers and had a nice meal at both, although we thought the best part of the Japanese was the assorted sushi at the beginning of the meal. Don't be afraid to order some wine and sake... We stayed in a jacuzzi suite (there are eight), and a couple of jr. suites with balconys' and courtyard views. All very nice. The jacuzzi suite would have been better with two sinks, but still worked well for us. They are 700 sq. ft +. The problem was the beautiful wooden doors on all the rooms in the hotel. Unless you stop and hold them until they close, which we did, they make a very very large bang, which will disturb most people. The pools were fun, and not too cold this time of year. We walked down to the Riu Yucatan by beach/ocean (not recommended) and walked partially back by road as there is beach erosion in between. We had the same experience with the beach towels, but just dried out in the sun, put our shirts and sandals on and had a nice buffet lunch there and swam in the ocean. Victor in the lobby bar is very friendly and makes wonderful drinks. We gathered there before dinner in the evening. We ejoyed the fact that that there were so many people from different countrys'. We made many new friends during our stay, staff among them. The sports bar was fun for a few games of pool. We played people from other countries and made it sort of a junior olympic's, great fun. We played for free drinks of your choice. The shuttle service that the hotel uses needs to streamline their process of booking. We emailed all of our information, arrivals and departures, and still had to go to the lobby the next morning for the obilgatory tour sales pitch, not necessay, and still had to check back the day before our departure. We had two different departures and they totally messed it up. Fortunately, we were available and ready to depart, but we spend 5 hours in the Cancun airport because of their mis cue. We feel that a hotel of this caliber should automatically have concierge serive available for the guests. After all, it is a different country and situations come up. We had two, where we just needed some telephone numbers to either make dinner reservations, or contact other services. The telphone operators could not assist, and did not call back, and there are no telephone books in the rooms. It was explained to us the yellow pages in Mexico are different. Finally one of the hotel front desk staff were able to call a relative and get one of the telephone numbers for us. A concierge would have been easier for everyone and taken a lot less time for everyone. Thank you Sara and Martha.

I feel that the Riu was a smaller hotel than the Iberostar, and everything was close at hand. The entertainment staff at the Riu wasn\u2019t as annoying as the Iberostar staff, either. If you didn't feel like doing something, they would just go around to the next person, and would leave you be. At the Iberostar, they sit there and beg you until you finally give in, and therefore, you aren't enthused to be doing what you want to be doing. The pool was excellent, and the temperature was just right. The sun chairs in the pool were a great asset. Be careful when you go to sit down @ the pool bar- if you have any momentum, you will go sliding across the stool, due to everyone's sunscreen rubbing off. However, there was a huge lack of music. It seemed that they would only play it from 11-noon, then again from 3-5ish. If you have a small battery operated speaker system (like for an ipod), BRING IT! Another gripe of the pool- there seemed to be quite the amount of smokers around, and sometimes even smoking in the pool. Also, if you have non-potty trained kids, please make sure that they are in diapers! There really isn't much of a beach, so if that is what you are looking for... The food was good and there was always something around to grab a bite of. However, if you are making reservations for dinner, there are only 2 times you can go- 6:30 or 8:45.

We have stayed at the Riu Bambu in Punta Cana previously, and I can say withot hesitation that is an excellent company!!!!! Highly recomended!!! From the second that you walk in the lobby, you can see that it is definately a step above many other resorts! The lobby was incredible, along with the lobby bar (they make the best drinks there, and have an even better view)!! The people at the front desk were very helpful, and friendly. The check in was a breeze.We gave the guy $20, and he gave us a fountain view room (overlooking the fountains, and pool with the ocean in the distance), when we had only payed for a garden view one. The pool was incredible- the water was refreshing and there are these chairs that are half in the water, that I enjoyed laying on.There were mini jacuzis in the pool as well as a good sized swim-up bar (always good to have). On the other side of the swim-up bar , there was a pool bar. The pool was beautiful-exactly how the look in pictures. No complaints what-so-ever!! As for the food- it was also fabulous. There was an average selection for breakfast (I mean it was just breakfast - how fancy can you get???). They had the same selection everyday, but it was great tasting.The lunch buffet was also great. There was a wide variety of lunch and snack items, and a few guys making custom orders of pasta, which was satisfying. I recommend going upstairs at the lunch/snack place for a spectacular view and breeze:) And for dinner.. dinner was amazing!!! There were a wide variety of a la carte resturants (mexican, japanese, gormet, brazillian, and the streakhouse) which are all wonderful- try all of them, just make sure to make reservations in the lobby. There was also a main buffet that was pretty average by my standards. I much enjoyed the other resturants!!! The overall taste of the food was great. It was always hot, and no one i was with experienced any problems due to food. Now, the beach is the only place that wasn't as great as i thought it would be. DONT GET ME WRONG- the beach WAS beautiful so dont read this thinking that the beach was bad:D The only things that i didn't like was the large amount of coral floating in the water (ewwww) , there was a little bit of rocks in the most shallow parts of the water, and the beach itself was a little too narrow for my likings. But on the plus side, there was an addition to the beach, between the pool, and the stairs that you go down to get to the lower part of the beach (that probably sounds confusing, but once you see it you'll see what i mean). There weren't as many palm trees as i would have liked( i think they were hurt by a hurricane a while back), but i'm a bit of a palm tree lover soo.... but like i said the beach OVERALL was great!! The bars were also incredible- there is imported brand name alchohol, which believe me, makes all the difference. The drinks were always nicely made!!! Loved it!! The rooms were nicely decorated, the beds were what you expect( not horrible, not great) and the bathroom was finished nicely as well. There were no problems with the toilet, shower, etc. The overall look of this resort was very glamorus, and filled with detail. Beautiful gardens, fountains,etc. It is impossible not to fall in love with this resort!! I was there for 2 weeks, and enjoyed every second of it!!!

Hard beds, bad food, terrible beach, no english speaking personnel etc. Not to worry!!! This place is a dream come true!! The hotel itself is wonderful. It is definately a 5 star hotel. Right from the time you walk in the lobby to the time you leave, the staff can not do enough for you. If there is ANYTHING you need, they are happy to provide. First, the hard beds - My husband and I both said that they beds were slightly firm, but did not stop you from getting a good nights sleep. If the beds are hard, they will provide an egg crate cushion for you. The sheets were clean, crisp and did not have an odor. Now the food - First let me tell you that my husband does not eat much. VERY PICKY eater!! My husband thought the food was wonderful. With the buffet, you can have anything you want, as much as you want and all food that we tried was very good. We only went to the steak house, Chilis, the first night. The steak was very tender and delicious. Breakfast was wonderful also. All types of foods, eggs prepared anyway you would like, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, cereals, yogurt and all types of toppings, breads and rolls (fantastic) bagels, meats and cheeses for sandwiches, etc. Coffee was very good!!!! Beach - if you like the beach and the water, it was a little hard to get to the water when you go past the wall. We swam in the ocean once and decided that we liked the pool much, much better. No salt water in the pool!!! Although if you just like the feel of the sand and laying out, there is an enormous area of beach that you can lay out at. Pool - Very large!! They have water activites every day. The sun loungers in the pool are a bit hard to lay on, but great for getting a wonderful tan!! The swim up pool bar is great. Sit in the water and have a few ice cold beverages to cool you down. In regards to the staff not speaking English - You are in a different country!!!!!!!!! If you want English then stay in the states. The staff knew enough english to get by. Besides - learn a little spanish before you go. Everyone says Hola to you so get used to it. Be friendly and respond with Hola!! Also take along $1.00 bills to tip the staff. They work long hard hours and greatly appreciate the tips. The activites staff work from 9:00 AM until 2:00 AM!!!!!!! They are wonderful and always try and get you involved in activities. The shows at night, put on by the activities staff are not professional, but good. They work very hard at these and deserve great applause. As you can tell by my review, my husband and I would go back tomorrow if we could!!!!!!! The only down side, and this is not the hotels fault, is the people who are ignorant and leave cigarette butts all over, on the concrete walks by the pool, all over the grounds etc. The staff does a great job cleaning, and is ALWAYS CLEANING, but the guests need to be a bit more tidy themselves!!!!!", "Date": "May 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay\u201d", "Author": "$", "ReviewID": "UR7438320", "Content": "We absolutely loved our 2 weeks at the Riu Palace (9th - 23rd April) and cannot fault the Hotel, or the staff, or the food - it was all 5*.

This is not meant to be a negative review, but I just want to reinforce what others have stated about the not so positive aspects of the RUI Palace. Final opinion: Had a great vacation (always do), beautiful resort, not worth the price, nor does it yet deserve the 5 star + rating. (Opinions based on extensive travel experience, staying in all kinds of hotels and resorts and having been to many all-inclusives in Mexico and the Carribean). Yes, the beach is not great (no fault of the resort, result of the 2005 Hurricane), but still had the opportunity to spend a whole morning swimming. The restaurant and bar staff work very hard and provide excellent service - no complaints. Food better than most all-inclusives and comparible to many cruises we have been on. The rooms (which are important to many) are not condusive to relaxing and sleeping soundly - very noisey as the halls are enclosed and the walls are thin so every small noise (I mean every noise!) echos in the room from the hall and between rooms (many people would leave their room door slam shut which would boom down the hallways). We have never experience this anywhere we have stayed - seemed to be the result of a bad design and cheap construction. Maid service inconsistent - and yes the towels were frayed and stained! It sounded trivial when I read the reviews before leaving about the running toilets, but we were travelling with my in-laws and they had one of these noisey toilets, and it was an annoyance - expected more from a relatively new resort. Front desk staff not very helpful and responsive - as someone said everything based on congeniality, but no action taken when something brought to their attention. Example: we were locked out of our room for about an hour on our last night because the our lock malfunctioned (even though Maid Service reported it at 11:00, maintenance staff didn't show up until 5:30 when we just arrived back from a day at the pool and discovered we couldn't get in our room at the same time). It subsequently took several calls and visits to the front desk, who seem oblivious and indiffernet to the whole matter to get access to our room, and then to get maid service to come to make up our room after 6:00 p.m. Also, we had three maintenace men in our room taking our lock apart and discussing the problem as we tried to pack and get ready for our last dinner, while the maid staff made up our room. Even though a vist during all of this from the Hospitality Manager, Stephanie, seemed like responsive action it was more smoke and mirrors about acknowleging the problem rather that taking action and trurly understanding the issue about why it took nearly 6 hours for maintenance to show up after the problem was reported, which in my opinion deserved all little more serious attention. My final piece of advice is if you are planning at staying at the RUI Palace you will have most likely have a good vacation. You would really have to try not to. If you are expecting an excellent vacation based on price and reputation you maybe a little disappointed, so don't base you decision soley on these factors.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dallas, tx", "Title": "\u201cNot so impressed\u201d", "Author": "TxSouthernbelle1", "ReviewID": "UR7420230", "Content": "While this hotel is beautiful the service and some other issues would keep me from staying or recommending this place to anyone.

This place is like a great big elaborately frosted cake that tastes like absolutely nothing. To be fair, apparently I'm just not a resort kind of girl, so it's very possible that the Riviera Maya really is the cherry on top when it comes to these sorts of travel destinations. But I have to wonder why anyone would go through all the bother of leaving their own country just to end up somewhere so nondescript? Let's begin with the food since so many people seem to think it's great. First of all, good luck getting any regional dishes on the buffet line. Oh yeah, except for the nacho chips with stadium-grade cheese sauce. Fortunately, if you do actually find yourself in the mood for something bordering on Mexican food, the Mexican restaurant usually has reservations available. Ironically, most people seem more interested in dining at the Japanese or Brazilian spots during their trip to Mexico. ??? If your culinary standards rest on the availability of all-you-can-eat buffets and convenience, you'll probably love the food. Don't forget to grab a stale Little Debbie croissant with your coffee. Or twelve. And now the hotel. The bed IS rock hard, but they stock your in-room fridge with Corona and water so it's pretty easy to overlook this minor detail. The rooms themselves are very nice and while you'll probably have an ant or two roaming the floors, step back and remember you are at the beach in Mexico. Those musty smells? Result of being at the beach in Mexico. You want everything sterile, take a trip to Disneyland. The service. Awesome but you get the feeling they're trained during orientation to say \"hola\" everytime a guest walks by in order to add to the \"cultural authenticity\" of the place. I realize that sounds incredibly pessimistic, but you'll see what I'm saying if you go. Nonetheless, everyone we came across was very helpful and sweet. (But the \"gratuity included\" claim is false unless you like being the jerk.) In closing, quantity vs. quality. What do you prefer? And do you really want to visit Mexico? Because anything on 5th Avenue would be way more fun, way more interesting, a lot less expensive, and a million times more Mexican than Riu Palace Riviera Maya. (Not that Playa del Carmen isn't by definition going to be \"touristy\" to a certain degree--but at least you'll know you're somewhere other than L.A.) P.S. If you do still decide to go, walking on the beach doesn't exist. You'll always find a lounger on the beach because most people were more interested in the pool than the crystal clear ocean 10 ft in front of them (???), but a stretch of sand doesn't exist. And walk to town. It takes all of 10 minutes. Straight out the front door and to the right. That's where the monkey is. P.P.S. They seem to have a problem with keys. We were greeted one morning by a lady who mistook our room for hers and used her key to walk right in (poor thing was very embarassed, but not her fault!). Take the safe to heart. P.P.P.S. You'll have fun regardless of all of this if you've got good traveling companions.

The food, particularly in the buffet, was excellent and despite the negative feedback, we had no problems with the booking process for the a la carte restaurants. My main issue was the fact that the whole resort was overrun by American tourists. Don't get me wrong I'm not anti American by any means, but they were absolutely overwhelming - so loud, so rude and so totally inconsiderate of everybody else around them. Every spare space on the beach was taken up by groups throwing a football, throwing a baseball, throwing a frisbee with no concern if it hit relaxing tourists and why did they need to keep up a running commentary all the time??!! Having spoken to fellow Brits, it appears that this was also the case in the pool area, despite the fact that the pool guidelines stated that no ballgames were permitted. If you complained you were laughed at and told to move in no uncertain terms. We were also very disappointed that the dress standards had been dropped in the restaurants to accommodate the fact that the American tourists were incapable of dressing smartly - they don't seem to understand the difference between smart and expensive.

The beaches in the Dominican are amazing. Food in the Brazilian restaurant was awful. The Buffet nightly was better. The buffet in the morning at at lunch were very nice. Some difficulties getting our room cleaned. The toilet ran and ran. The fridge made wierd noises (kept us awake) and we asked for fixes -they didn't happen. The walls were paper-thin. We could hear everything in the halls - lots of crying babies and kids running around screaming through the halls. The bed was like a slab of concrete. I typically stay in high-end inns & hotels with comfortable accomodations - this is *supposed* to be high-end and was not comfortable. Towels were stained and frayed. Sink was smashed. Shampoo dispenser broken. I was surprised since this place has only been open a year. Overall, the wait staff really try to please and always have a smile on their faces.

A bit of culture shock for me --- Mexican police (in Playa Del Carmen) and army guys (at a checkpoint on the way to Chichen-Itza) wear automatic weapons! They must have a need to use them??? We took the ferry to Cozumel - a waste of time. The city where the ferry leaves you is a dump. The ride on the ferry is very rough - I guess it's always that way. They handed out vomit bags.

We have been to 3 other Riu properties in Mexico but this was our first Palace. I would say that the hotels are very similar but the service is better at the palace. Waiters are always coming up to you to see if you need a drink or anything else. If you are travelling with kids, you may want to consider another Riu Property. There is NO childrens pool and we basically spent the week \"on guard\" making sure the kids didn't fall into the deep end. The only place for them to swim was the shallow area where the lounge chairs are built into the pool and there was always someone who didn't want to get splashed while laying in the pool - give me a break (there was a baby pool, but I've seen bigger puddles on the street). This brings me to another quick point, if you don't want to hear or be bothered by children on your holiday, book an adults only resort - there are so many 5 star resorts to choose from. Don't go to one with children and then look bothered by them. Children pay almost as much as an Adult rate and they are entitled to everything available to them, including the pool bar - they don't just serve alcohol there (by the way the drinks are great). The food was great and we found the buffet was the best place to eat simply because of the variety, you could always find something you liked. We only had one bad dining experience and that was at the Mexican specialty restaurant . My husband and I orderd the steak and it tasted alive. Our room was lovely, but there was quite a few ants crawling around. We were on the ground floor so I'm thinking that's prbably the reason. The cleaning lady was good, though I have no idea if it was the same lady everyday or not. Sometimes she would leave \"towel puppets\" on the bed for the kids and sometimes she wouldn't ( we left a tip for her everyday). The grounds are spotless and the pool is huge. There is room for everyone, but you have to get up early to reserve a lounge chair with a towel or you probably won't get one by the pool. They go fast. While we were there, there was a huge group of about 12 or 15 people that travelled together. Every morning they would take up that many lounge chairs and they would only use about four the entire day because they'd either be at the bar or just wandering around , very inconsiderate to other guests. The beach- if you are a beach person ( I am) , YOU WILL BE very dissapointed. The shore is covered with HUGE rocks. You can hardly get in for a swim. We watched a man try to do it and he fell and hurt his leg. We had to walk a few minutes to the next hotel for a safe swim.

Food at the buffet was excellent including all you could eat stone crab claws one evening, a Chinese Buffet evening with everything you could imagine, and if you are not a foodie than there is always pasta, salads and fruit. This resort gets a lot of negative reviews about the food, but I have to say if you are only eating hamburgers every day, then you're probably going to give it negative reviews. We saw countless adults eating hot dogs and pizza, never experimenting with local cuisine or with even the German Cuisine (as this is a German Hotel Chain). The beach in Playacar is having very bad erosion issues. If you are a beach family, I would suggest traveling to other areas such as North of Playa Del Carmen to the Iberostar or to the Mayakoba area. The staff was hard working and helpful throughout our stay. Our children enjoyed attending the children's camp which runs from 10 to 12:30 and from 3 to 4:30 each day. Then they have a kids disco at night for 45 minutes, so it allows the parents to have some downtime throughout their stay. These children's activities are all included in price (they played soccer, ping pong, swimming, art classes, dancing, volleyball). Drinks could of been more interesting and not as watered down as I'd like. The Margarita's were not good at all, and the only beer in the complex is Corona. Would of been nice to have a selection! We would definitely stay again if the beach situation improves, but it doesn't appear that the hotel chains (Occidental, Riu, Wyndam) are doing anything about it, and the government isn't fixing it.

Luckily we had a wonderful time. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, very formal. If you are looking for a hotel with open plaza's and lots of foliage, this is not the place. If you are looking for air conditioning and gorgeous tile and chandaliers, this is the place. The hotel is still relativly new, so everything is not fully grown. The pool bar is great. We loved the tables in the pool in front of the bar. Very fun!! The Mojito's are great. I think the food was great!! Everything from pasta, pizza, fresh fish, paella, croissants, breads, meats, huge salad bar, all the guacamole you can eat, chips, and so on.... I could go on and on. I loved the mimosas for breakfast. The rooms were great, very clean, our mini bar was filled with water every day. The beds were a little hard as noted earlier, all we did was ask the front desk for egg cushions for the beds, much better. Definately go into Playa Del Carmen and try the bar with the swings. So much fun!! The stores can be talked down with price, never accept the first price they tell you. The best part of the trip was the day trip scheduled through [--]. Eddie, one of the owners was wonderful. It may seem a little shady at first, he cannot pick you up at the entrance of your hotel, but it is completly safe. We went with only 3 women and felt completly safe. Eddie is wonderful, he is so knowledgable about the area and the people. He took us to an underground river to snorkel, then showed us a wonderful beach that is reserved for sea turtles, gorgeous, then off to a bay to snorkel with Sea Turtles. In the past the tour guides always assure us we will see Turtles, we never believe them, but Eddie did not lie. We got to swim with about 8 or 9 turtles, they were beautiful!! So fun!! After that, we did not think he could top the day, until he took us to the cutest beach bar for lunch. Authentic Mexican food, gorgeous views, and of course cold beers. The beach bar had swings at the bar instead of chairs, so fun. Only a local knows of the great hidden places. The afternoon was more snorkeling at a lagoon, nothing could compare to the Sea Turtles though. We had a wonderful time, Eddie is the best. Go to the web site and you can see pictures and info about the day trips. I would suggest this trip over the big ones scheduled at the hotels.

The hotel is beautiful and Stephanie Weffer (Assistant Manager) and her staff did all they could to ensure our stay and the wedding that we were attending at the hotel went well. The wedding was held in the gazebo near the pool and in front of the beach. The staff had everything set up perfectly. The hairdresser at the spa was amazing and did a fabulous job on our daughter's hair. The mariachi band added some extra ambiance to the wedding. We truly thank the hotel staff for all they did to make this a special day for our family. Now, some overall comments about the resort: The food was surprisingly good. There was always an excellent variety both at the specialty restaurants and at the buffet. It was always fresh and plentiful. Serving staff were well trained and even pulled out your chairs at the buffet. The upper beach is lovely and no difficulty finding chairs there or at the pool despite the hotel being full. One thing we really noticed was the lack of annoying beach vendors. This was greatly appreciated. The lower beach at the hotel was almost non existent but you could still get in the water easily. If you do want to walk on the beach you can walk 10 minutes down the road to the Riu Palace Mexico and walk on their beach to your heart's content. (enroute you pass a great little shopping area too) The hotel animation staff worked hard all day at activities on the beach and at the pool and it seemed all night too at the theatre area. We appreciated their friendliness and their energy. Although not a late night place (go into town for night life) they always had some children's entertainment each evening followed by a band and some evening show. Unfortunately the bands did not inspire us to dance and we did miss that opportunity. We did not see all the shows but the couple of shows we did get to were very good. The hotel is ideally situated to walk into town. It was only a 15 minute walk and you pass some small ruins on the way. If you prefer a taxi is only a $5 US cab ride. We truly enjoyed our trip and would go back to this area and a Riu again.

In one word I can some it up, the Riu Palace Riviera Maya is \"Outstanding!\" From the moment you enter this grand hotel, to the time you leave, RPRM will satisfy the most demanding traveler. My fiance and I began our week's vacation departing Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines 9:30 am, arrived about 12:30 pm in Cancun. We had booked private transportation through Getdita. They were waiting for us as we walked out the doors of the airport. Getdita has a website and their rates are fractionally more than shared transportation, I highly recommend them. I like that I do not have have to waste time waiting for people and stopping at many other hotels to let them off. Most importantly, I book my return flights as late in the day as possible and having the private transportation will allow you to enjoy more time at your resort with out having to leave hours early. Please beware at he airport in Cancun, of the timeshare people in the baggage claim area, they will ask you what hotel you are going to and lie telling you that they are your transportation. Just respectfully say no thank you and continue outside. Riu Palace Riviera Maya is located in Playacar, a private subdivision just south of Playa Del Carmen, It is a beautiful area with private homes and other hotels. As I arrived to RPRM the first words out of my mouth was \"wow!\" It has a majestic look. Marble and wood everywhere. Beautifully decorated. We were greeted handed a beverage and lead to the front desk where our check in was done with in 10 minutes. I asked if there were any rooms on the top floor available and sure enough my request was granted. As a Riu Class member, I knew from previous experience to ask for a mattress topper when I had made my reservations. Yes the beds are firm, known as European standard,I prefer it a little softer, however, once the foam egg crate mattress pad is on, I would sleep very well. The room was clean and nicely appointed and had a great view of the courtyard and the Caribbean Sea, I could see Cozumel in the distance. One quick story to begin, our first night we came back to our room about midnight, I opened the door and immediately saw the closet open and safe open. I left the safe open! The safe is in direct view as you open the main door having the closet open. Nothing was taken! We had our passports, bundles of cash in plain sight as well as our jewelry. The maid was most definitely in our room for the beds were turned down and the extra towels were brought as per my request. We were very fortunate to have someone with such integrity. Yes, I rewarded her for her kindness, but none the less, we were fortunate. The food at RPRM was great! I eat well and as my close friends would tell you that my brain is in my appetite. I can't be live from reading some of the reviews that one could not find and enjoy something in this wonderful place. Breakfast is a breakfast lovers dream, fresh fruit smoothies, eggs prepared to order with all the compliments, waffles/pancakes,fresh fruit etc... Lunch was served in the Grill and Steakhouse, close to the pool and beach area, every day, having different main dishes from which to choose. I found fresh fish, paellas, veal, pastas, too much in a good way. Dinner in the alacarte restaurants is a must. First of all the reservation complaints from some of the reviews is ludicrous. It is as simple as can be, all you need to do is go to the lobby bar between noon and 4pm and make reservations for 2 of the following nights. If one place is booked go to another and ask kindly to dine at that restaurant on another evening during your stay. It will take all of 5-10 minutes. (enjoy a cup of coffee or a frozen cocktail while waiting, you are on vacation) Find out which nights are the themed nights at the Don Manolo, the main dining room, and schedule your dining around it. The Don Manolo had a chef's night which was awesome. I am critical when it comes to buffets, this place will not disappoint. They have several cooking stations and are constantly replenishing other buffet stations keeping the food fresh and hot. Save room for desert! Some people were complaining that the desserts were not sweet enough, I actually prefer it this way not to over power the true taste instead of having a spoonful of sugar. Sir Oliver, the gourmet restaurant, is as good as the description states. As you walk in you are served a glass of champagne. I was also impressed that they served Chilean wines. Service, first class. Brazilian Rodizio was a meat lovers dream. You will start at the soup and salad bar, so don't fill up too much, then the waiters come to your table with skewers and slice off several types of meats, chicken and sausage accompanied by fresh vegetables. Again very good. We have eaten at the Japanese restaurants in other Rius so we passed this time. As for my past experience it is great if you are into fresh sushi and sashimi as well as some of your other Japanese favorites. Others at RPRM spoke highly of Yashima. We ate at the Agave which is their Mexican restaurant, and the Grill/Steakhouse, both very good. In the early evening, there is some live music in the courtyard and a pianist in the lobby bar. Every morning we worked out in an air-conditioned gym with plenty of equipment for a well rounded exercise program. Please do yourselves a favor and schedule a massage at the Renova Spa. Kristen and I had a couples massage and we came out feeling like a wet noodles. They were really good. Let me explain that there is plenty of beach and chairs but there were a lot of rocks in the water, apparently mother nature took the sand away by the shore. Not to worry, facing the ocean, go to the right, cutting through the Lupita's beach and grill area, and you will be able to swim. The other option which we did on several occasions was to go out of the main entrance of the hotel, make a left, and take a short 5 minute walk to the other Riu properties. There is also a shopping pavilion on the way, a great place for the souvenirs. We had lunch at Riu Palace Mexico and swam at their beach. You will also enjoy the beach at the Riu Yucatan. The pool at RPRM was great, there are built in sun loungers in the pool. Pool bar friendly and poured stout drinks. Make sure you ask for the call brands. I took advantage of the frozen drinks made with Havana Club rum. Entertainment was very good, not what you would expect from an all inclusive package. These kids are very talented. We would find out what shows are playing at the different Rius and go to which ever one caught our interest. Playa Del Carmen is with in safe walking distance, however, we opted for a cab, only $5us. We walked up 5th avenue and back on the beach, had lunch at The Blue Lobster. Ordered the lobster bisque and of course, a 3.5lb lobster! Playa was nice but a little too commercialized. Back at the RPRM, through out the day you will see the workers constantly cleaning the property and they seem to take the time to say \"hola\" as you pass by them. The staff and service was excellent. I noticed some people being rude to the staff, if you speak to them kindly and respectfully, they will treat you like royalty. Please bring some change to tip, these people work so hard, they deserve a little extra. I was so spoiled by the service we received, that it will be difficult to top. I have been fortunate to be well traveled and have stayed in the more known world class hotels, you will not be disappointed here. As you can tell, I am a Riu fan. With in a year's time we have stayed at the Riu Ocho Rios, Jamaica, Riu Palace Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Riu Palace Punta Cana,Dominican Republic, and next month, Riu Palace Las Americas. Our experience at their other properties have been so good that we have recommended our friends. Kristen and I were engaged at the Riu Palace Cabo San Lucas and have booked our up coming wedding there as well. I do not know of any higher recommendation I can give to this hotel or any of the Rius we have visited.

If it wasn't for the sunny and warm weather, the holiday would have been miserable. The property has a beautiful facade and the interior courtyard is striking with a European flair. Long narrow fountain pools lead to a large pool area with close proximity to the beach. The resort is large but everything is easily accessible. Unfortunately, those were the only positives. I was surprised that previous reviews didn't mention that the hotel has very dark interior (almost gloomy) hallways - not what one would expect in Mexico in a brand new resort. The front desk staff said that this is typical of Riu \"Palaces.\" Many lightbulbs in the hallways were burnt out and not changed throughout our 10 day stay. Security was minimal - there is someone standing on the driveway to the property but anyone can wander into the resort. The hotel is situated within the Playacar Village which is a highly travelled residential and resort area adjacent to Playa del Carmen. Doors to hotel rooms do not have peepholes/viewers. Although warned about it, the mustiness and mold smell in the lobby and rooms was overpowering. You get use to it while you're there but it lingers with you and your belongings when you return home. Front desk staff were not accommodating in many instances. It took over 2 hours to have someone repair a toilet despite repeated calls to the front desk (there is no dedicated housekeeping line). In general, housekeeping was poor. Rooms weren't cleaned until very late in the day. Towels in room and pool area were frayed and stained. Again, not acceptable for a brand new, \"5\" star resort. Food was OK and varied but not outstanding. Reservation restaurants were poor except Japanese which was good. Reviews are all relative to what you're accustomed to. Perhaps for those who have never been to an all-inclusive resort, this would have been a positive experience. However, this property is way overpriced for what you are getting.

We found the hotel to be very accomodating when possible right from the moment we checked in to when we checked out. We were encouraged once a week during dinner to fill out surveys and any complaint and/or suggestion we had was applied the following day. The food at the buffet for breakfast and dinner was superb! We did Chilis buffet for lunch only. We did do the Japanese, Brazilian and Gourmet and found them to all be very good. Our rooms were nice, beds are hard, but we have slept on worse. The housekeeping generally did a very good job with the odd day here and there of us having to request towels as they seemed to be overlooked at times. The beds were always turned down at night and additional towels placed in the bathroom when needed. The rooms were clean. The bar fridge in your room is replenished every morning and you only have to ask for your preference and it is met with no objection. The pool area gets a little crowded and yes, you do have to head out early in the morning usually 6:00 am to reserve your loungers, but should you not be successful, there are plently of loungers on the beach and the new palms have grown enough now to offer plently of shade when needed. We had an inicident which required the services of the hotel doctor. When contacted he arrived within 15 minutes and had a great \"bedside manner\" and everything was taken care of and we were able to enjoy the rest of our trip. The staff of this hotel is very congenial, professional and try to help you enjoy and make the most of your holiday. The entertainment staff is small, but they are very energetic and sociable and want you to have fun. Teresa is the team supervisor and ensures that Edna, Roman, Ely, etc. are doing their jobs.....in fact they do them so well, you can't help, but to laugh! The Lobby lounge is a nice place to meet when meeting up with someone or just waiting for your dinner reservation. The piano can get a bit loud and makes talking difficult. The Sports Bar is open 24 hrs should you feel yourself in need of a midnight snack or not want your evening to end you may continue drinking while you play pool (you have to pay to play the game). There are also internet services and games you can pay to use as well. It does get a bit smokey in here. It was great for us since some of the kids came in for spring break and tended to stay in this room which left the rest of the hotel much quieter! Staying at the Palace Maya allows you to use all 6 of their other resorts. The disco, which is at the Riu Tequilla tends to be very smokey and the young people tend to frequent this place. We found it easier to walk (or a $5.00 US taxi ride) to Play del Carmen to enjoy some of the night clubs there. Fifth Avenue is the strip to be on. Should you also care to dine outside the restaurant once in awhile, a restaurant called \"Limons\" is very good. Good Salso dancing can be found at Mombo Cafe, or should you care for the old disco music - the Blue Parrot is a fun hang our as well. The only way to know is to go and see! We did a couple day excursions - one to Excaret which took up most of the day viewing wildlife, swimming, eating and ending with a 1-1/2 show in the evening in their temple which is performed by 250 - 300 people and is phenominal! We also spent an afternoon in Peurto Aventuras which has a wonderful dolphin participation and viewing show. These mammals have been hurt at one time out in the ocean and can not go back as they will be killed by other sea creatures and live in this complex. They presently have three baby dolphins that will be introduded back to nature in a couple years once weaned from the mothers. The staff is very professional and the dolphins are adorable to see and it's free to watch.

We stayed 12 nights from Feb 19th through March 3rd. My fiance and I got married here, and all was a complete sucess. I loved it. I loved the way the entire staff made my lady feel on her special day. I loved the way the elegance of the Palace catapulted us to another level. She truly was made to feel like a princess on this day, aside from the fact that she already was, of course. To start, the curb appeal at this resort is amazing. The entire resort is impeccable. We did not notice any mildew, moldy smell, or see any grime whatsoever. Food was incredible, and take note that the food accessible all day long near the pool at Chills was in buffet form and totally incredible for that. Basically every option available you could ask for. Pastas, fruit, and all meats. Ice cream too. Specialty restaurants are run so efficiently. I loved them. At Sandals which we stayed at last year, a dinner could consume 2 hours, here, make it more like 45 minutes if you desired to leave right after your meal. Even at the evening buffet, they would treat it as though you were at a fine dining restaurant, and always pull out, and push in the chairs for the ladies. Room service was surprisingly quick. Anytime we'd call for a bottle of Champagne or other, they'd have it to our room within 10 minutes. We'd leave some money in the fridge, but they wouldn't take it unless we directly placed it in their hands. Quality of this resort in regards to cleanliness was much better than Sandals Ocho Rios which we stayed at last year. Gardens and plant life were manicured incredibly. Once again, the Wedding was so nice. As this was a palace, the whole ordeal made of feel very \"royal\", and they made my now wife truly feel like a princess. We were the only people to get married during our stay. We felt that they may have catered to us a bit more than others because of the wedding, but not completely sure. We did get a free room upgrade to Courtyard view even though we did not purchase the higher level wedding package. They also threw in a couple extra bottles of champagne at no charge. Resort could be considered small by some, but we thought of it more as convenient. Everything easy and quick to get to. No rain but a bit of wind. Great weather, 85 every day. Some kids around, but they mostly stayed away and were well mannered. If you have any questions, run them past me at ranalloj@msn.com. I've attached a few wedding pics.

The hotel is beautiful, and very elegant. I chose this hotel because this was my mother's first trip to the caribbean, and thought she should stay somewhere special. First of all, the food at this resort is fantastic. The service is excellent. The drinks flow constantly - I had champagne with breakfast, and dinner. Super. The employees work extremely hard, and are very friendly and attentive. Beautiful presentations at all meals. We didn't eat at any of the specialty restaurants because we could not get a decent time. Who wants to eat at 10 p.m. The pools are freezing cold, and didn't warm up much because there was NO SUN until our last day so that was the only day we swam. Sad. We had so much rain - we were so very disappointed. The beach is nonexistent. If you like to walk the beach, don't go here. Only a small swimming area too. Our room was beautiful, but we had no view and couldn't get it changed. Large bathroom with double sinks, big shower and jacuzzi tub. Great central air, and a ceiling fan. Beds were terribly hard (which I have encountered at other resorts), but these were made of granite, I believe. Good thing we were tired! Fully stocked liquor cabinet, and mixers, beer (Corona), pepsi products restocked every day. Do not take children of any age to this resort. There aren't many other activities for them, as it isn't a family style resort. We were also told there was a no spring breaker policy at this hotel - WRONG. About 20 big kids and their parents came in and the kids took over the pool and pool bar area. I am assuming there were a great deal of complaints (as the resort is full of 30-70 yr. old people), and the hotel management had parents get their newly drinking children under control. A five minute five dollar cab ride (or 20 minute walk) to Playa del Carmen, and you are in shopping utopia. You can shop for hours for all things Mexican and non-Mexican. Great nighlife too. Felt very safe - lots of police (also lots of military with rifles - don't be shocked). Overall, I would recommend this hotel to singles travelling together, married couples, or couples looking to have some nice romantic time together. The Cancun airport, however, had made my mind up to not return, and this was my 7th time to this part of the world. I purchased an expensive bottle of fine tequila for my husband, and was told to hand carry it through the airport because it would get taken out of my checked luggage. This was the advice of not just the hotel personnel, but several people who had traveled through the Cancun airport in the last year. I went through three security checks (yes three) at the Cancun airport. I made sure they checked in the bag, and in the box, and okayed it with them again and was told it was fine and passed on through. When I gave them my boarding pass at the door, they went through my stuff again (for the fourth time), and told me that since I didn't buy this tequila in the duty free shops there at the airport, they wouldn't let me take it on the plane. They wouldn't even bag it like the others because it hadn't come from the airport. They confiscated my gift for my husband, and let all the other people who purchased their stuff in the duty free shops take theirs on the plane. I didn't even have time to go to the shop afterward - I had to get on the bus to go out to the plane. I have gotten home many times and found my stuff had been rifled through, and had been missing even a bottle of Amaretto once. We should be able to lock our luggage!!! Enough is enough. Adios Cancun.

We had stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico two years ago and loved it, but thought we would try the new hotel this time. I booked the trip then became concerned after reading some negative reviews here, but they were all for naught. The hotel is absolutely spectacular and the service was outstanding. We got there at 12noon and they already had our room ready - we had requested a courtyard or ocean view via emailing the hotel, and we got a room with both courtyard and ocean views so we were very happy! I was concerned about the beach being small but no problem - always plenty of chairs and very enjoyable. My only complaint is there is no beach bar, just the pool bar which does not open until 10am. For someone who hits the beach at 8am, this was kind of a pain but not too bad. We took our big insulated mugs as we did before and they filled them right up. I did find that if you tip the bartender and ask for extra rum in your fozen drinks they wil be quite generous! Well worth it. We always take $100 in one-dollar bills for tips and such, and they are always well appreciated. I did not see anyone else tipping the wait staff and was rather surprised by this, considering the level of service. My husband couldn't even drain his glass, sit it down and count to five before someone was refilling it - not the usual service you see here in the States for sure! The room was a little smaller than at the Riu Palace Mexico. and the beds were very firm, but we like a firm mattress and who needs a huge room anyway? We didn't go to Mexico to sit around the room all the time - it was plenty of room for our needs. Loved the massage tub too! The buffet was certainly the best place to eat - the food was wonderful except for the desserts - they looked great but never seemed to have much flavor, but the ice cream was delicious so that can make up for any other dessert lapses. The weather turned cloudy and rainy during our last day-and-a-half there, but can't blame the hotel for that - we just went into Playa del Carmen and shopped instead of going to the beach.

That said we knew that before we travelled so no sense complainng. The food was fantastic, absolutely zero comlaints and we never had a moment of illness. We did all the ala carte restaurants with the Japanese our favourite! The days I felt under the weather was mostly likely self-inflicted---I love tequila! The staff were incredible and bent over backwards trying to insure that everyone's stay was perfect. A real nice touch I thought was that every night at the dinner buffet the \"head big wigs\" would make their presence known and circulated the room talking to the guests to see if any had concerns. During a previous RIU stay we had had some problems with our reservation, that info was brought forward this trip and the staff went out of their way making it up to us. My thanks and appreciation go out to Oswald, Stephanie and Sandra for all that you did! I would definetly go back to this resort but would not take our daughter, definetly more an \"adults only\" resort.

I agree with most everything that has been said in this forum so I won't rehash. Here's a couple of additional things I thought it might be good for people going there to know: .If you like to sit on your room's patio in shade on the afternoon then you need to be on the right side (if you are in the lobby facing towards pool) of the hotel. The left side gets all the afternoon sun rendering the patios unusable if you have had your fill of sun for the day. .We enjoyed the restaurants that we dined in (did not eat at the Brazilian). They have two seatings a night for each. The meals take longer because they basically serve a course to the entire restaurant before moving on to the next course. So if you are the first one in the door you will get your first course super fast but then wait a while until everyone else (including the stragglers who didn't respect the seating time) get their course served. No biggie, especially if you know. .The chair reserving is out of control. The staff gently let everyone know on Sunday that this practice was not allowed but it did not help. So, if you want a good chair, get down to the pool early. We did not reserve and usually got to the pool around 10:30 and always found a couple of chairs, but they were in the last row which is where we wanted to be anyway! .I do feel that I must rehash that the ice cream is just outstanding!

My best friend from high-school and I met there to enjoy a girlfriend get-a-way (sans husband, kids, job and dog) celebrating our 40th birthdays together. I researched the hotel extensively, on this site and others. After reading mostly positive reviews of Playa del Carmen and the RPRM we booked this trip through Expedia. The hotel and experience were just as I expected (from the positive reviews) and even better. I worked in the hotel industry for 12 years and am very particular. The hotel was amazingly beautiful (almost over the top) and spotless. I am an early waker and was usually on my very large balcony at 6am watching no less than 15 men literally scrub the sidewalks. The room, grounds, staff, pool, and food were all amazingly wonderful. Read through other reviews that mention many of these features positively. The staff, especially Alex and Victor, aim to please. Several things that I will share are details that I was curious about but didn't get much information on in other posts: 1. The food. I am a healthy eater and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of fresh and healthy offerings. From the breakfast bar with tons of toppings for yogurt (plain or flavored) or cereal (including flax seed, almonds, bran, etc.) to the fresh juice bar (try the one made of pineapple, parsley and spinach - you'll be surprised how good it is!). The breads were all so fresh and lots of whole grain choices at every meal. The fish was fabulous - don't miss the grouper in the Gourmet restaurant. This is not a health spa by any means, however. If you are looking forward to eating yourself silly, there is plenty of opportunity. But you won't find fat and preservative laden food that is so prevelant at \"all-inclusives\". The only negative that I could find was that the meats in Mexico are quite different than I am used to. The steaks were very good, but things like hamburger, hot dogs and sliced ham all had a funny, very strong taste. All in all, the meals were fabulous. Our favorite meal was in the Brazilian restaurant. 2. The musty order. Yes, it is noticible when you first arrive. But, you do get used to it. It didn't seem dirty or unhealthy however. It was definitely more noticable in the lobby. Now that I am home I can still smell it on my some of the clothing items that I haven't had time to wash. From what I understand this smell is present at most hotels in Cancun/Playa. Heck, I remember the same smell at a Walt Disney resort. I think it is from the humidity and can't really be helped - just covered up by chemicals - I would rather put up with the musty order. 3. The beach. At the time I was there (2/23-3/1) there was some beach available below the retainig wall, enough for approx. 30-40 lounge chairs. I swam several times. The waves were very strong, however. We spent an afternoon at the Riu Palace Mexico which has more of a beach. I still liked RPRM better for that overall beachy feeling. 4. The beds. Yep, they are hard. I called the front desk and asked for a pad. They delivered a very nice quality egg-crate mattress and completely remade each bed within 20 minutes of my call. 5. The drinks! They were large, good quality and you never had to wait to get one. In fact, they really pushed them on you - in a fun way. When we visited Riu Palace Mexico the drinks were served in much smaller glasses and were watered down. 6. I booked this through Expedia who did not offer transportation to/from the airport. It was easy to find a \"colectivo\" from the airport to the hotel but terribly hard to get one from the hotel back to the airport. Most people in the hotel were on package deals (mostly Apple and FunJet) and had everything taken care of. I felt a little left out in the cold with Expedia ( I even called them for help and they offered none) Eventually I booked my ride back through one of the above representatives at the hotel. I'm not sure they were supposed to really do this, however. All in all, it was a great, relaxing vacation.

We found the experience to be average at best. Pluses: Overall decor is elaborate and grounds quite impressive. We upgraded to a Courtyard room and were given a room on the 2nd floor at the ocean end of the building with magnificent views of the ocean. Upgrade definitely worth the price--our daughter's room was smelly and looked out on service court and next-door hotel a few feet away. The rooms are nice. The staff were always friendly and our room was immaculately clean. The food was good, especially the breakfasts and dinner in Sir Olivers, but certainly not outstanding. Japanese restaurant--bad food and only poor service of our stay. Spa, though not especially beautiful, provided excellent staff and services. Negatives: Who stole the elevators? The hotel is \"U\" shaped with arms at least a city block long. The only (tiny and banged up) elevators are in the corners of the closed (lobby) end of the \"U\". We had a choice of walking a block and a half each way to use the elevator and back to our room when going from beach to room or a two and a half flight walk-up. At these prices not acceptable. There was really no gathering place for our teenage grandkids in the evenings--or for adults except for the lobby bar. There was a \"show\" each night--staff amateur lip synch. We went in to the charming town of Playa del Carmen two nights--lots of music and lively entertainment. Extras such as spa and sundries shop cannot be charged to room--why?

Wim informed us at the check-in that shorts were fine here. ladies can wear anything dressy. i went casual dressy, but if you like to really look nice ~ the woman are dressed very nice here. very nice dresses, heels and beautiful jewelry ~hair and make-up done. very nice looking couples. i never felt out of place, but i didn't do the heels. i have two teen girls. they found very little to do. the sports bar got old for them. after dinner it was dead other than to sit in one of the bars. we were so full we didn't want any further drink. we walked down to the shopping area a couple nites after dinner. we went to 5th ave for dinner one nite, Wim from the front desk gave us a place to try per our request and he did great. shopping down there is best done a bit later in the day. it was just way too hot the one day we went down, we took a taxi back and returned for an evening shopping trip. i was under the impression that the other riu's were side by side. not the case. it is in a community of many resorts. we did not go to any of the other riu's. we loved ours and didn't want to leave the beach. we weren't looking for much nite life on this trip, so the other bars/disco didn't appeal to us. we did the parasailling from the guy on the beach. it was fun for the girls. one great thing is no one is on the beach selling stuff. the guy for parasailing etc walks up and down once in a while. he is available to you but i didn't really ever see him approaching people. no one is selling braids!! my girls have outgrown that and it was so nice to have a place that left them alone. i had booked a day with edventures, the large group trips are not for us. they were able to come right to our door. the family of four was able to spend a wonderful day in tulum snorkling, zip lining etc. ~ highly recommended!!!!!!! we wanted a very quiet, very relaxing vacation. this is the place for it. everyone was well behaved. a few days before we left a large group of 30ish singles showed up. they were very out of place. no partying to speak of here. they seemed to be having a good time, but again that group really seemed like they booked the wrong place. the mold ~ yes it was quite bad. the ceiling in the shower was covered black with it. yuk. but i fixed that by not looking up! we didn't run the air while in the room as i really dislike airconditioned air.... the mold smell seemed less when it wasn't on! the bathroom was very nice, the shower pressure was great. the room was ck'ed and cleaned several times a day. the cleaning staff does not speak english. they will smile at you when you ask a question. the meal staff can speak english and will make sure you leave with a little more knowledge of spanish! i enjoyed that. it took me a few days to get basic phrases down. one last thing. the tv sets are equipped for a dvd player(three colored holes in front) not that i wanted one, but i know how children enjoy their cartoons and movies. the cartoon station i saw was in spanish. if a kid is use to a few hours of tv a day, and you take them here, to long hot days and no tv to set them in front of for a quiet time..... well, good luck with that!! :) you do get cnn, espn, abc, nbc and some movie stations. i enjoy the tv on at bed time and was pleased to have a few stations to view. all in all a great beach/sun vacation.if you have any questions about the resort, airport, transportation etc, i would gladly reply from bluewaters3200 at yahoo dot com", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "B.C.", "Title": "\u201cAll I can say is \"Wow\"\u201d", "Author": "iminlovewithmexico", "ReviewID": "UR6843343", "Content": "My family and I ( a group of 6 adults and 1 child) arrived on Feb 17 and I was amazed as soon as I walked in the door.

Once again, staff works very hard. BEACH - Easy to get chairs, beach very eroded due to Hurricaine. If you want to walk stretches of beach, this resort is not for you. There is no place to walk. We loved the hammocks and my daugheter got a massage on the beach. Tip those waiters on the beach, they work so hard and are so appreciative for anything!! I personally was really annoyed that folks from the resort to the left, kept coming to the RUI beach with boat loads of kids and using the beach and Rui chairs.(Look at their blue wristbands). There are no that many charts down on the beach section. I told mgmt, they told the intruders, but they never left. No one kept an eye on this and there is a whole hut of RUI employees right near where they walk over. I think RUI needs security to monitor this all day long. I would never just use another resorts facilities. RUi was definately a nicer resort they did not pay to stay here. Some people are just the rude. Rooms - although we had it in writing we wanted a courtyard view, we did not get one until day 3. The front desk did not budge.I sort of lost it when we checked in. They said it was $50 more a night and they were sold out. Tons of folks we met at the pool got upgraded to the courtyard with no fee. We did find out that they overbooked at the other RUI's and upgrade alot of people to this RESORT free. So, the hotel had no rooms. That bothers me a little because I paid full price and fought to get the view I wanted. The room was great, air conditioning was fine. Need to call several times for beverages for frig. Slept great. I did not notice the mold when we were there. But when we got home we reaked and never knew it. Everything had to be washed and my suitcase sat out in freezing weather to air and still smells musty. But I still had a great time! I would go back, but they need to check that issue out. We love Play del Carmen. What a town!! Great shops and restaurants. Only a $5.00 cab ride.Went in every night. Carlos and Charlies really made us laugh. Stop in for drinks at these cool restaurants along 5th avenue. Some have little grottos, swings. Very cool. ADVENTURES- did a Mayan village excursion with 3 zip lines, swimming in beautiful cenotes, cool platform to jump off in cenote( I did it, wow, I was scared), a Shaaman ceremony in a cenote with candles and insense ( felt like I was going to Tribal Council), lunch made by Mayan folks. Very exciting. Horse back riding was great at Loma Bonita. You actually ride into the deep water at one point. Great tour guide. Light soft drinks and lunch included. Trip to Cozemel to snorkle was ok. I was not impressed at the locations we went to. We were in 40-70 feet of water and saw just some fish. The crew was fun, there are 20-30 tour booths for snorkling when you get off the ferry. I don't know how to recommend a good one. Overall, I love playa del carmen. I would go back to this RUI. It is 99% newer than the other RUI's in Playa(I went to see them). I think they need to work on the musty smell, otherwise, we had a wonderful time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cStaff Fantastic, Management Isn't\u201d", "Author": "elsamidwest", "ReviewID": "UR6805868", "Content": "My wife and I reserved a garden view room through out travel agent and when we arrived, management agrued that the top floor, view of the roof was the best he could do unless we were willing to slip him another $50 bucks a day.

I E.Mailed the hotel about 3 weeks before we went ( E.Mail address is on their website) and our request was honoured. I know a lot has been said about the hard beds but they did not give us any problems.The mini bar is well stocked when you arrive but ours was only restocked twice in the whole 2 weeks. You just need to contact reception though and they will send anything to your room you want. FOOD Lots of it and on the whole very good. Sometimes it was only lukewarm though particularly at lunch time. We had lunch twice at the Riu Palace Mexico (where we have stayed before) and the difference was unbelievable. The same food but hot! At dinner on one occasion we were seated for dinner and were ignored for over 10 minutes before eventually a waiter came and asked us what we would like to drink. They were too busy resetting tables. Once you had got a glass of wine it was often difficult to get a refill. We ate at 2 of the other restaurants Chilis and the Gourmet restaurant but on the whole the buffet was our favourite. POOL Excellent and plenty of loungers. Waiters are around all day getting drinks. BEACH A lot has been said about this but it's ok and on 2 occasions we went to the Riu Palace. The sea is wonderful and warm. BARS Good service but on a night if you want the branded alcohol make sure you ask for it by name. As in all the other Riu Hotels we have stayed in the Manager is very high profile and mixes with all the guests. So if there are any problems she would hopefully rectify them quickly. The staff are also very friendly and most are efficient. We only tipped at the end of our 2 weeks and to those staff who we felt deserved it.

The pool areas was fantastic, plenty of room (Although you do need to get up early to reserve lounges). The drinks were flowing so you never went thirsty. The beach area for lounging was good, but the waterfront area of the beach was subpar due to the erosion of beachfront. You could get in the ocean just south of the RPRM (In front of the Riu Lupita), but it wasn't a huge area. The breakfast and lunch buffets were above average (The main buffet a little better than the one at Chili's poolside) and offerred many choices. The Brazilian Steakhouse was not bad, but it was our least favorite of the ala cartes. The Japanese Restaurant was very good, Sir Olivers was good and Agave was good (The appetizer buffet was great, a lot of authentic Mexican fare-better than the entrees). We'd agree with previous reviews that the desserts were a little bland, except for the ice cream which was very good. All and all, the food was good and the service was great. The rooms were OK, maybe a just a little musty, but our A/C's worked fine (It automatically turns off when you open your sliding glass door to the balcony).

Let me start off by saying that the guests at this hotel are an older age group. My husband and I are in our late 30's and we felt like we were some of the youngest at the resort. At least it made the resort quiet....not a lot of roudy people running around. As many other people have posted, the beds are incredibly firm. If you ask the front desk for a foam mattress pad they will put one on the bed for you - no problem. The rooms are clean although there is a bad musty smell. We have been to other Caribbean islands before and realize that musty smells are common, but have never returned home and had to wash every piece of clothing (even things not worn) to get the musty smell out. Even the luggage reaked of mustiness........Not good. Also, there were a few little ant like bugs coming out of the sink drain. We had already unpacked and I didn't feel like moving around, so I just kept the drain plugs in to keep the bugs at bay.....it worked. Oh yeah, don't drink the water from the sink faucet. There is a little sticker on the mirror stating the water isn't potable but I heard some people saying they didn't see the sticker, had been drinking the water and were a little on the sick side. The pool is icy cold, but there are plenty of lounge chairs and we never had a problem finding a good spot, even in the sun. I did not notice a lot of early morning chair saving. By the way, the only jacuzzi's are located in the spa (not really outside). And like most others have noted, there is no beach with water access. The hotels to the right and left do have water access but the beach is rocky and the surf is rough. Just be careful around those rocks. I would consider the food only average......better than most all inclusive buffets, but an all inclusive buffet nonetheless. We ate at one of the reservation restaurants only once, and it didn't turn out well. We got a reservation at the steak restaurant for 7:00. Showed up around 6:50 and they seated us right away. The problem was that we didn't get our meals for 1 hour and 15 minutes after we sat down. The place was far from crowded, but from what we could see, they only had one chef cooking. My husband's steak was good but the pork loin I ordered was only a little more tender than the sandals I was wearing. If you like to eat dinner around 5:30-6:00 this is not the place for you. Dinner doesn't get going until 6:45. All in all, our vacation was good but I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone, friend or foe.

We really enjoyed our trip and I wanted to add some of my thoughts about the resort. First of all, the staff was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating and a few members of the staff became part of our rowdy group at times! When our air conditioning needed to be fixed, maintenance was there very quickly. The maids were very helpful and even ordered a Mexican hangover cure for me when I was moving a little slow one day. I thought the food was great and I am a notoriously picky eater. Everyone in my group enjoyed their entrees at each meal. The breakfast buffett was fabulous, with lots of fresh fruit and juices I had never tried before (Honeydew juice?). The only negative I would say about the food would be the fact that nothing was labeled. I'm not one to just try something and see if I like it. An adventurous eater, I am not. I have to at least know the basics. This is probably more a fault of my own than the resort's, though. The sports bar always had refrigerated sandwiches and late night snack food, which I thought was a nice touch. The drinks were very good and were served to us right on the beach. While lying on the beach or pool, you have to make sure you don't lose your towel. They have a \"towel card\" policy, of which we lived in fear. Lose your card or your towel, it'll cost $20! However, I lost my towel the third day and they gave me a new one. I don't think they are extremely strict about this policy. When deciding to call this resort a palace, they were not kidding! The lobby is very grande, marble everywhere, grounds immaculate, and everything is just very big. If you are looking for a quaint, small resort, this may not be for you.

Some of the other guests had the same complaint. I believe that their air conditioning system is faulty (built 1.5 years ago) and is responsible for this problem. I believe that we were subjected to mildew and mold, as our stuff (clothes, you name it) was noticeably smelly by the time we got back home. The restaurants were good, but the beach was bad.

Big mistake. First, I can say this resort is very clean and such--it looks a lot like the old Riu Palace, but when you look closer, it doesn't even compare. It was like they decided to try and improve the wheel and realized that when they made it bigger, it was more expensive than before. So, shortcuts were taken--the tile walkways were made with cheaper tile, they left out the bidets from the bathrooms (I was so bummed about that! Bad pun!), and forgot to insulate the walls. I was appalled at how LOUD the rooms were. If the A/C wasn't on (and if you have the room above 65, it shuts off for long periods), you could clearly hear conversations in the other rooms. And we were put right next to a family who was up at all hours, their kids banging on the door and yelling at 2-3 AM, running through the halls (which echo like crazy and amplify every sound), and yelling while in the room watching loud TV with the door open. My husband asked the father to quiet them down, but as he was in another room down the hall with family, it was still unbearable. The older Riu Palace has inner doors that block out most sound and made the rooms very quiet and private--again--they must've run out of money b/c the doors at this newer place kept out very little sound. When the family left, they were replaced with friends from Ohio who settled in the rooms on either side and yelled to each other from the balconies, and talked loudly. Again, if you FART in these rooms, I'm sure the neighbor could accurately rank you from 1-10. And don't waste your money and 'upgrade' to a courtyard room--you then get to hear the pounding pool music by day (we were at the beach, so it wasn't that big a deal) and drunk Americans yelling to each other from the walkways to the balconies by night, along with the night club pounding to 12 AM. Fine if you like to party and get drunk, but if you like to sleep and have peace in the evenings, well, check out Ikal del Mar--MUCH more peaceful and relaxing. Bed was very hard, but just ask for a pad--they gave us a lovely foam pad that made the bed quite comfortable. The service was great--everyone was friendly and helpful; the room was kept very clean and the tub was nice and deep for a good soak. I have no complaints about the staff, just the guests. The beach was okay--we walked over to the other Riu Palace to use their beach b/c it was a bit bigger and had no rocks. Not the resorts fault, the hurricane last year wiped out a lot of beaches. Food, I guess our tastes have changed a lot. If you like Applebees and see that as fine dining, the food will be very satisfying. I would rank the food as less than Applebees, more like Old Country Buffet. Edible, but nothing to write home about. Plenty of it to eat, and it's nice to just get something and not base it on price, but I found the salads really poor and not a lot of choices, so we stuck to stuff that is hard to mess up like the Mexican food. I wish these resorts would stop trying to please American palates and make authentic local cuisine; pizza in Mexico is not a really great culinary find. This visit has pretty much convinced us that all-inclusive is just not a good idea; free booze never makes for a restful time and bigger is definitely NOT better. If you love food, look at smaller places like Esencia and Ikal del Mar, or Meroma. The service, accommodations and food is unsurpassed at these smaller places, and you don't get the drunk idiots.", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Albert, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort, definelty would go back\u201d", "Author": "SparkyStAlbert", "ReviewID": "UR6712550", "Content": "My trip notes: My boyfriend and I returned from Mayan Riviera, staying at the Mayan Riviera RIU Palace Maya on Jan 23.2007.

Work out gym is a shame, so I ran into town (approx 15 mins) where they have a starbucks and worked out for 15 dollars US at AREA fitness which is great. For the amount of $ the value isn't here. The hotel web site pics look great but is really overpriced. Stay at the paradisus and you will be happier. Pools and beaches are better. No real complaints about the food. That made it livable, I would never go back to a RIU again. (This was our second attempt after RIU in Nassau which was worse.) We loved the Paradisus in the Mayan and wished we had booked there over Xmas 06 instead. Good luck! (PS I placed my daughter in the kids club for one afternoon and they had a 24 inch TV on a wobbly stand. I asked the lady who ran it if I could move the TV off the plastic stand onto the floor where it would be safe, I was worried that if a kid fell into the stand (as they ran around there) that the the TV might topple onto a kid, and she said \"TRUST ME, it won't fall off!

I'll divide everything into categories: -Check in: painful! although we originally requested a room with a good view, they booked us a room with a view of some big wall. When we asked for them to upgrade us, it took them THREE HOURS because they were \"cleaning the room\", which does not take three hours. After that, they apologized and we went to our room. -The rooms: very nice. mini bar was restocked daily with beer and sodas. also, above the minibar fridge are 4 kinds of liquors you can drink for free- there was bacardi, rum, brandy, and whiskey (i think). Those were also restocked whenever they were getting empty. The bathrooms came with shower caps, sewing kits, etc. The only problem with the room was the airconditioning and the fridge. The fridge was not cold and the airconditioning went on and off throughout the night so the temperature in the room was inconsistent all night. the TV has some good channels like fox and national geographic in english. -room service: i tried everything! the only good things were the CAESER SALAD it was SO good! also, the nachos of coarse. the deserts were not tasty at all. the cheesecake and chocolate cake were dry and bad. The food was always there witihin 15 minutes and they bring it into your room and put it down on the table for you. When you're done, leave it outside your door. Bars: VERY GOOD! drinks are delicious but unfortunately fattening. i gained five pounds in 1 week and it would have been more if i didnt smoke a pack a day. the bartenders are very nice and funny. all of them were very social and willing to help. the best drinks were the margaritas, mojitos, pina coladas, and the ernest hemingway. the mudslide and cosmopolitan are not as good as they are in the states. -Service: impecable! they wait on you hand and foot. they replace your ashtray after every cigarette, offer more drinks every few minutes, and are always smiling. on the first day, the employees called us twice to make sure everything was alright. tipping them makes them very happy so bring lots of singles! -Towel cards and keys: not fun to carry around! we were terrified ours would get stolen but they didnt. the safe key was safe enough hiding in my sock drawer but everything else we would have to carry around. it is best to take the key off of the plastic thing indicating the room number in case someone steals it and breaks into your room. maybe thats a little paranoid, i'm not sure, but it worked for me! -Beach: rocks everywhere! bring beach shoes for the water because otherwise you'll be saying \"ouch\" with every few steps. fish swim around by the shore and are not afraid of people. the beaches get really crowded in the mornings and the sun is strong. i'd suggest wearing SPF 30 on the first day. our first day on the beach, we saw a monkey in one of the trees! all the women are topless so if you dont want your young kids to see that, go somewhere else. also, the people are mostly russian, polish, swedish. not many americans at all. -Shopping: if you exit the riu palace and go to your right, theres a little shopping mall 2 minutes away. they do henna tattoos, sell a lot of cigars, shoes, clothes, etc. Its perfect for buying your friends and family little presents. To your left, there are a few shops but are nothing special. i would say go to the mall. there is something there for everyone. also, that is where you can go to get lighters, sunblock, and bathing suits instead of the resort store where everything is expensive. -Food: buffet was great!!! even the pizza there was great. i never got bored of it because there is so much variety. the lunch buffet is by the beach and breakfast and lunch buffets are by the lobby. all meals are great, especially lunch and dinner. unfortunately, the desserts were a little dissappointing. many of them just didnt have a taste to them at all, but everything else was great. The a la carte restaurants are impossible to get a reservation for the same night. reserve them the day you get to the resort. i went to the japanese one on the 4th day there when i was already used to buffets. we waited 30 minutes for them to take our order and another 30 for them to bring us our food. the room where we ate was tiny, hot, and noisy. the food wasnt great either. -Everything else: overall, it was a great experience. the entertainment at night sometimes went on for a long time and it was very noisy for those that were in their rooms. but the entertainment is pretty funny most of the time, especially if you're a little tipsy. towels are changed every day, bathtub is small but nice. there are only 2 ashtrays in the room. i dont know what else to say! -Be careful: with our keys! i did hear some stories of theft so just hold on to your stuff. also, dont leave your screen door open at all. a wasp got into our room and it just did not want to leave!!! the doors are wooden and heavy, very annoying to open when you're tired.

Any Palace Resorts with Riu is NOT kid friendly and families should really look to the Iberostars for the perfect family vacation. We sat at dinner at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya next to a family of 6 (kids were approx. 5, 9, 13) and when the food was presented by lifting the silver domes, the kids all complained and collectively said YUK and Eew! This was disturbing to us and other guests. You will not find kid friendly food on the menu, this is for a reason. Elegant dining, quiet pool areas to me says adult. I had a talk with the manager of the Riu Palace Riviera Maya and he told me there were trying the kids club to increase business.

A little hectic at the Cancun airport, lots of people trying to help you with your bags, it's best if you find the company (i.e. Apple Travel) you made your travel plans with. The ride to the hotel was uneventful and lasted about 45 minutes to an hour. Upon arriving at the hotel we went straight the reception desk, a gentleman took our bags to the side and found someone to help us, unfortunately the man at the reception desk didn't speak English very well, but we got our point across and so did he. My dad and stepmom made reservations at 2 of the restaurants while my husband ,6 year old daughter, brother, sister and sisters boyfriend went to go check out the lunch buffet at Chiles. Lots to choose from, pizza, hamburgers, french fries, salads, pastas and other more exotic choices. You MUST have the ice cream!!! After lunch which was running late around 4 p.m. we went to sit by the pool, chairs were available but at that time they had run out of towels, this did NOT happen for the rest of the trip, towels, drinks, and food were all plentiful and service was exceptional, people come around all day long asking if they can get you anything. We ate all our breakfasts at the main dining room buffet, wonderful! Eggs, rolls, fruit, juices, meats,made to order omlettes, you can even have a bloody mary with bkfast! Lunches at Chiles everyday, cervezas were flowing freely. We tried two of the specialty restaurants. The Brazilean restaurnat was not that great. Meat on skewers desert, not as good as in the main dining room. The gourmet restaurant was FABULOUS. We took our 6 year old who behaved very well, If you have a child or children who can't sit for a while this would not be the restaurant of choice, it is very quiet and your meal takes a while to be served. We had mussels as an appetizer, scallops and shrimp for a main, some of us had the beef, it was all wonderful and the champagne glasses were refilled often. Desert was also DELICIOUS! The beach is very small at the hotel but you can use the beach at the other RIU palace hotel which is a 5 minute walk, there we went parasailing, jet skiing, each activity is 55 US dollars. I only used the fitness room once, there are only 2 treadmills 1 bike, one recumbant bike and some weight machines, no free weights or other equipment. The weather was perfect each day, we only had rain 1 night and for 15 minutes one afternoon. Our room was cleaned daily and they did a fantastic job, my daughter loved all the towel animals they made and the fridge was always stocked with water and other soft drinks and beer, there is also a separate liquor cabinet above the fridge. The pool area is lovely, swim up bar, lots of chairs, towel shack, infinity pool stationary chaise lounges in a shallow area of the main pool. Umbrellas and shade can be found as well. At night you will find singers, bands, shows and lots of people coming around to offer to get you drinks. We also spent some time in the sports bar, air hockey, pool tables, t.v. some video games and a fridge with snacks. The lobby had plenty of couches and chairs where we also spent some time playing cards and catch phrase. At night there was turn down service with Hershey Kisses left on the bed. The safe in our room was our only issue, very frustrating trying to get it unlocked, no one else had this problem. Another plus..........this is the only time I have traveled outside the US and not had a problem with my stomach, We were all sad to go home, the ride back to the airport was again ,uneventful. The airport was hectic once again, the lines to check our luggage were VERY long but moved fairly quickly. Don't buy any type of drink to bring on the plane, we had to toss out our unopened water and bottle of soda. All and all we had a great time together, lots of laughs, lots of food, lots of sunshine.

It\u2019s truly a beautiful hotel, food was good and service great. There is a large area to lie down at the beach to tan\u2026but very little shade since you have to rely only on the palm trees. There are no umbrellas on the beach, so we found ourselves having to move every few minutes to avoid the sun. Finally, I just grabbed an umbrella from the pool area and took it to the beach. I was very, very disappointed in the lack of a swimming beach area (see pictures!). Apparently, the high tide came in within the past 2 months and washed away all the sandy area to walk into the beach. There were huge algae covered rocks in front of the hotel. They were putting up hundreds of sandbags to prevent the ocean from eroding the beach wall in front of the hotel. There is a small (about 25 yards) area in front of the neighboring hotel to the right of this hotel (about 2 minute walk) where you can swim\u2026of course, this area also was surrounded by humongous sand bags the size of cars. There is also nowhere to stroll along the beach...you are surrounded by hotels and homes whose beaches have also been completely eroded. Also, the water was not as warm as I expected\u2026neither in the ocean nor in the (unheated) pool\u2026you get used to it after a while, but it was a bit cold for the kids.

We had a fantastic holiday at this hotel, many of the visitors were Canadians or Americans and only a few of us Europeans. We were very impressed by the level of service in the Restaurants and the housekeeping. We did leave however with a sour taste in our mouth after a few pesos that we had left lying around was taken from our room. We spoke to the General Manager and was told that they would look into the situation. A bottle of wine (which was already part of the package) was left in our room with no explanation at all. It was more the principal of someone taking something rather than the amount. All the staff treated our little girl very well and she was treated like a little princess, which she is of course in our eyes. If you want to go shopping, there is Playa de Carmen (15 min walk or 5 dollars in taxi), there is the usual souvenir tat and trinkets and some other little boutiques. They also have Starbucks, which is a godsend - you can also get the ferry from here to Cozumel. With the pound being very strong against the dollar, I would advise you to go to Cancun for the day to go shopping. The journey time is only an hour from the bus terminal at Playa de Carmen, take a taxi to La Isla Shopping. It is a shopping village with bar and restaurants, Aquarium (swim with dolphins) and some designer shops. Now here are the bad points: Was told incorrect information regarding booking the Christmas Eve Dinner by reception and hence did not book a table for dinner - was passed from waiter to waiter to see if we could have a table, in the end my husband just sat down and we went to get our meal. The dining room where dinner was served (Don Manolo) could not cope with the amount of people wanting to eat, it was like being in a sardine can. By the time you sat down to have your meal your food was cold. In the end, we could not be bothered to go up again. Management should arrange for the staff to have English lessons as some could not cope with even the basic stuff.

Upon arriving at the hotel we were given the customary welcome drink and were surprised to learn that our rooms were ready at 11:00am. The rooms are beautiful and well maintained. the mini-bar was always well stocked and the room was always cleaned and fresh towels left. We received a call on our first day inquiring as to wether we were happy with our room. A very nice touch I must say and it is true that the beds are hard as rocks but you get used to it after a couple of nights We have travelled to the DR several times and this was our first time to Mexico and also to a RIU. The resort is beautiful and always perfectly maintained. The food was excellent at the main buffet. They had two theme dinners while we were there, one was Caribbean and one was Mexican. They make extra efforts with the theme nights such as ice, butter and watermellon sculptures. We only went to one a-la carte dinner which was the Rodizio. They keep the platter warm at your table with a candle that smells a lot like Citronella which was giving me a head ache so we kept blowing it out. Many people that we talked to loved this restaurant so maybe it was just not for us. After that we prefered to eat outside on the terrace at the main buffet and enjoyed ourselves. The service is wonderful at this resort. When you sit down there are waiters waiting to push your chair in for you and every request no matter how small or large is attended to quickly and with a smile. The one thing I noticed was that not many people were tipping. I thought this was odd as these people work very hard and very long hours. We tipped quite frequently and were thanked every time. Plaza Playacar is a five minute walk up the road for shopping etc or you can walk 25 mins in the other direction (or a $5 cab ride) to Playa del Carmen. If you can manage to beat off the time share sales people it is quite enjoyable to do a little shopping there as well. The ferry to Cozumel is $11.00 and about 40 minutes to get across. Signor Frogs is also on the pier and always looked busy. We went on one tour which was the Fat Cat. A 50ft Catamaran that cruises for an hour and then snorkeling for an hour and then time on a beautiful beach and then another hours cruise back. There was also deep sea fishing off the back so there was something for everyone. It was $85 US for four hours and well worth it. They also provided all snacks, fruit and all the beer and rum punch that you could drink. They were a lot of fun and I would totally recommend it. After seeing the beaches in the DR I must say that the beaches in Mexico are sadly lacking. The storms have eroded the beaches to the point where they are almost non-existant. There are two levels of beach at this resort......the upper and the lower. The upper is beautiul with plenty of room and lots of palm trees for shade. The lower is two steps down and there is not any ocean access as it is all rocks and coral. You can walk about three minutes to The Reef which is the resort next door and swim in at their beach access. Not sure if that is really allowed but we all did it anyway. All in all it was a fabulous vacation and we would return again. RIU Palace is definately a palace and they treat you like royalty. If you want a nice relaxing vacation then this is the place for you. P.S. Say Hi to Zavier in the lobby bar at night. He makes the best white russians and always remembered what we liked.

In order not to repeat too much of what others have written, just the points that stuck out to us: This resort is much more subdued than others, probably due to the fact that it is a RIU Palace, also we found that the AGES were very mixed, there seemed to be quite a lot of people our age (late twenties to mid- thirties), maybe also due to the fact that at least 3 weddings took place while we were there \u2026 GUESTS were international; majority seemed US American, but also lots of Europeans (the weak Dollar = strong Euro buys them a lot over here nowadays.) You\u2019ll see quite some Speedos but not very many top-less women \u2026 ;-) The whole resort feels more HOTEL-LIKE than any other resort we have been to (Paradisus Punta Cana & Coral Marien Puerta Plata, both Dom. Rep.), most likely due to the fact that it\u2019s all in one large U-shaped building, with short distances, not so much tropical landscaping, more palace like fountains, a great European Caf\u00e9 ambience in the courtyard etc. HOTEL ROOMS & BATHROOMS are very nice and well kept, impeccable maid service with \u201cturn down service\u201d with Hershey kisses at night. SERVICE in restaurants and at pool was great, very attentive and fast, no need to tip. We just tipped for extraordinary service plus the maid twice per day (+ bell boy, for room service, driver of airport transportation). I am pregnant and they were almost insulted when you ordered your drinks without alcohol but when I told them why they acted overjoyed and kept congratulating us \u2026 POOL is a lot of fun with the sun loungers and the little table nooks near the swim up bar. It was never a problem finding a chair in the shade or sun no matter what time we showed up. But this pool does not intertwine with tropical landscape like at some resorts. The FOOD is very good, with lots of choices. We ate once at each one of the a la carte restaurants and one night at the buffet \u2013 almost wished we had done that more often, it was great with lots of almost gourmet choices. The gourmet restaurant Sir Oliver was very good, but didn\u2019t seem \u201ctruly\u201d gourmet to us. It was better for example at the Paradisus Punta Cana\u2019s Gourmet Restaurant. We made reservations right on the first day and continued doing that (you can only make two at a time) and didn\u2019t have any problem getting into all restaurants during our week there. The WALK TO 5TH AVE in Playa del Carmen is about 20 min and very nice, although you might want to take a taxi (for $5) during the day, it does get pretty hot \u2026 we felt very safe walking even at night and in the dark. There is quite some police presence on 5th Ave and the Riu is in the gated Playacar zone although anyone can walk in, they just check cars more carefully. It seemed like only other tourists were out walking in Playacar, occasional joggers (tourists too?). The walk leads you by some Mayan ruins, if you follow the foot path on the right at the second set of ruins (coming from the hotel zone going towards 5th Ave) down it comes out at more ruins close to the beach. If you want to save money on the TOURS, check out the travel agency Solatino on 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen, they were $10 per person cheaper for the Tulum Explorer (1/2 day tour for $28) and also considerably cheaper on other trips. Be aware of other offers, some are from time-share companies \u2013 usually the ones trying really hard to get your attention. No one at Solatino chased us down or followed us out when we didn\u2019t buy the trip on our first visit. When we tried to bargain with our Tour Rep at the hotel, he did offer us a special \u201cMexican\u201d price on the all day trip to Tulum and Xel-Ha, but said he couldn\u2019t compete with Solatino and advised us to buy the \u00bd day trip there for that price and confirmed that they are a reputable travel agency. We could always find a COMPUTER at the sports bar (5 stations, one empty one for laptop), although they seemed quite busy. It\u2019s $8 for 1 hour which was just enough for us to check our e-mail almost daily for a week. COMPLAINTS: The BEACH! There is one, but only behind about half of the sea wall and right at the waters edge there are rocks covered with algae = slippery, unsafe to go into the water there and we hardly saw anyone doing it. You can\u2019t walk the beach from there to any of the other resorts, because there is none to the right or the left. You are stuck! That\u2019s what we really disliked most. We loved being able to walk the beach at the other resorts we have been at. You can of course go to any of the other RIU properties, the Playacar is closest or the Palace Mexico, they have a \u201cnormal\u201d beach, but it was pretty packed on the sand and in the water. And it\u2019s not that convenient to have to walk there on the street \u2026. So if a beach is important to you, this resort might not be for you. The central AIR-CONDITIONING seemed to be turned off between 3 \u2013 6 am in our room. We woke up several nights in a row around that time really hot, turned our air further down, without any effect. However it would always be cool when we went to bed and when we woke up in the morning (around 12 - 1 am and about 8 am). We asked at the front desk, they said it\u2019s only turned of in the common areas, promised to send someone to look at our room, nothing happened. We were on the top floor, that probably didn\u2019t help. The ANIMATION TEAM is not as active or obnoxious as at some other resorts (where they might not leave you alone until you agree to enter the beer drinking contest \u2026), BUT they are also hard to find unless they have a scheduled activity right then and there. There is no central location where to find them and you might be just out of luck. They don\u2019t have any waterballs you can borrow, there is just one table tennis table out on the beach which seemed to be either occupied when we wanted to play or we couldn\u2019t find anyone to provide us with rackets and a ball (much better e.g. at the Coral Marien in Puerta Plata). They only play louder music at the bar during the scheduled activities like ballroom dancing or water aerobics (both in the pool), it is pretty quiet otherwise. My suitcase didn\u2019t make it there the first day and we didn\u2019t get to the resort after many flight diversions until 10.45 pm, I had packed my toiletries (inc. toothbrush) in the check in luggage because of the new restrictions \u2013 well, I thought they would have a toothbrush for me at the front desk possibly \u2013 no chance, only at the gift store which was already closed then.

In reading the reviews, I see people complaining about this not living up to the price. That is totally ridiculous. One cannot expect total luxury at an all inclusive resort charging 1000 dollars a week. Anyone expecting total luxury should expect to pay A LOT more in 2006 than this place charges. This was as much as you can get for the price, and quite comfordable. Luxury is the Amanpurri in Phuket, Thailand- try about $750 a night- room only... Mexico is about laid back fun and great weather, and the Riu delivers. Also, for the record, I am not a fun of all inclusives. I prefer independant travel and feel the all inclusive robs you of the cultural experience of visiting foreign countries, but it was a group trip, I relented, and fully enjoyed myself. We stayed at the Riu Riviera for 5 days on a family reunion/holiday. The resort was way more than adequate for our needs. The food was excellent- high quality, good preperation and sufficient variety. Only ate at the Brazilian restaurant, buffet the other nights. It was just better for our group that contained three vegetarians. We also rolled into town for a meal. Totally worth it and highly recommended. The drinks were what I would expect from a top end all inclusive, that is to say anyone will get sick of call brands and Corona in a few days. But, just as I say that, i went on a huge bender the last night in the sports bar, and the cold coronas went down great, so there you go... Everything was served on time and with a smile. The staff was really great, but we did tip well. They totally deserve it. These people work 6 days a week, 12 hours a day at showing us a good time-- a few bucks here and there goes a long way towards helping them support their families and insuring promt service. Regardless, tips or no tips, service was more than adequate. Our room was impecably clean and well apointed, once again, you want luxury and romance, try another spot, but for a clean attractive and comfordable room, look no further. I mean really, the in room liquor dispenser says it all. this place is designed for fun, not hard core romance and indulgence. Oh yeah, room service was pretty horrible, as expected. four choices, all pretty bad. Beach was bad, but that is not the resorts fault. I understand there is a dredging vessel in Cancun that is coming down in January to repair the beaches damaged by hurricanes. There is a dive operation at the resort. they can help you plan trips if you are a diver. Scuba Caribe, good reputable Dive operation, convenient too. If you are a diver, i recommend a day in the Cenotes. Totally unique and beautiful. DO NOT book excursions in the lobby. The concession in the lobby will rip you off. Go across the street to the Plaza Playacar or into town to compare excursion prices. You will save 20%. Funjet is a rip off. Though our trip to Xel-HA and Tulum was fun, we overpaid because we booked it in the lobby. Once again, NOT the hotel's fault. In summary, i thought the riu was a good value, was incredibly clean, great food, great service, comfordable, and close to town. You do not feel trapped at your resort. It is great for groups and families, but couples seeking a romantic hide-away should look elsewhere.

Last year we stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico for one week by comparison. On the plus side: a. The Riviera Maya is fancier with a very large Lobby, nice bar, beautiful courtyard and pool. b. The rooms were spacious and clean with nice balconies. The air conditioning was quiet and comfortable. There are three maid services each day: cleaning, towel check, turn down the beds. The bottled water was dutifully replenished each day. c. Excellent wait staff. Excellent service staff. We received two calls each week asking if we were satisfied with our room. A problem with our shower fixture was quickly repaired. The reception desk staff were very helpful and polite. They were also invaluable in helping us with taxis, currency exchange and local travel advice. c. The food at the buffet was quite good each day. The three specialty restaurants we visited were all quite enjoyable. On the down side: a. The mixed drinks were not very good. We are convinced ALL the liquor is watered down. Although internationally known brands are available, you must ask for them each time or you will receive local inferior stock. The wine was not watered down. The Chilean Cabernet and the Merlot were very good. The Corona beer was fine. b. There is no beach!! That is, there is no sand at the water's edge. If you want to go into the ocean, you must walk down to the Palace Mexico and use their beach (which is beautiful). This was unexpected and very disappointing. Next year we will stay at the Mexico to make sure we have a proper beach. c. No face cloths in the bathroom. Shabby beach towels. d. All the doors to the rooms slam shut! Wham! The doors are heavy and the closer pumps are set much too strongly. Believe me, it's a real surprise when your neighbor returns at 12:30am and his door slams shut! e. The room's walls and ceilings are not well insulated at all. You hear much more than you want to! The first week we could hear children running above us and toys dropping on the floor. The second week there were no children above us but we could clearly hear and feel much more alarming sounds from the adults. Also, we could clearly hear the TV in the next room whenever it was on. We don't recall having this problem at the Mexico. Keep it in mind. Will we return?

Traveling without our husbands we were a bit nervous. However, we never had any problems, even leaving the resort to do some shopping. We chose not to walk at night (took cabs - $5 to shopping area) but did enjoy walking to the shopping area during daylight (about 20 minutes). The hotel ~ food, beach, pool & room: FOOD: We never dined in the reservations only restaurants on property. It was easier for us to eat at Don Manolos (w/out reservations). The food was good. Lots of variety. Even the meats we decent. We aren't picky eaters though. They had fries and pizza for kids. The ice cream was the best though! The restaurant by the pool was also good. We ordered room service a couple of times. Nothing fancy. They have nachos on the menu and a couple other snack type things. The nachos were ok. Not very authentic tasting, but did the trick when you had the munchies. Beach: It was good for our girls to play on. I was disappointed that the girls couldn't play in the water off the beach though. There is a fence so you either play above it in the sand, or walk down to the tiny beach/water area. There just wasn't any place to put lounge chairs near the water. Pool: Freezing. Way too cold. The 3 year old did good with floaties - but my 2 year old couldn't get in with out me. Hard to relax with it not being kid friendly. Now there is a shallow area where the water chairs are, but it does drop off to deep water. There is a kiddie pool area but it smelled like wet cat so we didn't let them play there. Room: We booked a standard room. If a view is important to you, be sure to pay the extra $$. Our view was of a roof. Not very pretty. We didn't really care though, but if I were traveling with my hubby I would like a nicer view. We never sat on the balcony, because there was really nothing to look at. Beds are hard, but I brought one of those egg crate mattress thingies. That did the trick. The room is a good size and VERY clean. The maids do a great job. We had to remind them daily for towels though and never got wash clothes... The drinks were always good. We aren't heavy drinkers, but found they were never watered down. Infact, I had to throw away a Pina Coloda twice because it was too strong! Location is good. We booked through Worry Free and had the airport transfers included. Our hotel was the first stop to be dropped off. When it was time to go back to the airport, we were the last to be picked up. I think this is a good place to get away with a friend. It's not really my cup of tea for a romantic getaway though. Lots of families and kids - which was great for this trip. I would have rated higher if the pool were more kid friendly for younger travelers. Also the standard rooms have lousy views (unless you pay for an upgrade, or get lucky with one on arrival). I just want to note that incase a view is important to you. Some resorts have good standard views. Unless you think rooftops are pretty, pay extra here! I also like to see the ocean when staying a beachfront resort. There aren't many rooms at this resort that have that.

I consulted the reviews extensively before leaving so I thought I'd submit my own. Generally - This hotel is absolutely beautiful. Ceramic tile, marble, gorgeous wood trimming and lovely decor. The layout is perfect. The transition from the hotel/ courtyard to the pool to the beach is open and easy and breathtaking. The staff work tirelessy to ensure that every surface is always clean. (And they always stop what they're doing to say \"hola\" with a huge smile). Rooms - We were fortunate to get a couryard room (2104) - we could see everything - ocean, pool the main building and all the interesting people walking by. The layout was great. Lots of room to hang up clothes and put them away so we didn't have to look at our suitcases all week. Our room was done 2X a day - more thoroughly during the day with turn down service at night. Fridge stocked daily and when we ran out of vodka, it was replaced within 15 minutes of our call to the front desk. We even got a few towels critters throughout the week!! Service - Unbelievable. Every bartender, front desk person, restaurant staff member was friendly and accomodating. And I can't even begin to imagine how many people are employed at the resort to make it function so smoothly. There were employees everywhere!! Amazing. Pool - very pretty - great layout - nice pool bar. I'm not a pool person when I'm in the Caribbean, so we didn't hang out there - but from what I could see - tonz of chairs!! Beach - okay - lets get this straight. There is a very large upper beach area with tons of trees on the sides and an open area in the middle. Huge - open - beautiful with a wonderful view of the sea. It is the widest and most beautiful along the playacar area. No crowding and no shortage of chairs - probably two for every person and the resort was full. BUT - there is NO gradual sand entry into the ocean. It has been washed away at this resort and at a number of others down the coastline - eg. there were palapas at the resort two down that were basically in the ocean where the beach once was. Even Royal Hideaway were crammed in like sardines on what little beach there was in front of that hotel. As you work your way down, the beaches are less eroded and easy to access. What we did was swim at either the little beach to the left or the little beach to the right of the hotel. Or we took a nice long walk down to a sandier area. Not ideal - but we made the best of it. No question that the beach in front of Riu Palace Mexico has more sand access - but the beach was crammed with chairs and I didn't think that the transition from hotel to pool to beach was as pretty or easy. (But this resort is also beautiful!!) In my view the beach down this entire strip of hotels cannot compete with Turks and Caicos, Paradise Island or Punta Cana - but every place is different and we thoroughly enjoyed the area. Food - breakfast and lunch buffets were great. Loved eating lunch upstairs at Chilis and looking out at the beautiful sea. Variety was great. Always fresh and service was good. The restaurants were good, for the most part. Gourmet was the best (order the seafood entree - shrimps and scallops). Japanese was nice and we had a great steak at Chili's - order the rib-eye meduim rare - nice grillled flavour). The Mexican restaurant was terrible. Service and food were bad for us. Maybe it was a bad night. We skipped our reservation at the Brazilian and had dinner in Playa del Carmen. Absolutely fabulous meal - appetizer, salad and fresh seafood dishes prepared at the table, two cervesas each and our bill was $50 u.s.!! Hard to beat that - with some lovely live Mexican music in the background!! We only had dinner at the buffet once and it was good. Spa/ gym - used the gym twice - very clean and well air conditioned. Equipment in good shape for a busy resort. Didn't use the spa but it looked beautiful. Overall - we had a great week. Only one disappointing meal out of 21!! Loved walking into Playa and enjoying the local scene - bars, local music etc. Felt very safe at all times. Did one excursion to ruins, a sink hole and a Mayan village. Very cool. Great internet access in the sports bar - kept in touch with our kids that way.

First of all, the hotel is expensive and, thus, needs to live up to the standard of those prices to be worth what you are charging. I have worked for Marriott International and the Four Seasons so I believe I know what price versus quality is all about in a hotel. Our room (#1011) had a view of about ten meters of grass and the back of the next building. We requested to move but were told there was nothing available. I find that difficult to believe. Food. Although the buffets were adequate, they certainly were not excellent and, again, at these prices we expected excellent. When we attempted to reserve a table for Friday evening we were told everything was full. This was @ 2:30 in the afternoon. You must reconsider the math. Perhaps you need more seatings at these theme restaurants but I don't understand how I can utilize the benefits of this luxury resort if I can't even get a table at a restaurant. Did you know that we were part of a wedding group that booked 31 rooms at the hotel? That's a significant amount and, yet, it does not appear that extra efforts were made to accommodate us (i.e., rooms with views). There was no information when we checked in regarding the wedding such as early gatherings, rehearsal dinner and so. This might sound petty, but with everything else I feel it needs stating. When housekeeping cleans my room and takes the open bars of soap, I think it's only obvious to replace them with new soap. No, instead our soap was taken and none was replaced. Also, our in-room liquor dispenser was never refilled, even though I asked three different hotel employees to do so. And, is there a definitive policy on gratuities because many of your bar staff were accepting tips. Mr. Ponnette, I want to say that Oscar and Robert at the front desk did the best they could to appease my wife and I but the overall experience (again, for the price) was very poor. I would like to hear what you have to say. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the travel agent that arranged this wedding trip.

The new Palace has a more spacious feel in common areas than the Riu Palace Mexico (RPMexico). Either way, it continued to provide the same high quality service received on previous visits. Wait staff were great. Elevia was a dear at breakfast. Luciano and Nicholas made lunch enjoyable and ensured our glasses were always filled. We even met Tino (Faustino) back from Cabo San Lucas. He started as a bartender at Yucatan, moved to RPMexico, then on the Cabo San Lucas. We have watched his career grow in his time at the Resorts and glad to see he is doing so well. Stepahnie (orignally Public Relations rep at RPMexico during Wilma fiasco) is now Assistant Manager at RPRM. I have read numerous reports that state \"the beach is too small\". The beach is fine. It is protected by bulkhead with an ocean beach in front. Why anyone thinks the beach in front of the poolbar is not ocean front, I haven't figured out. A gentleman from Holland and I agreed the pool and beach were great. Shade is provided by palms and it does move with the sun. My husband and I had the luxury of moving our lounges to follow the shade as the sun moved on the horizon. I'd give the beach and pool a 10. Another complaint has been the lack of a beach bar. Considering the depth of the beach and the pool bar location, a beach bar is unnecessary. I have stayed at Riu Palace Mexico three times and walking to the beach bar is actually further than travel to the pool bar on RPRM. Pool bar service another 10. The pool is fantastic. The view of the ocean is always fun. Food has changed. We used to love the buffet. The variety was sufficient to satisfy almost every day of the stay. The buffet is somewhat smaller than at RPMexico, but it does have five fully staffed ala carte restaurants you can chose from for dinner. Breakfast and lunch was great. Dinner at the ala carte restaurants the only controlled portion menu. I spent one day walking from the beach to Chili's \"grazing\" on fish, beef, and mussels. Fruit always topped off the meal or filled the munching instinct. For those who may be interested, RPRM does have a piano bar and Cristobal does a good job playing music while few listen. The sad part is the room is so large if you're not looking for him, you may miss him. He'll take requests and play it if he has it available. Nice to see. Resort has removed the chapel at RPMexico and replaced it with a sports bar. Strangely, it always seemed to have people in it so I guess there is a need. Not one of my highlights. Only trip was with Iguana Boats Tour to Ek Balam and Rios Largartos. If you don't mind riding for four hours to get to the river, it's a great trip. We truly enjoyed seeing American crocodiles and birds (eagles, hurons, pelicans, and most importantly pink flamingos, real ones) in the wild, riding in the boats, eating a delicious fish lunch in a sleepy fishing village (truly) and seeing the \"new\" ruins of Ek Balam. If anyone would like more info, let me know. I thought it was great. Only major inconvenience that seems to be common complaint right now was the key cards and readers used for room. It took four sets of key cards and a change to the reader before we got into our room easily. We also got an individual tutoring by a maintenance person who taught us the \"secret handshake\". When brought up to hotel staff, the problem was acknowledged and is being pursued. Not much more I can say about that. We had a great time. We loved our courtyard room and view of the Ocean.

We would definitely go back and couldn't understand why the resort didn't have better reviews on Trip Advisor than it did. Property: The hotel was very beautiful and in our opinion the most beautiful of all the 5 Riu's in the area including the Palace Mexico. Everything was brand new and the decor was done much better. It had a clean look and feel overall from the lobby to the courtyard area, the pool and beach. Loved the layout. Service: We have absolutely no complaints about this. We were tended to each and every time it was required and we felt the staff were sincere in their friendliness and willingness to help. In fact, we felt that way about the locals in general. Some times were busier than others for the staff in which case it was understandable that there would be a delay (for example: clearing the table or taking a drink order at Chili's) but this happened twice in a week and was quickly rectified when brought to their attention. The wait staff at the restaurants were awesome and maid service as well as those stocking the bar did a great job. Room: My husband and I slept fine on the firm mattress but I can understand why this type of mattress would be something bothersome for people. The layout of the room was great, had a courtyard view. The door was a little hard to open, as someone wrote about previously, there is a trick to it. The jacuzzi worked fine. The only BUT in this whole review is watch out for mold in the room. It is unbelievably humid at the resort so this is an unfortunate thing that may happen. The cleaning staff does their best to keep on top of it but this should be mentioned to management. Beach and Pool: Very clean beach and no problems finding a place to park. The pool was also very nice and there were more people here than on the beach but we never had a problem finding spots. The pool bar was great and made the best drinks compared to the other bars. The water at the beach was a gorgeous turquoise although it can be rocky at parts. Food: We ate at the Brazilian (great for meat lovers), Mexican and Japanese restaurants, Sir Oliver's, Chili's and Don Manolo. Sir Oliver's was our favourite. Crab bisque and the seafood entree with scallop and shrimp were delish. Mexican was our least favourite but we expected a lot from them. All the food was prepared well, tasted good and was good quality. We had no issues with the food and the only time we needed Pepto Bismol was when we ate a taco we got in town. However, if you are looking to get the same type of food you would get at a top restaurant in North America, you won't get it. This is what I think people (who wrote bad reviews about the food) were expecting. You will have a good selection of nice meals. All in all: We loved it. People were great. We felt safe. There's some good shopping in Playa del Carmen (20-25 minutes walk) and in the Playacar Shopping Centre (under 10 minutes walk).

My husband and I went with his parents to celebrate our 3 years anniversary. We stayed Oct. 30-Nov. 7. Also, sorry this is so long, but full of our insightful tips and info... If there was one thing that could have been better it would be the weather - it was rainy/cloudy about 60% of the time. And it is hurricane season, (so what did we expect?) but I wish it was a tad sunnier or we got luckier - there was a few storms that took a couple days to subside. If I could change one thing it would be to pay the higher price and go during the best weather (March/April), then we would\u2019ve definitely gotten our money's worth. It was frustrating going out to the pool getting all your gear and sunblock on and then everyone running in all frantic because of the pouring rain. Your vacation is either mostly inside or in your room if you go during this time - honestly....Be aware of the weather!! It was muggy and wet it seemed like the whole time. I too am one of those people that read tripadvisor.com frantically and wanted to go to the best place in Playa del Carmen. We had already been to Cancun twice and never here, so we decided to try it out. If you are wondering about whether or not to go to the other Rius - this is by far the best one and you will pay for it. It is GORGEOUS and like a palace when you see it. The other Riu's are just a few blocks down the street and nothing like the Riu Palace Riviera Maya in terms of cleanliness, bars, ambience, class, style, decorating...looked to us like our hotel was by far better than the others. We walked over to the Riu Tequila because we heard they had a good sports bar and we were pretty disappointed, they do not. Here are some first tips that I want to advise everyone, that will definitely make your trip better. 1. Figure out your ground transportation! We booked out stay directly through Riu and the transportation is included with them. BUT \u2013 they fail to give you any further information on getting the transportation organized. You are to email them directly and let them know your flight information so they can have someone picking you up. We did that thinking that everything was fine and when we got to the Cancun airport it was a mess. You almost feel like a celebrity because so many people are wanting to give you rides, sell you tours, talk to you, bring you over here, etc. etc\u2026The only information about our transportation was in small fine print on our email reservation and it was provided by a company called Hotel Beds (don\u2019t ask me what kind of name this is\u2026??) So of course nobody knows who Hotel Beds is or where they are located and we are directed to an Information Desk \u2013 which is not an information desk, but a lady trying to sell us a trip and golf. Great. Do not stop by the Information desk on the left after baggage claim. So, we eventually walk through the madness and find a sign around the corner called Hotel Beds\u2026(yea right nobody knew where it was\u2026). They did not have any of our information and the only reason we got a ride to the Riu was because I showed him our email reservation from the hotel where it said Hotel Beds reallllly small. Good, got a ride. Our ride was awful! We were in a van with two other couples and had to drop them off on the way. Okay, no big deal\u2026at first. We turn into some road off the highway and go down, seriously, the worst road I have ever driven on in my life. Personally, I would have never even taken a 4-wheeler through this road and we took this van. I was so scared and my husband almost told him to not take us down this road and to stop. We turned in and it was sooo muddy and big big deep potholes everywhere full of mud and water. There was zero signage as to where we were going and no road lights or anything. We had no idea where we were going. It was all mud too, no pavement. The road should have only been taken us less then 5 minutes to drop these people off, but it took us 45 min. there and back . Our driver drove so slow through this road, inched through these potholes and was all over the road trying to avoid everything, which did not work because the entire road was so bad \u2013 mind you it was also dark, we were in the middle of the jungle and ready to get to our destination. I couldn\u2019t believe it. This hotel If you are staying there, don't. When we finally got to this hotel these poor people got out and I think they were pretty embarrassed about booking this place already and about ready to cry. Anyways, this was how our trip started\u2026.then the entire trip the door of the van isn\u2019t shut and is clanging and banging the whole hour drive. It was very irritating and loud. Our driver made no effort to get out of the van or pull over to fix it. So, it was definitely a relief to get to the Riu. My in-laws were there with a melted frozen margaritas waiting for us. Oh and before I forget\u2026.about your transportation. There are \u201cHotel Beds\u201d representatives in the hotel throughout the week and when you get there they want you to come downstairs and meet with them. Well, we were so frustrated, the last thing we wanted to do was sit and talk to these people\u2026.and my in-laws said you didn\u2019t have to because all they do is try and sell you stuff. They were right\u2026we saw so many couples sitting with travel agencies and the \u201cHotel Beds\u201d people trying to sell them stuff and they were all looking pissed. You don\u2019t have to do this! Just find a representative the day before you leave and arrange your transportation to go home and don\u2019t even sit down on the couch! This is something else they fail to tell you\u2026if you don\u2019t arrange your transportation to leave who knows what happens. Nobody told us this. My in-laws left a day early and had already arranged to have a taxi take them to the airport because they didn\u2019t want to deal with the Hotel Beds people\u2026.but just to be curious we asked them if they have transportation anyways and they said no because they didn\u2019t arrange it the day before\u2026okay, that would have been nice to know..... 2. Tip the resort employees. These people all work very hard and the resort has 5-star service. Honestly, if you want the best service though, give these hard working people 20 pesos and watch the difference. You will get better drinks, better alcohol, better room service, everything if you just tip. I understand that this is an All-Inclusive and in your mind you have already paid for your trip, but these people make barely $60 or less usd a week and they work their tails off. They only get one day off a week and usually work 10-12 hour shifts! Most of them live far from the resort so they have to figure out their transportation as well. I just think it\u2019s good etiquette and you will feel better knowing that you are helping them out. We tipped our bartenders usually about 20 pesos ($2 usd) for every couple/few rounds and our room service $5-10 every couple days. At breakfast and lunch about $2-4 and at dinner $5-10. 3. Do not get suckered into going to those timeshare or resort option buying seminars. I won\u2019t go all into this because it would take me forever to vent, but we ended up going into a shop on Fifth Ave. that sold tours and he gave us a great deal on fishing and golf for our family if we attended a 45 min. seminar to buy a timeshare. We ended up saving about $500 overall on the whole thing, so we thought, \u201cNo big deal it\u2019ll be worth it and we would never buy one anyways\u2026.\u201d Let\u2019s just do this, go on our trip and golf and it\u2019s raining anyways. Well, the entire thing was a joke and they were the most pressuring people I\u2019ve ever met in my life and the majority of them were Americans! It was crazy \u2013 do not go to a Mayan Resorts seminar or even go near these people. We almost didn\u2019t get our fishing and golf that we were promised and paid for and they lied so many times. They said 7 minute ride \u2013 it was 30 minutes. They said 5 hour deep sea fishing trip \u2013 it was not deep sea fishing and we caught two small barracudas and ended it early\u2026they said 45 min. presentation, it was 3 hours. They said 18-hole Jack Nicklaus golf course\u2026par 3 course Jack Nicklaus course (maybe not...?) and they failed to pay for transportation home which was promised. We are going to find people responsible for this company and are writing a big long letter to them, but otherwise steer clear! The only good thing about it was that we saved a lot of money, learned our lesson and it was raining that day so we didn\u2019t have any major plans. My father-in-law gets seasick anyways and we had already golfed at a better 18-hole course the day before. 4. Definitely go into Playa del Carmen downtown and check out Fifth Ave. Some people say that you shouldn\u2019t leave the resort, but I think you definitely should otherwise you might get bored and it\u2019s so worth it. There are so many cute and trendy restaurants and shopping on Fifth Ave. It is safe and a neat experience. We highly recommend doing this during the day and night. It is so neat to see all the people walking and to see how this city is trying to make it work. They are doing a great job down here and I look forward to coming back and even seeing more and how it will be improved. We watched football at a great Sports bar on Sunday and Monday night called EndZone (EZ) Sports bar ([--]) and also ate at Casa Agua and Playasia. Playasia is a part of the BlueParrot Hotel and had the best atmosphere we have ever seen in a restaurant. They had a mix of everything and sushi. We love sushi and didn\u2019t see any other sushi restaurants except this one. We ate at Casa Agua and it was great\u2026the food and drinks were average, but the service was awesome. We had the best waiter and he gave us a free drink and dessert because we were celebrating our 3-year anniversary. They have awesome upstairs dining where you can overlook Fifth Ave. I will highlight some areas of the resort now. BEACH: The beach is great, but it\u2019s setup a little ackward and it\u2019s kind of hard to describe and I never understood until I got there. They don\u2019t have a big beach area that you can run from and into the water\u2026it\u2019s divided by a big concrete sea wall ? I don\u2019t know if that is what it\u2019s called, but there is an extremely large area of sand with the palm trees for laying out on and then closer to the ocean it is cut off by a fence on top of a wall to look over. (Like you are on top of the retaining wall looking down at the water\u2026) You go down a set of stairs on the right and then there is a teeny beach (you don\u2019t lay on this one) and you swim into the ocean. They do this because of the high and low tide I think. There was one day where we had a red flag and nobody could go swimming because the water was right next to the wall and the waves were rough. Then on the left side of the beach you can lay more close to the water, (the wall fades) but there are rocks and you don\u2019t swim there, but you can lay on chairs there. I think the whole setup is great because the area where there is sand allows people just to look over the fence at the ocean and swimmers and there are some people playing soccer with their kids (we only saw this once) or this way you have a nice open view of the gorgeous water. The beach/sand area is so huge, there are an abundance of chairs and areas for privacy and sun \u2013 it\u2019s overwhelming. You will always find a place to lay out or even be close to the water to hear the waves. It\u2019s gorgeous. If you are into a beach where it runs straight into the ocean, this is not it\u2026.but it\u2019s is essentially the same thing once you get past the wall. I hope this gives you an idea of what it\u2019s like. KIDS vs. TEENAGERS: There are some kids around, but they are not bad at all. They are all very cute too and their parents are watching them like hawks too. It was cute to see some of the kids running around playing, but they were never a distration. There are some teenagers, but they were all with their parents...there was a family though I think from Brazil and their kids were drinking, wearing g-string bikinis..these girls were like 14!! I coudln't believe it...maybe that is the way it is there... FOOD: This is like a food marathon resort. There is SO much food it\u2019s overwhelming and after you leave you will have gained 10 pounds (or at least it feels like it now\u2026). They display the food so beautifully and some nights they make some serious food sculptures that were the best I've ever seen in my life. The resort offers a buffet for breakfast, lunch (at Chili's) and dinner and then 5 or so various restaurants to dine at night. There was a Japanese, Brazilian, Mexican, Gourmet and Steakhouse restaurant (I think that was all of them). We never ate at the Gourment (Sir Oliver\u2019s), but our favorite was the Steakhouse. Otherwise, personally we did not think the restaurants were that good. We are avid sushi eaters and the place of sushi they give is is \"okay\"...for Mexico. Otherwise, we didn't really LOVE anything at the restaurants. We like the buffet better... Most of the restaurants have food where some of it, I have no idea what it is\u2026the items are so far off of what we would normally eat in the US. The Mexican is not really Mexican food (I am from New Mexico and we have the best Mexican food) \u2013 the closest thing to Mexican that we saw was the \u201cburritas\u201d, which were only bean and the guacamole and pico that we got from the salad bar. They did have a chalupa type tostada that was more Mexican that tasted pretty good. Otherwise, our favorite was the buffets they offered. There is so much food and it is all presented so well. I am not usually a picky eater, but some of the food is bland and not much flavor. I think that is how it is though in most of these all-inclusive resorts. There are some things that you can find that taste really good, but otherwise it seems they fail to add sugar or spices to their food. I guess it\u2019s just a matter of experiencing it and finding what you like best. My favorite was the ice cream \u2013 they have better ice cream than I have ever tasted here in the states! But, their desserts are SO bland. The guacamole is great (with added salt) and their pico de gallo. Excellent coffee and cappuchinos after dinner were awesome. They have great mimosas and chips too\u2026 SERVICE: The service everywhere is phenomenal. I was really overwhelmed and how prompt the service was and how friendly all the staff was. They were all very accommodating and would definitely go out of their way to make your stay perfect. We asked for a bottle of champagne and orange juice (I love champagne) sent to our room for our anniversary and they were more than willing to do that. We also called ahead and had the head chef make a cake for my husband for his birthday and after dinner they all brought it out and sang Happy Birthday to him. It was great! They are quick to get you water, coffee, your dirty plate, open your chair, place your napkin on your lap, get you another drink, anything. If you really want service that includes special treatment definitely tip. But\u2026if you are ordering drink after drink or your waiter/waitress fails to speed up your order or come around often, maybe it\u2019s because you don\u2019t tip. Really. We never ordered room service though, so I can\u2019t comment on how well that was. SPA/GYM: My mother-in-law and I went and got facials and they were awesome! Approx. $90-100 each for 1 hour. We were able to get them at the same time, in the same room and they were wonderful. I even fell asleep...don't ask me how and this has never happened before. The hot tub and jacuzzi's where in the spa too. All the spa services are not included, so everything you must pay for...(except the sauna and hot tub). My husband and I love to exercise and we visited the gym once this entire trip. They have decent equipment, but nothing like what we have here. A few treadmills, stairclimber, two bikes and an elliptical trainer. It's not the best equipment and kind of ackward to use....plus we want exercise from walking and shopping or swimming. They have weight machines and some mats to stretch. ROOM: The room was beautiful. All over the halls and rooms there is dark cherry wood doors, bed, paneling, furnishings and marble tile floor. It\u2019s actually pretty amazing they have all this wood everywhere with how humid it is. The minibar was stocked with drinks, except bottled water - we did have to ask for it and they gave it to us the rest of the week. There are rooms that face the outside hotel and those that face the courtyard. My in-laws had an outside view, but the next night upgraded to a courtyard room. We had been given an outside view room, but decided to stay there because it was more private. When you have an inside room you have to listen to all the noise at night at the discoclub and there is more going on. They said that there was a lot of noise that you can hear at night and they were even in the middle area\u2026I\u2019m sure if you are at the end closer to the pool it\u2019s not as loud. We also wanted a king bed, but were given two double beds pushed together. At first we were going to change, but actually liked it. We have a queen at home (with a dog), so we were used to being more cramped and it was nice to have that space on our vacation \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t like sleeping together, but this was a change of pace for us to have our own extra space. And we cuddled sometimes\u2026 We tipped our room service and always got two decorated animals and they cleaned everything so well. We only had one bad smelling pillow (??) and they took it away immediately. Our keys didn\u2019t work once either because I think they checked out our parents on accident and they fixed it right away. The bathroom is huge and everything was nice, but be careful of the shower because it is slippery and not very long. On my first night the water temp changed real fast and I stepped back and slipped. I fell back and hit my elbow so hard on the marble tub. I had a big bruised hurting elbow the rest of the trip. Our bathtub was short and it raises up if you take a step back, so be careful\u2026.ugh\u2026 Our view wasn\u2019t bad on the outside, it faced another hotel (The Reef) and it was pretty\u2026we had a teeny view of the ocean far away, but it was fine for us, we didn't spend any time on the balcony anyways. The A/C worked great too. The only complaint was that the beds are very hard\u2026TIP: You can ask the front desk for those egg crate foam pads and if they have any they will put them under you sheets\u2026it definitely made it much better. POOL: The pool was excellent \u2013 there are three different pools connected and on each side there are little tile beds to lay on where you are half in and half out of the water. One pool is above the others that so pretty, it looks like it runs into the ocean\u2026then below is the big pool and the side of that are the tile beds, and then the last pool where they have inlets with a pool booth and table (so neat), jacuzzi inlets, and then the pool bar. I thought it was perfect. The sides where there was those tile beds half in and out of water wasn\u2019t very private though because there was a lot of people sitting on them mingling and drinking. (Which is fine sometimes, but it\u2019s nice to have some space and peace sometimes\u2026) If the weather is nice expect all the lounge chairs to be taken that are closest to the pool. There will be more chairs available, but usually we had to go looking for them and they were 3 rows of lounge chairs back. Twice we got some chairs close to the pool and that was nice. We played water volleyball once and I swam around the most. There are many people that go to these resorts seriously just to marathon read and layout and most of them have such bad sun damage. They are the ones that claim their lounge chairs early and all day. The pool bar (Daiquiri) was the best bar by far. All the bartenders are having fun and will give everyone shots. In a matter of 20 min. once we had 4 shots and 3 awesome strong drinks (we also tipped) and were feeling pretty good. The best bartender is little Juan \u2013 he will dance for you, have fun, get you anything you need. He also speaks good English and tries to learn more. The bartenders make the most money in the pool bar, so they enjoy working there best\u2026(little secret I discovered). Sometimes the animation group got a little annoying, but they are just trying to get people involved and having fun. They play house music every now and again and want everyone to get into it. They are dancing, wear funny costumes to start a dance on the beach, throw each other into the pool and play games. BARS: Well, there are like 5 bars in the resort, but don\u2019t expect them to be the \u201chappening fun bar\u201d. We are in our late 20\u2019s, early 30\u2019s and were looking for more of a fun bar and were pretty disappointed at the club/bars here at the Riu. We never really spent much time at the discoclub or that bar because it looked very cheesy\u2026there was some shows and karaoke, but it didn\u2019t look fun so we never went back. There were some people dancing, but just not our style or age. The best bar was the pool bar to us, they had more fun and all of us were having a good time getting to know each other. There was a sportsbar in the main lobby, but that is not even really a sports bar. To play any of the games it\u2019s pretty expensive \u2013 something like $4. They have the internet in there, so we were in there usually everyday just to use the internet real quick. They have pool, games, snacks and annoying air hockey. When anyone would start to play this we would leave as soon as we could because it was so loud and you couldn\u2019t even hear each other talk. They need to take out this game, seriously. This is not even remotely close to a sports bar, it\u2019s just another bar at the resort where they hang up some jerseys. They had no idea when American Football came on and didn\u2019t even have soccer games going. We are big football/fantasy football fans and ended up going into the town to watch football at EZ Sportsbar. Much better and the owner is great! There is a bar in the lobby which was pleasant and so cute, we enjoyed sitting in there a couple times to get a drink as we passed or to wait for our dinner reservations. The views by the windows are great to look over the courtyard. Definitely check out the Parrot Club, Senor Frogs downtown if you are looking for a club/dance type bar\u2026we are not big dancers either, but it was a cool place to hang out. There are a few more fun bars downtown though \u2013 much better than the Riu for entertainment and it\u2019s only a $5 cab ride. Everyone says you can walk into the town\u2026yes, maybe during the day, but do not walk at night\u2026it is too far and sometimes we weren\u2019t even sure exactly where we were. SHOPPING: You have to go down to Fifth Ave for shopping or two blocks down from the hotel (opposite from the town) there is a little shopping center called Playa Plaza. I didn't even know it was there until 5 days of being there! It was cute and we bought a lot of stuff there. WATERSPORTS: The watersports they offered were okay, they definitely didn\u2019t go out of their way to promote them\u2026and I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t get paid and have to work. It is part of the all-inclusive plan. If the weather was better we would have tried it all\u2026.you have to pay extra for certain things like the banana boat, scuba diving, jet skis and someone with you when you sail. We ended up kayaking and that was fun and got some boogieboards to float around on. I think that you should definitely try it all though, the sailing, bicycle boats, kayaking, scuba, snorkeling\u2026We were going to sail, but didn\u2019t really know how and saw a sailboat overturned and got scared\u2026haha Otherwise, this is an excellent hotel! I wish we honestly didn\u2019t stay as long as we did, 8 nights, 9 days\u2026we were so ready to come home and be in America. I enjoy the culture differences, but got to the point where I was tired of people trying to sell me stuff and wished I could speak Spanish better. At the beginning of the trip I was like, \"Hi! No, we are not interested now...maybe later...thanks, bye, take care....\"...then at the end I was like, \"No - no deal. I don't want it.\" I wish we had stayed 6 nights. It really makes you miss home and appreciate everything that we have here in our great country. What a great place to stay though and service was wonderful! If we come back we will probably try another hotel, just to see something different, but only because we like other/new places.

After reading numerous reviews before leaving I was a little worried about the service and food to expect but it all turned out great. We travel to a sunny destination at least once per year with our last trips being the Iberostar Lindo in the same area, as well as Secrets and Paradisus in Punta Cana. Overall, I would say a good visit ... not excellent but will explain more. Location: The resort is in a great spot, close walk into Playa del Carmen. One thing to note is even though you can visit the other Riu locations, they are a sort distance away. The other Riu Palace is connected to some of the resorts if that is important for you. Check-in: Check-in was easy/fast. We had no room at arrival as we arrived quite early but just took a quick nap on the beach until the room was ready. I would reccommend to ask for an upgraded room. If anything is available, they will give it to you as the courtyard room views are much nicer than the outside rooms. 5 out of 5 Room: The room was nice, nothing fancy. A little smaller than I expected but nice overall. The mini fridge was stocked daily, and we were amazed at the cleaing service. The room was very clean, and was always done at a good time. As well, they came around so often for new towels, we were feeling guilty when they were not being re-used. 4 out of 5 Restaurants: We had no problem getting reservations for the restaurants which are at either 6:30pm or 9pm I believe. If you e-mail the hotel before you arrive, they will allow 1 reservation. We did this 2 days before leaving and had a reservation set up for the first evening. You can make reservations at the hotel from 12pm-4pm daily for two days so be sure to make them or you may be dining at the buffet each night. After reading some of the reviews, we didn't think the food was going to be good but I would have to say compared to other AI's we have stayed at, it was quite good. Probably liked Sir Oliver's the best, The others like the Japanese, Brazilian and Mexican were good ... not great ... but it is AI. As well, the buffet seemed quite good in comparison as well. We had stayed at the Iberostar Lindo 1 1/2 years ago, and enjoyed the food here much more. 4 out of 5 Spa: My girlfriend loves the spa, and always goes wherever we stay. Her comments were that it was one of the best AI spas that she had visited. Not as good as some of the places at home, but better than her expectations. TIP - Ensure to enroll for your Riu club card as you will save 15% at the spa !!! 5 out of 5 Pool: This is one area that didn't meet our expectations. We love long windy pools that you can dissappear in, but the pool here though nice was small. The pools at the Iberostar are way better. 2 out of 5 Beach: As above, the beach was dissappointing. Out of all of our Carribean AI trips, I would say the Riu Palace had our least favorite beach. It was a bit small, and with the gate at the end didn't seem welcoming. 2 out of 5 Service: Once again, with the reviews was not expecting great service but I have to say I was very impressed by the service levels. This includes the restaurants, room cleaning, the bars ... everything. I would say it was the best service we received at any resort so far. One thing I did notice was that it didn't seem like anyone was tipping anywhere. Please tip these people, they are working very hard. We tipped about $5 for dinners, $5 daily for room cleaning, and tipped the guy stocking the fridge regulary. 5 out of 5 So overall a good trip. I would suggest that if your priorities are a great beach and pool, stay somwhere else. If not the Riu Palace would be a great choice. But for the same price, I thought the Iberostar Lindo was a much better choice/nicer hotel for our needs (PRO-Better pool and beach, CON-food and service not as food). As well, compared to the three trips we have had to Punta Cana, would recommend Punta Cana over the MExican Riviera but that is just our choice.", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cVery relaxing stay in Playa!\u201d", "Author": "eshneken", "ReviewID": "UR6043720", "Content": "My wife and I have returned after a 5 night stay at the Riu Palace Maya Riviera. We read a million of these reviews before going -- all I can say is that most of the negative reviews did have some sort of accuracy to them, but in looking back at them now they are so trivial that I can't believe people even cared about those things. Overall our experience was excellent. The hotel and grounds are absolutely stunning. The pool area is fantastic -- the best I have ever seen. We took a walk along the beach and popped into most of the other hotels in Playacar and none had facilities like this hotel. I was also very impressed with the level of service and friendlines of the staff. Perhaps the folks who wrote reviews complaining about the level of service are royalty who are used to servants waiting on them hand-and-foot. I don't know. The service was really quite excellent. We ate at the Japanese, Mexican, and Gourmet restaurants along with the buffet. The Japanese and Gourmet restaurants were excellent -- we found the Mexican restaurant skippable. The buffets were decent -- good for breakfast and lunch but a little repetitive when it came to dinner. If anything, the food would be the only weak part of this resort. Don't get me wrong -- it was by no means bad nor did it significantly detract from our vacation -- it was simply the only weak link in this fine place. If you are expecting a gourmet experience every meal, you will be dissapointed. If, however, you are going to relax and enjoy your vacation and you are happy with a good breakfast, decent lunch, and some nice dinners you will be pleased. The town of Playa Del Carmen is great and is even walkable from the resort (about 20 minutes walking) or a $5 cab ride. There are lots of great restaurants there -- check out Ula Gula on 5th Avenue and 10th street. If you're looking to party, the discobars on Calle 12 are very cool. If you choose to stay here, be assured that you won't be dissapointed. I can't imagine anyone having less than an above average experience here. tip -- if you are staying off season and they are not full, request a room facing the courtyard. if you are nice and they have space, they will accomodate you. the courtyard view is definitely better than the outside views....", "Date": "November 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "raleigh, nc", "Title": "\u201cLearning curve\u201d", "Author": "karw", "ReviewID": "UR6032396", "Content": "We just returned from celebrating our 37th anniversary.

I am a fussy traveller who expects a true five star experience to include quality lodging & also exemplary service. I am happy to report the Riu Palace surpassed expectations. The property is designed around a large courtyard, which features a very spacious outdoor bar and cafe style area. Taking drinks or wonderful coffees here in the morning or evening is reminiscent of sitting in the wonderful outdoor cafes of Rome or Paris. Many readers question whether or not the better value is the Riu Palace Mexico or the Riu Palace Riviera. Having spent time at both properties, it is my belief that the Riviera is superior to the Mexico in several respects. The hotels appear similar from the outside, the rack rate at the Riviera is somewhat higher than the Mexico, but until recently the Mexico has had better reviews. This confuses some people who don't know which to pick and choose from. Here's my opinion. 1. The pool at the Riviera is much larger than the Mexico. I like to do the occasional lap now and again, and this pool has plenty of room. 2. The a la carte meals in the evening are of greater variety and seem to be somewhat higher quality at the Riviera than the Mexico. Other couples that we spoke with that spent time at both properties (not just people who took a walkthrough) also seemed to be of this view. A well travelled group of people I met while here had spend time at the Riu Palace Las Americas in Cancun a few months before. They felt the Riviera food was to a much higher standard than the Cancun Las Americas. 3. I'm a real stuffy guy, and I'm pleased to report that the service at the Riviera is second to none. The resort is still quite new but now seems to have come through the initial growing pains that generally plague all new properties. In time, Riviera should certainly surpass the Mexico in terms of overall ratings. In the meantime, if you can book the Riviera for close to the same price as the Mexico, you should do so. Food. We ate at all four a la carte restaurants on the property that were open. There are two sittings per evening at each restaurant (6:30 and 8:45 pm or thereabouts) 1. The Japanese restaurant is not a Benihana or ichiban style (communal tables with a cooking show), but a more intimate dining experience. When we arrived at our table, a bottle of California zinfandel was still corked and chilling in a champagne bucket, along with an assortment of 1/2 litre bottles of pop. If we had wanted champagne (actually a decent spanish cava), merlot or cabernet sauvignon, the waiter was happy to oblige. Fresh Sushi arrived shortly thereafter. We had our choice of several very tasty main courses. We felt awfully spoiled at this restaurant. 2. Botofogo is a Brazilian barbeque. Meat is carved at the table, and you get a nice taste of six or seven meats on the menu. Its a fun experience. 3. The Mexican a la carte is very nice. There is a wide assortment of Mexican starter dishes buffet style to begin with, and you order a main course from the menu. We had the steak, done exactly to order and soft enough to cut with a fork. 4. Sir Olivers is the continental restaurant, and considered the hardest reservation to make. My wife had the shrimp and scallop dish and I had a filet mignon with baby potatoes. Really superb. The ambience of this restaurant is very romantic, and the service was over and above what we expected. Chilis steakhouse was not open at this time, as we went during low season. However, with steak offered at the Mexican restaurant and Sir Olivers, you will have plenty of choices to pick and choose from. When you make your reservations, the current policy is that you are allowed to make TWO dinner reservations per day. If you intend to try all four restaurants, it is therefore suggested that you book them over two days. Some groups showed up at the restaurants without reservations at the sittings. Provided that space was available, they were gladly accomodated. We went during shoulder season, so there is generally space, but during high season walk ins may have a harder time. The evening buffet restaurant is by far and away the BEST QUALITY I've eaten at in the Caribbean. Some suggest that when they walk in, they don't see buffet counters buckling under the accumulated weight of trough food, and seem disappointed. This is because much of what is offered is made freshly to order, and offered in individual portions. One evening, the buffet featured duck a l'orange, beef tenderloin, red snapper and marmelade glazed ham. Champagne flows freely at all times, and the waiters gladly accomodate any alcohol request. Shows: high quality cabaret style shows are held each night in a classy and romantic setting. Waiters/waitresses constantly offer to fill your glass while you watch. Prior to each show, a live band with an awfully good singer belts out an assortment of romantic salsa, bachata or merengue tunes for you to practise your moves. We counted 10 waiter/waitresses serving about 100 people one night at the show, which meant quick and efficient service. Rooms: the rooms are of fair size, with tasteful decor, a comfortable balcony, feature the usual RIU alcohol dispenser and plenty of cold beverages replenished frequently. For a pleasant change, there were more hangers in our room than we needed. Beach: quite nice. If you like snorkeling, I suggest that you walk about 25 yards to the right of the Riviera property. At the Wyndham, a man made sea wall (a fat sandbag) has been placed about 50 feet off the shore. This is slowly turning into a reef environment. Beginning snorkellers will see hundreds smaller fish on the deeper side of this wall, which is only 8 feet down. I saw plenty of parrot fish as well as small cuttlefish (squid) over a couple of days, which was fun. A couple of hints. If you want to see an interesting display of wildlife, walk over to the Riu Yucutan in the afternoons. At the back of the property, there is a thriving family of howler monkeys closer to the hotel lobby, living in the trees. They divide their time between the adjacent Iberostar Quetzal property and the Yucutan. The Yucutan also has a large agouti population ( they look somewhat like rats but are related to the guinea pig) which wander the property. Just leave a banana or fruit on the grass by some trees, and the agoutis will come out and eat it. They love fruit. For no haggle souvenirs, the Walmart in Playa Del Carmen is on the corner of 30th avenue and 8th street. Absolutely the cheapest alcohol, cigars and freshest coffee in the city. I bought 15 year old Matusalem rum at Walmart for 179 pesos ($16.50 U.S.) , which sells for $34 at the Cancun airport duty free shops. The exchange rate at Walmart also was better than the Cambios throughout town. DON'T buy so called \"Cuban\" cigars from any shop or vendor, unless the box has a holographic sticker of authenticity attached. The cuban government now places a holograph on genuine boxes (or the three and five packs) of cuban cigars. Even the Montecristos at the Riu don't have these holographs, and when I inspected the cigars, they were just pretty good looking fakes. Spend a lot less money, and just yourself get a decent Mexican cigar from the Walmart tobacco shop. Near the Walmart (on 10th street) are a host of internet cafes. Internet time is generally about 4 pesos for half an hour of use. At the Riu Hotel, it costs about 40 pesos for 15 minutes of internet time. So, if you are in a mood to compose a longer email, do it while you are in town on day trips. Phone cards. Buy a Telmex phone card from your tour rep. 22 minutes of long distance time is $10 U.S. Use it at the small shopping mall quite close to the Riu Palace Mexico, or at any Telmex phone. You'll save a lot of money when compared to the hotel phone. Waiters and waitresses at the hotel may often address you first in Spanish, and switch to English if you don't know Spanish. Don't be alarmed if you don't speak much/any Spanish, as they are all pretty fluent in English. I rather of liked it, as it gave me a chance to practise my limited spanish. TIPPING: My wife and I were actually surprised/shocked/ at how little tipping we saw while at the Riu. Virtually the only other people we saw that provided anything to the staff were generally Canadian. Apparently, some persons take tour operator brochures quite literally when it is stated that tipping is included. People, please! Its a posh hotel! A certain gentleman from Houston actually asked me to translate his expectation to a waitress that he be given back $4.50 from a five dollar he gave her, after watching her run her run back and forth to the bar for an entire evening...serving a VERY large party. I was mortified for both him and the waitress serving him. I greatly appreciated their efforts to make my stay enjoyable. so, I I tipped $5 U.S. dollars at each a la carte restaurant, $2 for the maid each day and a few dollars each time for the breakfast, lunch and evening buffet waiter. It seemed awfully cheap for the quality of what I received. You receive the same great service whether or not you choose to tip. However, its a pretty swanky hotel, even by U.S. standards. Leaving $.25 or $.50 is just plain rude. Also, tipping the maid at the end of the week is a no no. Maids often change shifts mid week. Consequently the end of week tippers, probably wind up shorting one or more of their maids, and then provide a semi decent tip someone who has never actually made up your room. In closing, for us, the Riviera represented our best all around resort vacation in Mexico. I would certainly say that the hotel is nicer than the Royal Hideaway (just a few properties down), and certainly a cut above any other Riu property in the area.

Also, the hotel has neigboring hotels on either side and any room on the outside of the hotel has a view of these hotels; very few rooms have a full ocean view.

Have been to 7 different RIUs, a couple of them multiple times. RIU is the best value for the money, period! We stayed at the Palace Riviera Maya from Oct 7-13, 2006. RIU Palace Riviera Maya is beautiful. Its almost new, and is as clean and friendly as any of them. We even got upgraded to one of the 8 \"super\" suites with the spiral staircase to an upper floor with a jaccuzi tub (never used it) and several chairs. One of the very few \"Ocean View\" rooms we've ever had at a RIU. In fact, many rooms at the R.P.R.M. have ocean views, and thats a plus. Surprise, we give the room a 9 out of 10. Only problem is that it seems the resort shuts off all air cond. between about 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. Maybe not, but it sure seemed that way. No light or fan in the shower area. But my, it was beautiful...and very clean! Food was pretty good, even though this was not a peak period and the resort was far from full, meaning that you had only one choice for breakfast, the main buffet. It was good, but during peak periods I believe you have more choices. We went to Sir Oliver and it was very good. Also did the Mexican and it was very good. Lunch was always at \"Chili's\" by the beach and it was always good. Can't beat the self serve Corona tap! Excellent soups, breads, salads and a good variety of entree's. O.K., not gourmet but more than satisfactory. Give it 8 out of 10. Beach/Pool. We are beach people. Spent one afternoon in the pool over-indulging in mudslides by the pool bar. Absolutely the friendliest bartenders, better than most RIUs. The pool was not crowded and was very inviting. No obnoxious drunks to be found. The beach was...better than o.k. Rocky on the left as you face the ocean but fine to the right. We parked our chaises to the left and walked a few yards to the right to enter the ocean. The water was a little rough, cloudy with sand, and more green than blue for the first few days, but soon cleared and became more \"caribbean blue\".. It was always caribbean blue after the first 30 ft. Don't pay any attention whatsoever to complaints about the \"wall\". There is a section of \"seawall\" between some of the chaises and the lower beach. It goes from zero inches to about four feet at most, and there are stairs in several spots. Our daily walk to the beach included a three step stairway to \"our spot\". Never a problem getting loungers, never. Hobie Cats, kayaks and paddle boats always available. Beach/pool 9 out of 10. Riu has started a new position, a \"Public Relations\" person. Judith was the main one we dealt with. Judith was everywhere, met just about everyone and wanted to know what she could do to make our stay more enjoyable. We asked for champaign in our room...and it was done! Next day we asked for two bottles since the first went too quickly. Judith came back apologetically, saying that they were delivering one bottle right away but tht they had run out of champaign, but that by noon the next day a new shipment was due to arrive and she would have it delivered. She was off that next day but guess what....it was delivered that next afternoon. Definately utilize the \"P.R.\" resource. We give this a 12 out of 10! Now, as a comparison, I'd rank the R.P.R.M. just below the Riu Palace Mexico, a couple hundred yards south. I'd rank the Riu Palace Macao in the Dominican Republic between the two, and the Riu Club Hotel Ocho Rios (Jamaica) right up there as well. Sandals resorts may (do) offer a bit more but they cost a LOT more. We do Sandals for the \"special\" trips, 20 yr anniversary, etc., but we go to RIU every other chance we get! I'm a scuba diver and Scuba Caribe is right on property. With five or six Riu's in proximity, they do a good job of filling dive boats. One day I had to take a jet ski from the Palace R.M. to the Palace Mexico to meet the boat (Sunday), but other days the boat left directly from the R.M. Great bunch of staff at the R.M.

This is based on two things. First is the hotel site itself which is crammed in with a bunch of other hotels. If you want someplace secluded then this is not it! Second are the restaurants/food which are passable but not very good. We ate at the Mexican restaurant our first night and the Gourmet restaurant the second night. Both meals were just so so and the atmosphere was pretty but lifeless. They don't even play music which makes for a VERY quiet evening. They also allow children in all of the restaurants and while I have children of my own, I do not think it's appropriate in the more upscale establishments at the resort. One couple actually had a portable TV so that their son could watch \"Dora\" while they ate. For our last two nights we gave up and did the buffet. We actually preferred this even though everyone warned us that the buffets are bad. We loved not needing a reservation and having the option to sit outside which none of the other places have. The food in the buffet was pretty much the same as what was offered in the restaurants but at least you could see for yourself and find other options if you didn't like what you got. On the positive side, the grounds inside the hotel, including the courtyard, pool area and beach, were lovely. It is IMPERATIVE that you get a courtyard/ocean view so you don't have to look at all of the crap that surrounds the hotel. Our view was great.

We took some friends with us and had a great time. The Trip started out a little bad but turned out really well on our part. To begin with, We had originally scheduled ourselves at the Riu Cancun hotel but with a week to go, our travel agent called and said that the Riu Cancun had overbooked their hotel. That was a bad sign, Then they called and Said that the Riu palace resorts wanted to make us an offer. They said if we would go to the Riu Palace Riviera Maya in Playa Del Carmen they would not only upgrade us to the 5 star hotel from the 4 star, they would also give us a free 7 day vacation next year for free at any Riu resort that is 4 star or lower. That was our first obstacle that we overcame. Then we took our flight out of St. Louis non stop to Cancun. Their was a little mix up on our transportation to the hotel which was an hour south of Cancun. They ended up putting all four of us in a Dodge Stratus ( Good thing we were all close friends) haha..!!! That was the second obstacle that we overcame. Then came \"our\" first room ! The first room was ok but had an odor that was really bad. They tried to take care of it but they allowed us to move after day 2. Then everything became great. The people were so helpful and friendly. The kept everything stocked in our room and also kept it very clean. Made some really good friends while we were there. Would recommend to couples and families. Not a really big party place, which was ok by me. But did have soom good points. I recommend taking the Mayan Ruins tour!!

We are travel agents and were there to inspect several resorts in the area. I have stayed at Riu properties in Playacar before, as well as in Punta Cana, Cancun, and Jamaica. RPRM was the same classic design as the Riu Palace Punta Cana, meaning absolutely gorgeous. Resort was impeccably spotless. Beds are the same as other Riu properties. They are firmer than most, but I was able to sleep with no problem, and my bed at home is MUCH softer. The beach on the left side was VERY rocky. If you want your feet to stay in one piece, swim on the right side, lots of soft sand. Rooms were spotless. They were cleaned and restocked daily with nightly turndown service. Restaurants- Agave- Mexican restaurant: the food was tasty and well prepared here. The buffett for appetizers was very good and the service was very good. Sergio is a sweetie who will go above and beyond to accomodate you, including pouring double shots of Cuervo during dinner. Since we were there during the off season, the steak house was also located in Agave. Again, food was tasty, seafood was very tasty. Sir Oliver- Gourmet- I have eaten in Sir Oscars in PUJ and the gourmet restaurant in Negril in Jamaica so I was looking forward to an excellent meal. I was dissapointed in both the food and the service. My partner had to go to the bar himself in order to get a beer twice. The food took an incredibly long time to arrive, and they forgot one of the appetizers we ordered. The appetizers were very good, but the main course was so dissapointing. Filet mignon were actually medallions of beef. Good, but not what I ordered. The shrimp were ok, overcooked, but the scallops were tasteless and bland, like they had been thawed and refrozen several times. Desert was ok. Main buffett- Again I was a little disappointed. I usually look forward to the breakfast buffett, but it was very limited, warm juices, stale pastries, and lukewarm coffee. DON\"T do breakfast at Chilis on the beach, not good at all. Lunch was better at Chilis. Room service was quick and good. Pool was great, nice and big and the drinks were plentiful. Laura at the front desk is a wonderful help with anything you may need. I hope with a little time, this Riu will become as wonderful as the rest I have stayed at.

We found the front desk, bell and wait staff to be courteous and helpful upon our arrival and throughout our stay. The lobby architecture is breathtaking. There is always someone cleaning everything, so the entire resort is spotless. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again. There are some glitches they still need to work on, but nothing that can't be overcome. ROOMS - THE GOOD: Spotlessly clean, nicely decorated. THE NOT SO GOOD: We were taken to our first room and two male members of the housekeeping staff were in the room - which wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact that they were in the process of tossing back a Corona from the refrigerator in the room. It was a first floor room with a view directly into the hotel next door - which seems to be normal procedure for this hotel from what I've read and heard from other guests while we were there. (One guest we spoke to had taken a poll of the other guests, and every single one had been put into a room on that side. If you spoke to the manager, you were upgraded to a courtyard room, if you spoke to the girl at the front desk, you did not get a room change.) Then the toilet didn't work. Initially they told us they would put in a work order, but when I pointed out we had just arrived and hadn't even unpacked, , they immediately moved us to a different room on the second floor. I do have to admit being disappointed in the beds - they were very hard with only a thin mattress pad. If you are short, or have any joint issues you may have trouble getting into the shower - I'm only 5' tall and the tub wall was well above my knees. Sound carries in very clearly from the hallways - including screaming children at 2 a.m. FOOD - THE GOOD: Arriving on a Thursday, the hotel was quiet and we were able to get into the gourmet restaurant without reservations. The service was impeccable and the food delicious. We had bruschetta, pasta with shrimp and mussels, mussels Rockefeller, duck, filet, and crepes suzette with vanilla ice cream. Absolutely fabulous. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet. It contained a variety of breads, pastries, smoothies and juices, mimosas, granolas and cereal bases to create your own, omelette chef, a hot line with bacon, sausage, hash browns, poached and scrambled eggs, sopapillas, and a fruit and cheese buffet as well. THE NOT SO GOOD: Definitely skip the Agave and Japanese restaurants. While the appetizer buffet at the Agave is decent, the main courses and desserts are inedible - varying from under to overcooked. We heard that the Brazilian restaurant there was \"okay\" though we didn't try it ourselves. Chilis was okay for lunch, but nothing to get excited about. BARS - the swim up bar is nice with the separate little table and seating areas in the pool as well. The bartenders could use a bit more training as they seem to do fine with the hotel specialties, but had difficulty with layered drinks such as a B52, and didn't have a good knowledge of how to prepare many basic bar drinks. Watch out for bartender Hilario - he is definitely on the prowl and we had difficulty keeping him off one of our group members. Definitely try the Batida de Coco! POOL/BEACH: THE GOOD: chairs/lounges were always available, lots of umbrellas for shade, beach sand was soft and clean, the people who did the water aerobics really seemed to enjoy it. THE NOT SO GOOD: wait staff minimal to nonexistent. MISC: On Thursday night vendors were allowed to set up in the courtyard. If you want a hammock, haggle and buy it from the guy there - best price we saw in Playa. There's also a guy who sets up and makes cigars (he was there Thursday and Saturday) - my boss enjoyed the one we brought back for him. We give the divemasters and scuba concession there five stars - very friendly and knowledgeable. The shopping plaza that is within walking distance isn't bad, just make sure you negotiate - the leather shop came down on their price by 60%. And if you want a henna tatoo there are a couple of carts that do them for $8-20 depending on the complexity and size of the design. Our one off resort excursion was a snorkeling trip from Maroma. We were taken out on a catamaran to two different sites on the reef - one hour each time in the water. Both were excellent sites for viewing marine life. And we discovered that the fish love jalapeno cheetos (provided by the crew) - with patience, you can get them to eat from your hand. Even though I'm not a strong swimmer, it was still a nice excursion. The catamaran ran on motor the whole time which was fine, it made for a very nice ride. Take small bills because the swing bar has trouble making change over 20 pesos. Beware when you get back, you may get stuck at the on-site restaurant for an hour or more while you wait for your shuttle back to your hotel - chips, beer, soda, and water are free - everything else is not. And no one seemed particularly thrilled with the food they were served. OVERALL: We really enjoyed ourselves and the RPRM as did everyone we met while there. Admittedly, its not perfect, but few places are, especially when they are as new as this one is.

On arrival, I was put in a room with a view to the bowels of the budget hotel next door - a room that shouldn't be rented to the public, in my view. After complaining to the front desk I was moved to something on the ground level with a view of the lovely courtyard, and the hotel was far from full, so I don't know why they didn't offer this room from the outset. Strangely, the front desk clerk told me the first room was an oceanview room, but you couldn't see water from anywhere in the room or the deck. Food quality at the restaurants was particularly disappointing. I've stayed in several Riu Palace properties and always found a great selection of high-quality food at the dinner buffet. This time, I found nothing but cheap ingredients carelessly prepared; no chocolate fountain (which I understood to be a Riu Palace signature item) or paella. Breakfast buffet had only cheap, greasy cold cuts instead of the smoked salmon that I usually find. The courteous wait staff found me some smoked salmon in the back, but it was a lengthy wait each morning. Rooms were pleasant, seemed a little smaller than other Riu Palace properties, and were quite noisy when the neighbors came and went. My advice to management is to invest in some soundproofing for the room doors, and to tell the chef to stop cutting so many corners in food quality.

We tried the steakhouse and the mexican resturants, but we both agreed that the buffet had better if not at least a fresher and of course a bigger variety of food. We never had difficulty trying to get a chair at the pool or beach, and I didn't see any kind of wall at the beach from the hurricae season last year. We enjoyed the included kayaks and pool volleyball. The night shows were good....not too much to do at night but if you wanted a great night life you should stay in cancun. Our room was beautiful and spotless...and definatly the coolest place in playa del carmen....just have to remember to keep the balcony door closed if you are going to have it on...it automatically shuts off if the door is open. The jets in the bathtub in the room were great....and the one time we called to get more water/soda for the minifridge it was there in no time.

We had 2 adjoining rooms as we have 2 children 13 (picky eater) & 17. Let me start off by saying that it is truly a beautiful hotel. Very clean and spacious. The rooms are well appointed with a step down area to view the TV. Our room overlooked the property next door \u2013 nothing to look at. Rooms were very quiet. The rooms (with separate entrances) are adjoined by a small hallway with a communal door. This door did not close the 1st day. We brought it to the staff\u2019s attention and it was fixed the next day. We too experienced problems with the doors locking one day. One of the kids had gone back to the room and noticed that it did not lock after leaving. There was someone there fixing it later that day. Pool - There is not enough shade on the beach or near the pool. The tiles around the pool are dark and of course absorb all the heat so you should wear your shoes to the pools edge or risk searing your feet off. The umbrellas are just the cloth/wooden garden variety and do not provide enough shade protection. There were plenty of broken arms on the umbrellas as well, considering the hotel just opened this year. Beach \u2013 there is a rocky area that is good for snorkeling \u2013 kids saw plenty of fish. To the right of that the water was crystal clear most days, fairly deep though, not suitable for little ones. Again, there is absolutely no shade. With our fair Canadian skin, 95 degree weather with lots of sunshine and no rain, our SPF 50 didn\u2019t do a great job from making us walking tomatoes! Activities \u2013 They were always scheduled for a certain time. For example, rifle shooting @ 10:00, Bingo @ 4:00, Bocci @ 3:00. You cannot do them when you want to. My kids are used to playing Ping Pong whenever they want at a resort and then joining a tournament at a specific time. There is not a lot for teenagers to do activity wise. Mine didn\u2019t complain at all though. They were quite happy between the pool and the ocean. Also they only play music at the pools during certain times of the day. The beach party was a bit of a disappointment. They did have a live band for an hour and some dancing on the beach but that was it. They served up some fresh fruit as well. A bbq or paella would have been nice to have on the beach \u2013 we have seen this at other resorts less than 5 stars. Entertainment \u2013 You must see the Mayan show. It was spectacular. It is an insight to the Mayan culture and very professionally performed. Other dance shows are put on by the Riu dancers. It is nice to see a performing group at night rather than the staff who work during the day in other jobs as in the case of other resorts that we have stayed at. It\u2019s not Las Vegas quality but entertaining nonetheless. Food \u2013 Here goes. This is where we have a difference of opinion. Last year we stayed at the Palladium in Puerto Vallerta. I didn\u2019t mind the food, neither did my picky 13 year old. At the Riu we found the buffet food not hot enough on numerous occasions, it was barely warm. There were no chafing dishes, just heat lamps over brick tiles. The salads on the other hand were not chilled enough. Most of the time they were room temperature and that room was outside (Chili\u2019s) and about 90 degrees. There were lots of creamy salads and I didn\u2019t want to take any chances. Beef was served very rare. I tried to stay away from that sort of food but I still managed to Montazuma\u2019s revenge. That didn\u2019t happen last year in PV. My husband & daughter were struck with it when we got home. The picky eater was fine of course! The buffet food didn\u2019t have much variety from day to day. Very greasy and covered in sauces. There is only hot milk for your coffee. Sometimes it was curdled. The coffee was terrible and not very hot. The 17 year old says we are too picky, we say we paid twice as much for this palace as we did for the Palladium in PV \u2013 it should be better. We ate twice @ Sir Oliver\u2019s. Service was excellent. Food wasn\u2019t bad. The duck was excellent according to those who ate it, as was the beef and the seafood skewers. Again, not very hot. We had dinner @ the Steakhouse another night. The chicken breast was too dry. Myself and the picky eater had the rib eye steak. Reminiscent of Ponderosa = very fatty. Picky eater thought it was great. Husband had the tenderloin \u2013 far too small for his appetite. Again, served lukewarm. We were scheduled to eat there again, but a Manager had tracked us down one night @ Sir Oliver\u2019s at told us that there was a wedding reception booked for that specific night and that we could eat elsewhere if we wanted other reservations. I didn\u2019t understand how they can take reservations for something that\u2019s not available. It really didn\u2019t matter as the food there wasn\u2019t that great anyway. We weren\u2019t missing anything! Service \u2013 Service was very inconsistent and in our opinion not of 5 star quality. The first couple of days we had turn down service and then it stopped completely. Some days we had hand towels, some days the bath mats were in the place of hand towels. (Hotel was at approx. 42% occupancy so there is no excuse). Some days the blanket was put on the bed and made up other days it was up in the closet. We did tip everyday and even gave some gifts of makeup & toiletries but that didn\u2019t seem too matter. The waiters in the restaurants are constantly re-filling your glasses with your beverage (opening the Pepsi bottles) or pouring water for you. It\u2019s nice but it gets to be annoying after 4 or 5 times. It seems like they are always around, yet they are nowhere to be found when you\u2019d like a coffee or tea after dinner. Or when the plates need to be picked up. The nightclub/theatre is another story. It seems only men take your drink orders and the women bring them to you. Service is great for the 1st \u00bd hour or so and then you can barely get a drink. It\u2019s feast or famine. Three waiters will ask you if you want something and you\u2019ve already ordered. Also, they are obsessed about changing the drink coasters. It\u2019s like they change them every 15 minutes. Enough already! We are trying to watch the show and there they are changing the coasters for the 5th time. We ordered room service at night a few times, nachos & cheese for the most part were ok except the last night there, completely soggy. The club sandwich is soaked with mayo. The selection is very limited on the menu but we were surprised to see food that wasn\u2019t on the menu on trays outside other rooms. Guess you have to ask. One night when we were leaving to go to the show we found a tray of chocolate covered strawberries outside our communal door. We didn\u2019t touch it as God knows how long it was there and besides the hallway is about 90 degrees. We spoke with our Sunquest rep and expressed our thoughts on how this could be rated as a 5 star resort. I think she has heard similar concerns from others and mentioned how the staff doesn\u2019t appear to try as hard when it\u2019s a such a low occupancy (42%). This vacation wasn\u2019t cheap even though it was discounted, but I don\u2019t think it was worth anywhere near the money that we paid. It\u2019s a beautiful place but not enough bang for your buck On the plus side \u2013 no bugs, crabs or lizards!!! Close to town \u2013 which is terrific. Went to Xcaret for 1 day. Pretty pricey but very interesting. Kids enjoyed themselves.

We made the mistake of trying a different resort this year, the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. This was our honeymoon trip. We were told that we would have champane and fruit basket in our room. We discovered no champane and 5 chocolate strawberries in our room. I requested some champane, even offered to pay for it, but it never showed up. The managment as well as the front desk were not really rude but more like snobish, as if we were not important enough to worry about. The buffet was excellent, even though it was basically the same for every meal. We never got to eat at one of the restarunts because of the extremly long lines for the reservations. The beach was ok, the ocean ok to swim but not snorkle. The pool was very nice but it closed at 8 every night. The shows were ok but after the show was over, (11:00) that was it. The only bar open was the sports bar. O yes, room service stops at 11:00 , so if you want a midnight snack your only option is a frozen hamburger or hotdog in the sportsbar. Our room was nice, but then again it is a brand new resort. Our patio view was nice if you like to look at the rooftop of the kitchen next door. I did request to exchange the tequlia for a bottle of gin but they said they could not do that. We arrived on sat night and by mon morning we were done with it. We went to our funjet rep and requested a transfer to our normal resort, Barcelo. He was not very happy, and to make a long story short we basically had to arrange our own transfer. Interestingly enough as soon as the front desk found out we were transfering the guy who stocks the wet bar came to our room and put a 12 pack of Carona in the fridge and offered to get my gin for me complete with some bottles of tonic water. Any way we spent the rest of our nine day honeymoon at a 4 star resort with an awesome ocean view room and had a blast.

I traveled with my husband and our 19 year old son and 2 of his friends. We have stayed at many 5 star resorts and base this review on what we have experienced at other 5 star resorts (one being the Moon Palace in Riviera Maya). What was the most important to me was a good beach with clear blue water (Moon Palace's beach was horrible and the water wasn't blue or clear), a pool with pool bar, and day and night-time activites. I loved the beach and the water. Looking at pictures on this sight I thought that I would be disppointed because of the sea wall, but there is plenty of beach and I was very happy with the beach. The pool was adequate, however if you don't get a lounge chair in the morning you won't get one until evening and the pool bar closes at 5:00 which was very disappointing, the daytime activities were good but the eveing shows were not great (no where near as good as the shows on a cruise ship). We ate at the buffets every night except for one night at the steak restaurant (Chili's). The food was very good. There was a great variety and lots of it. All of us that ate steak at Chili's thought the steak was fabulous. The two that got pork tenderloin were very disappointed, as the pork was very dry. They compared it to eating a hockey puck. The drinks are great, the best we have had at an all inclusive resort. The rooms are average to above average. The hair dryer is tiny and would shut off when I tried to straighten my hair. For children, the elderly, or handicapped traveler, the tub will be a problem. The wall to get into the tub/shower is over 2' high. The beds are hard; I don't like hard beds but had no problem being comfortable while sleeping. We had problems often with the card entry to our room. Many times the room would not lock. Our son's room didn't get made up one day. There are a lot of tiny ants on the balconies and in the buffet restaurant. Don't sit near the windows as this is where we saw ants climbing up the curtains, walls, and on our table. The restaurant is huge so you will have no problem sitting away from the windows where we had no problems with ants. The desk staff was great. I was disappointed with the rest of the staff, many were not very friendly and seemed to expect to be tipped. Ian, who works for Olympus for excursions, was very friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and honest. I would highly recommend using him to book any excursions. He will be in the lobby in an orange shirt. I loved the location of the resort, it is within walking distance to a small shopping mall and close to Playa de Carmen. The streets and sidewalks are constructed with pavers. It seems much safer than other areas we have stayed. I would have had no problem walking to the mall by myself. Just be careful if you walk the beach. One morning, 6:30am, I walked the beach with one of my son's friends. We walked as far as we could. When we were almost to the end we saw 5 armed policemen a few yards in front of us. Not knowing if they were really police was very scary. We knew we couldn't run so decided to walk past them and hope for the best. Luckily they really were police. A traveler we meet told us that he walked the beach every morning and ran into them in the same area. He said they go to this specific area to nap. My son and his friend's had a great time. The played beach volleyball every day. They went to the disco and were very disappointed. They also said that the worker at the sport's bar was very unfriendly. All in all we had a great time. I do not think I will return to this resort, primarily because I wanted more night life and the pool bar closed too early. I thought the resort promoted more then they actually provided in that department.", "Date": "August 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201call-inclusive in Riviera Maya\u201d", "Author": "badtrips1", "ReviewID": "UR5562925", "Content": "We stayed in the RIU Riviera Maya Palace Hotel, located in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, approximately one hour south of Cancun.

When we arrived at the airport in Cancun we were a little overwhelmed by all the people trying to sell you something. When I booked the resort online directly through the Riu website, our stay included ground transportation. The communication from Riu on the ground transfer was very good and descriptive. A man greeted us inside the terminal (looked official - was wearing a photo id badge) and asked us where we were going and who our transportation was lined up with and that he would direct us where we needed to go. He said there was a lot of construction going on at the airport and his job was to help us. Okay, we bought that explanation. He led us to a guy at a desk still inside the terminal and we figured he was with \"Hotel Beds\" which was the company transferring us to Riu. It took us a few minutes chatting to figure out this guy was trying to get us to go listen to a presentation at the Aventure Spa Palace on their \"Palace Premier Club\" which they point out is not a timeshare. They offered lots of goodies: cab fare to/from Riu to Aventura Palace, breakfast, 2 tickets to Tulum tour, 2 tickets to Chichen Itza tour, 2 tickets to Paradise Snorkeling Tour, 2 tickets to ATV/Speedboat tour, and $200 spa credit at Aventura Palace. I wanted to see their property anyway (I plan incentive trips for a living), we wanted to do some tours, and figured it couldn't be that bad. So that's what we did the next morning. It wasn't too bad. The sales rep was pleasant, we had a nice conversation at breakfast, and got a thorough tour of the property. Their vacation club offer was interesting if you're people who vacation regularly but we're not those kind of people. They really put the pressure on (bringing in her manager, then her manager's manager) for about an hour, but all in all it was painless and we walked away with all the stuff they promised. We didn't even have enough time take advantage of all the stuff. If you don't like sales pressure, don't do it. Moving onto Riu... The property is new & clean & beautiful. The first guy we talked to at the front desk had to get someone else because he didn't speak English. We were a little surprised at that but it was okay. The guy explained how everything at the resort works, took our credit card for payment, gave us our room keys and safe key, and we were on our way. All the rooms are suites, meaning they have a sleeping area and sitting area. It's all in one big room but it's a nice size. All rooms have balconies, too. We had a view of the resort next door but it was okay because we weren't in the room much anyway. If we had a view of the pool and/or courtyard we may have spent time on the balcony. The people-watching was great. The room was pretty but seemed very humid. Even cranking the air conditioning didn't pull out the humidity. We're from Houston so we are used to humidity and we still felt it. The bed was hard. Really hard. Really really hard. Amazingly, though, we slept okay. The shower in our bathroom had problems draining. It would take hours to drain after we showered. We called the Front Desk about this once, they apologized for the inconvenience and said they would send someone to fix it. We don't know if anyone ever came to look at it, but it certainly didn't get fixed. All the floors were tile - lobby, hallways, rooms. This was a good idea because carpets & humidity aren't a good combination. There were always people cleaning the floors, too. Everything was very, very clean. We got up early most mornings either to watch the sunrise or leave on a tour. And each morning there were swarms of resort staff cleaning the grounds getting ready for the day. All of the resort staff were pleasant. From the Front Desk to the restaurant staff to the cleaning staff to the bartenders. Smiling & friendly always. The pool area was always pretty crowded and it may have been difficult to find a lounge chair, but we always went to the beach. We never had a problem getting lounge chairs there. The swim-up bar was fun and always very lively. They had high-energy music playing, but it seemed like the same song over & over, day after day. The only restaurants we ate at were Don Manolo's & Chili's. We never ate at the reservations-only places for dinner. We were happy with the enormous buffets. They had food for every taste, lots of bread, and fantastic desserts. The waitstaff was on top of everything. When your water glass was empty (and they were small and we drink alot of water), they filled it before you had to ask. When you finished your 1st plate and left to go back to the buffet for dessert, you're 1st plate had been cleared by the time you returned. There were white linens on the tables and once you were finished with your meal, there was someone there to quickly change the linen and re-set the table. They were amazing. And, of course, very friendly. The first night we weren't sure if we were supposed to tip them and so we watched a few other people who were finishing their meals and saw no tipping. On the last night, though, we left a tip. We left the maid $2-3 each night with a little thank you note. We don't know if that made a difference in service or not. One night she left a towel snail that was really cute. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room with bottled water, beer, and soft drinks. The town of Playa del Carmen is a 10-15 minute walk down the road. The other direction is Plaza Playacar which is about a 5 min walk. It's a very small shopping plaza but it basically had the same stuff you found in town. Once you've seen one shop, you've seen them all. Mostly tourist junk. We took advantage of the kayaks available on the beach as part of the all-inclusive. Snorkeling equipment was available, too, but we had brought our own. There was a little bit to see when you're snorkeling, but not too much. We wanted to do the paddleboats but the water was too choppy. They also had windsurfing equipment (big boards w/small sails - for beginners) & small sailboats (Hobie Cats) - they recommend making reservations for these the day before you want them. Scuba Caribe is the name of the water sports place on property - again, very nice & friendly. The non-motorized sports are included, but scuba diving & parasailing are not. They don't rent waverunners but the resort next door did. We parasailed ($70 for two people). It was fun because they pick you up on the beach in a waverunner & drive you out to the boat. We ended up being on the boat about 45 min before it was our turn to parasail. As soon as you're done parasailing, the waverunner picks you up and takes you back to the beach. You end up being up in the air for 8-10 min. Later when were were on the beach watching all of the different parasailing boats, we noticed one that gave you a much longer ride and seemed to go higher. There were guys walking up & down the beach selling parasailing and we didn't know which ones were giving the long rides. I'm sure it was more expensive but you sure got a great ride. Each night at 9:45pm there was a show. It was different every night we were there, but we only stayed for the beginning of one of the shows. Our days were so full that we were too tired to stick around. Two of the nights the resort had vendors come in and set-up their merchandise around one of the fountains. It was right outside the restaurants where there was a bar, live music, and lots of outdoor seating. Generally, you could buy anything there that you could buy in town and then some. It was a nice arrangement. Maybe it was more expensive, maybe not. It was great atmosphere, though. Each evening after dinner we parked ourselves on a couch next to the cigar-roller lady (because it had the best view of the plaza) and people-watched. Loads of fun. There were lots of Europeans & South Americans which made for a fun variety of languages being spoken & swimsuit fashions being worn. There were some topless ladies which was probably thrilling for the American teenage boys. I guess that's it. We had a nice time and would go back. I hope this helps! We read many reviews on TripAdvisor before we booked the resort. The one that was really negative and mentioned the toilet brush in brown water next to the toilet was pretty funny. It was cleaning fluid. Those people must not have traveled much and/or are incredibly spoiled.

He is the captain of the Mexican restaurant who took care of the restaurant reservations and always did his best to comply with our requests. We particularly enjoyed dinning at the Sir Oliver (gourmet) and, off course, the Ogave (Mexican) restaurant. The Steak house was pretty good too, and it was great to have a nice dinner with ocean view. We did not eat at the Japanese restaurant. During our dinner at Ogave, my 3 year old wanted to eat some strawberries and although it was not on the menu, one waiter brought him a plate with some big strawberries. Sergio came over and asked my son if he wanted some whipped cream. He brought him a plate of nicely decorated strawberries with the cream in the middle and when my daughter requested some, he gladly complied. Sergio was great and almost everyone else had the same kind attitude of pleasing the guests. The Brazilian Restaurant was the only one that we did not enjoy. Not only the food was not that good, but the staff was very grumpy and nasty. One of the waiters even made a personal comment to me that I did not enjoy at all. The entertainment staff was GREAT.

It was a very nice area, very safe to walk around with many nice hotels and beautiful houses. My husband found a motorcycle rental in the Tequila and he took the kids around.

But if you're looking for the kind of vacation where everything is taken care of and you can just flop on the beach or by the pool, then this is the place for you. ROOM: When we first checked in, I was a little weary about staying on the first floor facing the outside garden. But we figured that before we complained for a better room, we should give the one we were in a chance and ended up being very happy. The room was quiet, very clean and the AC worked great (almost too well- we woke up some nights freezing!). We didn't use the mini bar very much, but every two evenings someone would come to our door asking if we needed anything. My only complaint was the lack of towels- we were lucky if we got two fresh ones, despite leaving used towels in the tub (if you don't do that they won't replace them, BTW). FOOD: was OK. I wasn't expecting very much, and it ended up being better than I thought. You definitely won't starve. We went to Chili's and Sir Olivers for our \" a la carte\" meals\", neither of them were great. The reservation process was really annoying, so we didn't bother after the first two days. Breakfast buffet was the best, lunch and dinner were mediocre. The best meal we had was in Playa Del Carmen at Yaxche (calle 8 and av 5). Be sure to have a Mayan coffee if you go- quite the production with all the fire! BEACH: very beautiful, nice soft sand, clear water. No shade at all though, so be careful and use lots of sun screen! POOL: Impossible to get a chair after 10.

Also, it was too far from the airport, compared to some other hotels. We had asked for an ocean front suite, since it was our anniversary, and were given one of the gorgeous rooms on the end, overlooking the sea. It was the closest to the pools, too.

You can only make reservations at a certain time, for only 2 at a time, and can't do it until you arrive, so we had some issue with that. We actually waited to see if we could get an empty table at that gourmet place, and we were lucky to get that our last night. That's probably my only complaint about the whole trip! One off task comment - we did an excursion through Apple vacations, called \"Mayan Adventure\" - if you like to snorkel, this was great b/c it took you to three snorkeling spots, a lagoon, an underground cave (very cool!) and a \"cenote\", where you could jump in off a 10-15 foot cliff (I took the steps!).

We had a wonderful time and have recommended it highly to friends. We had a major complication at the beginning of the stay, but the management resolved the problem to our complete satisfaction. The whole facility is beautiful. We liked the fact that all of the restaurants, bars, and lobby were air conditioned with the exception of the pool area. Everything was kept immaculately with constant cleaning by the staff. The resort can be as active as you would like (plenty of activity for our 17 year old son) or as relaxing as you\u2019d like (hammocks on the beach for my husband & I). The rooms are gorgeous and very spacious. We found the bed to be very comfortable. I would classify it as firm, but not hard. The food was the best we have found at an all-inclusive resort. They had smoked salmon on the lunch buffet, large varieties of fruits and vegetables, and Mimosa\u2019s for breakfast. We ate in all of the ala carte restaurants and were pleased with them all. We found the Mexican and Sir Oliver\u2019s to be the best. Service on a whole was very good. There were a few meals in which we had to solicit service from the servers, but that was the exception rather than the rule. The reservation system is the biggest down side. By allowing reservations to be made only during the afternoon, it eliminates anyone who is off site for an excursion. We found it difficult to get into Sir Oliver\u2019s, but finally just arrived and waited for a \u201cno show\u201d spot. It worked for us and we were pleased that we were able to eat there. The beach is lovely. It is by far the best along that strip. We snorkeled off the beach on days that the water was calm and saw some good fish. When the wind was up and the water choppy, the visibility was very cloudy. Rig two chairs for shade as other writers have suggested. We checked out the other Riu facilities in Playacar and realized that ours was by far the best. The Riu Palace Mexico is very nice, but the pool leaves a lot to be desired.

The staff are amazing and we got quite paranoid towards the end of our holiday as someone was always asking if we needed anything more.I even joked with management and said there was a cloud over the sun and could they do something about it. Reception called our room on numerous occasions to see if we required anything.Room service was excellant with different arrangements of towels every day. The food is awesome, always different theme nights and several different stations cooking anything from paella, mexican or international dishes plus all the usual buffet style food.Tip the chefs as well as the waiters, they certainly dont forget you.Booking for the other restraunts was very easy and the waiter service was excellent. Sir Olivers was our favourite.Finding a seat by the pool was never a problem and there are plenty of loungers by the beach. There is a retaining wall but this is not a problem as people took loungers down next to the beach if required. it is a short walk to other Riu hotels which we were free to visit but I rate this hotel as the best location.Ok it did rain occasionally, but just get in the pool, it soon passes. Entertainment staff were to die for. Being in our 60`s we felt no age barrier and met some lovely people. My only complaint is with the airline Thomson Fly. We booked premium seating but compared to other airlines it was not worth it apart from priority check in at Cancun. This airport as everybody knows suffered hurricane damage so things do get a bit busy during check in.

The hotel and the grounds are absolutely beautiful. The staff and service are awesome. They are definitely there to serve their guests. The pool is nice, although we didn't get in one time. There are plenty of chairs and shade umbrellas at the pool. It looked like you should get to the pool early in order to get a chair. We have been to Playa Del Carmen many times. We love this area and we go beacause we love the beach and the ocean. Their beach was nice, plenty of chairs, but no shade. This was a huge disappointment to us. There were palm trees, but they aren't large enough yet to give good shade. If you plan to stay on the beach all day like we do, shade is absolutely neccessary. Most people on the beach were turning chairs upside down to make shade structures around them. We joked and said that it looked like people were setting up forts. I hope the resort gets the hint and decides to purchase umbrellas or cabannas for the beach. The food is average. The best specialty restaraunts are the Gourmet Restaraunt and the Mexican Restaraunt. They were both very good. It is a pain to eat at these restaraunts because you have to make a reservation. The only way to do that is to go the day before and stand in a long line. The rooms were nice. Fully equipped with all you need (iron, ironing board, hair dryer, frig with drinks and a liquor dispenser). When we arrived to our room, the water that was in the frig was opened and half gone, but they brought fresh bottles of water. The bed was extremely hard and very uncomfortable. I had read this in previous reviews and wondered how hard could it be. Well, it's true. I got a massage one day at the spa (it's extra, but well worth the money). I did the Renova Combo Massage. It was 80 minutes for $110.00 usd. It was so awesome. The only complaint that I had at the spa is that you can hear the outside noise while in your massage room so at times it was a little distracting. They have nightly entertainment, but we did not enjoy it at all. I wish that they had other entertainment for the evenings because if you do not enjoy their shows (and we did not), there is nothing else availble.

The service was excellent, the food was delicious, (we found the buffets better than the restaurants) the rooms were gorgeous and very clean, always neat and nicely decorated with swan towels and chocolates.

I truly cannot complain about one thing! We are all in our 20's/early 30's and take it from us anyone can have a great time there. The shows at night time at the resort were always good, there are bars everywhere, and if you want to party go to Playa Del Carmen (we did every night) and go to the Blue Parrott and the Mambo Cafe. Obviously you have to pay but it is cheap and well worth it....we had the time of our lives at these two places. The Riu Tequila disco was average....but not worth going to everynight! We also met some amazing people on our trip from Texas (Shawn, Austin, Cody, Junior) most people in general were from Texas and we made some great friends, the guests were all very friendly! We also made friends with some staff members and they were all a lot of fun. I will never go to another resort again because it was perfect! P.S.

The grounds are beautiful! Extremely clean and well kept. The hotel decor is just like that in it's name... fit for a palace. To start off we had our room changed. Although our first room was gorgeous, it was facing the hotel next door. We went down to the front desk and asked for a pool facing room. Karla helped us out and was able to put us in a pool/fountain facing room at no extra charge. Beautiful (Karla rocks!!). Food: Ok. We mostly ate at the buffet, and the selection is pretty good. It's aimed to please American taste buds, so you're not going to find any ridiculously exotic items. We tried only two of the theme restaurants: Chili's, a beach-front restaurant, and Oliver's. Both had good food. We never got sick...Honestly though, who goes to Mexico for a gourmet experience? Beach & pool: Amazing! Pool lounge chairs aren't that hard to find... the beach is much nicer to lay on anyways, and there were always chairs on the beach. I read about the lack of shade on the beach, but some guests propped the extra chairs up creating a pretty decent umbrella effect. The water is awesome! Shopping: Ok. If you're into shopping, \"5th Ave.\" is a 5 minute taxi ride for $5 US, or it could be a 30 minute walk - all the way through a nice privately owned neighborhood. There are plenty of shops, all offering the same sorts of mechandise. Prices are competitive and there are shops where you can bargain for some deals. Finicky eaters rejoice: you can find a McDonald's, Subway, and other American restaurants in this area. Entertainment: As three 20something girls, we found there was always something going on. During the day, the staff host activities (water aerobics, soccer, dancing, darts, etc.). There are shows every night at 9:45 following a kids show. Some shows were really good. A few were not as polished. One show had a bit with fire breathing... very impressive & well done!! Another was a Circus theme; again, very impressive! ...and there are things to do afterwards (for those who claim there is nothing to do). The entertainment staff invited us to go clubbing with them after the shows and offered up plenty of opportunities to check out the night life. Service: Amazing!

We had a wonderful vacation overall, but here are some more specific bits of information: Food: If you keep in mind that you are not there for the food, you will not be disappointed. The breakfast buffet was great, plenty of choices (healthy and not-so-healthy) but everything was delicious. Lunch buffet was decent, I survived on a lot of salads, fruit, chicken, french fries, and ice cream (was to die for!!!) but there is much for the more adventurous as well. Only hit the dinner buffet once, it was decent. The a la carte restaurants: Chili's Steakhouse was okay, not great. Agave, the Mexican, was pretty good. Sir Oliver's, the gourmet, was FANTASTIC!! Go right at noon to make reservations for the next two nights or you will wait in line. Never got to the Japanese or Brazilian (heard many say the Brazilian was not very good.) Pool: Beautiful, big, great water temps. Never had trouble getting lounge chairs, but my fiances uncle went out at 8:30 every morning and got 4 chairs for us. Didn't seem like it would be too bad even if you didn't get outside until 9 or 10. Bring a high SPF. I am Cuban and tan very easily but I had to constantly reapply my SPF 30 (mostly because it was sweating off.) The weather was very humid but at least it was sunny, with the occasional afternoon sprinkle. Beach: Very pretty, good size, beautiful water, calm and clear. Definitley take advantage of the free kayaking, paddle boats, snorkels, etc... (although most who snorkeled saw almost nothing, but at least its free!) Rooms: very pretty, beds were hard but not too bad. We left 2 dollars each day for maids and got cute towel animals and lots of extra water in our mini-fridge. My only real complaint is the NOISE. The floors in the hall and rooms are all marble and the walls are thin, so you can hear EVERYTHING! Hopefully you wil not be staying next to a screaming baby or \"active\" couple... you can hear it all! Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Be very nice and polite at check-in (Which was a breeze by the way) and you might get upgraded, we did! Be nice and polite in general, the staff is very kind and sweet and polite, no need to be rude and demanding. Fitness Center was pretty decent but got really hot so its hard to stay in there for too long. If you go into town, a great restaurant is \"The Glass Bar\" and \"Media Luna\" both excellent. THe best bar is the Blue Parrot, tons of fun, very beachy and cool with swings instead of bar stools. 5th avenue, the main drag in Playa is well worth the 5 dollar, 3 minute cab ride.

My husband and finally after 3 nights of restless sleep, even after having a few drinks, took the pads off the chairs on the balcony and put them under the bottom sheet, which helped but was still not comfortable.

Besides the beautiful buildings, extremely clean rooms, beautiful grounds, beach and pool - the service was unbelievable! Every single employee we met was friendly and had a smile. We were treated like a king and a queen at the Palace. Thanks to Carlos who always has a smile and brought my husband an entire bowl of olives when our waiter did not understand English for olive and went to ask Carlos for help. Room/check-in: At first, we had a room on the 3rd floor with a balcony that was enclosed. When you sat down, you could not see out. We asked at the front desk and were told that we could switch the next day. Sure enough, by 12 they were already moving our luggage into a beautiful courtyard view room with an open railing balcony - room 2096. (the prior room was 3070). This side of the hotel which is to the right if the beach is at your back has shade on the balcony most of the day. The beds are extremely hard, and I don't usually complain about that - it is my ONLY complaint about this hotel. They did try to make it softer for us by adding some blankets under the sheets which helped a little. If your toilet backs up, remember Mexican resorts cannot handle paper in the toilet system. They ask that you dispose of the paper in the waste basket, that is why you may have heard of toilets not flushing. The other review with the toilet brush is total bogus - that is toilet santizer that they use when they clean the bathroom. Food: This place blows away any other AI we have been to. The food ranged from the ordinary salads and hamburgers to frog legs and brussel sprouts! The food art was stunning and the presentation of the food was as pretty as a picture. Please take my word for it that anyone who says there is not enough to eat here is loco! There was always guacamole and some of the usuals, but every single meal had different entrees and something new to try. I am still having guacamole withdrawals! The French restaurant Sir Oliver's was romantic and beautiful - they had rose petals on our table for our anniversary. During our first meal after just arriving, we were in the buffet and Stephanie - one of the hostesses, came up to us and asked which al a carte restaraunts we wanted to book (amazing, she knew we were new). Since my husband loves buffets, we only chose the French. A few of the entrees were not labeled and you did not know what it was, but we just asked. Never got sick for 9 days, ate our Pepto before every meal. Drinks: They will make them as strong as you like - sometimes they even handed my husband the bottle of rum! We did bring our bubba keg and saw others with them - no problem for them to fill them. The liquor dispensers in the room are nice to have too, but we were not in the room much to use them. Every night in the courtyard, the hotel had a champagne station set up with various types of champagne to try. One night it was champagne and melon liquor mixed, very tasty. Beach/pool: The pool was large, very warm and clean. The pool bar was a fun place to hang out and the daily water activities were a blast. The guy who does the water aerobics gets the crowd going and anyone who has seen him will know why ;-) I had concerns about the beach due to the erosion pictures I saw. NOT A PROBLEM! There is a huge beach on top of the concrete retaining wall and then another beach below right by the water. The water is the most incredible blue and was very calm to swim in. Many people were using the watersports and it was fun to watch them. We did snorkel near the beach and saw some small fish. NEVER a problem to get a chair on the beach, but not much shade so be careful. It is a new place, trees are still growing in. The pool chairs were always available, though you may not have had a \"prime\" location near the pool or by the water view, in 9 days we never had a problem getting a chair. The moms with their babies in the pool were very happy, the pool was very warm. We have been to some places were the pool was so cold we could not even enjoy it - not the case here. Grounds: The gardens and flowers are very nice and like you have heard before, there was not a bug or piece of garbage lying anywhere. The only time we saw garbage was when the local birds stole sugar packets and then were eating them, fun to watch! There is a very small pool - about 5 feet across and a small play area near the Chili's grill by the pool for the littlest guests. Inside & outside: Will take your breath away. The beautiful chandeliers, marble floors, huge oil paintings and luxurious furniture is truly a treat. There is a gift shop inside the lobby and also a jewelry store. Outside, below the front entrance is a \"pharmacy\" which has basic medicines and also souveniers (I don't think a lot of people know it is there), it is located next to the medical office. Local vendors will come to the courtyard, they were much nicer and not as pushy as what we have had in the past at other resorts and we enjoyed watching and talking with them. Xel-Ha was like swimming in a giant aquarium and well worth every penny. We will go back there again next time we visit. We would not go to Playa again during the day - it was just too hot. We think that a trip later in the day when the sun starts to go down would be far more enjoyable. One final tip, print a picture of the local currency and become familiar with what the exchange rate is before you go. This threw us off a few times the first couple of days. I can honestly say this was as close to the \"perfect trip\" as it gets. What made it so outstanding for us was the quality of the people that work at this resort and the pride they have in the food and services they provide. We tipped well and often and were happy to do it! If you choose this hotel, you WILL have a trip of a lifetime. I would be happy to answer any questions or share further pics if anyone is interested.

Ignore the Bad Review...\u201d", "Author": "fieldsfam", "ReviewID": "UR5391231", "Content": "It was amazing, as I expected. We had stayed at the other RIU Palace just down the street, the last two time we visited... in 2002 and in 2005. We loved that one as well, but decided last year, when we saw this one being built... that we'd try it the next time we visited. So that we did. We were delayed an hour due to our flight was detoured around Alberto, but when we arrived, all was perfect the rest of the trip. The staff are so service oriented, and they obviously love their jobs. Our room was spotless, and I swear they cleaned our room a few times a day, without our ever putting the 'Clean The Room' sign on the door. They would also stock our fridge without our asking. One evening we were getting dressed to go to dinner, and my husband accidentally knocked off a corona bottle (i.e. broken glass) on the tile floor in the bathroom. As it was late, we simply brushed it aside temporarily and continued to get dressed, and went to dinner. When we came back from dinner... it had been cleaned up for us, again without us informing them of the broken glass. (how DO they know???)... and also every night when we returned from dinner, our sheets had been turned down, and chocolate kisses had been left. Needless to say, we left they a huge tip. It was more than we expected. We stayed from June 11th - 15th, which wasn't long enough, but alas we had to get home to our children. They are too young to enjoy that place just yet. Next time they will definitely be going with us. Beside of Chilis, in the resort... is a small area for smaller kids, a small kiddie pool and playground. The other RIU didn't have that, or I didn't see it. This one was decorated much the same, but seemed to have more marble and tile ornate decor. Everytime I walked down the corridors, I was amazed at how much detailed hand work went into that place. Also, the last morning we were there, we had went down to the beach and noticed that there was a bunch of brown seaweed on the white sand (normally not there, must have washed up after Alberto had passed), and they had a few of their groundskeepers RAKING this stuff up and digging holes and burying it. Why???? when it would be washed back out once the tides changed... our guess was simply to keep the guests happy that the beaches were so clean. Heck, they even raked the sand before we got up each morning. What I like about the RIUs there is that you can never really figure out how in the world they keep everything so coordinated, you never see the workers coming to work or leaving, yet there are hundreds of them. They are always perfectly dressed. We have yet to figure out how they do it all. One night we ate at the International Buffet. They had carved ornate designs in watermellons, and had even created a bouquet of what appeared to be real roses. Upon a closer look... the roses were also carved out of watermellon. It's the attention to detail that you have to just sit back and take in, and that makes the whole trip just filled with wonder. And I just have to point out that I had read a review on here, before we left... that was all about this toilet bowl thing beside the toilet, and how it had this colored water in it, and how that person was just so upset over this... that the minute we checked into our room, I immediately went into the bathroom to check that out. I laughed my butt off!!! My toiltet as well had this. And so did our friends, staying in a different room... HELLOOOOO.... it is a cleaner/disinfectant that is supposed to be that color! Good lord people, if you are going to complain about something, make sure you know what you are complaining about. I noticed that in all of the public bath facilities at the resort, the same cleaner was in that toilet brush holder, so anyone who read that... ignore it, and go and enjoy your nice clean sanitied toiltets. The ONLY thing that was a negative for me... being fair skinned, is that shade was at a minimal. The transplanted palm trees haven't had time to grow good large fronds yet I guess... so each morning I would find a spot of shade, put my chair in it and follow it as the sun shifted. At high noon, I was pretty much considered a 'tree hugger', literally. But I slathered on my 60 sunscreen and somehow managed to avoid getting burned the entire trip.... so all is well. The food was amazing, the drinks even better. Staff very friendly. We had no complaints at all other than we wished we had more time there. Next time we will.

I enjoyed laying on the beach as well. Tipping - I would definitely bring USD$100 - USD$150 for tipping, if you can go to the bank before you leave and get all singles that is your best bet. The staff doesn\u2019t expect it but they very much appreciate the tips. The staff really bust there butts and do deserve it. We saw a party of 6 at the Mexican Restaurant and the waiter was taking pictures of the group and really making sure they had a good time and they left him nothing, when they left he looked on the table to see if they had left a tip and looked so disappointed that they did not. At the gourmet restaurants we usually left between USD$5-$7 and the buffet USD$3-$4. For lunch usually USD$2. Housekeeping we usually left USD$3-$5 depending how well the room was cleaned the day before. We had the same 2 housekeepers. Also left 20 pesos for the person who turns the bed down. And last but certainly not least TIP THE BARTENDERS. Honestly these people work long hard days and deserve anything you can give them!! Also an added perk is you are staying at a Palace resort so you can go to any of the other Riu's that are in Playacar there are 5 others. One of the couples we met suggested we go on a Riu Bar Hop, and we did that one night. That was a lot of fun! You can also walk to 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen within 20 minutes or take a cab for USD$5. Souvenirs are MUCH cheaper there, and definitely bargain with them. We did 2 excursions while we were there. We swam with the dolphins at Delphinus, which was amazing! You are in the water with them for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. We also did Xel-Ha snorkeling, this was also a lot of fun, you see some incredible fish! Side not if you plan on doing Xel-Ha be sure to purchase Bio-Degradable sun screen. We had a wonderful time at the Riu Palace Riveria Maya and we can't wait to return!! We met some really great people and just had blast!

We were very pleased with our trip. We found the service at the hotel to be outstanding for the most part. I will begin with a few things we were not pleased with. The first night we were there we had a problem with the drain in our bathtub. We called the front desk and reported the problem three times before they sent a maintenance person (on our third day) to fix the problem. The beds have the most uncomfortable mattresses I have ever slept on. After several drinks it really didn't matter though! The room was also very hot and humid. Aside from those minor inconveniences the trip was terrific. We found the staff to be very friendly. The pool is gorgeous. We walked to the other Riu properties and found that the Riu Palace had the best grounds. The beach and water are absolutely beautiful. Be sure to specify the liquor that you want in your drinks. They have everything you just have to ask for it. Be sure to make reservations for the specialty restaurants. The food at the dinner buffet is not very good. Try Agave and Sir Oliver's.

I would definitely suggest this hotel for couples and families. I would not suggest it for young single people who love to go out and have a good time. We loved almost everything about the hotel. The food was great. We ate at the buffet every morning and it had a great variety of fruits and good food. The buffet also offered a variety of good food at night. The best part was being able to sit outside in a cafe table by the courtyard. We did not care so much for Sir Olivers. It was supposedly the best restaurant and the hardest to get reservations to. The Japanese restaurant was great and the Brazilian and Chilis were okay. Overall, for an all-inclusive, the food was great! The service was decent. The people were all pretty friendly. Make sure you bring money to tip, they do work hard and do deserve tips. We had no problems with the service except for the reservations to restaurants. It was always a long wait to reserve your seat and hardly any of the restaurants supposedly had availabilities. When we would go to the restaurants, some tables were empty. I feel like they need a better system with the restaurants. I wanted to feel relaxed, not looking at my watch to rush and try to reserve restaurants. The pool and beach were amazing. You would go out of the hotel and step onto the courtyard. I absolutely loved the courtyard. It reminded me of Mediterranean cities. You walk past beautiful fountains onto the pool. The beach was right next to the pool and it was breathtaking! Overall, our experience was wonderful. We met some amazing people on our trip and had a great experience with our new friends. We laughed, swam, played sports, drank, and ate. You really can't beat that for a long and relaxing experience.

Stayed at the Riu Palace Riviera from June 3 to June 10, 2006. When we arrived at this hotel we were given an option. For some reason they over booked certain suites, etc. They gave us the option of staying in the best suite at a resort (Riu Yucatan) which was located about 3-5 min away from the Riu palace riviera maya and also presented us with $200 to stay at the Yucatan for one night. When we were to return the next day to Riu Palace R. Maya they would upgrade us to an ocean view suite. Since i wanted to experience a different resort to compare, I agreed to stay for ONE night at the Yucatan. Once Again, THIS WAS MY DECISION. The hotel was extremely polite and let me make the decision. Had i decided against this deal, somebody else would have been offered it. So we spent a night at the Yucatan. Yucatan had an amazing beach, great food, but room stunk like mold. I shouldnt say the entire room, but mainly our living room. The couch had a horrific scent. It was at times unberable. No big deal to me, since i only wanted to use the room to sleep. The guy at the front desk \"Alex Rios\" ( i think that was his name) was the ruddest person in the entire world. But regardless, i didnt let him ruin my day. Next day at the Riu Palace R. Maya, i was welcomed like a king. Great suite, full fridge, clean rooms, no mold scent, great bed, amazing view, phenomenol bathroom, etc, etc. I cant even explain how great our room and service was. I am surprised i wasnt greeted by a gorgeous mexican feeding me strawberries and fanning me down. It was just perfect.. The pool is one of the best i have been to. Plenty of space, tons of chairs, clean towels, lots of drinks, lots of sexy people, lots of couple, hardly any kids. Activities throughout the day were plentiful...soccer, beach volleyball, pool volleyball, ping pong, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc...i cant recall all the activites..there were plenty. i was concerned about the beach after reading the reviews. I was worried about the white fence and all the other negative things i read. People are crazy. The beach was outstanding. Sand was like walking on a cloud. Water at times rough with waves, but for the most part, amazing. I walked up and down the coast line every night. It was one of the better beaches compared to the resorts within a 3-4 mile stretch. The rui palace mexico and the riu yucatan do have a slight edge on palace r. maya for there length of beach. Food was good, not great. But personally, i dont vacation for food. I vacation for sun, beach, and pool. Dont want to have a full belly with the shirt off. Quick run down, brazilian was the worst. Buffet was good. Steak house was mediocre. Sir Oliver great. Didnt eat at the other ones, because i enjoyed playa de carmen's restaurants two of the nights. Simply an incredible vacation. Bartenders especially Rene (evening lounge bartender) are superb, staff friendly, riu animacion (entertainment staff) fun to be around, cleaner then one can possibly imagine, comfortable and relaxing... Oh, and playa de carmen is great. If you are single visit playa de carmen. Women gorgeous and fun to socialize with. No comment about the men, because well i love women. hehe..

Look no further \u2013 the Riu Palace Riveria Maya is paradise\u2026you will not be disappointed!! Let me start of by saying anyone who has noteworthy complaints about this resort has to be insane! You are put upon a pedestal as soon as you walk through the front doors and absolutely spoiled rotten with people waiting on you hand and foot \u2013 and always with a huge smile on their face. My husband and I vacationed at the Palace for seven nights at the end of May along with another couple and had an absolute blast! CHECK IN: Quick and easy \u2013 the front desk staff were super friendly and eager to meet all our requests. We were on vacation celebrating our wedding anniversary and mentioned that to the front desk and were given a \u2018complimentary\u2019 upgrade overlooking the courtyard fountains. We also requested we be close to our friends room- and they upgraded them and put us directly side by side. {keep in mind we checked in on a Wed \u2013 there was a noticeable difference between the amount of people staying through the week \u2013vs.- the weekend\u2026so the availability of free upgrades and rooms side by side \u2018may\u2019 have been harder to score if we checked in on Fri/Sat/Sun}. HOTEL: From the moment you walk in you will be blown away by the Palace\u2019s beauty. This place was for sure designed with elegance in mind \u2013 there is marble, ceramic tile, etc. everywhere you turn. The detail that was put into the Palace gives it a definite WOW factor. When you step out into the courtyard it is absolutely breathtaking with all the stunning fountains, pools and palm trees. This place was immaculate. There were constantly people cleaning \u2013 every corner of this resort sparkles. ROOMS: The rooms are big and spacious. There is a his/hers sink in the bathroom along with a hydro jet tub \u2013 which is very relaxing and romantic. Granted the beds are firm \u2013 but one quick call to the front desk and they will bring down some padding to help ensure a restful nights sleep. There is a sitting area in each room \u2013 which my husband found useful since he could relax, watch ESPN and drink a Corona while he waited for me to get ready for the evening. The mini bar was always stocked with beer, soda and plenty of bottled water. There is also that awesome liquor dispenser in the room and if you would like a bottle of something else\u2026again, just ask and you will receive. POOL: WOW! Where do I start\u2026the Riu Palace Riveria Maya added a special touch when designing their pool area: ohh my favorite \u2013the chase loungers built into the pool for your basking in the sun enjoyment, there are also tables built into the pool to sit, relax and drink with your friends! The infinity pool was dazzling with the water spilling over its sides and into the pool below. Oh yeah, I cannot forget to mention the pool bar that kept us supplied with any kind of refreshing beverage you like\u2026ask for an extra shot (or two) on top of your drink and you got it! BEACH: Breath taking, stunning, gorgeous\u2026take a look at the pictures I posted \u2013 they speak for themselves. As far as walking on the beach-- we walked a good half hour down the beach with no problems (\u2026and still no problems- just got tired and needed a drink refill so turned around and headed back to the Palace.) ACTIVITIES: There always was something going on at the Palace \u2013 volley ball to water aerobics and bingo in the pool. Dance lessons, darts and horse shoes on the beach. They also have free non- motorized water sports {wind-surfing, sailing, boogie boards and snorkeling}. You can rent jet ski\u2019s, go scuba diving, and more for a minimal charge. At night there is always a show in the courtyard \u2013 plus if you need the club scene you can venture down the road to the sister Riu\u2019s nightclub. FOOD: Was excellent. I am an extremely picky eater and I continuously found plenty to eat. I always started my day with a mimosa at the delicious breakfast bar (more like a feast than a bar I guess) \u2013 with made to order omelets, french toast, fresh fruit, croissants\u2026hungry yet? All of the ala-cart restaurants where excellent \u2026ok so we were not big fans of the Brazilian one- but the rest were top notch \u2013 especially the gourmet restaurant. We celebrated our anniversary night there and they hooked us up with a special cake and bottles of wine to take back to the room. There is also the buffet which serves up different selections every night \u2013 the food was beyond plentiful and picky eaters can surely find several things to their likings here. Also, if you are like me \u2013 I am a huge fresh-salsa fan- it\u2019s excellent here and can be found at all times of the day. \uf04a OVERVIEW: This has to be one of the most gorgeous places to stay and was worth every cent. I certainly hope my review has helped with your vacation decision. Do not waste your time listening to the people who complain about all the \u2018petty\u2019 things. This place will not let you down\u2026just remember ... you are in Mexico, on a beautiful beach with all the food and drinks you could ask for!

My girlfriend and i agonized over which resort to visit on our vacation this month, and used trip advisor extensively to come to a decision. Initially we were leaning towards the Riu in Los Cabos, because of the consistent weather - but i'm glad we didn't. So we came across a ridiculously good deal for the Riu Maya and after checking some feedback on this site - decided to take the plunge. So here goes my review: Food: Overall very good. The best was breakfast and the mexican restaurant. The lunch gets repetive by about day 3. Personally i find alot of the desserts kind of strange - i'd prefer to see more familiar stuff. I would have liked to have seen an Italian restaurant instead of the brazilian. The Gourmet restaurant was really good as well. Now - this is where the 'almost' perfect comes in. On the last night of our trip (thankfully!), i got a vicious stomach bug that seemed to creep on almost immediately after the sunday night buffet. My girlfriend and i ate almost the same stuff, except i had some of the calamari and mahi mahi - i can't say for certain but be careful! Room: Awesome awesome awesome. Great view, extremely comfortable - the jacuzzi tubs was great - used it a few times. The only thing is because in Playa Del Carmen there is a law that you can't build higher than 3 stories, resorts end up being very spread out horizontally speaking. So in our case, that equalled a fairly lengthy walk each day to the pool / beach. Not really a big deal, just a minor annoyance if you have to sneak back to the room for something. Service: Awesome awesome awesome. No question. However i read that if you leave tips in your room expect a 'notch up' for the rest of the week. So on the first day i left a $5 tip in the room, but we didn't get any towel animals or anything the rest of the week. I guess it totally depends. Also, it seemed that there were 2 groups of people working the room - there was housekeeping, and then a seperate team handling the minibars. Pool: The pool was great for lounging and enjoying a pina colada. It was always very clean. The only thing i thought would have been neat would be some sort of lazy river... Beach: The beach was extremely good as well. They have an area roped off that is primo for swimming. The water is turquoise and the bottom is a soft white sand. Nightlife: We spent most nights relaxing in the Lirico bar watching the show of the evening. The first thing i would comment on is the house band. The band was ok but the singer had a bit of a shrill voice that got tiring on the ears. They are also at a bit of a disadvantage as the way the room is constructed they are perched up on very high loft above the stage - very strange. Following a few songs, a surprisingly funny host would come out and then present the daily awards to the guests (for activities like bingo etc...). The shows tended to be a bit on the campy side but there were some good ones - in particular the Mayan Show and the Magic show. Weather: This was one of my biggest concerns, going at the beginning of hurricane and rainy season i was worried that we would have 7 glorious days of rain and clouds. To further my concern as our trip neared the weather.com 10 day forecast was looking grim with thunderstorms almost every day. Not the case at all - and i know you've probably read this before in other reviews but i don't recall hearing one rumble of thunder the whole trip. There were 2 days that had rain, but it was off & on one day, and very brief the other. One word of warning for the fair skinned - be VERY CAREFUL. Even with your standard SPF 30 sun tan lotion a sunburn creeps up on you, and they don't protect against UVA very well - just UVB - and not to get into a science lesson but UVA rays are the ones that do the most damage. The best you can do is bring lots of lotion (don't buy down there - it's pricey) and reapply every 2 hours.

The upper tier was never occupied but you could take loungers down to the lower area. The pool was great too. I was a little worried about the reviews where people talked about no loungers being available but that was a never a problem. We usually didn't make it to the pool until around 11 and there were always loungers available. They weren't always directly at pool side, but by the end of day, we could always move up as people left for the day. Didn't see any instances where people had claimed the lounger and didn't return all day. We also had a couples massage in the spa which was terrific. The prices were comparable with what we'd normally pay for a massage and it felt great. The only thing I didn't care for was the nightly entertainment. I thought it was a little cheesy and could have done without. I would have preferred a nightclub. Regardless, the plaza was a nice place to hang out in the evenings.

We had a wonderful time. Since I read all the reviews for two weeks before we went, I thought I would add my two cents! We booked our trip through a travel agent and Vacation Express. If I had any complaints, it would be that no one told us we would only get a bag of pretzels to eat. Our flight left at about 8:50 a.m. and we didn't arrive at our hotel until about 2:00 p.m. Our room was not ready when we arrived. We had to wait about a half hour to get our information and bracelets. We were then able to go about the hotel and get something to eat. At that time the only restaurant open is Chili's by the pool. The Sports Bar is open 24 hours and has hamburgers, hot dogs and sandwiches that you can heat in the microwave. After we ate something, we went back to the front desk to see if our room was ready. I think it was about 3:30 at that point. It took at least another 15 minutes to get our room. Some of the people at the front desk are not very friendly. Most people that are checking in are very tired, hungry and have been travelling all day. It would be nice if they were a little friendlier, but oh well, not a big deal. I will say that this is one of the cleanest hotels that I have ever stayed at. These people are always cleaning. Inside and out. Our room was always cleaned usually by 12:00 noon. We usually had a little towel animal which made us smile when we came in from the pool. Every night our bed was turned down with a chocolate kiss on the pillow. We always had plenty of towels and someone was either knocking on our door or calling from the front desk to see if we needed more. They even brought chocolate covered strawberries the first night we were there. The beds are hard and I did ask the front desk for a \"mattress pad\" but was told there weren't any in the hotel. No problem, the lounge chairs at the pool are very comfortable and I caught up on my sleep there. Food: The food for the most part was good. They try to have a wide variety. I am sure it is not easy to please everyone, but they do a good job. We ate at the Mexican (Agave), Chili's and Sir Oliver's for the ala carte. Sir Oliver's was very good, the other two were just okay. The rest of the time we ate at the buffet. They have a different theme every night and we always found something we liked.

Rooms: Very neat, beds were a little hard but if you call and ask the maids will put down pads and soft blankets to make them softer. The mini bar is always stocked(because it's not like you don't drink by the pool all day anyway). The is also liquor in the room: bicardi, vodka, jose quervo and a brandy. I call and requested a bottle of baileys be brought and it was in the room in 5 minutes. The bath room are all marble with a high pressure shower head and a jaccuzi bath. The Pool: Nice, swim up bar, the only complaint is they don't play music outside of water aerobics. But for the majority of the crowd there no music was a good thing. There are alot of things to do at the hotel during the day from beach volley ball to bingo by the pool. The also have free no motorized water sports. Snorkeling is offer for free at the scuba center on the beach. Food: For a All-inclusive resort the food was amazing, much better then all the other hotels, I am a very picky eater and I found something to eat at every meal, not only did I find something I really enjoyed the food. They have several resturaunts: Brazillian, Japanese(dont let the sushi scare you there is plenty of other food to eat), Steak house, Mexican, French Gourmet( my Favorite) and a buffet that changes themes every night. Night life: We tryed a little bit of everything, if you want to just dance and drink for free go over to the RIU Tequilla there is a club and it is open until 2, its fun and its FREE. Its a 5 minute walk or a 2-3 dollar cab ride. There is also several clubs in Playa del carmen. My favorite was the blue parrot, for 6dollars you got in and got 2 beers. the mixed drinks however are not so good of deal. There is also a Carlos and Charlies, Senior Frogs, Mambo Cafe, and several others, -if you want to go to Cancun for the bar hoppers tours it is 74 dollars for all you can drink and transportation to and from cancun, cover for three clubs and transportaion to the clubs.

All of the alacart resteraunts where great except for aguava (the mexican resteraunt). The buffet was great with something for everyone. I had champagne mimosa for breakfast every morning. room service was great (except for the nachos). This resort is amazingly clean! I tipped well ($3 to $7 per day) and received great service. All rooms have hydro jet tubs and the beds are firm but very comfortable. I have been to playacar twice, puerto plata once, punta cana once, etc... and this was the best resort I have every stayed at. The beach was beautiful. I walked down the beach and the riu palace riviera maya had the best beach of ANY of the resorts on the strip. There is one picture posted on this sight that shows metal bars sticking up between the sand and the barrier wall and that picture is VERY misleading! The metal bars are about 400 yards down (about 3 resorts down) that is being built/repaired. You can not even see what the picture is of without walking 15 minutes.

I will make it short and sweet and hopefully helpful... Background: I traveled with a group of 4 people (couples) who are all in their 20s. Hotel: Beautiful, have no idea what anybody could complain about. Rooms: Yes, the beds are hard, but I still managed to get a great nights sleep the entire trip (my friends however did not). Maid service wasn't the best, only got one towel animal, but who cares. Food: I loved the breakfast and dinner buffet. Lunch buffet was really bad, but that would be my only complaint about the food. Excursions: Here is how this works. When you get to the airport and find where to take the van to the hotel a man will give you a card with a name of someone to meet the next morning who will help you choose your excursions and book your van for the way home. Great I thought. The next morning at 9am I received a call from Mario (he calls himself Super Mario) to remind me to come down and meet him. That was annoying, but fine. Anyway, we met with Mario and we signed up for the ATV Jungle Tour and Scuba diving. The Scuba diving was really bad, but please note that I have been diving for 10 years and the reefs have been destroyed by the hurricane. I talked to other divers and they said they had been on much better dives than the one I went on, so that is good! The ATV Jungle Tour is a must!!! It was so much fun. Tip: Where sneakers if you plan on driving the ATV. Mario failed to mention this to us and we were the only ones in flip flops. So I highly recommend that. The only other problem I had was never recieving the phone call to let me know what time the van to pick us up was. Mario never followed through and when we approached him he really did very little to try and fix it (until the hotel got involved). After a very frustrating 45 min. it all worked out. Overview: This was honestly the most beautiful place I have ever stayed. My complaints have nothing to do with the hotel, I just wanted to make sure people had some extra advice when dealing with Mario and his staff of workers.

We tried booking with various travel agents and were not happy with the services, so I decided to booked my own hotels, airfare, etc. The first week we stayed at the Barcelo (May 14 to 21, 2006) and loved it, for the second week we were to stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya (a 5+ resort) (May 21 to 28, 2006) for our official honeymoon week. Our stay at the Riu was the worst experience ever! 1. At check in the reception staff member was rude. We indicated that we were honeymooners (had all the paperwork) and the staff member said \"we are full\" turned her back to us and left us hanging. We didn't get a room upgrade or even a gift as stated in the books. The room that we got --! Riu claims that they \u201clove\u201d honeymoons\u2026.we\u2019ll these honeymoons do not like the Riu. 2. Bed is hard as a rock. 3. Rooms are noisy - at 12:30 AM our neighbors alarm clock was going off for 45 minutes till the hotel turned it off. Then at 1:30 AM our neighbors came into their room yelling and screaming. Then at 8:00 AM another alarm clock was going off for 1/2 hour till the hotel turned it off. The walls are very thin! 4. There is a toilet brush sitting in brown water next to your toilet (gross! See the photo) 5. There was only one towel in our room at check in. 6. The hotel safe --. First, you need a key that you have to keep with you all the time and the safe is located at the bottom of the closet so it is hard to get into. 7. The al-la cart restaurants have a very limited menu. 8. The pool is very small along with the swim up bar. 9. The beach is ok, other resorts have much larger beaches. 10. The theatre is very small (well it really isn\u2019t a theatre but a bar)\u2026.some guest have to sit out side so if the weather if crummy then you won\u2019t be staying for the show. 11. Merchants sell stuff at night in the court yard\u2026.and the vendors are a little too pushy for me. 12. There is no soap dish in the washroom so we used the ashtray. 13. The hallways are very dark and gloomy. 14. No snorkeling at this resort. 15. No phone directory on the telephone so there is no easy reference on even how to call front desk. I tried calling front desk by pressing 0\u2026.no luck\u2026turned out you dial 9. 16. There is no phone book in the room. 17. Fire alarm was going off 5 times as we tried to have a siesta 18. First plate that I picked up at the buffet was completely dirty underneath. 19. We had to put our own stickers on our luggage at check in. 20. Ashtrays throughout the complex are dirty with butts. 21. The bar fridge in your room is very noisy 22. Did I mention that you can hear other guests going to the washroom while in your room. 23. The maids are very loud as they talk to each other while cleaning the rooms. Hard when you want to sleep in. This all in one night at the Riu. The next morning we complained to our Funjet representative and ask that we be transferred back to the Barcelo Tropical Beach.

I knew the weather was hot there but I thought and she thought that she could handle it. But she couldn't handle the humidity. It was hard on us but it was unbearable for my mother. The hotel does NOT have any humidity control device so the room was very damp. It's surprising that 4 star hotel doesn't have any devices that controls humidity in the hotel. The bed sheets felt wet. Also the rooms didn't have much noise isolation. We could hear everything in the halls and rooms adjacent to us. The walls are thin and since the hotel doesn't have any carpeting, noise travels very well. If you are sensitive sleeper, DO NOT go to his hotel.

Our ages are 25 and 27 and have traveled frequently to Mexico over the years. Some all-inclusives I have stayed at in the past include Moon Palace, Riu Cancun, Sandals and some of the Occidental Resorts. Check in was a breeze with the great customer service of Carlos. We arrived in the mid afternoon on our shuttle bus with 5 other couples and were greeted immediately when entering the hotel. We were upgraded to a beautiful room with a spectacular view and did not pay anything extra. From my observation it pays to be respectful and have a great attitude because the other couples around us were quite crabby and rude which probably was due to long travel times but don't take this out on the front desk. Our luggage was taken care of right when we walked through the lobby doors and we received it about five minutes after getting to our suite. The hotel lobby is beautiful and makes a great impression when you first walk in. The hotel grounds are immaculate and are always being maintained through out the day. We did not have any musty smells in our room except for when we left the air conditioning off for most the day in our room and when we turned it back on. Fare warning keep the air running and you probably can avoid that problem! The maid service was not excellent but not bad by any means. We always had our room cleaned everyday no matter what time we ended up leaving the room (anywhere from 8:00 am \u2013 2:00 pm). We did have to ask for more towels a few times but it was probably more of our faults because we did not leave the dirty towels in the bath tub, ooops! Our dirty towels were still taken every time but they did not leave us new ones. No big deal \u2013 we just left some money and asked for more and problem solved! Refrigerator was stocked daily with no issues. Yes we did have an issue with the room keys not working at times but we would go down to the front desk and it would be corrected immediately. This problem did not occur all the time but only when you had to get in the room to use the bathroom because of too much rum :-) !! The pool is outstanding!! There is plenty of room in the pool for the entire resort. Probably Saturday was the busiest day because of two conventions being held but the pool never seemed overcrowded. We did walk down to the Riu Palace Mexico and thought the pool at our resort was much, much better! This was one of my worries when booking at this resort - it would be overcrowded in the pool especially the pool bar area.Yes the bar stools were usually taken but there was plenty of room to lounge around at the other pool tables and seats. People would come and go and there is always a chance to jump in. Now if you don\u2019t want to be around the pool bar then you will have absolutely no problem at all! We always found loungers around the pool most of the time and if there was none to be seen then we would just grab a lounger from the beach or also there were tables and chairs around the pool bar if it was not too busy. The beach was the most amazing blues as they always are in Playa. The retaining wall should not be an issue at all because you can always bring your loungers next to the water with no hassle. If you look at all the other resorts, Royal Hideaway, Riu Cancun, Le Blanc and most Cancun Resorts for example, always have some sort of wall. Even when the tide came up during the early evening there was still plenty of room down by the ocean. The tide was probably high when the resort first opened in March but now has receded leaving enough room to walk the beach all the way to the Riu Palace Mexico. I did swim in the ocean but always towards the right side and had no issue with coral just soft white sand on the feet. Food was very good but not excellent which was to be expected at this all-inclusive. There was always plenty to choose from and did not have any complaints about the food but I am not a picky eater. Sorry I will not be much help on the specialty restaurants because we missed most our reservation times. Because of people like me you could probably show up 10-15 minutes after the seating and get in the restaurant. The only one we made was the Mexican Restaurant, which was good but just like eating at the buffet better because of selection. I did make reservations for a couple of the restaurants and only had to wait for about 10-15 minutes which just meant grabbing a drink at the lobby bar watching for the line to be gone then jumping in. Drinks were great, no complaints! I tried a little bit of everything and the bartenders will definitely go out of their way for you. We did bring singles down before hand and did tip our bartenders and always received excellent service from all.

Hence, now that I am back from my stay there, I thought it only be fitting that I write one. First of all, I'll give a little background about myself. I am 20 years old and stayed at the Riu Place with my parents (who are both 43 years old) and my younger brother. Riu Palace Riveira Maya is a great place to stay if you are a couple. Having come on the vacation with my family, it was nice, but if you are looking for a fun time drinking and socializing by the pool, I suggest you go with a group of friends or with your significant other. This is a very couple oriented resort. However, during our stay there were quite a few young infants and young children accompanying their parents. Checking in and out: The check in was okay. Not terrible. The girl we got at the front desk was very straight forward, laying out everything we needed to know. For instance ,she told us upfront about the cost of internet was $4/ 15 minutes and where we could eat that night, what was covered and anything that was at an additional cost. She wasn't super friendly, but not exactly rude. Let just say out of all our experiences with the staff. I'd rate the front desk the worst. *Don't let the front desk affect your overall impression of the resort though. The nice point abot the check in was while we were talking with the front desk, we were served drinks (a fresh juice with pineapple, mango, and orange!) We were only in the resort for about 3 minutes and were already recieving such treatment ( I did say that this reosrt was very guest oriented!) When we checked out, the front desk was not that great. The lady seemed rushed. Just taking our room access and towel cards and saying see you! I wasn't expecting much, maybe just a thanks and maybe asking how was our stay. My dad asked her whether the shuttles were going to pick us up at the front of the hotel and she was like I don't know (as if it was not in her job description) go call your tour provider. For those who read past reviews about tipping the front desk, I don't think it is necessary, save your tipping money for your servers and bartenders) The Rooms: The room was nice, clean and spacious. The interconnecting rooms were great. Unlike other places I stayed, The interconnecting rooms are not partition by a door through a wall. The rooms are facing one another with an additional wall on the outiside that connects the two rooms. I really liked the towel animals (we got 4 different animals during our 7 day stay). I found that housekeeping came by the room quite late in the day. Our family woke up at around 9:00 each day and had breakfast and went to the pool and beach. By our siesta time (2:00-2:30), the rooms were not made. This is the time the housekeeping staff came to do our rooms which was kind of awkward. But they were always courteous by knocking first and asking whether we wanted our room cleaned. Although, on the days we felt it was unecessary for them to do our rooms (because we wanted to nap). The came in after we left and did our beds (one day they left a hershey kiss on each of my brother and my double bed!) I thought that was a nice touch. The housekeeping staff also did other surprises like carve flowers our of the bar soap we opened (interesting but i loved their effort to try and make things special) Pool: As you can see from past reviews. Riu Palace Riveria Maya has a beautiful pool. Its two tiered and had places to sit and drink and the swim up bar was a favorite. The Food: This was the most important thing about the resort. My family are quite picky eaters so we wanted a resort that would be catering to our tastebuds. The breakfast and lunch buffets were good, a nice variety. To be honest after the third day, we got kind of tried of eating the same stuff. But the food was good. The dinner buffet: We ate there the first and last nite. They try and switch up the menu. Our server the first night was excellent ( we had to give him a nice tip!) He was friendlly and fun and was so efficent. Our plates were cleared off the table and he was ready to refill our beverages at all times! The rest of the servers were also good but I couldn't help compare them to Nicholas ( i think that was his name!) I suggest that everyone book the theme restaurants ( you can do that by the tables near the main bar in the lobby between 12-4) Come early as they do get booked up. My family was very impressed by the Japanese Restaurant (Yashima) and the Gourmet (Sir Olivers). Our server at Sir olivers was sooo good! The mexican was also quite good (I liked the shrimp and the margaritas). The Brazilian ( great soup, good is you like eating lots of meat ) and Chilis (steakhouse) was also okay. Overall i enjoyed all of the restaurants, some more than others but it was fun having a different place to eat each night. Entertainment: Pool side dancing, beach party on fridays. The theme shows every night were okay (some not that bad, some nights kind of lame). They have a small stage so the things they can do is limited. The live band that plays every night were excellent. The entertaniment crew (the animation group?) they were really energetic and their dancing was fun to watch (I don't think you can ask for more, and no they were not as terrible as some other reviews said.) Beach: Beautiful. Plenty of chairs (you don't need to wake up early to get one) The only thing that that was not that convenient is getting the equipment. Where the equipment is located opposite of where the we had to fill out this long waiver form asknowledging the risks (by chilis). Overall we had a great stay at the Riu Palace Riveria Maya.

For instance, the long hallways have a dampened musty smell, what you would expect from the tropics. However, the structure is a bit different than the Riu Palace Cabo which had rooms on one side and open air on the other. I often sat on my balcony which faced the water early morning and could see people running to put towels out at 6am. Then later I would see them in the lobby leaving for a bus trip for the day not even using the saved lounge chairs! I hate that part. But we (a party of four) never had a problem getting a good seat. The piano bar after dinner is a wonderful place to unwind, and the nightly shows are very entertaining. The courtyard is a great place to sit and enjoy a cocktail while you listen to Mariachis or other nightly entertainment as well. The Renova Spa was worth every penny. They were wonderful. The animation staff is also as much fun. This is one resort you will not regret doing the all-inclusive package on.

Never too packed, pull a chair down to wherever you want to sit, it is quiet and wonderful! Hammocks on the beach and drinks are brought to you there as well. Locals come up to you selling conch shells, starfish and jewelry. None of the ones that came up to us were pushy at all. Snorkel/Scuba \u2013 We went snorkeling on the all day trip to Cozumel and it was all day. A little too long for me and I think scuba diving would have been more fun. The reefs were not that colorful, but the fish, sting rays and barracuda were amazing to see. The water was really cold, so bring a drink change of clothes or bathing suit and a towel!! Food \u2013 The food was ok, some of it was not good at all, but there are a lot of options at the buffet. If you want a vacation all about food, go to France or Italy, not Mexico. Make reservations the first night you are there, if you book the late dinner you pretty much have the restaurant to yourself. Japanese I thought was really good, Brazilian was filling, the best part is the grilled pineapple. The Mexican was so so, not like the Mexican food we are used to. Drinks - They never skimped on alcohol when I had a drink. Bring some sort ot cup that keeps drinks cold, because it is hot and the drinks get hot fast on the beach or at the pool! Playa Del Carmen \u2013 You can walk into town, lots of shops, the vendors on the street can be really aggressive so be ready. You can take a five dollar cab ride into town as well. My favorite bars/club were Carlos and Charlie\u2019s, Senor Frogs, Mambo Caf\u00e9 (salsa dancing) and the Blue Parrot (can get crowded but it is on the beach, in sand and all) This was more of a couples place, but just me and girlfriend went and we still had a blast!", "Date": "May 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utah", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Vacation\u201d", "Author": "GoodeBoy", "ReviewID": "UR5147875", "Content": "Our fantastic vacation started with the warm greeting by Alex. He is the nicest person you will ever meet. We joked with him that he was there 24/7. The hotel like everyone else has indicated was wonderful. The food at the resteraunts was exceptional. The buffet on the other hand was not our favorite. They did not rotate the foods in the buffet and we got tired of breakfast there. The rooms were fantastic, just a word of warning, if you choose a room with double beds, The room is the same size as one with a king bed, the headboard is the same but the beds are side by side (touching) so that it kind of looks like a king bed. We were accidently given a room with double beds the first night and quickly changed it for the next. Tours - Find the Tulum express tour with Jorge. The company is based in Playa del Carmen and they are cheaper with smaller sized groups. If you go to Chizen itza with Cancun lines, you will ride a bus and spend two and a half hours morning and night just picking up and dropping people off. We left at 7am and returned at 7pm. Jorge claimes that he only takes 8 people in a van (one tour) and only charges $45. Not the $80 you will spend with Cancun lines. Jorge is a really great tour guide. If you want to go deep sea fishing and snorkling off the coast you have to go to Puerto Morales. Take the first road to the city on the south end. Take the road all the way to the park in front of the beach. You will see a small building on the left hand side of the road with a sea picture painted on the building. Go there for your snorkeling. $25 for two hours and well worth it. The fishing trip was average price, but the guides really work hard to give you a great time. STAY AWAY FROM THE TIME SHARE HOTEL ON THE SOUTH END OF PUERTO MORALES. It is an RCI affiliated location and the service was aweful. We got sucked into their presentation and then they could not make good on their free gift. The did nothing to try and resolve our situation. They waisted 2 hours of our day, and then did not compensate us for our time. In fact they told us that all they wanted was for us to see their hotel and help spread the word about them and their service. So here I am spreading the word, STAY AWAY!!!!!. Playa Del Carmen is a wonderful place to vacation, we have already gotten family members to look into going.

We also stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico (RPM) in May of 2000. We had a very nice, relaxing time. Food - really good for Mexico. We ate at the gourmet restaurant, the steakhouse, the Japanese restaurant, the Brazilian steakhouse, the daily lunch buffet and the breakfast buffet. We loved all the restaurants with the exception of the Brazilian - wouldn't recommend. I feel like we have reasonable expectations for the food in Mexico, but the Brazilian fell far short of what we're used to at Brazilian steakhouses here. If you like breakfast, they really do have a wonderful daily breakfast buffet. Rooms - nice. Similar to the RPM except these have a single king bed vs. two fulls pushed together and no bedet. The room was fine - but a bit noisy for naps - the entire floor in room and hallways is tile, and this creates quite a bit of loud echoing during the day. No problems with noise at night. Note that not many rooms have ocean views, and if a fantastic room view is important to you this may not be your hotel. Pool - AWESOME. I think this is one of the best resort pools I've seen. Loved the \"in-water\"tables around the pool bar and the \"in-water\" loungers. Liked the infinity pool and the daily water aerobics. NOTE: pool chairs go early - we got up one day at 7 AM to go and claim our chairs, and still did not get the ones we wanted. All the other days we got our choice. Beach - decent. Not much shade in beach area (the palm trees are still growing), and the surrounding hotels are having issues with erosion, and have these large, ugly exposed sandbags, which makes long beach walks less enjoyable. If beach is important to you, another hotel/ area may be better. We went to town one night for dinner - great little downtown shopping and dining district! Kids - we left ours at home, but we did see quite a few. The \"kids\" area is underwhelming in my opinion - a small wading pool and a small plastic swingset/climber. When we do decide to take our kid(s) to Mexico, we'll probably choose a more kid focused resort. For a couples' vacation this resort was perfect, but I wouldn't recommend for singles.

For those of you thinking of going...or already booked and keep checking for reviews (as I did everyday prior to departure) rest assured, you will LOVE it! I'm so sad to already be back. My friend and I were there for a week 4/26 - 5/3. (Yes, we were the two crazy girls from Michigan! haha) Let's start from the top: The hotel grounds: beautiful! I swear, you couldn't find a speck of dust if you tried. They keep the place in great condition. Granted, how run down can a 3 month hotel look? But, still, it is immaculate. The rooms: Spacious and lovely. Tip your cleaning person a few bucks here and there and you will never have a need for anything. I was impressed with how particular they are in making sure everything is to perfection. The pool: Large and inviting. I was a bit hesitant about the pool bar at first. Worried it might get kind of loud and overly obnoxious (and worried there would be spilled daiquirees all over the place)....but not at all. fun fun fun! Be sure to try the fruity blue colored drink. To die for. LOL. The beach: Beautiful. I was a bit worried (seeing the initial reviews about the beach). But they must have perfected it since, because I couldn't complain. The only thing that was a bit of a pain was walking back to the pool from the beach....a bit of an uphill walk (granted, not far) But, hey, if that's all I have to complain about...then no worries. Besides, we could all use the exercise after eating and drinking all day! Anyways, the water is turqoise and clean. Usually calm, but a bit wavy when the wind picks up in the afternoon. And that \"retaining wall\" = a total nonissue. The food: Very good. Not great...but no complaints. You MUST eat at Sir Olivers. My friend and I managed to get in twice and it was absolutely delicious. The Brazilian was okay, the Japanese not so good, the Mexican was good and we skipped the Steak House when we realized it was pretty much the same restaurant as Chilis (decent outdoor lunch restaurant). Oh, the buffets: Not bad at all. A lot of variety. The fruit was great (so were the darn hot dogs that I kept eating!) Entertainment: They have a really fun crew that kept the tourists well entertained throughout the night. Great outdoor music every evening and they had nice little outdoor events. IE - one night was a Mexican theme party...you walk through the plaza area and they serve you margaritas, tequila, etc all night long. You can stroll around, listening to the live beats of Mexican music, etc....all while being under the stars/ocean breaze, etc. It's rather intoxicating (and I'm not just talking about the liquorl!) hah Be sure to get out for a night or two. Karen's has great food down in Playa. Also, Mambo cafe is a lot of fun for dancing through the night. Anywhere on 5th Ave is fun. I was really happy to feel safe and secure in all the areas we went. They are really good about keeping others out of the hotel, unless they have a Riu wrist bracelet on. Few other helpful tips: Be sure to have a few drinks in the lobby bar. They make them delicious in there. If you want the high end liquor - just ask for it, they will provide. Tip your staff here and there and you'll be surprised how they remember everything. I'm talking to the details of the brand of tequila you like...to how many towels & bottles of water you need in the room, etc. OH - and be careful in the sun. I usually tan extremely well, but found the sun to be unbelievably potent. Bring a high number SPF - I promise, you will need it. Last but not least, we ended up taking a cab straight to the airport (vs. taking the shuttle) it was faster, and worth the $40. So, if you don't want to deal with a shuttle, the cab ride is great. That's about it for my review. Would I go back? Absolutely. Would I stay at the same place?For sure. It was the nicest RIU there, in my opinion. ps - for those of you travelling with kids, or if you're single - the majority at this resort were couples. However, my friend and I (both single and in our early 30's) managed to have a blast. We met a lot of great couples and partied with a lot of them. Not to mention, go into 5th Ave - and you will find all sorts.... Have fun!!

One of my guys is a picky eater so he preferred the buffet, which had something for everyone, every night. Breakfast was excellent! Rooms were good. Could have used a little more space for the 4 of us but we were unable to upgrade as bigger rooms were booked. One tip when booking your stay at the Riu, pay the extra and get the courtyard view. It would definitely by worth it. Our balcony faced generator of the hotel next door so not much of a view and alot of noise if your wanted to sit out on the balcony. (Couldn't hear it with the doors closed). Staff all over the hotel were incredible. Excellent entertainment/activity staff around the pool. They are very funny! Beach was great! Always a chair to be had. There no longer seems to be an issue about walking along the beach. You can walk to your hearts content. Sports bar is fun! Got to see some of the hockey playoffs!

Called for shampoo one day and it was at our door in 8 minutes. The food is good overall with enough variety to keep any normal human happy for a week. Plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables and meat. The specialty joints were OK, Mexican was excellent. Service was fantastic. We walked the beach to find exactly how hard some of the resorts had been hit by the hurricanes. It was bad.

There were several nice features but nothing that screamed this place is exceptional. We picked it due to proximity to cinco avenado and Playa's nightlife. This resort is for families and couples that want a slower paced vacation. This is a huge resort- 664 rooms and suites! Grounds and common areas were clean and very nice. Rooms- large and clean. Bed and pillows were brick hard. My wife loved that and I hated it. Overall, Nice. Food- Very mediocre but ample amounts of mediocre. The breakfast buffet was good with the secret to getting an egg or omelette in arriving by 8:15am. After that, wait in line for up to 15 minutes. Very large and good selection of fruit, juices, entrees. You should be happy. Lunch was good but not great. We only ate lunch on 2 of 7 days. Dinner- Buffet was ehhh. Agave was the best restuarant. The Shrimp entree was very good everything else was okay. Botofogo- I would not go again. All of the meet was overcooked and very chewy with the exception of the chicken- very good. Chili's- the strip was good. I like my meat MR and sometimes rare. My steak was cold in the center. I still ate it but I have an iron gut and enjoy a little blood in my meat. I think that would freak out everyone else- especially my wife, which is why I never told them that my strip was not cooked. We skipped the rest of the restuarants (Sir Oliver and Yahsima). We heard the Japanese was horrible- rice and sushi \"had the consistency of putty\". And we skipped our reservation for Sir Oliver's. We were just tired of the food and went into town for a superior dinner. By the way, Yaxche, La Parilla, Karen's, Casa Del Agua had far superior food to Riu. Go into Playa and treat yourself to a real experience at the locally owned and operated restuarants and then enjoy the superior nightlife of Cinco Avenado. We stayed away from the pool and easily found lounges at the beach. I just don't like to swim in a pool with a pool bar patronized by people that drink for 8 hours and never leave the pool- nasty, very nasty! Beach was nice, quiet, relaxing and in better shape than surrounding resorts. Overall, this resort is just a cattle processing plant shuffling in the tourists that experience the \"typical 5 nights\" and never leave the resort. It has no character and looks inferior to the original Palace down the street. Playacar is now more if a mini Cancun with the herds of people and congestion. This is why we don't go to Cancun and is why we will not return to Riu and never use a Riu property again. For the price, you get ten times the experience/value and Secrets Capri. I guess we just like smaller, higher quality, more personal service that cannot be matched at these mega resorts. By the way, this resort is not even close to a Ritz or Four Seasons in quality but it shares the distinction of being overpriced. This review is negative but you will have a good time.

My wife and I have been to Mexico seven times, mostly \"high end\" AI's, so I have a pretty good idea what goes on down at some of these resorts. I will try to list some of the objections/concerns that I seem to see on this website. Check In: Went fine and the staff was great. Staff: NEVER once did I ever encounter a rude person who worked for the hotel, in fact most of the staff go out of their way to accomodate you. The only rude people I encountered were other guests at the resort. Pool/Chairs: The pool is great. Everyone is correct about the chair situation around the pool and how the chairs are confiscated by people who go out early and secure their \"spot\". Honestly though, I have been to multiple \"5 Star\" resorts in Mexico, and this seems to be more the norm. RIU at least has a policy where if you just have a towel on the chair and you are n ot there for about 30 min, the towel is stripped away and the chair is fair game, unless of course you have a \"personal\" item on the chair. This does create some interesting dynamics between those who \"had\" the chair and then those who actually \"have\" the chair. Many open chairs on the beach and chairs are constantly opening up in the pool area so don't sweat it. Beach: If you want to take long walks on a huge beach then you may be disappointed. The beach is broken up by but once you get past the \"bad\" part, you can walk for a long time. Many people have complained about the beach and the dreaded \"retaining wall\". Come on....it is all but two feet high and if you stay to the left while looking at the ocean, you can walk right down. In fact the way the beach is set up is great, you can have the both of bith worlds. The beach does have some \"rocks\" (it is coral) and trust me, you can avoid this fairly easily. If you want to see what a crowded beach looks like, just go down to the other RIU's and you will see for yourself, chairs are everywhere and people are laying right up to the waters edge. Drinks: Fine, but make sure you call your liquor or you will get \"well\" liquor. Sent some drinks back that were a tad too strong, but that can be a good problem. The bartenders are great and really try to please you. People were complaining about getting drinks at the pool, or lack there of. Simple solution, get up off your chair and go the bar which is no more than 30 yards away, and then you will be ensured that there will be at least some slush left in your frozen drinks. I got tired of the same old line, \"I spent thousands and I can not even get noticed for a drink.\" Food: My wife and I do eat at many nice restaurants, especially with clients. The food is good. Really, no AI's food is great or \"5 Star\". The dinner buffet is consistently good if you have to go there, and trust me you will have to go there. Chili's, the lunch area, always has something decent to eat and stays open for most of the afternoon and is close to the pool. Went to Sir Oliver which was good but very small, the Mexican place, OK, and the Brazilian Steak House. That place was terrible(my opinion) and does not stack up to those \"real\" Brazilian places in most of your larger cities. Would have liked to try the Japanese place but good luck trying to get in. Reservations: Thank God for Elizabeth, she is great but I do not envy her job. She has to explain to every PO'd guest why they can not eat at the a la carte restaurant. Problem is that they have two seatings and the places are pretty small. This is very frustrating but this happens at most of the AI's that we have been to, just accept it. Not sure how these places get filled up so fast, but they do and you are dead in the water. Rooms: Beds are fine but hard. The TV stinks, but who is there to watch the TV? Full bar, never had to ask for H2O or anything. Leave a few bucks for Room Service and you will never have to ask for towels, aqua or anything. Location: Downtown Playa is a little over a mile away. Easy walk and if you do not want to walk back I heard cabs were $5 US. One other note.....the floors are slippery, and I mean slippery. The tile has a sheen or a polish on it that makes the floors feel like they are always wet. I am being serious, be careful, especially if you have had a few too many drinks and your walking down the hall back to your room. I saw a parent actually pulling their kid along the floor like they were on ice. One last note, special thank you to the folks that really made our stay a lot more fun: Damian, Mika, Rene, Enrique, Islas, Fito, Octavio. We would definitely go back as we were not disappointed.

The pool, nice fresh fluffy towels ever morning and plenty, I mean plenty of pool chairs everywhere. The beach, nice, plenty of chairs, but hardly any shade (palms are thinned out due to past hurricanes). Check in and check out was a breeze. Transportation to and from the airport was fine and well organized. Go to Playa (town) at night, it's fun and energetic. Go to Tulum and Cob\u00e0, not to be missed!

I am puzzled by the reviews that give Dining 5 stars--have these people ever eaten at a 4-star restaurant? If all it takes to make you happy are tons of food in an all-you-can-eat-buffet, then I guess you'll be fine; however, I'd rather have fewer choices, done well. The a la carte restaurants are VERY MEDIOCRE. I admit I'm a bit of a food snob (and a good cook), but if I'm eating at the hotel's pretentious French restaurant (Sir Oliver's), then I expect the food to be at least as good as at my local IHOP. It was not. (Note to tourists: A great chef once said, \"People who order a filet mignon well-done get what they deserve.\") Beach, Rooms, Service, Hotel Decor: Great, great, great. All the raves about these in other reviews are deserved. Note to other \"cosmopolitan\" travelers without kids: I'm 33 and my partner is 34. We are college-educated (one a PhD), liberal Democrats from the Northeast. If that makes us elitist or snobs, then you can ignore this post. To be honest, the worst thing about this resort were the other guests. I got sick of being around so many fat, spoiled, rude Americans (and their spoiled kids) who bark at the Mexican staff members (who are themselves working 12-hour days for the equivalent of $5 a day). The hotel clearly asks guests to \"dress\" for dinner at the restaurants (i.e. no shorts, dinner jacket for men), yet many people came in dirty shorts, sandals, hawaiian shirts, etc.--attacking the food like it was their last meal on earth. At times, it was like eating in the food court at Disney World. If you're looking for a \"classy\" vacation spot, then look elsewhere (or go to Europe).", "Date": "April 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding!!!\u201d", "Author": "SpidyOR", "ReviewID": "UR4991456", "Content": "Hello All, We just returned yesterday from an AMAZING week long stay at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. A little background on us, I am 32 and my girlfriend is 23. I am the President/C.E.O. of a major NYC company and my girlfriend is a designer for a major shoe manufacturer. Our time is precious so when we travel we have enormous expectations. My girlfriend had previously traveled to the Riu Paradise Island and was raved about the experience, so we decided to give the Riu Palace Riviera Maya a shot... and to say the least they hit a grand slam. The rooms were wonderful. King size bed, Jacuzzi Tub, beautiful balcony, full refrigerator of beverages (Corona, Pepsi, H2O, Bacardi, Jose Cuervo, Vodka and Brandy). More than enough to drink!!! The grounds were immaculate. Absolutely impeccable! The fountains were gorgeous, the pool was wonderful and the beach was magnificent! I have heard people complain about the beach, I find those complaints unfounded. We walked down the beach from our hotel past 5 or 6 other resorts... The Food was tremendous... Eat until your heart is content. Breakfast was amazing, omelet station was a staple, freshly made pancakes, my girlfriend loved the yogurt station and the fresh juices, but that stuff is just too healthy for me : ) Lunch was a standard buffet of hamburgers, hotdogs, pizza and salad... noting to write home about, however sufficient. Dinner had a plethora of choices. You have 6 options, (standard buffet, Mexican Restaurant, Steak House, Japanese Restaurant, Brazilian BBQ and the Sir Olivers (Fine Dining experience). We ate in the following in all with the exception of the Japanese Restaurant. I would say they were equally tremendous. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food, especially a fantastic Rib Eye at the Steak House (and this coming from a regular at Sparks, Del Frisco's and Lugars). We decided to go on one excursion and I have to say it was incredible. I have traveled to Cancun twice in the past and did the excursion to Chichen Itza and Xcaret, both were excellent... however I wanted to try something new. We decided to go on a special tour to Coba (Mayan Ruins), the tour incorporated a zip line tour through the jungle also known as canopy tours, repelling 35 feet into a sinkhole landing in a beautiful fresh water well, kayaking through a river, eating lunch in a Mayan Village and climbing the highest pyramid in the Yucatan. This trip was money so well spent, I strongly suggest you try this if you are up for fun and adventure!!! Good for men, women and even children. The Spa services were excellent. We did a 50 min and an 80 min couples massage on the beach and was both left with major smiles on our faces and no tension in our bodies. I could use one right now!!! Here are a few tips that I picked up along the way. 1. The trip from the airport takes about 45 minutes. The cost of a taxi is approx. $62 dollars US. There is a line for the taxi stand, however if you tip the guy on line $5 dollars, you can skip the line! 2. If you want to sit at the pool, you will have to get there early!!! There are plenty of seats at the beach, however I am convinced people wake up at 6am, go to the pool, put there towel on a chair and go back to bed... if you get to the pool at 9am, you are fresh out of luck for a chair... and you are dreaming if you think you are going to get 2 or more together! : ) This maybe the only negative thing I have to say about the entire experience. 3. Bring lots of single dollar bills... tipping the bartender, maid and wait staff always goes a long way. Plus these people are working very hard and it is nice to share your gratitude with others. Trust me, you will receive extra special attention. 4. Request a room with a fountain view... it was breath taking!!! We were on the third floor (top floor) and that was just perfect. I think the 1st floor is fine, however if you can get the second or third floor, the view is well worth the extra cost. 5. Diner reservations are between 12-4pm. You can book for 2 nights at a time. I would suggest you book Sir Oliver (fine dining) ASAP, this is the smallest of the dining rooms and also a meal you don't want to miss on vacation. 6. Make sure you go to the town of Playa Del Carmen. 5th Street in Playa has excellent shopping, from traditional American standards (Diesel, Lactose, Harley Davidson, etc.), and traditional shops with great silver and other local treats. 7. The night life in Playa is great! Go to the Blue Parrot! The bar is on the beach and the music and drinks flow until the wee hours of the morning! Also the Tequila Barrel was a cool drinking spot. Try the Kaluha Daiquiri!!! 8. Request the King Size Bed! 9. If you are lucky enough to get a seat by the pool... the next step is securing a beach umbrella. If you do get an umbrella, I suggest tying it up to your beach chair... people are courteous enough not to take your towel off your seat, however they will take your umbrella if you leave it for an extended period of time. 10. Join a gym near your house before you book.. because you are going to need one when you get home. I think I put on 3-lbs.! LOL I know this message is long winded and I went into great detail here, however the opinions on this site helped me tremendously and I am in debt to the wonderful posters before me, who gave me tremendous insight to the hotel and helped assist me in choosing this spectacular vacation. We came to our decision to go to the Riu by using tripadvisor, deciding this was the vacation we wanted... and I have to say it exceeded our lofty expectations. I just got off the phone with my girlfriend moments ago and we can't wait to book to go again. I give this experience 5 stars and would easily put this up there with stays at the Four Season and Ritz Carlton's of the world for 1/3 the cost. I was completely impressed and overly satisfied.

A little background on our group- 12 people, ranging in age from 13-50's\u2026extended family of both couples, singles, and a teenager, many of us live in NYC, the rest in NJ. This was our first trip to a RIU, stayed for 10 days-and we ALL had a fantastic time! We are a well travelled group, but haven't visited many all inclusive resorts (though of the ones we have this was the best!) Grounds- The hotel grounds are truly like a palace and they are beautiful & immaculate in every way! The staff all work so hard to ensure everything is perfect, every time we turned around we saw someone cleaning or scrubbing something, always with a smile and an \"Hola!\" as we passed. From the moment we stepped into the gorgeous lobby & were greeted with a welcome drink they treated us like special guests and accommodated every request we had, including adjoining rooms etc. Rooms- The rooms were big and spacious, everyone with a balcony, fully stocked mini fridge & liquor dispenser (with Bacardi, Cuervo, Vodka & Brandy), and a spa tub. Some of our group had standard views (overlooking outside the hotel onto other resorts) and some had fountain views which were very nice views, but not worth the $$ if you ask me. The rooms are identical except for the view from the balcony, and there is so much going on at any time of the day/night, that we were never in our rooms except to sleep! I recommend higher rooms than the ground floor (only bc the views are better). The maids left new towel animals everyday- and came around again each night to ensure you had fresh towels and a stocked fridge. The \"Animacion Staff\" (Entertainment team) was awesome! They ran all kinds of activities every day and night perfect for all ages, from Merengue lessons at the pool, to water aerobics, water & beach volleyball, Bingo, horseshoes, rifle shooting tournaments, soccer on the beach, beach parties with dancing & sangria during the day, face painting & musical chairs for kids, Spanish lessons, different shows every night, evening dancing with the guests in the plaza, coordinating group bar trips to the town bars at night, and so much more. They try their best to have activities for everyone and to have everyone join in\u2026 they really are an amazing group of people, they were so full of energy and so nice, I don't know how they do it but sure glad that they do! Hola Octavio, Mildred, Miguel, Josie, & Adriana!! Each late night after they got off work you could also find them in town at any of the local bars- we made some great friends in them! They are also huge sources of information for excursions, shopping, and life outside the resorts. Pool- HUGE! Love the built in tables near the bar, and the built in lounge chairs! So pretty and just steps from the beach\u2026 YES the towel game is definitely played here, but it's been played at every resort I've ever been to so this is no exception- just be ready to play. Even if you got down to the pool late & no loungers were available, the staff was happy to pull extra loungers up from the beach area for you. It was really only an issue when the resort was at capacity (only part of the time we were there). They make strong great drinks at \"Daiquiris\" (the swim up pool bar) and they are fun bartenders, happy to make you anything you ask for- and they are not at all stingy with using top shelf liquors or making your drinks strong- and they keep the rounds coming as long as your ready! The also have waitress service at the loungers and in pool tables which was a nice touch! Beach- it's great, beautiful, lots of lounge chairs, palm trees, hammocks, it was wonderful. I don't know WHY people on this board could have one complaint about the area- the retaining wall is no big deal, it just ensures that the RPRM has a private beach area, and the white fence was pretty and a nice touch\u2026. We all liked it and we grew up on the beaches in NJ and have travelled to many all over the country/world so we are no beach novices. The water is a gorgeous clear blue, so clean, and warm! They had catamarans, kayaks, parasailing, banana boats, jet skis, snorkelling, scuba trips, paddle boats, etc. all that you could use on the beach. The motorized sports were an additional fee but everything else was included, and they allow you a lot of freedom with the water toys- we kayaked down passed all of the resorts in the area to open beach (quite a ways from our hotel) and no one tried to have us stay closer. Food- Great! As I said some of us live in NYC and dine at all types of restaurants and enjoy going out for a good meal- everyone had an easy time finding things they liked. The breakfast buffet was grand and included anything you wanted (stops serving at 1030am). Lunch at Chili's was also good- mix of hot and cold buffet foods, lots of variety every day. Everything from Pizza to Sandwiches, Burgers, fries, Salads, fruits, fajitas, even calamari were available- and the BEST ice cream ever. Seriously I don't know what they put in it but it was amazing. Dinner- specialty restaurants were great!!! Even picky eaters in my family enjoyed the food, particularly the Japanese and Sir Olivers Gourmet, though they were all good! They took reservations in the lobby from 12-4 for the restaurants (best to book at least a day ahead of time to ensure you get what you want!) but they were able to accommodate our party of 12 so we could try each restaurant on the property. No one got sick from eating anything, though they recommend using bottled water to brush your teeth, everything else is purified (ice in drinks, salads, etc all perfectly fine!) Nightlife- we are late diners, and enjoy staying up late for drinks/dancing. Each night we had dinner around 9 and then headed out to \"La Plaza\" to catch the end of the show and enjoy the live music playing from the gazebo. They also brought vendors in on 3 nights that were were there to sell jewelry and souveniers in the plaza at night- nice touch but compared to town they were expensive. They have waiter service at all the tables (with the sweetest servers!) and the Animacion staff came out each night to dance & chat with the guests. Last call is midnight when the music stops, but they never pushed you out if you wanted to enjoy sitting in the plaza while you finished your drinks or just relaxed (they'd also give you a bottle of wine if you wanted to stay & enjoy or take it up to your room). Lots of nights we were still ready to party so we headed into town (a $5 USD cab fare) or a walk of about 10-15 minutes and went to places like Blue Parrot, Mambo Caf\u00e9, Santanera, Bali, etc. All of 5th avenue is full of lounges, bars, etc. that have nightlife going till 4am and are a lot of fun!! A great mix of tourists and locals alike and not expensive (example Blue Parrot charges a $10USD cover but that includes 2 beers!) and drinks inside were all reasonable. There was also the club at the Riu Tequila property that we ventured over to, they played great music and we had fun, but it was mainly a young crowd (teenagers) on the dance floor so if you are looking for a lot of nightlife after midnight- take the short trip into town to 5th avenue- where there was NO shortage of partying, dancing, and hanging out and you won't be sorry! Overall a great family friendly resort- our young teenager had no problem making tons of friends, and we always felt that they were supervised well by the staff running the activities. It's definitely not a \"singles\" scene, but the bars in town definitely were if that\u2019s what you were looking for. There were families and couples there from all over the world, and only speaking \"un poco espanol\" we had no problems communicating anything, all activities, menus, staff etc. were in a number of languages. It was an amazing vacation and I can't wait to go back as soon as possible.

THIS IS NOT AMERICA. It is Mexico. The food is different. You can\u2019t compare Outback and Morton\u2019s to this resort. I have stayed at many hotels and many Riu\u2019s around the world and this one gets first place in my book. Hotel- The design and architecture is for the most part the same as the Riu Palace Mexico. Just updated! It is definitely the nicest hotel in the Playacar area. There was a wow factor from the minute we drove up to it for the first time. We went Parasailing and got to see all of the hotels from a birds-eye view. The hotel stands out among them all. Food- Chilis- Soup and salad were great; service was attentive and most excellent. You are allowed to order as much as you want; you just have to do it before hand, not after you have finished eating and want more. If you feel like you need more, hit the buffet. Buffet- Food was great. One needs to remember what region of the country you are in. The buffet offers many choices each night. They have theme nights. We stayed for a week, and there was something different offered each night. They offered plenty of vegetable dishes, meat dishes and pasta choices every night on the buffet. Everything was very fresh and healthy. We had incredible service at the buffet. They wait on you and ask several times if you need anything else. Nightlife- We visited all of the bars. They have regular bartenders that are eager to make you a special of the night of their choice. Daniel was our favorite bartender. He was in the lobby bar. Beach & Ocean- BEAUTIFUL!!!! There is nothing, I repeat nothing wrong with the beach here. It was a very large area with palm trees and lots of chairs not being utilized. The retaining wall is not a big deal. You have to go down about 7 steps on one end to get to the beach, and on the other end, you just have to walk up a small incline to get back to the chairs. The retaining wall is a big plus in my view; it will save the resort in the event of a rise in the ocean, or a big storm. They must know what they are doing when they engineer these things. If you are into water sports, you will love the beach here. They offer sailing, windsurfing, kayaks, paddleboats, and boogie boards. All of these are Free and a lot of fun. All you have to do is sign a piece of paper saying you will take care of the equipment. Pool- Amazing!!! Very Spacious and offers a swim up bar for your drinking needs. The area in front of the bar has 2 jetted tubs and about 6 lounge style tables and seats to enjoy. Chairs were not a problem during our stay, there was plenty available everywhere. Be sure to wear lots of Sunscreen. The sun is very powerful and you will get burnt FAST! We used 15 and 30 and still managed to get slightly burnt. A thermal mug was a plus if you want to enjoy your day without having to go to the bar all the time to get a drink. The pool waiters/waitresses were very friendly and loved filling up my large Bubba Mug. They also had great memories for what you have been drinking during your visit. I was sure to tip them well. Bring some Washington\u2019s. Rooms- We initially were given a room near the theatre, but asked to move the next day because it was very loud in the room at night. We had traveled all day and wanted to get some sleep the first night, but had a hard time sleeping with the music pumping through the closed door and echoing into the room. We explained our situation to Roberto, a manager at the front desk, and he found us a new room the next day that was closer to the pool and it was very nice. The mattresses are very firm, but they will bring a mattress pad and as many pillows as you would like. They stocked the fridge in the room daily, which was really nice, because we drank a lot of the small waters. Playa Del Carmen - Much more relaxed atmosphere than Cancun. Shopping was easier and friendlier. A lot less pushy than Cancun. Shops are willing to bargain with you. A cab to 5th Ave was a flat fee of $5.00 USD. Each way. Bars and nightlife ends around 12:00 AM. Tequila Barrel was a great bar for adults over 30. They have a live band and a dance floor. I also want to mention that they have 2 computers with free internet available. Most of the other bars we saw were mainly for teens and young 20\u2019s. Ferry to Cozumel-- Cost was about $22.00 USD Round trip per person. Shopping was about the same as PDC. They did seem to have higher prices there, as they cater to the wealthy cruise ships in the area. Transfer to/from Cancun Airport- We hired a private car for $95.00 USD round trip. The driver was waiting for us at the Airport with our last name on a sign. We searched for the best deal and found that ----/cancun was the best deal. Alfredo was our driver and he got us to the Riu in about 40 minutes. He was right on time to pick us up as well. They take paypal as payment, so rest assure your getting a good deal for the private car.", "Date": "April 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cJust Returned - EXCEPTIONAL\u201d", "Author": "raysun", "ReviewID": "UR4954740", "Content": "Just returned Spring Break Apr 6 from the Riu Palace Riviera Maya. For those of you who have been reading previous reviews to try to get a perspective of this resort and want to know what to expect, pay NO attention to the negativity. My husband and I have been to Mexico (Riviera Maya) several times with and w/o our children (ages 4 & 9). This has been the best vacation thus far. We plan to return early summer with the kids. Let me give you some honest feedback regarding this resort. You must know, I am 34 years old, my husband 36 - I am probably the most meticulous person one could meet. I do extensive research and can honestly say, after reading several of the reviews, we almost cancelled our trip all together. GLAD we didn't! We tried several times to add our photo's to this site however, were unsuccessful. To give you some comparison - we've stayed at resorts such as the Iberostar Lindo, Del-Mar and the Barcelo -These resorts do not even compare! WEATHER: Called for partly cloudy to cloudy skies each day- HA! Not a cloud in the sky and upper 80s ALL week! HOTEL: Immaculate! For those who said the resort was \"stuffy\" - hmmmm, not quite sure where that came from. The staff (particularly - bar tender Daniel from the lobby) will go out of their way to please. When we arrived - yes tired, we 'chose' our attitude and it was to be pleasant! Guess what? we received a free up-grade to a fountain view room w/o even asking. They appreciate kindness from us- not arrogance! They work way to hard (for pennies) to have to listen to snippy people. I know, we experienced it while checking in. The women next to me marched right in and was very demanding - I can't imagine she received a free up-grade like we did. How embarrassing (for her). ROOMS: Absolutely no complaints. We didn't feel the need to have maid service everyday - if we needed to exchange our towels we just did it before going down to the pool/beach for the day as the maid staff was already working. I did however, bring my own foam matress pad (which fit nicely in our suitcase) and was glad I did. Oh, ahem... I also brought my own sheets - did I mention that I was meticulous? :) Alchohol dispensers right in the room with premium brands. My husband liked that. POOL: exceptional, perfect temp, never crowded (even during prime time). Chairs? Yes, you may have to get up a little early however, we were down to the pool everyday by 9:00 am and never had trouble getting chairs. Sure, if you want 'prime pool front chairs' then ok, get up at 6 or 7 and head down before breakfast. Not really a huge deal at all. Pool bar was fantastic. Again, staff was eager to please. They had entertainment such as poolside dancing lessons and bingo (late in the day with prizes - HA you may have to dance \"sexy\" to get a t-shirt - all good fun). Great drinks, you just ask for what you want and they will oblige. BEACH: HUGE! For those who complained of rocks... I have to laugh, those are not rocks - that is called CORAL! The Yuchatan has the second longest coral reef in the world. So don't be surprised to find coral... divers LOVE IT!! Plenty of beach and its getting better every week. We tried each day to figure out where other reviewers have said there is \"No Beach\". Actually, from the pool area to the shoreline there is a stretch of about 50 yards by 80 yards of nothing but pure white crushed coral and shells- perfect for walking on as it is cool to the touch from the limestone content. The only thing which seperates the Riu from other resorts is a wall which will save the resort's beachfront from further wind erosion- smart move on their part. By far the best all along the strip! Plenty beach chairs too - no need to towel save them! FOOD: I am not a huge fan of the food regardless of the resort however, I did have more of a variety to choose from at this resort compared to the others. They are getting better and better in Mexico to try to compare to our taste. Hamburgers, chicken, pizza, salad, fruit, etc... all good. Chili's restaurant (lunch and dinner) by far the best! I did bring my own syrup for breakfast and used it everday - but they had excellent omelets, hashbrown wedges (YUM!), lots of fruit, and other wonderful items. The buffet was good, always something different. Again, if you like seafood and all that stuff that I couldn't recognize, you will be just fine! Even if you are not a fan of the food, you will be find something to suit your fancy. I brought quite a bit of my own snacks and never even ate them! Entertainment: We tripped up the road a mile or two to Playa Del Carmen/5th Avenue - Plenty to do there. They did have organized shows everynight. Not a huge \"party/get drunk\" kind of scene - which was fine with us. If you wanted to do that - you could walk two minutes across the street to one of the other Riu's and go to the disco. Too young for us. We did check it out though. We recommend the Tequila Barrel in PDC. More our age. Plenty dancing. KIDS: Perfect for all ages. Small children, they have a kids club - I tried to pay attention as we'll probably bring our kids back and they seem to be very active with the kids. Always doing some sort of structered activity. Even if you choose not to entertain that kind of thing, the pool is an excellent source of entertainment for the kids. Not to mention the beach. Kids seemed to have loved the infinity pool - jumping over the side into the larger pool -my kids would have loved it! Self serve kiddie cocktails and chips and cheese were a hit with the little ones near the pool! TEENAGERS: Goodness, plenty of those at the other Riu's and they can visit those resorts for free (and even w/i walking distance either by beach or street front)! They will love the disco at the Riu Tequila (I think that is the one) right down the road. Great for teens and because the strip is all secured it is perfectly safe for them to walk! This resort is PERFECT for everyone! It sits along a PDC strip all secured within it's own little area with security guards at the \"main enterance\" you can walk up and down and to all the different resorts and feel secure!

My wife and I have vacationed in Cancun and Playa Del Carmen several times and this is by far the most attractive resort in either of these two towns. It is striking! For those of you who have been following this resort's reviews you already know about the debate about the beach. Breath easier. The beach itself is about 200 yards wide. Yes, there is a section which is rocky. that section makes up approximately 50 yards. Walk around it. The actual beach for swimming was quite nice. Yes, there is a retaining wall for about 100 yards but much of the beach goes right to the water. Never an issue. A note on the beach. I love to walk the beach for miles, as many of you do. There has been a good deal of erosion of the beaches and there are places where it is difficult to walk around a home or retaining wall to continue your walk. If you choose to go right or south there is one place in particular which is a bit trecherous (but not impossible). If you want to go left, toward town, it is almost impossible without going into the playacar residental community. I did this one time and no one gave me any trouble. The resort is breathtaking. Our room was unbeleaveably beautiful, and the common areas are stunning. The service was good and the employees always found a way to say hola before you had a chance to. There have been complaints about sound levels. This is an area where there could be some improvement. The halls are tiled with marble and yes at 7:30 every morning you can start to hear the maids carts echo down the hall. I started to wear ear plugs because I sleep so lightly. It never bothered my wife. The food was good, I would not say great. My experience was that the lunch buffet and breakfasts were quite good. The dinner buffet was so so and we found ourselves going into Playa to eat several nights. No big deal. My only real complaint. Yes, it is the \"making reservations\" at the premium restaraunts. This can only take place between 12:00 and 4:00 PM. So you have to walk back to the resort and get in line for 20 minutes to talk to a rather snooty woman to get your times for the specialty restaurants. I am a doctor and this somehow got caught in my craw. I don't have a problem with signing up for the specialty restaurants, that is how it is done in the all inclusives. It is more the timing and the attitude of the person taking the reservations. Perhaps some tweeking is in order. The specialty restaraunts were only slightly better than the buffet. The exception to this was the French restaraunt \"Sir Oliver's\". The service and food were quite good. The Mexican and Steakhouse were average at best. Per other reviews, my wife and I tried out the dance club at the Riu Tequila. This club does not open until 11:00. As my wife and I were waiting for the club to open and watching a rather good magician, my wife screamed and pointed to the ground. There was a 4 inch scorpion heading for a table of ladies ten feet from us. I ran to them and informed them that we had a visitor and then stomped on it several times until it was dead. Yes, my wife was pretty freaked. People came around and took pictures of it. Makes you wonder about first floor rooms, does it not? The Riu Tequila is a 4 on a scale of 1-10, with the Place being a 9.5. The club by the way was pretty lame and was mostly 15 and 16 year olds (yes, they were drinking). Just as an aside. My wife and I went to Cozumel for a day of shopping and snorkeling. What a disappointment. The reef is gone folks! The fish are there and the water is just as clear, but the fish have no place to hide due to the coral being destroyed in the hurricane.", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cnice time\u201d", "Author": "Simonandfamily", "ReviewID": "UR4948522", "Content": "My wife (47), our son (13) and friend (12) and I (49) stayed Mar 31 - April 6.

Third, don't worry about the food - its fine and plentiful. The non-buffet restaurants are ok, but you get the same thing at the buffets. Anybody who complains about the food is just too picky, or nuts. There is so much to choose from, and its all decent. Breakfast is the best. Fourth, the help loves tips, so bring ones. Fifth, if you are a serious beach person, this is not the best hotel. Beach is ok, but can't really walk very far, and the water is a bit rough. Might consider Palace Mexico instead if you must have a long beach. But the RM pool is better than Mexico. Sixth, don't stay on the property the whole time. Go to Playa Del Carmen for dinner and shopping. Go to Xcaret. Both are fun. Seventh, don't be an ugly American. I can't tell you how many times I heard people say insensitive things to the locals working at the resort. Some may have been drunk, but no excuse. Be respectful. Eighth, the AIRPORT SUCKS.

Not edible if you are use to eating usda choice meats. The beach is beautiful spent most our time here, the water is incredible the sand is white and soft. the children loved the water sports kayaking was tough some days due to the waves, but loved boogie boarding. They also went parasailing which we went next door for because the resorts people would not allow an adult to go on the boat to watch. the pools are beautiful with a great swim up bar. the problem is people keep there towels over night and wake up early to hog the pool chairs. you have to get up early to sit by the pool. the pool person gets ther by 7 A.M. and the chairs have been taken by then. they should remove all towels if they are there prior to 7 A.M. there is a lot to do with your children during the day and in the evening they put on a great show. we did not use the kids club at all so i can not let you know about that, but who goes on a family vacation and dumps the kids anyways. the town is also worth going to, its adorable and there is a great restaurant on 5th and 6th street called CHICAGO great usda steaks. also to the left of the resort 4 min. walk there is a cute little shopping center. all in all this was a great vacation would def. reccomend this resort. it was are first all inclusive and i would def. go back to riu palace riviera maya", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tecumseh, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cLoved this place!\u201d", "Author": "TravelMexico4", "ReviewID": "UR4829708", "Content": "I can honestly say that I cannot understand at all where some of these reviews are coming from.

It was smooth sailing from the moment they checked us in. We arrived at the hotel and were taken to the lovely lobby bar and given a welcome drink. We signed in while being seated. We sat by the window, which overlooked the courtyard and the pool. What an amazing view! I was travelling with my husband and 11 year old daughter. A group of 14 other people were also on our flight. They were all doctors and their families. They thought the hotel was spectacular too! The room: Once we got to our room after 3pm, we were pleasantly surprised. We had a lovely king size bed, small sitting area with a sofa and tv and a hydro massage tub in the bathroom. The balcony faced the Viva Wyndham Azteca next door and was nice and quiet. The maid: We left a tip from day one and the maid service was great! She turned down our bed one night with chocolates on the pillow. Other times she made swans or people out of the towels. A nice touch. The pool: There were 2 pools. One raised pool and the main pool. There were built in loungers on both sides of the main pool. There was a swim up bar in the main pool also.There was a waitress around the pool daily to take your drink order. We are pool people, so this is where we hung out everyday. The beach: There was some damage to the beach after the hurricane, but it is coming back. The beach just beyond the pool is beautiful white sand and private. There are always a lot of chairs to sit on at the beach, so if you get up after 6:30am and don't get a chair at the pool, you won't have a problem at the beach. The beach directly in front by the water is a bit rocky and not great, but when the wind is calm you can walk all the way down the beach to the other Riu hotels. The hotel: The design and architecture is amazing! It is definitely the nicest hotel in the Playacar area. There is a wow factor from the minute you walk into the front lobby. Even nicer than the Riu Palace Mexico. The food: The buffet for breakfast daily had anything that you could possibly want for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes and I especially liked the variety they had of yogurt and fresh fruit. If you are into champagne and orange juice, it was served daily.The coffee was also very good! For lunch, we ate at Chili's by the pool. It had typical lunch food such as burgers, fries, pizza, salads and more. For dinner, we usually went to the buffet restaurant as there was a different theme every night. We did enjoy the Mexican A la carte. The shrimp and chicken were great! We ate at the Japanese restaurant as well and my daughter really enjoyed the chicken terriyake. The drinks: The pina coladas and margaritas were great! So was a cold corona after a nice walk to the Playacar shopping mall, which was only a 7 minute walk. The entertainment: They had a mini disco kids show at 8pm each night. Then, the main show was at 10pm. After that, there was the house band which was from Cuba. They played salsa, merengue and more. They were really good. Location: This hotel was in the best location in the Playacar area. You were 5 minutes by cab, which cost only 5.00USD each way. You could walk there in 15minutes. We walked during the day and also at night to Playa del Carmen. A lovely little town with lots of shopping.Don't forget to bargain with the vendors! Overall: We had a wonderful time! I would go back again tomorrow.

Not counting the Four Seasons at Nevis (which is at a different class), the service here was fantastic. Although I speak Spanish, my wife does not and she did not have any problems communicating with the staff who were friendly and helpful. Bartenders and waiters were attentive and friendly. More importantly, when there were minor problems or requests, the staff was quick to respond. For example, one day the air conditioning was not working well. There was someone to fix the AC within 5 minutes. And then rectified the problem within another 5 minutes. The hotel and the grounds were extremely clean and impeccable. As far as the food, I thought the breakfast buffet and the lunch buffet at Chili's were good and better than I thought it would be. For dinner, I ate at the steakhouse (Fair), Japanese (Fair) and the Mexican (good). The wine was not good but the I loved the Corona on tap that kept flowing. We are in our late thirties and at night there is not much to do. But, the great thing is that you are only minutes away from 5th Ave in Playa. Some good bars and restaraunts there. Make sure you check out a couple especially La Casa de Agua. There are also places to go dancing and stay out until the early morning hours. Daniel, Tito and Fito at the bar in the hotel can fill you in on the hot spots. Minor complaints is that the sand on the beach had too much cement rocks in it. Also, you do need to swim on the right side of the beach because the left side of the beach has too many rocks on it. I also did not like making reservations and standing in line for 10 minutes. The only major complaint was that the gym was woefully inadequate. It had one each of a treadmill, stepper, eliptical and bike. Also it only had four other machines.

My wife and I traveled with my teenage son. The Hotel was great in almost all categories, the room was spacious, well appointed and very clean, housekeeping did a great job during our stay. The minibar staff forgot our room one day of the trip, but it wasn't a big deal. Service everywhere was excellent except the front desk didn't answer the phone when called, best bet is to go see them. Getting a lounger at the pool was a task, you need to go early and put out your towels to get one anywhere close, I saw people headed to the pool with towels as early as 6:00 in the morning. The service at the spa was excellent, my wife and I both had a massage while there and they were some of the best we have had at resorts. The food was okay, not excellent but we could always find something we liked. We ate at the Brazilian and Mexican restaurants and while the food was good at both you still felt like you were in a buffet and presentation was uninspired. They will not take reservations for the table service restaurants on the same day, even though there were always empty tables so make your reservations the day you get there. The beach is better than earlier photos and appears to have repaired itself somewhat from the hurricane. The bottom in the swimming area was clean sand. We got a ground floor room which we normally hate but we had a very nice view of the pool, ocean and courtyard. Overall we would go back again as it was a very nice experience.

Only, I assume nicer, since it's brand new. Reasons it's excellent: Great Service, Great food and drinks, nice rooms with stocked minibar. View of ocean is spectacular in Playacar. The pools are nicer than what I remember of the RIU Palace Mexico. They have an infinity pool that empties into larger pools and swim up bar area. Really nice! We ate at the buffet all week with the exception of one night, we ate at the Japanese place. The Japanese Restaurant was excellent. I wanted to go to other Ala Carte's, but we didn't because it was hard to schedule, and we were a bit burned and didn't want to dress up too much with our daughter with us, etc. I heard the others were great from people that went. Some dissapointments: I do agree about the eggs and some other food at the buffets that should probably been cooked a bit better, but it's not as bad as the previous post makes it out. I think there is something for everybody at the buffet and the Ala Carte place is great. The beach is nice, but there's no umbrellas and the trees aren't big enough to provide shade. Also, the beach doesn't roll into the ocean as it did at other Playacar hotels - it is held up by a retaining wall since there is some reef on a portion of the beach near the hotel. There is some swimmable beach area, but it's pretty small and not as inviting as the resorts down the road. I see this is the most common complaint with people. The process for scheduling meals in the restaurants was a bit frustrating. You have to meet with a lady in the lobby at least one day prior to going, and she is only there from 12-4. She provides you a booking. I was told the hotel was half occupied, and some of the restaurants were booked full 2 days in advance. There were limited chairs around the pool, and people were a bit rude by claiming their chair for the whole stay by leaving their stuff out on the chair or coming out at 5am to claim chairs for their family. By 10am, it was virtually impossible to find a set of chairs around the pool area. Again, they were 50% occupied according to the front desk, so I could envision fights breaking out at the pool area at 100% occupation! :) I heard lots of people talking about this around us in the morning. The sports bar is cloudy with smoke. You would normally expect it at a bar, but since this is the place to go for Internet access and out-of-schedule eating (snack bar, sandwiches, etc), they really need to put in some serious ventilation or expand it. The rooms were all Smoking (or at least our area was), and the Smoke carried through the hallways and into the room through the AC venting. The RIU Palace is not kid oriented. There are kids there of all ages, but they get extremely bored during the day. We knew this going into it, but was our first major vacation with our daughter, we didn't know how she'd react. The kids club was open from 10-12, and from 3-5. We felt comfortable with our 4 year old hanging out with the guy working the club, since he was a nice enough guy and knew where we were sitting,.. but, because of the varying ages, I think he had trouble catering to 4-6 year olds, when the 7-12 year olds would want to do something more interesting. I know some places have 2 kids clubs, to keep the little ones more interested in playing at the pool, coloring, etc. Where the older kids want to play soccer on the beach or do something more for their age group. Overall, it was a great Resort, and deserves it's excellent ratings, as long as people aren't expecting entertainment for their kids.

Our room was above the theatre, not the place to be if you want any quiet evenings. THe noise in our room was excessive from the shows. Ask for a room away from the theatre. Food- Very good buffet. Service was very good most of the time. Large variety of food to chose from. The buffet food was very tasty and well prepared. Ala carte restaurants- Sir Oliver was outstanding. Highly recommend it. Mexican ala carte and Steakhouse- Limited menu selections is the big downfall. I prefered the buffet over either of these. Pool- big improvement over the Riu Palace Mexico's pool (for comparison) Larger, more child friendly, large infinity pool, sun loungers and tables and chairs built into the water. Beach- NO SHADE. No palapas, palm trees are too immature to provide any shade at all. If you are a \"beach person\" this is not a good set up. We spent the day at the RPM to use their beach, which is far superior. ($5.00 taxi ride, or 15 minute walk) Front desk-They know what customer service means. Thank you to Hugo for tracking down my husband's lost luggage. He left his carry on in the airport shuttle van, which contained his medicine. Hugo contacted the van driver and had our bag delivered to our room within hours.

Every day for 5 days we had to have a new set of keys. The key problem should have been corrected, it never was. Ice- hard to come by. The breakfast buffet did not have an ice dispenser.

So let me tell you about who we are. I was traveling with my wife, we're 32 and 31 years old looking for a nice laid back escape. We're both professionals earning over six figures and typically go on a nice vacation twice a year. We stayed at the Fairmont in Maui and the Grand Hyatt in Kauai last summer. That was the most expensive trip either of us has ever taken. Usually we go to nice 4 star resorts. Westins or others in that class. The places we eat at home are what I would call fairly average. Good but not 5 star. You'll find us eating at places like Outback, Houstons, On The Boarder, and Maggianos to name a few of our favorites. Nothing too fancy. Once maybe twice a month tops we'll eat at a 5 star restaurant. For the sake of this article (places that people from all cities will know) I'll use Ruths Chris or a Mortons as an example. We like good food but it doesn't have to been high end. We love Mellow Mushroom (the local pizza join around the corner). So here's my review of the resort. I'll preface this by saying we were there less then 24 hours as we were extremely unhappy. Grounds: The resort itself is nice. The lobby was made to impress. Once the landscaping grows in the resort should look even better. Pool: Seemed really great! Beach: What beach? It was pathetic! If you like the beach don't go here. If you're fine by the pool it won't matter. Rooms: Rooms looked very nice too. I will say this. It was obvious to me that the idea is to make the resort look fancy and expensive as possible but the materials used were for the most part fake. For instance you walk into your room and you're wow'd cause it looks like wall to wall marble and wood but when you look closer it's all fake. I call this the supermodel effect. Dress it up to appear it's something it's not. All in all this didn't really bother me I just thought it was funny as we didn't really expect 5 star luxury. Here's where the first problem came in. The beds are PATHETIC!!! I've stayed at Best Westerns with better beds. The mattress was extremely hard which ok, I understand that some people like hard mattresses but it didn't even feel like a mattress. It was very very very weird to me. The sheets were like sleeping on sandpaper covered by more sandpaper. I got two hours sleep tops and my wife got less then that. Food: Like I said above we like food. And it doesn't have to be 5 star. I'd call Outback 3 to 3 1/2 star and it's one of our favorite places. We had breakfast lunch and dinner at this resort and all of the meals were terrible!!!!! I take that back, breakfast was so so. It's pretty hard to F up an egg. My original thought was as long as we can get a good dinner we'll be ok. This was not the case. People HEAR THIS WARNING!!!!!! If you think you're going to get average to good food you're wrong. Not to be rude or disrespectful to others but anyone who posted on this site and said the food was good has no clue what a decent meal is. If we call Outback a 3.5 star restaurant for the sake of example I'd have to call Sir Olivers the \"gourmet restaurant\" (all the staff members said it was the best at the resort) a 2 star at best. People, it's like eating is something you do in order to survive not because you enjoy it. Covering everything in butter in order to make it taste better is not what I call cooking. THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE!!!! Let me add this...my wife doesn't even eat meat, fish, or chicken. She's a vegetarian. She hated everything she had. We're talking vegetables here people. They can't even cook veggies well here. Overall: I would never go back and would never recommend to any of my friends or family. Like I said we checked out after a day. Bottom line is when I'm on vacation I want to feel sad when it's time to have to leave. I was ready to leave after one day! It's sad because they did a nice job with the resort itself. It's a nice looking place and the people working there all seemed very nice and attentive. One other note. We paid $370ish a night for the two of us and I understand that this was 50% off the regular rate. I felt it wasn't worth the price but if I had paid double I would have been going crazy!

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is beautiful, the people friendly and eager to help, service is prompt, check in is a breeze, check out even easier. The place is clean enough to see your reflection in the floor. The buffet was spectacular, breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Ala Cartes were also good, we preferred the Brazilian, but opted for the buffet at least twice for dinner. The bars had top shelf liquors and very friendly and accomodating bar tenders. Mini bar and fridge always stocked. The controversy about the beach surprises me. There is plenty of beach and the area behind the retaining wall is huge and the palm trees provide some shade. That will get better. I do see that they need to come up with a way to have more loungers around the pool as those who chose to sleep late did not get loungers and complained ad nauseum. This was complicated by days of strong wind which meant many people avoided the beach and wanted to be around the pool. The hotel is exquisite, chandeliers, carpets and art all from Spain.

We are 26 and 21 Couple. (Not looking for a party scene, but a romantic vacation with the option of a fun time, if wanted) Not traveled much. But Tons of research. We were here March 8-15 2006. The Resort: The hotel is gorgeous, marble and granite everywhere. Exquisite chandeliers as you enter the lobby, red velvet chairs, top dollar decorations can be seen at every angle. The exterior is the same, very fancy, granite outside, nice patio sets and fountains everywhere (all of which could not be ran while we were there due to it being too windy.) Check In: Was a breeze, no problems at all. Although the front desk was not at all informative, I knew more from reading this site, than from information given to us. We were brought a pretty orange non-alcoholic welcome drink. Appreciated after 15 hours of travel. The Room: We were first given a \u201crun of the house room\u201d which means the crappiest they have available, and it was. (Room 1017) Our room was looking at the Viva Azteca\u2019s Air conditioning system, and it was SOO loud. You could hear it even with the door closed. We called front desk to ask to be moved as we did not pay good money to be stuck in this type of room, and they said sorry, no. So we went 2 days, then went to the front desk , and made a serious complaint and were pressured to buy a more expensive room, after much rejection on our part, they gave us a room on the 3rd floor with an enclosed balcony (no view thru it, it is made of concrete) but it was facing inward towards the courtyard, so we were pleased. (room 3074) Pool: The pools are very nice, one is a very large pool, with built in sun loungers on both ends, the other is an infinity pool, set above the main pool. Water is WAY too cold\u2026 wow! The ocean water is SO much warmer. The last 3 days we were there, it was a bit warmer with absolutely no breeze, and the water felt ok then. (I know this is not just a personal opinion, as NO ONE was is the pool the first 3 days, Not even one person) The Pool Loungers: This is one of the most ridiculous parts of this resort, but we were prepared for it ahead of time. You are given towel cards, and trade them in when needed. Everyone uses their towels to SAVE the pool loungers. EVERY SINGLE lounger is reserved by 8:00 AM at the latest, umbrella or not. I actually stumbled out of bed one day at 6:30AM to try to get a better chair for the day, and 70% of them were already reserved. Unbelievable We knew this, and woke up early every day and were fine, but many that did not, were VERY angry to come to the pool at 9:00 am and see no chair in sight! The Beach: This is a very well discussed topic, so I will not go into it in detail. Yes, the beach at this resort is ridiculous, on the verge of un-usable. No one laid on the beach loungers our first days, as it was so windy sand went everywhere. (not the hotels fault obviously) We played in the water out front a few days, and there are tons of rocks and big things you cannot see all the time in the water. (I fell one day, and hit my head on a rock, producing blood. Again, my fault for being out there, but be careful) The Food: 3 Star at best. The buffets are only so-so. The breakfast buffet: Good in my opinion, my other half HATED it. I had pancakes, hash browns and fruit everyday, so I was happy. But he likes eggs and meat, both of which were not good at all. Lunch Buffet: My boyfriend liked this one, and I did not. He liked the chicken fajitas, but grew sick of them by the 7th day. The hamburgers are still bloody, and DO NOT TRY The hot dog, I\u2019m pre warning you. Same good fresh fruit as breakfast, also a GREAT ice-cream bar, delicious ice cream. Everyday for lunch, I ate French fries, fruit and ice cream. L Dinner Buffet: We only tried it twice and all I can say is No Thank You. Specialty Places: Brazilian: It is all different kinds of meats grilled on skewers. The pork was the only meat done. The turkey and chicken were so undercooked they were still pinky/purple. The Filet of steak was bright red/bluish. (no Joke) Okay for some, not me. Mexican: Good. Not traditional Mexican. My boyfriend ordered the Steak filet, and thought is was good. Ordered it well done and got it about med-well. So order one step above what you like. I got the bean burritos, very good. My boyfriend actually asked if he could also get some of these, they said no, but still good. The Steak House: Good. We both ordered Filet Mignon, well done. His was right, mine cam out, medium at most, I asked them to re-cook it, and they graciously did. Good soup at the buffet in this restaurant too. Only served at this dinner. The Japanese : Neither one of us liked this at all. (but we don\u2019t eat sushi) We were recommended the chicken teriyaki, so we both ordered that. NOT GOOD. But some people that we met while there, did like sushi and liked it, so it is all preference I would say. Overall: Not good food, we ate a lot in town. My boyfriend actually got sick from the food here, which made us decide it was time to start eating in town. The Drinks: Were much worse than we expected. They serve the weakest drinks, and if you ask them to make them stronger they just dump a bunch of liquor on top. They dont really know how to make mixed drinks. They do have top shelf liquors available. But they are a little stingy with the amount. Ok, but you dont need a bid mug, like alot of people say. Trust me. Oh, and they do not serve tequila boom booms at this resort. The Staff: Is excellent. HOLA Alex!! He works as the butler? By the front door, he hailed a cab for us into town quite a few times. And he went out of his way to say hi, every time he saw us. So overall we had a EXCELLENT vacation. We will NOT return to this resort again. Not near as impressed as we thought. This was the consensus of most we talked to. Not even sure if I will try a RIU again. Please feel free to ask me any questions.

Our first impressions: Architecture was amazing from the lobby to the plaza to the pools...one word describes it best \"GRAND\". To view this 'Palace' go to (--) website as the photo's on this website depict the true visual impression. Check-In: Went very smoothly and we were in our room within a half hour of arriving. We were very pleased that the first room we were assigned was perfect for us (inside room, opposite fountains and plaza, 2nd floor, and could actually see the ocean from our balcony). Luggage came up to our room a few hours later but not a big deal. Food: The Buffet restaurant and all the a la carte restaurants were very good, lots of choice, fresh produce, good cuts of meat. Only disappointment was the desserts they look great but taste of nothing, however there is always ice cream for those with a sweet tooth or the fresh fruit and chocolate fountain. Also, don't forget you can go to any of the other 4 Riu properties (within 10 minutes walk) and eat and drink at their buffet restaurant and bars...we ate and drank at Riu Palace Mexico a few times and it was very good. Bars: Service at all the bars was always A+, very friendly and helpful staff such as Carlos and Laurena. We found the best drinks were made at the Sports Bar from scratch (no pre-made mixes or slushy fountains)...I certainly can recommend the Pina Colada's and husband enjoyed Caesars (bloody marys made with clamato juice) made at the Sports Bar. Corona's always tasted great but we did find that the liquors i.e. Kahlua, Baileys, triple sec, etc. tasted weak or different to what we are used to. Housekeeping: Maid service was excellent. Room was always made up in the mornings usually while we were at breakfast, fresh towels each morning and evening, turn-down service every night with chocolates as well as three different 'towel animals'...what more could you ask for. One complaint from my husband who is a light sleeper...change the housekeeping cart wheels from plastic to rubber, currently the cart sounds like a freight train coming down the tiled hallway early in the mornings! Pools/Beach: Lovely pools and surrounding areas, lots of lounge chairs although scarce at times...we did not mind as we preferred to sunbathe on the beach which must have at least 500 loungers. Drinks service at the pool bar, around the pool and on the beach was excellent...I would recommend you take your own 'sippy cups' then drinks stay nice and cool - have them filled at the pool bar. The beach beyond the iron railing leading to the ocean is very small and rocky in areas...however a few minutes walk away is all the beach you can handle. Entertainment: Live music could be heard in the Plaza in the early evenings followed by live Riu Shows i.e. Grease, Mexican dancers, Michael Jackson, etc. at 10:00 pm each night. Local vendors came in and set-up stalls and were selling jewellery, pottery, local crafts twice while we were there. Location: Perfect central location in Playacar...just 7 minutes walk from the Playacar Shopping Plaza and telephones and a 15 minute walk from Playa Del Carmen.

The resort has recently opened and all of the facilties are complete and working. We have been to several AI 5 star resorts and this one still has room for improvements. I will not waste time and comment on areas that are already well documented, but will simply highlight certain areas that were important to us. Check-in was a breeze. Overall, the staff was very helpful and always had a smile. The buffets were the best part of the dining experience at this resort(never thought i'd ever say that). The Japanese restaurant was horrible...do not go. The French was ok but the lighting was too bright, so not very romantic. The beach area definitely is less than desirable as noted by several other writers. The lack of shade is a major problem for people who need some relief from the blazing sun. This seems to be the norm for Riu resorts, but I'm sure if the Riu family had to sit in the sun all day long, they would make a change immediately. They should come come up with a system to eliminate lounge hogging. Shouldn't have to get up early just to get a lounge with an umbrella. Although this problem exists at many other resorts, it should not be the norm at a truly 5 star resort. If you like to sleep in, you will have a problem. You will be woken up by carts that echo terribly travelling over the tile floors in the hallways . The same problem with the housekeeping staff that seem to yell to each other in the halls. The housekeeping was spotty, half the time with no turn down service and one day with the room not made up until 5pm. While the resort is beautiful, improvements need to be made to bring it up to a true 5 star resort.

We are 29 and 28 years old. We travel a lot and have stayed at 4 and 5 star resorts all around the world. Before leaving, I was hesitant based on the reviews coming out of Trip Advisor and Riubambu(-) Let me assure everyone that this is first class hotel. We have a fantastic time! Everything was great. As always, no resort ever has a perfect everything, but this came pretty close. Let me summarize... Food: Excellent! There are 5 restaurants. We ate at 4 of them. All except Japanese since we didn't go to Mexico to eat Japanese (we didn't eat Mexican when we were in Japan either). The steak, Sir Olivers and the Brazilian were all excellent. The steak restaurant actually surprised me. We weren't going to go as we questioned the quality of the meat. It was one of the best (and biggest) rib eyes I've ever had. The Mexican restaurant was just ok. The buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner were all excellent with a wide variety that changed daily. Nice bonus...an ice cream freezer at the buffets with 6 flavours. I made creamsicle floats for lunch (vanilla ice cream and orange soda). Try it. The reservation system has been resolved. It works great. You can reserve for the whole week at once. There is a woman in the lobby bar from 10am until 4pm taking reservations. You can only reserve 2 restaurants per day. Or you can just come back 3 hours later and have your wife reserve the other 2 restaurants like we did later that day. The only suggestion I would have is that you can reserve for any number of people that you like. I would prefer it if you could reserve any number of restaurants, but one person from each room had to be there to reserve it (not one person reserving for 8 people). The bars were also great with tons of choices and premium booze. Service: Very good, going to be excellent soon. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Staff at the bars and restaurants were constantly asking for suggestions and wanted to know how they were doing. The supervisors of each place ran a tight ship. I was impressed by how well the service was doing in such a short amount of time. The hotel director and public relations woman were always around, always. They watched everything. Rooms: Great. Stocked mini bar filled every second day. This was fine since they stocked it with about 10 soft drinks and 8 beers. Plus a liquor dispenser with top shelf brands like Cuervo and Bacardi. We had an ocean view room, 1045. The view was great and very close to the beach and pool. Entertainment: They had some pool animation, but not much. We liked this since we hate the noise at the pool all day long like at some other resorts. They played great music at the pool. We took a quick look at some of the shows at night. They were better than most other resorts, but still like a summer camp performance. My wife and I have a running joke that there is always a Michael Jackson impersonator at every resort in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. On the last night, guess what? A whole Michael Jackson show! They are going to flip out when they find out he is a pedophile. I guess they haven't gotten that news yet. Activities: Pretty good. We went sailing. I also went scuba diving with them one day. It was a operation. The last few days, there was too much wind for the water sports. They also target shooting every morning with an air rifle. It was pretty fun. Pool: Excellent. Huge with an infinity pool built into it about 6 feet higher. There are loungers built into the pool on either side. At the bar area (shallower) there are whirlpools and booths with tables to hang out at. The towel game is in full effect here. Let it be known that if you are the guy who travels in a group that wakes up at 6 am and reserves every chair at the pool for everyone in your large group, you are going to hell. As the week when one, the chair reserving got worse. My wife went down on the last day at 8am and there were 4 chairs left. The upside was, all you have to do is ask one of the staff and they'll grab a chair from the beach and bring it up for you. There were also a lot of umbrellas at the pool. They had staff that walked around and took drink orders. Nice touch! Beach: This is probably the biggest debate on the boards today. First, there IS shade on the beach. They have a ton of palm trees that are growing in. They each provide shade for at least one person. When it was really sunny, I moved over to another tree (about 10 feet away). They will grow in fully in the next couple of months and will provide a lot of shade. The second issue is the wall. For those of you that don't know, they built a retaining wall about 8 feet high. The beach is on top and then you walk down some steps to the water. Although this was different, it turned out to be great. The beach is private. No one can come up to sell you things. It is also quite large and immaculate. The hurricane moved the water line back up the whole coast. This wall will insure that the RPRM will have a great beach for years to come. We walked along the beach, down to the other Rius and other resorts. Our beach was by far the nicest. Others were now on steep angles or had large sand bags holding them together. There is an area on the north side on the beach to bring a lounger down closer to the water, but there are some rocks in that area (also good, since they are protecting the beach there). Best plans. Hit the beach in the AM. Eat lunch, and then hit the pool after 2 or 3 when the chair hogs clear out and there is plenty of space. Walking on the beach. You can do it when the weather is calm. There is a retaining wall down south a couple of resorts away that you can easily walk around when there is no wind. We did it and we could access all of the others Rius there. When the winds pick up (last couple of days for us) the beach is very windy and water gets rough. We had the same happen 6 years ago when we stayed at Barcelo in the Mayan Riviera as well. Nightlife: There is a night club at another Riu, we didn't go. We did walk to town a few times (10 minutes). It has developed a LOT in the last 6 years. There is a street about 30 blocks long with shopping, restaurants and bars. There is something for everyone. Kids: We don't have any and don't really want to hang out other people's kids on vacation. There were a good number of kids, but they didn't really bother us. The \"screaming when jumping in the pool\" routine that many kids have to do, was kept to a minimum. Overall, not bad. If you have kids, they'll have fun. Just remember, everyone is on vacation. If you kid is screaming for a half hour and you can't get them to stop, bring them to your room. Don't just ignore them (you know who you are). Excursions: We did the Coba tour with AllTourNative (google it). They have small groups. It was a great day. We also did Xcaret. Fantastic. There is a lot to see. The show at the end of the day was excellent. We visited Xel-Ha last time. The decision is easy to make. If you want to snorkel and see fish, go to Xel-Ha. If you want to see a lot of animals and stay later to see the show, go to Xcaret. That pretty much sums it up.
