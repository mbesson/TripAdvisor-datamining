We spent a birthday weekend with our son and spouse and found the staff extremely welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was very good except for the sliced bread which was dry (in a country with the best bread in the world) The rooms were clean and airy and well and well decorated. Immediately opposite - Cafe Bistro 1900 is a lovely place to hang out and drink iced fruit tea and eat asparagus in season. It's near to some wonderful restaurants and the S- Bahn but good for parking and peaceful. Highly recommended", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lima, ohio", "Title": "\u201cUniformly excellent\u201d", "Author": "ohiobillLima_Ohio", "ReviewID": "UR57992857", "Content": "The Hotel Aida is located,a short 2 block walk from the Savignyplatz S-bahn station, making it very convenient to all of Berlin. The neighborhood is safe and the hotel itself is in a 100+ year old building that has been renovated without losing any of its charm. Reception is 1 flight up, where you will be greeted by competent and professional staff. I do not remember an elevator. The rooms, which are located on the reception and ascending floors, are very clean and the bathrooms are immaculate. They are decorated in muted colors which provide a very pleasant ambience. Breakfast is very good with an especially large variety of fruit, as well as breads, pastrys, meats and cheeses. There is a computer with internet access which is available for a small fee. Perhaps most indicative of the staffs care was the setting of a table for a family with a young girl, The table was fixed with a Hello Kitty motif, including a stuffed animal. The rates were very reasonable. This hotel is an excellent choice when visiting Berlin.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201chighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "lglasgow1982", "ReviewID": "UR52561226", "Content": "Stayed in the Hotel Aida for 4 nights at the beginning of December and cant recommend it enough! Its situated in the nice quiet area of Sauvingnyplazt. The hotel its self is super clean, the rooms lovely and modern and very well heated. Theres lots of examples of beautiful Stucco plaster in the dining room and each floor. The room where breakfast is served is a good size, we never had trouble finding a seat and the breakfast is excellent, even as the time came for breakfast to finish, the staff were still toping up the plates for people to choose from. There was everything from fresh fruit, breads,cakes, yoghurts, fresh meat and cheeses, pickles, fresh fruit juices and a selection of teas and coffees. The dining room also serves as a bar. It wasnt ever busy when we were there but the girl who served us remembered our order each night which was nice. The prices are very good as well 2.10euros for a large bottle of beer. You can also take your order up to your room which i liked as well. Theres many restaurants around the hotel, we never tried the one at the entrance to the hotel, but only because it was full every night we were there, if you stay here you HAVE to go to the 12 apostels pizzeria which sells possibly the best pizza i have ever tried! The hotel is also right next to sauvingyplatz train station and within walking distance of the zoo station. the hotel is situated on a quite street and myself and my boyfriend felt safe walking there late at night. and as its off the main street you arent bothered by any traffic noise. if you want to stay in the area the hotel is in, then i highly recommend you stay at this hotel! oh by the way the staff are lovely and very friendly and always greet you with a smile! i also emailed with a query about public transport before i arrived and got a quick, polite and very helpful response.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellegarde - France", "Title": "\u201cExcellet Hotel in Savigny Platz Berlin\u201d", "Author": "Patimac", "ReviewID": "UR17019411", "Content": "I have just arrived from a weekend in Berlin at this excellet hotel.
