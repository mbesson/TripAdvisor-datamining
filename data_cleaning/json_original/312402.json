Jobs worths - feel really sorry for them as they obviously don't want to work in customer service. Another excuse is \"come back in 3 hours\". It's a joke.

We booked using hotels.com so we got a good deal, but I would have been extremely annoyed if we'd paid full price. Whilst the location looks great on a map, in reality there are prostitutes everywhere and as soon as you step out of the hotel you can smell urine (we actually saw several people urinating in the street: under cars, against walls, in doorways - you name it). There is also a lot of grafitti, but this is true of Madrid as a whole. The hotel itself also had a funny smell in reception, not quite sure what it was. It smelt like some kind of cleaning product which should be a good thing but it was very overpowering and gave me a headache whenever we passed through! Our room and the corridors were also very scruffy (lots of peeling paint etc.): this hotel is in serious need of doing up. I would certainly not say it is a 3 star - this rating was obviously awarded to the hotel a while ago. Also, there were no English channels on the TV. The only bonus was that our room was very big. The biggest problem we encountered was that despite booking a double room we were allocated a twin; when we asked to move we were told that there were no double rooms left. The staff weren't very helpful, in fact they were quite abrupt and rude.

As for the hotel, it is really average...It has recently been refurbished - I was there in march 2007 - and the rooms look nice. The bathrooms are not big but functional... I always ask for a quiet room, as those on the street side can be very noisy... Madrid is a party party city ! I have had a couple times a nice little room with a nice private bathroom for around Euros 70.- or something. The breakfast is standard, but very nice... Last time Iberia lost my luggage, they were of great help to retrieve it! I recommend hotel laris... If you're in Madrid for the week end, I also recommend having a look at the Church of San Antonio de la Florida,located on the Paseo de la Florida (open on Sundays from 10-12) and having lunch at the restaurant next to it . This church is a unique item, where Goya painted the whole ceiling. The colors go from bright blue to black ( Goya suffered depression before he died). The restaurant next to it is specialised in barbecue chicken, excellent spanish cheese, and almond tart. !

The hotel was situated just one minute walk from the Gran Via, so in that sense it had a very good location. The drawback was that the neighborhood was a rather bad one, with hookers just around the corner. I wouldn't feel to safe walking alone to the hotel at night, and as I had a room overlooking the road beneath there was a lot of noise from drunks and the hookers. Entering the hotel, it seemed very nice with a small, but newly refurbished lobby with modern decor. Walking up the stairs (the hotel had one elevator, but it was occupied), the hotel begun to show that it was worn, and entering my room was a bit of a letdown. My room was actually quite large, with a (french) balcony overlooking the street and tv. However, as my pictures show, the room was very worn. The ceiling had a hole covered partially by a brown cardboard box, the toilet had a wooden cover that was ducktaped together, and the carpet was stained. As I was taking off the bedspread, I saw a pubic hair under the blanket, as well as several other hairs. As I was a little disgusted and wondered if they had actually changed the linen, I went down to the reception and explained the situation and requested a new blanket. The manager(?) didn't speak any English, so I explained in simple Spanish. He didn't take me very serious, and told me that they wouldn't clean the room before next morning. After 15 minutes, he called a friend who spoke English to translate what we said to each other. No help to get there. I had to wake my spanish-speaking teacher, and after 5 minutes I got a new blanket. I've never encountered such bad service... The next morning, the breakfast was actually quite good from the small buffet. Considering the price, the hotel was very good value, but the neighborhood, service, unclean and worn room lets down. I heard that many of the other rooms were newly refurbished, so maybe I was unlucky with my room.
