I stayed here for business and was lucky enough to be moved there. It's a real shame because the hotel is in a brilliant location. Right by the square, and what I call kebab ally.

The night receptionnist was really friendly so we agreed to take one suite room for 4 persons and one double room for 2 for three nights with possiblity of extension. It turns out superb. The room is clean, comfortable and spacious with view at Bosphorus. The concierge said this hotel opened only 2 months ago. Ok, so we expected good services that can boost their reputation. BUT!!! Had safety box problem, asked for help, no one came. Room cleaners turned the A/C off everytime they passed by even if it's 34\u00c2\u00b0C outside! Asked to extend our stay but they decided to change the suite for 4 into a suite for 3 plus a foldable bed but for the same price saying that the previous suite was already booked a month ago by a family. No security in front of the hotel at night even though they're right in front of Taksim square. Not much variation of the breakfast each morning. Still lot of missing things for this hotel to make it look professional (no hotel brochure, no list of things in the mini bar, no telephone access). When we tried to deal our extended stay, they changed the receptionnist 3 times so that no one knows about our specific request. AND on top of all, they charged us 40 euros of stuff we \"tooked\" from the mini bar when we don't even remember the existence of it. Didn't pay, signed the paper that we had nothing to do with it and took the exit door as to never come back.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cIstanbul's most secure hotel..

The staff is very young, and is unhelpful to the point of hostility. We stayed on New Year's Eve, and were booked into a tiny interior room barely large enough for the bed. The room was as hot as a sauna, and it was impossible to sleep, even after the ill tempered staff finally produced a fan. The New Year's Eve party on the top floor echoed through the hotel's hollow interior, so our entire night we endured thumping bass. For this miserable, exhausting experience, we paid $145. The next morning, after inquiring at the front desk about laundry service, we turned over about 15 items to be laundered. They were returned one hour later, along with a bill for $142 (that's U.S. dollars).

I thought the hotel was incredibly overpriced for what I got (and I paid a discount to the rack rate), and would rank it by US standards as a 1 or 1.5 star hotel at best. (As an aside, do not believe the star rankings on any Turkish hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c using a scale based on the \u00e2\u20ac\u01534 star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u01535 star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels I stayed at in Turkey, something like the Ritz-Carlton would be around 20 stars. Meanwhile, the Taxim Hill is rated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and if you think about what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special education\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means or meant in the United States, you'll get the picture!) The hotel is directly on Taxim Square across from the monument, and the taxis and the traffic and the horns and the people and the police/ ambulance/ fire sirens never stop - the noise is incredible. Even with the windows closed, the curtains drawn, and earplugs from the plane flight in place, I was unable to sleep, and it was too loud to talk on the telephone in my room which was in the front of the hotel. The back rooms are apparently quieter than the front rooms but it was all relative - you still wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave the windows open due to the noise from the air conditioners on the surrounding buildings and from the overflow noise from Taxim Square. There were also a couple of extremely tiny inside rooms on most floors that opened on the central airshaft/ lobby that runs the entire height of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thankfully I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in one of them but I saw them when the maid was cleaning, and they were probably 8 foot square at best, and I would imagine they were also very noisy since the hotel lobby was loud, the elevators ran through the lobby/ airshaft and the top floor restaurant became a disco after hours. The rooms are idiosyncratic (each one I saw had a different layout), but all shared being small with filthy carpet, moldy dirty bathrooms, peeling/ torn/ dirty wall paper, and rock-hard beds with thin pillows. The AC either does not work or barely works (including in the lobby), and you cannot open the windows due to the noise. The internet is sporadic - some rooms have wired internet that works, some rooms have wired internet that doesn't work, and some rooms have unsecured wireless internet that may or may not work (this includes the lobby!) I had better luck pirating a signal from one of the adjacent buildings than I did connecting to the Taxim Hill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet, and everyone else I talked to also had internet connection issues. There are no smoke-free rooms or areas and the lobby reeks. (While the breakfast restaurant is posted as smoke-free, you would never be able to tell by the smell.) As soon as someone in one of the adjacent rooms lit up, my room immediately filled with smoke. There is no in-room safe so the only option for valuables is to take them with you or leave them with the front desk (which also didn't have a safe but where the desk staff said they would watch them.) However since there wasn't anyone behind the front desk half of the time I went past it, I lugged my laptop all over Istanbul!)However each room did have an overpriced in-room mini-bar. (The hotel obviously had its priorities straight for the business travelers it supposedly caters to!) While friendly, the staff may or may not speak English and may or may not be helpful. The breakfast is included but was very indifferent and did not change from day to day. Only pluses - the breakfast room does have a nice view of the Bosporus, and being directly on Taxim Square meant the train and buses were directly across the street and Istikal Caddesi (sort of the Rodeo Drive of Istanbul) was around the corner, giving you an infinite number of dining choices above and beyond the Taxim Hill's restaurant.", "Date": "August 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel I have ever stayed in\u201d", "Author": "peterg44", "ReviewID": "UR17259409", "Content": "I stayed only one night after seeing the awful room presented to me.

The food is okay, but it's the same every day and by the end of the first week I was bored enough to start skipping breakfast. But the views from the restaurant are spectacular! One side looks over Taksim Square and the other side has views of the Bosphorus Strait. My room was small. I had 2 single beds without enough room to hide my suitcase. But my travelling companions had larger rooms, and mine was okay for just me. I also had problems with the water, it took a long time to get hot water. I was also unable to connect to the internet from my room, but I had an old laptop, and again my travelling companions were luckier than I. The furnishings were nice and modern. I had a desk and armoire, and the bed had a featherbed. Speaking of friendly staff, someone saw me going to one of the other rooms in my sock feet, and the next day the maid had left slippers for me! The location in Taksim Square is an ideal location for exploring Istanbul. It's near most of the foreign embassies. It's also the one location in the city that taxi drivers never get lost trying to find. Across from the hotel is the top of Istiklal Caddesi, a busy shopping street with hundreds of opions for meals.
