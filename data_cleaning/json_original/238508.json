Upon departure there were hugs, kisses and thank yous with promises to return from everyone. The staff was happy to make dinner reservations, give advice, call for taxis and really anything that you needed. The location is amazing. On a quiet street just 1/2 block from the top of the Spanish Steps. There were 2 cafes in the square at the top of street that were very good and we stopped in everyday for our pre dinner cockatails and people watching. The waiters greeted us every time like old friends and could not have been nicer. Hotel Gregoriana is walking distance to everything and the fact that it is on a quiet street but not far from all that Rome has to offer is a real bonus.

I called downstairs, and someone came to see it and told me that eventually the water would drain and the plug could be pryed out. Next, I looked around the room for an Iron to press a shirt for dinner. The man at the desk (there was nobobdy else working in the hotel) said that the cleaning staff had already left the hotel and there was no Iron. When I persisted, he called the manager on the phone and the manager basically laughed and said there was no services at that time of night (This was 5:30 in the afternoon on a Sat) Just the week before My crew and I stayed at The Bailey's Hotel in Rome and they are the best kept secret in Rome. The Bailey's Hotel is much cheaper than the Gregoriana and in a great location. The only thing the Gregoriana has going for it is the proximity to the Spanish Steps.

The hotel has been recently refurbished: the single room I had had a parquetry floor, a comfortable bed with a beautiful parquetry bedhead and lovely pictures on the wall - all connected to a kind of 1940's-1950's retro kind of theme, and all immaculately clean and even pretty. Beautiful heavy fabric curtains - and a window that looked out onto the street. Via Gregoriana is a small street that is one of two that leads away from the top of the Spanish Steps; the other one has one of those hugely expensive, swanky hotels. This street has no other hotels at all and, thus, at night there is virtually no noise at all; I did not hear another noise at night from other guests, either - and, so, if you want to stay in a place where people are quietly well-heeled without being painful or inconsiderate, this place will suit. Breakfast is not a great event - a little basket of pastries, toast with condiments, etc. and coffee/tea but, in a sense, the whole of Rome is 5 minutes walk away and, so, if you want something else, you can go and get it.
