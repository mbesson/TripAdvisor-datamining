Emilio recommended the sights we needed to visit and was spot on. He also told us about a restaurant round the corner and it proved to be a little gem. Our rooom faced the street and it was noisy. However, with the windows closed and the air-con working it wasn't a problem. Breakfast was 'continental' and always a pleasant start to the day. It does get busy at certain times but it wasn't an issue for us. The location was perfect, close enough to the sights without the premium price and with the train and bus station a few minutes walk away, we saved a few pounds by getting the Terravision coach in and out from the airport and took buses to some of the more far flung places like the Vatican.

Location is brilliant. A few minutes away from termini. 10 minute walk to Colluseum, 15 minute walk to Trevi fountain, 20 minutes to pantheon in one direction or travestere in another, 30 minute walk to Vatican. Breakfast was everything I expected of a continental breakfast- cereal, fruit salad, fresh fruit, juices, cereal, croissant and yogurts. Unsure why people here didn't like it. We couldn't fault it. The staff were great. Very attentive and helpful. Take the map in the lobby- it's the best one we found. And use the restaurant round the corner that is recommended- best pizza we had with cheap wine. We had booked the economy room. So between that and reading these reviews I was prepared for it to be small. But was extremely clean. The shower was good and powerful. Had an easy to use safe. I'm glad we took our little laptop with some programmes loaded on as the only English speaking channels on the tv were BBC world news and CNN news. The only fault I could have was there were times I was gasping for a cup of tea in the evenings and there was no kettle in the room. But looking at their face book page I believe that is soon changing. All in all a great hotel for holidays.

The Hotel Amalfi is a small pleasant hotel with excellent service and exceptional cleanliness. We took the bus from Flumincino airport to Termini Station for 4 euros each as it was outside rush hour times and we were not hurrying. Bus took 40 mins but didn\u2019t seem to have a timetable so had to wait 30 mins for it. Hotel is a 5 minute walk from Termini. We took the Leonardo Express train from Termini on return which took 30 mins and cost 14 Euros each. Our room at the front was small and the bathroom very small, especially the shower, but as we only needed the room to return to sleep and freshen up it was perfect. The weather was exceptionally warm during the day (24c in March) and so was the room but if you suffer the noise with a window open for ten minutes it cools. Shut the windows, blinds and curtains and there is next to no noise at night. Cosimo greeted us on arrival and within a few minutes we were checked in with maps and directions for everywhere we might visit and discount voucher for their recommended restaurant (Il Nipotino, reviewed separately). The only disappointment with the hotel was breakfast, lukewarm coffee, packaged meat and cheese and possibly also the croissants. Fresh produce was rolls and some fruit but all ok and plenty for the start of day. Also the breakfast room gets busy if you\u2019re not early and sometimes people had to wait for a table. Tripadvisor doesn\u2019t seem to allow for total trip reports so I include our trip highlights here. We did not book any organised tours, did not use a taxi, metro or bus, just walking. The advantage of this is finding wonderful narrow streets with antiques or specialist shops for a myriad of things. The hotel is within walking distance (if reasonably fit) from all sights but plan your trip. The map from the hotel was also excellent. On the afternoon of Day 1 (after a light lunch) we visited the Colesseum, Forum and Palantine true ancient wonders, then wandered down to the stunning Piazza Venezia. Day 2 was an early start to Campo dei Fiori market (slightly disappointing as there were very few flower stalls, Piazza Navonna (beautiful church and fountains} and Pantheon (impressive with the xylophone player out front). We then went on to the Vatican Museum/Sistine Chapel for a 1pm booking(allow at least 2 hours here and be prepared for a sore neck from looking at the ceilings), back to St Peters Basilica and then late afternoon climb Castel de Sant\u2019Angelo for great views and beautiful cupid statue. Day 3 was St Maria Maggiore early, the beautiful basilica closest to the Hotel then along to the Trevi Fountain (where we actually managed to stand by the edge and throw coins in) then up to Piazza d\u2019Espagna/Spanish Steps followed by the calming Piazza del Popolo. From here we walked towards Villa Medici through the gardens where we found a treasure of an oasis in Casina dell Orologio in Via Orologio. This beautiful bar/restaurant was the most attractive and cheapest place for a drink that we found (only 5 euro for a coffee and glass of wine) so we took some time resting here! Finished the day with a walk down Via Corso for shops (not as good as side streets) and the Presidential palace Quirinale to see the guards (couldn\u2019t see them). Skip the Line? What line? The only place we booked tickets for was the Vatican Museum/Sistine Chapel as we knew our time was tight. Did this online with the official Musei.Vaticani site for a reservation fee of 4 euros (total 18.00 euros each) but didn\u2019t need it, walked straight in. Longest queue was into St Peters which was 10 minutes! Assume queues were short as it was pre Easter time. A really great trip and a hotel which was excellent value for money.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location, friendly & helpful staff, good value and clean\u201d", "Author": "JandLN", "ReviewID": "UR127081297", "Content": "We stayed in an economic double room which was small but fine as we were out sightseeing most of the time!

We were not disappointed. When we arrived, we were greeted at the front desk and given loads of information to help us navigate the city. We were also given a great restaurant recommendation that was just down the street as it was late and we were starving. The room was good, small, but standard for Europe. Bathroom was good sized, bigger than what we had in our previous two European hotels. The room was a little musty, but not too bad. It was very hot out, so we did have the air conditioner cranked up. My one issue with the room was that the shower only had a hand-held nozzle and a shower curtain instead of a shower door, and it was difficult to manuever without spraying the water towards the back wall. It took a few times, and we could tell we weren't the only ones to have trouble. This was not a huge deal to us, though. The breakfast was included on the price of our room, and it did not disappoint. It was continental style with cereal, pastries, coffee, tea, juice, etc. We were very happy to be able to enjoy this each morning. The staff in the breakfast room was also very helpful and friendly. The hotel was in a pretty good location for us. It was within walking distance to Termini station, but also within walking distance to many of the sights. We walked almost everywhere. On our last day, our flight was later so we were able to keep our luggage at the hotel while we were out. The staff also arranged for airport transport for us, which picked us up at the door. We were able to utilize the lounge area while waiting for this, as well, and they have a very nice, good sized bathroom that we could change and freshen up in after our day out before leaving for the airport.

There is a small life (1 person/1 case), the room had a double bed but again was very small with a small but fully eqipped bathroom. The hotel is on a traffic-busy road but don't worry there was NO noise inside the hotel - only the other guests going up and down the stairs. The breakfast was basic but certainly adequate to fill up till lunch. The location of the hotel I found perfectly adequate for exploring Rome. I took the No40 bus to the Vatican and walked back - this took in St Peters, Castel Sant Angelo, Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Vittorio Emanuele Monument, the Colosseum and loads more delights in between. You can do all this in one day quite easily without any rush and loads of food and ice-cream in between. Restaurants - for close to the hotel I would ask at the hotel reception - I was given a card for a place in a near by street - I introduced myself from the hotel and was looked after - the hotel clearly took the introduction seriously. There are loads of good places to eat - but beware in taking a look - like anyware there appeared to be the full range.

It's a smallish hotel with a very convenient location for the tourist wanting to explore Rome. If you just step out the hotel, you already see Santa Maria Maggiore on your left and most places interesting to tourists, such as the Colosseum are at walking distance from there. The Amalfi hotel is relatively small. The furnishing is bit old but have a bit of old world charm about it. I had a single room which wasn't huge but there was sufficient storage, a good bathroom and even a balcony. I'm a bit of a \"clean freak\" and even I was impressed how immaculately clean everything was. There was not even a speck of mould in the bathroom, where most hotels fail this test. The airconditioning was effective and not too noise and gave a welcome reprieve from the late summer heat. The staff was friendly and there was a relaxed familiy atmosphere about the place. They were very accomodating (but Romans are easy going people in general - no problem is insurmountable) and either helped me directly or gave good advice that helped me to sort out questions and problems tourists might have. E.g. one day i had a day trip (which they helped to arrange) and I had to leave much earlier than the start of breakfast. The staff on duty insisted that I didn't leave with empty stomach and even packed me a few bites for the road. :-) The people on duty at the front desk were speaking good English although one person didn't seem to understand the concept of late check-out. Still, the problem was solved to my satisfaction, so no complaints. I noticed the place is very popular with Brittish and Australian tourists. If you are the sort of person who wants an army of hotel staff looking after you, a gym with an olympic size pool, a floor manager who is always on duty etc. than maybe this is not the hotel for you but if you are a tourist wanting to explore Rome, who wants a comfortable crash pad which is clean and has a friendly atmosphere, Hotel Amalfi is a great choice.

The hotel itself is tiny in every respect. A tiny reception lead to a miniscule lift - the smallest I have ever seen. We tried to put two suitcases and one person in the lift and it was impossible. The room was very small indeed. We had a double bedroom and although the bed wasn't absolutely up against the wall it was hard to walk round it to get in. There were all kinds of things wrong with the room - bumps in the plaster, a bit of skirting board that kept falling off. The television couldn't be turned round to give a good view because it was half behind the curtains because of the small room. At first sight the bathroom looked o.k. but the plunger nob in the washbasin was missing so you had to push a sharp spike to empty the basin . When you did empty the basis the floor flooded as there was an overflow plate in the tiled floor and this was soon awash. Plus points - very helpful reception staff (although I don't think they would have been so helpful or friendly if you complained) and an excellent lady who served breakfast. She was the star of this hotel.; The breakfast room was very small and people often had to wait for tables to be free to eat their meal. The breakfast rolls are appalling. Aerated, hollow and hard. Usually for us the Italian breakfast is the highlight of the stay - not this time. The rooms looked clean enough but the net curtains were sepia throughout the hotel. Tremendous traffic noise and dirt. Advertised as having a roof terrace - don't be fooled. The lift doesn;t go all the way up to the terrace and you have to wedge the door open or it slams behind you and then you're up there for ages.

Step out the front door, look to your left, and in front of you is the Santa Maria Maggiore. The bus stop is across the street, and the shop to purchase your metro tickets (tabbachi) is just two or three shops away from the hotel. Lots of restaurants and shopping are right in the area, and when you get tired of pasta and gelato, there is a lovely schwarma (gyro) shop in the same block as the hotel. Rooms are small and in European fashion, there are no washcloths as what you would see in the U.S. Admittedly, the room for single use looks like a dorm room from college years, however, the room was spotless, and the bed sheets were crisp and clean. The staff? Very friendly and accommodating. While I don't have any names, the front desk clerks and the lovely woman in the restaurant were all eager to please. I had an early morning flight back to the US. The hotel arranged a taxi for me, the taxi arrived promptly on time, and the gentleman at the front desk even called my room to advise me that the taxi was waiting! There was breakfast served in the restaurant. Typical continental fare \u2013 muffins, danishes, cereal, fruit cocktail, cheese and salami, and orange juice and fresh peaches \u2013 and it was enough to keep you going until your next meal. The beds? Well...I'm not used to firm mattresses, so sleeping was a little tough for me, but hey \u2013 you're not in Rome to sleep, right? FYI - there is free WiFi at the hotel, but if you don't have a laptop, there is an internet cafe approx. four blocks away. Also, the Tourist Information booth is three blocks away from the hotel. The Not So Great: Be careful of any room on the first floor. While clean as described above, the problem is that they are, quite literally, five steps away from the front desk. As a result, you can hear every conversation that takes place, and that can be a problem if, for example, you want to turn in and have an early night. Also, there are skylights in Rooms 101 and 102 (not sure of the others), so again, if you want to turn in early, you still have natural light streaming into the room. Overall: Would I recommend? Yes!

The bathroom seemed newly renovated and also very clean. They have the BEST windows. We could open the windows to hear the bustling of the street, but after closing, it was so quiet! I was surprised! The location of this hotel is great! Being so close to the termini is a huge asset because if you get a three day bus pass (which we did) and learn the bus system, you can get to everything you want to see very quickly. Bus 40 is the bus that takes you to the Vatican and it was a quick trip. You can catch the 714 bus to get to the termini and then catch it to get back to the hotel (exiting the bus a the maria maggiore stop) if you didn't want to walk to the termini, though it is an easy walk. The breakfast was good. Cereal, pastries, fruit. The lady at breakfast is SO NICE! what a pleasant face to see in the morning! :o) My only complaint is that there isn't someone at the desk at all times when they really need to be since they collect the keys for the day. We were pretty sad to come in one day to see that we could easily just grab our key on our own without anyone seeing. Made us feel a little less secure about our things. But other than than, this hotel exceeded my expectations and I will definitely return to this hotel on my next visit to Rome. Thank you for the good service! PS -- Watch out for the cabbies when you arrive into Rome via the train station. ENSURE that they will use the meter because it should be less than 10 Euro.

The hotel is on a busy road but we didn't hear any traffic noise and it is in walking distance of the Colliseum, Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. We only gotone bus to get to the Vatican (book in advance and look for the group entrance to the Vatican Museums on the right hand side of St Peters Square through the archway). We ended up taking a guided tour which we were a bit unsure about at first but it turned out to be a good move as the museum was so crowded we would'nt have managed to see the best bits without our guide pointing them out. The Colliseum was amazing, again we booked in advance which meant we went through the group entrance and sailed past the queues. Our tip would be to not be suckered into having a picture taken (with your own camera) with the guys dressed as gladiators - 20 euros each if your'e daft enough to pay it!! We were recommended by Guiseppe, (the chap on evening hotel duty) to eat at a restuarant just down the road 'Spaglio et Frisio'? which was an experience we won't forget, food was good but what made it memorable was the piano playing and being serenaded at the table by a small roman gentlemen-three coins in a fountain in Italian was priceless having just visited the Trevi Fountain earlier in the day!

However once inside it is very beautiful. We were greeted at reception by a lovely lady who took time with us to welcome us and show us all the sights on a map. She was really helpful and it was a great first impression. Our room was on the 4th floor and faced the street. There is a very small lift which can hold 2 people. The bathroom in our room was lovely, very new and clean with a fantastic shower. There was almost no road noise due to the good windows. We don't really watch TV but they had some music channels and sport which was good for me! Also the mini bar had nice cold beer which was very reasonable. It also had an electronic safe. Breakfast was very nice and again there is a really friendly and lovely lady who tends to breakfast. She was so friendly and helpful! There were sweet and savoury croissants, cold meats and cheeses, rolls, bread and hot coffee. I thought for the cost of the room it was much better than expected. Location is very good also. You are a 10 minute walk to the main Roma Termini station. You can actually see Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore from the room and that is worth a visit. The Coloseum is about 25 minutes walk away. Everything is within easy reach either walking or by Metro. We walked from the Vatican to the hotel on our last day, stopping by Trevi fountains and Spanish steps on the way. We ate at a couple of local restaurants to the hotel - one was a deli/bar type place called L'Esquilino Ristorante which was a couple of streets away on Via Cavour and was excellent. We also ate at another place which was about 105 Via Cavour (Gallo Mallo or something) and that was great. Once we cracked a few jokes with the waiter he became really friendly there. I think you need to have a sense of humour to get on well with Romans. We also met two gentlemen on the hotel reception desk. Both were very friendly and helpful and allowed us to keep our luggage in the hotel when we went out on our last day. Considering everything with this hotel I really feel it deserves top marks.

Some of the best options were fully booked so I plumped for the Amalfi where we stayed for 5 days. Firstly I should start with the positives of this hotel. Its less than 10 mins walk to the Termini station - great both for travel to the airport but also for the numerous buses that depart. Its also a stones throw from Santa Maria Maggiore (well worth a visit). its also within walking distance of numerous trattorias (try to get away from the main streets for the best places). Then to the negatives. We booked a twin room but in reality it was a double room. If you are intending to share a room with someone who you are not really close to I would think again. There were two beds but they were jammed up together. We tried to put a bit of space in between but without fail the maid put them together again. The room was also very small but I guess that is a given for Rome. The room was stifling hot. It apparently had aircon but this was not controllable. For the first few nights we tried having the window open but the road noise was loud to say the least. On a plus note if you need to get laundry dry it dried in the room in a couple hours! I am surprised by the reviews of breakfast being good. It was exactly the same every day for 5 days we were there. No fresh fruit at all just some tinned stuff. All the meats and cheeses were processed and in packaging. One kind of juice if you can call it juice as it tasted like rather strong orange squash. The breakfast room is also fairy small and on a couple mornings we noticed a few poor couples having to queue for tables which I think is not acceptable in a 3 star expensive hotel. FInally for my complaints would be the lady on reception when we checked out. She was beyond rude about paying for room tax.

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Upon our arrival we received a mini orientation of Rome from the front desk attendant. I believe his name was Francisco but I can't remember. Everyone else that worked there was helpful as well. Our room was clean and it had the best windows I've seen in a hotel. This is important because the hotel is on a very busy street but the window kept all the noise out. It also literally had 6 different curtains and shades to keep the sun out. The hotel is located about 5 blocks from the Termini train station which is the main transportation hub of Rome. It's also about a 15 min walk from the Coliseum. It's further away from the other sites (Vatican, Trevi Fountain, and Spanish Steps). The immediate area around Termini (within a block or two) is a little sketchy but we never felt uncomfortable. Two things that threw us off a little about Amalfi: 1. The bed: it wasn't a true king size bed but 2 double beds pushed together. You can feel the divide down the middle. We were so tired everyday that it didn't matter but it was a little uncomfortable. 2. You have to leave your key with the Front Desk before you leave everyday. I've never experienced that at a hotel before. There's someone on duty 24hrs a day so we never had a problem getting into the hotel but it took a day to get used to. It actually turned out to be pretty good as we never had to worry about losing our key. Also be aware that the elevator is TINY, so be prepared to make a lot of trips if you have a bunch of luggage. Overall I would recommend Amalfi to others. It's a nice hotel with a dedicated staff.

Our room was a \"double standard\" located on the top floor, a decent size and comfortable even for two singles pushed together (which we weren't expecting). The bathroom had a shower, toilet, sink and bidet (for those that use such things). We had a charming view of the Santa Maria Maggiore (see picture), one of the largest churches in Italy, which served a more than adequate alarm clock. As with most places in Rome, roads are noisy but the sound-proofing in the room is very good. The TV didn't carry any English channels like Sky News, CNN or BBC News 24. We found the staff to be very helpful, during check-in the information was clear and detailed. They recommended a nearby Pizzeria and offered us a 10% discount if we ate there. Should you find yourself without dinner plans and want to grab something quick to eat, there are plenty of places to grab a bite although you might have to travel to the Barberini, Spagna or Piazza Navona areas for something more hearty. Included in the price was a free continental breakfast with croissants, bread, rolls, cheese, pate, cakes, biscuits, fruit and cereal served daily 7:30-9:30am. You will also find a steady stream of free tea and coffee served with a smile. The Amalfi hotel only had six tables for Breakfast and seemed a little busy on Sunday morning but the lady serving Breakfast had a cheery attitude and buzzed around keeping everyone topped up with tea and coffee. To service four floors there is a flight of stairs and one small lift, with a capacity for two people each with a suitcase, although if you've stayed in a boutique hotel before you would know what to expect. From the hotel, you'll find both the Colosseum and the Roman Forum a firm 15-minute walk. The nearest subway/tube stop is back at the Termini, we only used it once and that was to visit the Vatican which is completely the other side of Rome. The Metro costs 1 Euro per person and because it doesn't run through Rome we walked to most places, although Taxi's (official ones are White with a yellow light on top) are always available.

I was worried that the actual hotel wouldn't be as nice as the photos, but I was wrong. Amalfi Hotel exceeded my expectations. The hotel is small, but charming.

The hotel is family-run and their care for their business and customers is evident. The rooms were bigger than I thought and perhaps just a tad smaller than standard-sized ones in the US. Overall, we were very happy with our rooms. We had plenty of hanging closet space (though no dresser). The bathrooms were extremely clean and chic. Everyday my husband and I marveled at my find; all of us were happy with our stay at Hotel Amalfi. There didn't seem to be too many (good) restaurants nearby (but a lot of quick food), although many places were closed for Christmas and Sunday (half of our stay), so we didn't get to know the neighborhood that way.

We had never been there before, and we've heard pretty bad stories about staying in the less expensive hotels (room's are a lot smaller than in the pictures, dirty, crappy beds/baths, etc.).... but we gambled on one anyway, since it was all we could afford. : ) Well, it worked out, because now we know exactly where to tell our friends to stay whenever we hear they're planning on going to Rome. I'll just go over some of the important points that made me and my wife feel good about it. - It's a short 5 minute walking distance (with luggage) from the main train station. - We both felt very comfortable about what area it was in. We were thinking that it possibly could've been in a dodgy sort of area... but it was nice! - The hotel is owned and run by a father and son. They both speak very good english. They were both very accommodating (like an owner or staff member should be). STORY: In passing, we had told the person behind the front desk (the father/the owner, which we didn't know at the time) that it was our anniversary. That night, when we came back from sight-seeing all day, there was someone different behind the front desk (the son). We said hello, and he greeted us kindly and said, \"Oh, please wait here for one second.. I must speak with you about something.\" My wife and I were both nervous that something was wrong. He then handed us a bottle of champagne, and said that his father told him that it was our anniversary! It was very, very nice, and unexpected! - The hotel room was perfectly clean, and nicely sized. Nothing to complain about. NOTE: We lucked out and got a street-view room. I have posted pictures of our view, and the room. Try to ask for one of these rooms. - The bathrooms were pretty standard to the other places we stayed while in Europe. Efficient : ) - The staff (father and son, and at late night, some other person) is/was very good at explaining things to us. What to do, where to go, etc. - If you're a newbie to Rome, I'll just let you know that you can walk everywhere you want to go from this hotel, except for the Vatican... the Vatican is just a bit further away. - There is a small market where you can get almost anything you would need to eat or drink for very good prices about 2 minutes from the hotel. My wife bought her bottle of water there for super cheap, and I got various food items and drinks for cheap. It's to the left when you exit the hotel.

It was very hot when we were there (close to 100 degrees) and the air conditioning was not that cold but we found this to be the case throughout Rome. When we had a problem with the a/c (it was blowing warm air) the hotel responded quickly and fixed it before we came back from dinner. The bed was not very comfortable unless you prefer a firm mattress but we were so tired every night from our busy days that it didn't really matter. The room was cleaned daily and the housekeeper did a good job. The bathroom had a tub with a hand held shower, which was annoying because it didn't attach to the wall. We weren't sure if this was how all the rooms were or just ours. Again, not a big deal but it would have been nice if it had a wall attachment. There was no dresser but the closet had two shelves (the safe was in there) for clothes. The TV was on a decent sized desk. There were no English channels - again no big deal because we had so much to see! Our room was right next to the tiny elevator - we only used it once to bring our suitcases up (only one person could fit with two suitcases). Not many people used it since the hotel only has four floors but a few did which would occasionally wake us up if it was very early. The continental breakfast was served daily. There were two types of cereals and an assortment of breads (my husband loved the croissants) along with yogurt. Coffee and juice was also available. You can purchase the Internet at the hotel (1 EURO for one hour, 3 EUROS for 3 hours and 10 EUROS for the whole day). It was pretty slow but worked well enough to check email or look up directions. The hotel staff was very kind and helpful. When we scheduled a trip to Pompeii (you can book directly through the hotel and a shuttle picks you up in the morning to take you to the tour bus) they opened breakfast early for us to eat before we left. The hotel is in a great location. It is very close to the Colosseum (about a 10 minute walk) and Roman Forum and about a 5 minute walk to Termini train station.

It was only 7 minutes from Termini walking distance (DO NOT make a mistake and take a cab from the train station - they WILL rip you off). When we came there, we were greated so friendly by the son of the owners that we felt like we belong here. He was extremely helpful showing things around on the map and even suggested itenarary for the whole stay. The hotel is 2 minutes away from Santa Maria Maggiore, which you can even see out of the window. The hop on, hop off bus stop is right next to this church.

There was NO weird smell in the room, it was clean (I'm a clean freak), and tidy. Air Conditioner was working perfectly, you even have a thermostat in the room.

Rome's historic attractions are within walking distance if you're up for a bit of exercise (the Colosseum is about 15 minutes away). Facilities in the Amalfi are quite basic, though. Nonetheless, by Roman standards, the hotel offers value for money (we paid 78 euros for a double room per night via the minotel.com website). Unlike some other hotels - especially in the historic centre - the Amalfi is not a rip-off and does not pretend to be more than it is. Staff were friendly enough but not always brilliant. The night porter was a grumpy old man who was clearly unhappy about the prospect of us returning after 1am, in which case we would have had to ring the door bell and (presumably) get him out of bed. When checking in, I was reassured that there would be no problem if I came back after 1am... Breakfast was nothing to write home about, but then it rarely is in Roman hotels and I am usually more than happy to forego hotel breakfasts and have a coffee and some fresh bakery things at a local cafe bar. There is a bakery near the Amalfi that does the most amazing coffee. Its croissants, pastries, Italian cookies, etc. are close to perfection. (Leave the hotel, turn right and walk down via Merulana, away from Santa Maria Maggiore, crossing one or two streets until you come to a pedestrianised little street with a bakery at the corner on your left. I think the street is called Largo Leopardini.) To cut a long story short, this hotel is recommendable if you want affordable, down-to-earth accommodation that is neither shabby nor lacks comforts such as your own private bathroom (which was small, but functional) and a TV in your room. Most importantly, the bed was very comfortable.
