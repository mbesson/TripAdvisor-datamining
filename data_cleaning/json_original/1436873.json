As others have mentioned, if you want to be close to the San Marco attractions as well as alot (and I mean ALOT) of stores, the hotel is in a great location. We stayed in a triple room in the main hotel rather than the annex. The room was not huge (about 225-250 square feet) but it was very clean and nicely furnished, with the basic amenities (22\" flat screen TV, mini-bar/fridge). The bathroom was extremely clean - it did have a sliding door with opaque glass on it, so privacy was a bit of an issue. As others have mentioned, getting a reliable wifi signal was an issue - we took our laptops down the hall to the breakfast room in order to get a stronger signal. The breakfast room was small (about 100 square feet with about 4-6 small tables) and the breakfast offerings were the same as we experienced in Rome and Florence (continental breakfast with cappucinos, milk, cereal, juices, yogurt, pastries, Nutella).

Our room was good-sized, had a balcony and it was superb. Renovated with a chandalier to die for with Murano glass features, the apartment was not your usual hotel stay. But being so different, it made the stay just that more memorable. We had to walk the few minutes every morning for breakfast back to San Luca, but this was part of the journey. In fac, getting around the streets of Venice is in itself an adventure. The hotel itself is boutique but everyone seemed to be happy. The breakfast room was quite small, but the food was really good, the selections were ample and the service was good. Coffee was freshly made for you and not limited to a cup of airline quality brewed coffee. Francesca and her team were keen to assist with any enquiries and helped us with a water taxi from our cana address direct to the area adjacent to the seaport for our following cruise.

Remember though that there is virtually no neighborhood life here; it's all commerce and tourism. Anyway. My room was new, very comfortably furnished, clean and modern bathroom. Helpful staff, good breakfast with cold cuts and croissants. Wireless internet was free on the deal I cut. If you get a good price, as I did in January, you will definitely feel that you have lucked out. The hotel is partners of some sort with a nearby restaurant (Trattoria da Gioia I think it's called), and they will recommend that you eat there. Don't. Restaurants in general in the vicinity seem to be largely run by non-Italians and I am wary of what they serve. There is some geniune ambiance across the Rialto bridge, at the open-air veggie and fish market; there is also some nighttime action at some wine bars on that side. The Goldoni cafe, practically around the corner from the hotel, serves wonderful, heavenly coffee.

The hotel was new and appeared to be clean. However, i was fairly surprised and dissatisfied by the welcome I received from the attendant at the front desk. I was travelling to an international conference in northern Italy by myself and my plan was to stay one night in a hotel in the centre of Venice so that I would avail of my time as best I could while in the city. He appeared to laugh in my face when he knew I was travelling alone and then placed me in the room exactly by the reception. I asked to be moved away from here when shown the room as I stated I wanted somewhere quiet but excuses were made saying it was the quietest room in the hotel! I was after taking a very early morning flight to Venice from western europe and an over-night bus prior to my flight. I was unable to go asleep with all the talking and noise from the reception desk which was just outside my room. My laptop also failed to connect to the wireless at the hotel and when I informed the same attendant at the desk and asked him if I could bring it out, he came straight into my room without any courtesy shown or asking for any permission. I felt this was an invasion of my privacy during my stay and noticed him looking around while in my room. Also, in contrast to the information stated by the hotel, all attendents on the reception desk cannot speak english in a competent manner as the nighttime attendant had very little english. In fact, only that I asked the attendant at the desk the following morning, I would have been given incorrect directions when leaving Venice the following day. Furthermore, when I decided to go to see St. Mark's square at midnight, I was instructed in a most unfriendly fashion that the doors were being locked and that I had only 20 minutes to go up and see it and come back again! I would expect much better staff service from a hotel that charge the rates that this hotel charges!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "MEMSouthWales", "ReviewID": "UR66965780", "Content": "The hotel was clean with good bed, sofa and safe.

The only bad point of our actual room and I can't speak for other rooms in the hotel but it was the en-suite. Again it was impeccable, beautifully done in marble and lovely tiles floor, big sink, all you could ask for but it was a wet room. I don't normally have anything against a wet room but the design of this one was all wrong. The shower was in the middle of the room and simply got everything wet! This wasn't helped by the floors not being sloped very well so it didn't soak away very quickly.
