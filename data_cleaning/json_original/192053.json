Despite the trip advices, I decided to book there beacause of the price. Spent there 3 nights. Well I wasted my company money ... At first it was not easy to find the hotel: despite the name on the sign in the street you actually enter the Guildford hotel. The room was a 6 sq meeters burial niche under the roof of the building: it was almost impossible to open the door because of the furnitures ... The bed was a sort of mat whjile sheet and blanket. The bathroom was small. Because of the position and the dimensions the room was particularly hot. I had breakfast in a sort of kithen downstairs where they gaveme some tea and crakers.

I got them to turn the heating off but was so tempted to travel home last night, but decided to have a few drinks and leave early this morning.

Obviously I could not sleep and felt dirty lying in the bed, the blanket and sheets had seen better days, eventually at 0600 I went to reception and stated I wanted to check out as I was supposed to be there two nights, the receptionist asked what was wrong and stated that he could offer me a new room. I came back later the same day and was offered a double room, the mattress was 1000% better, no dip and a proper shower room, however I still unsure if the room was clean but I did stay for the second night to my detriment as I woke up with bites all over my arms, I went to see the doctor who stated they looked like bites, can you imagine!

Having known what it would be like, I would have happily paid masses more to stay anywhere else. On arrival, I was slightly concerned by the fact that the two people in front of me at the reception were complaining and one of the doors in the lobby had been propped open using a carton of gone off milk...I wish I'd have turned and walked out there and then. On stepping up to the reception, the sour-faced member of staff slammed a check in card in front of me without even saying 'hello'. She snatched my credit card off me, took my payment and shoved a key in my hands. On entering the room I was appalled by how grimey it was. It clearly hadn't been cleaned in weeks. The carpets were full of dirt (I'm asthmatic and I left the place with a wheeze due to the dust levels), the glasses and mugs covered in hairs and other peoples toothpaste, spiders on the ceiling, but nothing prepared me for the bathroom... It was covered in congealed dirt, pubic hairs and mould. The shower curtain was so mouldy (and had been tied up with a dirty old plastic bag) that I wouldnt let it even touch me. As the bathroom was so small (the toilet was practically in the shower), you had to step out into the bedroom to dry off - unfortunately this faced a window with no proper curtains that backed onto another persons window which is fine if you're a nudist, if not it wasn't ideal. When we checked in, there had been no mention of breakfast (despite us paying for it) and in the lobby the next morning there was no sign of any activity, Needless to say anyway, we decided that there would be no way we'd eat in such a dump for fear of getting ill, so we headed to the local cafe and paid for breakfast. When we checked out, the woman on reception merely barked at me that 'check out is 11am!!!', to which I replied that I wanted to leave now. She then snatched the keys off me and carried on with her work. Having been all around the world and having stayed in some very very cheap and some pricey accomodation, I have to say that this was without a doubt the WORST hotel experience ever and the WORST value for money. This place should be closed down and if environmental health review it, I guarantee that they will shut it immediately.

As soon as I saw the room my first impulse was to turn around and go find another place to stay, but since I arrived quite late at night that wasn't an option. I really have nothing good to say about the hotel. Here are the facts: - It smells like mildew. You too will smell like a walking fungus by the time you leave. - The room (or should I say broom closet? It doesn't really deserve to be called a room) was in the basement--tiny, dark, damp and right by the noisy street. - I heard every single mouse fart in the neighbourhood. People on the street, snoring somewhere in the hotel, someone going to the bathroom--and it all sounded like it was happening right next to my bed. - Wind and damp came in through the window. There was no heating, so I spent the night wearing tights, socks, a cardigan and a jacket along with my PJs to stave off the cold. - Dirty sheets and towels. I periodically woke up itching all over and--lo and behold--discovered bites on my legs the next day. - The integrated shower/toilet cubicle appears to have once belonged to a caravan. And no prizes for guessing that it was dirty. I can't comment on the breakfast. I got up very early and fled, without bothering to find out how many cockroaches or mouse droppings they served up alongside the sliced bread and processed cheese. If there is a hell it surely is modelled on the Grenville House. Would not wish this on my worst enemy.

I booked it because it was one of the cheapest I could find in a central London location. The room (a double) was freezing--the heat was turned off during certain hours, I was told, because most of the guests are not there during the day. However, it never seemed to get warm, even at night when you'd expect the heat to be turned on. The hot water seemed to be on a timer as well--one day it was warm, the next it was lukewarm at best. When I told the reception about it, the response I received was \"that's impossible.\" The toilet leaked after flushing it, the bathroom had a very unpleasant smell emanating from it, and the television remote control was broken. I can accept these problems to some extent if I'm expecting budget accommodation, but at \u00c2\u00a370 ($140 for me as an American) a night, that's not a budget price.
