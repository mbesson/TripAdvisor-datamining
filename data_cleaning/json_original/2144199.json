I had flat #21 which faced the street. It was a bit noisy at times (sirens, traffic, street noise), but since the building is not on a major street, it was ok. The place was very well appointed, warm and modern and very nice. You could fit a small family here, as there is a couch with pull-out bed, sleek modern kitchen with appliances (fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker). A few notes: there is no open lobby or onsite dining. The front door is locked to the street. You will want to confirm and re-confirm your arrival time though. My experience had me arriving into Barcelona close to 9 PM. When I arrived via cab at Up Suites, the front door was locked and no one answered the call button. Tired and a bit desperate, I called every suite, hoping someone would answer, but no one did. I would have been in real trouble had my colleagues not also been in town and had a phone number for the proprietor (my phone plan does not support international calling). That week was a very busy week for the city, and I doubt I would have found a hotel room, especially at the late hour. Fortunately, the proprietor arrived very quickly after our call and was quite nice. My advice - if you are arriving in the middle of the day, you should be ok, but take note if arriving very early or late as there may be no one to greet you after your journey.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cSpotless, well-equipped apartments\u201d", "Author": "Jenny212", "ReviewID": "UR125229016", "Content": "My partner and I stayed with my parents (in two separate apartments) for 5 nights in February.

Friendliest and most helpful staff anyone could ask for, a washing machine/dryer in the room, spacious bedroom with a moving wall that separates the living room (kids slept on large sofa bed). Neighborhood is fantastic with a Deutsches Bank about 1/2 mile away, a Leonidas chocolate shop, nice bakeries, a candy store, a place for great jamon called Don Ulpiano around the corner. The closest metro is Hospital Clinic, which is about an 8 minute walk away. As others stated it can be quite noisy in rooms facing the street (I didn't put it together until after I arrived that there's a hospital right up the road, and you can hear ambulance sirens at all hours). So the windows in the room could use some better soundproofing. Rooms have a coffee machine (pods on sale for 4,50 euro a bag downstairs), a dishwasher. Lots of kitchen utensils, a small stove with 2 burners, no oven, a microwave, large fridge. An elevator is available. Building is secured by a locked door where you need a code. Strong wi-fi included. Not really negatives, but some things that could be improved upon: safe was available, but it wasn't secured to an immovable object, meaning I (or anybody) could pick up the safe and carry it anywhere. The bed was fine for sleeping, but since it is two twins pushed together, a bit difficult for extracirricular activities. The place is great, but 140 euro a night is a bit steep, but Barcelona is quite a bit more expensive than cities in Germany.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cExcellent - highly recommend\u201d", "Author": "LuvsLierna", "ReviewID": "UR124122773", "Content": "We stayed for six nights in mid January 2012. Everything was excellent. The two gentlemen who manned the reception area could not have been more helpful. The apartment was exactly as advertised and was immaculate. One of the best features was the closet space! It was like being home for six nights - everything unpacked in the wardrobe! Our first room faced the street and we did notice street noise so we did ask to change to a different room. This request was promptly met with no fanfare. The location is in a non-touristy neighborhood. We selected Up Suites for that very reason and were not disappointed. That said, it is about a 15-20 minute walk to Placa Catalunya. However, the red line (Urgell) was about 8-10 minute walk. There are wonderful bakeries nearby as well as a grocery store and several fruit and vegetable markets. For us, Up Suites was the best of both worlds - tour all day and live like a local at night.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cPerfect family lodging\u201d", "Author": "quiotto", "ReviewID": "UR123863926", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights.

Great advantage of staying at Up Suites apartments is that you had a washing machine so we could do all our washing whilst we were there before we continued on our holidays after 3 weeks on tour. We were pleasantly surprised at the room and the amenities we had to our disposal. The washing machine, dishwasher, coffee machine (buy the pods from vending machine downstairs - great coffee by the way) were a bonus, the bedroom, kitchen/dining room and lounge were tastefully decorated and there was even a small balcony which let the natural light through. The street noise was hardly noticeable as the bedroom is behind a partition from the lounge. Atif who checked us in on arrival was fantastic in explaining the location, where everything was ie. metro how to get into the main area, where the local supermarket was, available tours and how to get around. Certainly was very helpful with any of our queries and more than willing to provide any assistance if we needed it. Organised our tickets for the Big bus tour and organised a taxi to take us to the airport. His employers should be proud of the work he does and always with a smile, which makes you feel so welcomed and comfortable to be there. Would thoroughly recommend staying at these apartments and if we go back to Barcelona we would definately stay here again. If you want to see Barcelona in a different way try doing a Segway Tour of Barcelona. We booked this online and we had a ball going all over the port, Barcelonetta and the Olympic area on the Segway instead of via foot. We covered so much ground and had such a fun time. Their web site is www.barcelonasegwaytour.com you will have a ball. Also make sure you visit the food markets just off Las Ramblas called La Bocaderia. You will be amazed and the different foods you will see here. Other sites not to miss are La Pedrera, La Familia Sagrada and Park Guelle and the Monestary at Monteserrat.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki", "Title": "\u201cgreat suites and great location\u201d", "Author": "bepositivebut", "ReviewID": "UR117655947", "Content": "We were 2011/July (family with one kid) in Up Suites Bcn and we liked it a lot.
