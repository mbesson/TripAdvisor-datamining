Basically it ends up as an exercise in managing expectations; and this stay was no different. I needed a hotel close to Paddington. I normally stay at the Hilton above the station but in these straitened times had to trim my budget. Others had mentioned the Paddington Court so, off I go and book through Laterooms for a price of \u00c2\u00a389, room only, including taxes - less than half the price of my normal home from home. I arrived in the early evening and knew this was going to be fun when the receptionist looked thoughtfully at my laterooms confirmation, paused and immediately called for help. My guess is that they had overbooked and the system had not found me. After a few minutes looking guilty, my helper told me \"Don't worry - you have a good room - we have upgraded you - its big. Its over the road - in the basement\". The Best Western has two properties adjacent. The Shaftesbury Hotel holds the reception, restaurant, bar, fitness area, kitchens, all the infrastructure. The three buildings across the road are called the Paddington Court Rooms and are accommodation only. I booked here because the theory is that you get a better room in return for sacrificing the convenience of having the amenities in the same building. My room was in building No 3 - room 652. If you are allocated 651, 652 or 653 you must remember to ask the staff for the climbing ropes and the crampons you will need to abseil down the almost vertical stairs to the underworld where these rooms are to be found. On a slightly more serious note, if your mobility is in any way compromised (new hip? Arthiritis? like me) these stairs can be a real challenge and you could really struggle if you had to manoeuver a suitcase or two at the same time. The hotel does not do itself any favours by leaving an area of the corridor wall 4' square by the bottom of these stairs damp and mouldy with peeled off wallpaper. They really should fix that quickly. That said - the room was adequate - larger than you would expect for this price (about 200 sq ft - no, don't gasp with horror - get over it - this is London) and was scrupulously clean with fresh bedding and excellent towels, which I would say were probably brand new. Now to the brickbats - the shower cubicle was great if you were aged 11 or below. I filled it completely. I could either stand in it while the water ran over me, or I could stand half in and half out while I moved arms and elbows to wash and turn and do my Frank Sinatra impressions. The handbasin was good to hold just that - one hand - and the loo was so close to the wall that you could only sit on it sideways. (That is the case in the newly refurbished rooms at the Hilton in New York as well, so maybe its the fashion these days...) The ethernet cable for wired internet was broken (the retaining lug was missing); there was no wifi in the basement (the hotel advertises free wifi in all rooms); the TV was broken (no pictures and it defeated the efforts of three members of staff to fix it or reboot it) so there was a bit of frustration circulating through my veins when I went out to find a local restaurant for an evening meal and a beer. When I returned the receptionist who checked me in was having a crafty cigarette on the pavement outside the hotel in a quiet moment. He could run but he could not hide, so I tackled him about these challenges. He was extremely pleasant and patient and did his best - but there is a limit to what you can do in his position when faced with a request to remodel a bathroom for a guest for a one night stay, so he offered me a free breakfast instead (a \u00c2\u00a314.95 extra worth about \u00c2\u00a33.99 on a good day). I gratefully accepted. The following morning when I checked out the staff were friendly and helpful and I left thinking that, for all of its faults, the location is just beyond criticism and, for \u00c2\u00a389 a night, it is still a good deal in London when the tourists are heading back to town. I have stayed in worse at double the cost. Will I return? Yes. Despite the challenges, this price range is notoriously difficult in London. if you want to spend \u00c2\u00a3150 the choice is much better - but for less than \u00c2\u00a3100 a night, this seems to me to be about as good as it gets.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire, England", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst I have stayed in!

This proved easier than it would seem, because the hotel we were staying at - the Allandale - had been taken over by the Best Western across the street, and was being renovated. Dust was everywhere, the smell was appalling and the second room was little more than a broom cupboard. Breakfast, we thought, would make things better - the famous full English breakfast. Now, we'd paid for it, but every morning the breakfast room staff ( none of whom seemed to speak English. Okay in Prague or Paris, NOT OK in London!) would try to stop us from eating, claiming we 'hadn't paid'.

Because during my stay, there was a change of management. The Allandale was bought by Best Western. I learned about this when I came - loaded with christmas shopping - back to the hotel one afternoon and workers were removing the \"Allandale\" signs at the doors. My nice room \"Italy\" was suddenly number 611 and there was a note on my bed, that the Allandale now belongs to the Best Western chain. They also changed the very nice duvet to a simple woolen blanket (Best Western standard!). After a horrible night (I was so cold under the thin blanket I even got the towels from the bathroom to wrap me up in) I went for breakfast in the Best Western Hotel opposite the street as I was supposed to do according to the note on my bed. It was a very different experience form the nice breakfasts at the Allandale Hotel I have had the days before. It was busy and chaotic. I waited ages for my tea (it really took me 20 minutes to get the attention of a staff member to order some tea - and then again 10 minutes to get some milk). The buffet was out of plates so people put there toasts in bowls. Also the qualtity of the food was very low. I mean: Yes, the breakfast selection at the Allandale was limited, but the eggs were fresh and cooked to your order and the jam tasted lovely. At the best western the eggs tasted dry and old (having been standing on the buffet for hours probpably) and the jam was very artifical. I very much liked the atmosphere at the Allandale breakfast (linen table cloth, lovely decoration etc.) - at the Best Western everything was just cheap and hectic. It is very sad, but under the new management of the Best Western Paddington Court the Allandale will become a part of a chain hotel with no indivdual charm at all. And I have only seen the first signs of it! At check-out (now at the Paddington Court hotel opposite the street) they ask for my room number and when I said \"Italy\" they looked at me like I just landed on the moon. And then they wanted to charged me a night to much. No problem here , mistakes happen - we sorted that out after a few minutes. But the way I was treated was not very polite or friendly.
