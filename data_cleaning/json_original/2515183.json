I love the fact that you check in at the bar! It is a charming place in the 5th on a quiet square and a stone's throw from Notre Dame. In the summertime, the restaurant has tables outside and it can be a nice spot for an aperitif or dinner though the cuisine - simple plats - are underwhelming. There are probably less than 10 rooms (6?) and each is decorated uniquely - some more elaborate than others. My favorite has been the large room on the 2nd floor. My least favorite has been on the top floor. The rooms could use a makeover as they are looking a bit worn. With no elevator, the staircase is steep and winding but the hotel staff will assist you with your luggage. We always love the breakfast which consists of croissants, pain, beurre, confiture, yaort and fresh squeezed jus d'orange. You can enjoy it in the restaurant until 10 am or have it delivered to your room. For many years when making reservations we went through Nicole who we got to know over time though she was not there the last time we went.

There was no internet in that building, and the only place where the WiFi signal was decent was the restaurant.

Rm 501 is fantastic and should be the first pick for any couples. I would avoid Rm 10 at all costs. This room is very tiny and noisy in the evening and early from kitchen noise. There were also ants in the bathroom. I didn't see them in any other rooms though. Noise- it's a bit noisy at night from traffic along the Seine. This seems to be more prevalent on the upper floors. Pillows- this may be minor to some but the pillows are terrible. Again, this varies by room. Stairs- not an issue for me but anyone who has trouble climbing stairs will not be able to stay here.

On previous trips we stayed in the 7th so this was a new area for us. The hotel is great. We loved the age of the building, the winding stairway with its worn timbers, and decorations. We had the recommended room 24 which we really enjoyed. The only thing I wish it had was more lights. It was dim and romantic, but not very good for reading or trying to get organized for the next day at the really cool old table. The hotel has that worn but not run down feel that we really like. The bathroom was up to date, spotless, with plenty of water pressure. The staff was excellent. Our french is very basic, so we relied on a lovely young woman, Maria (?), quite a bit. Her english was much better than she thought it was and she was very helpful. One evening we were wanting to go to a play and did not know how to reserve the tickets. She took our information and made the reservations, paid for the tickets and everything. All of the staff was helpful, and patient with our french. The nice lady who serves breakfast was very efficient, and I got to practice my french since she spoke no english. The breakfast was good and it was included in the room. I especially enjoyed the fresh orange juice and breads. Being right in the middle of things was a new experience for us. It was a little noisier and crowded of course, but was a fair tradeoff for being steps away from the river and all the action. You can have an \"Anne Hathaway moment\" across from the hotel as a scene from The Devil Wears Prada was filmed there. It is on a short little street that dispite being maybe 50 steps from the main street along the Seine, seemed like you were out of the bustle of tourists and traffic.

Upon arriving there it was even better than I was expecting! It was set in such a beautiful area, with lovely narrow sidestreets and shops and restaurants close by. We each had 2 pieces of luggage and once we saw the logistics of getting that luggage up to our room...we were a bit worried. But, not to worry! Nicole, the kind woman who runs the hotel quickly offered that we could leave our bags with her in the restaurant/bar area. When one of her workers came back in a bit she gladly had him deliver the bags to our room. We were thrilled! At the end of our trip he brought them down for us as well. Now, you may be wondering why so difficult to get the bags to our room? Well...this place has no elevator and our room was on the top floor. The way to get there is to walk up 5 flights of narrow, winding wooden stairs. Just walking up there with our smaller bags gave us a good workout. Which was just perfect for us! At the end of every day, even though were exhausted from walking all over Paris we were glad for that extra climb because then we didn't feel so bad about eating all the food that we love! :) The room we stayed in was #47 and is up on the 5th floor (?) The room felt very comfortable and charming and I loved the fact that I didn't feel like I was in some hotel chain room. When I came \"home\" to Les Degres every day I knew where I was. I was in Paris. I was in a unique 10 room hotel. It just was great to stay in such an authentic Parisian-feeling place! Our room had 2 twin beds which were comfy. A TV set which we never turned on. A fan, which we did use because the warm August nights warranted it. A nice desk. The bathroom had a twin sink which was nice, but the one less-than-ideal thing about the bathroom was the shower that was entirely enclosed in glass. We each kind of value our privacy...so when someone was in the shower, that was it. The bathroom was then taken! We worked around it, but that little detail definitely caused us to have to work out our morning showering routine. The bathroom did have a hair-dryer which was wonderful. Overall, the room was very clean and an inviting place to be. One of the highlights of staying in this room was the incredible view! Oh. My. Word. So, every night I went to bed with one of the towers of Notre Dame as my nightlight! Incredible...I could see the tower from my bed. What a lovely memory to have, falling asleep looking at that! It made me smile every single night. And a really funny aside is that the towers do not stay lit all night. At 1:00 am every night the lights go out. And they don't go out all at once. They go out switch by switch by switch. This was fun to watch and just picture someone inside doing this every night. We slept every night with the windows wide open and didn't find noise to be a problem at all. In the morning at Les Degres there was a fabulous breakfast (included in the price of the room) that was ready the minute we sat down. Just perfect to start the day. A plate of baguette pieces, croissants, jam & butter, 2 kinds of cheeses, tea, coffee & freshly squeezed orange juice. And I do mean fresh...they run the oranges through the machine right there in front of you and then serve it up. Heaven!! And the coffee is absolutely wonderful. Nicole makes a nice pitcher of strong, delicious coffee and then serves it with a smaller pitcher of steamed, lightly frothed milk. I really really miss starting my days with her fabulous coffee. And I am a very picky person when it comes to coffee. My son had his own small pot of tea every morning. The location of Les Degres is great. Right next to the Seine...wonderful for strolling. It's so close to the St Michel Metro stop and is an easy walk to the Louvre, Musee d' Orsay, Sainte Chapelle and of course Notre Dame. And the Latin Quarter is just a great, great, great location. I cannot say enough about it. There were many times that my son & I commented to each other how grateful we were to be staying in that area. So charming, interesting, busy, fun and close by to lots of things. When we needed any advice Nicole was so helpful and she spoke impeccable English, which was so kind. I do not know much French and it was nice to be able to communicate. She was very nice and even booked a cab for us on our return back to the airport. The cab driver she uses is great too. I don't know his name, but he was very attentive & prompt. He loved telling us everything he knew about Paris on our drive back to the airport! If I ever get to visit Paris again I will most definitely stay at Les Degres de Notre Dame.

The hotel is 15 minutes walk across the river to the Louvre. The breakfast at the hotel is great - freshly squeezed orange juice, yoghurt, croissant, bread, cheese, jam, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and served by a very pleasant young man. You can also have your evening meal at the Hotel's restaurant although we didn't do this but probably would have done if we had been staying longer.

I booked it after reading all of the more recent reviews (I booked in January or February of this year) and felt there were most positive than negative ones. What I wanted was a small hotel in a typical Parisien area, so we decided to concentrate on the 5th. My boyfriend was also hoping for a place with decent-sized rooms because we knew hotel rooms in Paris would be smaller than American standards. The one thing that no one can dispute is the amazing location of this hotel! It's literally about a block and a half south of Notre-Dame Cathedral. We would use the Cathedral as a signpost to know how to get back to the hotel. The street itself was quiet though there's a very busy area of bars and restaurants only a few blocks away and occasionally people would walk through that street after leaving the bars and would be talking loudly. We booked room 36, so not the biggest room (I believe that would be the one on the 5th floor) but it was definitely large enough for our needs. We were staying 6 nights and brought enough clothes for the changable weather, but I must be used to living out of a suitcase because the lack of dressers didn't phase me. I used the closet to hang a few things but the rest stayed in the luggage, or on the floor, to be honest. The bathroom was a bit oddly laid out but spacious. It had a large bathtub and shower (great water pressure, too!) with sliding glass doors. There were two sinks and ample counter room for our toiletries. The bathroom had its own windows so you could get rid of the steam easily. We had asked for a queen/king bed and did discover that it was two twin beds put together, but I actually didn't notice this for a number of nights! The bed seemed fine to me and I slept very well. I did realize that there was no clock in the room, which is rather strange, but I had my cell phone set to local time and we used the alarm function on that to wake up in time for breakfast. I don't know if the room next to ours (there were only two rooms on that floor) was empty during the first few days of our stay, but even after we were sure that some people were staying there, we didn't hear a peep out of them. My boyfriend had asked that I find a place that had breakfast included, which was another reason we went with Les Degres, and we weren't disappointed. True, it's not the biggest breakfast, but it was fine for both of us. It included fresh-squeezed OJ, coffee or tea, one croissant per person, jam, butter, and a whole (medium-sized) baguette. I stuck with the croissant which left all the bread for my boyfriend, but we were satisfied with the meal. I was surprised to find there there isn't any lobby to speak of, and that if you needed to talk to someone you had to go into the dining area or kitchen. I found the staff to be helpful and nice, especially Nicole and Cecile when I was emailing to make the arrangements. I speak French so that's how I interacted with the staff. Twice I needed to ask for something (forgotten bathroom cups and the iron) and they were able to take care of it quickly. We were on the third floor and there is no elevator, so my boyfriend was grumbling a bit each time we went up to the room, but we're both healthy enough not to have a serious problem with it. If my parents had been staying there, however, I think they would have been unhappy. All in all, we were happy with our experience there.

Since this site was such a huge help to me, i wanted to give back with a 100% honest review of Les Degres Hotel. PROS: -LOCATION:)--After walking what seemed like every square inch of Paris, you simply can not beat this location. Situated on a quiet street in the 5th, it is right around the corner from Notre Dame, 1 block from the Seine and 3 or 4 blocks from the Metro. Perfection! It was exactly how i pictured Paris. -Breakfast was included. If you're one of those people who needs a gigantic breakfast, you may want to look elsewhere, but if you want a light fare of croissant, bread, coffee and juice, it was nice to have a free meal every morning. And the orange juice was fantastic! -Price was totally affordable. 110 Euro a night for a \"double.\" -Room--We stayed in room 11 and it was about what I expected for Paris/European standards. Remember kids, this is NOT the 4 Seasons. It's a tiny boutique hotel. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was clean. The bathroom was a decent size and had incredible water pressure. And the view was lovely. -Booking was easy. I did everything through email and the staff got back to me immediately. In English. -Nicole and Cecile, the 2 women who run the hotel were very friendly and spoke perfect English. They made us feel very welcome. Now for the Cons: -There is no lobby whatsoever in this hotel, therefore no front desk or concierge. The women who run the hotel are there til 5 pm but after that, you're on your own. Since it was our first visit to Paris we could have used a little guidance and maybe help making reservations, etc. -There is no clock in the room. You can arrange a wake up call but it's not guaranteed to come. We almost missed our car on the last day because of this. Bring a battery operated alarm clock. -There are no dressers in the room, only a teeny closet, a desk and 2 nightstands. 2 women traveling in one of the most fashionable cities in the world with no dresser? You can imagine what the room looked like. -I asked for 2 single beds when making the reservation. We walked in to find 2 single beds that were pushed together and sharing the same headboard. It's a good thing my friend and I are close:) If you're traveling with someone you don't want to share a bed with, I recommend getting separate rooms. -There is no elevator in the hotel and no ground floor. Even the first floor requires stair climbing. It was fine for us but could be problematic for some. -Only a few staff members spoke English. I speak French, my friend did not, so she struggled a bit when i wasn't there. -We only made about 5 local calls yet our phone bill was 40 Euro??? If we would have known that we would have used a calling card for everything and not just long distance. -Skip the restaurant downstairs for all meals except for breakfast. It was pricey and just ok. 4 Euro for a Coke?? Is this standard? -No internet connection so don't bring a laptop. I'd recommend using the internet cafe around the corner if you absolutely need to use a computer. All in all we had a very lovely time at the hotel and I would certainly go back, because of the location more than anything. There is a fantastic restaurant on the same street called Le Reminet as well as anything else you could possibly want. I hope this review covered all territory.

We had seen several reviews in the paper, read the ones posted here and we anxiously awaited our visit. We booked the \"suite\" on the top floor, a little more expensive but not overly, well worth the price! The stairs gave us the opportunity to work off a little of the extra eating, the wonderful croissants at breakfast, and the chocolates we could'nt resist. The stairs are narrow and steep, you just need to take your time. The staff are very friendly, accomodating, and speak very passable English. The location is the best! Off the busy streets but very convenient to Metro, Ave St.Germaine, and best of all the Ile Cite. We were able to walk everywhere or take the Metro. The hotel is \"rustic\" but very well maintained. On subsequent trips this would be our one and only choice. The other rooms we could see were very well appointed and we would certainly take one of them if the top floor room was not available. Please say hello to Nicolloe, Shannon, and Cecile - the very friendly staff - they were excellent, helpful, and there when you needed them! If you like cats they have the most friendly one I have ever seen - Tom, he rules the hotel!

The hotel was recommended to us by friends - I did not have the time to look it up so we just booked it. I think we were quite lucky that there was an available room - booked it less than a month before we went. It is a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. Opposite the Norte Dame, although not so obvious from the exterior, the rooms were pure luxury. Our room, to be precise, was large, with a wooden floor and ceiling. The shower-room had not long been renovated. There is no lift available, and although the long spiral stairway is a bit of a task to complete, it is well worth it. The reception staff were extremely attentive and looked after us thoughout our stay. We were late arriving and although the kitchen had closed, the welcoming reception staff arranged for us to have a meal at the hotel. Breakfast was also lovely - traditional parisian croissants with semi-freshly squeezed orange juice, hot drinks etc (but not buffet). You also get the option of breakfast being served in your room. Upon departure, they also stored our luggage until late in the afternoon when we headed off to the airport. My only complain is the price. While there, we were informed that the prices were going up for 2006 - I personally found the price we paid average. Not cheap but not extortionate.

This did not seem right to me. I explained to the staff member that it's unfair. The following day, Nicole, emailed me a long message to say that because the hotel is so small they only reserve long stays (5-7 days) and for regular guests first. They book short stays (e.g. 2 nights) sometimes but not always on weekends. Her words are \"At the moment we are taking long stays just till the end of 2005. We are taking short stays only till october if they are not for week-ends, or if the stays are after, or before another long one.\" So don't even bother to request a 2 night stay at this hotel unless you can rearrange your plans to suit the hotel's strict and unfair reservation policy.
