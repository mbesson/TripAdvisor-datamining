{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great for Florence Stayed at Hotel Cavaliere in October 2007. Charming little hotel in the traditional style. Accommodation is basic but adequate - after all, you don't go to Florence to laze by a pool!It is situated very close to the River Arno so bring mosquito cream; it is a good 40 minutes walk from the historic centre [not what the hotel's web site says!] but a number 23 bus will take you right into the pedestrianised area around the famous Duomo. Bus stop is about 100m away by the pasticceria [not the first stop you come to, walking with your back to the river]; tickets from the bar nearby.The bedroom and shower room were adequately sized and traditionally furnished, which meant a very tall wardrobe. Each room has its own laptop with cheap but slow internet access. The tiny breakfast room had only 4 tables and a mini-buffet serving the standard cold continental breakfast, but there were more tables available in the reception/coffee bar area.For those coming by car there is public parking in the square in front of the hotel, except on the one night of the week when the street sweeper calls in the early hours - read the signs carefully!", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR743537718", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sunshiner"}, {"Content": "Not recommended Don't believe the claims that this is a 3-star Hotel. It is barely a two star with a well appointed bathroom (although there are ceiling panels missing and soap scum on theshower glass). In a country renowned for its love of food there are very few restaurants within walking distance but there are plenty of motor cycle and car workshops if that's your thing!! The location is apalling for anyone relying on walking (and believe me, I have happily walked many kilometres in other lcations). Que sera - we can't always be lucky with sites booked off the net.On a positive note the one and only staff member I encountered on checkin (and all evening) was very helpful.", "Date": "Oct 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR444693163", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "SWFAus"}, {"Content": "old-fashioned value       the beast", "Date": "Aug 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR663295302", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Tristans_friend"}, {"Content": "Good value We had no complaints about this hotel. Our room was at the back on the 2nd floor and there was a small lift so no stairs to worry about. Room was spacious and the bathroom was well appointed. Everything was extremely clean. The bed was comfortable and the room very, very quiet. There is free internet access if you are carrying your own laptop. Not the most convenient location for walking but once we figured out the bus service it was not a problem. The breakfast was the usual basic Italian fare which was adequate. For a 3 star hotel and considering the price we paid on a last minute deal website, we were rapt. Would recommend as very good value for money.", "Date": "Jul 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR955860655", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Buona la posizione dell'hotel...   showReview(22305991, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR754938992", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottimo hotel familiare   showReview(18909816, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR877777332", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "marioRoma"}, {"Content": "Carino!   showReview(17286215, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR397909199", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Kirschex"}, {"Content": "Qualit\u813f prezzo ottimo, \u732b stato...   showReview(11385891, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR951240429", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "El hotem esta muy bien situado...   showReview(11385892, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR719536612", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Excelente opcion para firenze...   showReview(11385893, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR919280745", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'h\u4e48tel est assez difficile \u813f...   showReview(11385894, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR290031513", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Queda algo alejado del centro y...   showReview(11385895, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR889926206", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Qualit\u8305 globale moyenne pour un...   showReview(11385896, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR220278822", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Il mio soggiorno presso questa...   showReview(11385897, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR746932722", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d574744-r11096148-Hotel_Cavaliere-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "574744", "Price": "$111"}}
