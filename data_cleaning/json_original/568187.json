Yes, it's a bit dingy and the cleaning of the room is not very thorough. Yes, the breakfast is kind of like two muffins rapped in plastic and a peace of cardboard. And yes, it's noisy when you wake up ind the morning from voices from outside and inside the hotel. But you get a great little espresso in the morning, the \"muffins\" is actually great to bring on your trip around the city and your bed has been made when you return in the evening. And that's what you pay for. You don't want to chill out in the hotel room for a day - no - but if you're in Rome, why would you?", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot a god place to stay !\u201d", "Author": "Curt_Olsson", "ReviewID": "UR115704337", "Content": "It is quiet the only positive i can say about this hotel and central.", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNo smoke detectors - sleep with one eye open\u201d", "Author": "Holidaylover56_11", "ReviewID": "UR115352408", "Content": "Booked through Travel Republic for one week 10 - 17 July 2011 for bed and breakfast at the Farini Hotel Rome. Had to come back after two days as could not sleep for worrying. Hotel advertises 24 reception and if that had been the case we could have stayed but in truth we were given 3 keys to let ourselves in because hotel reception was left unattended at night. Two fire extinguishers were in clear view on premises but with no one to raise the alarm I felt very unsafe. I checked reviews before I went and knew to expect a 2 star and a bit shabby but that was not a problem for us. The lady receptionist does not have good english and when I asked about fire alarm all she did was point at extinguisher. Also no safety deposit safe and no telephone.

Whatever I was promised was not there. When got to the (around 9:00 PM) Hotel there were nobody from the Hotel Management. A tenant from the building gave me the key. The space was only to fit a bed. I hardly could put my lugage. A/C, TV was not working. I managed to call the Hotel owner. She proposed me to provide me an alternate room the next day. I left the Hotel as it was just impossible to stay there for the first night. Hotel charged me for the first night. I requested budgetplace.com for a refund for both the charges. Hotel denied as I didn't cancelled it 24 hrs before arrival.

The location is a tourist-trap (not surprising, since it's located near the central station) and has a bunch of overpriced stores. It's also apparently not safe to walk around in the area at night: lots of drug-dealing, prostitution etc., our local friends tell us. The hotel room was tiny and dark. we stayed in a double room and the bed filled the entire space, leaving hardly any walking room. The bathtub didn't even have a shower curtain. \"Breakfast\" was served in the room (again with hardly any place to keep the tray) and consisted of pre-packaged pastries, juice, and bad coffee.

Hotel Farini was fantastic - the room was huge and we looked right out onto the tram stop and down the end of the road was the termini rail station. There were dozens and dozens of restaurants and shops within walking distance in every direction. The shoe shop two buildings down is definitely worth a visit. There is a supermarket around the corner - turn left out the front of the hotel and then turn right. There is a laundromat round the other corner - turn right outside the hotel. There is a beautiful church just across and down the road and a tour company which we did tours of Rome and Pompeii with. Very handy - especially for the tours leaving at the crack of dawn!! We found the hotel to be so full of character - we loved it and the kids thought it was sensational!! It is a little bit different from the usual hotels you might be used to but this was what we really loved about it. We also felt totally safe as it was right next door to the police station! This hotel is the real rome and not totally touristy and conventional.

We were on a budget, but didn't want to stay in hostels. We stayed in three different 2 star hotels, but Hotel Farini was by far the worst. Since we were going in the summer and Rome can be terribly uncomfortable, I kept insisting on a place with A/C. We found Hotel Farini on-line and it advertised A/C and a smoke free location. First thing we see is the manager smoking and when we get to the room it is disgustingly hot. We ask how to turn on the A/C and are told it will be an EXTRA 10 euro PER night. Then we were told we have to pay 1 euro to use the phone in the room, even for toll-free numbers. In addition, there is no shower curtain and the rooms are so small that a double bed takes up more than 75% of the room space. They call themselves a 2-star hotel, but when you get there they have 1 star on the door ringer. I wouldn't even give them a 1/2 star.
