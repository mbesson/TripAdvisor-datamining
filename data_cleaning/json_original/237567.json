The elevator was a treat, especially for the one sore knee on the trip. We both felt safe and secure. Our email contact before our arrival for directions was timely and clear.

Was soo happy with my choice here...once again scored points on this one (I do all the hotel booking). We arrived after a long flight from Perth. It was around 7am in Amsterdam and dark and cold. On the way to the hotel to drop our luggage i was thinking, goodness what are we going to do to entertain ourselves for the hours before our room was ready! Roel welcomed us with a smile and then proceeded to tell us \"that we were in luck our room was ready\". This was heaven to the ears. What I loved was that Roel was expecting us, new who we were and our situation (long flight). That felt so nice compared to bigger hotels! Hotel Fita was a family run hotel and is a tradtional style Amsterdam house. This however added to the charm for us Aussies as was a world away from how we live. Elevator available if you need. Hotel Fita consisted of around 15 rooms..we stayed in 2 of them (as we returned on two occassions). Rooms were perfect, clean, bright and comfortable!!! Bathrooms were excellent (heaps of room) and the best shower of our whole trip in Europe. Nespresso in the room (yay), no fridge however. The only instance I think you would need a fridge if you were travelling with a young baby or something and I know Roel/Martjin would assist if required (bottles etc). Breakfast is served daily downstairs and was lovely. Continental Breakkie and in addition they will make you eggs/bacon or dutch pancakes. There is a fridge downstairs with drinks, which was handy as sometimes you really didnt want to venture out just to get drinks. It works on the honesty system, you pay for what you consume!. Location - Hotel Fita is in a great place. Best shopping district (high end street) very close by. The canal tours leave just down the street and some of the best museums 2-5 minutes away!

I have, at last, found my favourite hotel in this charming city. The Hotel Fita is located on a quiet pedestrian street within a stone's throw of the Van Gough and Rijksmuseum, and in the other direction, close to one of the city's exclusive shopping streets (perfect for window-shopping). The Concertgebouw is no more than 6 mins' walk; the stunning Vondelpark is within a 2-min walk, and Bus-197 stops very close by--so you can get to/from Schiphol in 15 minutes for 4 euros. Within 10 minutes of my arrival, the owner Roel had done the following: arranged for me to rent a bike (good idea); booked dinners are nearby restaurants (they were excellent and inexpensive); handed me an annotated map; had my speedy wifi working (no extra charge). Was I happy? Delighted. What's unique about this hotel? First, this building is a typical charming canal-house that is _not_ typically cramped and awkward. There is a lift (if you're not keen on steep stairs), and the energetic family who owns the hotel has not spared any expense to ensure everything works, everything is spotlessly clean, and that the guests' needs are paramount. Second, the rooms (I have stayed in two and seen three) are bright, newly-refurbished, and have Nespresso machines at our disposal. The showers are hot and powerful. The beds are new and the sheets are probably Egyptian cotton. The breakfast is excellent (eggs and pancakes in addition to cold options); the \"honesty bar\" is open 24hrs and has whatever cold drinks you can think of--for just 2 euros each. Yes, a glass of wine for 2 euros. Where else would you find that in Amsterdam? There is a large grocery store nearby. I should add that there are two primary schools nearby too--but that only adds to the neighbourhood atmosphere: it's nice to step outside and see kids running around. The street feels more like the Upper-West side in Manhattan than the stereotypical cold polish of an exclusive European quartier. I will be back, and next time I'll bring my kids. That's another bonus: Roel says that he charges just a nominal extra kids' beds in their parents' rooms--this will add up to a big savings. In my experience most European hotels require a full second room at a full second price. What a great stay.

Each of the staff we met over our 4 night stay were all as charming and friendly as Martijn and couldn't have been more helfpul. And the breakfasts were amazing too! Not only a delicious buffet and freshly prepared hot bacon and scrambled eggs each morning but the option of freshly made pancakes which my husband said were delicious! My comment about 'not for light sleepers' is not a criticism of the hotel though. The hotel is very centrally located and we stayed over New Year so predictably, people were letting off fireworks all New Year's Eve Day and Night - I am sure if we'd stayed at a different time of year, we wouldn't have noticed the noise. Finally, I have to praise the staff for their reaction to something unfortunate that happened during our stay. Despite being a 'no smoking' hotel, the people in the room next to ours decided to smoke the absolutely disgusting smelling 'skunk' and the smell filtered through to our room. We went and spoke to one of the hotel staff who immediately went and reprimanded the other guests who despite pathetically denying they were smoking, ceased and then the room was thankfully ventilated and sprayed with air-freshener.

It was a wonderful vacation - but, I do have to say that arriving at the hotel with 3 heavy bags in hand at 11:00 in the morning and looking at the steep entry stairs made me think, \"uh oh\"! Fortunately, there was a lift just large enough for our 3 bags - which was great because our room was on the third floor! We were greeted by Queenie, who was very kind and patient with us - we were a bit jet lagged (and grumpy), but she made us feel welcome and got us into our rooms right away. If you asked our daughters, they would say the best thing about the hotel was the breakfast, in particular, the dutch pancakes. They were terrific! Breakfast was the same every day: scrambled eggs (fluffy and light), bacon (salty and delicious), yogurt, granola, dried fruit, baked goods, cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, toast. But, there was enough variety that you had the opportunity to try everything. The rooms were nice and clean. A regular room with a comfortable bed. If you're looking for a posh, five star room - you should find another hotel. Hotel Fita is comfortable and clean. All you really need since you won't be staying in the room for long periods of time. There's so much to see and do in Amsterdam - you really just want to come back to a room that is inviting and comfortable. Free internet was fantastic and so valuable when looking for a good restaurant or checking the train schedules. But, for me - the best thing was the free laundry service! We didn't need to bring 3 bags of luggage! Laundry was sent out in the a.m. and when we returned in the evening, our clean laundry was waiting for us! Roel and Martijn were such wonderful hosts! And, so young! They spent time with each guest, asking how they could help, what we all needed - such great hoteliers! Location: IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER! The tram (#2 and 5) are right outside your door (all right, it's around the corner!), the Diamond Museum, Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum are all within close walking distance. If you like shopping, the \"Rodeo Drive\" of Amsterdam is a block over from the hotel - nice for window shopping after a heavy meal. There is a supermarket (Albert Heijn) close by for wine and cheese. And, there are several nice restaurants within walking distance. Roel and Martijn are happy to make reservations for you or make suggestions for restaurants in other areas of the city. We know that when we return to Amsterdam, our base will be the Hotel Fita.

They recently sold the hotel to another family, but the things that people seemed to like about the de Rappers have been maintained by the new owners, and particularly the two brothers Roel and Martin who seem to deal most with the guests (including the delicious pancakes at breakfast).

I was so disappointed that our visit was going to be a few days after Keukenhof Gardens closed for the season; I decided to try and do something about it. I first needed to see if I could change our Hotel reservations to arrive earlier. Roel answered my request within a few hours telling me that it wouldn't be a problem and that the garden would be worth a visit even on the last day. (The gardens were wonderful.) We arrived in Schipol and took Bus 197 from the airport to the Leidseplein stop (Just asked the driver to let us know when to disembark) we were just a few blocks from the hotel. While we purchased our bus tickets for the trip into Amsterdam from the driver, we had stopped at the tourist information shop at the airport and purchased our tickets to Keukenhof and a 72hour GVB pass. This saved both time and money. When we arrived at Hotel Fita, Roel greeted us and checked us in. He provided a map of Amsterdam and went over all the major areas, sites and transportation. Very basic information yet all we needed to get started. He showed us to our room downstairs...at first I wasn't sure about the location but we loved our cozy room away from everything. This did put us right next to the playground for the daycare center, yes the children where outside. Did we hear them YES they are very young children and they can get loud, we could hear them laughing, giggling, running, playing. Did it in anyway disturb us NO. Our room and the bathroom were spotless including our resident guest \"Rubber Ducky.\" The standards for the maintenance and up keep of this hotel are the top priority for the new owners. We did speak with Martijn during our visit; he told us they have plans for improvement in the future. They would like to add additional rooms to the top floor of the hotel and a possible new full service restaurant downstairs. While we only saw other guest during breakfast, everyone had a nice rapport and it did seem that the guest were welcomed friends. Like many first time travelers when we started our journey we assumed this would be a once in a lifetime trip, after visiting so many wonderful places you find they have a way of calling you back\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.so I have now started planning a new trip, first stop Amsterdam and Hotel Fita hope to be visiting next spring, early enough to see the tulip fields in bloom.

Room #10 is located adjacent to the front desk, which I will admit made me fear the noise of every hotel guest's arrival, but we did not hear a peep due to an extra door that separated our room from the activity. The room itself was larger than we expected and sparkling clean. I appreciated the clean, sparse decor as it makes it easier to pack up and not miss a thing upon departure. #10 has a large window that presents a lovely view of the street and the school across the way. Though other travelers reporting on this site found the school to be noisy, we were not bothered by the children playing during their recess hour. The school is active only during the day and, of course, never on the weekends. We are accustomed to a king bed at home, but did not have much of a problem with the two twins pushed together, which seems to be very common in European accommodations.The bathroom was also large with a shower steaming great water pressure and long, comfortable tub for relaxing after a lengthy plane ride or for tired muscles after a day of touring; all white tiles and squeaky clean, blow dryer included. The street outside is well traveled during the day with walkers and cyclists, and the parking near the hotel is limited and expensive$ We had rented a car, so Ruul referred us to a parking structure nearby that was much less expensive with easy access.

If you are looking to stay on a budget for a few nights and get a single room with a good rate then don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to book this place. The Good: Excellent location, in the Museum district next to Rijksmuseum and Vang Gogh Museum. Hotel street is quiet at night. The street in lined with trees and is pleasant to stroll on. The main high end shops are located nearby. So is Vondelpark which was a big plus for me personally as it is nice to go walk in the park or have drink in the afternoon. I booked a forward facing double room with balcony which was really spacious. The balcony made it extra special as in the summer it would let nice breeze flow through the room. Free internet and free international calls. Room was cleaned daily. People who worked at the hotel were real friendly and had many suggestions on what to do in Amsterdam or even outside of the city. Good breakfast with to-order pancakes that were delicious. One block away from tram stops with two lines that could take you right to city center in ten minutes. The Bad: Cleanliness was an issue for the single room that I had to take for one night. That room is located on the reception floor at the end of the hallway. I found lots of long strands of hair on the chair and bed and stains on the desk. That single room was really small and is suitable for a short stay on a budget. Another thing about cleanliness is the cleaning detergent they use which has strong acidic sell to it. I always had to close the bathroom door whenever I was in the room. The entire hotel smelled like bacon every morning as the cooking smells from the kitchen came into the rooms. This was a problem for me and it might be for others. There was not much closet space in the room. Housekeeping knocked on your door as early as 8:30 am to ask if they can clean the room. There is not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDo not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign to hang outside your door.

I have been going to Amsterdam for the last 30 years! The hotel is easy to find, just take tram #5 or #2 from Central Station and get off at museumplein, or the stop after. Bus #197 from Schiphol stops at museumplein as well. Upon arrival at the hotel I was greeted by Hans, the owner. I was shown to my room; I used the elevator/lift as I have back problems, so the stairs would have been a problem for me. My room, a single with a balcony on the first floor was great, en-suite, nice and warm, Nespresso coffee maker, kettle if you want to have hot chocolate or tea. The bed was very comfortable, nice warm duvet, and the heating was on all night at a nice temperature. (It was December) The breakfast is, as like everyone has said on here, delicious! I opted for freshly squeezed orange juice and then scrambled eggs on toast, with bacon. A pot of coffee, as well as a pancake after. You have to taste the pancakes to believe them! The hotel Fita is very clean, and I mean VERY clean! If you find any dust or dirt, tell them at breakfast and by the time you get back from a day out, it will have gone! Something I must add is, I booked to stay there until 22nd December, Hans and his wife had arranged to go away for Xmas, they had to cancel 2 days of their trip so I could stay for 6 nights! How many hotel owners would do that? As this is an honest review, I must tell the good with the bad! There are no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs to be put on the door, if you are out late like I was one night until 5am, housekeeping tried to get into my room. I had to get out of bed and say no! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sleeping! (I have emailed Hans about this and he said he will implement the do not disturb signs) My 2 friends who I persuaded to stay at the hotel also had the same problem! That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, nothing bad, really! I have read reviews where they say the host, Hans is rude! He is not, he is a genuine guy! He likes to brighten up your day; some people take that the wrong way. He loves to have a laugh and a joke, my friends and I still laugh about something he said at breakfast one morning. Roel takes over from Hans when he is away; he makes better pancakes than Hans, and better scrambled eggs on toast! Thank you Roel!

The room was large, based on other European rooms we have stayed in, clean, and very comfortable. The bathroom was good size, although no real toiletries were provided, but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem we just popped into a drug store and got some shampoo/conditioner and some lotion. The shower was powerful and there was a hair dryer provided. The location was great, just behind the Van Gough Museum. We had a little trouble finding it initially, but that was our own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tired head, jet lagged - fault. We did take the bus from the airport (BTW, we asked at the airport where to purchase the strippencard, and were told they were no longer used, so we just paid cash to the driver), which we found after a little bit of searching in the bus lane outside the airport. We walked everywhere, only used the tram once or twice. The Tram was really convenient, once we did decide to use it, but we like to walk and take in the general atmosphere. There is a Tram Stop just behind the hotel. We had great weather, but I suspect had there been rain we would have used the tram a lot more. Breakfast was great! We were the only ones in there two of the three mornings. We had eggs and bacon each morning, along with sweet rolls, fresh orange/strawberry juice, and of course the famous pancake. There is a school that seemed to be right next door and across the street. This didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really cause a problem for us, as the kids were outside playing after 9 or so, when we were already up, but if you like afternoon naps, you may in for a bit of a letdown.

One reviewer said it may not be the place for you if you want \"bells & whistles\"; indeed I would argue that you might miss some of the standard hotel features. First off, yes, this is a wonderfully personal hotel and you definitely feel at home with the owners. Hans is a wisecracking guy with a big booming voice and is a delight. HIs wife and the rest of the family/staff are also quite friendly and happy to do what they can to make you happy. They serve up quite a breakfast every day as well. I am a light eater so I didn't partake, but they will apparently cook you eggs and pancakes to order and they also give you a fresh glass of pressed orange juice. I also liked the location in the Museumplein. Close to what you want and not what you don't, if you don't. And they do your laundry for you for free, same day! Wow. At the same time, a few things took away from the experience. For me, one thing was that there isn't anyone stationed at the front desk. You have a key to the hotel to come and go as you wish, but the problem is that unlike other hotels, even small boutique ones, you have no one there to whom to say \"hey, do you know x, y or z?\" Like if you want quick directions to something or want to request something for your room. You can reach them by calling on the phone from your room, but it's kind of a pain to have to go back inside and make a phone call instead of having someone there. Also, my room was a little too utilitarian for my taste. I don't mind a small room at all (see my review for base2stay) but it's not as nice if the furnishings/design are not especially cozy. The bathroom too was a little institutional with wall mounted soap push dispensers and disposable packaged washcloths. My room was also too chilly for me, as it's heated by radiators like you would find in your apartment. I'm used to being able to crank the heat if I'm cold in a hotel.

Just up the street, there's a tram station that delivers you to many locations throughout the city. Amsterdam is a great city to explore by walking. What we liked most about the hotel's location: we were less than a 10 minute walk to the beginning of the city's canal rings, yet returned each evening to the quiet, comfortable accommodations of our hotel, away from the tourist hustle and bustle. Breakfast was served in a lovely room and provided a great start to the day. You'll enjoy fresh coffee, fruit, cheeses, eggs, sausage, yogurt and the most delicious pancakes, while chatting with other hotel guests and swapping restaurant and sightseeing suggestions. For a fun, entertaining evening out, dine at Pasta E Basta. The food is delicious, and you'll be treated to servers who, as students at a local music school, take the microphone and perform songs in between serving the patrons. You get a great meal and great entertainment all in one place! We recommend taking a canal cruise, too, as you'll see parts of the city that you wouldn't necessarily see by foot.

We placed our clothes in the laundry basket gave them to Hans, and when we stopped back after lunch the clothes were in the room. The breakfast was very enjoyable. We ate in a comfortable room, were served coffee or tea, fresh squeezed juice and pancakes every morning. The buffet included eggs, meat, cheese, fresh fruit, breads, Hans' homemade jam, granola, yogurt and cereal. During breakfast Hans was always available to answer questions, give advice or just chat.

Planes were grounded across Europe and no one knew when the eruption was going to end and when we could get back home.

My family and I stayed at the hotel for a couple of days prior to embarking on a bike and barge trip. We had been in Holland for a week prior and really needed to do some laundry before getting on the boat. The desk clerk advised us that they had a \"free\" laundry service and all we had to do was put our clothes in the basket and leave it at the laundry area in the morning. She stated that the laundry would be done while we were out touring the town and would be in our room upon our return at the end of the day. We were overjoyed that we would be free to tour around and not have to spend our time in a laundromat. We arrive home to find a basket full of clothes that had all been dyed purple!!! When I called the desk to ask what happened, the owner was insistent that it was our fault for not separating the laundry. I assured him that had we been told to separate it, we surely would have. As well, if it needed to be separated, why did they go ahead and throw it all in together - it was obvious that there were brightly coloured items as well as whites. So why didn't they return the dirty laundry to our room and advise us that it needed to be separated before they could wash it. Many of the items were not salvageable and we had to throw them away. I estimate that we lost at least $150 worth of clothing. I felt strongly that the hotel should take responsibility for the loss and asked the owner if he would consider giving us a reduction on the room rate so that we could purchase replacements for the remainder of our trip. He flat out refused to take any responsiblity for the screw up and pretty much told me that I shouldn't complain because the same thing could have happened at a laundromat. I was furious that he wouldn't even consider a rate reduction - in my opinion it's the LEAST he could have done since it was a member of his staff that screwed up by not telling us to separate the laundry. I eventually walked away from his berating and arrogant attitude and told him my Trip Advisor review would reflect exactly how poor his customer service is. So - no good review from me. Trust me - there are plenty of other places in the same area that are well priced and you won't have to put up with an arrogant and rude owner who doesn't think it's his responsibiity to make a situation right when one of his staff screws up", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery over rated...expensive rooms and very tired decor but in good location\u201d", "Author": "tembokubwa", "ReviewID": "UR40364547", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel on the basis of the very positive write up in Trip Advisor...and were very disappointed.

And the other TripAdvisor members have, for the first time, let me down. I observe that many of the positive reviews are from North Americans who, maybe, are seduced by the small-world charm and are unaware of how appalling the value is. Firstly, this is nothing more than an old-style UK \"Guest House\" or Bed & Breakfast as a previous reviewer said. It is clean, friendly (ish - see below), but the rooms just have that old guest-house feel to them... (and I'm not anti-guest house... the operative word is \"old\"). The rooms were distinctly average, even within the category of a guest house. There was a nice nexpresso coffee machine, but with NOWHERE to plug it in (I found a plug in the wardrobe - good job I hadn't hung up any clothes). Clean but basic. Breakfast was fine. The pancake was a pancake (crepe)... and with all that icing sugar it could have tasted like any other crepe... I don't see what the fuss is about. Yes, breakfast was fine, but hardly anything special. Service. Well... the staff who checked us in and at breakfast were just perfect and welcoming. But I'm not really sure about the owners. Everyone says they are helpful, but they didn't seem that interested in me... especially the \"wife.\" I think she enjoys talking to her North American guests and being praised for being quaint... but a distinct snobbishness. And as for the \"husband\" - he didn't seem at all interested in introducing himself. The location is Wonderful. But that's it. And for the price of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150, certainly NOT worth it at ALL. I would happily pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75 and give it four stars... (but only as a guest-house). So, if you're expecting a \"Trip Advisor\" wonderful gem... trust me... you will be disappointed.

The facilities were excellent and the location was perfect. But what was exceptional was the helpfulness and friendliness of the owners and staff. We found that they took an active interest every morning and afternoon, in what their guests planned to do that day and how it worked out. They suggested additional activities and ways to save both time and money. They told us about bus #197 which took us with our luggage from the stop 3 blocks away directly to Schiphol airport for only 3 Euros each! Parking for only 6 Euros/day that included 2-way tram tickets for all passengers in the car! (Our first hotel in Amsterdam had offered parking for 25 Euros a day.) On Sunday when we worried that many shops were closed, the owners suggested renting bikes to pedal the canals, since it was much easier with fewer commuters. The Fita is located one block from the Van Gogh museum, with great tram and bus connections, and easy walks to the parts of Amsterdam you most want to see. When I visited Amsterdam 35 years ago, the action was at Dam Square, and the only draw for the south side was a day at the museums. But Dam Square is no longer the center of interest in Amsterdam. You need only one day for Jordaan and the Anne Frank house. The shops, restaurants, canals, and people watching are far more interesting around Museumplein, Munttor, and Leidesplein. We had the least expensive room, and it was located at street level, but there was no noise as pedestrians were few, and there was no truck or car traffic on these small streets in a quiet residential neighborhood. And it was the largest room with the largest bathroom for our whole trip. When you have to repack for the flight home, it is nice to have enough space. On the 24 day trip we stayed at seven 2 and 3 star hotels. Three had tiny rooms, three were noisy, two were seedy, two had careless housekeeping, and most had staff that was barely communicative. At the Fita, not only was the room and hotel exceptionally clean, but the owners take special pride in assuring that it is kept clean and in perfect order. We discovered that the owners once worked for a Sheraton hotel, and opened this hotel some 13 years ago almost as a hobby. They had found the big hotels were too impersonal and they wanted to provide similar top level accommodations but with some personal connections with their guests. Breakfast was top quality with fresh fruit, pancakes, bacon and eggs, and the usual European cereal, cheese, bread, and pastry. They gave us suggestions for local restaurants beyond the typical touristy steak and fries menu. And many extras like free laundry, phone and internet service, a discount for seniors, a welcome drink, an elevator, shampoo and extra towels, alarm clock, prepurchase museum tickets, etc, etc. These made this hotel worth the small difference we paid over the other hotels on this trip. Next trip I will gladly pay the 20 Euros more, and make it up with the savings in parking and bus fees, better food and peace of mind that we got from this very pleasant hotel with its owners and staff that truly want to make your visit hassle free and memorable.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest, Romania", "Title": "\u201cLittle quiet & relaxing place\u201d", "Author": "Dana2000", "ReviewID": "UR38116630", "Content": "We had a lovely time, the hotel's location is excellent - close to the center of the town, in a very quiet area.

Otherwise the location is very good near Van Gough Museum and Leidseplein. The owner of the hotel was quite nice but his wife was kind of moody. One time we had rented bikes we went back to the hotel to ask them for the name of the street where the 7 bridges were located but the owner's wife kept on talking to a couple even though she knew I was there waiting for their conversation to end and when finally she seemed to have ended her conversation and I asked her if she could tell me where the ..... she interrupted me and told me with an angry face that I had to wait for my turn because she had not finished talking to the couple yet. The next day she could not even face me.

There is a free computer with internet access and a printer - great for printing out your boarding pass before heading to the airport. There is also free wireless available in the rooms.

The husband and wife team that run this hotel seem like nice people, but try to complain, and they go on the attack, and they are vicious and relentless. Be warned. I expect to be harassed because I am posting this review. The following is a true account of what happened to me. After kicking us out two days in a row to clean our room, the maid had yet to remove the dirty glassware or clean the room properly. The mirror in the bathroom had tooth flossing specks on it, not from us. There was mildew on the grout in the bathtub. The glass topped coffee table had grease on both sides of the glass and the rug and not been vacuumed. The windows on the french doors were dirty on both sides--these windows were easily accessible, and oddly, the other windows in the window seat area, which were harder to get at, were clean. The room was actually very nice, one of the best in the hotel. And with 10 minutes and some windex and bleach, all would have been fine. However, when I tried to explain this to Hans, one of the owners of the hotel, he went ballistic. I was not aware that complaining was not permitted in their hotel. While we were alone in my room, this intimidating man became irate. He yelled at me for being too demanding! I told him maybe he was unaware that the maid wasn't taking care of all the details when cleaning even though she made such a point of kicking us out of our room for her to clean it. The first day we were there. We were so jet lagged we went back to bed and were fast asleep when the maid walked in on us! We had put the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door, but she said it had fallen on the floor. She didn't even knock! She insisted that she had to clean the room immediately and gave us 10 minutes to dress and get out. We were too groggy to stand up for ourselves, or to complain about such treatment. The next day, my husband had left to work at the trade show but I was still in the room when she came in and wanted to clean it. So I grabbed my stuff and got out. When I got back I noticed she made the bed and changed the towels. I went downstairs to get some ice and since the ice bucket that had been in our room was not clean, I went into the kitchen and washed it in the sink with some dish soap. I was approached by one of the other employees who asked what I was doing. I told her that the ice bucket had not been clean and I wanted to wash it before putting ice in it. I told her things in our room were not as clean as I would have hoped they would be. A few minutes later, Hans came up with windex and bleach. He said something about that he had told the maid to bleach the mildew in the tub, and he went in to do that. I took the windex and started to do the bathroom mirror and he went ballistic. I pointed out the toothpaste spray on the mirror and said that it had been there since we arrived, and suggested that he might have a problem with his maid not doing her job properly. And we didn't appreciate her walking in on us or kicking us out of our room when we had obviously been asleep! Hans started shouting at me about how unreasonably picky I was being and that everything can't be perfect in a room. He then ran his hand over the top of the armoire and it came down covered with dust! I had no idea what his point was, I wasn't even complaining about the dust, but it was comic how he was raging defensively about how clean the room was and it was actually even dirtier than I had noticed. About a half hour later I was having trouble using the wireless internet, so I went downstairs to try the set-up they have for the guests that don't have laptops, and I saw some windex and a towel next to the computer. So I borrowed these items and took the opportunity to clean the stuff that had been bothering me. I replaced the items when I was done. I sent an email to Loes, who was my initial contact when I booked my stay. She is the wife of Hans and from what I can tell, a co-owner. I told her \"This is not acceptable behavior. I would like someone to apologize to me in a civil manner and I expect polite treatment and good service for the remainder of my stay.\" Then she called to shout at me and tell me how happy she is with all of her staff. And since I did not like my room, I could move out immediately! Now she was being spiteful. With the one of the biggest trade shows of the year in town, there was no way I was going to be able to find anything, and I was not the one that was unable to control my temper. I told her I would see what I could do. And I told her that since I had had a chance to clean the room, it was satisfactory. But that only made her angrier. She came to my door and pounded on it! I told her I was not going to open the door or participate in a shouting match. I told her if she could find a comparable room at another hotel, I would move. She tried, but couldn't come up with anything. So I was stuck wondering everytime I went out whether my stuff was safe in a place where they were so rude and wanted to get me out so badly. And worrying every time I came in that I would see Hans or Loes and they would yell at me again. They got to save some money, because we did not go down to breakfast. We ate out rather than risk any confrontation. That's okay. Hans rules over the breakfast room and our first morning we must have come down later than he wished, even though it was still within the allotted breakfast time. So there was no fresh squeezed orange juice for us! I went online to trip advisor and sorted by one star reviews. I found multiple complaints about them bullying their customers! Guess I should have done more research... To prevent more confrontations, I sent her an email telling her that since she and Hans could not seem to control their tempers, that the only way I would communicate with them was by email. And that they both owed me an apology. There was no apology, and though we had scheduled more days after the trade show, we got out of there as soon as we could. One more little annoyance. We paid extra to get the largest room size because it featured a double bed that was a real double bed, not two singles stuck together. But the bed was topped by two small (probably single size) duvet-like things instead of one that fit the bed. The overlap was pretty small, so In the middle of the night, they would slip around on the bed and create a gap right where we were trying to sleep together. They topped it with a thin chenille bedspread that was the right size, so things looked okay on the surface. It's a shame. It is a nice hotel with a lot of great perks. But the inability of the management to control their negative emotions makes it intolerable. Amsterdam has lots of wonderful places to stay.

Seeking a smaller, local option, I sought out advice from tripadvisor. Hotel Fita was consistently ranked highly, and it's conveniently located near the major museums that my wife would be exploring while I attended the conference. So we made arrangement directly with the hotel at a price that was less than the discounted \"official\" hotels that were offered as part of the conference I was attending. Overall, we had a great stay. The owners and staff are fun, gregarious, enjoyable to talk to about any topic, and go to great lengths to make your stay pleasant. The personal touch really adds to the overall experience at this hotel. The rooms are small (welcome to Europe!), but very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is generally very quiet, although the local school kids make some noise during their recesses (the school is located right around the corner of Hotel Fita)! My feeling, though, was that it was much quieter than other hotels located near the center of Amsterdam. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of central Amsterdam, yet still be conveniently located close enough to the action, this is a great option. A warning...the stairs are very steep in the hotel, but there is a small lift to accommodate those who don't want to brave the steps to the upper floors. Breakfasts are fantastic and included as part of the hotel cost. The eggs, fruit, and fresh squeezed orange juice were a great way to start each day. The location was perfect if you are a museum lover. The Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum are literally right around the corner. I think we got slightly discounted tickets from the front desk. It's about a brisk 20-25 minute walk to central Amsterdam from the hotel. Many convenient streetcar options are available within a block or two of the hotel, so walking isn't necessary. There are many local food options located within a 10 minute radius of the hotel. My personal favorite restaurant was La Falote. Just take a left out of the hotel, then a left on the first main road...keep walking for about 10 minutes. It's on the right side of the road (ask for directions at the front desk!). We arrived at this restaurant very early for dinner and were one of the only customers there. The chef came out and insisted on making me a special fish dish that wasn't on the menu. It was fabulous...my wife had one of the daily specials and loved it as well. I highly recommend this place. (It was packed by the time we left...so get there early for good seats and potentially great, personalized service!). There is a local supermarket located around the corner from the hotel...it's located underground, so you may walk right past it!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located in the Museum District, and you can walk to either the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum in less than 5 minutes. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as centrally located as some might prefer, but we had no problem walking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or bicycling (fun!) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c into the most central part of the city, up to Centraal station, and back again. And the beautiful, peaceful, tree-covered streets with quaint canals made me appreciate that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t entirely in the thick of things. The hotel room itself was very pleasant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plenty large enough; we never felt like we were tripping over our luggage. The bathroom was *huge* and spotlessly clean. Just outside our door was a computer terminal with internet that any of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guests could use for free, and down the hall, was the breakfast room. The breakfasts were quite nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not terribly large or varied but still very good and much-appreciated, and the best part was the fresh-squeezed orange juice that the owner made for each guest. All of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers were extremely nice and eager to help in any way they could. Upon check-in, the front desk worker showed us the room and offered her assistance with anything we needed, then left, only to return several minutes later with 2 glasses of sparkling wine and a bowl of nuts to snack on. So, so very nice and thoughtful! The free laundry service was another perk. We just told someone we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to take advantage of that offer, expecting they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tell us where to find the washer and dryer so we could wash our clothes, but instead, they told us to leave our clothes in a bag outside our door and they would be returned to us later that day, clean. We felt a bit badly, because we had about a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of laundry that needed to be done (we were in the middle of a month-long European vacation), but it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be helped, and after all, we *had* chosen to stay there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in part \u00e2\u20ac\u201c specifically because of the laundry service. Oh, and I almost forgot one of the biggest perks: free phone calls to anywhere in the world! We loved having the chance to speak with our families, to let them know everything was going okay. So, in short: the free phone calls, free internet, and free laundry service were what made us pick Hotel Fita to begin with, but the location and friendliness of the staff, as well as the general comfort of the room/bathroom, were what pushed it onto our Extremely Highly Recommended list! Before coming to Amsterdam, I hadn't expected to fall in love with it. I was *excited* about our other destinations (London, Paris, Rome, Venice, Loire Valley) but just couldn't get 'pumped up' about Amsterdam. How wrong I was! I fell in complete and total love with this small, beautiful, and most of all friendly city, even preferring it over every other destination but my first-and-always love, Paris.

In our opinion it is very overrated and what we got was not what we expected based on the information on the site. We booked this hotel for 4 nights because of the reviews, hoping for something special and what we encountered was not at all what we expected. We booked the double deluxe room based on the image on the website - only to be told when we arrived that not all the deluxe rooms have a veranda, they are only deluxe because of size. The onwer couldn`t move us to one with a veranda, and admitted that the image on the website had led to this sort of problem before, and said he was going to change it.. One month later, the image remains the same. We were also diappointed with the bed. From the images, the other rooms clearly have two singles made up together, but the deluxe one looks like a double bed - but our room had 2 single beds made up separately and pushed togerther. Not what you expect at 160 euros a night! We think that the veranda and bed issue should have been clarified with us in the email communications before we finalised the booking. We certainly would not have booked the deluxe room if we had known. Lesson learnt: confirm every detail before finalising a booking - don't rely on the information/images on the website. One other thing, both my wife and I found the beds terrible for our backs - we both found them uncomfortable and left us with back pains in the morning. As soon as we went on to the next city and different accomodation these back problems went away. Apart from the very friendly girl who gave us a lot of information when we arrived , it was not easy to get advice about museums, trips etc, as reception was always empty and you had to speak to the owner on the telephone - but he seemed a little impatient and we found we got better help from the internet. It was useful having access to a computer on the internet, and also one other good thing was that local calls from thehotel room were free. We returned to Amsterdam a week later for 2 nights before flying back to Brazil and this time stayed 2 nights in Hotel Ibis and a much cheaper rate, and had a lovely double bed, which was good for our backs, and we wished we had stayed the other nights there.

However, when we walked into our Double Medium room at Hotel Fita we were pleasantly surprised. It was a very nice size with a big bathroom and even a small balcony. Our room was spotlessly clean and included tea and coffee making facilities. We did not receive a welcome drink as stated in other reviews, but the breakfast was very good. The morning we were there they were serving some sort of meatballs and beans for breakfast which I thought was odd at first, but they were delicious! The staff was very friendly and Hans, the owner, is funny and entertaining. They are also very helpful when it comes to directions or suggestions for dining. They sell Van Gogh Museum tickets at 20% off the regular price right at the hotel. An added bonus is that they will hold your luggage for you after you check out if you are not leaving town right away.

Never having visited Amsterdam, I did a lot of research before making the reservation. Hotel Fita's location was absolutely perfect for us: a half block from the Van Gogh museum, two blocks from the Rijksmuseum, and the next street parallel is full of fabulous high-end shopping, sprinkled with traditional souvenir shops, where we found everything we needed to bring home to friends and family. The hotel is also a short stroll to the Leidsplein where the real action begins! When you've had enough, wander back to Jan Luykenstraat where all is peaceful and quiet. Another reason we chose this hotel was for the included breakfast. A wonderful selection of scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, healthy cereals, fruit and yogurt and of course, fabulous coffee to get you going for the day. During breakfast the owner and his devoted staff of really nice girls will answer any questions about the area as well as offer tips on places you might not otherwise hear about. When he found out we were planning a trip to The Hague, Hans turned us on to the Panorama Mesdag, a fascinating 360 mural of the local beachscape. Another morning one of his employees hopped on the internet to help us find our way to the local castle, Muidenslot. My husband had been working in the Netherlands the week before I joined him and was in need of fresh laundry. How convenient to have free laundry service! Face it, the rooms are traditional European style. You are not going to find jacuzzis and hot tubs in historic buildings such as Hotel Fita's. If that's what you want, stay in the suburbs. But Hotel Fita is in a great location, offers wonderful customer service, and provides a quiet, comfortable and secure place to stay. Combine that with free laundry, free internet and international phone service (my husband didn't belive me!) and a fabulous free breakfast, and you have a terrific little hotel.

My single room was very well arranged. Even though it was relatively small, as almost all single rooms in European hotels are, it felt bigger than average because of the efficient arrangement of the furniture. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, the staff were friendly, the location of the hotel was convenient, and the breakfast was outstanding. I had just come from Norway and Sweden, where breakfasts look quite lavish -- long tables of all kinds of food. Breakfast at the Fita did not have that lavish look but tasted much better: freshly squeezed orange juice, apples, bananas, cereal, canned fruit with yogurt, perfectly cooked bacon and scrambled eggs, excellent pastries and other breads, good coffee. (Tea was also available.) I had only two negative experiences: (1) dragging a heavy suitcase up the steep front steps wasn't fun (but would be the same in any of the small hotels in the heart of Amsterdam), and (2) spending about two hours doing very arcane stuff to my computer in order for it to connect to the Fita's wireless network was also not fun. I enjoy experimenting with computers but not when I have limited time in a city I want to explore. I've used my computer in many, many, many hotels in various parts of the world and have never encountered this kind of problem before. Somebody less inclined than I am to experiment with strange screens buried in the bowels of the computer's software would not have had the promised connectivity. I finally succeeded -- but the Hotel Fita is now permanently implanted in my computer's guts -- I may never be able to get rid of it. I am confident that if I showed up in that vicinity a year from now and turned on my laptop, I would connect with the Fita's network. It was not a matter of the usual login screen with a password that would work for a certain period of time. It was a major engineering feat that struck me as probably hacking into the network. But once I did succeed in connecting, the connection was very good. I'm writing too much about the computer experience simply because I found it so strange. The main point of this review is to say that in most ways the Fita was perfect.

No doubt it is a great location: quiet, in a residential area and with easy access to the tram. The room we had was very basic , clean and large enough. Our room was classified as a double deluxe but are not sure about the deluxe. The two twin beds pushed together to form a double were very tiny and the side tables, attached to the headboard were right against the bed, leaving little room for error. On one side, the table is quite high and we had to place a pillow against its edge so that if you turned over and hit it, you would not injure your head or arm. The owners are lovely people, and very friendly. If you dealt directly with them you got great service. Our bathroom did not have soap in the dispenser, the iron and the kettle did not work or perhaps it was the electrical plugs (hard to tell). Although we mentioned it to the girl on desk, these were never attended to so we used our own soap and did without an iron or kettle. We had been told that there was an iron on another floor but having to look for it was not worth it and the deluxe room is meant to have an iron in it - part of the deluxe feature, I believe. There is little flexibility here. Although we requested a certain type of room, we did not get it. This is quite understandable as it is a small hotel and very busy. However, the girl at the desk did indicate she would add a note and move us if something came available. One right next door came available later but we were not moved even though the people who took it only stayed one night. They could have put them in our room and given us our request for the last night. I guess it was too much trouble. The breakfast was very good but perhaps not for more than two days as it is always the same. Hot foods were scrambled eggs (very good) and bacon. Then breads, cold cereal, yogurt and fruit salad. It ended at 9:30 and toward the end, things like croissants were gone so best get there early enough. The coffee was great, (freshly brewed) as was the orange juice. The atmosphere was pleasant and very friendly. I think we were spoiled by large buffet breakfasts with amazing selections that were included at our previous hotel which was about 35Euros less than Fita. The connexxion which was recommended to us by the hotel must of had some off days as it took forever for us to get to the hotel from the airport. They got us a taxi van because the conexxion was so late. The driver took forever to get himself organized, did not seem to recognize hotel names, needed addresses to the hotels from his passengers and had to use a map to locate the hotels. Some of the passengers had been waited over an hour and this added confusion took its toll . On the return trip Conexxion was late picking us up. Although it was only about 20 - 25 minutes late, thoughts that it could be an hour made us quite anxious about getting to the airport on time. I would recommend a taxi if you have a few people as the conexxion rate is per person or the tram would be a better option. On the whole we enjoyed our stay and the owners are wonderful people - kind and friendly and we feel badly having to mention some of these points but it is important for readers to know what to expect. This is what tripadvisor is about. Keep in mind that even at these prices (160 Euro a night) this is a budget hotel. If that is what you expect, this is a great choice for you. But if you are looking for a bit more then perhaps looking further would be a good idea. I think the rooms here are all quite different and therefore the experience might be as well. The best part of it was the owners. If this is important to you, then you will love this place. We were more interested in getting out and about and then having a nice place to relax after a day of activity and having a breakfast that would be enough to carry us through a busy day. I guess, it is true, different strokes for different folks.

The breakfast was great: eggs, bacon, cereal, orange juice, coffee, cheese, pastries, bread. The included laundry service and international phone calls are definitely a plus. Hotel Fita may look a bit \"outside\" the city if you're looking on a map of Amsterdam but it is only a 5-10 minute walk (completely safe) to the Leidsplein, where things go on all the time. Plus, both the Van Gogh Museum and Reijksmuseum and Vondelpark are probably a 2-5 minute walk from the hotel. One thing I wasn't aware of, though: there is no air conditioner in the room, but that's typical of European hotels and made no difference in our stay or comfort level. Also, the room we stayed in had a ceiling fan, which was nice. The bed and sheets were clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and everything worked fine--plenty of hot water and in-room facilities. Hair dryer, wireless net access, etc. Nice flat screen TV as well. One thing to note, in the interest of full disclosure (I didn't see this mentioned in other reviews): there is a school or daycare on the same block and kids run around a lot during the day (we left on a Monday morning and this was the only day we saw/heard this). Probably not an issue for tourists but if you planned to sleep late during your stay it might affect you. Just putting it out there... Take the Connexxion shuttle from Schipol -- we were dropped off second from the airport (maybe a 10-15 minute ride). The Hotel Fita staff gladly reserves your trip back in advance for you. No need for a cab. Another thing I didn't see mentioned is that there is a long street a block away from Hotel Fita that contains a lot of high-end shops, restaurants, cafes, etc. Plenty to see and do in the nice, secure, and quiet neighborhood around the hotel. This is definitely a plus, especially when you consider how crazy things get in the Leidsplein and Central Station areas in the evenings. it was nice to be in the \"craziness\" during the day and be a very short walk away to nearly total quiet at the Hotel Fita.

My husband and I do quite a bit of traveling for business and pleasure and we never hesitate to rely on trip advisor's reviews. The reviews are usually accurate about the hotels we have stayed in. At the time we made our reservation at the Fita Hotel it was listed as #5 on trip advisor for hotels in Amsterdam. Unfortunately after spending four nights at the Fita, we don't share the high esteem this hotel has received. The best thing about the Fita hotel is the location. The hotel is in the museum district and one block away from the \"ritziest\" shopping street in Amsterdam. It is a quiet, convenient and safe neighborhood. Upon arriving at the Fita Hotel we were greeted by Roel, one of the workers who was very friendly and showed us our room. During the rest of our stay, we did not see anyone at the front desk, it was always deserted. It would have been nice at times to see someone at the front desk to ask some simple questions. In fact, we needed walking directions to a local restaurant to meet a friend and my husband called the number on the in-room information card. The man who answered the phone acted like he was being disturbed at 7:00pm. When my husband said to him, \"How are you doing?\" He replied, \"I'm tired\". Not very friendly. The only time you did see any staff was at breakfast. The breakfast was adequate. Fresh squeezed orange juice, eggs, bacon, cheeses , rolls, and yogurt with fruit. Breakfast is served until 10:00am on weekends and until 9:30am on weekdays. Since we arrived on a Saturday evening all we were told by Roel breakfast was from 8:00-10:00, so on Monday morning we showed up at 9:45am and was greeted \"Sorry, you missed breakfast\". We explained we were not told it ended at 9:30am on the weekdays, and they \"Sorry\" and we left without breakfast. The worst part about the Fita hotel was the cleanliness of the room while we were staying there. Our garbage was not emptied everyday. Along with the garbage can was broken and we told them about it and it was not fixed or replace. The worst was our soiled bed linens were not changed for three straight days. This was inexcusable & shameful and should be an embarrassement to the hotel. Overall at 140 euros a night the Fita hotel was a total disappointment. I guess you are paying for the location because you are certainly not paying for the friendliness, the food and definitely not the cleanliness of the hotel.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheap, fast and no fuss.

We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait at all ~ plenty of shuttles available. And on our return, no fuss in the AM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 24 hours prior to departure, ask the Fita staff to call to reserve your spot back to Schiphol. And so about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Hans and his wife were on holiday for most of our stay in Amsterdam. This was unfortunate because, as we found out on our last night there, he is a wealth of knowledge and a generally fun person to chat with. The employee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that were there for our stay did a great job in their absence. Breakfast was served each morning from 8-9:30 and was delicious. Fresh squeezed orange juice, individual pots of coffee for each table, scrambled eggs, bacon, meats, cheeses, pastries, cold cereal, yogurt, fruit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..we left each morning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fueled up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the day. Our room was a double medium and was comfortable in size. Our beds were two twins pushed together which worked very well for my husband and I who are both over six feet tall. The room was large enough for a little table and two chairs. The bathroom was huge and had a great full powered hairdryer, dispensers for cups and soap, large tub/shower combo and nice size sink counter area. We really liked the soap and cup dispensers ~ nothing worse than those itty bitty bars of soap that slip and slide their way onto the floor and no worry that the glassware has leftover lipstick or baked on crusty stuff. The room also had an electric pot to make almost instant boiling water for espresso, hot chocolate and other choices for in room hot drinks. And clean, clean, clean. I was most impressed with how impeccably clean the place is. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a totally non-smoking facility which is quite nice. For non-smokers, there is no worry of smoke seeping in from other rooms or hallways and no nicotine residue on the walls, linens or woodwork. The free internet and long distance was a really nice and comforting touch. The Hotel is located in a quaint little neighborhood that is away from the bustling nightlife. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best of both worlds really because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a short walk or tram ride to Leidseplein or Spui for loads of activity. And you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be closer to the museums and concert hall (Concertgebouw). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read a couple negative posts regarding the steepness of the stairs. Yes, the stairs are steep, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Amsterdam!! This Hotel (which Hans has completely renovated) was built in 1902 and steep stairs are typical for any structure in this city of this age. The Hotel has an elevator to take you to upper floors if the stairs pose a problem. We learned to be careful managing all staircases while touring the city. I took photos of the hotel to post here but they didn't turn out. I have taken another look at Fita's website and feel that all of their pictures are very representative of the accomodations. Check it out if you haven't already. Be sure to look at the schedule for the Concertgebouw and get tickets in advance (Fita will arrange) for any concerts you might want to attend. They have free lunch time concerts (30 minutes in length) on Wednesdays. Get there on the early side as they fill up. We bought the annual museum card (available at any museum) and found it to be a good value since we visited both the Rijks and Van Gogh three times. Do your research in advance and check out the other museums on the card \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we would recommend Het Rembrandthuis, Museum van Loon, Museum Willet-Holthuysen and Museum Amsterlkring. You must take a quick tour through the red light district \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is where Museum Amsterlking is located. And while there, check out Oude Kerk (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old Church\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) Anne Frank Huis is not on included on the annual museum card but worth the little they charge. Hotel Fita gives a discount coupon for a canal ride which we enjoyed. Go around dusk so that you can enjoy the city from the water while there is still a little daylight but also as the buildings and bridges light up. And although it may sound hokey, do the Heineken Experience. It was a blast!! Page down on the reviews here and look at the post for the special hand sign which will get you a free long neck to enjoy at the end. So, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re planning a trip to Amsterdam, look no further for accommodations > Hotel Fita is the best value for your money and we consider it our Amsterdam \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home away from home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd!", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "Leki", "ReviewID": "UR6163121", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in October.

He made no attempt to help our situation, leaving us to find alternative accommodation for the following day; this meant enquiring at other hotels in the area that evening to arrange something more suitable for the remainder of our stay. Thankfully, we were successful and left the following morning, checking into a very high standard, professional hotel. On leaving Hotel Fita, we were subject to a very abrupt and cold experience and were glad to leave. The propietors of Hotel Fita need to revisit their website to amend their description of the accommodation offered, as we found it to be very misleading as to what the standard of this 'hotel' actually is, or, upgrade their rooms to meet their advertisment. Overall, I certainly would not recommend this 'hotel'.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pickering, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood choice!\u201d", "Author": "apples372", "ReviewID": "UR5358166", "Content": "My husband and I were delighted with our stay at Hotel Fita.

The hotel was conveniently located, being very close to the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum. It was a nice area, a street up from some fancy shops (Chanel, Gucci, etc). The short walk into the centre of Amsterdam was pleasant, so no use of public transport was needed. Our room, number 12, was of reasonable size and was comfortable and functional. It did lack character, and the bathroom could be seen as a little clinical, but at least it was all kept very clean. The double bed consisted of two singles pushed together, which whilst expected is always a little disappointing. Still, they were comfortable with plenty of pillows, which most other hotels lack. The ceiling fan was a welcome addition. Breakfast was poor. The scrambled eggs were in need of some scrambling, forming a huge omelette in their dish. The pastries were plain-tasting, and cereal lacked crunch. Milk clotted up on contact with the coffee. My girlfriend and I recommend visiting one of the patisseries down past Leidesplein where they have good coffee for little over a euro, and a huge range of delicious pastries. Many shops sell fruit, more types than you could name, and these are also good for picking up a very fresh breakfast. The de Rappers were not all they were cracked up to be. We only saw Loes once the whole stay, and Hans on the occasions we did see him was loud and standoffish.

Without meaning to sound like I'm complaining, one day our room was not cleaned or our towels changed. This posed no real problem, but does underline the overall service as nothing special.

If you have some free time take the opportunity to walk the few blocks from the hotel to the Vondelpark which is a very large green park with several streams and ponds.
