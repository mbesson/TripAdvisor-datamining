We didn't want to pay too much but really wanted to stay on the island. We stayed 4 nights and paid 159 EUROS for the week days and 179 EUROS for the weekend nights for a superior double room with a view of the canal. The room was on the top floor up 3 flights of stairs (no lift) but the size of the room and bathroom more than made up for it! It was a shabby chic room with a large double bed and large en-suite bathroom. The two windows overlooked the small canal outside which was a lovely plus, but not one I'm sure we'd pay the extra for again. I think the non-superior (i.e. no view) rooms were about 139 EUROS but not sure of their size. As this was our first trip to Venice however I'm glad we did! We did wake up to the sound of gondola and water taxi horns as they rounded the corner of the canal but this didn't bother us as we were eager to get out and about and explore more of the many sights Venice has to offer. The guy who ran the reception in the morning was a little brusque, however the guy who ran the desk at night could not have been more helpful. He always welcomed us warmly and offered lots of advice on what to do the next day, pointing out which vaporetta to get to travel to various places. His two top tips were: One to visit Murano - he gave us a card to present at one of the glass shops upon which we were ushered into the back-room factory to watch Antonio create a cat and a horse from the melted glass straight from the furnace. This was obviously a special treat and not one available to all. We also visited Burano where they make lace - this is a very pretty little island with colourful houses. Finally we visited the lido to see the old hotels such as Hotel du Bain - we were a little disappointed however as the public beach is overrun and a bit dirty and the large hotels own the other stretches of beach along the coast. I'd give this a miss unless you're willing to pay an extortionate amount to use one of the private beaches. The second tip was to give us free entry to the casino - there is a free water taxi from nearby which takes you to the casino entrance making sure you arrive in style. If you don't have a dinner jacket you can rent on there. We even won enough to take a midnight gondola trip which was just magical!! We'd decided previously we weren't going to shell out up to \u00c2\u00a3150 to share a gondola with other tourists - or at best to ride alongside another whilst the gondoliers chatted in the queue through the canals. However this was something else - we managed to negotiate the fee to \u00c2\u00a3100 and it was well worth it - we had the canals to ourselves with only the lapping water and the whispers of the gondolier pointing out Casanova's house for company while we sipped on little bottles of Prosecco we'd bought from a nearby shop :o) Other top tips would be to avoid buying drinks (alcoholic) with lunch - it doesn't seem to matter where you are they can cost as much as your food. We quickly realised it was nicer to buy a beer from one of the street vendors or cafe's with a bar on the street and take it to sit somewhere nice and enjoy the view after a long day's sightseeing. We did have a couple of glasses of Prosecco on our first evening in St. Marc's square which is a must - they cost 10 EUROS each, but a cup of tea cost 9! Another tip would be to eat like a local in Dorsodura - we sat in the far right corner of the main square (from the hotel) and shared the most delicious risotto I've ever had, with a couple of proseccos and a bottle of wine for about 60 EUROS - a bargain in Venice. We also were accompanied by a huge group of old Venetians and the men got up to serenade their wives - it was lovely!! My only negatives about the hotel were the breakfast was tea and a couple of rolls with spreadable cheese - we usually ended up buying elevenses somewhere as it wasn' t enough to fuel all the walking we were doing. Also, the shower didn't attach to the wall over the bath.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Larnaca", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel ever\u201d", "Author": "LarnacaCy", "ReviewID": "UR115005289", "Content": "So....just to be clear i am not someone that is picky BUT this hotel is NOT worth going to.

First the good: - the owners, particularly the english-speaking father, were very friendly. they provided us with many decent suggestions of things to do, unbidden. even though i'd already been to venice before a couple of times and really didn't need any advice about the main sights, it still was very nice of them and they should get credit for it. -the location is easy for train/bus arrivals/departures. it's near the railway station and piazzale roma, so if you arrive by bus or train it's particularly convenient and within easy walking distance. don't be misled by the other reviews: venice is small, so once the bags are deposited pretty much any location is fairly convenient. but this is no less convenient than others, and it is quiet. again, don't be misled: anywhere outside of the san marco / rialto sites immediate area is going to be a pretty quiet hotel. then the bad: -the hotel has a serious mosquito problem. we got absolutely eaten alive, with the windows to our room closed. when we looked around, the room was swarming with mosquitos. I must have killed 10 of them, and they were all over. that happened nowhere else in venice; it was WITHOUT QUESTION a hotel issue. trust me on this one, it would be impossible for the staff not to know about it. and nobody said/did anything about it. it is almost unfathomable that they'd knowingly vend this room. in reality, this issue is the only reason i am writing this review. -the hot water was out and they neglected to apologize or say anything to warn. -the website shows tables with chairs next to each other against a brick wall and gives the impression of a nice dining area. there is none: you have breakfast in your room, which is good or bad depending on your point of view. forgetting about infestations or whatever for a moment, it means you need to know the night before when you, say, want your coffee in the morning. if you're good at predicting that, fine. otherwise it's annoying. also, the breakfast itself is a bunch of prepackaged breads and croissants: it's like what you'd get at a supermarket, not a bakery. not a particularly appetizing thing. also, breakfast is served from 8:30 - 10:30, so if you need to get up early and were hoping for a cappucino that's included in your stay, forget it. (not that i asked for an exception to this - and the older owner was nice enough that i get the impression he'd bring breakfast outside of stated hours - but per the posted timetable that's the deal). -there's no elevator, which for us was fine (young, in shape, etc). if this was a pension i'd give it a pass on this one, but for a hotel that charges EUR120 or so per night, you'd expect at least a mention of that on the website. all in all, you're probably better off staying in a cheap pension (same stuff for less money and the priceless addition of no bugs) - but the real solution is just to use one of the countless other hotels in venice that are basically the same as this one, charge the same as this one, and have a location as convenient as this one, but don't have any of the many problems this one has. especially the mosquitos - everything above is forgivable, to me, except for that.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Flyingphilt", "ReviewID": "UR29281716", "Content": "The room was very clean and the staff friendly.
