Anyway because it is close to the station I found it really noise, I was there for a meeting in rome and I was looking for a hotel close to the meeting venue otherwise I wouldn't stay in this area. Breakfast apart the hotel category might certainly be improved: a good coffee and a brioches do not cost a lot in Italy whilst they served a really bad English coffee and some bread and marmellades with butter.

Also they were like angry at oss all the time, like: \"go away, we dont like tourists and would like to have our hotel emty rather\". I had feling like this. 2. Many stairs, difficult with luggage and baby pram. 3. You can say that there is no breakfest att all, so bad it was. And lady working at breakfest was unbelivable unfreindly. The only good thing was location, it was close to central station and all nice things to see. I understad that it is cheap hotle with little stars, but I would not give any star to this hotel.

Good location but unfriendly staff, poor service\u201d", "Author": "davidloncke", "ReviewID": "UR60387192", "Content": "We stayed for 6 nights. In general we had no troubles, but the personel is neither friendly nor helpful. They are rather arrogant and with low attention for the guests. They gave us the impression of being not interested and ignorant. First of all, at arrival we wanted to arrange our taxi transport back to the airport (because we needed to catch our plane very early - at the time public transport in Rome isn't running yet) and the receptionist told us to arrange that just the day before we would leave. Though I like things to be arranged in time. And after 2 days of stay, we insisted on arranging our transport, but with the same answer. The day before we left (in the very morning) we asked the receptionist to arrange our transport, though he seemed to have his doubts if there still would be transport available. While we went eating breakfast, he supposedly called the service, but when we came back up he only had the message for us that it was full booked and we would need to arrange it ourselves through city taxi. We went for our last day into the city rather worried and frustrated, taking into account we allready wanted to have it arranged since the day we arrived. Though in the evening, when we came back to the hotel, we asked again (to another receptionist) and he seemed to find it strange that the service was full booked, so he called while we were in front of him and in the end, it seemed no problem at all to arrange the transport. The breakfast is eatable, though nohting special (which is said to be common in Italy). It wasn't bad, but not really the greatest breakfast we've eaten (and we are not really difficult guests). There was coffee (waterish), and tea, milk, powder orange juice, bread (rather hard) and some jam, honey and butter (for a Belgian, Itallian butter really doesn't taste great). They also had some kind of weird tasting sweet bread (which my wife liked). The room was rather big, with a closet and a little desk. It had TV with a lot of channels, though all in Itallian (not that it matters, because we didn't go to Rome to watch TV). However it was usefull for the weather report and some news (if you understand a little Itallian) The bathroom was rather small, with a little bathtub/shower, with plenty of hot water, though the bathroom needed some renovation. It had some humid spots and in the floor there's a lead to the drainings which smels bad at certain moments. And when you let go a big quantity of water from the tub, it would come out of the lead. Though, you can shower in peace. Something weird about the toilet is that it was rather narrow and not totally comfortable. For our stay in Rome it was good, if we compare it to the price we paid to stay pretty much in the center, because the hotel is literally at 200 meters from the Termini Station, from where you can connect to anywhere in the city, by bus tram and metro or taxi and to the airport by train, bus (by day) or taxi. Around the hotel there are plenty of little restaurants where the food is OK and payable. Though in general we have to say that the Italian food is not as great as we expected and as you might expect. It's rather overcalled for what it actually is. The ideas are good, but unfortunately the Italians are not really the refined cooks they pretend to be. What we really found good and worthy it's fame is the Italian ice cream. In general Romans are not friendly at all, rather arrogant and mainly to tourists, because when you hear them speaking to each other they use a total other tone and higher level of friendliness. Next time we go to Rome we would consider to stay somewhere else, though in the same area. If there's no other hotel in the same price cathegory and it's the absolute only option, we would stay again, though only for it's LOCATION", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kinross, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cOh Dear.........\u201d", "Author": "FunFunFun48", "ReviewID": "UR11286859", "Content": "Where do i begin?? I went to this hotel with a large number of other people and we found that it was horrendous.

After the increible climb to actually get to our room you find that it is very basic and not very well cleaned. Noise and heat were both issues as well, the lack of AC meant that you had to keep the windows open all of the time and the room was still unbelievably hot. However the worst thing i have to say was the friendlyness and the helpfullness of the hotel staff. On one occasion a friend and i were called stupid and were told to go elsewhere by the receptionist because we were asking for help.

The Hotel: The hotel is definitely not one i would like to spend conscious time in, just sleep. The rooms arent very nice, and the hotel has no amenities apart from a tv in the room and a pc for people to use (price ok). Breakfast is terrible, but it does the job. If breakfast is important to you, then this is def a no-no. Worst part is having to listen to Celine Dion Album every morning of the week. AAAAaaarrrrrgggghhhhh!!!!
