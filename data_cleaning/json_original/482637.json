You will need at least one hour and 25 min to city centre. By the way, bus is always full, but always. You will have to share the space in bus with a lot of people who are not so polite.

For the price you pay you really are getting an excellent 3 star hotel. The staff were very nice and very helpful. The continental breakfast was toast (continental style), cappucino/tea and any number of fresh pastries you cared to consume - fab! This really suited me because while on holiday, like many, I love to indulge. All rooms were very clean with excellent fitted furniture, satellite TV and a well stocked mini-bar. The hotel staff cannot speak any English - please bear this in mind because you are in Italy's capital and it is their native language! Learn a little Italian before you go - it is a must. I did and was able to converse a little with the staff and out and about. The hotel is a little way out of Rome (about 9 K) but providing you sort out the busses you are fine. From Ciampino airport the No 64 Coteral bus will take you to Anagnina station - change here for a No 20 Atac bus that will take you to Via Silicella along the Casalina road - BUT make sure you ask for the stop or it will go past. The bus drivers are very helpful and even gave us directions to the hotel. To conclude - this hotel is a must if you don't mind travelling in to Rome each day.

As we flew with Ryanair, we were able to take advantage of the Terravision shuttle service from the airport into the centre of Rome (very much cheaper than taxis), which was particularly useful since we arrived in Rome at 9am but couldn't check in to hotel until 2pm. Having spent our first day in Rome we took the bus from Termini (central bus station) to our hotel. One website we looked at before hand said the bus needed was No. 20 but it was in fact No. 105. Be prepared for a 'fun' journey- this bus can be very crowded in the evenings.The bus stop is on the Via Casilina but be warned- this is a VERY long road and in actual fact, the bus stop seems further away than you think- past all the busy retail areas, towards the GFR (ringroad). I always looked out for a shop called Kourno (the first 'o' of this word had a ^ on top), a cross-roads, and a big Renault building. The hotel isn't very well signposted so keep a look out. From the centre of Rome, Jonico is on the Righthandside of the road. Another thing, it isn't exactly on the main road, its a few minutes away on a side street, but you can see a sign post directing you to it (Via Sillicella). Bus services are available until midnight in the summer and after this there is a nighttime bus service (but I'm not sure how frequent these latter buses are). The bus can take between 30- 60+ minutes, depending on the traffic, so try to get a seat! As another review has pointed out, you need to pre-purchase bus tickets (not available on the buses)- we got ours from a tabacconist in Termini station. E11 for 3 days, E1 for unlimited travel for 75 minutes. Make sure you validate your bus tickets using the on-board machines- we saw other people getting fined >E50 by inspectors for not having validated tickets. The hotel itself is fine, very clean and well maintained. We didn't have a problem with noisy neighbours or anything but did find the main road traffic a little noisy, particularly since there appears to be many ambulances about. Breakfast... well what can I say? It consisted of coffee, fruit juice and a donut/ croissant but we weren't expecting much anyways! In terms of service, the reception staff were quite 'frosty', however we seemed to encounter this throughout our stay in Rome, in bars, restaurants and by the general public- I don't think its the staff at the hotel in particular. I get the general impression that we would have been more kindly treated if we could speak some Italian (I'm a bit ashamed to say I didn't know a single word!) so I would definitely recommend you learn a few phrases before coming here. Having said this, the cleaning staff were terrific- really friendly and welcoming. There didn't appear to be a hotel restaurant or much of a bar and in fact there are not many restaurants/bars in the viscinity and so it might be a good idea to eat before returning to the hotel. Overall, I don't think Hotel Jonico is the ideal choice for a stay in Rome because of the distance from the centre of Rome but was fine for budget travellers (probably best of no child0ren), who don't mind bus travel and who don't plan to spend too much time in their hotel.", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grimsby", "Title": "\u201cHotel to far from centre\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5025360", "Content": "Firstly when arriving at the airport do not get in a taxi if a person comes towards you and offers you his services,cue in the taxi rank .My wife and I jumped in a taxi thinking it was just like the U.K.unfortunately it is not we got well fleeced from the Airport to the Hotel it was 55 Euros for a ten minute ride.This left an extremely bitter taste in our mouths however as I dont try to dwell to much in the past I thought I will not let this ruin our holiday .The Hotel in general is quite nice but very basicbut be prepared for 30 minutes bus ride to Rome Centre.The staff do not speek much English neither and you can only get breakfast which is continental ,quasants and cappuchino.We arrived on the Thursday and on Friday the Buses and the Metro where on strike so getting aTaxi to come to the Hotel was impossible and most dont bother as it is to far out.So if you do fancy Rome get a Hotel in the centre near the Termini this is where all the buses and trains run into .If you do decide to stay at the Hotel you can get a bus into Rome Centre it is the 105but do be prepared to be sqeezed in almost pilchard like, you can get the bus tickets from the shop Tabichini these are like our newsagents and cost us 22 Euros for a 3 day pass this entitles you to travel on the buses and metro,however it does not allow you to get on the tour buses.The bus that takes you back to the airport stands behind a large orange building in the Termini centre and the tickets can be obtained in the main Termini centre.Hope this may be of some use so be careful not to get to fleeced and try to stick to buses also do go and see the sights on the 110 tour bus which you can book a ticket for in the Termini information which is in the centre of the bus depot.The Sistine chapel and the vatican museum are a must but be prepared to cue .", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cFar from the City Centre\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4326247", "Content": "I have no kids, I'm ok with public transportation, and on a limited budget.
