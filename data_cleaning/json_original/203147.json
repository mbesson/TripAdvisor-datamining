It's in a great location between the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain, tucked away on a quiet street. Our stay there was less than great. Our first room was terrible (room # 404) - the bed was very uncomfortable, it sagged in the middle; the room was extremely small; and the shower was awful. The half glass door in the shower did not keep in the water and each time we took a shower, the entire bathroom got wet. There were puddles all over the floor. The front desk staff at the hotel is hit or miss (like I read on another review). We told the front desk about the issue and the man called maintenance and brushed us off. That same front desk clerk gave us very bad directions to the Borghese Gallery. The next day we complained about our room to a different front desk clerk, who was very nice and helpful. They moved us to room 307, which was much better - the bed was very comfortable, the room was spacious and we didn't have any trouble with the shower. If we would have had room 307 the entire stay, our review would be much different and more positive overall. The decor in the hallways is very dated and in desperate need of updating. The breakfast was okay. We would possibly stay at this hotel again based on location, but I'd want to ensure we'd receive a room like 307.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cSIMPLY INCREDIBLE!\u201d", "Author": "veronicamorali", "ReviewID": "UR121596124", "Content": "My family and I had such an excellent stay at this hotel.

The staff was very attentive and helpful, too. This is a smaller hotel (about 50 rooms) so you get more attention to detail. The room was not huge but quite adequate and the bathroom was very clean and a nice size. Lots of closet space, too. The morning breakfast was very nice and served in a quaint, quiet dining room, just off the main lobby. You could tell that the other people staying at this hotel also enjoyed the quiet atmosphere.

The bathroom was very clean and tidy. No sure about pillows or mattress age. This is NOT a 4 star hotel by any shape of the imagination.

As others have said this hotel is in a great location. You can easily walk to many of the major sites. We did not use public transport at all and walked to the colosseum, vatican and everything else inbetween. Our room was bigger than expected considering at lot of reviews mentioned small rooms, it was a little tired looking and could do with a spruce up, but thats the only negative about the room, and such a small thing it's almost not worth mentioning. The hotel was a lot cheaper than others in the area and in my opinion in a much better location as it is not on a main road or busy tourist cut through. We were facing the small street and had our window open all night and were not disturbed at all. We had no problems with the bed or the pillows and did not find them too hard, but I suppose it is all personal taste. Most of the staff were friendly and helpful, however as we were leaving the hotel to get our taxi to the airport, I tripped on the rug in reception as it has ruffled up (very dangerous!) and landed quite hard on the marble floor, only the porter asked if I was ok, whilst the member of reception pulled the carpet straight, neither member of staff helped me up or came to my assistance. Whilst I do take some responsibility for the fall, the carpet is not secured down is very dangerous and no-one from the hotel apologised. My husband was left to help me up on his own and help me out to the taxi.

A 5 minute walk gets you to Spanish Steps, a 10 minute walk gets you to the Trevi Fountain. Despite its great proximity to these and many other great sites in Rome, the hotel is located on a quite street and that's saying something in Rome. Rome is busy to say the least, people, cars, scooters everywhere.....but this hotel allows an escape just a few blocks from the crowds which was really important. The staff were helpful and friendly, the hotel offers a modest breakfast which was sufficient....could use a few more options however. Our room had a private outdoor patio surrounded by citrus trees, which was really nice. As mentioned, the pillows on the beds feel like they're filled with sand....very hard and somewhat uncomfortable...the beds are very firm as well.....though this was a minor complaint. We were able to walk to the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the Forum and other great spots....only taking a cab to the Baths of Caracalla (great ruins to visit by the way) and the Vatican. Avoiding cabs in Rome is a good thing considering the few times we did take them we were hustled by the cabbies. We had room service one night, which was prompt and delicious. Wifi is available in the room and in the lobby, but there are ongoing charges for that. In my opinion, wifi should be a standard, included feature. Just outside the front door to the right you'll find a very small convenient market to by food and supplies, plus a little coffee shop that makes a good cappuccino. If taking cabs, I would strongly suggest getting a small hotel address card to show cabbies. Most didn't know by name where this hotel was, but a quick look at the address card removed the confusion completely.

Got good off-season rates through Expedia and chose this hotel because of its wonderful location near the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps, on a quiet side street. The hotel is understated luxurious, cozy with good heating in the cool season (has air conditioning in summer), and with new, tight-fitting windows and doors which screen out noise for very quiet rooms even on the street side. Bathrooms with bidets and lots of hot water, rooms very clean and well appointed, beds comfortable. Staff is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and helpful in every way. We are experienced travellers and know some language but needed help with museum and show reservations and with routes, busses, etc. They provided all that and more, making calls for us and recommending tours (which we did not use but which looked good.) The breakfasts at this hotel are great -- a buffet with local yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit and juices, cakes, eggs, meats, cheeses, When you come down to the attractive dining room, the server brings you a large pot of coffee or the beverage of your choice (excellent cappuchino or hot chocolate available) and a large basket of freshly made rolls and croissants, also there are yummy Hero jams in little jars on your table. We did not try out the bar or restaurant service at night, preferring to go to local trattoria, but they looked nice, if expensive. Hotel is a few steps from the Quirinale, the Trevi Foutain, the Spanish Steps, and within easy walking distace from the Forum and Colloseum, and many museums. Also one block from Silvestro Square where many busses terminate, making getting around (to the Vatican, the Termini etc.) extremely easy. There is a grocery store next door selling everything including good local (cheap) wine and deli items for picnics. Also a cafe across the street for late day coffee, and several less expensive tourist gift shops. Just another block away on Via Trittone, many good shops and boutiques. On the way to that street, just a few steps from the hotel, a delightful small local restaurant with reasonable prices and excellent simple fresh local food at reasonable prices and friendly service, (with signs saying Pizza.) My husband and I had our birthdays while we were there (we were born on the same day), and apparently the staff had discovered this from our passports. When we returned in the late afternoon on that day, we found a bottle of iced Proseca wine (the local \"champagne\") and glasses in our room, compliments of the hotel staff!!

It is literally a 2 minute walk from the trevi fountain and a short 5-7 minute walk to spanish steps. We had pretty easy access to the train and took this to both termini station and vatican city. The hotel itself is modern looking and pretty clean. The halls looked slightly older but the room itself was in good shape and pretty new appearing. Bed was nice, and there was a decent sofa bed. If convenient location and newish clean rooms are important for you (they were for us, as after 2 wks of travel and various shoddy hotels I was desperate for a clean place), this is not a bad choice. Cons - when we got there, we were under the impression 3 people could stay in a 2 person room. They said this was not possible, and wanted us to pay 50 euros, but eventually gave us a 3 person room. It was a smoker room, but they said they had nothing else available. From this point on I felt a reluctance in their service towards us, and an awkward tension, which I would not expect from a 4-star hotel. Our bags took 2 hours to get to our room, and only after calling did they come up. They initially didn't turn on the heat, and we had to ask. The bathroom ceiling was initially dripping, but they took care of it the next day without any issues. Overall I thought the desk people working in the daytime were not very accomodating or friendly. Also, they charged us 18 EUROS for a subpar breakfast, as we did not initally know this was included. Finally, internet is VERY expensive - 12 euros for 24 hours or so. Overall thoughts: Service was not up to par with a 4-star place. However, I picked up on a general lower standard of service in Italy on the whole, so this was consistent with that. After staying in very shoddy places in Barcelona and Florence though, the clean rooms and fabulous location here were pleasant surprises.

It was worth to arrive by taxi since the hotel is somewhat difficult to find. Most are in that area. Very centrally located we walked to all sightseeing attractions. The Spanish Steps, Fontana Di Trevi, The Colosseum, The Vatican, and all kinds of cafes, restaurants, and shopping.

AC worked fine and overall like I said a nice room. The breakfast was ok... eggs, bacon, cold cuts, fruits, yogurt, etc... Price to quality ratio is excellent. We paid 182 per night including breakfast and taxes. So, I definitly recommend Hotel Dei Borgognoni.

Good fruit selection but only one type of ham and no freshly sliced cheese, just pre-packed stuff. The hot offering didnt look very appealing to be honest. Excellent coffee though ! The good points are the location, the quality bathrooms and the room sizes which I thought were good for Rome. Also the beds are huge and very comfortable. Quite firm but wonderful if you like a firm mattress. Bad points included some rude staff, intermittent aircon, ill fitting bath plugs, a redecoration needed and building work (see pic) right outside the room on the apartment opposite.

The directions that staff gave to the closest metro station weren't great, and combined with pouring rain didn't leave a very good last impression of our stay.", "Date": "November 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat small hotel!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4024692", "Content": "Very nice small hotel.

It is so easy to miss, since it blends in with the small cozy neighborhood, which is a 1/2 block from the main street Tritone. The Trivi Fountain was two blocks out to the right and the Spanish steps was six out to the left. Anything you could want to do was within walking distance. The buses and metro could easily be caught on Tritone. The room was a nice size for any city standards. They were clean and decorated elegantly.
