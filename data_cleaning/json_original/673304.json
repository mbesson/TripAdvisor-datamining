{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Class Trip I stayed at the Olivaer Apart Hotel in Berlin back in 2003.I had taken German in school for four years so we got the pleasure of going on a tour of Germany. Our first stop was in Berlin and we stayed in this hotel for two nights. Before going to Germany our teacher warned us that we wouldn't be staying in 5 star hotels so we were all expecting something dumpy. I got to stay in a room with two of my best friends. We thought our room was awesome. The whole place looked old and neat. The ceilings were really high and we had hardwood floors in our room. It had a huge window to look out tand a chandelier. We went and visited our classmates rooms and they weren't as neat and big as ours. We did have alot of trouble with our keys though, almost every day, as they were really old. Our room was always very clean and the down blankets were very nice. We stayed in four hotels all throughout Germany and this was our favorite even though we stayed at newer more modern hotels. I would recommend it for a trip of sightseeing or business, but not anything romantic. Depends what your taste is.", "Date": "Sep 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR107897813", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kje1985"}, {"Content": "old but no complaints       Quadruple Room 2", "Date": "Feb 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR675903622", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "David-QPS"}, {"Content": "Spacious and Clean!! On arrival at Olivaer Apartments we were greeted by extremely friendly staff at the front desk.The foyer area is very bland and brown looking, most of this apartment building is original fittings from what im guessing would be at least 50 years old..dont worry it looks antique like..not falling apart!!We stayed in a tripple room which was very clean and spacious. We had 2 balconies which over looked the street below. The beds were comfortable and we had a couch that also folded out. the bathroom was very small but did the job!Restaurants are very close and one bus can be caught down to the main city. Breakfast is served in the morning with a large variety of meats and cereals available. Free internet is also supplied in the main foyer.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR401772178", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "shazel"}, {"Content": "Muy buena opci\u8d38n       Habitaci\u8d38n", "Date": "Nov 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR267336835", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Pareja_espa\u5e3dola"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d673304-r19983410-Top_Olivaer_Apart_Hotel_Berlin-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "673304", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
