We were a family of four traveling with another family of five from Melbourne. It was hard trying to find a hotel that would house both families but the Leisure in fit the bill. My family had the quad room on the sixth floor with a street view while our traveling companiens had a family room on the first floor. The hotel is about a half hour walk or so from the Opera House down on Circcular Quey. We had five kids all under the age of 12 and all of them had no trouble with the walk. There are many buses along George street you can catch if your not up to walking. China town is close by with lots of food options. We caught a train to the Bondi junction then took a bus to Bondi Beach which was alot of fun and we saw some of the cast from Bondi Rescue patrolling the beach. My daughter thought that was awesome. If your up for a fun night out try the Wentworth greyhound races just a ten minute walk away. Back to the hotel, all was fine the bed was comfy and the bathroom clean. The only thing the hotel could do would be to touch up the lower parts of the paint on the walls of the room as there were alot of scuff marks from peoples luggage. The elevator was extremly slow but all in all I would stay here again", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFine for a night or 2\u201d", "Author": "Eerinbmac", "ReviewID": "UR126812401", "Content": "I stayed here for one night and found it basic but comfortable.

The more later you check out, the more it will cost!!!! which i thought was exorbitant. Not only that, there's no free WIFI and internet charges are expensive. Also, the reception is only open at certain times and if you don't have your keycard when reception is closed, to enter the door... they will have to call a locksmith and you will incur the cost. (i was advised when i was checking in) the room itself was OK....bed was a bit soft. I was in the hotel room with double bed and shower. The shower was good, but the walls are paper thin. I could hear next door talking. I think this stay is OK for one night but not anymore. I stayed here on a Saturday night and paid AUD$189.

We knew that this would be the case, and certainly the Leisure Inn was one of the (comparatively) less expensive options in Sydney that weekend, but the rate we paid made it especially painful when the hotel nickel and dimed us for every conceivable thing - $15 for a day on Internet access, $1 to place a local call plus $1 per minute for the call itself, $2 per bag to store bags after check-out, etc. etc. This place seemed far more concerned with lining its pockets than providing exceptional service. This is a pet peeve of mine even when I am not paying a hugely inflated room rate for a special occasion. That said, it's very convenient to the Central train station, and clean. You can walk or take a quick train ride to a lot off different parts of Sydney - Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Circular Quay, etc. Front desk staff were friendly and adequately helpful. Nothing above and beyond when it came to guest service, but no gripes either. The temperature in our room was very difficult to balance- we were either freezing or the room was stuffy. Very litte ambience and our window looked out on an oh-so-charming brick wall. I'd say the convenient location is worth it if you're exploring Sydney a bit and paying $100 or less per night.

They lady advise that i could either call before 9pm to get the instructions, or use the intercom upon arrival. Around 8pm, i called to try to get the instructions for after hour check in, but the person answering the phone, told us to use the intercom. This contradicts what the lady had told me in the morning. Upon arrival, I used the intercom and spoke to a man whose accent made it hard to understand. Even with a customer who was staying at the hotel assisting us, we still had no luck. Had to try to use the intercom again and try hard to understand the man, before we finally found the area to access the key safe. 2) Upon entering, notice that the carpet had orange stains and was dirty with about 15 fluffs scattered near the entry way. 3) The grout/tiles in the bathroom was grey coloured and seemed dirty. 4) When i booked this room, i didn't expect my room to have no windows. I understand from reading management's that there is 2 tier room. However, it would be more informative to customers if your description of the standard room actually indicated \"no windows\". This would then give the right expectation to new customers. Had i known, i would not have booked the standard room which felt like a prison. 5) The description also stated foxtel. However, this was just the basic foxtel package, and did not have Fox sports at all. Which was disappointing. Most hotel description, when they say \"foxtel\", they have most channels, not just about 8 foxtel channels. 6) As others have pointed out, the air cond unit is still very noisy. It seems the engineers have not really fixed the noise issue.

Yes, they may tell you at reception that you can't get the complimentary upgrade (which was part of the booking 'subject to availability') because it's such a 'busy time of year'.

The vanity unit in the bathroom looked almost new. The mattresses were firm and felt very new. The TV was a small modern LCD, with a few free Foxtel channels. Our twin room was small and very narrow, with two single beds butted against each other head-to-head along the wall, with a low partition to separate them. Both bedheads had lamps attached. There was a cupboard to hang clothes, a writing desk and chair, a small fridge ... and that's about it for furnishings. Like I said, nothing flash. Bathroom was clean, shower head was 'rainforest' style and felt strangely luxurious in such a quirky little room ... aircon worked and was quiet, colours were fairly neutral and there was NO outside noise - not bad for half a block from George Street. We felt safe in the hotel and our door had swipe cards which worked without fault. We were staying overnight for a concert at the Entertainment Centre - we walked to the venue and had dinner at Chinatown beforehand.

We chose it because the rates for other hotels in Sydney were quite high for what they were offering, and figured since we weren't going to be spending much time in the room anyway, it would be fine. The rooms are bare bones basic accomodations that are definitely on the small side. We had one room with a view of a brick wall and then one room with no windows at all. If you plan to spend any time chilling in your room, it can get pretty depressing. Liked: - It's closer to the airport than other central Sydney hotels. It costs about the same for 2 people to take the airport shuttle as it does a taxi (28 to 30 AUD). If you are traveling alone, the airport shuttle is cheaper at 14 AUD one way. -Our airport shuttle (which we booked with reception) was horribly late due to an undisclosed \"problem\", and the receptionist on duty spent over 20 minutes on the phone with the shuttle company and attending to us. We were refunded our shuttle fare and he gave us enough to pay for a taxi to the airport. Disliked: -It's on the periphery of central Sydney, by Chinatown, so it's a bit of a hike to get to the main sighs like the Rocks or ferry terminals. If you don't mind the walk it isn't a problem. The neighborhood isn't dangerous at all but it's not great. -Our blanket obviously had not been washed since it was last used by another guest. There was a caked on stain, either from milk or something more unpleasant. -Our drinking glasses were also dirty. Maybe they had been rinsed but definitely not been washed with soap. -The maid left our door open (!) after cleaning one night. We immediately reported it to reception asked us if anything had been taken, but then also informed is that they knew that particular door had been having some issues and the maids had accidentally left it open in the past. Nothing was taken but I don't understand why precautions weren't already taken by housekeeping if they already knew about this problem. I appreciated the efforts of the staff attending to our needs during our stays there, but I would not stay here again due to what I consider unacceptable security problems and unsanitary conditions.

You are not able to turn it on/off by yourself. I was told by the receptionist that the air-con is centrally controlled and will automatically kick in when the outside temperature reaches some certain degree. Sounds like an intelligent system but I don't think it's practically good for a hotel where different guests have different preferences for their comfortable temperature.

The bed was fine and decor was modern. There was a small LCD TV and bar fridge in the room. There was no mini toiletries, these were in dispensers on the wall, but always full.

As we paid online, we basically did not deal with the staff from there on, but there was never any other issues for us on our stay. We took the train to central and it was an easy walk to the hotel. The area though near central station was never very scary for me and my girlfriend. Although getting to the centre of the city/darling harbour wasnt that easy as just for a short ride, it costs alot on the train. It was however very close to chinatown. We had a view directly of a brick wall although that was never really a concern. There was no street noise, but the doors are thin and there was a slit between the door and the floor so it was quite easy to hear noise from doors slamming and the hallway.

Overall I'm very happy with my choice and for the savings I could easily take the train and/or take a taxi from darling harbour or the quay back to hotel and still save plenty.

So for further reference the hotel is on a part of Regent St that is an extension of Harris St. We found resonibly priced parking on Thomas St off Quay St approx $18 per 24 hours which was cheaper than the recommended carpark of $25 per 24 hours. We dropped off our bags at the hotel (4 hr parking out front) and then leisurely drove the car round and left it in the carpark for 2 days.
