The room was affordable, very clean and always immaculate when we'd return in the evening. Shower facilities were too, nice and clean. My ONLY reservation about the Hotel Crystal is the very cramped shared toilet. I'm only 5ft 11\" yet had difficulty using the WC comfortably. Breakfast consisted of some nice cold meats, cheeses, egg, toast etc. (Continental) and was more than enough to set us up for the day. Staff too were always on hand and very helpful (like a lot of the Dutch we met). Just outside Liedesplien, the Hotel Crystal is a mere 5 minute walk to Liedesplien itself and from here the No. 1 tram will take you anywhere of interest in the city (including back to Centraal Station for the journey home). Liedesplien has all you need to enjoy a great time in Amsterdam but don't let that stop you from seeing the rest of what is an amazing city. Liedesplien has great coffee-shops (e.g. 'The Rookies'), great food (like all you can eat ribs for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 from the Sports bar next to The Bull Dog bar, again very cool place) and many other nice bars and restaurants.

Simple, free breakfast was also served: some bread/rolls, ham/salami slices, cheese, hard boiled eggs, juice/coffee/tea. Nothing fancy but enough to hold anyone over until lunch. Since Amsterdam is a bit expensive when it comes to food, I made some sandwiches and packed it in my bag for some snacking/mini picnic in Vondel park.

I'm 6 foot tall and just able to use the shared wc with a bit of contortion, and although it was clean the wc room was smaller than an in-flight wc, and that's small. However, on the last day I realised that there is a larger wc on the ground floor - use that one if you can, its okay.

The hotel was quiet although some of the guests were very rowdy on one of the nights. Alcohol is very popular at night in Amsterdam along with other things. It's always inconsiderate guests wherever you go. Breakfast was modest in selection but fresh and adequate.

There were a couple of ants in my room- not really big deal- I killed them and did not see any others, but the last night of my stay, there was a mouse in my room!!!!!! when i requested something be done, the receptionist refused to do so, and he told me all rooms were booked. The next day I found out there was one room open that had not been booked, but \"most likely that receptionist lied to me because they have people come in in the late night for rooms and I would have taken up a valuable quad room.\" Then he blamed ME for the mouse because I had un-opened candybars in 2 zipblock bags-- I was on the 2nd floor, and i don't think a mouse smells candybars 2 floors up in a hotel and runs up there; especially considering there is a breakfast room and kitchen with food that is not in air tight packaging.

Told the room was available but would have to pay there and then \"or when you come down\". Surprised by this but told them we would pay that morning. We were exhausted after a three week journey around Europe and my wife was not well, so we went upstairs to rest. After half an hour or so the receptionist came banging on our door asking us to pay. I told him it was usual to pay on leaving and anyway, was he really expecting me to leave without paying from a room on the second floor with loads of luggage and a three year old child under my arm? I have never heard such nonense. He just kept ranting on about his hotel policy and I am afraid I was just so tired and lacking patience to deal with him I just gently closed the door telling him I would come down and pay shortly. He was happy enough to take my credit card payment some ten minutes later (although he already had my credit card details anyway). Then on leaving the next morning, I had made it down the very steep stairs from the second floor with two backpacks, a suitcase, a pram and the child when he said I should go back upstairs to get the TV remote control. We were rushing for an international train and this was just the last straw. I told him he could get the remote himself and he said that we were now in Amsterdam and would have to do things as they do in Amsterdam, although the last time I looked Amsterdam was a rich, tolerant and modern European city where most people have got better things to do than steal TV remote controls after paying over 100 euros a night for a hotel. But he threatened to charge us another night unless we went back up and got it, even though I pointed out that the chambermaid was at that moment on the second floor and could get it for us. He then told me she was paid for cleaning not getting TV remote controls. I explained to him that we spent our money in his hotel and he was meant to provide the service. He then informed us that we only paid to sleep in the hotel, nothing more. So there you have it. The steep stairs are a feature of Amsterdam canal-side houses, which is characterful. However, be aware that the stairs are really steep and will pose problems for elderly or the young or anyone with mobility problems. The balcony in the room we had was equally pretty but dangerous for a child as it was only around half a metre high. The shower is in a corner of the toilet, with a shared floor, if you see what I mean. It threatens to overflow into the room as well as flooding the whole bathroom if you leave it on too long. No dead mice but a faint whiff in the rooms. Breakfast is OK for a hotel of this standard but surely in Amsterdam they should make real coffee instead of having a vending machine at breakfast. Breakfast room very cramped. Odd atmosphere among guests some of whom seem rather cowed by the experience. They also put little plastic bowls on the table for incidental rubbish such as the lids from jam portions, etc. Very strange and not what I come to a hotel for. Good internet access for 2 euros an hour. Beds comfortable if rooms and corridors a bit faded. One receptionist who was on duty at night, unlike the one mentioned above, was very helpful and pleasant. Seemed not to be a \"company man\".

Quoted wrong price initially at check-in. Led to filthy double room up 3 flights of tiny stairs. Window would not stay open in middle of summer. Ended up with bug bites from pillows. Manager is possibly rudest man alive and charged us for full stay though we left after 2 days owing to state of room. Also, he never believed us when we complained that there was a problem (like when the safe wasn't working). He would berate us and then try to prove us wrong--proving himself wrong in the process. He never once apologized, only muttered to himself and tried to fix it.", "Date": "July 14, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Crystal", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d263960-Reviews-Hotel_Crystal-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$86 - $232*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2e Helmersstraat 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1054 CH</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "263960", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b7/0d/b70dd29d77094b258f4747a64e81ab694large.jpg"}}
