It is NOT a hotel!!! It is university dorms (which by the way being a student myself I would not have paid to stay in these dorms) they advertise a pool??? There is a local leisure centre half a mile up the road which you pay to use?? I'm surprised they didn't advertise a cinema and restaurant too because they also have those in the city centre? A private double room, gives you.. A room, with one small bed I would say more like a large single, with plastic thin camping matteress, oh and you have just enough room to scoot around the bed (bearing in mind I am a petite girl) oh and a strange computer desk an a fridge! The \"kitchen ficilitys\" are cookers and microwaves... Don't expect even one piece of cutlery or any kind of cookware/utensils (so you can't actually cook anything here) the receptionist wanted me to leave my passport with him to borrow the one very questionable pot they dis have in reception... I declined! The breakfast is hilarious! A dry muffin and maybe a yogurt! Oh and there is no wifi (even though people stated there was some in reception we never found this) they offered us cable????? What is this noahs ark! It's the 20th century, and this is university dorms? Anyway we didn't want to pay anymore money for that either. To top it both lifts were broken throughout the week we were there and were very unreliable/dangerous if you did even get a chance to try them (I nearly had my head cut open when one of them was reapeatingly opening and closing when I was trying to get out) oh and did I mention is 15 floors high...

Luckily, it was not crowded on my floor and using the bathroom didn't cause as much problems, as I had anticipated. They do not provide free breakfast and we need to pay $7 everyday. The breakfast options are not that great either (coffee, bagels, muffins, corn flakes and croissants). The hotel lobby has free wi-fi and hence you need not get 'wired' internet in your room by shelling extra 5 bucks per day. They also charge $12 per day for parking. The location of the hotel is not good and any good restaurant is at least a 20 min walk away.

I live in a suburb of Montreal, but figured since it was included with the conference I'd take advantage and stay downtown for the weekend. The size of the room is pretty typical of a university resident. There's enough space to move around, but nothing extra. No Television. Wired (not wi-fi) Internet is available at a cost of $5/night, which is a little different from the norm of most hotels these days that have free wifi. As far as I can gather, all rooms permit smoking, since there was no \"non-smoking\" option at checkin and my room had an ashtray. I couldn't detect much of a smoky smell though, which is good since I don't smoke. The best thing about the hotel is their service. I would have expected some surly night guard to take care of check-ins at a place like this, but they have a fancy front desk area with very friendly staff. This may be cheap, but the staff talk to you like it's a 5-star hotel. Try to get a room on as high a floor as possible. I was in room 16111, and the views of downtown Montreal were amazing, especially at night. The windows open very wide, which is nice for getting a better view and letting in air. The beds are not very comfortable, especially the pillows...they seem to be all wrapped in a thick layer of plastic. I would suggest you bring your own pillow, and even foam matt if possible. The location is not ideal. It is located between two metro stations (\u00c3\u2030douard-Montpetit and Universit\u00c3\u00a9-de-Montr\u00c3\u00a9al). Being on the blue line, service is pretty infrequent, especially later in the evening. You have to transfer at Jean-Talon or Snowdon coming from downtown, where you might end up waiting over 10 minutes. Luckily there's a BIXI (public bicycle sharing) stand right in front which is handy for cruising down rue C\u00c3\u00b4te-Sainte-Catherine into the city, but you probably wouldn't want to bike back up the hill, so use of the metro is pretty much inevitable. In conclusion, Les Studios provides great views and clean, modern-looking rooms at a reasonable cost and with great service, but you aren't right downtown, so it's best only if you're attending something north of Mount Royal, or if you plan to bike over to the Plateau Mont-Royal. If I was paying my own way, I'd probably have picked one of the downtown hostels...they might not be quite as clean, and the service might not be as good, but at least you'd be right downtown in the middle of the action.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, Wales", "Title": "\u201cCould be better!\u201d", "Author": "ashokatomik", "ReviewID": "UR108556351", "Content": "Room adequate for 1 person.

Basically, it's a dorm. The service is pretty good, but the rooms are not welcoming. They are fine for sleeping, but the beds are hard, short, and the pillows strangely shaped, so I ended up sleeping on a rolled up towel. Otherwise, the painted concrete building kind of sucks. The other issue is that, given that this room is ok for sleeping but that's it, then people should be aware of the location. The nearest major street is 10-15 mins walk away, so you are pretty isolated. And the metro, while good, is 4-5 mins away, and requires a transfer to go downtown, so the other person's estimate of 20 mins downtown is very optimistic. It usually took me a full half hour. Overall, this place would be a decent hostelly option to me, as long as they presented themselves as such. I was very surprised by what I was getting having seen the website, and while I was there another (older) couple had a meltdown when they realized that they had reserved a university dorm room, when they thought it was a smallish hotel room, which the website really suggests.

Buyer beware: This is not what the average person would consider a 3 or 4 star hotel (it may be 4 stars with respect to onsite amenities but not in terms of room comfort etc). It's basically a university dormitory with shared bathrooms, horrible air circulation, and the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept on. Let me elaborate. Bed: The worst aspect of this place is the bed. The mattress *and* pillow are both covered with a hard plastic material under the sheets (I guess to protect against soiling) which are extremely uncomfortable... Like you have to experience this to believe it. i can't believe they think this is acceptable for anybody, and I'm not one who expects posh things out of life. Ive had trouble sleeping all week because of it, and as a result have missed lectures that I was supposed to attend due to sleepiness. Air Circulation: There is none. The room has a large window which you can open, but Im writing this review sitting 1 foot away from it and I cannot feel the slightest hint of a breeze, it must be constantly 27C in the room and its like 20C outside. This room is horribly designed. Other issues: The staff are superfriendly. The location is very convenient if you want to go to campus. And the rooms have a sink and fridge, which is a plus. Normally I would give this place 2 out of 5, but Im really annoyed with how they advertise themselves as a 4 star hotel, so Im bumping it down to a 1 star. They clean your room once a week. They have foosball tables, pool tables, chess etc in the lobby. If you're paying hostel prices for this place, maybe you'll be ok with it, but really think about what I've said!
