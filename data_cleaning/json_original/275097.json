The rooms are excellent, with comfy beds and enough space. The staff will answer any queries and offer help with anything you may need, recommending cafes and tapas bars or booking a scooter from a scooter hire shop. Although situated in a central position the hotel is very quiet and there is no noise from traffic or groups of tourists going home from a night on the Ramblas. Placa de Catalunya is very close and from there you can pick up the tourist buses which will take you all over the city to all the major tourist sites. Within walking distance is the Passeig de Gracia where you can find many cafes and tapas bars if you want something close to the hotel in the evening. When the sun is shining go down to the beaches and sit in a cafe drinking a beer. Or have a really good fish lunch in one of the restaurants directly on the beach. Another must is the Parc Guell, which is a little bit outside the main tourist area but well worth a visit. The tourist buses from Place de Catalunya will take you there. Don't only go to look at Sagrada Familia but pay the 12 \u20ac and go inside. The money goes towards finishing off the building which is absolutely spectacular, worth every penny.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lichfield", "Title": "\u201cClean, well run hotel with excellent breakfasts\u201d", "Author": "agj750", "ReviewID": "UR127873278", "Content": "This hotel is situated conveniently for buses and Metro links.

Placa Catalunya is two blocks away and the Passeig de Gracia metro stop allows one to use the subway as well as middle distance trains to places like Girona, Figueres, Sitges and Tarragona. Walking is an option to almost every part of the city and metered taxis are widely available. There is much to like about the Atrium Palace itself: * The front desk staff is friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. No request is too small or mundane. * The all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet @ 12.90 EU is to die for with a broad selection of quality meats, cheeses, fresh fruit, eggs, bread/rolls, pastries, and an array of drinks from coffee, juices, cava, wine, sparking water, etc. The serrano ham is worth the price of admission and you won't find better tomatoes anywhere, period. * Did I mention the location, location, location? * There is free WiFi throughout the hotel and also a business center with two free computers for guests. Nice not be gouged as many other hotels do. I was able to bring a U.S. iPhone and use the WiFi for e-mail, Internet and Skype calls. * The basement has a small pool, Jacuzzi with powerful jets (not always hot enough though) and an exercise room with limited equipment. Since most European hotels don't provide these type facilities, this was a plus in our book. Downsides: * Depending on where your room is (front or back), there is some noise. Many reviews have overblown the noise -- in our opinion -- at the back from school kids and sports activities. If you leave the windows closed, there is really not a major problem sleeping. Remember the primo location in a big city if the traffic noise is a problem. We do like to sleep with the windows open if possible which to be frank was tough some nights when the games would go on late. * The double bed was hard and too thin. Not a surprise in Europe, but not up to the standards of hotels in the US and other countries which are upgrading their in-room experience. * The bath tub looked like it had had some type of friction strips on the bottom at some point but I found it extremely slippery (my wife disagreed) and it is an area for improvement. Bottom Line: I have rated 4 only because my spouse complained about her sleep experience. A fairer rating would be 4.5.

It is true to say that there is a kindegarten and some sports pitches in the courtyard at the rear of the hotel but we did not find that the children who played there, for only a relatively short period each day, were excessively noisy and in fact as grandparents ourselves we thought it really quite pleasant to hear the sound of young children playing. Also, if the window was closed for air conditioning purposes, you could hardly hear them at all. So, we had a very pleasant 5 day break at the Atrium Palace.

The reviews which I read on Trip Advisor warned us of the noisy schoolyard in the back of the hotel. When we arrived, the front desk clerk said they didn't have one available at that moment but we were told that they would have one available within the hour if we'd like to wait maybe in their small coffee shop. We checked back with the front desk clerk about a half-hour later and were told then that they did have one room left but had given it to another guest. Since were were exhausted from our trip, we opted to take our chances with a room in the back of the hotel. Unfortunately, it was just as the review stated! It was so noisy & excessively loud even though the windows were tightly closed! Every morning and afternoon, school kids were out playing in the courtyard and the noise was unbearable. Now we can tolerate some noise, but this was absolutely ridiculously loud! After traveling across the Atlantic on a 9 hour flight, having jet lag and wanting to catch a nap as well as wanting to sleep in the next morning until at least 9 am, who in their right minds want to listen to a lot of kids yelling and screaming? We were very disappointed with the hotel staff not wanting to accomodate us, esp. since we had notified them of our requests before our trip and expected that we'd have a room after being promised one when we arrived. Although the hotel was in a very desirable neighborhood with close proximity to great shopping and restaurants as well as their location being within walking distance to Playa Catalanya and Las Ramblas, I most definitely will plan on staying someplace else on our next trip to Barcelona. Their little cafe was adequate but there's a very limited menu and they're only open in the morning and for a few hours in the afternoon. The breakfast buffet, I must say, was phenomenal and that's held just off the cafe. I must say though, the food was great as was the service. the hotel staff were very friendly and although we did have problems in getting the room we requested, they did give us vouchers for a free breakfast everyday for both my husband and I. I just wish we could have had a better room that was in a less noisy area of the hotel so we didn't feel so tired everyday of our stay!

The hop on hop off bus leaves from the same square and a great way to see the city if you dont want to walk to much which was great for me as a 7 month pregnant women!!

I was recommended this hotel to stay in and i would recommend it to anyone else, it is so central, its great when they say everything within walking distance they mean it which more than likely isnt the case when you get there.

I was in Barcelona for business. I would rate this as a very good 3 star hotel. My room was very good. Lovely bathroom, balcony, flat screen TV. Bed was too hard for me - poor mattress - which lead to an uncomfortable sleep. There is a very small pool and jacuzzi in the basement. There's a gym too but the room temperature was way too hot for me to use. Anyway there was so much walking to do around Bracelona that I just didnt get out the gym gear. The hotel is on a very busy major road in Barcelona but the windows keep out the noise well so you dont really notice this. The hotel is within walking distance of most things in the centre of Barcelona if you are reasonably fit. Free wi-fi was great. The reception staff are mixed. There was one excellent guy who was born in Scotland who couldn't have been more helpful. Then one day I had the rude female recepetionist that I think others have referred to. Almost made me laugh, she was so outrageously rude! Breakfast is typical of a Spanish hotel. A buffet of mixed food. Beware the taxis in Barcelona - there are a minority of taxi drivers who will do the usual drive round the houses to put up the fare. The worst thing about the taxis is that if you order one from the hotel you will find a surcharge of up to 4.50 Euros added as it was called by phone. This surcharge is shared with the hotel. Rip off. They will also charge you more if you have luggage (why?) and if you are going to the airport and if it is a week-end.... My return jourmey to the airport was charged at 50 Euros!!! A simple and loud protest and a glance at a nearby polieman dropped the charge immediately to 30!! So - get your taxi form the street outside and not via the hotel (great service from the hotel eh?!) and make sure you know how much to expect to pay and the rough journey via a map before your get in.

We arrived hotel after our amazing European cruise visiting Italy, France and Malta. We arrived at 8:30 and Rafael at the front desk was really pleasant and friendly. He told us that the room was not ready which I completly understood he told us that the room will be ready by 12pm. We walked around the Ramblas and frankly I think it is way overrated, way to expensive to eat and shop, go else where for shop and eat, Try The Cortes Ingles restaurants on Plaza de Catalunya the prices are good and the quality is excellent. (On Sundays most of all Barcelona shuts down, shops, supermarkets, ect) Well. going back to the hotel, we went back at 12pm and was assigned room 307 on the 3rd floor, the two elevators are small and hot. The room was ok , there where laminated floors that was installed really sloppy, the moldings around the floors where falling off and not well put together. The bathroom door paneling was peeling off the door and also the bathtub was really slippery and also there was rust building around the parimeters of the tub. The pool and jacuzzi were closed for renovations. Dont let the pool fool you its is really small. Also the beds are awful, the springs where stabing me for 2 nights in a row. Ouch!!! They really need to update their beds. I dont think this hotel deserves a 4 star rating to be honest. Oh by the way room 307 was facing the school yard and that did not bother us at all since the windows are double pane. I think that Apsis Atrium Palace tries but dont deliver.

The other hotel's listed price was higher, but the Apsis Atrium ended up being more expensive and it was a much less pleasant stay. First, I booked directly through the hotel's website and requested a room for three (my wife and I were travelling with an 18 year old daughter). We stopped by the hotel 2 nights before we checked in and found out we had a room for two booked, with no room for a cot. They moved us to a larger room at \"no additional cost,\" but an additional 60 euro/night charge for the cot. Upon check in, everything seemed fine. The room was indeed adequate for the three of us. However, there is a school next to the hotel and we were awakened at 7am by hoards of youngsters playing in the schoolyard. It was impossible to sleep beyond 7am. That was ok with me, but not my 18 year old. Also, the walls do not appear to be any impediment to noise. I'm used to hearing my neighbors if they are talking as they leave the room next door. In this hotel I could clearly hear people talking from several rooms away, even from other floor levels. I travel a lot and have never stayed in a hotel with such poor acoustics. The flooring in our room was very cheap linoleum that was warping up in several areas. On the positive side, the location is excellent. Easy access to shopping and reasonable walking distance to several tourist sites. Two blocks to a metro stop. Four blocks to the airport bus at Plaza Catalunya (3 euro into the city, 4 euro back to the airport).. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean. The bathrooms were very nice. At checkout I was charged 25 euros for the few calls we made (I only used the phone three times to make dinner reservations, call a friend and once to check on the hours of Park Guell-probably 9 times total). At the other hotel we used there was no charge for local calls from the room. When it was all added up, I paid more per night for this hotel than the other, \"more expensive\" hotel.

In the morning the evening after arriving, went to hotel-restaurant where breakfast was served between 7.15-10.30. We arrived in the restaurant at 10.15.The waiter greeted us by looking irritated and looking at his watch. He then informed us after asking for our room-number that breakfast was not included in our rate. When we disagreed, the waiter very briskly told us we had to step up to the front desk to sort things out, with about 10 minutes left of breafkast. He followed us there and consulted another staff-member, who searched for a transcript of our Internet-reservation, without finding it. A third employee in a more senior position was then involved in the \"case\", and quickly found our transcript only to see that breakfast indeed was included. We then went back to the restaurant in order to have breakfastand given there were now only a few minutes left of it, since the time now was betwen 10.20 and 10.25, sat down right next to the buffet. A waiter, not the same as before, then came rushing up to our table and declared that we were not allowed to sit there. He pointed at the far end end of the restaurant, which incidentally was as far away as possible from the buffet. We then felt we had had enough and decided to go to our room and order breakfast . This was probably just before 10.30. What was sent to our room was two small pieces of bread- rolls and one cup of coffe and one cup of tea, butter and marmalade and some dry croissants, far in quality from the buffet served at the restaurant.The two glasses of orange juice on our tray seemed to have been diluted beyond recognition. We then called and asked for some more bread-rolls, some more orange juice for both of us, coffee and tea. We received a new tray with one glass of orange-juice and one coffee. I then called again to ask about the bread-rolls and the tea only to be told that the hotel now had to charge extra for this since it was now after 10.30. I tried to explain the situation, but the woman at the reception was very firm and refused to send us anything free of charge. When we booked the room the information on the hotel web-page stated that either breakfast.buffet or breakfast in the room was included. The breakfast served in your room would be a continental one, but I thought that even as a such the breakfast we got up to our room was a very poor one.The hotel then charged extra for the coffee and the one glass of juice(as promised) when we checked out. Other \"amenities\" at the hotel included a business corner with two computers, but it seemed they had never heard of the fact that mouses need to get cleaned every once in a while in order to work, because one mouse was so full of dirt that it was useless to click with. We stayed in two different rooms, and they both had such thin walls that we could hear our neighbour going to the bathroom, or throwing up, which we had the \"pleasure\"of doing during one night. When somebody flushed it sounded like the ceiling was coming down. The drains in the shower and the sink did not work very good,so after taking a shower the tub was flooded with dirty drainage-water.The water-pressure in the shower was very weak for a four-star hotel. I also found old dental floss on the floor in the bath-room. Our room was extremely hot, and when I called reception about it I was told that they did not have the air-condition on,only heating in the winter. I felt to fed up to then ask why there in that case was a thermostat in the room, and if I lowered it, should not the room then get cooler(I tried that but it did not work,I lovered it to only 10 degrees centigrade, but the room was still as hot as before). We did get to switch rooms because of the heating, and were then asked to bring our bath-robes along to the new room, and also at first to come down to the reception to get the new key, but instants later the reception called us again and told us that they were of course giong to send a porter up with the key and also to help us with the luggage. The hotel also uses a system, where you get four small bottles of water for free, and this is all you will find in the mini-bar when arriving. Everything else that you might want i.e juice,beer,wine,soda you have to order up to you room and pay for , not only pay for what you drink from the mini-bar. We decided we wanted to settle the bill the evening before leaving, since we were leaving early in the morning. When my fiance went down to pay the bill, the receptionist refused to assist him, stating that he could indeed do that in the morning instead. My fiance then really had to argue to get to settle the bill the night before leaving, saying that we wanted to pay now because we were leaving early and wanted to minimize the strees of this. So then after much discussion he did get to pay. The next morning, we went up to the reception to leave our keys and the words of farewell from the receptionist was not\"bye,hope you have enjoyed you stay\" or something of the like, but\"DID YOU PAY???\".", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria - San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cSatisfactory But Not Worth The Rate...\u201d", "Author": "SilverRRCloud", "ReviewID": "UR10917704", "Content": "We were quickly offered #602, spacious, comfortable with a decent view and low noise.

Since the room price of Gallery hotel is quite high at this moment, we were very happy to book the room at Apsis Atrium Palace.

On one hand, I think in Spain general this is an average 4 star hotel, but on the other hand, this is a hotel in Barcelona, consider the excellent location, the very reasonable room price and the helpful personnel, I think Apsis Atrium Palace definitely deserves to have a rating of 4 (above average). Our preference was a twin room, for some misunderstanding firstly we were offered a room on the first floor which was a room with a double bed plus a single bed and had no view at all. Fortunately we could change to a room on the 5th floor. It was very well maintained and perfectly clean. It is very comfortable to have slippers and bathrobes in room. The bathroom amenities are indeed quite extensive. Only we didn\u2019t see the body milk as mentioned in the website. If I knew, I would bring my own. The air conditioning was working very well. The first two nights were nice and quiet. The third night (Friday night) was noisier. But this happens frequently in Spanish hotels. The sound insulation is often an issue. Since last year we always bring the silicone ear plugs with us when traveling, which works perfect. As every traveler agreed, the location of Apsis Atrium Palace is just perfect. Most attractions are in walking distance and all the public transportation stops close by. We bought two T-10 cards which give us 20 times travel within 1 zone by all kind of public transportation (bus, metro etc.) which was very convenient.

Found the hotel from searching on google for hotels in City Centre locations. This Hotel says it is a 4* and I believe it is. Exterior is traditional but they have ripped out the interior and made it into a boutique hotel, with lots of wooden floors and panels. The main stairs in reception are still authentic. The reception staff were very helpful and advice on where to eat and what to do was very welcome. The hotel had a special offer if booking for 3 days or more you could have a buffet breakfast for 1/2 price, which for us was \u20ac8 per person per day instead of \u20ac16. Well worth it, self service for everything from Tea/Coffee to full cooked breakfast. Plenty of choice of fresh fruits and the usual pastries etc. Our room was a good size. We were at the back of the hotel in a double bed, with a sitting/changing area. We overlooked the school which could be noisy at break times and early evening when playing football or basketball tournaments, however we went to Barcelona for the sights not just the hotel. The only draw back, there was no tea/coffee facilities in the room. Mini bar had a good choice at a reasonable cost, however still and sparkling water were free and replaced daily. Safe deposit box in room was also free. Bathroom suited us fine, with good size bathrobes and slippers, and everything you would need for a short break in the way of toiletries, including toothbrushes, and wet shave equipment.

We stayed here for 4 nights from 28/2/2007 and have just returned home tonight. The rooms were clean and there was some decent bedding although the quilt smelt of aftershave which I found a bit too close to the previous occupant. We were given a room on the first floor. This may have been a family room as it had a bed settee. I was disappointed that we had a 'view 'of an air duct / conditioning pipe and a wall close opposite. Why do I always seem to get this so predictable? The hotel was very quiet and I cant believe there was nothing with a better view!! The pool is a very small plastic form type which for the hotel was disappointing as if you were going to build a pool you would build somthing better in your back garden. They missed an opportunity when building the hotel to do something much much better. The pictures on the net appear quite grand but it was not. The pool did have some atmospheric lighting and would change colour when this was switched on around day 3 but felt full with 5 adults and in the summer this would be an issue. When we first arrived the jaccuci was out of service which was disappointing but came into service after a day or so. The sauna was readily switched on when we asked for it to be but the sauna bucket was completely useless with holes in it and water literally flowed through the gaps and I got the floor swamped trying to introduce some water / steam. Breakfasts were okay with lots of fresh fruit. The kitchen appeared very clean and appeared to be subject to regular inspection by the management on a daily basis. The staff were nice and friendly. I would stay here again but if I had the choice would choose a hotel with a better pool and a room with a view. I have to say the biggest down side for me is the fact that the soundinsulation in the rooms was an issue. When someone flushed their toilet it sounded like the contents were rushing down the downpipe which sounded like it was in the wall near my bed. This was very very off putting. Also there was from time to time no doubt about the fact that someone was using their bathroom. I dont know if this had something to do with the fact that our room on the first floor was at the bottom of the hotel ( no pun intended) but avoid first floor if you find this off putting. You can hear the school kids which was not a problem but shame about the lack of a view of any kind. If you have kids try The Mafia restaurant on the walking route to the Ramblas. Nice and child friendly. Also Port Olympic was the best beach we found and there are nice restaurants. Take the tourist bus if you want to avoid a long walk. Everyone warns you about pick pockets in Barcelona. I have never seen so many people on the street ( i live in London) and there are many police about so you should be okay but dont put your bag down or I suspect you will lose it!!", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wicklow, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel - Great Location\u201d", "Author": "tonybyrne81", "ReviewID": "UR6840705", "Content": "My girlfriend and I recently returned from a 3 night stay at the Atrium Palace and overall we enjoyed a pleasant say.

It got loud around 8:30-9AM - depending on what you did the night before, that could be early!! 2. noise in general. We could hear everything in the hallway. Because of the hardwood floors, sometimes we heard, for example, a chair being dragged across the floor from the room above us. 3. Bathroom ammenities... The shampoo and body wash (I thought) were not up to a 4 star standard. Of course they did the trick, but they were not luxurious by any means. Also, there was no lotion! 4. the Whirlpool in the spa was broken while we were there. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel - it seemed a little pricey to us at 16 Euro per person. There are plenty of places to eat around the corner for much cheaper. None of those things disrupted our stay in any way. The location of the hotel makes getting anywhere in Barcelona extremely easy.

We checked in around 12 and were asked to come back around 3 PM. Already when we entered the lobby we were getting the impression that something is not working as it should, the rug was stained, there were crumbs in the elevator and the impression was not very good. When we came back we were offered rooms 610 and 611 in the 6th floor, but when we entered the rooms a very strong smell of smoke hit us combined with dirt on the floor dust on the furniture and hair on the blankets, immediately we asked for cleaner and no smoking rooms, although the hotel was full the receptionist was very kind and moved us after an hour we had to wait to 2 not connected rooms in the 3rd floor (the rooms were much cleaner and smelled from massive use of air freshener so we assumed they re-cleaned them) apologizing and promising that on the following day we will have the non smoking connected rooms. This was sufficient and as promised we were moved on the next day to two connected rooms in the same (3rd) floor. Still I must also add that on the second day when we went to the SPA in the evening (very very small and cold) we noticed and killed cockroach in the swimming pool and I am sure you can still find it under the wooden floor near the oval window To summarize the four nights we stayed there I will say that - The staff is supporting the location is good and the deal for the breakfast is very nice. BUT we can not ignore the poor maintenance level (why they do not clean the elevators more often? Why there are all these black signs that the luggage left on all the walls inside and outside the rooms? Why they do not clean the mini-bars from leftovers of other guests and dirt?).

The restaurant served a good breakfast, although I'm glad we booked for bed & breakfast, I feel the cost of 16Euros per day per person was a little excessive. We chose not to eat in the restaurant beyond breakfast, as it was a little too clinical, almost like a canteen, rather an atmospheric dining experience. The room we had was lovely, air conditioned, cleaned daily and stylishly decorated, containing a double bed (at my request) which was firm and comfortable. Our only minor niggles were, (i) the view from our room - they knew it was our honeymoon, yet we looked out on air conditioning ventilation ducts and the back end of another building, and (ii) they offered no exchange service - meaning one evening when I approached to cash some travellers cheques, they wouldn't, subsequently leaving us short of money for the evening.

Bathrobe & slippers provided too. Safe in room. Pool is very small however satisfies for a quick dip. Nice jacuzzi & sauna. Fitness room is pretty poorly equiped so better to go out for a run to the beach!

Naturally, there is some noise at the back of the hotel as there is a primary school playground out the back however the little'uns are only out there playing during the week after 9am anyway so don't see what the issue is with that!? Location - very central & ideally located for sightseeing & shopping - no need for taxis in evenings, etc as within walking distance to cool bars/restaurants. Located just off Passeig Gracia up from Placa Catalunya. Las Ramblas is a 10 min stroll down the road. Eating/Drinking - excellent Tapas Bar nearby is Txapela - this is located on Gracia. Always bustling full of locals. Good pizza @ Veronica's. Anima off C/Carme serves excellent med/asian fusion type food. There are also a number of funky bars around Carme as well as more restaurants. Best bar for Mojitos has to be all time favourite 'Boadas Cocktails' situated just on the corner of the first right hand turn off Las Ramblas- it is very smoky inside but worth it for the experience! Shopping - There's a massive Zara on the corner of Gracia/Cortes Catalanes. Most of the big name desingers can be found further up Gracia (Loewe, Gucci, Chanel, LV, Stella Macartney, etc) Would recommend exploring maze of streets to the left of the Ramblas around the Gothic quarter & near Cathedral as there are some funky little boutiques to be found. Didn't actually eat in hotel as don't see the point when there's so many places to eat out for breakfast, lunch & dinner.. Barcelona is a placed to be explored rather than sitting in your hotel!

The rooms were great, modern and clean. The extra touches such as the free water and soft drinks, bathrobes and slippers made my stay even better. The bathrooms were very nice too, spacious and chic all in marble, with an excellent power shower. Hotel location could not be better. Me and my partner had a balcony room on the 4th floor, balcony rooms are smaller however the size of the room was more than ample. Our room was right at the front of the hotel and our balcony was out on the main road which was extremely busy however once the balcony doors were shut the noise was blocked out! Our air conditioning was excellent, infact one morning i woke up that cold i had to turn it down, very good considering it was the middle of july and about 32 degrees outside! So if there were problems with this as previous reviewers have mentioned it has been rectified! What can i say about the basement floor other that brilliant! the pool, although small was very refreshing and looked great as lights were underneath the pool (these changed colour creating a relaxing and luxurious atmosphere) the jacuzzi was great and as it was open from 7am-midnight i definately recomment that you experience it! Although i did not use the sauna and gym they looked very nice. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We did not stay in the hotel restaraunt as i thought it to be a little overpriced so i cannot comment however it looked nice. You are spoilt for choice for restaraunts in barcelona, if you are unsure where to go the hotel provides an excellent book in your room which gives you info on all the restaraunts as well as places of interest. All in all i had an excellent holiday and this hotel was a major factor in this. i would definately stay again!", "Date": "July 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSo good we're going back soon\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2208968", "Content": "Didn't know where to stay in Barcelona so found this site and went with the recomendations. Stayed here for a long weekend June 2004 to celebrate wifes' birthday. Hotel was outstanding and staff so helpful, even supplied a complementary bottle of fiz. Reception were always willing to give great suggestions for places to eat (if you like fish you are in for a real treat!!!). Shops, including designer names if you want, all within 2-5 minutes walk. Oh! and \"La Rambas\" about 5 mins walk (don't miss it if you like street entertainers). Only draw back was indoor pool, more like a big bath!!! Still, am going back their soon.
