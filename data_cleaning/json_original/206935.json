Also had a beef stew in the afternoon and it was delishes. My advise is eat the food in the hotel cause the food in the city is usually rubbish. - Barca TV, as one of our must do in Barcelona was to go and see the match having Barca TV was cool, unfortunately it was in Spanish or Catalan so we couldn't understand anything. - Air Conditioning - it was boiling hot in Barcelona, good thing to have in such heat. Negatives - One of the elevators doesn't work, and the one working is very slow to arrive (we used stairs most of the time from 3rd floor). - Rooms, we booked two rooms (301 and 302), they were small for a 4 star hotel, and what i couldnt' believe in was that in the bathroom (which also is not a 4 star hotel standard) there was a window and when i opened it and my mate opened the window in his bathroom we could see each other... that is just obscene. Also the double beds weren't actually double beds just two single beds put together, and one of the wheels on my bed was missing so when i moved to the side of the bed the whole bed moved with me. - TV, NOT A SINGLE CHANNEL IN ENGLISH or any other language! - Staff (Bartenders, Waiters) - they did not have any English! how are you supposed to communicate with them. Also the staff was unfriedly, but i guess all spanish/catalan are the same. We spent 5 days in Barcelona and we didnt meet many friendly people. - Price, we paid 110 euros per night, it's so not worth the money.

We did not eat there but the restaurant/bar looked nice. The mirrored elevators were small (by American standards, but not European). Our room on the 7th floor was the largest we had in Europe, and seemed to be a standard unit. There was a large marble-lined bathroom, new fixtures and large mirror. The room was spacious with two full-size beds, which were very comfortable. There is slightly wider sitting area at the window, with a large closet with safe an mini-bar. The TV was flat panel, maybe 40 inches, but ALL CHANNNELS were in Spanish or Catalan (no British or American channels), and NO English subtitles. Also, the TV was by the window, so you have to look sideways from the bed to see it, otherwise you are facing a bare white wall.

In my view, it's really nice. Our room (602) was again clean and sleek. The bathroom is well fitted with very modern white ceramic fittings. The floor is green marble and the walls are all cream ceramic tiles. One reviewer has posted a photo of a load of horrible looking pipes. Well, in our bathroom, there was a very tidy opaque glass UPVC window which was on an internal wall. Curiosity got the better of me and I opened it. Therein I found said horrible looking pipes. I found that not opening this little internal window again was a very effective method of not seeing the pipes!! We were lucky with the view I guess - we were on the front of the hotel and looked out at the gorgeous buildings on Via Augusta. Yes, you can hear the traffic outside but it did not prevent me from sleeping and I would not describe it as excessively noisy. Last thing. There is a wellness centre on the top floor. There is a sun terrace with loungers, and a few CV machines. There's also a Sauna. The terrace is a very well appointed space if you want to soak up the sun. I have paid about \u20ac90 per night here and I think it's really good value.

My opinion of the hotel did not improve from the last time I was there. They put us in a room at the back where there was not enough room to move around. Also the bathroom was too small and poorly lighted for a 4 star. The hotel is completely without charater and you would hesitate to sit and chill in reception which looks nothing like a hotel reception more like an office reception.

What I was most annoyed with was the blase attitude of some of the staff. Depending on who was at the desk, service or questions about the city could be like a trip to the dentist. They did not go out of the way to offer advice. Also, don't look for restaurants near the hotel. Most better places are located in more lively parts of town.

We found the metro cheap, efficient and easy - Diagonal being the closest to the hotel. Reception staff were friendly and helpful when approached but seemed reluctant to look up from their computers to pass the time of day - a greeting and a smile makes a big difference. The rooms were kept spotless with clean sheets and towels every day - full marks to the cleaning staff. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel because of the comments made in previous reviews - there are lots of lovely cafes within easy walking distance at half the price.
