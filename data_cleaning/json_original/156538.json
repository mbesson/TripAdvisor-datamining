It was a fabulous experience. The hotel is perfectly located within a few minutes walking distance to the Vancouver Convention Center and the harbour. There are plenty of beautiful shops and restaurants around. The house is very special and tastefully decorated with lots of stylish art works on all floors. We had booked a Standard room, which was well equipped and absolutely spacious enough for us two. The bathroom was a bit small but impeccable clean. It had everything you need. There are bigger rooms available for higher room rates. We got high speed internet connection in the room both via cable or WLAN. Fortunately we could switch off the air condition and sleep with an open window. (Don't know what air condition is good for in Canada...). The staff is extremely friendly and willing to help with anything you need. They found a solution for whatever special wishes we had. My wife does not like to use elevators. That was no problem at all: The hotel opened the fire stairs for us and gave us a room on second floor. Breakfast is not included, but you get the best Muesli out of Switzerland in the attached O'Doule's restaurant which will probably be one of the best restaurants in town. Every single meal was gorgeous, and on Saturday evening there is live Jazz music (which you will NOT hear in your sleeping room!). The bar in the restaurant is also a great place for drinks and meeting people. We can strongly recommend this house for everyone who looks for a very individual hotel that makes a difference to the boring sleeping boxes of the big hotel chains. Nothing to complain? Actually no.

For those who would like to jog or stroll along Cole Harbour and admire the breathtaking view, it is a mere 5-minute walk away. Don't miss Cafe Villagio in front of the harbour. The service is friendly, the views unmatched, and the cinammon rolls absolutely delicious. Quite close also is world-renowned Stanley Park.

I've seen many people here complaining about the cost of parking, taxes, etc...be aware before you travel to Vancouver that this is unavoidable. As a large, busy city, parking costs $$ everywhere you go...from restaurants to shopping to sight-seeing. The Listel does charge $26 per night for valet parking (with tax comes out to about $35 USD), which is quite pricey. However, the only alternative is trying to find a meter somewhere on Robson (good luck) or surrounding streets and then walk in everyday. As Vancouver was a very unfamiliar city to us (in an unfamiliar country, for that matter), we chose just to suck it up and accept the cost as a part of our travel budget. We were, however, expecting the cost because of the reviews here, as the hotel otherwise doesn't make it very obvious until you check in. Parking is a trade-off for the location, which is hands-down the best thing about this hotel. Located right in the middle of Robson, one of Vancouver's busiest shopping streets, you are pretty much in walking distance from lots of fun things to do, great restaurants, shops, etc. I've heard some refer to it as the \"Rodeo Drive\" of Vancouver...I wouldn't go that far, but it does have a lot of shopping options, not to mention the Vancouver ArtGallery just a few blocks up. If you don't care as much about being right smack-dab in the middle of all the city action, consider staying out of downtown, maybe in Kitsilano or West Vancouver and you may find better parking rates. As for the hotel itself...eh. My husband and I have stayed in a lot of hotels, and our biggest complaint was that this hotel was just \"okay\" for having a 4-star rating. Our first night, we stayed in a room on the second-floor, on the backside of the property. Not terrible, but not great either...just an average room. The bed was very firm, uncomfortable and \"springy\" which I did not enjoy at all. The next night, we decided to upgrade to the \"gallery floor\" for an extra $20 per night. Not too much change here (just bathrobes, free french-press coffee in the mornings, a bigger TV, and a \"media bar\" that you can use to plug in your iPad, etc), but the bed was much nicer, and that alone was worth the cost. Staff was ok. The housekeepers were great, very friendly and prompt with cleaning our room while we were gone during the day. The front desk staff was just alright. There was one employee (whose name escapes me) who perhaps was the valet as he was almost always the one to get our car, but he always asked if we needed directions or suggestions, and he was very friendly and approachable when we had questions about what to do. Again, can't remember his name, but I do know that he was originally from Amsterdam, and very helpful to us during our stay. All in all, I would only recommend this hotel if you get a tremendous deal (under $100 per night). And don't forget to budget in the tax and the parking, as that will be a considerable expense.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, lovely artwork and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "Capt_tuBBymAN", "ReviewID": "UR126106933", "Content": "The Listel was an excellent hotel as a base for our 3 day visit to Vancouver.

We always have a comfortable and pleasant stay. The service at both the Listel and the restaurant downstairs, O'Doul's, has been consistently above par in our stays here. During the Olympics when we were in town (we stayed elsewhere, however, due to Olympic committees booking 90% of the existing hotel rooms in the city) we had a few drinks in O'Doul's to watch the Canada/Russia game, and the restaurant manager wandered by and gave us tickets to a medal ceremony for no apparent reason. The property is conveniently located on entertaining Robson street which is chock full of restaurants and shopping; we are big hockey fans and previously enjoyed the large sports bar across the street but on our last trip we sadly noticed it has been replaced by a Greek restaurant, which for most people will probably be a nice upgrade. O'Doul's offers a very tasty breakfast and, apparently, live music most weekend nights. I wouldn't know because there are so many great restaurants in the area at which to eat at that I never have had dinner there. I can particularly recommend Joe Forte's on the corner of Thurlow and Robson which has a great rooftop dining area in the summers. Of course, the hotel has a bunch of art in the lobby gallery and scattered around the building. Although they make a point of saying the rooms are also appointed with local art, most guests probably wouldn't notice--the room art is really not that conspicuously different from any other hotel of this caliber. One or two pieces in a room is not enough to make a difference. It does make the lobby more engaging, however. The Listel is appropriately, possibly even well, priced. It is an elegant, quiet but not stodgy hotel. We are a young childless couple ourselves, so I never really noticed, but thinking back on it now I realize we haven't come across any families here.

The furniture was in good condition and the bed was extremely comfortable. The windows were large, allowing lots of natural light in, and the air conditioner worked well (almost too well!).

Adding value to a hotel is difficult once you have got a comfortable bed, plenty of pillows, a decent TV and double shower curtains in every room. If you go down the boutique route, which is what the Listel has done, then you buy in a lot of poncey statuary, hang a lot of poncey limited edition prints on the walls, put in some arty chairs that are as comfortable as a park bench, put the curtains (inexplicably) on the outside of the nets and call yourself a museum. You redesign the lobby so it doesn't look like a hotel and leave your staff wondering whether you want them to be friendly or aloof. You put a small mini-mart in each room (including a hotel branded bottle of chocolate sauce branded as a Romance Kit for $22.95 not including taxes). After all, you can charge over the odds for everything because they are staying in a 'museum' and you have got to pay for that artwork somehow. Internet access is a good example. You can't use the WiFi because, thanks to the condominiums that surround the hotel, there are literally one hundred wireless networks competing for the bandwidth. You have got more chance of getting a signal from SETI than you have from the hotel WiFi. You can borrow an Ethernet cable from Reception at which point your speed will go up from 0.12Mbps to 2.14Mbps but you have to put down a deposit of $20 for the cable, which is my point. Why $20? Why not $50 or $5 (which would be the cost of replacing the cable)? Everything has been priced just below the level at which you would refuse to pay and well above the level that it ceases to be good value. Now you might say that it is refundable and set at that level to remind you to give it back, which is fair enough, to which I would retort \"Have you ever tried to plug an Ethernet cable into your iPhone or iPad?\" I know parking in cities is a problem. In London most people don't keep a car and use public transport. If you are on a holiday where you have just driven half-way across Canada in a car you don't have much choice. Parking at the the hotel for two days cost $70, once you have included tax (nothing is ever quoted inclusive of tax, as a rule of thumb it adds 20% to everything). This is just below the point at which you might park your car somewhere else and the hotel reserves the right to park your car somewhere else for you, including on the street. When you arrive they tell you your car will be in secure parking, then when they give you the ticket it says that it is not guaranteed to be secure, it might be parked on the street, it might get damaged and you give up all rights to sue them for their negligence and lack of duty of care and no employee of theirs in the world has any authority to say anything different. Notices of this kind (excluding liability for negligence or lack of duty of care) are not legal where I come from. If you are reading this and you are from the hotel, then I hereby absolve myself from negligence in writing this review under the laws of British Columbia. How do you like that? You can stay in this hotel despite all of the above. It is in a good area to explore Vancouver. It is reasonably quiet before 8am (we were on the back). There is a nice Italian restaurant (Zefferelli's) a hundred yards up the road. The staff are friendly and you can pick up and drop off your car as often as you like, but there is something about the whole city rip-off experience that is profoundly depressing.

The AC worked, but was very loud and took a while to cool off. They also placed us on the second floor, right next to the elevator and we experienced a bit of noise. We also had a terrible non-view - overlooking windows and rooftop from the restaurant. A shame as if we would have been one floor up we would have seen the mountains. I also have to say, there was NO artwork in the room that made it stand out. Just a couple framed pictures of boats or something, I can't even remember. Price wise we were happy we got to stay the extra night in Vancouver. We were in walking distance to downtown and gastown (for us... maybe not for all) and Robson Street certainly had lots to offer. We took advantage of the free shuttle to Grouse Mountain and ate some pretty fantastic meals (Vij's is definitely worth the cab ride and the wait). I'm not going to say we didn't have a great time, because we really did. The staff and location were first rate. All in all, I just felt a little let deceived by the hotel website and also Jetsetter. Both really sold the property up to be something different and great.

Central Vancouver is very compact and we were able to walk from the hotel to downtown in about 15 minutes, Stanley Park in about 20 minutes and a similar distance west to Sunset Beach and the water taxi across to Granville Island. Getting from the airport to the hotel is easy enough - just catch the Sky Train Canada Line to the Cty Centre station on Granville Street, which takes about half an hour.

Another evening was spent at the Orpheum Theater listening to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra perform with the talented Natalie MacMaster.

First, the positives: .Friendly, helpful, efficient front desk .Central (though not particularly attractive) location .they tried with the furniture (though the wood is scratched and weary) .screened prints with indigenous designs .extra-deep tub .decent towels .wine in the lobby for an hour in the evening .cool concept .quiet hallway .attempt at being green .free (but slow) wifi .free phone calls to states Now, the rest: .after reading the reviews here and in trip advisor I felt shocked when I arrived at a broken down looking 1980's hotel with what appears to be public housing in the back. .booked a room on the museum floor and can't imagine what they mean by museum aside from a couple of indigenous-themed screened prints. .closet door broken .no in-room safe .tv not flat-screened and no printed guide .view from our window of the back alley facing the projects .a wad of someone's already-chewed gum in the drawer .extra-hard bed that sags in the middle, like it's been used for the last 25 years - so bad that we wake up multiple times per night in pain. .not enough pillows and the ones we have are lumpy and under-filled .no continental (or any other kind) of breakfast .running toilet .shower head keeps falling off .worn out carpet .our whole room - and indeed, the whole hotel - feels TIRED and as if they took a broken-down hotel, gave it the barest whiff of a remodel, slapped on a concept, and called it a boutique hotel. It looks not even CLOSE to the pics on the travel sites. .though location is in walking distance to downtown, it's not particularly attractive and in spite of some decent shops it feels a bit seedy. In short, my husband and I booked this hotel for our 10th anniversary, thinking it would be special. We felt deeply disappointed as we arrived, because it's not even close to what we pictured and read about in the reviews. I'd say an appropriate price for our room would be about $80/night, and I wouldn't dream of staying here again unless I could get a room for about that much. As a comparison: the night before I arrived I stayed in a Best Western hotel in Seattle that was about the same vintage. However, we had an extra-large room, an extremely comfortable bed with wonderful linens and excellent pillows, four pillows per bed, flat-screen tv w/guide, full breakfast, everything in perfect working order -- and we paid half of what we paid for our room at the Listel.

It had a weird stench, like covered up smoking air freshener. Also there was not enough counter space in the bathroom. It was very noisy. You have the street noise, as well as the air conditioner noise. And I don't think it really matters what floor you are on. It's just a busy part of town with very loud air conditioners. We used the fitness center, which also had a weird stench to it. I can't get the stench out of my mind. And one of the elevators was out of service which was very annoying. There was not even a stairwell that we could use. I forgot to mention the terrible beds. They were so old. You could feel the springs on your back. And the bed skirt was falling off, and you could see just how old the mattress was. It looked pretty worn.

The hotel is located at the west end of Robson Street, before the descent into the Stanley Park area. Perfect location if you want to shop, easy walk to Pacific Centre, Coal Harbour, or English Bay. Also so many restaurants/bars etc, within walking distance, though some might consider it a bit far from the Granville entertainment district if you want that. We had a rate of $89 + tax, for a second floor room, which the hotel refers to as a \"standard floor room\". Check-in and valet were smooth, fairly quick. Room on small side with king and sofa, no mini-bar, which was odd as we were given a mini-bar key at check-in. I had called down to inquire as I was looking for a fridge, and was told I could have one delivered for $10/night for an equip. fee but this level of room didn't include a fridge, ok no problem. Level of furnishings and style were more than you'd expect for the rate we paid so I was pleasantly surprised, i.e. brand-new towels, wine glasses set out, quality coffee to make yourself. Can't comment on the restaurant or facilities such as the gym or Jacuzzi, didn't use them. Did order room service, it was professional and prompt. Our room faced the alley, and we were amazed both nights were extremely quiet, the hotel is well insulated and we didn't hear guests coming and going at all. My only complaint, the beds, they should be replaced, old and hard, but again to be expected for our rate. I didn't sleep well, but my husband had no issue. Likely the beds on the higher floors are more plush. When we checked out we were amazed by the amount of taxes, especially the BC transit tax on the parking (approx. 25%) so be aware, your end bill is much higher than the rate, no fault of the hotel, just a warning to travellers to Vancouver. The valet left us a surprise in our vehicle - cookies. Nice touch.

It was our go-to hotel in Vancouver because of it's reasonable rates, clean rooms, great location, good food and friendly service. Many of the staff there know us and we always looked forward to going back. Sadly, one front desk employee and a poor choice of artwork ruined it for us. My husband and I had just been through a stressful event and decided to head to Vancouver for a weekend away to regroup. This hotel prides itself on being art-focused and always has interesting work in the lobby area, sometimes very tasteless. On this occasion they had an exhibit of photography depicting men with hyenas, baboons and monkeys on chains, some of them holding sticks in threatening stances as if they were about to beat the animals. We read the posted synopsis of the artists work and were even more disturbed after reading that the men in the photographs often had \"brutal and cruel\" relationships with their animals. Now let me make the point that I fully understand that art does not have to be my taste to be good or worthy of appreciation. However, when I go to a hotel, I want to feel welcomed and relaxed, not offended and upset. I am a huge animal lover and since The Listel had become a sort of home away from home, being faced with huge depictions of animal cruelty was really disturbing. Upon checkout I mentioned this to the young man named Sebastian at the front desk. He proceeded to explain to us that \"good art is always thought-provoking\" and proudly told us how one guest had actually canceled their stay because she had been so offended by a piece they had displayed. He spoke to my husband and I as if we were children and it was his job to school us on art appreciation. If I want to be challenged or have a though-provoking art experience I will go to a gallery, thank you very much, but when I stay at a hotel I want to feel warm and fuzzy. My husband (who has a degree from a prestigious art school) and I (who worked at a Four Seasons hotel for years) were so flabbergasted we couldn't even speak. I am pretty sure this was a new employee since we'd never seen him before, so I asked for his name and the GM's card and we left. We are extremely busy people and I never take the time to write reviews, but even though it has now been months, I thought it was important that others hear about our experience.

FRONT DESK / VALET / MISC Check-in / Check-out - Fast and friendly. Valet- Not around when we arrived. We had to mention this to the front desk person who was checking us in. However, during the rest of our stay, they were very responsive. Valet Parking fee - $35 per day! Gulp. The desk clerk claims this is a very reasonable price for downtown Vancouver. I'm not an authority on this topic, but other reviews on this site suggests a lower price can be had. Restaurant - Didn't get a chance to eat there. It looked very nice though.. and appeared to be a great jazz club in the evening.

We had two rooms for the four of us and, although we asked for the same thing, our room was a corner room with a large balcony. My wife was thrilled with the view, directly in line with the gap between high rises so we could see the boats in the harbor. Until the sun set, it was also a great site for our evening hearts games. We were on what is called the Museum Floor and, unlike a previous reviewer, we were fascinated with th First Nations artwork from the Univ. of BC Museum of Anthropology and, indeed, led us to include the museum on our itinerary. We were a bit disappointed with the renowned Robsson Street shopping district, but not with the Listel's location right in the middle of town. Our afternoon walks always yielded interesting neighborhoods and people watching. Our one regret: we were always a bit too pooped to partake of the late evening jazz session in the adjacent O'Douls next time in Vancouver, we'll allow more time for an afternoon nap so we can do justice to the night time offerings..", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for central Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "saddlers88", "ReviewID": "UR74567504", "Content": "This is the ideal place to stay for a short stay in central Vancouver.

The art in this \"art hotel\" is fantastic when I was here. A very interesting photography exhibit. The downside of this place and why it only gets 4 out of 5 stars (I was tempted to give it a 3) is that is bills itself as a \"arty designer\" type hotel. You would expect this place to be decked out with fancy, modern decor. Other than the great art on the wall, this place is barely a 3 star hotel. Room furniture is average at best. The TV is circa 1996. The bathroom is from a mid-range apartment in 1989. The AC hums and the carpet hasn't been changed in some time.

I originally booked directly with the hotel ($146 Can) but Expedia came out with a fantastic deal ($89 US) for the first 3 nights so I booked that, and then the LIstel had its own sale in early December and I was able to rebook the nights I had booked directly with the hotel for Can $89 - at that price, this hotel is a steal. The location is very central - it's down the West End end of Robson Street - a six block walk from the Skytrain station and even with my case and after a day of travel, and in light drizzle, it was a cinch to find (and by the by, CONGRATS Vancouver, on the new Canada line - its awesome to be able to jump on a train at the airport and 25 minutes later be in the centre of town - for the grand total of $2.50 - amazing. Back when I lived here in the mid 90s, you had to choose between an expensive shuttle, or a time consuming and luggage unfriendly public bus. but i digress...). I was given a room on the 2nd floor (our first floor), room 209. The bed was too hard for my poor back but within an hour they had put a down topper-cover on the mattress and I was perfectly comfortable with that addition. They also emptied the mini-bar so I could put in my milk and yoghurt etc (I like to have cereal and fruit in my PJs without having to be presentable for room service staff early in the morning!). The room was a decent size, good sized desk and bureau, a chaise-lounge (which I used for my case, which I live out of when travelling), 4 table lamps (all with different and somewhat fiddly knobs or levers), and two spare outlets which I was able to find and access without too much difficulty (one under the desk, which is a bit of a pain) and one behind the easy chair. The bathroom had an ante-chamber, one side with the sink, and one side with a vanity. the bathroom had a deep 3/4 length bath (tricky to get into if you are, like me, a shortie), and lavatory. Shower was perfectly serviceable over the bath, but poor water pressure and the shower nob could not be altered to up the pressure if you like a water massage. Nice towels and flannels. One thing I loved was the wall-mounted dispensers for shampoo and condition and shower gel - SO much better for the environment and access than fiddly little bottles. I use my own hair products, so can't report on those, but the shower gel was citrus and really yummy. Same with the handwash by the sink. Also, a first, a proper recycling bin under the vanity for bottles etc. Fantastic idea. The staff were incredibly helpful and professional - and I admit that I am a bit of a challenge (the bed, the fridge, the need to access my safe deposit box twice in 2 hours because I was somewhat disorganised...) - they never blinked - kudos. One day I left my diamond stud earrings in a glass on the vanity (this is my invariable practice at hotels but I usually wear them: this morning I was out early walking, and decided not to wear them) - when I got back to my room at 3.30 they were gone and the glass was turned upside down: freak out. I rang the front desk, she rang housekeeping, and 10 minutes later the head housekeeper was handing them back - luckily the glass had not yet been put in the dishwasher. So my assumption that glasses are rinsed and put back in the room does not hold here - they are taken down to the kitchen for cleaning. That's good service. I asked for and was given a slightly later checkout on my last day (1pm instead of 12pm) and the option of paying $85 for a 6pm check out - but I left my bags with the front desk and my stuff in the safe, and went to the cinema instead to while away the hours til i had to be at the airport. It rained all week, and wandering around in the damp loses its appeal after a while! Room Service: I had breakfast delivered one morning; it was delivered promptly at the time requested and was still pretty much warm; the blueberry banana pancakes were delicious; the poached eggs were sad wee things, minus most of their whites and overcooked. I had a momentary issue with the bill: the menu clearly states that the bill includes an 18% gratuity and a room service fee (standard) but the bill when it arrives, had a huge space for 'gratuity' in the middle of the bill, and it took me 60 seconds to ascertain that in fact the menu-stated gratuity WAS in fact included already: why do they do that? Why do you have to be made to feel cheap when you don't add on an extra tip to what is already a very generous included tip? So, things I didn't love: Internet: the hotel has both wired and ethernet and it is promoted as high speed. It is the slowest high-speed internet I have ever experienced. At home (Melbourne), I can download a TV episode on itunes in 12 minutes. At my hotel in LA it took 2 hours. Here it took about 14 hours to download an episode!! I borrowed an ethernet cable to see if that would speed things up, but no luck. It's incredibly slow. Room: Noise and Smells. I can't comment on whether these problems are endemic or relate only to rooms on the standard floor, but I would not choose to stay in my room again for these two reasons. The aircon was on when I moved in, and I immediately turned it off and opened the small window above the main window in my room. What this meant was that at night after the ambient noise died down, there was an almighty racket coming via the air con ducts in the room and the bathroom; it sounded like a toilet 'running' all night long - I am guessing it is the echo of the air con operating elsewhere in the hotel. I have never heard it before and its incredibly noisy. The only way I could sleep was with my foam earplugs, which I carry for plane trips. The other issue was an intermittent and somewhat unpleasant invasion of my room of cooking smells - I am not sure if these aromas came from the air con vent or from the restaurant which my room window overlooks - but it was weird and not very pleasant. The only other issue I had was lighting: it rained all week so outside was grey and dim. The lighting in the room is via table lamps - there is one behind the Chaise lounge, one on the desk and one of each of the bedside tables. Even with all of these turned on, the room is dim. At night this is not really a problem, but in the day time when you are trying to get motivated to get up and get going, its a problem! The problem in the bathroom was of a different nature - there is a light over the sink and one over the vanity, and one in the bathroom - nice and bright BUT incredibly fiddly; a total of 5 switches need to be played with and turned off before you head out; it seems like overkill - surely a maximum of 2 is all that is needed? Overall: for the price I paid, I thought this hotel was good value - comfortable, stylish, great staff, and an excellent location. However, I would not choose to stay in a standard room again so whether I would stay here a second time would depend on the cost of the next grade up.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast n.i", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "gadds", "ReviewID": "UR53448284", "Content": "stayed here for 5 nights last year, after arriving fron n. ireland 24 hours on the go we were met by very nice staff. rooms were very clean and food first class . the desk staff were really helpfull and nothing was any trouble,also a great location.iam a fussy traveler and like the hotel to be good, this ticked all the boxes dispite some bad reviews, would return any time.", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel\u201d", "Author": "cdntravels80", "ReviewID": "UR52948200", "Content": "We stayed at the Listel Hotel from December 31st, 2009 to January 4th, 2010 for a quick getaway for New Year's.

The room I stayed in on the sixth floor contained local first nation artwork from the University of BC. Some of this artwork can be purchased. This alone separates the Listel from most other hotels. I stayed in a room with a king-size bed which was as comfortable as it was wide and I had a view over Robson Street which was welcome. For the first night of our stay we were on the second floor and this room faced a bleak back street and we were woken by the noise of a garbage truck. When we bought thgis to the managements attention they had no hesitation in moving us to a room on the sixth floor with a view and less noise. One difference between the rooms was that the second floor room had a large flat screen tv mounted on the wall, whilst the sixth floor room had an old-style tv in a cupboard. The bathroom was small but adequate. There was a mini fridge in the room stocked to overflowing with every type of drink imaginable. You would have to be a heavy duty drinker to even go close to emptying this bar fridge. There were coffee making facitities in the room, but as is usual for North American hotels no hot water jug for tea drinkers like me. The water from the coffee pot is never hot enough to make a good cup of tea. The service was excellent and all the staff I encountered were extra friendly.

We had to wait some time, but the staff made sure we got our room asap. The room looked nice and clean, recently renovated, with a flatscreen tv, fridge etc. But... it faced the 'alley' behind the hotel. What we saw: ugly 10-15 story buildings, garbage cans and a homeless guy with a shopping cart, looking in the garbage cans. We like to sleep with open windows, so when we heard the noisy a/c unit from the back of the restaurant adjacent to the hotel we asked for another room. That was no problem at all. The 2nd room also faced the same alley, only there was some kind of electrical or water pump kind of thing (really don't know) that sounded like a constantly running engine. We felt terrible to ask for another room (I guess we were the staff's worst nightmare...), but again, that was not a problem. We upgraded (+ $20) to a room on the highest (6th) floor (616). I guess the $20 extra was for the higher floor, because the room was not recently renovated, there was no flat screen tv and we noticed orange mold in the shower. We spent the 1st of 3 nights in this room but didn't sleep well due to the same noisy a/c from the restaurant that we even heard on the highest floor. And we woke up early from noise around the garbage cans outside. The 2nd and 3rd night we slept in 617, which faced the street. We could even see the water. It was a 1 king bed room, but much nicer, cleaner, less worn out than 616. We didn't care about the street noise and were happy that we weren't bothered by the buzzing a/c. The valet service ($24/day) is very fast. The guy who works during the day turned out to be from the Netherlands (where we live)...so we spoke dutch. Nice.

Skytrain a 10 min walk away. The art work in the lobby, the hallways and the rooms is nice, but on the other hand....it doesn't add comfort to the visit. The hotel itself is great, we felt welcome.

The staff was very friendly and approachable! My husband and I are not very \"artsy\" but appreciated the local art displayed through out the hotel! I especially enjoyed the complimentary french press coffee delivered directly to our room in the morning and the free upgrade to a room with an ocean view! I was a bit concerned our room might be noisy as it over looked Robson St but this was not an issue at all! Also felt O'Doul's restaurant not all it was cracked up to be, although we just dined there for breakfast only. Over all Listel was a perfect choice for our Canadian get away!", "Date": "June 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria", "Title": "\u201cYou will be impressed!\u201d", "Author": "jeremygriese", "ReviewID": "UR27321844", "Content": "My family enjoys staying in a hotel the night before taking a flight.

The first night I just booked a cheaper one, as we were only using it for limited hours and didnt see the point in spending more. Well the listel was only about 30$ more and was a difference between night and day. I dont have to much $ to spend as a student but this hotel was worth it, with the online prices/specials tho!. It was a great location for shopping -on robson- , dining, and a quick taxi ride to Granville, on the bus route, or a 10 min walk to the sky train. Upon arrival the front desk was very curtious, polite, and helpful. I asked for a king size when we got there but there was none left, and to make up for it he put me in one of the nicer standard rooms on the 2nd floor (note my reservation said a queen so this was no fault of theirs) . One of my biggest memories still, is the aroma of the room. They use aromatherapy everything, for lotion, shampoo, conditioner... the smell was wonderful and lingered lightly throughout the room. The room was also very clean, and full of all the extras you may need -or like- including the flat screen on the wall and fully stalked mini bar, nuts, snacks, reading material, etc. There is also an optional quick-order breakfast card for your desired time. And a complimentary french press coffee-or tea delivered to your door in the morning, also at desired time. Check out was also a great time, 12pm, instead of the standard 11pm. They even gave us an extended check-out to suit our needs. We didn't have time to check out the business center or fitness area, but we did use the internet in our room. Wireless was a little slow, so we asked for a cord to plug in at our desk, with no problem. If i had to pick some negatives, room service was a 'tad' expensive. Well breakfast anyways. Could use a little more art on this floor, as it is a featured art-hotel. Valet was curtious, but more a pain for us when we are not used to it.. because if we forgot something in our car we couldn't just go down to the parking and get it, we had to be escorted every time. Also remember the parking fee, that your pretty much have to pay anywhere you go downtown Vancouver. If you pay for over night parking at a standard parkade it is $20, the Listel is $24 because of the extra security/valet, although it wouldn't hurt to for them be a tad cheaper than parkades as a kind gesture to guests.

Tastefully appointed rooms, professional staff, a good bar, reasonable prices, and excellent location all contribute to an overall more-than-satisfactory stay. LOCATION The Listel is located downtown on Robson Street. Although I didn't get much of a chance to do any exploring, there are plenty of good places to eat and drink in walking distance, and the area has a good downtown vibe to it. There's a nice mix of business and residential buildings in the area. It's also close (10-minute walk) to Skytrain, which I found to be a good way to get places around the city (and much cheaper than a cab). Make sure you know which line you're on and which direction you're going, though; it can be confusing at first. ROOMS I've stayed in both Museum and Gallery level floors; both are stylish and well-appointed. Both rooms had a large work station, which was important since I had a fair amount of work to do. The beds and linens were high quality, bathrooms were small but pleasing, and everything was very clean--cleaning staff defintely gets high marks. If you want to run up your minibar tab, there are a wide variety of drinks and snack that will help you accomplish that. (There was even a \"lover's package\" container in the minibar; I'll leave its contents to your imagination. Useful if you're traveling with your spouse or love interest; not so much if you're by yourself, although be it far from me to judge.) The rooms are very quiet--always a bonus. FACILITIES The lobby is small and functional; not a place you hang out (go to the bar next door). I managed to drag myself to the exercise room for a quick workout. It's very small, with a few cardio machines and a universal gym. There's also a jacuzzi, which I didn't use. If you want a more serious workout, there's a gym that you can use, free of charge, a few blocks away. The equipment at the gym was fine, but it was crowded and a bit grimy. Bring your own lock if you want a locker. Odouls, the restaurant, has a good bar with friendly staff. There's frequently jazz playing in the later evenings. It's a comfortable place to get a drink and unwind, and the guys behind the bar are attentive and make a good gin and tonic. There are some decent beers and wines by the glass, and the wine list does a nice job of highlighting local vintners while providing plenty of alternatives from Europe, Australia, Washington, and California. The food's pretty good, too. You can get both wired and wireless internet access. I found the wired to be much faster, and I always bring my own cable so I didn't have to get one from the front desk. Generally, it has pretty much everything the typical business traveler needs. STAFF Hotel staff was helpful and professional. Both check-in and check-out were swift. I didn't really have any challenging requests, so I don't know how they'd handle those. SUMMARY Comfortable rooms, good restaurant/bar, satisfactory amenities, good location, good price. If you want to stay downtown, don't want to spend a bundle, but still want to stay in a nice place, you can do a lot worse than the Listel.

This seems perfectly safe as only staff have access but it is a bit inconvenient. The hotel has a lovely bar and restaurant and is decorated to a high stadard throughout.

There are some great restaurants within 5 minutes walk and we found the area to be very safe at night. However, the views from the rear of the hotel do overlook some rather run down high rise appartment blocks. Dont be put off by this.

The hotel is in a great location - right on Robson Street and easy walking to all the sites. Having said that Vancouver is an easy city to walk around and any centrally located hotel will give you a good base. The on-site restaurant and bar O'Douls served excellent food , and the staff were really knowledgeable and helpful with wine selections. However, the room was average. Whilst the hotel attempts to project a groovy ambience, this is not really reflected in the room decor, which is tired, with a very old TV . As others have commented, the bathrooms are small - in fact ours was tiny - you could stretch out your arms and easily touch the walls. It was so tiny, the sink/basin wasnt even in the bathroom , but in the room, just inside the door as you walk in. The 'Art Hotel' moniker was also a puzzle. Our room (on the gallery floor) did have 3 lovely pictures but there was no information at all about the artist in the room.

Having done quite a bit of research on hotels here, I chose The Listel based on the website and many positive reviews it's received on the travel blogs. I chose The Listel particularly because it was a boutique hotel, with art. The photos and text on the Listel website and in its brochures in no way resembles the hotel rooms as they presently are. Initially, I was taken to a suite which featured only three works of art - and NO other color in the living area, bedroom, or especially the bath. We asked to see two other suites and they were little better. I then went down to the front desk and asked for the manager, but was told there was none onsite to speak with. Pointing out that nothing we'd seen even remotely resembled the website photos, I was shown the suite actually shown in the photo. It was unmade, but it was offered. There is little in the way of d\u00e9cor, other than a few paintings and two ceramics. There ARE colored pillows, but they are few. There are no flowers, books, etc. as shown on the website, and the furniture is worn and shabby. The drapes in the bedroom do not come all the way down to the ledge, and so bright lights from Robson Street stream in all night for the person sleeping closest to the window. A small television in the living area, an armoire that is very difficult to use and no two-line phone as advertised. The lighting - area lighting, task lighting, etc. is poor or nonexistent. MOREOVER, the bathroom should be an embarrassment to hotel management. Plastic, prefabricated, monotone color, no d\u00e9cor whatsoever, a cracked sink, low water pressure and, to top it off, the toilet backed up and we had to call maintenance. I will say that the porter was very helpful and friendly. He was the highlight of our stay. I debated long and hard about leaving the hotel early, and the manager offered to move us, but did not want to waste our time moving when we came to explore and enjoy this city. The Listel Hotel has a good premise and it appears that it once was what it purports to be - special, sophisticated, wonderful.

Ask if you reserve through the hotel about different views - we were very lucky to have an amazing view of the water, mountains, and Robson Street out our windows. I believe the Gallery Rooms might be on the higher numbered floors with better views? (Paid $155 Canadian per night.) The Gallery Rooms also come with free delivered french press coffee or tea every morning until 9, which was a nice way to start the morning. The room was everything one expects in a quality boutique hotel - comfortable bed, good pillows, good shower with consistent water pressure/temperature, nice toiletry items (Aveda shampoo, conditioner, soap). The location here is fabulous, and it's great to be right near the shopping and restaurants of Robson Street, but we did not have any noise issues at all (either from other rooms or from Robson Street itself). And I know we had neighbors in both rooms next to our room, so at least in my experience, the soundproofing is quite good. The location was wonderful - central to almost everything. You can easily walk to Stanley Park, the waterfront, downtown, or towards the water in the other direction to get a little boat to Granville Island. Renting bikes to ride through Stanley Park was very fun! It is also central to the city buses, so we took the bus to other areas of town. We took a bus to the Seabus port, and then transferred to another bus to get to the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge (the \"free\" suspension bridge). City buses are $2.25-$2.50 Canadian and include all transfers (including the seabus) for up to 90 minutes. We ate light dinner (salads and desserts) in the hotel restaurant one night and breakfast. We also later discovered the hotel restaurant has a bar menu that has lower priced menu options than the regular restaurant dinner menu. The hotel has live jazz every night, although it seemed like the musicians took a lot of breaks, more than average? But we enjoyed the live music we did experience! The food we ate there was very good. In my experience, regular downtown Vancouver was more business oriented. Gastown seemed a little too touristy but was nice for walking through. I think the West End part of downtown is a perfect location for a pleasure trip (or close enough to the other parts of downtown if you're there for business).

We arrived at around eleven in the morning, and because check in time wasn't until three, we were hoping to check our bags at the hotel, and to return a few hours later. Much to our surprise, they had our room ready, and we were told that we could go straight up there. There was a little confusion at the front desk - and after looking at my boyfriend and I, the receptionist asked if we'd meant to book two twin beds instead of a king sized bed. We were delayed at the front desk for about ten minutes while she asked for ID from us, and seemed a bit concerned that we were under aged (we're both 19). After confirming this, we went upstairs. Our room was very basic, with a large comfortable bed, and a disappointingly tiny bathroom. There was a mini-bar, which was locked, and after looking around, we saw that there wasn't a key for it in the room. When I had a shower, the water never really reached a 'hot' temperature, even after I turned it up all the way. It took about ten minutes for it to really warm up. That night, after exploring the city, we came back to the hotel and ordered room service. Our order came very quickly - in about fifteen minutes. The meal came out to about $30 - including a tip, and the food was good. A few things were forgotten, however - dips and certain condiments that were promised on the menu - but otherwise, it was fine.

If they had bathrooms with showers on commercial aircraft, this is probably be what they would be like. This was our first time in Vancouver. We enjoyed our stay, and liked the ambience of this hotel. If you don't want to stay in a place where you are the only one not on a package cruise trip, this might be the place.

Since we booked with Expedia, we were not told that we had to have a credit card to book into the room. We offered a large cash deposit with our passports, but the hotel did not accept it. The only reason we got was because \"it was hotel policy\". At every other hotel we have stayed at, they have accepted a cash deposit in lieu of a credit card. We had to have an authorization from someone else faxed to us. If we didn't already pay for the hotle, we definatly would have gone somewhere else at this time. The room itself was alright, although we had to take our bags up there ourself. However, you have to insert the keycard in the elevator before you can choose a floor. The front desk staff did not make us aware of this, another guest at the hotel did. It was not a boutique hotel as advertised. The only good thing about this hotel was the location.

The staff while friendly and nice, but were not truly service oriented. For example, no one ever offered to help with bags, they actually seemed to turn away whenever bags were around and had to be asked. This was quite weird as sometimes there were three or four staff just standing around smiling. The most serious problem is that we were put in room 321, right above the restaurant roof. There was a loud clanging ventillation fan on all night, which meant we had to keep the windows closed. There also was a vent from the hot tub right below our window, with a strong chlorine smell, another reason the windows had to stay closed. We asked to move and they were happy to move us while we were out -- but to a higher floor in the same vicinity with the same problem.
