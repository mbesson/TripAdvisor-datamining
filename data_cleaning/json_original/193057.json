However, the location doesn't compensate for the hotel's shortcomings. No-one books a Travelodge expecting the best service ever, but even at very competitive room rates, basics shouldn't be the exception. Though we booked a double room, clearly stating two-person occupancy (in spite of a misleading website defaulting to single occupancy, then having to pay extra to change the booking), there was only one towel in the bathroom and no bath mat. A second towel still didn't appear after three requests, so we collected one from reception. It appeared several other guests had the same problem, as the pre-breakfast towel queue at reception the next morning demonstrated. We arrived an hour early for check-in at 2pm, but were told there was no left-luggage facility for suitcases. We had either the choice of carrying suitcases around central London for an hour, or paying \u00c2\u00a310 extra to check-in early. So, the room was actually vacant and cleaned, it's just that they wanted to get a further tenner from us for the pleasure of renting it for an extra hour. Staff were completely indifferent to any requests. It's clearly a case of 'get 'em in and get 'em out quickly': it's almost as if guests are an inconvenience. Rooms are very basic and painted in a less-than0-welcoming corpse-white, but in fairness ours was clean and quiet with a comfortable bed. Energy-saving bulbs mean you're moving in an eerie twilight for most of then time. Breakfast was acceptable, but no-one tells you to pay at reception for vouchers before you go into the breakfast room. It's a shame the hotel doesn't try a little harder: it has the potential to be so much better with very little extra effort.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTheater trip\u201d", "Author": "marbar15", "ReviewID": "UR126267992", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights during a theater trip.

The party I was traveling with all stayed at the hotel for two nights. The Covent Garden tube station was literally a few minutes walk away but Leicester Square was only 10 so it was really easy to get to our destination in the mornings by foot. We didn't pay for breakfast in the hotel and were pleased we didn't, as there were plenty of cafe's, patisseries and big chain brands such as Pret a Manger nearby where you could pick up a bite to eat in the mornings. As well as this there are many bars, pubs and restaurants within walking distance where you can eat in the evenings, with a wide range of cuisines. It stated under the check-in information when you pay for this hotel, that you cannot check-in until 2.30 or later. Even at 2.28 they still would not start the check-in procedure and a massive queue had begun to form. This was a little frustrating, but then I suppose this is company policy, and if you do decide on the day to drop off your bags a little earlier you can do so for a cost of \u00c2\u00a310. On the whole, the reception staff were really helpful and were happy to provide us with extra pillows and hairdryers to use for the duration of our stay and the rooms also provides plenty of teas, coffees and milk. My room was on the ground floor of the hotel and there was a really odd banging sound during the duration of each night. The other guest in my room is a very light sleeper and found this kept her awake, but I had no problems. If you are a light sleeper I would recommend that you request a high floor to avoid this. In terms of the room, it appears ours was recently refurbished as it was much more modern and up to date than some of our other friends'. Maybe they are in the process of updating the hotel? But it was spotlessly clean and the beds, as usual, were really comfortable. My only moan is that I do like a powerful shower and this one was far from it, but I can't complain!

The bathroom was small but looked okay on first glance. So the negative? Mattress was soft and bed squeaked everytime I moved, the divan was a bit grubby, the bath was chipped and stained where the shower hose was touching the bath, and the toilet seat was falling off. Also, we did not have any warm water in two of our rooms which was a pain as we were getting ready to go out at night. A cold shower was had! My colleague complained to reception and we were told that there had been a problem with the boiler, and that it had been fixed, but that if we experienced any problems the following day, we could move rooms.

The room was tiny and very basic. There is a very thin duvet and we only had one tiny pillow on the bed. There was a chair and a vanity area with no mirror. Plugs for hairdryers etc are no where near any of the mirrors and you need to put your make up on in the bathroom in both aday and night for decent light.The bathroom had a shower which did not have hot water (it was tepid and the shower did not drain very well wither) for the whole duration we were there and there was no soap or anything to wash with. We had lights that did not work so we were in a darkened room for most of the weekend. We only had one towel and one pillow for a double room. We returned to reception to report the lights and to request further towels and pillows to be asked why we needed them (there was one towel and two people in the room?!) and was told they had neither and to return later. We asked for at least some towels as we were going out for the evening and was grudgingly given one extra towel. After staying at the hotel for two nights and returning to reception to request pillows frequently we were never given any.The uninterested receptionists excuse? They only have a limited supply. How on earth does a hotel only have a limited supply of basic items? Whilst we were supposedly in a refurbished room (fittings did not work) I would have hated to see the old rooms. They were run down already. The staff hadnt bothered to clean the window or the TV and the room looked very jaded with scratches and marks on the wall. Although it is ideally located for covent garden and theatreland I would never stay there again.The staff are uncaring and uninterested in any problems you have and the rooms have been shabbily refurbished. Whilst at a Travelodge I am aware you cannot expect 5* facilities, I would however expect to have decent service and the correct facilities (ie towels/pillows in ratio to the number pf people staying in the room). The only decent thing about the place was breakfast. There was a good choice of hot and cold food and it was well cooked, top marks to the kitchen! I found the hotel very dissapointing and overpriced. Had it not been Baftas weekend and half term, I would have tried to move hotels.If you are happy with price over comfort and standards, go for it.

Because of this it was large and the bathroom was actually a wet room which seemed to have all the aids someone in a wheelchair might need, such as all the bars to help them in the shower, to use the toilet etc. We didn't really want a ground floor room, and are able bodied, so went to reception to request a room on a higher floor. This wasn't a problem. We were given a room on the 9th floor (top floor). This room was, as expected, smaller with a regular shower room. The room was very clean, apart from the carpet which was stained and I was personally not happy to walk around on barefoot. The bed was comfortable and the tv was located at the end of the bed, which was good. It was a corner room and the small window was located in the corner of the building so the room was very dingy - not a big problem as we didn't intend to spend much time in the room. We did need another pillow and towel, which wasn't a problem when we went down to reception. There is no hairdryer in the room, but again available on request at reception.

I used the self check-in (so didn't get to request a high/refurbished room) but then had to use reception anyway because the machine had no keys left! That said check in at the reception was very easy and the staff just took my details and handed me the key card. Check out was even easier, just give in the key card and off you go! I was in the Drury Lane building and only on the second floor. The view out of my window was of the back of the hotel with the vans pulling up early the next morning. But I wasn't going to London to sit staring out the window anyway so it was hardly an issue. I was up early the next morning as well so the noise wasn't problematic (it's central London, if you want peace and quiet then go to the countryside). The room itself was refurbished just last month (01/12). It smelt brand new, looked brand new and was absolutely amazing. The bed was comfy, the heating was adequate (only a small heater but I was warmer during the night than I would've been at home). The storage space was good enough for one or two nights. The bathroom had a shower, the water wasn't red hot but was enough for a quick shower. I didn't have the breakfast the next morning but I did have a meal the night before, the resteraunt area is very nice and the meal itself was also very good. I would definitely eat there again. There was also the option to have it in the room. All in all it was a fantastic stay and as most of the rooms will eventually be refurbished it kind of makes a lot of reviews on here null and void, because the rooms will be refurbished to a high standard and are brand new. The problem isn't with the maintenance but with the people that stay in the hotels, the toilet roll holder had a used plaster shoved down the middle of it, so some dirty bugger has done that in a matter of weeks of that room being opened. It's just disgusting and if people don't respect the rooms and look after them then they'll end up like the old rooms pictured on here within a short while.

We were in the building on High Holborn which is literally just around the corner from the Drury Lane site. I would say it is worth calling beforehand to check which building you are in as when we arrived it was cold, wet and windy and if you have to go from one building to the other to check in, it can be slightly annoying. It is also worth calling beforehand to request a refurbished room - I noticed that someone else had commented this so did call and did get a refurbished room (no idea whether my phone call made a difference!!). The hotel could not be more conveniently located close to Covent Garden. When we arrived, it was extremely busy however there is a self serve check in machine in reception which we used and was very quick and efficient (not quite sure why others didnt seem to be using it....). Our room was basic but clean and tidy. There are no pictures or ornaments. There were sufficient towels and bedding for us all. There were tea/coffee making facilities. The only thing I could comment on the negative is that there was only one toilet roll and we had to ask for more! Overnight, I did hear sirens but expected this as you are in Central London. We were warned that breakfast the next day would be busy however when my husband and I went down at around 8.30 we didnt have to queue and got a table immediately. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the hot food was kept topped up and replenished at all times. Our girls didnt come down for breakfast as we had a late night the night before but the restaurant staff gave us two plates to take food up for them. When we got back to the room on the afternoon we were a little surprised to find that the room hadnt been cleaned - we had to ask for fresh towels and more toilet roll!! We then popped out for a coffee and when we returned it had actually been done....

Initially we were given a room on the 2nd floor in a section of the hotel which had clearly not been refurbished. I'm not someone who usually makes a fuss and I totally accept that you get what you pay for in a travelodge, but the entire corridor had a strange smell and when we opened the door of the room it smelled of raw sewage. There was urine in the toilet so it had obviously not been cleaned either. It was a twin room and we'd booked a double (the receptionist even confirmed 'double' as were checking in) so we immediately returned to ask for a double room (I didn't bother complaining about the smell). However, the manager was there (dealing with other complaints!) and he put us into a room on the 4th floor. This time, we were sent in the other direction (still in the Drury Lane building - not the other one across the road) and it was immediately obvious from the decor in the corridor that we were in a section of the hotel that had been 'done up'. Our room, although much smaller was much MUCH better and had a new bathroom and new double glazed windows. If the first room had been a double, as opposed to a twin, I probably wouldn't have complained and would have had a miserable night. If I stay here in future, I will ask for a refurbished room to begin with and I advise others to do the same.

What other hotel?? Apparently the Travelodge has two hotels, one on Drury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lane and a second building 1 block up the road on High Holbom. So after the brilliant and helpful service we received at check-in (being sarcastic there) we went for a wonder up the road and found the other building. Here the guys on reception were a lot better and directed us to the lift and apologised for the confusion. The room was quite large and clean looking, the bed was a little firm but not too bad. We had a kettle in the room with some coffee packets and a TV with some freeview channels. The wardrobe was huge and could fit enough clothes in there to last a month. The bathroom was ok, the basin and bath had some signs of mould around the edges and plug holes but were relatively clean. The worst thing about this hotel was the corridors to get to your rooms.

The earlier you book the cheaper the rooms are. In terms of Covent Garden this could be as cheap as \u00c2\u00a329 per room per night, but could be as much as \u00c2\u00a3179, i believe, per room per night and as far as I am aware there is no difference in the rooms for the differing price. Having stayed here three times I have had three very different experiences. For this reason I will break down the review: Location - Situated on the outskirts of Covent Garden you will not find a better location for a budget type hotel. It is easily within walking distance of Covent Garden underground station, but is also very accessible from both Holborn and Tottenham Court Road underground stations as well. For this reason it is easy to get to from the Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines. This also makes it very accessible to Oxford Street, Tottenham Court Road end and also Soho as well as Shaftesbury Avenue and Theaterland. Basically very well located. Leaving the hotel you can be in Covent Garden in three to four minutes. There are lots of bars along the way making it idea for those who want to capitalise on not driving! Hotel Itself - For some strange reason Travelodge have decided to make two buildings the Covent Garden Travelodge. One building on one side of High Holborn which I believe used to be a Moat House Hotel and one on the other side of High Holborn. Apparently you can check in at either and then make you way to your room. The buildings are typical for Travelodge accommodation, however you are booking a Travelodge and not a hotel so expect it to be kind of cheap and cheerful. Rooms - This is the part that I have the biggest issue with. With Travelodge I expect clean, tidy and a good standard, not luxury, but a good standard where things work properly. On our first stay had a room in the ex Moat House side which was really good, room seemed newly refurbished was light and airy, bed was comfortable. Second visit the room, again in the ex Moat House side, was very small, the light fitting near the bed had the actual light broken off the wall leaving only the main light to light the room. In the bathroom the sink did not run clear, the waste pipes must have been blocked. The light above the bath was not working, which meant having a shower in the dark. Worst of all the duvet cover was ripped at the seams in places and the duvet did not fit properly in to the cover at the bottom. The third visit was in the other building. This time the bed was not fit to be slept in. The mattress was in urgent need of replacement. The shower worked, but only provided a trickle of water and there was not remote control for the TV. Parts of the hotel have an old wood type aroma both in the corridors and the rooms, again not expecting high standard, but the place should still clean and presentable Food - I have never eaten at this Travelodge so cannot comment. Staff - The new automated checkin system means that you rarely, if ever, come into contact with Travelodge staff making it very difficult to comment on. Overall - If you pay \u00c2\u00a329 for a hotel room here then you get great value for money if you can put up with the likelihood of getting a bed that is far too old and soft.

I was shocked that the first receptionist checked me into a faulty room and even more shocked that he didn't tell me about it!

Two separate buildings on High Holborn, and across the road on Drury Lane. We stayed in the Drury Lane building, which in itself has 2 very distinct halves - 2 towers joined by the main reception, restaurant & bar. When we checked in we were put in the left tower of the hotel (left as you face it from outside). The corridors were very tired and tatty as was the room. We were going to put up with it as we didn't have high expectations for a budget hotel in central London. However 2 of the bulbs in the bathroom were broken, which made the room too dark to use the mirror to shave etc. So we went to report it to reception. The receptionist was a very friendly helpful girl, who told us that maintenance weren't in over the weekend, but she could move us to a different room on the other side of the hotel. She didn't say the rooms there were better, but we realised as soon as we saw them, that she moved us there for that reason. It was like a different hotel in the right tower of the hotel. Clearly recently refurbished. Can't really say anything bad about the room - considering it is a budget, no-frills hotel. Clean, new, good bed, good lighting, modern bathroom with walk-in shower. We were delighted! Could do with a safe though. The windows were triple glazed so kept noise out brilliantly. (This wasn't so on the old side of the hotel) Location is excellent, in the heart of the West End. Its a short walk from Covent Garden & Leicester Square. We give the right side of the Drury lane building 4 stars. If we'd only stayed in the left side, we would have given it 1-2 star, thats how different the buildings are! We didn't get to see the rooms in the Holborn building so we can't comment on that. We would definitely stay there again, only we would specify exactly which part of the hotel we want to be in!!

This area also includes free wi-fi, which is helpful when looking to keep up with your e-mails. The breakfasts have improved since my last visit and the selection is very good. The staff were very helpful throughout our stay - including moving myself and the person I went with when the original room was found to be of a poor standard and resolving an issue with a person in a neighbouring room who was making a lot of noise at 1 am on one of the days of our trip. The location is perfect for central London with good bus and tube networks nearby and being within easy walking distance of Theatreland. Now for the downside. Although the reception area has been renovated, the room I stayed in lacked attention to detail. Some of the ceiling tiles were broken, spotlights weren't working and there was evidence of mould in the bathrooms - both in our originally allocated room and following our room change. Additional to this, the lift and lobby areas on the floor where we stayed (Floor 2) smelled of damp, which wasn't pleasant to be greeted with.

The only two lights in the room were the bedside lights. This made the room very dark and difficult to see in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even in broad daylight. In order to be able to see down the one end of the room we had to leave the bathroom door open and the bathroom light on! I think this hotel has been made out of converting an old office building which tends to give some unusually shaped rooms. The interior of the room was very tired and in need of a serious refurbishment (and additional lighting). The furniture all looked very old and worn. The double bed was incredibly lumpy and the pillows were thin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was akin to placing your head on an After Eight mint. I asked at reception for another pillow but was told there were none. This I find highly unbelievable and generally equates to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This was particularly annoying as the website says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ask at reception if you need . . . any extra pillows\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The walls of the room were paper thin meaning that you could hear your neighbours and their TVs all the while. The bathroom was really old with discoloured ceiling tiles and no plug for the sink. We stayed for two nights. When the room was serviced after the first night they only left one towel and took away one the cups for the tea and coffee making. Although the room was old and tired it did sort of look clean (although it was difficult to confirm this due to the darkness of our room!). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have breakfast in the hotel as we thought it was overpriced, instead we can thoroughly recommend Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Verona just over the road. So what were the good points about this hotel? As Kirsty and Phil say on their Channel 4 property programme . . . location, location, location! The hotel is right in the heart of central London, only a stones throw from the 7 dials, Covent Garden Market, Theatre Land and the West End. The other big plus is the price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is very reasonable for a central London hotel (I think we paid \u00c2\u00a389.99 a night). So would I go back? Maybe!

The room itself was clean, average size, bathroom also clean and a decnet size. Plenty of tea and coffee in the room. When we arrived back late Saturday night we asked if we could have more pillows as there was only enough for one each in the room, these were brought to our room about 10 minutes later. Breakfast was good, the usual Travelodge selection, we had to wait a little while for the hot selection to be restocked but this was not a problem and not having a lot out at a time meant it was fresh and hot. The only slight hiccup was we had to clear a table as all empty ones had dirtly plates etc on, but there seemed to be only one girl clearing so don't know if they were short staffed and anyway it was not an issue for us. If i were to be really picky, there was no hairdryer in the room, but i am sure had i gone and asked for one, it would have been provided.

Most of the staff i encountered were very helpful within the bounds of the authority they had, so if your looking for refunds or compensation regarding your stay like i am you will get told to deal with head office. All of the above considered there are some key points i feel i should make people aware of: 1. Mattresses are to thin and soft, no support. 2. Beds / Mattresses need to be secured in order to prevent them sliding away from the wall the bed is against. 3. Duvets have all the thickness of a piece of tissue paper and do not fill the duvet covers. 4. Pillows (of which there were only 3 in the room) have no support or thickness. The have all the comfort value of a 3 day old pancake. 5. Anyone checking in to Covent Garden and being assigned rooms 60 - 75 on the ground floor should be warned about the possible noise level that is frankly unacceptable.

We easily achieved this, paying around \u00c2\u00a3250 for 6 nights on the last week of August/first week of September bank holiday week. Having paid an extra \u00c2\u00a310 to arrive for early check-in, we were greeted with a large queue of people checking in, with relatively few staff to do so. There were also newly checked in people complaining about the quality of their room in the lower floors (which was like a basement, I believe) The reason why there seemed to be a lack of staff was because the keycard scanner had stopped working, and so required staff having to take people to their rooms and manually check them in. We are happy-go-lucky enough people and weren't particularly bothered by the fact that the room was tiny, and smelled damp, bearing in mind that the people checking out could have been there just 30 mins earlier. The room was freshly laundered, but was missing a kettle and tea making facilities, and we found the much discussed one towel for two people -easily rectified, but it meant the long queues and escort by a member of staff because of the keycard situation. We left the hotel to explore around 3pm and encountered a huge number of people trying to check-in. Very glad we paid the extra to get in early. Over the course of the week, we can only say that it served its purpose as somewhere to lay our head, as we were out as much as possible. Location is amazing - right on the corner of Covent Garden, 5 minute walk from either Covent Garden or Holborn Tube station, mini-Sainsburys around the corner (which also served ready-to-eat hot currys), and you could be in the hustle and bustle of the Piazza of Covent Garden in around 2-3 mins. The British Museum was also a short walk away to the North. We didn't sample the breakfast or the evening meal, as we preferred to do our own thing (like another reviewer, we can heartily recommend The Ideal Sandwich Bar on Parker Street), and there are a load of chain restaurants on the Kingsway where Holborn Tube is (such as Ask, Cafe Rouge, etc), but again were very popular and if the literature was to be believed, would set you up nicely for the day. What we would say is that there was a sound of breaking glass to wake us up every morning as the refuse lorries did their job, but everything was just fine ... clean and basic. Only towards the end of the week did the cleaning staff replenish the tea and coffee and TWO towels every morning. We also had to report a blown bulb on the final day as we were packing to leave - although someone came to see that there was indeed a problem and that a glass bulb had blown, leaving us (and the entire floor) in darkness, because someone reset the fuse in the meantime, no effort was made to clear the broken glass through the bathroom, and the chemicals in the halogen lights are also toxic. Not great when there are no extractors in the room (which also probably accounted for the dampness on our arrival) On the whole, budget alue for a good location, however if we were to stop for more than a night in London in future, we would choose ANYWHERE else and pay for the associated luxuries.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clacton", "Title": "\u201cSo glad i didn't cancel!\u201d", "Author": "Jacqui P", "ReviewID": "UR119889003", "Content": "As i had booked a theatre show for my boyfriends birthday i thought it would be nice to stay nearby overnight and make the most of our time in London and so i chose the Covent Garden Travelodge. It was only after i had booked this hotel that i read the reviews on tripadvisor, and i was absolutely mortified to read such bad reviews! I came very close to cancelling my booking but decided to take a chance and hope for the best. We arrived just after 3pm and were immediately approached by a lovely lady asking if she could help us, i gave her my booking reference number and asked her if we could have a newly refurbished room. She booked us in on the self service booking machine and it had allocated us an old room, so she went straight to the reception desk and told them we would like to change our room. The lady on reception checked but there were no rooms available in the other building so she made a telephone call then told us Room 911 was available in the Drury Lane Building and that it was a refurbished room... we were a little apprehensive when told the room number..911..but thought oh well, we can only but try.. so we got the lift to the 9th floor, the corridors and lift were bright and clean, and when we got to the room we were very pleasantly suprised and SO relieved! Ok it wasn't a huge room, but the double bed was ample, the sheets were clean, 6 coathangers, a little dressing table, mirror on wall next to TV, and the carpet wasn't stained or dirty as i had feared and no light fittings hanging off the wall anywhere! The bathroom was small but adequate, the toilet, sink and shower were lovely and clean almost like new with no mould in sight anywhere! Shower worked fine, although only one spotlight above sink was working out of the 2 but this was quite bright enough! We knew the windows wouldn't fully open due to safety reasons but it was enough to cool the room down which did get quite warm on this particular sunny October day! You could just see the London Eye in the distance if you looked to the left but the view didn't really bother us. As expected after reading reviews there was only 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel but we were lucky enough to see the cleaners in the hallway and so took an extra couple of towels from the trolley! I was a little dubious about the towel already in the bathroom as it had a dirty mark on it, i think this may have been overlooked as there is a sign telling guests to leave dirty towels in shower and i can only presume this may have been left on the handrail..? Anyway, we slept soundly, no noise from outside whatsoever, and no other noisy guests in the corridor, not even the sound of banging doors usually heard when other guests go down for breakfast! Talking of breakfast, we went down to a lovely clean restaurant and although it was 10.40am (it closed at 11) there was plenty of food available, croissants, muffins, cereal, fruit, the cooked breakfast was lovely and hot, and at no point were we rushed out, in fact it was 11.15am when we left the restaurant and there were still people in there eating! I would definitely stay at this Travelodge again and cannot believe there are so many bad reviews about it. The staff were all really lovely and friendly, we had a laugh and a joke with the girls on reception and even the cleaners we met in the corridors greeted us with a polite and friendly hello!

Our block also overlooked Holburn High Road, and again I suspect this is noisy. There is no A/C in the rooms so you need to open the windows if it's hot, so noise would be an issue on these sides of the hotels. So to sum it up - it's a Travelodge on 2 sites, with good and bad rooms. Reception is busy at check in time, and when coach groups turn up - again pretty normal.

After researching the 'theatrebreak' type packages, I decided to save money and worry and book with the Travelodge - it being a chain I could rely on (i hoped!) After reading reviews on this website I was very apprehensive about booking. However, I took the advice of many reviewers and phoned the hotel to ensure I could have a room on the Drury Lane side (i've read it has recently been refurbished). The staff were very helpful over the phone - although getting the phone number was a bit difficult, as on the website it only gives the customer service/booking line number and not the direct number for this particular hotel. Upon arrival, the hotel looked much better than i'd anticipated - it's a white building block, not the prettiest sight but it's resided alongside lovely London streets with shops and little cafes (great for breakfast if you like to have a lie in!) The hotel was perfect. Very clean, with a little bar. Our room was a double room and obviously very basic, with the essentials. We had a little window so it was quite hot, but all in all we were pleased. I had no issues with broken furniture or dirty bathrooms. Despite reading others experiences of sleepless nights and lots of noise, we slept soundly and comfortably. Only issue I could say I had was that one of the staff members (perhaps he was new) told me that the bar closed at 4am... when in actual fact, it closes at 1. I do feel sorry for the bar staff however, the poor people, who had to deal with many many drunken people that particular night! Overall i'd really recommend this hotel.

I returned in October 2011 to stay for two nights, and was surprised to see that the place had been given a complete overhaul, only on this occasion I do not think for the better. Rather than the subdued lighting of before, now the main lobby is one large open space, with lighting that is garrulous and too bright, no sense of intimacy or privacy, and a roaring television drowning everything out. Food is not served until 5 pm but they will sell you overpriced beer from noon. Worst of all, they still enforce the 3pm check-in policy and attempt to charge a \u00c2\u00a310 fee to anybody who wishes to check in earlier, irrespective of whether the room is already made up or not. To add to that, WIFI is only free downstairs where there are few powerpoints to plug in, and a charge of \u00c2\u00a35 for 1 hour and \u00c2\u00a310 for all day is levied if you want to use WIFI in your room. This is increasingly an anomaly in the twenty-first century of hotel service. The staff are friendly but slow and clumsy, and it takes three of them to book us a taxi on the morning of departure. Furthermore, no tourist maps of London are available: this is the first time I have encountered the lack of such a service in a hotel anywhere. The rooms are now clinical and minimalist in decor but not design. There is little storage space for clothes, no air conditioning, and the brick effect in the bathroom is truly garrulous. The lifts are slow too - there are only two of them, and they are congested by staff using them as a service lift. On 50% of the occasions when I called a lift, it was clogged up with iron cages full of bedding and apologetic but uncompromising staff determined to make it down to the laundry as soon as possible. So far this review sounds very negative, which it is. However, there are some good points to this hotel. Its location is excellent for tourism, business and/or leisure in central London, it's a great place from which to explore Covent Garden, Soho and Theatreland, and it's hard to beat the price.

The shower room, though small (only room for 1 person at a time) again was fine and what I was expecting.

Anyway - arrived around 9pm to witness the most impressive display of indifference from a hotel receptionist I have seen in some time. Completely disinterested in serving me. This turned out to be the best interaction I had with a staff member at the hotel though. The room, in fairness, was large and spacious - probably appearing even more so due to the ridiculous sparseness of the furnishings. There was a double bed, creaky, and springy, but reasonably comfortable in certain positions.... a bizarre construction which looked like a wardrobe with no doors into which was stuffed several duvets, pillows etc; a \"workstation\" consisting of a narrow desk, and potentially the world's least comfortable chair (maximum time before I moved = 12 minutes) and something... something orange.... and couchlike, in the corner... frayed, battered, and nasty looking. See exhibit, er I mean picture 1. The bathroom was functional and clean - which is more than can be said for me after I took a \"shower\" - whether due to water pressure, the bizarre shower head, or some other reason, getting a shower was akin to standing under a dripping drain pipe hoping the water gets you. It was hot, granted, but I really didn't feel like I had achieved anything getting a shower. While early morning demand might explain this.... I took one in the afternoon (6pm) with exactly the same effect. The room is \"equipped\" with a TV (with signal quality varying from \"Ok, I guess\" to poor. That's it. Oh and a kettle with 4 cups and a small selection of drinks. Side story - I made a coffee and was staring at the coffee stain on the desk wondering how I became such a messy coffee maker... and how despite being such a messy coffee maker, the pattern of the spilled coffee on the outside of the cup was really quite intricate... until I realised that there was a crack in the cup so fundamental to its structure that coffee was literally leaking out of it and onto the desk. See exhibit 2. At this point I decided to mention this to reception... only to find... there is no phone!! NO PHONE!!! In a hotel room, in central London... Needless to say there is nothing else in the room - no iron, no safe, no wardrobe, no fridge, no ability to control the temperature, no drawers, no trouser press.... there is a bin. Says it all really. The walls are grubby and in need of a paint; the carpet is old, stained and nasty; the walls in the corridors are even worse and there is something very peculiar going on with the glass in the doors to the lift areas. In short (ish) I stay in hotels in London quite frequently. I know what you can get for \u00c2\u00a3200 a night... and this is not it. This is an absolutely disgraceful hotel for that price - if the rooms had been \u00c2\u00a350 a night I would still have been disappointed.

The room has no air con or any cooling fans and the extractor in the bathrooms dont work (neither do the ones in Bristol where we stayed last night). The beds have plastic mattress covers. All of which made for 3 very uncomfortable nights in stiffling heat with no escape once the shower humidity invades the room. We heard several guests complain about damp in their rooms and we did find an area of our carpet (near the window) to be wet/damp - it hadnt been raining. The room is sparsely decorated to the extent that there are no shelves to store clothing, just 6 hangers on a small rail. There are also no places for soap etc in the shower. Despite staying for 3 nights, we did have to ask for a second towel every day as they only supply one per room - we just asked for this on the way back from a day sightseeing.

We booked in to be told our booking reference and paperwork was wrong - sorry I only brought what Travelodge gave me.. Soon rectified, but made to feel an \"inconvienience\". My wife is disabled and asked for a disabled facility room. Fortunately she no longer needs her wheelchair as getting up the formidible steps in front of the hotel would have been impossible albut a few weeks ago. Even better the disabled room was on the eighth floor as far from the lift as was possible?? The rooms facilities were good, especially the bathroom as it was a wet room. Even having alarm facilities by the bed with a plug in for floor mats. Problem was that on arrival the lifts weren't working. \"Use the Service Lift\" was the response. Fine, but the service lift stops at the 7th floor, but we had to go back to the fifth floor, navigate to the \"new\" building then attempt three flights of steps which got us to the eighth, a total of 57 steps. Fortunate again that we didn't need a wheelchair although we both could have used oxygen by the time we got to our room. One lift was working again by the time we had to go down, but WHY put a disabled person on the EIGHTH floor. Its seems absurd to us. There is no way my wife could use the stairs, and even the fit residents were very pink when they tried. The next morning we did enjoy a great breakfast from the buffet. All well cooked and quality items from the cumberland type sausages, to the not too salty bacon, and excellent scambled eggs. As much as you can eat, well worth the money! On departure when I tried to claim back 50% of the NCP costs (as advertised) I was told the \"machine\" was in the other reception... I went hunting for another reception to no avail. I was told later that there is another Travelodge over the road, and then the original person accused me of not listening. I let it go, and forgave her ignorance as I know my listening skills are excellent. All said about the Lodge, you get what you pay for, a clean, functional but excellent room with optional (recommended) breakfast. Some members of staff seemed switched on, but some others just ruined the overall experience. To have the lifts go down is inexcusable, to have the garage closed is ridiculous as I assume that the service lift could have been used if you use a wheelchair or have difficulty with stairs.

Unless you are elderly or extremely unfit; everything you need this side of London is in relative walking distance. The hotel has been renovated fairly recently and it was a smooth experience on this occasion. I have previously stayed here and was shipped out to the 'annex' which is around the corner (Holborn i think). Do everything possible to avoid staying in this one. It's noisy at night and you can't sleep when the clubs turn out, the service was poor and we even had to collect our own pillows from reception. Many people complained the next morning. I was shattered due to the noise etc but any attempt to politely complain is met with a 'what do you expect from a budget hotel? response). Don't bother writing to head office, they don't care and one email I received was so dismissive almost to the point of rude. Enough said. Stay in Drury Lane and the experience is what I would have expected. Of the budget hotels I'm afraid that Premier Lodge beat Travelodge hands down, especially service and the breakfast. On this occasion however, the staff were friendly and helpful, check in was quick and they were happy to change my room so that I did not have the 'Holborn Experience' again as we were initially given a room around the corner. In short, it's the location that appeals and it's cheaper than most hotels in the area. Rooms are basic and there was plenty of room at breakfast, but not to the Premier Lodge standard.

In short the hotel is conveniently located close to many of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key areas. Unfortunately, despite booking the Drury Lane hotel we actually stayed in the Travelodge across the road which happens to be directly adjacent to a nightclub. Despite staying Sunday to Wednesday which I would personally consider not to be peak clubbing nights the noise level was unbearable. I would like to remind readers that my Fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and I are only 25, still socialise in clubs on occasion and are probably easier going than most with regards to noise levels and what we expect from hotels. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to complain and see hotels for city breaks as places to wash and sleep. Furthermore I am a deep sleeper and have been known to sleep through almost anything. The noise of the music was clearly audible in our room despite being on the 12th floor! The noise from drunken clubbers leaving and getting into the myriad of queuing taxis that sit directly below the hotel rooms is really unbelievable. No surprises that our quality of sleep was abysmal. The windows offer no sound proofing whatsoever. I have stayed all over London on much busier roads near much busier pubs and clubs. I have stayed in many other cities in busier locations and have never experienced noise like this. I would strongly urge anyone other than the deaf or hard of hearing to avoid this hotel. Location: Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fooled by the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCovent Garden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attached to the hotels name. It is about a 5 minute walk from Covent Garden. The hotels location is its one redeeming factor. Its situated close to The British Museum. Short walk to Covent Garden, The Strand, Shaftesbury Avenue, Oxford Street etc. It is equidistant from Holburn and Covent Garden tube stations. There is also a nightclub located directly below as I mentioned, if your looking for a nightclub. Room: The rooms are very much no frills. But clean and the bed was comfortable. The rooms are a decent size but sparsely decorated. Basically an empty room with a bed and dressing table with mirror and a flat screen TV. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe this to be a negative and found it refreshing not to have several couches, tables and chairs that do nothing but clutter rooms with unused furniture like most other hotels. The lack of air conditioning may be a problem for some in the summer. The windows are latched to open a minimal amount meaning the rooms are warm. But for the price this is to be expected. Food: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel during our stay. All you can eat breakfast is offered for a reasonable price of around \u00c2\u00a37.00. We opted t eat in a small caf\u00c3\u00a9 Called Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Verona across the road which was quick, friendly, reasonably priced and very good quality food. We also ate in a small bakery called Le Pain Quotidien attached to the Aveda saloon directly opposite which we would highly recommend if your willing to spend just a little bit more for a quality breakfast. Facilities: There is a bar which is opened to 5am which seemed nice enough. We used the internet service in the bar which was \u00c2\u00a31 for 20 minutes which is reasonable value for a London hotel. Summary: All in all the hotel offers a great location, clean and comfortable rooms at a very reasonable price. If I could overlook the unbelievable noise that emanates from the nightclub and its clubbers unfortunately located adjacent to the hotel I would highly recommend this hotel for those looking for cheap digs in London. But the noise was so bad it ruined every night of our stay. I would strongly urge anyone considering this hotel to think again, or purchase ear plugs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame really. Better sound proofing in the rooms or free ear plugs at check in might alleviate this problem. But I think anyone who stays on the evens side of the hotel on High Holburn will never return.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for what we needed after an initial issue!\u201d", "Author": "beagle_UK", "ReviewID": "UR117184743", "Content": "We checked in at the High Holborn building (which is newer than Drury Lane) and asked for a refurbished room and were suprised to be directed over to the Drury Lane building.

The beauty of this hotel is its location, right in the heart of west end theatreland. If this hotel is fully booked or a bit pricey (which for a Travelodge it can be) use the postcode WC2N 5DN on the Travelodge WEB site.

Using this postcode brings up the other London Travelodge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by distance from TSq, which are nearly always cheaper. Check in was quick and easy but there are two sites to this Travelodge but it seems not to matter which site you check in at. The two sites are only 1 minute apart. I cannot fault the politeness and helpfulness of the staff I spoke with during my stay. The newer building (about 18 Mths old) appears to be just family rooms. My room did the job but it seemed to have an ill-fitting window which seemed not to close properly. The light above the shower was not working making showering virtually in the dark. There is no phone in the room so you have to go down to reception or remember to put the reception phone number in your mobile. The rooms are not air-conditioned so beware in hot summer. The rooms do have heaters in. The bed I found very comfortable. I did not eat on site but there is a very brightly lit bar and restaurant area open 24 hours a day which seemed to be doing a busy trade. The newer building is right next door to Domino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pizza.

The taxi driver said he would take us to the accessible entrance [my husband has mobility issues and walks with a stick ] The taxi driver pressed the intercom and the staff let the taxi in . We got out of the taxi and saw a woman in a wheelchair pressing the assistance button [labeled in braille and English with international wheelchair symbol] as only one of the double doors had opened and there was too little space for her chair to get through . We spoke to the woman and she said her husband had gone to speak to the front desk staff regarding access, We chatted to her till her husband arrived a few minutes later and her husband said that the staff had told him to ''just press the button'' but pressing the button had no effect. We said that we would speak to the front desk for them again but as we went through the door, my husband noticed that there was another button on the inside which operated the other door - impossible to reach if in a wheelchair! We checked in dropped the bags , then left via this accessible entrance , had something to eat and went back to the hotel a couple of hours later and pressed on the intercom for access. The guy answering said that this was not the disabled access point any more and that no one was allowed in. We said- we arrived this way by taxi, as had the other guest in the wheelchair. [and we later heard from the woman in the wheelchair that she had used this entrance repeatedly during her stay with no problems] The staff member was rude and told us to ''just climb the stairs '' and said he was not opening the gate as this wasn't the disabled access point. It is possible that the staff member did not initially see my husband's walking stick on cctv but i told him immediately that my husband could not use stairs and walked with a walking stick The staff member eventually said he would come down and ''explain'' the problem to us and he eventually let us in the gate after arguments After some more discussion the staff member told us that there was a different disabled access point - which turned out to be a series of steep ramps into an alley - totally unmarked with wheelchair symbols AFAIK but bearing info about being a fire exit - It would be a nightmare in heavy rain or snow or ice or if self-propelling a wheelchair . My husband found it awkward in light rain using a stick i wasn't 100% convinced about this route as an official entrance given that the lady in the wheelchair told us she was entering and exiting via the original disabled access point throughout her stay things we liked- location was excellent - handy for covent garden shops / theatres etc , bed linen and bathroom was clean we got a decent price for the one night stay [2 rooms double and twin ] things we disliked - severe disabled access problems Room standard was below average for travelodges- decor was poor, light fittings were broken The staff member told us that the covent garden traveldoge was essentially 2 buildings and that at some point soon the two would be separate entities. It appears that the other, newer building is more disabled friendly -with fully accessible rooms so we would opt for the other building if staying in the area again", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "Nimbu2010", "ReviewID": "UR116882398", "Content": "Internet reservation states you can check in at either of the 2 buildings [3 or 4 minutes walk apart] but doesn't specify which one you'll actually stay in - so a 15 minute queue to check in [itself fairly quick and painless] to be sent round the corner for another 15 queue to collect a room key only to be told none were available.

Was for a dance school trip to see the Wizard of Oz. (Wzard of Oz is AMAZING by the way!!!) After a train journey down from the north east we arrived at 10.45am into kings cross & with our show starting at 2.30pm, We had decided a few days before we visited to pre book all 6 rooms as check in from 12pm as this will only cost \u00c2\u00a310 per room (split 2 ways) i tried doing this on their web and as saver room could not amend even though to add something! Rang central res who said to contact hotel, i spoke to the hotel and the staff member said to email conf numbers/names and a CC to secure Early chk in and then will debit on arrival. When we arrived at the receptionn at Drury lane we were advised Whoops! they hadnt been reserved! The receptionist reserved 6 rooms on same floor close by and thought that it had been rectified! we were then asked to go across to the reception at the Holborn building and if rooms were ready we will get them maybe before 12pm We walked over and rooms were not ready and they were not aware of what the other reception had just done, the lady there even said the gentleman that i spoke to on the phone after emailing to confirm they had recieved it was new and he did not know what he was doing!! LOL! she then said if they knew we were coming they would of done our rooms first :-/ was quite a comical conversation! Eventually at 1pm we got 2 rooms on early check in (after changing our girls in the bar area as we were at a show at 2.30pm) paid the \u00c2\u00a320 and then put all bags etc in theose rooms upon return late on that night. There is NO LUGGAGE STORAGE! which stupidly i forgot to check until a few days before going also, As there were 24 of us staying at hotel when i booked initially i should of booked the next night and split the cost so we had somewhere to put bags.... as were were leaving from kings cross at 7.30pm we decided to do the secure bag drop at the station at \u00c2\u00a38.50 per bag. If the above had not happened and check in was smooth then i would of given the hotel 5 out of 5.... ok its not the Ritz but TBH for \u00c2\u00a355 for the room for the night it was more than adequate! especially as it worked out half that for me and my daughter as shared with another mum and daughter! We did opt for the \u00c2\u00a37.95 breakfast in the morning but this was only because 2 kids ate free per adult. It was a good selection of croisants, toasts, yogurts, fruit & cereals. Hot was Sausage, Tomatoes, Bacon, Beans and scrambled eggs. tea coffe and juice too. If we never had the children with us may of ate elsewhere but for that value cant fall off and also was easy with the little ones! We were on floor 5 and my room was 562 which i was a bit worried as right next to the lift shaft but never heard a thing from that, outside noise was a bit louder but being as in a central hotel in London maybe to be expected. One of the girls left their teddy in the room and we only realised when we were at London Zoo on the morning.... it was definitly in there but the cleaners said nothing was there... that was annoying but silly of us for leaving it there..... All in all would i stay here again = yes. recomend it = Yes if it was at the saver rate DEFINITLY! a bit gutted as have booked the London city road TL in jan (stayed at this one few yrs back)as the covent garden was coming up at \u00c2\u00a375.... friends looking to add and covent garden is now on the reduced rate.... shame as the the location is a bit better for walking into covent garden and the west end.....

Of course we got only one big and only one large towel but I asked to a guy who was in charge for two more towels and guess what? In the next days we were getting two pairs of towels. Only thing i didn't like, and because of that I gave 2 out of 5 was bed. I'm a big guy and the mattress was very, very uncomfortable. After 3 days i could sleep more than a few hours because my back were killing me. My girlfriend didn't sleep well also, but much better than me, well she is half my weight.

There was a mistake with our reservation but staff on the reception desk were extremely helpful and nice, they sorted things out for us immediately .

The \"wardrobe\" didn't have doors and there wasn't a bedside table, instead there was a tiny space between the bed and the headboard where you could put an alarm clock or mobile phone but nothing else. The TV was fitted to the wall but the space between the wall and the bed was so small (about 20 cms) that my boyfriend (who is 6 feet tall) couldn't go to the other side of the room without hitting his shoulder.

The room was big, and bathroom spotless.There was a plentiful supply of towels over our 4 night stay, and the room was cleaned each day. The only downside was the noise coming from a nearby nightclub in the early hours - which was in competition with the usual sirens. However, as we were in central London this comes with the territory. As far as value for money's concerned you really can't beat this hotel, particularly if you get a bargain in the Travelodge Sales. Have never stayed in the building at the top of Drury Lane so can't comment on that one. In the 3 times I've now stayed here I've never had to use a tube to get anywhere - it's just so handy for everything. Shopping, museums, theatre, sightseeing - you name it we did it. I've never eaten in the hotel, preferring to use a fab little cafe round the corner for breakfast, and eaten dinner elsewhere. All in all I'll certainly stay here again, and would recommend anyone looking for value for money accomodation. The Hilton it isn't, but it doesn't claim to be!

Our experience of Travelodge's in the main is that they are all of a standard you can expect, basic but clean, comfortable and well located. And this one was indeed well located and clean, but not at all comfortable! The hotel itself is a 5 minute walk from Covent Garden and bus and tube stops, so ideally located for sightseeing, shops, bars and restaurants. The hotel has two buildings, the main one (pictured) and another less glamorous looking building just around the corner. When we say the hotel is not comfortable, it was incredibly warm and as the windows only open a crack we couldn't get any air into the room making it very uncomfortable and difficult to sleep on a warm night. The plumbing also had issues. The pipes were very noisy and when a tap was run or the toilet flushed, the pipes clanked for about 20 mins afterwards! Also the power of the shower was abysmal, just a trickle and nowhere near enough to rinse the shampoo from my hair.

Only then did I notice another sign for 150 (not the one pointing to the lift) which eventually took us to the room, but via a flight of stairs, not a lift. All this at 10:30pm and after a long journey is not what you need. Once in the room, every 5 minutes the door at the end of the corridor banged shut very loudly. Also, being the 1st floor you're quite close to the road, which although looked like a seemingly quiet road was actually very noisy. I kept on having to check the window was still shut at times in the night as you could hear every word passers by said, let alone every passing vehicle. The toilet flush was hopeless and a few hours after finally managing to flush, it all slowly works its way back into the toilet! Absolutely disgusting. I can only hope that it wasn't anybody else's toilet waste in there. As you can imagine, the smell in the bathroom (as the sink drain also stunk) was not nice.

This stay was however a disappointment. The room I stayed in was extremely dated and downright shabby. The bedlinen was clean, and the bed comfortable enough, but the general appearence of the room (eg; scuffed furniture, cracked tiles) and corridors was depressing. There was no net/voile at the window, although it was very much overlooked, and the remote for the tv was AWOL (not that that was a problem, the single room was so small I could reach the tv from the bed quite easily!) The bathroom, although appearing clean on the surface, had the same worn-out, run-down quality. The shower fittings were damaged, but the water pressure and temperature were fine. Thats's the bad, and the ugly, but there is also good. The reception and cafe-bar area has been refurbished and is smart, clean and unfussy.

Room itself was fairly spacious and clean. Towels were like sandpaper, mattress was so soft you sat on it and just sank. TV small for size of room. Room was overlooking busy main road (you are warned about this on the website and we packed earplugs), no blinds/voile or any thing other than curtains to give you privacy so these had to be closed. Room unbearably hot so had to have windows open but then too noisy to sleep. Even with windows closed and ear plugs in, the noise was too great for any sleep. We were supposed to stay 2 nights but checked out after one and I got a refund with no problem, we'd paid in advance. The price for the first night was ok considering the location but the second night was double the price (presume because of Wimbledon).

I would stay here again if desperate (would ask for a room away from road) and was on a cheap deal but for the second night, the charge was \u00c2\u00a3145.

Not the prettiest of hotels but perfect for tourists who just need a base to sleep. Great location near Covent Garden. Check in ------------ There were a couple of self-check in machines available if you had booked on-line. i had a few issues with reception as they wanted to charge me for the room but this was a mixup between our company booking system and them I think. I asked if they had a map they could give me and I was told it was in the other building??? My room was through into the other building (but didn't find any maps) They could very easily just print out an A4 local map and leave in rooms or reception for guests to take) Room --------- Room was really quite large (compared to some hotels) very comfy bed. Basic room with an unexceptional view facing another building so I had no daylight and couldn't open my curtains as everyone could see straight in. No wardrobe just a small rail (which is fine if you're just staying a couple of nights) Bathroom was obviously recently refurbished as it was spotless, no niceties just a small bar of soap. Again fine if you have your own with you. I never use hotel hairdryers as I usually find them to be too basic but there wasn't one in the room anyway! (Assume you could have got one from reception if you needed one) However from a working woman's point of view the plug socket was on the desk but there was no mirror there, the mirror was about 20 feet away so it was quite difficult to see if you wanted to dry your hair, I did ask at reception for an extension lead but was told they didn't have any. Again something really simple to fix by putting in a small mirror over the desk. (Maybe they assume guests don't bother drying their hair?)

Our room was on the first floor (61) The windows had blackout type windows and curtains which was great as there were cafes and offices directly opposite. Room was clean and spacious - everything looked like new, bed was comfy, bathroom was a little small for my liking but it did the job. Only one towel was provided for a double room so we had to ask at reception for more but staff were happy to help! Great location...... just around the corner is Covent Garden market itself. lots of shops, cafes and resturaunts all just minutes up the street also the nearest tube station High Holburn. Room was pretty noisey from traffic and people throughout the night and first thing, but being right on the lane and on the first floor this could not be helped and didnt really bother us.

There was no housekeeping service to do this and no telephones in the rooms to call down and request anything. Room 349 had a new carpet fitted while we stayed and the furniture from that room was piled in front of the emergency exit, blocking the exit completely. Dirty towels and linen were piled up in the corridor and were collected only late in the afternoon.

The jewel in the crown for me was the great location - you are just a 5 min walk from Holburn underground station, which is just a hop and a skip into the main sightseeing areas - by underground or foot for that matter. And if you really want to extend the good value, note that Holburn is on the Picadilly line, so you actually could get a tube all the way in to the hotel from Heathrow much more reasonably than making taxi/train connections.

This review relates to my stay in the Holborn/ Museum Street site (the tower block) and not the Drury Lane site (with the steep steps up). The mixed reviews on Tripadvisor about this hotel may be attributable to some of the Drury Lane site rooms having been refurbished (from what I can gather). Both sites operate as one hotel but with separate receptions apparently. Anyway, I have stayed at this hotel in the past, albeit some time ago shortly after it had been refurbished. I would say that this site is quite badly in need of another refurbishment, or at least major re-painting and deep cleaning. It's starting to look a little worse for wear these days as evidenced by marked walls, cracked sink, stained carpets and so on. The room heater was fairly ineffective and the window didn't open (broken catch). You get what you pay for; it's basic and fairly clean. Aside from the cosmetic issues I also found some other problems in evidence. Staff generally appeared hard pressed and stressed. Unfortunately reception staff in general presented as sullen (no smiles at all) and I did have the feeling that any requests made of them were considered troublesome. On one occasion, with four members of staff located behind reception, they appeared to be able to deal with only one guest collectively. Two self check-in machines located in reception (and occupying much space) appeared to be non-functioning. Breakfast on the morning of the royal wedding was a bit of a rugby scrum; tables uncleared, guests queuing up etc, staff thin on the ground. The overall impression was a lack of coordination, stressed staff with low motivation and no visible management providing a feeling that someone was in control. Regrettably this Travelodge has acquired the feeling of a hostel at some point along the way. The experience was not totally awful, but it could be made a lot better. On the plus side, the location is very good and when they decide to undertake a refurbishment of the hotel I would probably come back but in the meantime I would probably look elsewhere first. Would I recommend to a friend? It depends on the friend I guess!

I actually prefer Premier Inns, but their rates were very expensive, so I booked the Travelodge for two nights at \u00c2\u00a370 a night, which was very reasonable for London. The location wasn't quite Covent Garden, as it advertises, but is only a short walk a way, and is convenient for both buses and the superb, fantastic London Underground (yeah I work for them...:-)) station of Holborn. We actually wandered into the reception area of the new building, was seen to straight away and given our room card for the building opposite. (The older building) On walking across the road to the older building, we saw that their reception was about 6 people deep, and they looked swamped, so I was quite glad we'd gone to the new building first. We went to the lifts, there were two, and one wasn't working. In fact it did start working later in the day, but they must've got about 2 hours out of it, as it soon broke down again, which meant the whole 7 or so floors were using one lift. We were on the 5th floor. Aside from that, everything was fine. The room was your standard Travelodge room, the bed wasn't as comfortable as some Travelodges I've stayed in, but after two nights on the drink, I hardly noticed it! Reception were helpful enough when we asked for a second keycard, and as with any Travelodge, there is minimal contact with staff anyway. All in all, a good all round stay, and when we want to stay in London again, I will definitely check the rates for this Travelodge.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "west yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cBasic\u201d", "Author": "poppy57", "ReviewID": "UR105826806", "Content": "The hotel is as expected, basic but clean and well maintained.

I wouldnt recomend getting a breakfast as its not very good quality and their are plenty of places near by to get something to eat.

Any location in central London would have the same problem. There is absolutely no noise from within the building. The complaints about awful rooms seem to all be related to the Drury Lane building. The way to ensure that you get a room in the Holborn building is to book a family room, as they are all in that building. The price is the same as for a double, and you get a queen-size bed and a pullout sofa. We do not use the pullout, but the sofa gives us a place to sit.

Surly staff greet you at the reception and point you in the direction of the check-in machine - which will not entertain a check-in until 3pm. The room was very difficult to find and required lugging our suitcase down several flights on stairs and around corners. Okay for my but for elderly people no fun at all. The room was breathtakingly depressing. Grimy, dingy, stains on the ceiling, no telephone to contact reception, no bedside tables, no toiletries other than one wafer thin bit of soap which was still thicker than the pillows on the bed. The bathroom stank. There was constant noise from the hen night staying next door. One set of towels between two people. The bed displayed the most spectacular example of roll-together known to man. We managed one night here before getting out the credit card and treating ourselves to staying somewhere decent. It was either that or have the whole weekend blighted by this appalling hotel.

We also had to hurdle over dirty sheets in the corridors and on the stairs which were just abandoned in large piles.

When we arrived, we were literally pointed to a machine to check in, which I suppose was fine, but a bit better customer support would have been nice. While checking in, we were offered the option of a breakfast buffet, which sounded nice so we took this option. This proved a terrible idea as the breakfast was not advertised as a continental. In fact, when we did go for our breakfast, there weren't any plates out to even put our food on. There were a few pastries, some old looking fruit, and a few pots of yogurt. My husband was so disappointed, the he didn't even touch his coffee and insisted we go somewhere else for a proper breakfast. But back to the check in experience. We were told from the main counter that our room was on Drury Lane, which was fine, but after spending 20 minutes searching for our room in this building which was under construction, we were finally told that it was 'outside and to the left'. This was even the wrong information and so after walking outside with all our luggage up and down steps in the snow, we crossed paths with a member of staff from the main building on High Holborn. We asked her where our room was, and she said 'inside'. So at this point, we insisted that we be shown to our room as the directions in broken English were getting a bit redundant. (outside, left, right, inside, etc.) Once we found our room, and went in, there was one towel for the two of us to share, though we specified two people staying and someone had helped themselves to our tea, leaving their mess in the bin before we arrived. The heater in the room was not working properly, which we did not realize until the next day. The thermostat stated 29 degrees, but I would estimate it never budged over 20. The shower was a nice power shower, but water went all over the floor with the curtain fully closed. Also, there was a half roll of toilet paper which was not replaced, so we were required to ration it to ourselves. All in all, this was a horrible stay and the value for the money was absolute rubbish! We will never EVER stay in a Travelodge again and have told all of our friends about this experience.

Neither of the bins had been emptied, mirrors in both the bathroom and bedroom were manky with finger prints all over them, Bath had black gunky-mouldy stuff in it ( Im not sure what it was but I can safely say it probably shouldnt have been there). The taps were covered in a dust and there was hairs in the sink. The sheets had a series of odd stains on them including one kind of lumpy stain. The pull out bed had the most disgusting mattress I have ever seen with two HUGE big stains, one white coloured rimmed one and another one quite similar in size but darker in colour. The hotel itself is in the middle of getting works done to it but this was not explained at the time of booking. To get into the hotel you have to go up these set of steps outside which leads you then down through this little gap which is between the hotel and the building site, I presume. The staff we met (only those who worked on reception) were absolutely lovely and I cannot fault them in any way. We complained and got moved to the Travelodge across the road to another family room which was nice and clean and served us well. As we were only spending one night in London we were extremely disappointed in our choice of accomodation. We booked that Travelodge for a number of reasons, the main one was its location to the theatres but it was also because we had stayed in Travelodges in London and in Ireland before and they were grand. We were especially disappointed in this because this Travelodge had been found and booked through a visit london tourist website. As a tourism student myself I was appalled at the fact that I had booked this on a site that was recommending it as accomodation to visitors.

Was really happy from when we first arrived, all the staff we came across were friendly and some extremely helpful. Public areas very clean, no matter what time we were in the lift area it smelt freshly cleaned...3 lifts all very clean too. Rooms, really basic, but this is a budget hotel (we paid \u00c2\u00a355 per night for a family room), and yes, some walls did have marks on them, but a hotel in the city would have to decorate once a week to stop this from happening. Above all though (and my main concern after a recent trip to another London Travelodge-Kings Cross Royal Scot) was that the rooms, and especially the bathroom, were pristine. Beds comfortable with immaculate bedding. Location is FANTASTIC, minutes away from the nearest tube (with most tourist destinations within a 10 minute journey), few minutes walk from Leicester Sq, Soho, museums etc with some amazing restaurants and bars (not that we made use of the bars on this trip with the kids!). We bought a daily travel pass for just over \u00c2\u00a35 each (unlimited buses and tube rides...kids free) but didn't really have to use them that much. There is a swimming pool straight across the road which costs \u00c2\u00a34 for adults and just \u00c2\u00a31 for children, open til 9pm every night. Also an Aveda spa opposite which I didn't get the chance to use, but will definately try out next time (presume you'd have to book a while in advance?) Breakfast cost us \u00c2\u00a37.50 per adult but the children are free...all you can eat buffet...full English, cereals, continental. Area for food is very small but managable, and food was hot, well cooked and reguarly topped up. There were a few niggles, that would stop me giving it 5 stars...although it was close! No plug in bath, had to ask house keeping. No hairdryers, but can get one from reception, could do with more pillows (1 each...sure we could of asked for more though) and basic tv choices (bit of a pain in the evenings after the kids have gone to sleep), nothing major...and definately nothing to worry about...just thought i'd put all of the facts down.

We were given a key to the room on high Holborn but the mattress was so old, springs were showing through and we rolled into the centre of it because it was so soft and un-supporting. We decided to go for the original room because there is no way I would have let a dog sleep on the mattress at high Holborn. We ended up sleeping top and tail because you still fell into the centre of the bed because of how old it was.

We were given room 719 which had slightly quieter neighbours! All rooms we saw were shabby, old and quite dirty. The lifts felt like they were ready to break at any point and the service light was on one of them and they all made loud banging noises at random times going up and down.

I would not rush to book this hotel again and I most certainly would not pay more than \u00c2\u00a340 per night. At full price of \u00c2\u00a3100+ per night, you could stay at much nicer places in the west end (e.g. a couple of the thistle hotels are about \u00c2\u00a3100 - \u00c2\u00a3110 per night).

Asked for an iron which when taking back up to the room leaked all over my dress and then had to dry it out luckily it was like a sauna in the room so dried quickly. Went back down to get a hairdryer and some ice. The ice was given to me in a plastic bag, i did ask if I could have it in a pint glass and was told she had run out of glasses!

I guess it depends on what night it is and which side of the hotel you are on, next night was not as bad, quitened down not long after midnight. The room we had was basic, a very large space where they obviously put in a second bed if needed, but there was only 1 char in the whole room !! Seemed clean but I did get the impression some wee bugs were flying round that room and we did get some bites, another thing that would really make me doubt I would go back. Then just a quick note on which building of the hotel to take, we were in the Holburn Road one, think it's the taller of the 2 and slightly further from Covent Garden tube, this did seem the better hotel to get and indeed knowing that we pre-booked a room, which they were very happy to do, I had also asked for a quiter room, which is even more suprising considering the noise problem mentioned above", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland", "Title": "\u201cBasic but good value for money, more than made up by brilliant location\u201d", "Author": "Poopsiethecow", "ReviewID": "UR66267050", "Content": "We booked this in advance from Australia on the Travelodge website, and paid 55 pounds per night for two nights.

Yes, the room was a bit shabby and needed some maintenance but was clean. My room was a single with a single bed but in a previous incarnation had been a double room (it had a double headboard) so there was plenty of space. Bed was comfortable, room had a wardrobe, tea/coffee making facilities, flat screen tv, a heater, a very old a/c unit that only seemed to blow out warm air (not a problem as it was not warm in London that night so room did not need cooling); I do wonder what the room would be like in summer as you can only open the window about an inch. Terrible view from my particular room (see photo). Bathroom clean but worn at the edges with cracked/loose tiles but otherwisee OK. You are supplied with one small bar of soap and nothing else so bring your own shower gel/shampoo. You get one hand towel and one bath towel per person but no bath mat to step on as you exit the shower. Shower was powerful and hot. I had some sort of air vent near my window which 'hummed' so slept with window closed, noise level was fine. In the morning opened the window and aroma of bacon wafted into my room.

There is also a bar within the hotel, which was a nice option on our last night when we had to pack but still wanted a few more beers.

It sits on top of an NCP where you get half price parking if you take a car as we did. There is a Dominos pizza 10 yards from the entrance if you need. The bar and eating area is light, bright and in very good order, we had 2 rooms on floor 9, both rooms were large and exactly what you would expect from a Travelodge. Both were clean, spacious, good views and offered a good nights sleep. Breakfast was very good, plenty of everything. The other hotel which we poppoed in to look at having read other reviews, immediately made us feel relieved that we were not staying there. It felt dark, cramped, old and scruffy, it was also very very close to some clubs, easy to see where the noise issue would come from. In short, if you want luxury pay a lot more and stay else where.

Our daughter and husband had arrived the previous evening, having also paid over \u00c2\u00a3100 per night. They had to ask to be moved because the room they were given was smelly and not fit for occupation. We were slightly apprehensive after their experience. When we arrived at about 10.30pm it was immediately obvious that there was a problem with getting a room, since it took half an hour for us to be allocated a room, which happened to be in the other building. When we arrived at the other building our keys didn't work, and we found out that the lock was broken. We were eventually offered another room which was in the basement and completely unheated. We refused to stay there, since we were aware that we had paid over the odds for our room and were being offered an unheated room in an unheated corridor. After ONE AND A HALF HOURS we eventually landed up back in the room with the broken lock, and were told the lock would be sorted in the morning, which it was. The room itself was adequate, but not of the standard we would expect for the money we had paid. The staff were pleasant, and not to blame for the inefficient and unfair method of allocating rooms. We spoke to the manageress in the morning, expecting some sort of financial compensation for the inconvenience, since by that time, having heard conversations between staff and guests, we were aware that we had paid way over the normal rate for our room. She refused this, saying that the policy was \"first come, first served\". When I pointed out that we had indeed been first-come since Travelodge had had our money for over 4 months, the policy for allocating rooms was quoted again. When we were e-mailed a general questionnaire by Travelodge asking about our experience, I told them, and asked for a response. I have never received this, so the questionnaire was pointless. My advice to anyone would be that this is a very central hotel, handy for theatres, tube etc. However, don't pay over \u00c2\u00a3100 a night as we did, because you may arrive to see signs quoting rooms for less than \u00c2\u00a320, and then realise that people paying the cheap prices may well have the best rooms.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marple", "Title": "\u201cNot the Ritz,but reasonable for the price.\u201d", "Author": "Alan_Maxted", "ReviewID": "UR62995988", "Content": "Stayed with my wife for two nights whilst I was making a visit to Great Queen St. The cost was about \u00c2\u00a3150 for both of us for the two nights including breakfast booked online.The ensuite room was basic and clean, but no furnishings at all except for a dressing table/mirror, I hard chair and a tv..,two cups and a kettle with coffe and tea There was plenty of room for a table and two sitting chairs, it would have made the room much more pleasant, although the bed was soft it was it comfortable.

Check in was fine, if a little slow, and the room was clean and spacious. The curtains were hanging downbut that would not affect a stay. It was noticed the traffic noise for a room at the back ot the hotel appeared rather loud and on checking to see if the window was open it could be seen the fit of the double glazed window left a lot to be desired, it was draughty round the seal and therefore did not block out sound. But again the level of traffic noise would have ben acceptable. However come 12 midnight a club opened directly at the side/rear of the hotel, music was not too bad but bass beat was quite noticeable, what was a big problem was the clientele of the club who stood in the street shouting, screaming and swearing. On Saturday this went on until 5.00 a.m, on Sunday night and Monday night until around 3.00 a.m. This is not \"some noise disruption\" as described in the hotel \"blurb\" This is not a cheap hotel where you would say \"you get what you pay for\".

My flight got me into London very early in the morning and although my confirmation said check in wasnt till 3pm i tried chancing my arm and arrived at 9am only to be told by a very pleasant friendly receptionist to come back at 12pm as there were no rooms available at the moment. Fair enough, but no left luggage facility which means you either have to carry your bags about London with you or find an alternative facility at one of the main Stations. Arrived back at 5pm after a days sightseeing and was checked in no problem and given my key. Again staff were really friendly and was advised that my room was in the High Holborn building approx 30 seconds walk along the road from the Drury Lane building. This was a fairly modern building which looks like an old converted office block. There was a sitting area in the lobby with vending machines selling confectionery, drinks and coffee and a bar and restaurant. My room was no 262 on the second floor which was a good size for london standards. As expected it was basic with a double bed, open plan wardrobe and shelving, flat screen tv, bathroom and kettle with tea and coffee. The room was clean and pretty modern but had no air conditioning or phone. I never use the phones in hotels but i still think this is an esential piece of equipment for hotel rooms in case of unwanted visitors or emergencies. From a security point of view I found it strange that you were unable to contact reception from your room. There is no room service in this hotel although there is a reasonably good selection of hot food available from the restaurant and you are able to order your food down at the bar and take it back to your room if you want. The hotel is on a very busy 4 lane road and the noise during the night was awful. I can usually sleep wherever i go but woke about 5 times during the night due to non stop traffic noise and boisterous clubbers walking past. Even at 06:30 in the morning folk were still heading home from the clubs etc and insisted on shouting loudly. I know theres not really a lot the hotel can do about this as all windows are double glazed but i think it is an important factor to take into account when considering whether or not to stay here.

After reading the reviews here, I arrived with ear plugs for the expected night club noise, and low expectations. Firstly, if you take the tube and get off at Holborn, come out and head towards the Sainsburys. Continue along that street (High Holborn-it bears left) for about 3 blocks. Down Drury Lane is one of the TL buildings, and on High Holborn is the other, newer building. I checked in at Drury Lane but to my relief, my room was in the High Holborn building. I suspect the family rooms are in that one, which I had booked, before my friend pulled out of the trip. So it may not hurt to book a family room if you want that building- but that's just my suspicion. Anyway, I had a room on the first floor (2nd floor for Americans), which faced the road. High Hoborn is a very busy street yet it was quiet! It's a standard TL room with no frills, but it was very clean. They had made up the sofa bed with the linen for the (absent) 2nd guest which was nice. (I felt kind of bad though, since I didn't use it) The bathroom was clean (with a huge towel!!) , and the bed comfy. The flat screen tv was nice too. I heard no noise either night from any nightclub that people on here have mentioned - maybe I just got lucky. On the second leg of my trip, I had a family room on the 2nd floor, facing another building, so it was even quieter. I had the buffet breakfast, as well. (7.5 pounds) It was perfectly fine- bacon (Canadian style), eggs, sausages, toast, cereals, muffins, coffee, juices, etc . The first morning I headed down about 9:30 am and there was no wait, though the room was almost full. The second time, I arrived around 8:30 and there was a queue of about 10 people so I headed to a Costa coffee around the corner instead. In the cafe at the TL there are 2 pay per use computers- 1 pound for 30 min. Also a couple vending machines scattered throughout the hotel. It seems the High Holborn building is the better of the two. Beware, Holborn is a very busy tube stop, so travelling to/from Heathrow at rush hour could be precarious and there are some stairs involved. That said, I would absolutely stay there again!

However, having stayed at many a Travelodge, my expectations were at the right level; I knew there was no phone, toiletries, trouser press or the other plethera of extras that you usually pay for and never use. I did phone ahead and request a room in the newer High Holborn building (as opposed to the older building set back on Drury Lane), and the room was perfectly adequate - clean, large and bright, and warm. Reception staff were polite and helpful (request for extra bedding and towels was complied with quickly) and the room was cleaned well during the day with new towels supplied and tea/coffee/cups replenished (we left a note for housekeeping in the room just to make sure!) So, basically - do your research. If you go expecting all the bells and whistles of a four star hotel, you will be disappointed and will probably have a bit of a whinge on this site. Go with the right expectations, and you will find a good welcoming hotel, in an excellent location, at a decent price.

I had to kneel on the loo to do my makeup! Everything did look clean though. We left our bag in the room and went to ask to be moved to another room,however there was a massive queue and only 1 person on reception. As we wanted to get out and see the sights and only had 1 night, we decided to put up with the room. We returned at 11 pm after an easy walk from the theatre. We had a drink (bar prices were ok) and then went to bed. We couldn't sleep for the road noise and we thought the window (12 inches by 30 inches) must be open as there was a terrible draught. It turned out that the window was closed but didn't fit properly so we had to stuff a pillow into the window recess which did help the noise and cold draught. We could still hear police sirens outside and the bed was too soft for us (although I do realise everyone has their own preference with mattresses). We were woken at 5.15 am by the fire alarm and had to try to dress quickly in the doorway as there wasn't enough room to dress by the bed!! Fortunately it was a false alarm.

We checked into the High Holborn Travelodge as opposed to the Drury Lane building having read that this was the newer of the two 'Lodges'. In the light of the experience of other we asked for a bright and quiet room. The reception staff members were very friendly and accommodating and gave us a room on the 12th floor with excellent views towards the BT tower and Centre Point. During the night we could hear a little noise from High Holborn through the double glazing but we expected as much in a central London location. The room was spacious and clean, the double bed large and quite comfortable and the furniture basic but functional. The bathroom was spotless and although I'm not keen on showers over baths it did offer options. Having been forwarned that shampoo etc. were not generally available, we came suitably equipped and for one night that wasn't a problem. The television worked and the coffee making facilities were fine even though we missed the usual shortbread biscuits! Having been pleased with the room, we waited to be disappointed by breakfast but we couldn't fault it. Breakfast was available from 7.00 until 10.00 and we attended at 9.00. The tables were clean and used trays and plates cleared promptly by smiling and helpful staff. The full english breakfast items were hot and well presented with staff on hand throughout. It was an unhurried affair ( perhaps because it was a Monday ) and we enjoyed our meal. Available on an 'eat as much as you like' basis, breakfast proved to be good value.

My room was very clean and modern with comfortable double bed, small bathroom with shower (no bath), flat screen wall mounted TV and air con. I arrived quite late and was told my room was on a lower floor with small window. The window looked into an underground carpark that was lit 24 hrs which didn't hinder my sleep, but never knew what the weather was like in a morning! Didn't bother me but others may not like it. Avoid the \u00c2\u00a37.50 all you can eat breakfast! Sounds great but had to queue to get a table, then queued and had to hang around for food to be replenished! There were no cereals, teabags, milk, cups, and croissants and muffins had all gone by 9am. When I asked for cups and tea bags - took forever! Restaurant is far too small to cope with demand. Save money and go to the coffee shop right opposite for a freshly cooked breakfast and tea or coffee for \u00c2\u00a34.50. Nowhere to store luggage. Ridiculous in central London Location is fantastic! Turn right and and you are a few minutes walk from Covent Garden, turn left and you are a five minute walk from Shaftesbury Ave, China Town and Piccadilly. WiFi vouchers were available at reception for use on their computers in the bar area. Irons, ironing boards and hairdryers were free of charge and just needed to be returned to reception within 2 hours. Room service menu available - didn't use this but prices seemed pretty reasonable but there are loads of great places to eat on the hotels doorstep.

You check in at the older building which is around the corner from the newer building on Drury Lane. We stayed in the newer building, you don't get a choice though so we had no idea until we got there. However the older building looked fine too. There were dining facilities at the hotel from 5pm until 10.30pm but we were never back early enough to try them! There seemed to be plenty of choice on the menu though. Breakfast is served from 7am until 10am and consists of hot and cold items including cereals, toast, tea, coffee, various juices and a traditional english breakfast, perfect to set you up for the day. Bear in mind it is cheaper to book breakfast when you book the room as you save around 20% on the cost of breakfast. In the reception area there are vending machines selling snacks, drinks and various toiletries too. It's the location of this hotel which makes it an excellent choice, it's situated in Covent Garden and in my opinion it's unbeatable! There is so much to do right on your doorstep, with so many shops, bars, and cafes around every corner! Theatre land is literally across the road on Shaftsbury avenue. It is a 5 to 10mins walk at the most to the Strand, Piccadilly circus and leicester square. Covent garden tube station is a few minutes from the hotel and Euston station is a 10 to 15min walk. I've heard some people complaining about the noise in the area, but we honestly didn't really notice anything. Granted we were out late most nights and when we did get to bed you could hear the traffic outside and people in general but it didn't effect us or our stay at all. We stayed during the week and it wasn't a cheap, cheap hotel as we paid just over \u00c2\u00a3100 per night. But nowhere is cheap in London and I think it was worth the price just for the location alone. Over all we can't fault our stay and loved the location so much we've booked this same hotel again for another trip in December!", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "York, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and spotless room\u201d", "Author": "bee12399", "ReviewID": "UR39143701", "Content": "Having in number of hotels in central and greater london the best thing about this hotel was certainly the location; right on the edge of covent garden, 2 blocks to covent garden tube, 1 block to holborn tube, tons of fab restaurants, bars and of course the theatres right on your doorstep.

Some of the hot food was cold, but the quality of the products themselves was very very poor. Think the cheapest quality meat possible and that comes close. My favourite part of the stay was a small fire in the cigarette bin outside. The bar manager shouted out 'fire' to at least 4 people, until someone who looked like a manager took notice. Instead of doing the sensible thing and grabbing a fire extinguiser she vanished into the kitchen for a few minutes to get a pint jug full of water!

The one time we let the phone ring out for 7 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c someone eventually answered but immediately hung up.

When we got to the room, there was only one bath towel and one hand towel for two guests. As there was no phone in the room, I had to go down to reception to request more towels. I also told them about the soaking wet carpet that was so wet it was squelching but no one came to have a look, and there was no other room available so I requested more towels to put on the floor so we could actually walk on it. I have no idea what was on the carpet but the liquid was brown and it came through 3 bath towels that I laid down. I also reported the smell of sewage. The mattress was completely worn out. It was like lying on a soft sponge, which aggravated my back and cost me a decent night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The room was too small and too hot (no air con). We had a drink in the bar later (which was also the breakfast area) when I noticed another guest also requesting another towel.

At that point I decided to refrain from having breakfast there, and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to check out.

I dressed and went down to reception with wet hair to ask if they could loan me a hairdryer. The girl loaned me a hairdryer for 2 hours and asked if there was anything else she could do for me. I let her know that the wardrobe door was missing, at which time she fetched the manager. She asked if she could come up to the room to look for herself. When we got to the room she looked at the wardrobe and simply asked \"did you want a door then?\" I replied that all I expect is that the furniture and fittings in the room be in tact. She told me that it would have been a mirrored door and was probably cracked so they would have removed it and that I shouldn't have tried to use the hairdryer as there was a sign saying to request one from reception. There was no sign. She then said with a very bad attitude that if I was going to complain, I should bare this in mind and also remember that it is a budget hotel!

I dont think you can complain about street noise when you stay in a hotel in a city centre, particularly in London, and I agree with an earlier reviewer - try Rome if you want noise at night! But when the majority of the noise comes from the hotel itself, its much easier to feel angry. I spent one night there (a Wed night) and was happy that I had been offered a room on the 7th floor (well away from the street noise I thought). Unfortunately I had a constant noise all night from what I can only imagine was the building air conditioning unit (if such a thing exists on a building that old and dilapidated) and then another exceptionally loud noise from what I think might have been a boiler starting up early in the morning. As for the hotel and the room itself - I booked through the website and the building and rooms looked nice. Whoever took the external photo is obviously a Photoshop genius, since it paints a much nicer picture than the reality offers. Since I was a lone traveller I booked a standard double room, but when I got to my room it only contained a single bed. There was no shower gel, no sign of an iron/board anywhere, a tiny slit-like window, old carpet and marked walls. I've stayed in better student halls in the past and would have been unimpressed if I had been offered this room in a hostel at a tenth the price. So I was pretty disappointed to have paid \u00c2\u00a3100 for the privilege, espcially given the constant noise all night. This area of London is not short of hotels - although admittedly most are more expensive, but anything is worth the extra comapred to this hotel. Travelodge need to sort their act out and redecorate this hotel so that it actually looks like the rooms in the photos on their website. What makes it worse (no, really, it does get worse) is that you cant check in until 3pm and have to pay an extra \u00c2\u00a310 to check in early. I would have avoided doing so, but there is no luggage storage facility in the hotel (apparently due to security concerns), so you either carry your bags with you all day or pay the extra. Next thing you know they will be charging an extra \u00c2\u00a31 to get into the toilet in your roomand \u00c2\u00a35 for a shower!

He proceeded to tell me that the only way I could get a cab was to pre-pay for it and he happy to dial that number for me! Fortunately, I happened to know that was completely untrue. Also, do not buy time on the Internet expecting to use it at your leisure during your stay. The hour has to be used continuously and its \u00c2\u00a310 per hour. Starbucks has a better deal than that. We were shoved in the old part of this hotel in Covent Garden proper. There was no elevator (although their were elevators in the other two buildings, which we were forced to explore while looking for our room). The room was tiny and windows and walls were extremely thin. I felt extremely \"exposed\" both nights here as our room faced the constantly busy court yard. There were sirens pretty much non stop, ruffians hanging out in the court yard, and other patrons loudly stumbling through the halls. I mean, I get it, it is cheap (for London). But it isn't so cheap that you should expect staff to be incompetent and to be kept up all night by noises outside. I fully recognize it is a City Centre. . . but that should be the hotel's clue to install double or triple pain windows. Also, there was no iron in the room --- why not just pin it down like they did the hair dryer or hangers? The Premier Inn chain and may other hotels in Britain don't have irons in the room but have them in common areas. At Travelodge you have to wait in cue, take the iron (and potentially an extremely large board) upstairs and then back down to reception.

We were looking for a place that was clean, affordable, and with a good location to sleep after a day of sight-seeing. For these points Travelodge delivered. The hotel is made up of two seperate buildings across the street from each other--we stayed on the 7th floor in the High Holborn building. - Great location! We walked everywhere. And if we hadn't wanted to walk, the tube stops for Covent Garden, Leicester Square, and Holborn were all within a few mintues walk. Within five minutes of many theaters, the British Museum, and lots of decent restaurants. - Clean, simple rooms - including the bathrooms. And pretty spacious from what I understand about other London hotels. TV and water boiler + instant coffee/tea. On the flip side, simple means there are no toiletries (except for a little bar of soap), and that you have to borrow the hairdryer/iron from the front desk and return them when you're done. Also, no phones in the rooms. Internet for a fee. - The staff was polite and helpful in our experience.

Firstly the price- I paid \u00c2\u00a319 a night. Location excellent. In fact I ended up walking to Piccadilly and Westminster; it's so well placed. Went to a couple of shows-Piccadilly and Drury Lane, both of which were near. I went alone and did not feel that after leaving the theatres that I was unsafe, even in the underground Stations. It was busy like it was early evening.Just use your sense around the Capital. I kept my handbag tightly under my arm, and my mobile out of sight. I did not eat at the hotel, but if I did want a snack, 'Subway' was a couple of yards down the road, as was various other coffee places, offering breakfast etc. There is an Indian restaurant and a Thai one opposite.Also, there is a chemist opposite and a convenience store, so you are well provided for!! Covent Garden station, which was 7 mins away, had an M&S with foodhall opposite so that was handy for teh odd thing. The staff were great and helpful. The first room (3rd floor)I had was fantastic and modern (see pics) but unfortunately i had to move as the window was very draughty. The 2nd room (7th floor) was not as plush, but clean and adequate and warm. Reading a previous comment, yes there are 2 buildings. I was in the one on Drury Lane, next to a dental practice. The other is the other side of the road next to Shaftesbury Avenue.Maybe the rooms were better in my building, I can't say, but certainly they weren't dirty.I know the staff would be happy to move you if you are not satisfied. My building has it's own car park underneath and is \u00c2\u00a315 a day, which I thought was v. reasonable. I will bear that in mind for next time.I used the underground and buses (buses are great for when you have luggage or are tired as it saves all the steps, walking and escalators that face you in underground stations). I got a one day travelcard which was great value, not a lot of diff. between that and the 3 day one. can be used for buses or the tube.

This represents the most basic of hotel accomodation and, for \u00c2\u00a3105, was frankly appalling. Travelodge even had the audacity to suggest that by not supplying complimentary extras, they could save money and then pass this saving onto customers.

You needed a key to access the elevators, so I'd say security is probably NOT an issue. But what seals the deal here is the incredible location.

We weren't expecting much going over after reading the reviews here etc but we were pleasantly surprised. We checked in the High Holborn entrance after reading that that was the newer building. As others have said, the hotel is basic but clean. They didn't have a double room left for us when we checked in (granted it was almost 11pm) but gave us a family room for the 4 nights. I think it was basically the same as a double room but bigger and had a big couch in it. The couch was old and scruffy and dirty looking but luckily we only used it as a clothes hanger! The bed was about a queen size I'd say so plenty big. Very soft but I found that very comfortable. It was very close to the ground for some reason though but not a big deal. We had enough towels for the 2 of us but if they were to do any more people I don't think we wouldn't have had enough. The bed was made each day and the bathroom lightly cleaned. One day they forgot to restock the teabags like another poster but I just got some from the breakfast area. The only real gripe I have is that the cleaners were knocking at our door at 9am on the day we were due to check out trying to get into the room to clean. Check out is not until 12pm and to add insult to injury I had booked a late checkout and paid an extra \u00c2\u00a310 to stay until 2pm. It is a major bugbear of mine when hotels do this so I complained to reception and I was first of all told it much have been another guest knocking on the wrong door (it wasn't, I opened the door with a very sleepy head and saw the cleaners!) and then I was given an apology of sorts. The hotel was extremelly busy with the bank holiday and the queue for breakfast each morning was quite long. We had not booked breakfast as I am not one to eat too much in the mornings and refuse to pay \u00c2\u00a37.50 for a slice of toast and cup of tea but instead chose to go with the recommendation of going to a nearby cafe which I'm glad about as the breakfast looked awful in the hotel. There is Cafe Ola and Franz Cafe 2 mins walk to the right of the hotel which both do lovely breakfasts for about \u00c2\u00a35 for a full english. Much better quality than was being served in the hotel. Also on the street you walk down to get to Covent Garden tube station there are lovely trendy cafe's. The hotel is located midway between Holborn and Covent Garden tube stops. (turn right for Covent Garden and left for Holborn when you come out of the hotel) You can get the picadilly line at either and the central line at Holborn. Less than 10 mins walk to either. It is a more pleasant walk to Covent Garden stop as you pass shops/cafes however they don't have escalators here (just a big lift or hundreds of stairs) and it gets really really busy so we used Holborn a lot for handiness. \u00c2\u00a35.30 will get you a day ticket for the tube that you can use all day. It's about 25/30 mins walk to Picadilly Circus. The rooms don't have an iron/hairdryer. You can borrow both from reception but they don't have that many. They'll give you an iron and ironing board for 2 hours. We were unlucky in that the room accross from us were quite noisy but we were barely there and they didn't disturb our sleep.

The hotel itself could do with a wee bit of a kick to make it better (e.g. vending machines and computers out of order the entire time we were there, room keys failing to work a lot, staff not exactly fast or chirpy and they actually got a bit confused at one point knocking on our door to try to charge us extra - think it was a mistake as they never came back! so keep your confirmation till you leave!). However it was absolutely perfect for us and I would stay here the next time I am in london as the location is the best of anywhere i have stayed in the city before. If you are not on holiday for the hotel, stay here! oh and breakfast was \u00c2\u00a37.50 for an all you can eat (we didnt have it although it smelled fabulous - sure they pumped the smell into tthe lifts to entice you down!) but there are some great breakfast places around about (e.g Ola to the right of the hotel and a place down Drury Lane) for much cheaper!", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cGreat 'budget' London hotel\u201d", "Author": "JonaNottingham", "ReviewID": "UR10413415", "Content": "If you have stayed in a Travelodge you will know what to expect...good, clean, no frills rooms and this is exactly what we got.

We had booked family rooms (double plus small pullout) but the receptionist advised us on arrival to take a standard room with a zed bed as the bed was better and was already made up. We did this and it was fine (kids shared the doubles). I was impressed bt the size of the rooms - huge for London. We were on the top floor (floor 13) which I would advise if possible as it is probably quieter (although there were quite a few police sirens on one night). We had views out over the city to St Pauls, Tower Bridge etc. We paid for breakfast when we booked on the web...good value as kids eat free. Quality of the food no the best but good for saving time. The cafe bar is small and we had to wait on both days (but there were six of us) but for no more then 5 mins. In terms of location...it's less than 10 mins walk to the British Museum (the hotel is on Museum road). About 10 mins to Covent Garden.

There are numerous cafes, restaurants etc. within easy walking distance.

Had a double room which cost \u00c2\u00a395 per night through the hotel website. Prices are cheaper, on certian dates, if you book well in advance. Although payment is taken immediately, when booking online, this can be cancelled up to 12 noon on the day of arrival at no penalty. Main resaon for staying was location and the availability of a smoking room, these have their own floor. Please note, all UK Travelodges will cease to offer smoking rooms from January 2008. Check in is from 3pm and check out is 12 noon, didn't bother with breakfast but this can be pre-ordered, at a discount, on the hotel website. If you decide to have breakfast after arriving at the hotel it is more expensive. Nearest underground is Covent Garden which is exit only until December 2008. Leicester Square underground is about a 5 minute walk. Check in was problem free and fairly quick although I did see queues later on in the day. You use your room key card to access the door to the lifts. The room was a decent size but the decor was very tired and in need of refurbishment. Some light bulbs did not work and there was only one towel, even though I specified, on the online booking form, that two people would be in the room. The double bed had two pillows and there was only one spare. No toiletries are provided but this is made clear on the website. The extractor fan in the bathroom did not work and the water was VERY hot. A bath with shower attachment is provided. There are ample electrical sockets in the room and the small flat screen TV takes a little working out. Switch it on using the small buttons along the top first. There is no channel guide but the channels are displayed on the TV. The room only had one chair and there are no drawers, although there are some shelves and hanging spaces with about six hangers. The double glazing is poor allowing noise and wind through. I did not notice any aircon and there are heaters in the room. On our way out for the evening, I asked at reception if we could have another towel and pillow. The receptionist brought these and assumed we would take them up to our room. I did not expect this from a hotel charging \u00c2\u00a395 per night. We collected these when we came back later. The hotel has a bar/cafe and their website says \"eat drink and be merry until well past your bedtime.\" The bar is not open during the day and closes at 11pm (certainly not past my bedtime!) Of course there are many places open late for meals/ drinks but I wish the hotel would advertise the bar opening times clearly on their website, instead of using a spurious statement. There are vending machines selling snacks etc, but one of these was broken and remained so during our stay. We went out the next day and on returning to the hotel room, in the afternoon, found that the key card would not open the door. I took it to reception and found that they had only validated it for one day. Again, not what I would expect for a hotel charging what they did. If I stayed there again I would book in advance and get a better rate. However, if Travelodge withdraw their smoking rooms next January, I will be looking for somewhere else who do offer smoking rooms.

The receptionist seemed puzzled by this - my first incidence of finding that the staff at the Hotel were somewhat overawed at finding themselves running such a large operation! I was dreading the room in the Drury lane part but we got lucky - a room to the rear on level 7. great view and not noisy at all. Having stayed at T'lodges before I would say this was smaller than average and the decor was ultra basic. However it was clean. The room was a family room and I was expecting a sofabed - but there was a separate single which may have been a camp bed in aprevious existance. My advice is that unless you are prepared to put up with absolutely no frills and average service go for a better class of establishment. In the end the only real let down was the breakfast - the room was overrun and several dishes on the hotplate were unavailable as the few staff failed to cope.

This seemed very poor for \u00c2\u00a395 as I knew other people had paid only \u00c2\u00a326. We asked to move and were moved to a much bigger room in the Holbourn building round the corner with a large sofa, bigger bed and a bath. The room was much better but the bathroom smelt of wee and the shower curtain smelt mouldy. The main problem was the noise at night. We were on the fourth floor and there was a lot of noise all night from the room. I realise this may be a hazard of being on a main road, but it sounded like the windows were open when they weren't which I guess means they were not sealed properly. I think properly sealed double glazing would have cut out most of the noise. I imagine the Drury Lane building is probably much quieter as it is a much quieter road. The other problem we had is that when we plugged the kettle in to the socket it made a crackling noise and an awful burning smell. We thought the kettle was the problem, but when we got a new kettle (not til the next day as there were no spares), it wouldn't work in that socket either. The breakfast was fine, although the cooked food a bit lukewarm. I thought it was really bad that you couldn't pay less (\u00c2\u00a34.50 maybe) for just the cold buffet. I think they probably lose a lot of custom for breakfast from people who don't want to pay \u00c2\u00a37.50 for some cereal and toast etc. I realise they probably don't want to offer a cheaper option as then hopefully people will pay \u00c2\u00a37.50 as they have no other option, but I think many people will not be prepared to pay \u00c2\u00a37.50 if all they want is a cold breakfast. Saying all this, the location of the hotel is great - near Holborn, Covent Garden and Tottenham Court road tube stops and was about the cheapest hotel I could find 2 weeks in advance of our stay.

We arrived about 11:00 am and were lucky that a room was available and we were allowed into it. The room was tired looking. It had only one towel for 2 people fortunately there was a trolley outside of our room so we took another. There was no hairdryer or toiletries and funnily there was an explanation that their research showed that guests do not want these as they bring their own! - I don't, not now - I might have said this in the 1970s but not in 2007. i had paid \u00c2\u00a395 for this room and wanted something for that money. We were out for the rest of the day and when we returned to the hotel at about 5;00 there were some youngsters playing around the reception area outside. we were on teh ground floor so they were right outside our room. Let's just say they were not residents. At 6:30ish I walked across the courtyard to reception to ask for a hairdryer. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my turn as there was only one person checking people in. I asked if I could borrow a hairdryer - this is what the hotel information tells you to do. The receptionist appeared astonished and said they didn't have one. People were only allowed to have them for 2 hours and they were all out. Ok I said I would get one in the morning. I then asked about the people who were dossing on the forecourt being very loud. Again she looked astonished as if she had not heard them - she then rang for security and they were removed. Now as I said we paid \u00c2\u00a395 for this room and when asked if we wanted breakfast we were charged a further \u00c2\u00a37.50 each. So already the total was \u00c2\u00a3110. Sorry travellodge but there are cheaper better value for money hotels in and around london then this - MUCH better. We've stayed in them often. Anyway it doesn't stop there. All night the emergency alarm kept going off through out the night so you didn't even get a good night sleep. The following morning at the entrance to breakfast they had put a sign up apologising for this. it explained about the health and safety of residents, but did not explain why it had kept going off. We are all aware of the importance of health and safety but that does not explain why the alarm kept going off waking their residents. Now, back to the hairdryer. the following morning i asked for a hairdryer and was again told they were all out. They had all been out since the previous evening. Now in my mind that means they were out longer than the 2 hours i was told. Breakfast was Ok but for \u00c2\u00a37.50 you could get better variety in one of the bars in the area. We asked if we could leave our luggage until our journey home but were told they had no luggage area, but we could keep our room for \u00c2\u00a310 until 2:00pm or \u00c2\u00a326 to keep the room until 5:00pm and we could keep the luggage in the room. SEo the cost was mounting up. Most good quality hotels - and not so good offer a luggage hold facility. We went up to Euston instead and put the luggage into left luggage - at least it was in teh area for our journey home Would I stay again - No Have i stayed in travelodges before - yes but not in London Should travelodge review what their customers want - yes.

The rate I got was the \"rack rate\" of \u00c2\u00a395 a night. I've heard some good and bad things about this hotel, but decided to give it a try. Luckily I checked in at around 2pm, when I came down from my room at 4pm the single receptionist had a queue of over 15 people checking in. Each check in was quick at around 3 mins, but if you're stuck at the back of the line a 40min wait isn't a good start to your break. The 2 self-service check in kiosks in reception were both broken for the 4 days I was here, this would really grate on me if I was stood in a line for 40 minutes waiting for my room key that I had already paid for months in advance. Security is obviously an issue here as key-card access is required to the hotel lobby after 6pm and at all times to get to the lifts. The decor of the public areas is shabby and tired, not a place I would like to relax in. Doors and woodwork in corridors are bashed, chipped and broken. The room was visibly clean but felt dirty and well used, the double bed was 4ft 6 wide and the springs could be felt through the mattress. Cupboard had 6 hangers for 2 people and inside light didn't work. Bedside light was broken and had scorched the wooded headboard. The TV looked good but picture was unwatchable on a fair few channels due to a bad antennae signal. Wireless internet access was very flaky, signal strength was never above low. Curtains were tired and hard to pull closed but did keep the light out. Shower was powerful and did a great job, towels seemed well used and hard. There's no toiletries or phones in the rooms (in order to keep cost down). My partner had to make her way down to reception with wet hair to borrow a hairdryer from reception. Tip - do this on your way up to your room to avoid this happening to you! I could have booked a \"proper\" hotel for about \u00c2\u00a320-\u00c2\u00a330 a night more. Put simply I thought that saving \u00c2\u00a390 over my 3 nights would be worth it. I felt it was not. Part of your experience in London is the hotel you choose and this didn't make our trip bad, but just made it feel cheap and tacky. You can feel your spirit sapping when you walk up the litter and food strewn steps which are off the rough end of Drury Lane towards reception. Here's the crux - IF you can book this hotel for less than \u00c2\u00a350 a night then I would stay here for a night or two.

Good security as you use your keycard to access the door to the rooms. Lifts were quick and my room on floor 13 was very spacious and clean, comfy bed, fan, clean bath/shower room with power shower.

We thought we were staying at the Travelodge Covent Garden on Drury Lane, but at check in we were directed up the road to their other base on High Holborn Street. This is still part of the Traveloge Covent Garden though - they just have two bases. This hotel is newer than the one on Drury Lane. We had no problems checking in and staff were polite. The room was fine and the usual no frills you get with Travelodge and everything was clean and tidy. There was a funny smell in the corridors (we were on floor 2) - like a mix between a cigarette smell and an unwashed person - it wasn't strong, but not exactly pleasant, but the smell didn't appear to be in the rooms thankfully. The only complaint I have was we were in a room that faced the main road and I couldn't get to sleep from all the traffic noise (cars, emergency vehicles, people on the streets). I would stay again at this hotel, but ask for a room that isn't facing the main road. We didn't eat breakfast here, but it's \u00c2\u00a37.50 per person (adult) for an all you can eat breakfast. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room, along with a spare pillow, towels, and a bar of soap. We even had a little desk fan in there too. There was a tele, and I believe you can have internet connection as well. For heating, there is a radiator heater if you get cold. Last year we stayed at the Travelodge Covent Garden on Drury Lane for when we went to see The Producers at the Drury Lane Theatre (now where Lord of the Rings is, and it was just a 2 min walk away) and this isn't as modern as the High Holborn one, but still the same standard you get with a Travelodge. We were in a room that wasn't facing the main road but the forecourt area of the travelodge and there was no noise. The room we had was slightly bigger than the room we stayed in on High Holborn Street and still v.clean and tidy etc. We had breakfast at this one and my husband took advantage of the all you can eat breakfast and ate, cereals, yoghurt, fruit, eggs, beans, sausages etc! He sees the 'all you can eat' as a challenge! The food was fine, and average, nothing great but definitely edible. Again in the room there were tea/coffee making facilities, towels, spare pillow and a bar of soap. At the time of staying there was no desk top fan or proper radiator, but what was like a convector heater?! I was a bit cold in the room as it was early springtime and found the heater didn't warm the room very well - but this was over a year ago now and not sure if any of the facilities have been upgraded. Again staff were polite. Although there was one thing, this stay was part of our anniversary and my husband had requested flowers to be sent to the hotel, he then asked the staff if they would put the flowers in our room as part of the surprise, however they wouldn't do it as rooms are allocated on arrival but agreed that they would hand them to me at the desk upon checking in. We have recommended this hotel to many of our friends and family who've come from all over for trips to London, and everyone has been happy with it. Some have stayed at the Travelodge's near to Kings Cross and have found the Covent Garden Travelodge's to be much better in overall area, standards and location (a good base to explore from, near to some theatres, eateries etc).", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and location...\u201d", "Author": "Celgirl", "ReviewID": "UR8236561", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in July 2007 and I have to say that I was very happy.

The entrance area in previous reviews has been described as drab, grey and miserable.But I have to point out that this Central London hotel shares it's steps with office buildings for BT (a reputable company) and various advertising agencies. There are about 10 grey-stone steps from the street up to the main entrance but this is in no way depressing or drab - it's just the entrance!

There was no dirt to be found in the spotless white bathroom or new-slate flooring. The bedroom consisted of two beds, a wardrobe with shelves, a desk with a television and remote, tea and coffee making facilities, a desk with a reading lamp and a large window with a blackout curtain.

The only bad points were that there was no hairdryer in the room (these can be borrowed from reception though for a 2-hour period if you leave a valid credit card as security), and the duvet was a little on the thin side.

A further 5 mins walk takes you into the heart of Covent Garden which was ideal, and then later, a 5 minute walk in the other direction from the hotel took us straight to the Aldwych Theatre for our show. All in all, a great location for a short stay in the capital if you want shows and shopping! Oxford St is only a short tube ride away and if you are short on time, this location is surely hard to beat for the price.

Was not expecting much seeing as it is a Travelodge after all said and done - but was very surprised with the excellent clean room, newly refurbished bathroom and very helpful and freindly staff on reception and in the Cafe Bar. Dont know whether you all know this, but the Travelodge is situated on 2 sites - one is in Drury LAne and the other is across the road on the corner of Museum Road and High Holborn - they are both classed as Travelodge Covent Garden - so you can check in at either reception. We checked in at and stayed at the newer one on the corner of Museum Street & High Holborn - this only opened in 2006 hence the very good standard of bedrooms/bathrooms. This would be my recommendation. Both sites have the Cafe Bar which serves breakfast and a limited food menu - on the Sunday morning we chose to have (all you can eat) breakfast for \u00c2\u00a37.50 (bargain) - there were no free tables available at the time (quite normal for any hotel in england at 10.00am on a Sunday morning!) - but with no problem at all they suggested we wnet over the road to the other site who currently had no queue - the member of staff even took us across the road right up to the entrance - very impressed. One little trick you might like to try on the Travelodge website - I had originally booked a 3 night stay and the cost was only \u00c2\u00a389 per night. HOWEVER - if you try booking 1 night at a time and adding the nights into your shopping basket you will get offered any cheaper rates that might only be available for the 1 night. We did this and got the Friday night for only \u00c2\u00a349 instead of the \u00c2\u00a389. Only drawback is that you have to go to the manned reception each morning and check out and check in - NO YOU DONT HAVE TO MOVE ROOMS OR PACK UP EITHER11! All in all this hotel is in a fantastic location - a few mins walk from 2 Tube statsions Holborn on the Central Line or a few mins from Tottenham Court Road on the PIccadily Line. We enjoyed our stay and location so much that we will most definately stay again and not spend hours trawling the internet for cheap hotel rooms in London.

We were not advised by the less than charming reception staff that the lift was not working and we carried our cases up a flight of stairs to a cold room which had only one towell and one extra pillow. It is not possible to phone reception from the room so I had to retrace my steps to reception where I received a grudging apology and towell and pillowcase were subsequently delivered. I found it quite annoying that there there is a note in the room explaining why the facilities in the hotel are so sparse. Apparently it is for our benefit to keep the cost as low as possible but I suspect it is more for the convenience of management and staff. One annoying deficiency is the lack of a luggage room which means that if you arrive early or want to stay in the area after checking out time, you need to carry your luggage with you or find storage elsewhere. Another problem is the breakfast which is cooked then stewed in heated containers - and what excuse can there be for serving canned mushrooms when fresh are so readily available?

When I arrived there had been a mix-up with my booking which would have meant having to change rooms after 2 nights. The receptionist kindly changed my room to 707. When I reached my room it became clear that it was the 'penthouse suite', on the top floor with a stunning view across central London. I had a panoramic view that swept from St Pauls, across Westminster and across the West End. Simply stunning, and worth hundreds of pounds per night. The room itself was large, with standard Travelodge decor. I had no problems with the room at all. One thing that annoyed me was the habit of the staff coming to clean your room at 8.30 am. This happened to me on two occassions. This was just a little too early in my opinion to come to clean the rooms. I did not eat in the hotel, therefore I am unable to rate the food on offer. As for the surrounding area there is no doubt that the hotel is in the more downmarket part of Covent Garden. The location is excellent for shopping, the theatre and other attractions. I concur with other reviewers about the 'dodgy' people that hang about around the hotel. I returned one night at about midnight and there were quite a crowd of young people gathered at the steps infront of the hotel. During the day the area infront of the hotel is occupied by smokers from a nearby office block. As regards coming back to the hotel at night I would recommend getting a tube to Holborn and then walking along High Holborn to the hotel. High Holborn is well lit and there are numerous bars about and it is safe. One night I took the tube to Tottenham Court Road and went the short cut along St Giles High St. I was stopped by a rather nasty beggar whom I gave a pound to but this was still not enough for him. In the end I simply walked away from him but I didn't feel very safe coming this way back to the hotel. Also, coming through Long Acre and Drury Lane itself I noticed many beggars about. In summary, I was pleased with the room itself and the facilities in the hotel. But the surrounding area left a lot to be desired and I will have to think a lot before I decide to stay here again.

However, despite its newness it lacked air conditioning, something you would have thought would be a standard facility, we also had one wheel missing off the roll out camp bed, making it a lop-sided sleep for our 7 year old son. I would stay here again at the cheap rate, but would be reluctant to pay the going rate of \u00c2\u00a389 a night as I am sure you could find better for the same money. Breakfast is also extra at \u00c2\u00a36.50 per adult, although kids do eat for free. Location is very good, only a ten minute walk from Holborn Tube Station.

And I can safely say it was lovely. We only paid \u00c2\u00a326.00 per night and compared to the prices we usually pay we were a little apprehensive. Especially after reading some of the reviews. But I can honestly say we will definately be booking to return. We arrived early well before our check in time and we were given our room straight away. The room was smaller than what we usually have but when your in London all you want is a nice firm bed(which we got),clean towels(that were huge) and a good shower(definate awakener). And that is exactly what we got. On previous visits we have stayed at the Thistle Hotels and I can assure you we wont be bothering again. We would rather pay less and have more money to spend on enjoying ourselves. We didnt book for breakfast as we thought the \u00c2\u00a36.50 was a little steep. We went to the Wetherspoons pub round the corner and got a fantastic full english for \u00c2\u00a31.99 and they opened at 8am. With regards to \"people\" hanging around the front steps we never had a problem. On one evening I returnexd to the hotel whilst my partner went to the cash point and it was well past midnight and I didnt feel at all frightened or intimidated. The staff on reception were attentive and helpful. Nothing was to much trouble On the whole the Travel Lodge Covent Garden was a real pleasure to stay at.

I finally made it to the hotel with out having my teeth knocked out or hit over the head with a blunt oject. Check in was painless and the rooms are what you expect for something of this budget, which to be is fair excellent value given the location. A word of warning try to avoid room 1 , my fellow hotel guests appeared to confuse my internal telephone number with that of reception . As a result I had to endure numerous calls through the night ranging from \"is that reception\" to \" have we a cleaner I have soiled myself\". When you are tired and just want to sleep believe me you patience does wear thin, the last call I had a 5.00 am almost resulted in me ripping the phone off the wall, locating the caller an inserting the phone in him. Another downside of rooms on the west side of the building is that directly opposite them is a residential block of flats where the residents sit out on the balconies drinking and being loud.

All I could say to any reader is IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS NEGATIVE FEEDBACK! I'm a frequent stayer in London, circa 6 times per year and I am always on the lookout for good budget price accomodation. I've got to say, this hotel was an excellent budget choice - the location was amazing, only 5-10 mins walk to Leicester Square, the hotel is literally on Shaftesbury Avenue so an easy walk down towards the centre. The room although basic was functional - very spacious, clean, well decorated, quality towels and linen etc. General condition of the hotel - better than some advertised 4*, the ongoing refurbishment has made a big difference and there is little sign of work or disturbance by contractors. The staff were friendly and accomodating. Do not have any worries about safety, this hotel is on a fairly busy road so plenty of passers by etc and the soundproofing of the room was excellent - minimal traffic noise etc! Only downside was the security locking of the bedroom window which prevented them from being opened - but this was compensated by the TWO fans which were in the room and only having 1 bar of soap in the bathroom, but again Reception will give you as many as you need!!! I will definitely stay here again even if I have to pay the full room rate; the location, savings on tube tickets and staff etc make it one of my top choices for future stays.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cOkay if you're on a strict budget, otherwise look elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "LeeB.", "ReviewID": "UR5380046", "Content": "As other posters have mentioned, this is a no-frills hotel. When I checked in, the clerk told me my room rate, which was a lot more than I had booked on the internet. Fortunately, I had an email printout of my reservation for two nights. The first room I was given was quite small, and I knew there were larger rooms as I had stayed here when it was the Drury Lane Moat House. I went back to reception and was given the room next door, which was much larger and had more furniture. There was one large towel and a bath mat, two plastic cups and one small bar of soap in the bathroom. There was no top sheet between the duvet cover and the fitted sheet and the duvet cover didn't look particularly clean so I didn't use it. Thankfully London was experiencing a heat wave so I wasn't cold at night. As others have also stated, there are lots of fire doors and huge used towel containers in the hallways at all times. You can't dial reception from your room, which I found very odd, but the hotel says it's a cost-saving measure. There is a large outdoor entryway to the hotel and one time saw a young man sleeping on the ground for several hours and other time a couple of intimidating guys lingering on the steps. Though I saw all of this in the daytime, I would have been rather nervous approaching the hotel in the later evening. I won't be staying here again, no matter how inexpensive the rate is.

I worked there 27 years ago when it was managed by Grand Metropolitan Hotels and known as the Drury Lane Hotel. After having made the beds and cleaned the bathrooms of guests who stayed at this 4-star hotel, I thought it would be a hoot to return as one myself. With such a great location, I do not understand why this lodging degenerated into what it is now. The corridors to the rooms have quite a few doors installed, presumably to stop the spread of any future fires, making it very difficult to find the rooms and tote luggage. No porters were available to assist guests. The nice restaurant and bar has disappeared. There is no longer any room service. The telephones disappeared from the sleeping rooms. Although it technically is not a motel since the doors of the guest rooms open into a corridor, the service is equivilent. I stayed for three nights last July, and for two of those my sleep was interrupted by a fire alarm. I was given room 141, which immediately struck me as odd since the Drury Lane had no sleeping rooms under the fifth floor. That was where we found the laundry, staff dining room, and other behind-the-scenes facilities. There was also no direct route to it from inside the front lobby. I had to walk outside to reach it. I was constantly losing my way around. The room itself was in scruffy condition; however, it did provide a fully functional old style hairdryer (with an air hose) and an electric tea kettle with accoutrements. The TV only received about 4 or 5 VHF channels. All in all, I was really disappointed to what had become of the 4-star hotel where I had spent my summer of 1979. I even paid the full asking price of \u00c2\u00a385 p/n for the experience. If I had gotten a bargain rate, I doubt I would have been as disappointed. After all, aren't Travelodges about economy?
