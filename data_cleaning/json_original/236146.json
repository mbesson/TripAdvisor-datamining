Yes, pricey but given its location, understandably so. We will stay again on our next visit.

As we were in Rome for the archaeology the location was very good as we were in walking distance of most of the important monuments. On occasions we did use the buses which are numerous a few minutes walk away and cheap at 1 Euro for 75 minutes. (buy your ticket in advance) Taxis are not cheap nor easy to come by in the area of the hotel so be prepared to walk. We were accomodated in 3 adjacent rooms, two were good sized, the third adequate. All were spotlessly clean, with very comfortable beds and sparkling white bed linen. There was a lack of drawers and hanging space was limited in the smaller room. Our rooms faced an inner court and were very quiet, except for the local seagulls who seem to be active 24/7! I find the criticism of breakfast strange: there was, indeed, tinned fruit, but also a variety of fresh fruit as well as cereals, yoghurt and fruit juices. Scrambled and boiled eggs were hot and there was a variety of cold meats and cheese, rolls, bread and croisants. Coffee came from a machine but there was a good selection of decent tea bags. The breakfast room was always busy and a bit claustrophobic but the staff were attentive and kept everything replenished. There is a small bar and sitting area downstairs. The staff were pleasant and plentiful.

The staff was exceptional (except of course for 2 staff members....). The conceirge helped us months ahead of time (one conceirge was exceptional while the other, a family member of the hotel, couldn't be bothered). The conceirge assured us she could help us get gluten free meals for our daughters with celiac disease. When we arrived she spent a lot of time on the computer helping me find gluten free options throughout Rome. She seemed to really enjoy her job and it was a pleasure seeing her smiling face every morning. We had incredible service from the kitchen staff. At the start of our first breakfast the waiter showed me a drawer with gluten free breakfast options for us (breads, crackers, etc). All were delicious and we wished we could get those brands in the US. The waiters (all men) greeted warmly each morning and brought our daughters hot chocolate shortly after they were seated. These kind, gentlemen started our days off right. Finally the front desk staff was thoughtful and kind. The warmly greeted us each time we picked up our key or dropped it off at night. They often helped us make dinner reservations or give us tips before heading out the front door. Of course, one of the front desk men was the age of our daughters and they were thrilled to see him each day (lots of blushing and shy looks...oh well, that's Roma!). The room was spacious, clean and more than we expected. A few nights did warm up more than we were used to but really not a problem. The location is great for setting out on foot. Also, there is some fun street nightlife a 5 minute walk around the corner to the front of the Pantheon (outdoor cafes, street performers, music). Overall, the staff at this hotel made our trip a wonderful time we will all remember for years! The other reviews said the staff was rude and I have to agree that we did run into 2 individuals who were downright rude & both are family members of the Albergo.

It is next to the Pantheon and the church of S.Maria sopra Minerva and therefore near everything. We needed 2 rooms , one with 2 single beds, which this hotel was able to provide. It is of course a very old building but the rooms are comfortable and quiet ( still have carpets in rooms) and bathrooms were updated (but the shower head is strangely positionned in the midle of the long wall above the bath so I innondated the bathroom floor a few times...). Breakfast is included. They have a nice selection of cereals, yogurt, croissant, fruits. Also eggs, boncoccini and prosciuto. Like many hotels in Italy, they will make you coffee at your request.

We left for the airport by limousine that the hotel called for us (48E, large enough for 4 people and 4 medium size suitcases).

The bath was about as big as the room and had plenty of space for all my toiletries. One thing to note, especially if traveling with elders or children. The tub required a step up and there were no grab bars, making for an unsteady landing. Also lacking was free Wifi - they have Wifi, but it costs 10 euros/day! I leave for last one of the best things about this hotel - the location. It is around the corner from the Pantheon, down the block from the Temple Minerva, right near Giolitti's Gelataria.

This hotel is very centrally located at a quiet street, just a few streets behind the Pantheon. Everything was very easily accessible. Piazza Navona is like 5 min walk away. Rooms The rooms were very spacious by Europe standards, in fact one of the most spacious I've seen. As the hotel is located along a quiet street, sleep was peaceful and wonderful. All rooms were accessible via elevator. My room came with a personal electronic safe too. Plug points on the desk were very conveniently located. I've been to some hotels where the plug points are in some ridiculous locations making connecting power a pain but not for this hotel. Breakfast Breakfast was buffet-style and the portion and variety was generous. Internet My only small gripe was with the internet wifi. First of all, you have to pay for it - Euro 10 per day. And there is no connection on the fourth floor. Every time I need access to the internet, I have to bring my laptop to the lobby area. All in all, a very pleasant experience.

We were there at the end of March and the weather had turned a bit warm. The hotel still had on the heat and the air conditioning would not work. We were in the annex section and as you wandered your way to that building you could feel the heat increase. I complained several times and was told to open my windows. When I did that the noise was incredible and went on all night long. The Pantheon area must be the gathering place for all of the drunks or something. They hooted and yelled constantly. The horse hoofs from the carriages and the sea gulls drove us nuts. We had to close the windows and we burned up all night. I didn't get a good nights sleep the entire stay. The beds, linens, and towels were really quite nice and of a good quality. Be sure to bring your own hairdryer because the one in the bathroom was a joke. The shower was so tiny that I do not know how a large person could even fit. The toiletries were basic and not of a good quality. You might want to bring your own bath soap and shampoo because I think there was only some kind of bath gel in a tiny bottle. If you plan to use your computer you better stay elsewhere. They only offer WiFi in the lounge area but it never worked. It costs 5euros per hour block of time. I was able to get on one day in a five day stay.

We had been staying at the Hotel Lancelot, about which everyone raves on Tripadvisor. We were disappointed by the tiny and charmless room and the lousy location of the Lancelot. Our first day in Rome we passed by the Santa Chiara on our way to the Piazza Navona for lunch and I was sufficiently charmed by the exterior to step in and inquire about availability. Sure enough, they had a room. We moved there two days later, and were entirely satisfied with our stay. There are not many hotels in the Centro Storico district of Rome, and none has the combination of moderate price and quality that the Santa Chiara has. The hotel sits on a little side square tucked in behind the Pantheon. The interesting thing is that in the one block from the Pantheon to the hotel, the incredible summertime crowds that mob the Pantheon at all hours just dissipate. As a result, the hotel is much quieter and calmer than its location would suggest. The result is a perfect combination of quiet and central location. Piazza Navona is two minutes away, as are the Jesu, the Trevi Fountain, the Palazzo Colonna, and most of the loveliest churches in Rome. The Vatican, the Villa Borghese, the Spanish Steps, and the Forum are all within reasonable walking distance for someone in decent shape. We had read from the reviews here that some folks complained of traffic noise. There is an easy solution to that. Just ask for a room on the interior courtyard. These rooms are incredibly quiet and they are also a bit larger than the exterior rooms, some of which have balconies that cut into the room size. Our room also had the biggest bathroom we have ever seen in a European hotel. I will say that the room furniture was a bit outdated--we were not in the recently updated wing. Still, we were very happy with the room, and indeed we were so close to everything that we spent very little time there. The lobby is very elegant, and the breakfast room is fine, though it could use redecorating--all of the bright chrome gives it an institutional feel. The breakfast was very good, with lots of selection, but not quite as spectacular as at our B&Bs in Venice and Florence. Finally, a word as to the staff. Many folks on Tripadvisor have commented on the unfriendly staff. Most of these comments reveal a longing for American style customer service that favors familiar and informal behavior. My experience of the hotel staff at the Santa Chiara was one of an older European reserve. It isn't uncaring and it isn't unfriendly, it is just old school European.

We used this hotel as it had a quadruple room available for our dates; the dates being fairly inflexible for us. Our overall impression is of a smart, clean, well organised hotel. Our room was cleaned every day to a high standard. It was an expensive option for us but we knew the price before we booked and we made our choice - everyones budget is different.

Buffet breakfast in the clean,smart breakfast room was excellent - a wide choice of food. Breakfast cereals, rolls, cheese, cold meat, lemon and chocolate cake(!), fruits, yoghurts, hot and cold drinks. Breakfast available until 10:30. A word of caution for wheelchair users. Our quad room was right at the top of the hotel which did involve a tiny lift and two smallish sets of stairs. This was not a real problem for us as we are used to carrying our daughter and wheelchair separately - if you were an adult totally dependent on the chair our quad room would have been out of the question.

After months of research I booked a triple room on the hotel website for my grown daughter, son, and myself. Never having been to Italy, or even Europe, I was surprised to see that the room and interior of the building is as modern as it is. While by no means luxurious, perhaps comperable to a Holiday Inn in the U.S., the room was of a fair size for the three of us. It had excellent closet space and a good size bathroom. Everything was immacuately clean. The breakfast had a varied selection of offerings and the quality was good. There was occasional construction noise coming from the building outside our window but it didn't start before 7:30 or 8:00 and didn't continue on all day every day. We spend little time in our room so it never became a problem. The hotel is on a nice little clobblestone sidestreet that is fairly quiet and yet busy enough to not feel isolated. Just around the corner is the crowded Pantheon and many small shops and cafes as well as an excellent gelateria! You can walk pretty much anywhere. We took a quick cab to the Vatican but easily walked trom the hotel to the Borghese Gallery as well as the Coliseum and Trastavere areas of the city --and this from an overweight, middle-aged woman wearing a plastic boot on her leg because of an ankle injury! With every step and turn of the head there is something fabulous to to see. I read many reviews about the hotel staff being \"unfriendly\" but had decided it wouldn't really matter if everything else was good. By the time we left however, we came to the realization that for us it did matter. We felt it was very uncomfortable and off-putting to come in and out of the building, walking within 5 feet of the front desk, and no one ever smiled, greeted us, or even looked up. It put just a little damper on the stay. Overall, although the location is outstanding, I probably would not stay again at Albergo Santa Chiara.

This was our second visit to Rome and a repeat stay at the Albergo Santa Chiara. The management had graciously acknowledged our repeat visit and honored our request for room 407 with a terrace. In fact, I believe that rooms 405 and 406 also have terraces overlooking the narrow street below, which could be utilized for having a morning capuccino or an afternoon glass of wine and listening to Rome go by. Unfortunately, we were too busy exploring Rome to take the time and sit on the terrace. Perhaps next time. Otherwise, our room and bathroom were of a comfortable size and sufficient amenities. No frills, no antiques, nothing fancy, just clean, comfortable, air conditioned accommodations. A terrific breakfast is included in the nightly rate, which consists of various cheeses and cold cuts, cereals and yogurt, hard boiled eggs, fresh and canned fruit, breads and sweet rolls, and made to order cappucinno. My all time favorite? A hard roll with mortadella and a cappucinno. Who is going to bother making such a great breakfast at home, so why not indulge? The hotel caters to quite a bit of business people since there are several governmental institutions in the immediate vicinity, and I kind of have a feeling that this is the reason why the front desk staff are rather reserved. These folks do not do big smiles but they are not snobs either and, whatever one might need, will be accomplished in the most professional manner. Case on point, we were not able to reserve a visit to the Borghese Gallery prior to our departure for Italy, since the October reservations were not yet opened. I e-mailed Federica at the Santa Chiara and she assured me that she would keep on trying until she secured reservations for us. And she did. As usual and customary, I would like to recommend Settimio, a terrific restaurant, which is located a short walking distance from the Santa Chiara at Via delle Colonnelle, 14; local phone number: [--]. I would recommend making reservations; however, keep in mind that Settimio is closed on Sundays and Mondays. Settimio is patronized by the residents, tourists, and business people, and serves great food at reasonable prices. Antipasto Settimio is a plate full of Italian delicacies; first course of pasta with fresh porcini mushrooms (during fall months) is not to be missed, and roast lamb will melt in one's mouth. I recommend a sgroppino for dessert. In addition to great food, head waiter Georgio is a sweetheart. How about a great espresso or monakera (coffee, chocolate, and whipped cream)? Then one must stop at Cafe St. Eustachio located in the Piazza of the same name, again, right around the Pantheon and the Santa Chiara.

The hotel was recommended to us by my cousin, who has stayed there many times over the past 17 years. She was with us, and noticed a great change in the hospitality of the staff. We stayed at 6 different hotels during our visit to Italy, and Santa Chiara certainly had the most aloof staff. They barely picked their heads up when we approached the desk in the lobby. This was a sharp contrast to the warm welcomes we received at the other hotels, where after a day or two the staff knew us by name and room number. We thought the rooms were bare bones. Adequate, and clean, but no extras. One night we had to call the front desk for toilet paper! I was also disappointed in the selection of English speaking television channels. The other hotels we stayed in spoiled us with availability of American television, and we were able to relax and unwind with some TV after a long day of touring. We thought that breakfast was OK, but not great. The cappuccino was kept a secret, and the American coffee at the buffet was awful. We didn't crack the secret code for cappuccino until the day before we left... once we did - it was delicious. (You had to seek out a waiter, and specifically request cappuccino).

The breakfast is superb, I defy anybody not to find something they like, ask for the cappuccino its great. I stayed last time in the Caesar residence Romane, rated 4th in Rome. This is better. It is a good comfortbale 3 star hotel with a great breakfast in the romatic centre of the Centro Storic. If you want to stay indoors all day, other hotels will surpass. If you want a clean comfortable base with a great breakfast in the ivy clad heart of the centro storico in the absolutley BEST location in Rome. I promise you you will not beat this hotel.
