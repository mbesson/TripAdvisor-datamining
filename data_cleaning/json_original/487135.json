{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very nice place I was traveling around China for 4 weeks last year, pretty much all of the month of june. The foreign experts hotel really stands out in my mind as one of the nicest hotels I stayed at during my trip. I tried a variety of 3 and 4 star hotels. I discovered that a standard room in a 4 star is a lot nicer than a suite at a 3 star hotel. Foreign experts hotel is definitely a 4 star venue. Location is alright, worked really well for me since i was close to my friend and close to the summer palace, maybe 20 or 30 rmb taxi ride to the forbidden city. In the surrounding area there is the best duck restraunt! maybe about a block away behind and to the left. Sorry name escapes me... After searching online prices for my up and coming trip, definitely recommend booking in person. Its like 4 times more expensive booking online right now.", "Date": "May 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR995782800", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "thedamtour"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d487135-r16060889-Beijing_Foreign_Experts_Building-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "487135", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
