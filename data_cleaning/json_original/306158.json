The TV worked OK until an electrical appliance was used then the reception was all distorted.The best was the suspended hot water system from the bathroom ceiling - possibly placed there when the Hotel was built.Care factor from staff was zero - & our room was behind the reception desk so we were walking past them every day & they would only acknowledge us in response to our greeting.

Granted, all my previous visits have been as a Solo Traveller, stopping off on my way home to the UK after visiting friends in Australia, and my requirements where not as critical as this time. This year I was visiting for just over two weeks with my Fiancee, and wanted us to have as much comfort as I could afford. It took a lot of surfing through agency websites before I found a hotel in Singapore that had a room that didn't stretch my budget too much, and that looked any bigger than a MATCHBOX !!! In fact I got my dates totally mixed up (I added one more day than I should have done to my overnight flight from Manchester, via Doha, and when I tried to check in at Beach Hotel, they looked confused and said they had NO RESERVATION IN MY NAME !!! Only when we compared paperwork did they spot that my Booking Confirmation said 14 nights from Feb 9th ...... and today was Feb 8th !!! They got their doorman to take me to Park View Hotel (just three doors away) and they could provide a room for that night .................. and although a little MORE expensive .......... my Fiancee's first comment as she walked into the room was ..... \"Oh, what a TINY ROOM !\" Thankfully when we arrived at the FAR LESS IMPRESSIVE LOOKING Beach Hotel the following day, the room we were given, although not as nicely furnished, was nearly TWICE the size of the room at Park View. My Fiancee flew home to The Philippines a couple of days before I left for the UK, and for the last two nights, in order to try to save some money, I moved myself into a Much Cheaper Hotel, where I \"enjoyed\" THE TINIEST HOTEL ROOM I'VE EVER SEEN !!! Based upon my hunt for the Best Room I could afford, and my later experience, I have to say that for $130 SG a night, I wouldn't be surprised if Beach Hotel offered the BIGGEST & BEST ROOM in City Centre Singapore ! Our room had a Huge Bed (Very comfy too), plenty of space for our luggage and for walking about, a small table, with two chairs, a small wardrobe with a fridge under, and a drawer and storage shelves under the \"Dressing Table\". We had lots of windows, many which opened and of course Aircon, and a small but adequate Bathroom. There was an electric water heater, so there was ALWAYS hot water available. All the Staff were Very friendly and Helpful, and Especially so the lady who cleaned rooms on our floor. As Bryan H said in his review .... DON'T be put off by the TOTALLY UNIMPRESSIVE Access and Reception Area ! I wonder \"what on Earth have I booked us into\" when I first arrived !!! This place definitely fits into the expression ... \"Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover\". Beach Hotel is a very short walk to Bugis Village, Bugis Street Market and Bugis MRT Station and it is surrounded by Shops, Street Cafes and Restaurants. It's a good area and well placed for getting around. I was taken ill just two days after arriving. I damaged my spine in a lifting accident at work 20 years ago, and an awkward pull from my G/F to get me out of bed for Breakfast triggered agonising pain. I used up all the emergency med's I'd brought with me without any improvement and ended up in Raffles Hospital. Which is Another PLUS for Beach Hotel, as the hospital is within walking distance (but not for me as I couldn't walk), and only $5 by taxi. All the staff were very helpful and sympathetic to my condition. Unfortunately my incapacity put paid to most of the Trips and Visits we had planned for our holiday, and we spent a lot more time than we had intended, in our room. So it was a DOUBLE BONUS that our room was SO BIG and COMFORTABLE. My biggest complaints would have to be the AWFUL TV Reception, with only 3 of the 15 or so channels providing a signal that could be watched, and the VERY EXPENSIVE and Unsecure Wi-Fi facility. YES, I would stay there again, and YES I would recommend Beach Hotel to friends.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and pleasant\u201d", "Author": "Bryan H", "ReviewID": "UR123952351", "Content": "We chose the Beach for its large comfortable rooms after staying in a place with rooms which were too small.

The location is good however the service was terrible. It was my last day at Singapore, we asked the receptionist to call a taxi for us. And she recommend a taxi with the price of 45 Sing dollar. It was unacceptable, the normal price should be 20-25 Singapore dollars. 45 is too much even if they wanna add their service charge. We politely asked her to call a normal taxi for us and she totally refused and let us go out in the rain. Thanks to local people around for helping us to catch the taxi. I believe that a good customer service never treats their customers like that even if it is our last day at the hotel. Maybe she thinks that we will never come back so it's her last chance for a real \"steal\" from us. NEVER COME TO THIS HOTEL. that's all I say about Beach hotel.
