We don't normally stay in 3 or 4 star places as we travel a great deal (at our own expense): so this was a special treat, 5 nights B&B. Reception is lovely, olde worlde Berlin posh style: pleasant, helpful staff and room to sit and wait a while if you need too. The hotel is split into two distinct areas: one set of two lift covers two thirds of the hotel and another lift system takes you to the brealfast room and more rooms. We had to take the lift down from the 3rd floor and then walk across to some stairs to go back up to the 1st floor breakfast room: we could have used the other lift but we didn't! We booked well in advance and got a good deal. I did however have that sinking feeling when we started walking along the corridor to room 322: the smart red carpet ran out about 5 doors from our room and an old blue one took its place, and we seemed to have walked a fair distance from the lifts taking right angled corners at regular intervals, have we been given the cheap seats? There was no real reason to worry, inner courtyard view, but very quiet: shower room fine and the bedroom was neat, tidy and large enough for our requirements. The pictures of the Suits they advertise didn't look like our room though! Breakfast was simular to almost all European city hotels: on a grander scale than I'm used to though, large airy, bright room, plenty of staff and a good selection of the usual suspects both hot and cold to choose from. Self service but relaxed and un-rushed. I got what I paid for, no more no less: I'm sure the better, more expensive rooms are lovely, but the breakfast is the same for everyone: we don't stay in hotel rooms, we stay in places and enjoy the location, only sleeping, washing and breakfasting at our hotel.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAnother Hotel California\u201d", "Author": "Torrepinerolo", "ReviewID": "UR123494100", "Content": "There are a few Hotel California's around, some preceded the song, others came afterwards.

I arrived mid-evening and was thrilled to see the outdoor seating with holiday music playing and a small bar with bar service; great welcome experience! Check-in wasn't memorable but it was efficient. My room was nice and the bed was large (two full/twin beds made up a larger bed) but the bathroom was horrendously small. The shower was a walk-in and the doors closed around you. It felt like I was in a spaceship. Thank goodness I'm not very fat because I'd never have fit in the shower (the shower was my least favorite thing about this room). I did like the fact that the hotel was eco conscious, meaning you needed your key card to activate the lights in the room and the lights deactivated once you left for the day and took the keycard out. The breakfast was so-so. It was very crowded in the breakfast room in the morning and the breakfast room was a little confusing to find. I ended up not finishing my breakfast because I wasn't particularly enjoying children running all over. I'd have preferred the parents to seat their children and then sort out their breakfast rather than hold up the buffet line while waddling with them down the line. The other thing I disliked about this hotel is how LOUD the courtyard is at night and in the early morning. Forget leaving your windows open - the staff and guests are in the courtyard at all hours of the night smoking and the smell seeps into your room (gross). In the morning the staff is sorting inventory for the bar (or so it looked like) and it was VERY noisy and disturbing. The bar staff inside were not the most friendly. I never really got a warm feeling from their service and one night after I ordered inside and tipped the bartender well, I sat outside only to watch the bartender cater to two men who'd just sat down. Why had he not brought me peanuts and a napkin like he did for them? The Welcome Drink was a nice touch, but a little off putting that it was limited only to the hot wine. I don't particularly like hot wine, so this added offer was lost on me. The hotel is located just about a block from the pick-up for a hop-on-hop off tour. It was a nice tour and it was great that the drop off was so close to the hotel front door. All-in-all, I'd probably stay at this hotel again if nothing else, for the location. However, this particular part of Berlin has a Manhattan-type vibe to it where the shops are all upscale and too expensive to afford. There is a Starbucks around the corner and a delicious restaurant called 'Capone' within a block, not to miss.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "fleet, hants, uk", "Title": "\u201cHOTEL LOCATION VERY GOOD\u201d", "Author": "ies2995", "ReviewID": "UR121119101", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel in November 2011.

The beds are appalling at the hotel cali, small - your feet hang off the end (I'm only 5 11) and the duvet and pillows are the type of cheap, light items that heat up intensely after a few minutes, the pillows prevent sleep rather than aid it. I've never slept in a hotel bed that is less designed for sleep. Awful. Building work is clearly required throughout. The floors are so creaky, which is almost comical when you're walking in your own room, but try laughing when you're in bed and can hear everything above you. The noise coming through the ceiling and the walls is intolerable. 2 uk channels only, which isn't really up to speed with modern satellite services. And the wifi costs 10 euros a day! Not free unless you book direct. That was 40 euros for me. Room cleanliness was fine, although they tend not to change the little shampoo bottles very day, more like every other - so be sure to use half a day!

Friendly staff, good English. Hotel very clean, modern & good quality - parts were being refurbished when we stayed but no intrusive noise for guests. Excellent buffet breakfast. Ask for a room with a balcony - a bit more expensive but well worth it for the huge room, good views of Kurfurstendamm & fresh air (not noisy at all due to double glazing)!
