I've stayed just about everywhere. My friends and I try this one out. Knowing Westgate and being held hostage in their sales pitch I should have known better to stay here. You get \"Florida rates\" just to sucker you in. You have to go to several desks at check in which when crowded can take several hours. Yes, I said hours. They try and sucker you in to their 90 minute resort tour and you get complimentary Buffett breakfast. Do Not Do this. It's where they trap their prey!! It will turn in to hours of them trying to sell you on a timeshare. I didn't do it, because I know their game, being an expert Orlando Traveler and being previously sucked into it. The game room is ok, but the Ice Cream place is so far away that you should drive to it. The deli and sports bar are not impressive at all. I wouldn't even call it a sports bar. They sell drinks at a bar and they have a tv you can watch. I was put in a handicapped room. My husband and I are not handicapped. The shower was so small bc of the fold out seat. The beds were comfortable though. Checking out you have to put all your sheets and towels by the front door & take your trash to the trash closet. Oh did I mention you have to pay $9.95 a day plus a .70 sales, and .60 Resort tax for \"Resort Fees\" They will lie and said its for your Ammenity Card. I hope my review will help some travelers that don't know any better stay away. Look somewhere else. This place really isn't worth all the hassle and harassment you will get.

I was worried abt sales pressure, bugs, poor service, etc...whatever people have commented/complained abt. We exchanged thru II for a spring break week. We checked in on a Friday (May 30, 2012) leaving on Good Friday. Arrived at 3pm and check in was about 30 minutes...after we checked in, ushered to another counter and was asked if we wanted to sign up for a 90 min presentation. ABSOLUTELY NO PRESSUE AT ALL. The girl was very polite when we said no thank you. THAT WAS THE END OF IT...no phone calls, no pressure, like I read. I honestly think those reviews are from people who somehow got a deal and had the presentation as part of their package...well, you dont get something for free - you agreed to the presentation, full well knowing it was a sales pitch. Check out was a bit worse - we decided to check out on Thurs night, cuz we planned to leave very early Fri morning. Two guys behind the counter, about 4 families in line and it took almost an hour to finally get our chance. They should have called for help. Also walked away with our invoice - noticing it was someone else's - the guy must have entered the wrong room number. Got that sorted out and shook our heads as we left. Not the best impression upon leaving. We stayed in the 5600 building..it was near two different pools - Definately recommend pool #13 - and plan to reserve ur chair/table early in the morning (9am ish) cuz if you go later, all the chairs/tables are filled up. We stayed in what Interval listed as a 1 bedroom with LK (Limited kitchen) = translates to Studio.The pictures of the studio on Westgate's website are accurate of what our room looked like. It was a lock off, attached to a 2 bedroom. When we arrived, the lock off door was not locked. Got a glance at the 2 bedroom - it was very nice and we were envious. Called the front desk to ask to upgrade, could not since it was a holiday week and the resort was full and requested they come and lock the door. Someone was there within 10 minutes to do so. The room was decorated a bit dated, but it had granite counters in the kitchen and bathroom. Dishes/silverware/glasses/cups/dish soap/extra paper towel/tissue/t paper were provided, so we didnt have to buy any for the week. Room service showed up on Tuesday with fresh towels and to replace garbage bags/paper towel/tp etc. Would have liked a broom to sweep the floors. Nice screened in balcony = no bugs. Loved hearing the water fountain in the little man-made lake behind our building. No issues with parking. We ate off site every night - plenty of restaurants to choose from. Grounds were nice and clean. The location is one of the best things abt Westgate. 5 minute drive to Disney. About a 40 min drive to Cocoa beach/Kennedy space center. We didnt go to Universal or any of the other parks, but those were close by also. Definately a family friendly resort - so close to Disney and many restaurants.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cA Great Exchange\u201d", "Author": "Hongkonger65", "ReviewID": "UR128220802", "Content": "First off, like so many others, I was concerned about booking this time share property after reading the many reviews on Trip Advisor. We exchanged through the Interval International network for the spring break week and were prepared for 1) big crowds, 2) a time share pitch and 3) a so-so experience. This actually turned out great for us. The resort is HUGE and great for families who are going to the theme parks. Our daughter was playing softball at the ESPN Wide World of Sports and the resort is perfectly situated for that. On entering the main check-in area, we were pleasantly directed to the registration counter and everyone was very nice. We did not wait in line at all (approximately 1:00 pm on a Sunday) and it took only about 10 minutes to get our keys and be handed off to a very nice time share associate. This was very low key and when we said that we would not be available for the presentation breakfast, we were sent on our way to building 4000 (which is newer and close to the main reception area). There appears to be some construction planned for in front of the unit we stayed in, but that did not impact us at all. When you are at the parks, swimming or at sporting events all day, this is not really important. If we wanted a view, we would have selected another vacation destination or property. Our unit was a huge one bedroom (I assume a deluxe) with a full kitchen, laundry facilities in the unit and a large lanai. The flat screen TVs, jacuzzi, separate shower/bathroom and furnishings were very nice. It would have been great to have an extra toilet in this unit (it is obviously a lock-off), but that was our only complaint. We did not have any door bell ringing, but the walls are a bit thin and we heard our neighbors in the morning. As with most condo/time share properties, room cleaning happens once a week. We actually like this for privacy. If you book this property thinking it is a romantic hotel-type resort, you will be disappointed. If you are a seasoned time share exchanger, you may be very pleased (as we were). In addition, if you need transport to the airport, Caesar's is very good - affordable, convenient and courteous. Shuttles to Disney are limited, so a vehicle (especially with the large size of the resort) is a good idea.

For the most part I enjoyed my stay at this location! The facilities were modern, beautiful and clean! I was in building 5000 and it was immaculate! The parking was a bit difficult and no luggage carts to use when you need to load and unload your car but we managed to make it in two trips. When we checked in the first day we were ushered to a second employee to discuss a presentation (and since my friend was already an owner she knew the spill so we declined the offer for this presentation). We rested very well in the evenings and nights as the one bedroom unit we had was very comfortable and it was noise free. We did our own laundry while we were there and never asked for room service; if you place your garbage bag outside your unit door the service will pick it up by the next morning. If you ask for anything they offer they will try to acommodate you. The shuttle service to the disney parks could be better to accommodate people who want to stay till the finale fireworks or shows at night. I think it was very inconvenient to have to abide by their times only and enjoy the parks to the fullest. So we paid $14 or $15 per day to park our vehicle at the parks for 6 whole days. Check-out was simple; we cleaned our room as far as placing dirty linens in the laundry room and putting the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and turned it on, and placed any garbage bags outside our door when we left. A great place to stay! Shorts and Sandals was a great place to stop for a drink or food, great service and casual atmosphere. When you order food please prepared for very large amounts of food.

Let me just preface this review by saying the Westgate Marketing team is full of liars that really know how to stretch the truth. The first major negative of our trip was an unavoidable $65 taxi ride from the Orlando airport to the resort \u2013 it would have been accommodating of Westgate to provide some sort of free or reduced transportation to and from the airport for its guests, since the resort is roughly 25 miles away from the airport \u2013 but apparently that is entirely too much to ask. So we finally arrived at the (seemingly) beautiful Westgate Town Center around noon on Easter Sunday. Now don\u2019t let the exterior appearance of the resort fool you \u2013 the pretty landscape, the large, beautiful lobby, and the sophisticated-looking buildings \u2013 there is no denying that the physical appearance of the resort is beautiful. But after only a little time it became obvious that the Westgate people dedicate most of their resources into the appearance of the resort, rather than the happiness and comfort of their guests. Our first grievance with the resort came upon check-in. After we were checked-in by a young lady and given our room keys, we were immediately and UNWILLINGLY shuffled along a conveyor belt to another representative much like a cattle-call. We did not understand why we had to meet with another representative after we had already checked-in and gotten our keys \u2013 all we wanted to do was go up to our room and unpack after a long morning of traveling. Now this representative was very charismatic, and slyly talked us into signing up for a \u201c90-minute tour of the resort\u201d on Tuesday morning. We weren\u2019t sure why he was strongly encouraging us to sign up for a tour of the resort two full days after we had arrived, but whatever. We don\u2019t know how it happened, but he then swindled us into leaving a $20 deposit for our tour reservation! And after he rushed us through signing a pink waiver with a lot of fine print (that we did not have time to read), we came to realize that we were signing up for a timeshare sales presentation that we 100% HAD NO INTEREST IN BUYING. We asked some other guests what it was all about, and they urged us to AVOID the presentation at all costs \u2013 they told us that it was actually a high-pressure sales pitch to try to sell us a timeshare, and in most cases, the presentation lasted roughly 4-5 hours (not 90 minutes) and involved several managers and higher-ups that applied a great deal of pressure to buy a timeshare. After hearing these horror stories, we decided to skip the presentation and cut our losses, leaving the $20 deposit at the front desk. Our next grievance came with our room (located in building 5200). Let me just say that the architect who designed these rooms did a very poor job and was severely overpaid. Our bedroom wall was actually the front wall of the unit, meaning that our bedroom window was directly next to the walkway outside our front door. Being early to bed every night, we had a lot of trouble sleeping because we heard all the various noises of people and kids walking by our unit. We were also right next to a staircase, so anytime someone walked up or down the stairs, we could hear them right in our bedroom. The ceilings were also paper-thin, as we heard footsteps through our ceilings every time someone walked around upstairs. In addition, when we booked our stay at Westgate, we booked a king-sized bed in our room. However, what we received was a rickety full-sized bed, with a crusty old comforter and sheets as crinkly as sandpaper. The mattress was hard and thin, and gave very little support to a guest who would be walking miles upon miles at Disney parks all week-long. The televisions were old and outdated, the WI-FI was NOT FREE, and furthermore, the leather sofa in the living room area was filthy, with dirt and grime stains all over it. Our room was just flat-out dirty and outdated. But what really ticked us off the most, was after all the inborn cleanliness issues with our room that I just described, housekeeping did not come to clean our room until Thursday afternoon!!!! (again, we arrived Sunday morning). It took 4-and-a-half days for them to bring us clean towels and take out our garbage = GROSS! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! A couple other negatives \u2013 the pools were dirty and unkempt. There was a very nasty and impatient young employee named Alexandra that worked the lake activities area (she was quite rude to us). There were no sidewalk paths when we wanted to leave the resort by foot. There were golf carts zooming all over the place because the resort was so large and unwalkable. And finally, most of the clientele that stayed at the resort were not of the highest class (I\u2019ll leave it at that). The lone bright spot of this gigantic resort was the Sports Bar/lounge named \u201cShirts and Sandals.\u201d The food there was excellent and affordable, the portion sizes were large, the service was impeccable, and the overall atmosphere was friendly and fun. We ate three meals at this lounge and were very happy (and full) each and every time. In closing, I would DEFINITELY NOT stay at this resort again in the future, and recommend that you not either!", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "chesapeake", "Title": "\u201cworst place in the world to stay!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "bill j", "ReviewID": "UR127705410", "Content": "These people lie to you to get you in the door the room we booked was not what we thought.

Beautiful modern room. Close to Disney, Restaurants and Shopping\u201d", "Author": "2views", "ReviewID": "UR127630484", "Content": "I did a timeshare getaway vacation purchase for a 2-2-0 (sleep 2, occupancy 2, bdrms 0= Hotel Rm or Efficiency/Studio) at Westgate Vacation Villas. If you plan to visit Disney, this resort is about as close as you can get without being on the Disney property itself. Westgate Town Center is 3 blocks off of US-192, a major road with national chain restaurants and shopping, including SuperTarget, Walmart. I was amazed at the size of this complex. It includes several blocks with 2-level town homes, about 6 huge 8-story tall condo buildings which I estimate have about 720 units each, and the monsterous regal Town Center building which has suites, efficiency and hotel rooms. Additionally, there are various shops, eateries on the complex. Check-in is at the Town Center building. It is stated that earliest room check-in is 4pm. Knowing this, I planned to check in several hours after 4pm to avoid the rush, but as the day unfolded I arrived at exactly 4pm. There are 40 or so parking spots out front, but they were all full, so I continued on to the side of the building and walked to the front entrance. (A previous reviewer complained that there was no parking so he drove for over 10 minutes hunting for a space. There is a huge lot with ample parking on the side of the building. Understand that this is a huge resort accommodating thousands of guests. The front desk and parking area will always be busy. If you get that stressed about not getting the parking space closest to the front door, you definately need a vacation.) Once inside Town Center, check-in counters line the whole back wall of the entry with a maze of theatre-line ropes to coral guests. Unfortunately, there are too few staff actually checking guests in, so there may be a 30min or longer wait in line before making your way to the check-in counter. Once there, check-in was fast (10 min). I did not get approached about timeshare sales or special discount-offer meetings. But, having been to timeshare resorts before, I know better than to agree to these offers. A promised 90-minute max timeshare sales pitch is always 4 or more hours and, when you finally escape, you will feel totally exhausted and angry with yourself for not getting up and walking away sooner. The promised free meals, discount tickets, or other perks, are never worth the lost vacation time spent at these presentations, the stress of sitting through a 4 hr presentation, or the risk that you will be tempted enough to actually buy. (If you are new to timeshare sales, what ever fantastic price they offer, you should know that the same, or similar, units can be purchased from disenchanted owners on the aftermarket for 10% of what you will pay at the presentation.) The room I was given upon check-in was in Town Center #40xx, and for 1 or 2 people, it is perfect. I am posting pictures. Everything was new, spotlessly clean, and the bed was plush, one of the best beds I have ever had. There was a full size frig, 2 burner stove, micro, washer/dryer. They supplied a toaster and blender, too. I typically have blender smoothies for breakfast and margaritas for poolside. Unfortunately, the blender, although brand new, was unable to do any more than stir liquid, regardless of speed. I put a banana, strawberries, juice and ice cubes in the blender and tried all the blender speeds. The blades didn't touch the fruit or cubes, just stirred the juice in the center. (The plastic pitcher is too wide for the narrow blades) I had to shake the blender up/down in the air to force the fruit to find the blades. The free Tue pool breakfast is light continental, juice, coffee, cheap danish, oranges. Didn't appeal to me. The pools get crowded, noisy, and inconsiderate folks reserve pool lounges with towels early in the morning and never show up at the pool til later in the afternoon. The staff should, but don't, discourage this activity, or remove towels from vacated chairs. Unlike Las Vegas resorts, where pool staff are always visible, offering towels and drinks, and cleaning the area, I never did notice any pool staff during my week stay, and if they were there they certainly weren't serving the guests. When all pool lounges were taken, I put my towel on the lawn area next adjacent to the pool and found this to be quite adeqate, as did several other guests. As much as I would like to trust others, when at a hotel or resort, if I am leaving my valuables in the room, I always lock my valuables (cash, creditcards, ipod, camera, etc.) in the room safe. When I arrived, I noticed that the room safe power was out (batteries that control the lock were dead). I called maintenance and they dispatched someone within 20 min. Unfortunately, it was the wrong person, the one who can access your safe if you forget your passcode. She had to call the locksmith. I didn't wait, but took all my valuables to the pool with me. When I returned a few hours later, the safe was repaired. I consider this very good service for quickly handling such a minor issue when in the throughs of mass guest check-in at the front counter. Several reviewers complained about not getting daily maid service. This is not a standard hotel. It states in the material provided at check-in that linen service is provided only 1 or 2 times per week. This is an effort to lower cost for the resort and minimize impact on the environment. Hotels and resorts have been moving in this direction for the past 10 years. Frequent travelers already know this and many of us practice this at home. I don't feel the need to have bed sheets or towels laundered daily, at a hotel or at home. Do some people actually change there bed sheets every day at home? Although I had a rented car, I chose to walk fm the resort to US-192 for shopping and meals. It is only 3 blocks to US-192 and Golden Corral, Ponderosa, Sizzler, etc are only a couple blocks further. I actually walked to Target (about 4 miles away). That was a bit far. Next time I took the car. Check-out for me was at 5 AM. There was no waiting. It was quick and effortless. Overall, I would say that this is a fine resort for a family style vacation, especially if you wish to spend most of your time at Disney and area attraction. The complex is large, safe, has wide open landscaped spaces to walk, bicycles and paddle boats to rent, and a activites center for small children. There is not much to do at the resort but sit at the pool. I spent half my free time at the pool and half at the beach (Cocoa Beach, and Treasure Island). For those looking for a party atmosphere, this resort is definitely not the place. For that, head to the beach resorts, or another orlando resort.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whispering Pines, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cTown Center was EXCELLENT.\u201d", "Author": "babydec07", "ReviewID": "UR127626231", "Content": "We were hesitant after reading the reviews of others, but we were very pleasantly surprised and will stay in this resort again.

After we got home from dinner we decided to take the children to the game room and ice cream parlor. It was quite a long walk from our 5900 building and luckily an employee on a golf cart drove by and we flagged him down for a ride. He told us when we were ready to leave that we could walk to the front desk and someone from the bell staff would take us back to our room. NOT! Around 10:15 we went to the resort lobby and the check in line was still so back up that the bell staff told us they were too busy to take us to our building. So we had to hike with the kids (ages 6 and 3) all they way back to our room. The amenities of paddle boats and mini golf look fun...too bad they closed at 6:00! Pick another resort. This place was poorly organized with unaccomidating staff!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pace, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you like being lied to on a constant basis!!!\u201d", "Author": "Kenneth B", "ReviewID": "UR126618697", "Content": "I did one review already for Westgate Villas and then realized that wasnt even where we stayed. After being somewhat nice in that review, I decided to review the correct resort and just tell it like it happened. My fiance and I decided to take a trip to Disney with her sister and two boys (3 & 4 yrs old). We start looking for hotels and I think I have found a good one...Westgate Villas. We agree that this sounds like a great hotel but my future sister-in-law keeps looking and finds an even better deal. We were going to have another person traveling with us and she found \"Westgate Town Center\" with multiple rooms, a kitchen, and living area. This sounds great!!! I go to the website and I see that they have a Florida resident discount of 10%. I am proud for finding a good deal but she calls me a few minutes later and she has found a better deal. If we book early we can get 20% off the same room. The extra person cant make it so we decide on the one room deluxe villa. The more we read about the place, with all of these great amenities, the better it sounds and the price is just what we wanted to spend. So we are sitting around the house a few days later planning out our schedule for the Disney parks and we decide we are going to spend the entire day at Magic Kingdom from 9am - 12am. I make the comment that we were going to be late getting in and it would be nice to have the next day free to just relax. That got the wheels turning and we started looking at what it would cost us to add an extra day. I called and found that we couldnt get the extra day at the same low rate but we could still take advantage of the single day discount of 10% for booking early. So we did it. How did we get so lucky to find this you might ask.... It turns out we only thought we were lucky. We drive through the night and arrive the next morning after spending 7.5 hours on the road. We eat some breakfast and check out Downtown Disney just to kill time until 11:30 when I was told we could try to get an early check-in. We get to the Town Center and cant find anywhere to park. This must be a great place because there are people everywhere. After driving around for ten minutes, I ask a guy riding by in a golf cart where I needed to park to check in. He tells me to find a spot out front or parallel park along the curb. What a great idea, if only I could find an empty spot out front or see the curb to parallel park. Oh well, I just go to the nearest parking lot and park there. I tell the rest of the crew to stay at the car since it shouldnt take but a few minutes to check in based on my previous experience staying in hotels. Notice I said hotel, I was not aware that this was a timeshare resort. So I step into this elaborate lobby and just stand there looking around trying to figure out where I need to go. There seems to be people everywhere and it looks like complete chaos. Normally this is where I would expect someone at the front desk, directly in front of me, to be of assistance. Nope, that is obviously not part of the package at Westgate Town Center. So I proceed to walk toward the back where I see some ropes with a line. I wait in the line for about ten minutes only to be told that I need to go to a different line. So, I move to the other line and I am immediately greeted by a pleasant young lady who asks my name and gives me a sheet with my reservation information. Fast forward about 45 minutes and I finally make it to the check-in desk. Keep in mind that this is on a Sunday at 11:30 in the morning so it is expected to be a little busy. The gentleman at the desk takes care of all of my needs and confirms my resort fee charge of $68 plus the $50 deposit. He provides me with an extra card key and then calls for a guest assistant to help me complete my check in. The guest assistant takes me 20 feet to another desk where a VIP host welcomes me and commences to telling me about the mandatory 90 minute tour of the facility that was part of my vacation package. Funny thing is I dont remember getting a vacation package. I just reserved a room for six nights. Oh, there was some sort of mixup and I was booked as an owner so I am entitled to free amenities (I was told that was what the resort fee was for) and a welcome package. I would also get complimentary breakfast buffet and free meals at the pools. Wow!!! My luck is really good. I spend 90 minutes on a tour of the facility and I get a welcome package, breakfast buffet, and free meals at the pools. Maybe that mandatory tour wasnt so bad after all. So, when should I schedule this tour? On the extra day I reserved for us to relax after spending 15 hours at Magic Kingdom with two young children of course. The only catch is this is such a good deal that I have to give them $20 to reserve my spot but I will get it back after the tour...along with some gift cards. Well, I get it back and I just watched 3 other people somehow get the same great deal so what the heck. Ok, that is all taken care of and its only been 1.5 hours so lets go see the room. Up we go to the room and it is exactly what I expected. Very nice compared to the hotels I usually stay in. Back down to get the rest of the gang and show them how good of a deal we got and tell them about all the great stuff we got because of a mistake when they booked me as an owner of something. Now to check out this free welcome package. Six cookies!!! I feel like my 90 minutes is worthwhile already. After we got back to our \"villa\" after a long day at Magic Kingdom, we found that both the bed and the sleeper bed had been made, we had fresh clean towels again, the trash had been taken out, and everything had been straightened up after the two little tornados we brought with us had swept through the room the previous night. The next morning we attend our 90 minute tour that provides a horrible little breakfast buffet that even the kids wouldnt eat. Things started sounding fishy when some guy stands up and announces that someone had just bought a room and to mark it off the list. Our tour guide, er sales person, then starts laying it out for us. She has a great offer for us and we are so lucky to have been accidently booked as owners because that gives her the opportunity to offer us some special deals. Wait a minute, I am not interested in any special deals, I just want my $20 back and we will be on our way. Wait, we just gave you a free breakfast buffet, just give me a few minutes to explain this wonderful offer. Well, we're even then because we didnt eat your free buffet. Let me ask you, if money didnt matter, would you be interested in staying here at least two weeks every year in a room like we stayed in last night. Sure, it is very nice. Then give me a few minutes to explain. Sure, I agreed to 90 minutes so lets hear it. 4.5 hours later... No, No, and No, I am not interested in buying a timeshare, paying off a timeshare, or prepaying for a week vacation in a timeshare. I just want my $20 back so we can go get something to eat and RELAX. Ok, what price would it take to get you in on this great deal. FREE. Ok, let me go talk to my boss and see if I can work that out. Just forget it, I just want my $20 back now... So much for relaxing the extra day we paid for. As for the rest of our stay, our beds were never made again and the linens were never changed in 6 days, our garbage was never taken out again and wasnt even picked up when we left it outside our door. We ran out of toilet paper and when we called for it after the second day of using kleenex and napkins, they finally got some to us after over an hour. Needless to say, we didnt feel so lucky in the end when we got treated horribly after turning down their great offers. The room is definitly nice and it was well worth the price we paid but with our extra day wasted and the way we were treated afterwards, I would rather have paid twice the price and enjoyed my stay somewhere else.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cStay here for a week....but don't buy a timeshare!!\u201d", "Author": "MamaTraveler1", "ReviewID": "UR126469656", "Content": "OK here is what I would say about this place: stay for a week but do not buy a timeshare. My husband and I bought one here a few years back and upon our very first visit the following year, we regretted the decision. The staff is super friendly and accommodating while you are writing a check and signing the timeshare paperwork. But the minute you are an owner and you have any sort of issue or problem (and trust me, you will have issues and problems) the staff tends to get uncaring and often RUDE. You would not believe how many people I have dealt with there who had me baffled about how rude they were to an owner. If it was a random situation or one person I would never mention it....but SO many staffers there were rude and unhelpful so I feel it needs to be mentioned. Where owners are concerned, there is NO such thing as 'customer service'. None whatsoever. So be warned about that. The place tends to get REALLY crowded during holiday weeks. Yes, I know that can happen anywhere, but this was beyond the norm as far as I could tell. The pool was so crowded that we literally could hardly move around (and good luck finding a pool chair; there was like one chair for every 50 people, if that). My biggest complaint was the lack of someone working there to make sure things were safe at the pool. There were kids (and even adults) acting like animals in the pool, totally rough-housing and jumping off things they should not have been jumping off of. It was very dangerous and twice my daughter got hurt by careless people who were acting like lunatics in the pool. I felt that in those conditions, the place should have one person there to tell people to stop doing things like jumping off the center island into crowds of swimmers and wrestling in the water. We eventually left the pool because my child was hurt (we would have left anyway because it was a miserable place to be....not relaxing or fun at all). In situations like that, it would be nice for there to be an employee watching the pool and taking care of problems. At one point, early after our purchase of the timeshare, we were assigned to an agent who was seemingly very nice and helpful. \"Anything you need, you call me!..\" he kept saying, and he even gave us his cell phone number. We called him about something and he picked up immediately and was happy to help. He also picked up really fast when he was going to meet with us to talk about upgrading our timeshare (THANK GOD we didn't do that!!!). Then we had a problem....a big problem....and we went to management. We called our agent on his cell and....surprise!! He didn't pick up and after several repeat calls and messages to him, he never called us back. Years later, he still hasn't returned our call LOL. So I guess if you are happy, they are happy. If you have a problem, they are useless. We also were promised a lot of things at this hotel that were never delivered....things that were a huge part of the reason we bought the time share.They promised a big waterpark with water slides. Several years later, that park is still nothing more than some ugly poles sticking out of the ground. On our visit last year, they had a big inflatable waterslide but they charged a fortune to use it. So much for getting what you pay for. We were urged to go to \"one of the best dinner shows in town\" and when we got there it was like a converted strip-club. It was gross and smelly. The show was horrible and the food was enough to make me gag. I later found out that they are somehow affiliated with the hotel (perhaps the hotel gets money every time they get a sucker, er, customer, to go to this place?) We felt duped by them and mislead.....but at that point this was no surprise. Oh and their shuttles to the amusement parks? Forget about it. They have hardly any type of schedule (even during the busy holiday weeks, the shuttles hardly make any trips, and far from what would accommodate the amount of guests who want to use this service). The first day we were there we were told we couldn't get on the early shuttle because it was booked up and there wouldn't be another one. Thank goodness we had a car. Lame. They had an \"owners luncheon\" that was SO crowded because they were letting non-owners in (I know this for a fact). Halfway through the lunch they ran out of food. I could go on and on about the problems we had with this place but the thing that bugs me the most is the lack of customer service. We had a lot of issues there with our timeshare (things I can't even get into on here) and they just DO NOT CARE. At one point my husband was on the phone with one of their agents and she kept saying \"mmmHmmm\" to everything he said. She was totally disinterested in talking to him, You will find this from everyone starting at the clerks behind the desks to the top of management. They don't care about you once you sign the timeshare papers. Trust me, we had a lot of serious issues that they shrugged off. It is infuriating. The good things about this place are that it is pretty and it is close to a lot of things people go to Orlando for. It is easy to get to Disney from here. The hotel is very close to a lot of restaurants and shopping (which is a good thing since there are no real restaurants on site). The hotel is lovely in appearance and the rooms are very nice. But other than decor and location, this place is NOT all that great. In fact, the only reason I gave this two stars is because of the location and decor. But if it wasn't for those two things, this place would get one star (only because there isn't an option for less than that).I would definitely book a week here....but if I could go back and do it all again we would NOT buy here. No way. If we could sell this timeshare, we would have done so long ago (don't let them tell you it is easy to sell; it is not). I could go on and on about what I don't like about this place but I'll end it here. I highly suggest not buying here, though. I am not the only reviewer who has valid reasons as to why not. But the lack of caring and customer service (among everything else) makes me mad that we are spending our hard earned money on this place.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "camp creek, wv", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice!\u201d", "Author": "tlilly01", "ReviewID": "UR126401566", "Content": "Made my reservation and was in a very small room; but talked to the front desk and was moved into a perfect room for our stay.

Westgate Town Center is clean and spacious, both the grounds in general and the unit, itself. We used the pool, but didn't make use of any of the other resort facilities. We were in orlando for Disney World and that's where we spent our time. As for the timeshare pitch: We are not owners, but my MIL is and we used her weeks. One our first visit we attended the \"owner's breakfast\" and were pitched buying additional time. We made it perfectly clear from the start that we had no intention of buying and we didn't feel pressured. On our second visit we were asked at check-in to schedule a breakfast meeting and we declined because \"we didn't know what our schedule would be\" and because we would \"be spending so much time in the parks.\" We received one follow-up phone call voicemail, which we ignored. As for the unit: we LOVED having so much space. To be able to actually unpack all of our clothes for the week into dresser drawers and hang items in closets was priceless. Having a full kitchen, we did some minor grocery shopping and saved a ton of money by mostly eating breakfast in the timeshare each morning and by packing snacks to carry into the parks. Plus, on our non-Disney days, we cooked small meals in and enjoyed the space to relax. Sure, the decor looks like a Florida retirement community, but that's kind of the mood we expected -- teal, coral, pink, etc. The kids loved the jacuzzi (it was too cold to use the pool most days) and we stuck them in there in their swimsuits and they had a blast. Possibly the best thing about Westgate is the Location. With our kids, we left the parks each afternoon to return to the timeshare for naps. With our own rental car, we could buzz back from the parks, sleep for a couple of hours, and return to the parks.

We booked this through a hotwire deal that you couldn't see the hotel you were booking, but it would be a hotel similar to a Hilton, Hyatt, Wyndham, Westin, or similar. We have stayed at these other hotels, so we know what this type of experience should be. After we processed our selection the Westgate Town Center Hotel came up. We had not heard of it, but we were willing to give it a try. We started to do our research, and realized it was a timeshare condo type of place. A hotel in our opinion is much different than a timeshare condo. You know what to expect at the hotel (toiletries, cleaning service, beds, etc.), at a timeshare condo (or Villa as they call it) you have no idea. I made a call to Westgate to find out a little bit more before our trip. The phone number reached an central answering service, not the front desk of the hotel. The person did not know specifics regarding the place we were staying. This was concerning, but we were still willing to give this place a try. She told me we would be booked in a \"studio\" (again, this is not a familiar \"hotel\" type of stay) and the studio had a King size bed and a couch area. I asked if we needed to bring shampoo/conditioner, towels, etc. She did not know, but put me on hold and told me that the first shampoo/conditioner would be complimentary, but we would have to supply the rest. We also saw that we would be charged a resort fee of approximately $10 per night for amenities at the resort. The listed amenities were transportation to Disney and Universal, exercise facility, VIP services, ticket desk, internet, mini mart, game room, etc. (28 amenities listed on the site). At one point, we called hotwire because we felt that this listed as a hotel was not accurate. They said there was nothing that could be done. Now on to the actual trip.... We arrived around midnight because of a late flight. **note bring your itinerary to show the gate person so you can get it. We had ours, but this could make getting access difficult.** The front desk process seemed to go smooth, but the person at the counter claimed not to know anything about any of the amenities and services and said to come back the next morning (this was after having us fill out whether we were satisfied with her attitude in some sort of survey thing they give people). Although we mentioned several times to different employees through our trip that we had never been there, nobody explained any of the amenities to us or where to find things that we had paid a \"resort fee\" for. She gave us our room keys and sent us on our way through the giant compound known as Westgate. We arrived at our room and upon opening the door we found that we had two beds that were maybe full size. The bedding was scratchy, the room looked outdated, there was a mocha colored weird looking blanket, a loud continuous fan sound (the air was off), and a giant window that looked right into the room from the public walkway. There was no couch area. Here is a summary of what else we experienced (off-peak season): - Unfriendly service, no information when we arrived and everyone we talked to at VIP services was rude. - Definitely not a \"hotel\". - Not the same caliber as a Westin, Hilton, Hyatt, etc. - Fridge was broken - Air conditioner was okay, but loud - Walls very thin - Scratchy low grade sheets (I even had a burr in my bed that poked me for 2 nights before I figured out what it was). - Resort fee never mentioned by staff. Just given a fee summary at checkout. Also, they take a $50 deposit in addition to this at the beginning of the stay for incidental. - Cleaning service did not vaccuum. Only seemed to replace towels, which were small and poor quality. Definitely did not wipe down the bathroom floor either. At least not when we were there. Maybe this is the policy. Not sure since nobody ever explained anything about this \"hotel\" to us. - Security staff were the friendliest out of everyone we encountered. - The transportation to the theme parks is confusing. There are limited spaces available and you have to sign up for them ahead of time (at least a whole day) at VIP services. We went and signed up and the girl did not explain where to pick up the shuttle, how to get back (when I called to verify how we get back the guy that answered kept saying \"it's on the sheet\". They circled the departure time, but they did not circle anything for return. There were two times listed and a bus location number, but no directions. On the bus, the driver did not explain either. We found out that you bring your sheet to your departure driver (hang on to it!) and then you bring it with you again when you want to leave and stand at the location indicated on the sheet and show it to the return driver. They will not let you on if you do not have it. - Discount tickets are only available if you are going to a park for more than 1 day. It is worth buying them from hotel though if you do not wish to stand in line at the park. In order to get the discount you will need to sit through the timeshare speech. The ticket salesperson was helpful and nice and did not make us sith through this because we were only going one day. - Pool area near our room in the 5900 building was decent. Needless to say, the experience could have been a lot better. We were told very different things and provided comparisons that were not even close. This place might be decent for families though, but not for a couple looking for an easy get away.

We also have been staying at the Marriott Grand Vista on our last 2 family (12) adventurers to Orlando. We had an extra week to use from Interval International and decided to give Westgate Town Center another chance. What a pleasant surprise. Because of delays in Atlanta we did not arrive until 2AM. We had a brief discussion about our past experience with Westgate with the front desk person along with our current reservation. He apologized for our past experience and offered an upgrade to a deluxe 1 bedroom suite for a substantial discount. We were exhausted and decided to take the offer of the upgrade. The room was everything we expected ground floor and away from the pool noise. We had a full kitchen, large granite dining table and matching kitchen counter with eating counter, comfortable living room, king size bed with a Jacuzzi tub and large walk in shower with a waterfall and hand held shower head. Our porch faced a pond and a little used back road, for the most part a nice private quiet setting Our first impression on the way to lunch was the outdoor amenities, the pond with swan paddle boats. the put put golf with prehistoric animals through out and walking paths around the pond. We had lunch at the sports bar that has a great menu and excellent drinks. We walked the perimeter of the campus every morning and noted how well maintained the grounds were. Although we never inspected the two story units we staid in in 99, we were told that they were all in the process of being renovated and updated. There were several pools in our are to pick from but stuck with one for the week. It is a free style pool with a good size hot tub with several jets. You could order lunch and have it delivered to your location anywhere on the campus. We found the resort to be in location that was easy to get to all the attractions in and around Orlando. However on this trip we were not interested in the main attractions. We did go to Universals City Walk and Downtown Disney. Of the two, Disney was the better choice for the number of restaurants and entertainment along the streets. At City walk we ate at Bob Marly's and Disney at the House of Blues and would recommend both. Then the was Joe's Crab Shack on 192 a short distance from the resort. What a fun place to dine and again a great menu and drinks. We are not owners at this resort but noticed most all the activities were free to members along with a 50% discount at the restaurants. Our best advice is to use a GPS voice direction device. We used an app on my cell phone that made it easy to get around with no hassles.

I got the 2bdrm for $400+ for a seven night stay. Upon visiting direct website for Westgate Towncenter I saw there was a standard 2bdrm, and a deluxe 2bdrm. Of course deluxe was much nicer, 1200+ sq.ft versus 690 sq.ft for standard. Deluxe had larger kitchen with updated stainless steel appliances, and much nicer furnishings. I called resort directly to confirm reservation, I also asked about possibility to get an upgrade to a deluxe 2bdrm, and how much that would cost. (I was more than willing to pay a reasonable amount for upgrade) Clerk told me she was unable to do that herself, but she would make a note of it in reservation, and if upgrade was available, it would be furnished at no extra charge. Upon arriving at resort, you pass by Westgate Vacation Villas, which look like they have been around since the seventies, granted Towncenter more modern, but maybe eighties, nineties- more modern. When I checked in, asked clerk if I got the upgrade, she looked through reservation, smiled, and said \"you got it\". Upon arriving at room noticed immediately that it was standard room, not deluxe. I called to front desk, and said I was told I would be in a deluxe room, clerk replied, in not a great tone, \"did I pay for an upgrade\" I explained process from confirmation, to check in, and what I was told by two representatives from resort. She placed me on hold to investigate, when she came back on line, she said she did not know why front desk clerk told me that. I could not receive an upgrade, because none were available. Again tone of this person was dismissive, and condescending. I said thank you, and goodbye, and hung up, knowing I would get nowhere with this person. I did not pursue it, as I should have. My thinking was, Westgate clearly is in error, let them step up and acknowledge the mistake, and make good on it. They never did. That one incident soured the whole week stay. I was in building 5500, sixth floor. View was of lake/swamp depending on how you look at it. Ugly power lines, and a road with frequent, and load traffic noise. Plus and minus of the unit: PLUS: Very comfy bed in master bdrm Very nice shower in master bdrm large balcony, nicely furnished granite surfaces throughout MINUS: uncomfortable \"pleather\" sofa in living room kitchen appliances outdated-dishwasher looked antique, and so loud no coffee mugs ceramic tile throughout living area, had grout so dirty that it was completely black in many areas toilet in hall bathroom continuously clogged clothes dryer controls did not work properly horrible view(see above decor outdated-other reviewer here said \"golden girls\" that summed it up quite good Resort grounds were adequate, but could have been so much nicer. Pools were basic, 13, I believe they had. Better to do one spectacular pool, instead of 13 basic. Saw sign for proposed water park, looked promising. I cannot get over not getting upgrade to deluxe unit. If clerk told me upgrade was granted, then grant it. If clerk truly was in error, then offer SOMETHING to make up for her error. Hard to believe though that no deluxe units available, since resort was fairly deserted during my stay 1/07/12-1/14/12. Just an inexcusable failure on Westgates part.

Our 1 br deluxe villa is huge, nicely decorated, with high end finishes and amenities. Just being left several packs of detergent for the full size stacked laundry is something that makes traveling light easier, and it's the little things that make or break a vacation. Reading other reviews, I agree that our sleepy, jet lagged brains were jarred a bit by the immediate offer of a timeshare sales presentation when we first checked in. This is a well-oilers machine and you are definitely channeled past checkin to sales. But if you put on your big people panties and say NO THANK YOU, you can bypass all that and be taken by or follow a little tram where a pleasant young person escorts you through the maze of buildings to your room or suite and gets you settled. Very nice. Our suite is immaculate with tiled floors in living areas warmed up with tropical colors and rugs, the kitchen and bath have marble counters, there is a huge dining table perfect for planning a days activities (we always feel like an invading army, with our maps, coupons, and local papers, comparing attractions). The tub is big enough for two and then some and has color changing waterfall fillers and bubblers. A large separate shower and dressing room makes easy to all get ready at once. One way Westgate outshines Marriott is in the activities. There are many to choose from and the only challenge is that the place is so big it took us a while to figure out where various things were. No, we didn't ask, but should have as we missed some fun things like making a stuffed flamingo (I thought that would be a cheesy thing for little kids but the results, which we saw at the activities building, we're comparable to build a bear) and tie dying a t shirt. We did play their mini golf course which was just challenging enough to be fun but easy enough to allow for each of us to get a hole in one at some point. It winds around a lake with paddle boats and swan boats so it's scenic and relaxing too. You can rent bikes there as well We weren't in love with the breakfast buffet at Shorts and Sandals, some things were cold, but it was okay and convenient. The local grocery/gift shop is well stocked and, with a call prior to arrival, will stock your kitchen from your list at prices that aren't outrageous, something harried parents traveling with little ones should consider so they don't waste their first theme park day at Publix. What we thought was a problem with our shower turned out to be operator error. You pull out on the faucet and then have the option of standard, rainshower, or both. Once we reported it, they took care of it (pleasantly showed us how to use it). Only other issue was that the pool was too cool to my liking. The one by our building (there are 14 ) was mostly in shade and a kid told us it was cold. That was enough to keep me out. Summer months are probably fine. Full disclosure...we did buy here. Not at full price, but a deeply discounted unit in the older Villas area (we stayed in the newest building in Town Center). We will be back each March for spring training games and ESPN park is just down the road. The Braves train there so we will see our beloved Tigers training games when they are there and not have to drive to Lakeland. The resort is pet friendly and you see occasional dogs being walked, but I never heard barking or any of the sounds you might expect from so many people nearby.

There are numerous pools and other amenities at the resort, which we did not take advantage of. We did have dinner in the sports bar and found it to be a relatively good value. The main problem we have with this resort is their super high pressure time share pitch. We had to meet with, no less than 4 staff members before we were finally able to check in and get assigned a room. Each person had their own sales pitch and were so nice and smooth about it that we were signed up for the presentation before we knew it. We're seasoned travelers (and own several timeshares, tho not this one) so should have known better. I got sold by the free breakfast (ok, I was hungry when we checked in, so any mention of food got my attention!). The presentation the next day was very high pressure and we, again, had to speak with a procession of at least 4 more staff members who did not like hearing that we were not going to buy. My suggestion is Just Say No to all offers and avoid the sales pitch at all costs. The freebies they give you are not worth your time! We wasted an entire morning for a mediocre breakfast and a couple of discount coupons. The other problem we had was excessively long waits at the front gate - there were invariably a large number of cars lined up to get through the security gate, and the guards took their time letting people through. Even if you went to the gate that required only a room key, the back up was often very long. Overall, if you avoid the sales pitches, this is a great place to stay if you're going to Disney World, as it's very easy access to and from the parks. The property is very large, gated with secured entry, and easy to navigate.

Our group staying here was myself, husband, 26yr old son, 17 and 16 yr old daughters... we were meeting up with my 24 yr old daughter (she and her husband, 2 children and his sister and parents stayed on disney property) First, I have read about people getting less than friendly service at check in..we were excited to get to the resort after so long and I went in all smiles...yes, I was asked my name by three people (all of them smiled at me and forwarded me where I needed to go)...once I reached the desk (very quickly) I was helped promptly! I mention this because the woman who came in after me made a snappy comment to one of the ladies asking her name \" I've already given it three times!!\" and gave attitude. Now, it was true that we were asked that many times but this is a resort that has many venues... I could have simply booked a room, I could have bought a getaway, or I could have exchanged (which was the case). It stands to reason that there are many reason, including security, that you could be directed differently depending on how you were there. This woman did not have the happy experience that I had because she was not a happy person. Grumpy people make it hard to be friendly...just sayin... I declined the \"breakfast\"/sales event and was not pressured. The bell person was great and helped us take our luggage in. Our room was clean, and exactly as I expected with only a couple small quirks. 1. there was no fan adjustment in the bigger part of the unit (this really bothered my husband) 2. the dishwasher cleaned really crappy...it left a heavy film on the dishes and we ended up washing them by hand. not a big deal but could be to some. The great: there were a ton of towels... plenty of pillows...nice deck furniture... a full size coffee pot... washer/dryer unit...ice machine worked great...lots of space!!...very close to disney. The kids used the pool and found it to be great. They do not enforce the pool closing time which I find great for teens coming back after the parks all day. The only room that was really noisy was the girls room that was right across from the elevator and it did sound like people were in the room with you. After walking all day and then a swim they usually slept with no issues. There is plenty of water pressure and we never ran out of hot water. We went to a walmart (within 10 miles) because the local stores are pretty pricey. The activities are expensive! about $9 per person per time if you don't go to the sales show. we got the wifi for the week $39.95...(for ONE piece of equipment) we only used one laptop and it worked out fine... we were told that the McDonald's up the street does have free wifi, but we were fine with the fee...if the credit card you leave at check-in is a debit they hold $50 for the week, but you can apply your wifi bill to that. If you are using this place as a sleeping stop while enjoying florida it is great!!

First someone prepared our keys, then we were passed off to a concierge-type individual who pressured us to commit to attending a breakfast to get \"VIP\" (owner) benefits. We were then passed on to two (2) additional individuals before actually being taken to our room. We declined the breakfast, not wanting to lose valuable vacation time as we weren't interested in purchasing an additional time share. However, this is the only property where I have been an exchanging owner and was treated any differently than a property owner (and did not get the same privileges, access and perks) and that was disappointing. Our room was on the first floor of the \"town hall\" building where check-in and plenty of other activity occurs. While that limited our ability to relax, we also were called one evening at 10:45 p.m. by the on-site pizza shop three (3) times in a five minute period to see if we'd ordered a pizza. We indicated we had not, yet they kept calling. There are doorbells on the units which are appealing to small children and were frequently rung. The walls were paper thin and we could here the guests in the adjoining unit talk and eat. Every night at midnight, the sprinklers outside our unit came on. Other than the bathroom, the set-up of the condo appears cheap. The televisions are the tube-style, the appliances are bottom-shelf KMart brand, the pullout couch is made of pleather, and the bedroom is appointed in decor that was en vogue in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The thermostat is programmed for cost-savings and would not stay at the slightly lower temperature we wanted, which made sleeping uncomfortable. We did not receive any housekeeping during the week. Apparently this, like other amenities one takes for granted at a 'resort', is at an extra cost. Again, I've not encountered this at any of the other dozen or so Interval International resorts where I've stayed in the last decade. I've always received at least one housekeeping visit, about midway through the week. We left a day early and went to stay with my sister on the Gulf Coast. When my husband opened his suitcase to get his pajamas, a large cockroach came flying out of the bag, an unwelcome souvenir from Westgate.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cA great alternative to the parks for families\u201d", "Author": "poohkin", "ReviewID": "UR121178842", "Content": "My in-laws are owners here so we were given a week to stay in a 3 bedroom.

My in laws own 5 units and we still are hounded to sit through a pitch when we arrive and at least once during our stay. If you're not in a newer unit, the rooms are very outdated. They look like the Golden Girls' house in 1989. The service is not great. When we checked in, someone drove us to our tower, but didn't help with bags at all and there were no luggage carts to be found. Not a great experience for owners who traveled all day. They have been slow to make updates nd changes. We were sold on new restaurants, water slides and conveniences. Little has been updated in the 4 years we've been going. Lots of talk, little action.

Our stay this year was better than most. We do find the facilities to be well maintained and clean. We were also treated very well by the staff. I must say though that the sales department does not take no for an answer. As owners we are not obligated to attend the owners breakfast where we are \"updated\" on changes they want to tell us about. Word of warning, this is the hook to get you to listen to the same 90 minutes spiel about buying more! We go during the off season so the check in process is usually fairly quick. I would much prefer to just get my key and go to the unit. We have been there long enough and we know where we are going. We don't need someone to take us to the unit and turn the lights on and off and leave without so much as two words. We also don't need to stop at all those stations and get a welcome packet of brochures we typically just throw out. For first or second timers this is a great service but for us lifers please make it stop! Another word of caution is that in the Town Center buildings there is absolutely no insulation between the units on each side of you or above you. So you can hear every conversation, fight, fart, banging cabinets, and EVERY flushing toilet! The buildings must have been built as cheaply as possible so be warned, if you get noisy neighbors next to you or above you you will hear everything. Specially the whiny, crabby, crying children. You can bet a herd of elephants will be in the unit above you too! Another observation I have made and have seen no improvement on is the fact that pedestrians simply do not have the right of way at Westgate. The place is simply overrun with golf carts. They do not respect the pedestrians. I was almost hit several times. So watch your kids! It sure would be nice if they had at least one of the 14 pools designated as an adult pool, no kids, and no throwing things. Don't get me wrong, it's great to see families having fun together but when they are throwing footballs and frisbees from one end of the pool to the other it is very difficult for others to also enjoy the pool. The vast majority of people sure don't have very good throwing arms! lol. So again, be advised if you are not one of those families who take over the whole pool, find one of the lesser used ones. If Westgate should read this review, please figure out a way to have recycling stations where we can drop of our cans, glass, and plastic recyclables.

I rejected all of the offers except the last which was very reasonable, a well priced 1BR Villa vacation package with payments over time...I made my reservations and paid the extra $200 for a two bedroom villa so that my father and his best friend could come down as well (he needed a vaca in the worst way) So here's the goods: DO NOT, if at all possible, stay in the older section of villas unless your #1 priority is the 25% more privacy. When I went on the tour they showed me the Town Center rooms (the high rise looking over Disney property). When checking in I was given an older 2BR villa they said was newly renovated with several problems (thermostat broken, lights crooked on the walls, handles from furniture broken or missing...) I was in \"Here we go\" mode, so I called the front desk and asked to be moved to a different property, not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised at the quick response, and the gentleman who assisted me was very helpful. He showed me 3 different possibilities, all of which were nice, but the one we settled on was the exact room we had toured 3 years ago...from then on it was all thumbs up. The 5th floor high rise villa was fresh, well decorated, and very open (I'm a huge fan of open floor plans). Smaller but well furnished kitchen, mid sized balcony with a table and chairs (View was the best in the place tho phone lines took a bit away from what would otherwise be very nice), and a perfect sized living room with a large sectional and television. Master bedroom was a real treat. King size bed, mirrors everywhere, a large hot tub, dual head shower, 2 sinks, and an entrance to the balcony. Only downside was a very small toilet room. Lighting in the bedroom was on the \"mood lighting\" side, not incredibly bright, but sufficient. Second bedroom had 2 Full size beds, good view of the property, its own TV, and a very nice little shower/bathroom combo. Separate in-ceiling lights for both beds as well. The property is fairly large, featuring 13 pools (which were dead as it was off-season), a few places to eat, and tennis/volleyball/basketball courts. Each building has a pool nearby so you don't need to walk far if you want to swim or hop in the jacuzzi. The food, from two restaurants that we sampled (Having the vacation package entitled us to be \"Owners\" for the week and as such we had a large discount on meals and activities, some of which were free) was very mediocre so we decided not to eat on property. There were various activities that we did not participate in such as crafts, a Dinosaur themed mini golf that was very low skill level but a nice diversion for kids and families, catch and release fishing, paddle-boats, and more. Again, it was off-season so there wasn't much traffic at the resort in general. The resort is very close to Disney, but offers very little in terms of transportation, so if you want to make your own schedule, you will want to plan on driving or getting a cab anywhere you want to go. The shuttle service to Disney, for example, had one bus leaving in the morning which you had to register for. The returning bus could only be used by those who used it in the morning and still only had one departure time at night.

Go for the tour but do not be pressured into buying-the price drops if you hold out. It is worth the cost though if you add up the price of a week's holiday here compared with the timeshare deal, which you then have for ever (to pass on in a will) to use every year or exchange to any other Westgate property. It is only a couple of miles from the Disney parks and approx half mile from shops, restaurants etc. The only problem we ever seem to have is the check in process, which takes for ever to get to the front of the queue and you are then passed along a \"conveyor belt\" of people all trying to get you to come to the free breakfast which is the time share sell. My word of advice is NEVER do this breakfast the day after you arrive as you need to be fully rested to understand the selling patter that they bamboozle you with. It is worth a couple of hours of your time to get the discounted park tickets but say you will come around day 3/4 of your stay. A great stay every time and because of the washer and dryer you need not pack half as many clothes, leaving space for souvenirs.

You definitely need a car as nothing is walkable, even for the fittest person, but this is standard for wherever you stay in Florida.

We travel a lot and this works for us. We went in knowing that Westgate has the worst reputation for high salesman pitches! However, they were no different then any other timeshare presentation we have been on. Our sales guy was great and not at all high pressure!

It was clean, full size washer and dryer which was nice. I will say even though the room was nice, it was a tad dated comparing it to the other resorts we had visited in the past few years ... Orange Lake, Mystic Dunes and Vistana. All 3 of those hotels were much nicer. But with that being said, Westgate was still nice. The worst part of our room is that we were outside pool 13 and it was SOOOO loud! One night I called security at 11am and then again at midnight. It was just unbearable. I was annoyed no one came the 1st time and I had to wait an hour for security to show up. Pools on that particular day closed at 10pm. There is a Thomas the Train that circles the property during the day giving rides. The kids are big Thomas fans so that was a pleasant surprise! We used it to go to the overpriced market too. A nice bonus. There a lot of activities on site. We did do several of those and enjoyed it. We did the free owners BBQ one afternoon and it was packed but the line moved quickly and it was good for a free, fast meal. They also served FREE Coke, Lemonade, Water and Beer from 12-2pm. We also did the owners breakfast (both at pool 13) the morning we left. The kids enjoyed it. I would recommend this resort.

Several pools on property and lots of amenities. There is a mini golf course, paddle boats, swan boats, gofl course, restaraunts. The bad--this is a timeshare resort. It took us one hour just to check-in. There were literally hundreds of people in the lobby, which is massive, with several different desks and areas where they try to talk you into signing up for a timeshare sales pitch. I actually booked my room last minute via a secret deal with Travelocity, so I didn't know what I was getting myself into, which I will never do again after this trip. We waited in line for about 40 minutes, then when it was our turn at the desk, they couldn't locate our reservation from Travelocity, so we had to wait another 15 minutes for them to find it. We were given a room that was only part of a larger suite, and doors leading to the other part of the suite (which was occupied by another family) were unlocked. We knocked on one door to let them know, and as we were explaining to the gentlemen that the door wasn't locked, a lady from his party walked into our room from another door that led into our bathroom. This door had been locked on our side, so that we couldn't open it, but it was the door to the toilet, so our \"room\" did not have access to a toilet. The man also told us that they had been in our room b/c they had been told that they had the entire set of rooms. We called to let the front desk know that our room was not secure from the larger part of the suite, then called back to tell them about the lack of toilet. We were placed on hold for over 10 minutes, so we went back to the front desk (which is quite a distance away) and they switched our rooms.

We flew into FLL and rented a minivan and drove up to the resort arriving at 1:30 a.m. Arrival/Service- At that hour one would expect quick service and no delay, but we requested a room on the WDW side of the Town Center so we could see the evening fireworks. Our concierge wanted to please us, but the room was under inspection (at nearly 2 a.m). We waited for 45 minutes and then he wanted to put us in the original ground floor suite - not. He corrected and at about 2:20 we were in. The Room- the next morning we were very happy with our suite. Spacious, clean, great view of Wilson Lake and WDW fireworks. We were near the pool with a snack bar, across the street from the mini golf and swan boats, activity center and fishing. The train stopped out front too- but it was basically a train to nowhere- just ran around the resort with no narration to point out the landmarks etc. There were hundreds of golf cards moving staff and timeshare tours though. AC worked fine and suite had a washer and dryer. The pool towels were small and thin, no tea pot or cookie sheet found, and the dishes were all glass (not my preference)- mugs for coffee small (Irish coffee glasses). We had room 5451 and the last couple of days one of the elevators was broken. They were painting and blowing leaves, planting flowers etc, throughout our stay. Services- They had mid week towel service which was nice but not necessay as the wasker/dryer was there. Service was slow at the pool bar and you had to carry cash as they would not let you charge it to your room. The activities center closed down at 7 p.m., which is way too early as the best time to do some minigolf is after dinner. They should remain open until at least 11. Movies in the theater- same thing. A later showing (9ish) would have been nice. The daily shuttles to Disney were at 9:15 and 12:30, with scheduled returns at 5:30 and 7:30. They filled up fast and we were not able to use them at all. The 30 weekly fee to use the facilities is easy to recoup if you golf a couple of times. Overall, I would rate the service as just average. We had a slow toilet drain one day and though the guy came and fixed it fairly quickly, he wanted someone to wait while he sent housekeeping to \"clean\" . Forty five minutes later no housekeeping and we went about our day as we felt we had wasted enough time. The resort is big- it was very crowded at the pool nearest us. It was really hot too, so the playgrounds were unusable due to the sun. The had a huge water slide-inflatable, but it cost 2 dollars a trip or 10 dollars an hour- direct sun. We opted out. We did not eat at any of the restaurants, but we did get snacks one day at the pool bar. Not impressed by service or prices there. Pools- there were a lot of them. The pool bars serve dark blue napkins, which invariable ended upo in the pool by mid afternoon. Not much shade available and very crowded. The hot tubs were pretty gross with mulch dragged in by folks who couldn't walk around or keep their kids from walking through. The kids'/wading pool with a watering umbrella was cold. Our waterbugs couldn't stay in there long. Pools open late- no lifeguards, few rules. Adults must keep a close eye on their kiddos- many did not. Location- one mile from Disney-as the crow flies- but in reality it is about 7-8. Parking 14 dollars a day at any park. There is not a good grocery story with bakery and deli nearby and the liquor store is pricey. Go once early in your stay to International Drive and get food and snack and alcohol. Plan ahead and you will be fine. There is an Edy's ice cream and discount gift shoppe about 3/4th of a mile from the resort. If you want luxury- skip this place, but if you want roomy, mostly clean comfort for a family, this will fit the bill. There is a good 3G network, so if you don't need a laptop and have an I phone save the ridiculous internet fees. Oddly enough, we were NEVER contacted one time about doing the timeshare tour!

The 1st time we stayed in the Vacation Villas in 2008. This time we stayed at the Town Centre, which is all part of the same complex, the Villas are two buildings, while the Town Centre is 6 to 8 storey buildings. For the most part our stay was fine. We arrived later in the evening on a Monday and check in was a breeze. No timeshare pressure, nothing, although they send you to three different people prior to someone taking you to your room, but still took less than 20 minutes. We had booked a 2 bedroom suite from Expedia.com. The suite was nicely maintained, pretty clean. Two double beds in 2nd bedroom, I think a queen in master room, and pull out couch. Well stocked kitchen. Bathrooms had plenty of towels and toilet paper. The only down fall was that this suite faced a very busy, very loud pool. The first night, since we arrived later and were very tired, we did not call security, but the 2nd night it was even louder, there were lots of young adults in the pool and hot tub. Around 2:00 a.m. I called security. Security claimed that the pool gates were \u201clocked\u201d every night and that the people must have \u201cjumped\u201d the fence. Somehow I don\u2018t think that the pools are locked, because you can hear the gates slamming shut when someone opens them. But security said they would send somebody and they must have because it did quiet down. The next day (Wednesday) I asked to be moved to a quieter building. They moved us no problem. Second unit was great too. The only issues with that suite was that some maintenance guy rang our doorbell at 12:45 a.m. Saturday night to ask if we had used the hot tub in the past week, and then mumbled something about a leak in the unit below us and left??? Not sure exactly what that was about. We had our infant daughter with us, so I was NOT impressed with that! The 2nd issue was also on the Saturday. New people moved in above us, and it was like a heard of elephants. They were awake until 4:00 a.m, screaming yelling, jumping, running, etc. The walls and floors are very hollow. Sunday night same thing, finally called security about 3:00 am. After that night, they were okay, you heard a bit, but it was manageable. Every morning, housekeeping came by to take the garbage and see if we needed new towels. Everyone we encountered was friendly. We did get a timeshare request late in the day, the day before we were suppose to leave. A man called saying I had to sign a sheet saying everything in the unit was in working order, so I met him at the main club house, and after a few minutes realized it was a timeshare pitch, I just politely declined, stating that we did not travel often enough to invest in a timeshare. Besides, now that we had a baby, we needed to put money into her education savings. He was fine with that and I went on my way. If we ever go back, I will know to decline that phone call. We used several of the pools on the complex. Being March, they were all pretty busy. All of them, except for one were warm. Warm enough so that it was comfortable for our 11 month old. We walked around the complex quite a bit and it was nice. The only thing what would have been nice, would be for Westgate to add a children\u2019s splash and play area, the kind where little kids can sit and stand and play in water not too deep, but I think that they might be adding that when they start construction on the water park. Check out was quick and fine. Although the young girl at the counter had as much personality as a wet dish cloth. To my way of thinking, if you are in the hospitality industry, then you should have people who are friendly and outgoing, especially at the check in/check out desk, which by the way is different from the Guest Relations desk. The Guest Relations people I spoke with were friendly and very helpful. The only other complaint I have, like a lot of other people is that they charge $40.00 for internet for 7 days. Which is expensive. If we were to go back, next time I would request a room in the Villas, which are presently being renovated.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBe prepared to commit half of your precious vacation day to the timeshare speil!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Real_Talk1174", "ReviewID": "UR100931735", "Content": "Not too bad for the price, but they need to truly raise the standards for cleanliness and the 5 HOUR (yes!!!! 5 whole hours) timeshare presentation was \"simply put\" a passive aggressive kidnapping or hostage negotiation. We arrived during spring break. The only time off that we have during the year. We were excited to stay with Westgate because we had vacationed there with my father the year before at the Westgate Lakes and loved it! So, we booked a 4 day/ 3 night, 4-br/ 4-ba condo to accommodate the 12 ppl in our party. The price and amenities were awesome ($190/ day for 4-br/ 4-ba) & couldn't be beat! The staff were extremely courteous (as I changed rooms twice because of noise and lack of view). However, when we did settle into our rooms, you could tell that the room inspection meant (check for beds made, fresh towels, and clean tubs-only) because no one had wipe down any of surfaces or even attempted to mop the floor or clean the mirrors or wipe down the grime on the doors. Notice, I keep saying \"wipe down\" because that's all that it took, had someone \"inspected\" the room like a guest and not an employee with sub-standards for clean. We spent the next hour doing what housekeeping should have done. Other than that, no other issues with the resort. Let me add, the kitchen was immaculate! The location was wonderful, just a short drive to Disney and there were other stores and restaurants nearby that made for ease of travel. So, why isn't my rating a bit higher?!?!? Two-words, Timeshare Presentation!!!!! Now, don't get me wrong, we already knew before coming to FL that we were probably gonna purchase, if the price was right. We even told the \"used car salesman\" type, \"Joe\" that he wasn't gonna have to work to hard, just show us a 2 br villa like my Dad's and let us know how much? So, Joe ignored our request and went in for the \"hard sale\". Again we told \"Joe\" that all of the \"pitching\" was unnecessary and to give us the bottom line, how much?!?! But being the passive aggressive, tunnel- visioned, \"used car salesman\" he was, he just kept going. Finally after having heard all about the owner, who he knows, \"Joe's\" personal testimony, every inch of the resort, being asked to wait for over 20 mins and given the whole \"deed\" speil, we finally figured that we had to match his aggressiveness with some of our own and demanded to know HOW MUCH?!?! (Not realizing that we have been there for four hours. We started at 7:30 am, it was now 11:30 am.) So finally, (after seeing that we were irritated and ready to say, we will do this some other time), \"Joe\" and his supervisor began with the \"bait and switch\" show about slashing payments and preferred weeks and upgrading to a 2 br w/ loft villa. Before we closed on our deal, we had been there 5 HOURS. So, instead of being excited about our purchase, we were tired, angry and irritated that half of our day was gone! Folks, our timeshare presentation started at 7:30 am, we were not released until 12:45 pm, and \"Joe, the used car salesman\" was so aggressive that even after the sale was OVER, we finally had to MAKE him leave us alone by complaining about how long it took and how we told him we wanted to buy, but he DRAGGED on forever. Once we got outside, it truly felt like we had been set free or released from some kind of jail or maybe even Hell. I wish that I could have made this shorter for you. But I wanted to give an accurate review. By the way, we decided that we needed to wait a year before purchasing, after all. So we opted to cancel our contract four days after being home. The timing for us just wasn't right and our contract had a 10-day cancellation option in it. Let's hope everything goes smoothly with it...I would hate to have to call the State AG's office, as I would one day in the near future truly wish to become an Owner at the Westgate Town Center without being held hostage by a desperate salesperson, that is.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWe were thrilled with our total experience at Westgate\u201d", "Author": "smadden11", "ReviewID": "UR100363226", "Content": "Having read a number of the reviews here we didn't know what to expect, but everything exceeded our expectations.

There was what looked like coffee and leaves in the kitchen sink. There were lots of towels and pillows. The beds are a bit hard and the kitchen was a bit tight. There are a lot of pools at this resort and there was one right across from our room. However the pools by the towers have a kids splashing pool and are much more up to date so we drove over there and used that one after the first day. There is also a train they told us that would take you around but it runs very limited hours and after about 2:30 it really only does a loop from the front to the employee building for them to get off and on. Also the shuttle to the disney parks runs only two times in the morning. It is very close to the parks and several places to eat. There is also a super Target close by that is great for stocking your room up. The time share pitch was ok. We had a guy named Joey who did all the normal things like tell us about his personal life to make him seem like our friend. But he talked fast and his spiel was over quickly. Also when the guy was brought over to give us the price and my husband said no he tried a bit to get him to change his mind but did not get too pushy. He was obviously a bit annoyed but it was not too long. He also told us about the other building that they normally take people who are not staying at the resort he said you don't want to go there.

After checking in we were escorted to the \"other\" desk where they attempt to get you to take in breakfast or brunch to sell you a timeshare. We are from Florida and know the whole gammit so declined....but then we were told we would be escorted to our room by another employee! I thought to myself, WOW, they are really trying to sell these units! (not a bad thing...that's how they grow) We arrrived to our building and the escort couldn't locate our room (on the first floor). The key and room number on his sheet didn't agree. He was persistent to get us settled and tried every room on the floor (he tried everything AND we were saved from the sales pitch to attend the timeshare presentation). Apparently the check in host didn't program the key. So, tired kids in tow, we loaded up and went back to the main building at Town Center. Since he had to re-program the cards, my husband suggested we get a higher floor because of noise, etc....they accommadated us and we proceeded once again (tired kids in tow) to find that they assigned us a room with only one bedroom, we booked a 2. We go back to Town Center and they told us we booked a 1 bdrm. They call a supervisor and instead of speaking to me (I'm right next to our ESCORT) she tells him our reservations state a 1 bdrm. I look her in the eye and explain that we are very tired, it's now 10:15 and we will pay the difference if we have to, whatever...get me to bed! She says that the room has to be cleaned and inspected and it would be an hour before we can access...ok we'll go to grab some stuff from the store..cranky kids in tow (6 & 8). Come back at 11...different escort...very nice and helpful settling us into our room, he helped unload our bags and refrigerated purchases. My daughter goes to her bed to lay down and shrieks ROACH! A big one daddy! The escort was still there and saw it in her bed! He sat down immediately and phoned the front desk...yes we live in Florida and palmetto bugs live here too...but not in our beds! So here we go again, this time gathering all of our unloaded stuff, everything! Quickly! (so we don't have any hitchhikers!) The escort spared us the pain of going back to Town Center Hall to move rooms...he opened our new room in the 6000 building, and after a thorough check we were ok with it..he left and returned with our new keys within 20 min. Stellar service (from the escorts) at this point. So I mentioned earlier they said we booked a 1 instead of 2 bdrm...we had to pay an additional $84...even though it was their mistake. Well, since we didn't offically get a room until 12:30 Saturday morning you bet I was calling another manager. After notfying her of our experience she refunded us for the night...good move because word spreads quickly. Overall - It was a scary place to sleep for the first night, no roaches or issues the rest of the stay (3 nights). I would say if we didn't go through the first night the way we did, it would have been a diffrent experience. First impressions are lasting. One other key thing - we were not the only ones complaining. There were several people that we heard complaining of ants in their bed, etc...this is Florida and there are bugs - but ROACHES in the bed..NOOOOO. The premises were kept well (should focus that effort on interiors as well). The staff, except for the first supervisor encounter, were customer service oriented. We survived.

Especially if you don't want to got bankrupt at Disney! I will be honest...I am an owner of this timeshare, sort of, however, I'm not biased to them because I am also a travel planner so I look at everyone. Im only 28 years old and I have vacationed in the Orlando-Kissimeee area about 8 to 9 times in my lifetime so I know what I'm talking about! I'm gonna break this down in parts: RESORT - IT IS A TIMESHARE!!!! So, YES, they are going to try to get you to go on a timeshare tour! Depending on your vacations needs it might be worth it. We went on a timshare tour and we saved about $50 (maybe more) or our Disney tickets! For me, that was a good deal. I took that $50 I saved to the outlet mall and got some killer shoes and beautiful earrings! Anyway, if you don't want to take the tour then just say no. BE CAREFUL WHEN BOOKING! Certain rates you book require that you go on the timeshare tour, some don't. (Contact me and I can help you with that!) Anyway, the resort is AMAZING! Everyday there was a boat load of stuff to do! Free Disney movies, fishing, paddle boats, golf, BBQ's by the pools and a daily list of activites. They keep you busy so you don't have to spend all your cash at the parks. The resort is large but there's transporation to take you around if you don't want to drive your car. Or you could walk! We walked and the scenery was awesome! There was Pizza Hut and grocery store with deli near our villa but I heard there was another restuarant on the property. They are in the process of building a waterpark there too. It was ready yet so they've rented a HUGE water slide until its ready. ROOM - I didn't want to leave! We had a 1 bedroom villa with a patio. My husband and I's bedroom had a jacuzzi tub that was sooooo relaxing! The bed had dozens of pillows, mirrors over the headboard with some soft lighting. The bathroom had 2 shower heads, regular and rain shower. Double sinks were a blessing! We had a flat screen TV in our room and our room had its own entrance to the patio. The living room had a leather sofa sleeper and love seat. We put those two together to make beds for our then 6 year old and 3 month old daughters. They also had their own flat screen tv, DVD player, and music sound system. There was also a full dining table for 6 and a breakfast nook type table on the other side on the kitchen counter. The KITCHEN! Oh, how I LOVED that kitchen! Electric stove with oven, dishwasher, garbage disposal, microwave, appliances, refrigerator with icemaker, washer AND dryer, and all the cookware and dishes you need! They even provided detergent for the laundry and dishes! There was also a safe, broom, mop, laundry basket, iron with ironing board and all the regular and pool towels you could ever need! LOCATION - Disney was literally around the corner, I'm serious! It took us 5, maybe 10 minutes to reach the parking lot gates. We were 2 minutes for the main strip with all the restaurants, shopping, and WALMARTS!!!! And everything was a quick hop on the expressway. Airport was about 15 to 20 minutes away. SERVICE - They gave us such great service that I mailed them some customer reviews when I got back home. We had some issues with our room and everytime they came right away and fixed what needed to be fixed! One issue was with our toliet and they were having some trouble fixing it so they were going to move us (themselves) to a better room! They eneded up fixing it and it stayed fixed the entire time!

We rented a car and drove straight from the airport. We arrived around 6pm. Check-in was fast and easy. An employee provided us with an envelope full of stuff and told us about the free breakfast and bar-b-que and free activities. I suspected this was a timeshare presentation and immediately told him, \"Not attending either.\" He said activities would not be free, but nobody asked us again. An employee accompanied us to our room. That was nice. At first sight, we were disappointed in our villa. We have owned for only 3 years and have exchanged 3 times. This exchange has been the least elegant we have encountered. I didn't realize that the villas were the oldest accommodations. And, ours did not have a patio or a balcony! The decorating was cheezy and dated. The TV's were tube-type. Our previous exchanges all had new, slim LCD TV's. Furthermore, the internet cost $40/ week. We have always found internet to be free. My husband had his \"card\" with him so we could use the laptop in our room. Westgate provided a \"computer center\" in which you could load a card and use it to access the internet ($.20/minute, $.75/printed sheet). Using that card I accessed my e-ticket to print my boarding pass for the next day. I ended up spending $12 to accomplish this. Frustrating and ridiculous!!! That said, the villa was clean and quiet and spacious. We were in building SSS and the pool/jacuzzi area was hardly used the week we were there. The pool water was a perfect temperature the jacuzzi clean and hot and bubbling. The grounds were beautiful. We bought a couple of things from the market. We bought most of our groceries from a nearby Super Walmart. The benefit of buying at the market is smaller sizes. We didn't consume all the meat we purchased or use up the condiments. Probably would have paid the same money for smaller versions--but, I hate to waste food. We were not provided with a TV Channel Guide. I called and was told I would have to go over to the Welcome Center and pick one up. Why wasn't that in the envelope full of stuff? There were a couple of channels that were not listed on the guide. Another aggravation was a couple of pools advertised \"happy hour\" 5-7. We went over on Saturday night to one pool and the bar was closed. We were directed to another pool. That one was close to our room and was open. We returned to that pool on Tuesday (where a sign advertised food and happy hour) and the bar was closed. It was sprinkling and we didn't feel like walking to the other, more distant pool to check it out. Some consistency would have been nice! My experience with villas and timeshares is there is no daily cleaning and we put out our own trash. That was true at Westgate. Clean towels were provided half-way through our stay. That was nice. The queen-sized bed was comfortable, but a hallway light just outside the bedroom window interfered with our getting a good night's sleep all week. Black-out drapes over the horizontal blinds would have helped. Loved the security gate on the property. The resort is also very centrally located to many attractions. If we return to the Orlando area, I will probably research other resorts.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Richmond, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNice place but know what you are getting into!\u201d", "Author": "bearpawqs", "ReviewID": "UR91116177", "Content": "We have been owners here for 5 years. While the resort is very nice you need to know what you are getting into when you stay here. Our visit this October was less than stellar and we have made our experience know to management so hopefully they will do something about the customer service and attitudes of some of the staff. My first piece of advice is unless you know you want to buy a timeshare, don't go to the sales pitch. It is very high pressure and when you say no the pressure intensifies. Each time you say no they bring out someone higher up the food chain. After saying no to three different people their attitudes shift and they become rude and unprofessional. If you are really serious about buying a timeshare, shop around first. We actually prefer to stay in the Villas. Yes they are older but they are quieter and more our speed. The high rises in Town Center are cheaply made for what you pay for. You can hear your neighbor\u2019s conversations and you can hear the people above you walking, running, jumping, or moving furniture. There can't be any type of insulation or sound barriers. We requested a unit on the top floor but in so doing we had to wait four hours to be checked in. The front desk was not helpful and the customer service skills that day were pathetic! The staff at the Deli/Store was fabulous. They greeted us with smiles and welcomes and the Deli staff remembered our preferences and our names! They were great. The grounds are nice enough. Very neat and clean. If you have children just be aware that the grounds are really not set up for pedestrian traffic. What look like sidewalks are not sidewalks but golf cart highways. They will run you over if you aren't watching. Just another reason why we prefer the Villas. (Shh, don't tell anyone) The maintenance crew was also excellent and johnny on the spot with things that needed fixing. What we really like about the timeshare is having a full kitchen to make our own meals, we can do laundry as we need to and actually do it before we leave instead of having to do it all when we get home. Plenty of room to relax and close enough to Disney to enjoy what they have to offer. So why would I not recommend this place to those I care about? The high pressure sales, staff copping attitudes, poor customer service, and Westgate has not proven to us that we made a wise choice! Oh yeah, their internet service is basically non existent.

It turns out they were, but needed to be unlocked, while this key was went and got or this person needed to go and unlock the doors to the attached rooms. It was just too much chaos for the us and several of the children we had with us. Then, as I went to get into bed that night and pulled the covers back the sheets were covered in all kinds of I don't know what. It looked like little spots of blood clustered near the top and lots of little dark brown specs of dirt. At 10pm, after a long day, quite exhausted, my mind immediately went to bed bugs. I was upset and furious and called to get new sheets. While waiting, my sister and I scoured the bed and frame to see if they were bed bugs, and were relieved that we didn't find any. After waiting over 30 minutes for the sheets, the doorbell rang and we were handed a plastic bag. It was ridiculous that we then had to try an make the bed with the wrong size sheets! We were too exhausted to call down for another set, and I just slept on top of them. The next day we got clean sheets, but again had to put them on the bed ourselves. After this annoying first night, I resolved to just relax and let it go. Am glad I did as the rest of the trip stay there were no more problems. That is until we left. We had several children with us and as you can imagine, it was a bit loud getting everyone's things together and out the door. Well, a watch got left behind. It was noticed almost immediately that it was left so we called and were told to leave a voicemail with the lost and found department. I very explicitly described the watch, where it was left and that it could have possibly fallen behind the headboard or the desk. No once called us back after a couple of days so I called again and was told to leave another voicemail which I did. While we were there, the building we were in was fairly empty, so I assumed it may have taken a couple of days to clean the room. So I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. But again, so response, so I called again. Nothing. The fourth time I called, I tried to let the receptionist/phone operator know that I was tired of leaving voicemails as no one was calling me back, but was told that that was the only department I could deal with for a lost item. It's quite upsetting that I still haven't heard anything...not even a courtesy call to say they looked for the watch and couldn't find it. Was it possible I left it someplace else or something like that. But no contact from the at all. There was a lot of sentimental value for this watch and it\u2019s a bit disturbing that I couldn\u2019t even get a call back.

And I was not trying to get something for nothing...I paid $1295 for the week. The difference between TC and Villas is like night and day. The TC was built somewhere between 2006 - 2010 (depending on the building), wheras the Villas was built around the 1970's. I was told by WG reps that the company who sold me the VOA week for $1295 was found to have engaged in deceptive practices and was discharged by WG earlier this year. I also forgot to mention that I purchased this VOA week during a timeshare tour at the WG TC last year(2009).

I have stayed at several Westgate properties over the years. We traded through Interval International about two and a half weeks before our stay. The only rooms available in Orlando for our trade were all \"studio/hotel\" sized. Which meant NO full kitchen, washer/dryer, or separate living area. We were traveling with a 10,7, and 3 year old so we were concerned. However, when we checked in, we had a pleasant surprise! Our room was a one bedroom with a queen sized bed, a separate living room with a sleeper sofa, full sized fridge, and microwave, and a balcony! Much better than we expected. We also lucked out and got a first floor end unit which was great for the kids. We were in unit 5617B. The bathroom was granite and had a jetted tub that we never did get to use because it takes like an hour to fill up. Anyway there were paddle boats, bikes to rent, Disney movies in a mini theater (seats maybe 100 ppl), and activities every day. We loved the location as we usually stay off 192 anyway. Best Westgate yet. Oh, btw try to stay in the TOWN CENTER not the Villas because I think those seem to be older according to the reviews. Also friends of ours stayed at Westgate Lakes......(loved them as a kid/teen...as an adult...no way...they really need to update). We had a view of the lake and the giant water slide which the kids loved. Would book this one again!!. Pros: See above PLUS only asked about timeshare breakfast once Cons: Guard at entrance was rude, sugar ants got into the kitchen, no broom in suite although most floors were tile.( But I asked, and they brought one immediately).", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Charles", "Title": "\u201cI'm not a review writer normally, but please take time to hear me...\u201d", "Author": "CLBeckTAMU", "ReviewID": "UR70940318", "Content": "Normally I'm not one to throw my 2 cents in. But, I have to in this situation. For those of you (like me) that don't think reading any of these negative reviews would ever happen to me, please take all the negative reviews about this property into consideration. I'm so frustrated with this stay I'm still here on vacation writing this review. For those of you like me that work hard all year for a nice vacation with your family, you really can't afford for it to be a bad one, because you won't get another one until next year. This property has a very long check in experience. We were already tired from travelling, we really didn't want to wait in line for 1 hour then go thru a \"special\" tour as a cover-up time share marketing piece. Fortunately, we've learned the timeshare sales pitches by now and already own one and are happy with just one. The pictures of this property do look great, but it's like looking at a Big Mac picture, you really don't get what you see. Rooms are very small and cramped. Even took my empty suitcases out to the SUV to conserve space in the room. The room was very hot upon check-in. The AC really wasn't sufficient enough to catch up and cool it off until the next day. Leave it on the whole time if you want a cool room in mid-summer. The bathtub wouldn't drain and I had to get a maintenance man at 11pm out to unclog the tub. That can happen anywhere, but it just seemed like the straw that broke the camel's back to me. There were only 3 rags in the room for us (family of 4 staying for a week), so I requested about 8pm that those be brought to us by housekeeping. It's a mystery where they are located at so you have to request things be brought, you really can't just go to them. At 11pm when I requested the tub be unclogged, I also cancelled my request for the extra rags to be brought since we decided to just deal with it the next day. Maintenance guy was very nice and unclogged the tub about 11:15pm. At 1230am I'm awakened by a knock - housekeeping bringing me my extra rags. What a night, very frustrating. Then the real trouble starts the next day. At this point we've decided we are going to spend as much time away from the resort as possible because it's not really a resort, it's just a bad situation we want to stay away from and only sleep there because it's the roof over our head for the week. A new party is checking in next door. A girls basketball team playing in a regionals tournament i believe. They are mid-teens. This property has a common exterior door leading into a common area with an A-unit and a B-unit. It's really too close for comfort. I know that I'm in Orlando and it's not the mountains where you can have peace and quiet. But, being the team player that I am, I'm not the type to complain until it gets ridiculous. After 12 am I politiley knocked on their door, and the adults in the room were very rude and irresponsible. I could smell alcohol, which really concerned me for those teenage girls, I even saw 2 men come and leave at one point very late at night.. I immediately lost the being on vacation feeling and back to the real world feeling. I complained to security and front desk of the noise, door being left open and music playing loudly. Front desk is no help at all, security is very nice and tries to do their job, but really, what can they do?? It finally went quiet about 3 am every night. We are leaving 2 days early to have a nice weekend back at home before work starts back. There is nothing special about this place, please stay away for your family's sake. If I've discouraged one family from coming here, I've done my job. The management at this property really only has two concerns - keeping it booked up and timeshares being sold.

It lacks the flat screen tvs, tub/shower combo in guest bathroom and granite counter tops. On a positive note, it is in walking distance to most of the onsite activities. Dining: There is no more breakfast in the main building (even though it is advertised on westgate channel in the room), but on some days, a continental breakfast is offered for owners. The onsite food places are average. Therefore, I recommend renting a car if it is in the budget. Also, please beware of local restaurants that offer the very cheap rates for breakfast. All I can say is that you get what you pay for. OnSite Activities: There are paddle boats, bicycles, putt putt golf and a train. Unfortunately, all of these close rather early (about 6pm), considering it is still daylight until almost 8pm. According to the brochure given at check-in, the train stops at 3pm. The main problem with the train is locating it. Yes, there are train stops located throughout the resort, but no times are listed. I witnessed guests just flagging it down and getting on. Figured I would try it as well (whenever I saw it) and it worked fine. It was refreshing to ride around the resort to get an overview of all that is offered. Also, drinks served at pool 1 and 13 were pretty good. The games and music during smash burger days were entertaining to say the least. Internet: Wireless is available but at a cost -approximately $50 for guests and $25 for owners. The cost would not have been nearly as bad if the internet was not running at toad speed.
