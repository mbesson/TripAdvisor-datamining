It is a pretty run-down hotel, for the high price. I've been in Motel 6s and Holiday Inn Express hotels that have been in MUCH better condition than this Marriott! I've been pretty acceptable of bad hotels over the years, hardly ever complained. But this Marriott has a history of bad service and poor quality rooms among our traveling group of TV crew members. I have already changed my room on this current stay because of a strange unknown white stain splattered on the carpet in the first room I was assigned (Room 918). Unfortunately I was too tired to change rooms at the time as I had already unpacked and got situated before I noticed the stain. Fortunately, I wear house slippers in the hotel room wherever I go, and I avoided that area of the room. I told the front desk manager about the stain the next morning and he said they would try to clean it up. I got back from work that day to find the stain still there and my house slippers placed on the sink (the same slippers in which I had been walking around in the hotel room). I also noticed that the tub did not drain when the shower was on even though it drained perfectly fine the night before and that very morning. I called down for a manager and was told that he had just stepped away and would be back in 20 minutes. I asked for him to call me as soon as he got back. I waited a half hour with no call from the manager. I called back down and asked for the manager and they again said he would be back in 20 minutes. I told the clerk that the room was horrible, housekeeping is non-existent and I wanted to change rooms. She put me on hold and no more than 30 seconds went by and I got a manager on the phone. He looked at the room's incident history and changed my room to a junior suite...but not before I examined the room for any evidence of DNA samples and checked the tub and shower for proper drainage! On this hotel's behalf, they did offer an amenity of a small bottle of wine, some pretzels and a bowl of fruit, but I'd rather they save their money on amenities and just hire a housekeeping staff that actually does their jobs, or start renovating the rooms! Besides, by offering an amenity and not cleaning the stain it just shows that they would prefer to buy a customer's good graces than actually work for it. (I did not partake in the amenities, choosing instead to place it outside my door). Another incident occurred on this same trip. My co-worker was checking email this morning in his room with the do-not-disturb sign clearly hanging outside on the doorknob. He heard someone put a key in the slot, the door unlock and he saw the door open. Fortunately he had the latch on the door so it stopped, then slowly closed. He immediately opened the door and looked outside and saw that no one there. However, the housekeeping cart was next door! No one knocked or announced the typical \"housekeeping!\" DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF", "Title": "\u201cThis is one of the most beat up Marriott's I have ever stayed in.\u201d", "Author": "SFjoe", "ReviewID": "UR128344063", "Content": "I am currently suffering here at this property due to a convention I am attending and without paying highway robbery prices to switch hotels (they are all packed) I will have to stay for another 4 nights. This Marriott looks like something out of the 60's and while centrally located in downtown LA there is not much more I can say about choosing this hotel unless the only other option is the soup kitchen down the street. Pros: Location and very friendly staff. Great attitude and I feel for them working in such a run down hotel. This hotel is going through rennovation and the rooms are in desperate need that is for sure. Maybe check back in a year. Food was decent in the cafe downstairs in the lobby. Flat screens in the rooms. Jr suite good size room with separate living room. The pool area is nice but small. The freeway is behind the pool area and there is some constant noise but that is to be expected. Cons: The lobby smells of cheap soap. Not sure what is going on here but it smells like bathroom soap and very strong. The lobby has been refurbished so it looks pretty decent. Free internet which is nice in the lobby. Rooms are frankly horrible. looks like some grandmother's self furnished retirement home quarters. Right out of the 60's with green pink carpet and beat up furniture. We are in a Jr Suite which is a good size but the furniture is so uncomfortable that you really do not want to use it for any length of time. The beds are miserable just miserable and I put that fact down to our room has not been refurbished. (God i hope so because if our room was redone...then yikes) Everytime my spose or I moved while sleeping the mattress moved with us. I felt like I was on a ship which was rocking and rolling all night. The quality of the mattress is one of the worst I have ever experienced. I don't expect much sleep over the next four days. Room is dark and depressing. The club room is a nice place to work on your computer and the food is decent however they have three flat screens in the room and this morning (Sunday) at 6:45am) all three TV's were blasting away and so loud we chose instead to go downstairs to pay for our breakfast than eat in the cub room. Who is watching sports at 6:45am on a Sunday morning? I would not recommend staying here until they have finished their remodeling job. If one cannot sleep then the hotel has not real value especially when traveing on business.

Next morning on the way out again asked for a blanket we're told that we would get one also told reception about bedroom doors sqeaking in room was told this would be fixed came back that day no blanket and still queaky doors. Next morning went for shower no shampoo replacement, wet I searched through suitcase and found some.

TV had free cable and that was good but was puzzled that a hotel of this size had the 'old' type of tv and not a lcd flat screen. The restaurants are acceptable but expensive but the wait staff are very friendly and helpful. Some of the staff at check in were fantastic while others seemed to be bothered that you asked for help and were not very knowledgable at all. My one major concern was that in our month in the USA we stayed in about 15 different hotels and although this rated highly in terms of cleanliness and comfort it was the ONLY hotel that charged for wifi acess!! All in all, the hotel is a pretty good standard but my tip is not to allow them to take an imprint of your credit card because a couple of our tour group had charges against their accounts even although nothing had been used. It took a lot of sorting out to rectify as well!!", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOK - just feels / smells like a Courtyard?\u201d", "Author": "SpringT", "ReviewID": "UR113768415", "Content": "The location is really quite convenient if you have business in the Financial District, or a conference at the Convention Center.

Plenty to choose from with an omelet station, fruits, pancakes, waffles, french toast, of course the usual pork meats, smoked salmon, and tasty slow cooked oatmeal, etc. They were able to accommodate my milk intolerance by bringing me soy milk which I was impressed with.

On first arrival everything seemed great, warm receptive employees, beautiful d\u00e9cor, clean atmosphere, everything I look for when checking into a new property. The check in process went rather fast, considering there was not much traffic in the lobby when we arrived. The hotel room was average, nothing to complain about. As me and my friends got settled in the room we realized how hungry we were from the long trip. We called room service to hope to fulfill our hunger, but instead had another coming. At 11 p.m. on a Saturday night all room service had to offer us was a cold cut turkey sandwich. Not being in vegas we could not travel anywhere that was 24 hours , so we decided to try the sandwich out. The mistake that we made was assuming that the $24.00 turkey sandwich would be enough for 2 of us to split, that was wrong. This average sandwich did nothing to our appetite except frustrate it. The next day when it came time to check out is where I had the real issue with the Marriott property. After checking out, I walked to valet to get my car, and that is where I was told that I owed $30 for my overnight valet service. I was shocked by this amount considering my car was only parked overnight, and most of all I was never told it cost anything to valet at Marriott. I then asked for the manager of valet, and asked him how are people are suppose to assume these costs. He replied by pointing at a small sign posted at the valet podium. I then told him that with so much traffic in the valet, the podium should be in a more visible spot, that way people are aware of the costs of valet, and have a chance to make a decision according to the cost. The manager then responded by saying \u201cwhen you become a manager, you can make that decision, do you want your car or not?\u201d I then followed by paying my $30 fee, and telling him that what could have been a descent experience, he had put a negative stamp on it. Hoping the manager would stop me on my way to my car and make a last attempt to right things, I slowly got in my car and left. Instead I got nothing more than a friendly wave from the valet podium.

It was 10PM and I kindly asked him to wait a minute while we decide what we are doing with our vehicles. I had learned from other tripadvisor members that there is parking directly across the street in the World Trade Center. So one of us ran across and spoke with a parking garage employee and he confirmed that you can park overnight for $10. The garage is well light and secure. So we headed across the street and spent $10 each instead of $30 at the Marriott. Ha! When we approached the check in counter we were greeted by the robotic front desk manager. He was very matter of fact and had little personality. He informed me that he didn't have any king beds as requested because the hotel was near capacity, which seemed odd since we were one of the only few people in the hotel lobby area, which is very large, impressive, but smelled liked old fashioned air freshener. It was terrible. As a platinum member I am guaranteed my room type. He stated that he had king beds on a lower floor. I said that would be fine. We then found out that he issued me a king bed on the 5th floor and my other 3 colleagues 2 doubles on the 5th floor. They were too tired to complain. My room was spacious but I felt like I walked into a room that was decorated circa 1992. I was dumbfounded. I only stay in Marriott properties and I have not seen anything like this in years. The carpet was hunter green with pink designs and worn. I kept my flip flops on. The lamps that flanked the bed were pink with cheap dirty off-white shades. The tv was old-fashioned tube tv and small. It looked silly on the armoire. The drapes were just as old and unattractive. It felt plain awful and so did the mushy bed. I did not feel or look like a typical Marriott Jameson bed. I must say the bathroom was upgraded with marble-looking counters and floors and lots of lighting and mirrors.

The Room The bed was great, so soft and lots of pillows, just what myself and my partner needed after a long flight. The decor of the room was a bit dated and boring. Lighting I found this a bit strange. When I entered the room there was a switch on the wall which turned on a light bulb over the door/entry area which is fine. What was strange is that there were no lights in the ceiling over the main room area including the bed. Instead there were 4 or 5 lamps around the room which I had to turn on individually. Even just one bulb in the middle of the ceiling with a switch at the door would have so much more convenient. Food The food and drinks were over priced and there are plenty of nearby good quality restaurants serving great food at the right price. I did not have any food or drink from the hotel. Pool I think I would give the pool a good complement. It was a nice area to chill out, enjoy the weather and go for a swim. The pool is a bit small in comparison to other hotels I have stayed at and you know your in the middle of the city. Would I stay here again? Probably not. LA has such a great transport infrastructure that its easy to get in and out of downtown in minutes. A day pass on the metro is $3 which also allows you to use the bus if necessary.

Great hotel and room for the price. However, and this is a big however, if you are on business and rent a car, then the ONLY option for conveniently parking is the valet which is $30 a day, making it among the biggest hotel rip-offs in the country. But as another reviewer has reported, much cheaper parking is available if you hunt for it (hint-- the hotel staff will NOT help you find this parking, or even admit it exists...the concierge and desk help will tell you that the parking price is \"competitive\" and even \"low for downtown LA\"). I could not do such hunting because of my limited time away from my conference, and because there was almost always bumper to bumper street traffic, and because it was raining all weekend. Further, every time you drop off your car, or ask for it to be brought to the front of the hotel, you must tip the driver. $2 is the absolute bare minimum for this kind of service, and so if you need to come and go about five times during the day, this is another $20 daily added to the parking thing. And these valets are very serious. There is a whole army of them, and then there is a supervisor who actually manages the order in which the valets are assigned to cars, and interacts directly with the hotel guests, and expects his own tip. Internet service is $10 a day, no free router in the lobby either, so if you are even remotely interested in getting anything done, you must pay up. A martini at the bar, not name brand but a well drink, is $10 before tip, and don't even try to make it up by eating through several tumblers of bar snack mix, your stomach can't take it. So, bottom line, when do you find yourself stressing about all these add-ons? When you are sitting in your very comfortable and clean hotel room, with fluffy pillows and turndown service, watching a \"free\" premium channel while perusing the room service breakfast menu that you can't afford anyway. The NBA championship had just started at the Staples Center and so many guests were people with large disposable incomes, who seemed to command the greatest attention from staff. On the plus side, the view from my room was exquisite and made me feel right at the heart of downtown. So I would suggest this hotel only if you have the money to relax there and be taken care of, but if not, then beware of selecting any of Hotwire's unnamed four-star hotels in downtown LA for $60-65 because it's a trap--the hotel will get your money anyway...", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cgreat location & price & save the $30 on parking~\u201d", "Author": "NyTraveler321", "ReviewID": "UR32422484", "Content": "got 2 rooms at this hotel from priceline.com for $60/night. the room was great with comfy beds and pillows. bathroom was fill with bath & body works stuff. one of the rooms had a separate bath and shower. we were on the 5th floor so we didnt get much of a view except for the freeway. we rented a car for travel in LA and yes the valet parking at the hotel was $30 a night and it was operated outside of the hotel. but there's actually ALOT of parking garages around the neighborhood for much cheaper. alot of meter parking after 11PM around the block. couple of nights, there were free meter parking right outside the hotel. we parked at an parking lot on 8th st (4 blocks down) for $6 flat rate all night. we only used the hotel for sleeping so this didnt bother us.otherwise parking is very expensive in LA. $4 meters/hr! location of hotel was nice on the week days, during the weekend it was really deserted. also very conveniently located 2 blocks away from the major freeways. went to most of the attractions nearby in under 30 mins.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cVery safe and clean.\u201d", "Author": "blr5004", "ReviewID": "UR31396367", "Content": "My friends and I went here during the Rose Bowl.

Live. We were looking for an inexpensive, convenient and CLEAN hotel in downtown L.A. for our stay. The Marriott was inexpensive compared to other downtown L.A. hotels, and it was convenient enough (walking distance) from the places we planned to see in downtown L.A. The positives: The hotel is clean. There were never any dirty towels or bedding. The staff was very nice, professional and helpful. It also felt safe. Our room was clean; it was a nice size and had floor to ceiling windows with a nice view of Figueroa Street and downtown L.A. from the 7th floor. The beds were comfortable as well. The negatives: This place could REALLY use some updating. The TVs are very outdated. They don't even have basic video/audio inputs. The furniture looks like it is from the 1980s. The carpet is outdated as well. It has to be at least 10 - 15 years old. All the light fixtures are outdated as well. Also, the lock on our door had several loose screws that I actually tightened myself with a pair of scissors. One thing that really bothered me was the lack of free Internet access in the business center. The hotel charges $10 for 20 minutes of Internet access. Neither of has had laptops so we ended up spending $30 on Internet access. Another issue was the refrigerator in our room. It did not work, so the hotel placed a note inside it stating that we could \u201crent\u201d a portable one for a daily fee. Also, the elevators were often slow due to maintenance, and we had to take the service elevators often. The hotel only has one restaurant, which we did not try. However, the Westin is a block away and has more restaurants. There are also other places to eat in walking distance. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay, but I really think that it is on its last legs. A new Marriott is being built in the L.A.

However, when looking downtown LA, there's really not too many that are better for the business traveler. As with other hotels downtown, the busyness of this hotel ebbs and flows when there are conventions in town or when the foreign bus tours are in town. When that happens, it seems to slow everything down dramatically. Waiting for an elevator between 8am-9am can be painful even if you are on a high floor as you'll stop at every floor and the elevator will likely be crowded with tourists with huge suitcases. If you're on a low floor, good luck with the stairs or the maintenance elevators. Over the months I was there (May- Oct) the issues with the elevators were always apparent whenever the hotel was near capacity. All in all that's only a minor setback, but can grow to be a major annoyance if you stay here for a while. There really aren't too many options downtown for the average business traveler, but this hotel offers all of the standard amenities you'd expect for in a Marriott.

For Platinum members, their upgrade policy is very generous. Each time we have been there, we have been upgraded to a great suite. One of the times was a junior suite of sorts - which was an enormous room with a bilevel sleeping/living area with nonstop views out the window. This last time, we spent the week in the Vista Suite on the 5th floor (room 501) and it was an outstanding room with floor to ceiling windows on 3/4 walls, huge living room with dining area, a lot of space, a large bedroom with a really comfortable bed, and terrific room service for morning coffee. They were speedy, too. Also - their front desk service is phenomenal. Though we were originally booked for a certain number of days, when we called to change, it was all taken care of without any problems at all, no matter that they were booking a Vista Suite for the standard room price or anything. They accomodated us in every way. I should note, though, that for such a high-class room, their TVs really need some upgrading. They had 24\" tubes... and while this is just a minor details, it's details like this that prevent this hotel from getting 5 stars. Their hotel lobby is large - sprawling, actually, and while the layout is a bit weird (you have to go all the way to one corner to go up to your room), the lobby is always bustling with activity and makes for a good location for people to come and visit you, if you don't intend to head out to eat or drink. There always seems to be something going on, be it a party or convention, upstairs on the 2nd floor. Valet service was fast and efficient, and location is central to wherever you need to go in LA. It's right around the corner from the 110 freeway, and only minutes to K-town, 15 minutes to Beverly Hills (if LA had no traffic, which I should add, never happens), and merely 25 minutes to LAX - by distance, anyhow. I would not hesitate to stay here time and again - and would highly recommend anyone who plans to stay in LA to consider this particular Marriott.

(Mind you, this is supposed to be a 4-star, world-famous hotel chain with a rack rate of US$169 and up + tax per night !) 3. Everything in the room looks dated because they are very old.

Their pillows must be the smallest pillows available in the hotel industry! 4. The TV is at least 15 years old!

We paid $143 a night on the weekend and thought it was very reasonable in comparison to other hotels in the area. The bathroom was really impressive and nice for a Marriott! We really enjoyed our stay here!", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geelong", "Title": "\u201cLoved it for one night stay\u201d", "Author": "maryr1", "ReviewID": "UR7668940", "Content": "I stayed here for one night before beginning a tour. It was an absolute joy. Desk staff were more than helpful with suggesting dining and shopping options, the store in the foyer was well stocked, restraurants looked busy and the hotel felt classy and homey. I had a room on the 9th floor that looked over the freeway, pool and city, and found that was quite pleasant to look at surprisingly. The room had floor to ceiling windows, a very comfortable king bed, fantastic bathroom and fluffly robes. I stayed in watching TV in bed and fell asleep very comfortable and happy. Check out was easy, quick and friendly - would stay there again on return to LA very happily.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLA is just one big freeway...\u201d", "Author": "FrequentFrier", "ReviewID": "UR7402173", "Content": "The Harbor Freeway goes right by this hotel - and if you have an odd-numbered room you will hear it, all night.

Otherwise, the hotel is clean and the staff seemed efficient. I ate elsewhere, so cannot comment on the food etc. There were some panhandlers in surrounding streets, but also plenty of cops on bikes and in cars.
