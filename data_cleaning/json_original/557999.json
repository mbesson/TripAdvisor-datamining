{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Value, Not Near Train Stations This place has GOOD, OK  Ugly qualities. The place does not have a slum feel about it at all unlike some of the cheaper accommodations in Hong Kong! So let's begin with the Good, OK and finish with the ugly :-)GOOD - The rooms were cleaned everyday. Receptionists are friendly, smiley, helpful, speaks english  knowledgeable about their local surroundings ie. where to catch the bus, what route to walk, where is the trains etc. Breakfast was good! It's not buffet style, they provide a set a-la-carte menu that you can choose from. The food in the Chinese  Noodle style breakfast that is available is fantastic - its better than or equivalent to some of the best foods I've tasted in dim sim restaurants in Australia. OK - bathrooms are very very small, you need to be able to function in tiny areas. The green walls and low ceilings give it a not-so clean feel (they are cleaned everyday with the provision of fresh towels). Ugly - get ready those walking shoes! The nearest MTR station (Prince Edward MTR) is about a good 20+mins walk (reasonable pace) away. You can stop along the shops to make the walk more pleasant! The nearest KCR/ subway (Mongkok East KCR) is about a 10mins walk. Highly recommend that you take the longer walk to the MTR as its easier to change lines for train transfers. The KCR - train changes required; more complicated, time taken will be worst than the long walk to the MTR.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR208272904", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Thong_Joy"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d557999-r20797925-Caritas_Lodge-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "557999", "Price": " first\" id=\"hotel_557999\">"}}
