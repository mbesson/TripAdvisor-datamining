It's just a short walk to the nearest tram stop and you're only a few minutes away from Alexanderplatz by tram. The staff were really welcoming and I think that most of them spoke English, although as a German-language class this wouldn't have presented a barrier for us anyway! There was a small bar in the lobby but we chose to go out in the evenings and we were spoilt for choice! Restaurants litter the mainstreet and the public transport runs late if you want to venture further afield. The rooms were basic with about four beds each - but they were exactly right for us and for a youth hostel the quality was very good! Our stay could have been spoiled by some fussy neighbours but the staff very quickly diffused the situation by reminding them that this is a youth hostel so some noise from the young guests is to be expected! That may be the downside to this hostel - it's not for a relaxing spa experience. It's a rough-and-ready but very welcoming basecamp for people who will spend more time in the city than in their rooms. The only other thing is that it's quite tucked-away and could be difficult to find without local knowledge - but the locals are very nice and willing to help, so there shouldn't be any bother at all!", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ramsbottom, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGroup trip\u201d", "Author": "Dibbley", "ReviewID": "UR126009148", "Content": "Stayed here on my sons Stag do, the staff were very accommodating, the rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, the bathroom again clean, the shower is quite powerful, but the temperature can vary, quite dangerously on occasion, very hot!

We chose this place because it was still pretty cheap and close to all places we needed in Prenzl' Berg so location was the most important. It happened to be ok but if you need to walk around the city and travel in different areas of the city I'd recommend to choose something close to the metro. I didn't enjoy using the metro (U-Bahn) and the the tram line too. The problem in't connection - it's easy to find tram stops at Alexander Platz but you have to wait everywhere 10 minutes to change so it takes pretty much time at the end. The ckeck in was quick, we had to wait for the accomodation though as the rooms were not ready but reception stuff tried to give us rooms as soon as possible and we got them around 12 instead of 14. It was nice. Then we decided to sleep 2-3 hours as we had a very early flight and were very tired but it was totally impossible. Cleaners were cleaning till 15 or 16 and it was sooo noisy that it was not possible to fall asleep even though we nornally never had sleeping problems. The walls of the rooms are made of cartoon or something. When my friend dried her hair with the hair dryer (we had our own one) in the next room we could hear it as if she was doing it in our bathroom. Then we (a couple in a double room) realized we were given a big room with 4 separate beds two of which were just moved together, so it was not comfortable to sleep together. I asked at the reception for another room with a double bed as we booked such a room (I even wrote a comment on this while booking) but they told me the second room where my friend stayed was with a double bed and they couldn't change anything now. I asked why they accomodate us like that and got the answer that they thought it would be nicer for two people having bigger room and offered me to exchange rooms with my friend. When I told that we've already slept in beds and put our things around they told to change bed cheets as they were all the same size:) It's not too bad I think so we did change rooms with changing bed sheets but I still think hotel has either to follow the booking details or improve things if there is a mistake instead of putting troubles on guests. Breakfast was very basic as it's written here so this is what was expected. I am vegetarian so it was almost nothing to eat apart from muesli and jams. Other people didn't complain. The benefit is that breakfast lasts till 12! The shower is a funny issue. It was perfect the first day because we woke up too late and there was hot water. The second day there was no hot water before moving out. I guess everybody was showering before moving out on Sunday around 11-11:30 so cold shower was not very nice. I guess there is no fault of the stuff, it's just the system has limits of hot water produced. My friend wated a bit and got hot water back in 15 minutes. The rooms are clean, very basic, without TV-set, no hair drier, no fridge, no conditioner etc. It was also expected though. The disappointment was Internet connection which is supposed to work in \"common areas\", my boyfriend needed to go to Internet cafe as WiFi at the reception didn't work and they told it might have been trouble with his laptop (he dozens of times got connected to WiFi in hotels and there was no problem). All in all I expected a cheap more hostel like place but it was disappointing still. So I would recommend it for young people in groups (4-6 people travel on small budget) and only for 2-3 days.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat hostel - Would definitely return\u201d", "Author": "pinkmojo2004", "ReviewID": "UR27869402", "Content": "I stayed here with a friend last year for 1 night. The hostel is housed in a former factory and is situated away from the road in a courtyard - even so, we had no problems finding it. It is also easy to get to from Schoenefeld Airport by train and tram. It was nearly 11pm when we arrived but the area felt safe and we had no problems checking in. The rooms are basic but clean and bright. The push-button shower may take some getting used to though! There is a cinema and pool hall under the hostel, but there was no noise coming from there when we stayed. There are several restaurants and takeaways nearby and we got some Chinese food to eat out from a place that was just closing. They packed it into boxes for us, gave us forks and serviettes and even opened our bottles of beer. We ate it at the tables and chairs outside the cinema under the hostel. Staff were friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfast at the hostel was lovely. There was no warm food, but ample bread, bread rolls, sliced meats and cheeses, muesli, cereal, yogurt, tea, coffee and juice etc to keep us going until the afternoon. It's quite a walk to Friedrichstr, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag etc. It took us about half an hour, but we wanted to look round. There's a tram stop at the end of the street if you prefer.

We are both in our 30s and were looking for well-priced Berlin accommodations, particularly given that the dollar's collapse has made most of Europe very expensive for Americans. We emailed the hotel and were permitted to check in at 11AM to a vacant room, which I thought was very accommodating of the hotel staff. The location of the hotel is very good, although a tram is required to access the U- and S-Bahns at Alexanderplatz. Trams seem to run every few minutes so access to the rest of the city is extremely easy. Prenzlauer Berg is becoming a sort of Williamsburg/Park Slope- very attractive older buildings, rapidly being gentrified, with an excellent selection of eating and bars within walking distance of the hotel. The problem came from the position of the Transit Loft's rooms in relation to the rest of the hotel. The hotel lobby resembles a cafe, with much seating and hang out space. It is very user-friendly, but attracts a lot of traffic. This still wouldn't have been a problem, except that the Transit Loft attracts large numbers of students and/or 20-somethings on group visits and tours to Berlin. It is clearly on the itinerary of travel agencies, and we could see why. The hordes of group visitors meant that the hotel lobby was occupied until very late in the evening (actually early in the morning) by people hanging out. Not far down the hall, separated from the noise and smoke only by a door, we found it insufferable. Upon moving upstairs in the morning (again, the staff were very gracious about this and transferred us to an excellent room), we found more students sitting in the hallways at all hours of the day (and night), typing away on their laptops. Why they couldn't use their rooms I don't know, but we thought it was bizarre. In any event, the lobby noise was gone! The rooms were very clean and staff refreshed them daily. The private bathroom was comfortable and attractive. But the presence of 4 single beds in the room made it again clear that the Transit Loft is mostly designed for groups of students. This is an excellent option for people travelling in groups of 3 to 8, either independently in a group, who don't mind noise and are interested in socializing with like-minded travelers in their early 20s. In this sense, despite its higher prices, the Transit Loft functions like a true hostel. But I would advise other travelers to approach with caution, particularly during the busy summer season.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place To Stay in Eastern Center\u201d", "Author": "Tamminga", "ReviewID": "UR14949249", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Transit Loft for 3 nights in March 2008.

I didn't get that feeling. I'd recommend the hotel if traveling with a group, or if you can get a single/double room at less than 50 EUR. Otherwise you should be able to find a much nicer place elsewhere in a more quaint location for a similar price. LOCATION The hotel's street address is Griefswalder Strasse, a fairly busy street in the Alexanderplatz area of Berlin. But the actual hotel is set back from this road. It is one building behind the actual building that is located on this street. There is a lot of construction in this area. There are restaurants, bars, and clubs nearby, but it can get a little bit noisy at night. This part of Berlin won't make for a quaint stroll. It feels safe, but many of the buildings are littered with graffiti and the construction made it hard to feel an attachment to the area. TRANSPORTATION & PARKING The hotel is located close to the Alexzanderplatz area, though walking to Alexzanderplatz from the hotel probably would take at least 30 minutes. We drove to the hotel and found it pretty easy to find, since Griefswalder Strasse is a fairly main road. There is free street parking on Immanuelstrasse next to the hotel. But the hotel also has a free underground parking deck right next to the hotel that was very convenient. There are a couple of train/subway stops within walking distance of the hotel. We used the Griefswalder S-Bahn stop. It is a good 15-20 minute walk north from the hotel on Griefswalder Strasse. You'll find ticket machines there that accept cash or credit. They also have many different language options. We bought a 24 hour ticket for all the Berlin districts. It cost around six euros. Do buy a ticket on the Berlin subways; they tend to check for tickets on trains more than other major European cities. There also is a tram line that runs down Griefswalder Strasse, so you can hop on the tram outside the hotel and take it north to the S-Bahn stop. SERVICE The hotel's main lobby is located on the third floor of an office-type building. It has rooms on both the third and fourth floors. Other companies occupy the building as well. Check-in and check-out was quick and efficient. ROOMS The rooms have a hostel feel to them, but they are spacious. There was no tv and no air conditioning. Beds were very basic and fairly comfortable. Overall the room didn't have a warm feeling to it. With no AC, you'll have to open the windows in the summer. There are some clubs and even a casino close by, so noise can be an issue. Fortunately we didn't have a problem sleeping. The bathroom was a pretty good size, though the shower was very small. BREAKFAST The free breakfast was a typical US continental breakfast: rolls, cheese, cereal. No juice was provided so plan to drink coffee, water, or milk. There was a large seating area where you can socialize with other guests. INTERNET ACCESS The hotel has a PC in the lobby where you can use the internet. There is no in-room internet access provided. SUMMARY We paid 69 euros for a double room during the weekend of the Berlin marathon in September 2006. Perhaps that event raised the price, but we would never stay there again at that rate. You should be able to find something else in the 70-80 euros range that provides much better facilities.
