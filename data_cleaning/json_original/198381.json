{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Budget hotel with an amazing location Stayed here four nights. If you want a room in florence in August under $100 (yes dollars) with an amazing location, this is the place. Having said that, I was by far the oldest tenant and I never stopped hearing from my significant other Now will you spend a little more?!? This place is an amazing deal, but I think I am at the point in my life that since I can afford it, I should probably upgrade my hotel choices.  The train station (Firenze S.M.N.) is 200 meteres walk. The Duomo is 200 meters in the other direction. You can walk to EVERYTHING, from the Ponte Vechio to the Accademia to the train station.  Now, the hotel, as others have stated there is no elevator, most economy hotels in europe dont have them. The rooms are small, but people, people, people, its EUROPE, the rooms are ALL small. The star ratings have less to do with the size of the room and more to do with the amenities offered.  There is no AC, it was brutal, if you open the windows you get eaten by mosquitos. The owner got us a fan (I loved her for this)and we bought a mosquito killer for $5 at the store and we were fine after the first night. The rooms are sparse and only semi clean. The bathroom was hysterical, very narrow, shower was integrated, as they can be in Europe, so everything gets wet when you shower. The towels were not really towels but large gauzy dish towel like things. We just called them table cloths.  The breakfast was light european, bread, cereal, coffee, juice.You have to leave your keys at the front desk but there is always someone there at night. If I was a 20 something again, I would stay here in a heartbeat. As a 40 something, I am not so adventurous and need just a bit more than this place offers, but not much. I can say nothing bad about the Romagna, I got what I paid for.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR487238982", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PHXTrainer"}, {"Content": "Do not insult yourself!

It is very near the Duomo and the night life but it is very very basic. There are no guests allowed so if you are single just book for yourself as you will not be able to bring company back. The reception is supposed to be open 24hours but after 8pm a night porter comes on and sleeps behind the reception. On the second night of my stay I was told If i wanted to enter the building as late as 4am i had to inform reception in advance. Needless to say this and the manner in which the information was delivered to me did not make this an at all appealing place to stop over. Reasonable as the rates are and as nice as the two girls on reception could be, the hotel is nothing more than an upmarked hostel and is not inclined toward consistent standards.

We stayed here for 7 nights which was definitely too long. The location of the hotel was perfect and we did want a budget hotel in the centre of the city, but having stayed here, I 'd rather pay extra for a little more comfort and services. The room was TINY and the bathroom was cramped, I ended up using the public toilet as that was much bigger and cooler! There was a safe, but it was a key safe and as we had to hand our room key to reception every morning, it seemed a little pointless. We were badly bitten by mosquitoes as we left the window open at night due to no air-conditioning, so, although we then armed ourselves with repellent and plugs, we still spent the rest of the holiday itching and bitten! The staff were friendly, but the breakfast was disappointing, a hard bread roll, there was a free coffee machine, which was the only good point about the breakfast, but unfortunately this broke down after 2 days! I think the worst thing about this hotel was that alterations were being carried out during our stay and our doors had been replaced with new ones when we came back one afternoon, and I was upset to find dust all over my belongings!! This happened the next day also when the new frame was then added to the door! Why they couldn't have done this during the low season, I'll never know!", "Date": "Aug 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR185649477", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kitty2007"}, {"Content": "Great hotel We stayed at Hotel Romagna for five nights in beautiful Florence in August.

We were on the 6th (top) floor and there is no lift, so unless you are reasonably fit you will struggle to climb (and carry your luggage!) above the 3rd or 4th floor. It was manageable for a few days though. There was no aircon in our room and as a result we got a couple of mosquito bites after keeping the window open all night. Having said that it was generally very clean and the receptionists spoke excellent English and were very friendly and helpful. The location was EXCELLENT. We were less than 2 minutes from the Cathedral and had a gorgeous view of the Medici Chapel from our bedroom. Very close to all the shops/ restaurants/ gelaterias you could hope for too.

The hotel provides basic, clean comfortable beds in the heart of the historic district. Short walks to the major attractions. The bathrooms were incredibly small, difficult to navigate with poor water pressure. Be prepared to climb many steep stairs, because all the rooms begin on the 2nd floor. Ask for a room in the back because the street noise is incredibly loud all night. No irons in room (which was stated on one web site), hairdryers available at the front desk. The service and staff were wonderful - we changed rooms after climbing 5 flights of stairs for a day and not sleeping the first night because of the street noise.

The first thing to say about this hotel is that there is no air conditioning. We stayed in Florence in July in the middle of a heatwave (32-36 degrees), and even just lying down on the bed the sweat was literally dripping off us. It was worse when you had a shower, because the room just got hotter - we even began to wonder why we were bothering to get showered at all at one point! When we walked outside in the morning to go sightseeing the cooler air outside was such a relief. We had to leave the window open at night and sleep on top of the bed with no clothes on. Our room faced the back of the hotel, and it seemed as if it was a delivery entrance as around 7am it started to get quite noisy. This didn't bother us too much at first but it became annoying after a couple of days.The second thing to say is that there is no lift. Our room was on the 3rd floor, and it is rather a narrow, steep staircase you have to climb to get your bags up there. We are both fit and healthy people, but we were seriously out of breath by the time we got to our room!If you want to be picky, the other things we would say are that there was damp in our room which could be clearly seen on the ceiling and in the bathroom. But we're not too bothered about things like that generally, but some people are so it's only fair to mention it. Same with the towels, they were the thin ones, but to be honest, considering the heat, a thick towel would have been worse. The thin towels aren't bad anyway, but if you are looking for luxury then you would be disappointed with them.The breakfast we had was a bit poor compared to the other hotels we stayed at. It consisted of 1 small bread roll each and jams and things, and 1 packet each of that dried toast stuff. There was also cereal which you could help yourself to which was good, and plenty of juice in jugs and coffee from a machine. The milk was warm, but I think it is everywhere in Itlay! One of the breakfast rooms was actually air conditioned which was nice, but you cooled down only to sweat again later after climbing up the staircase to the sauna that is your room.We stayed here for three nights, which was enough. The location is superb, as it is literally down the road from the Duomo. It is such a shame actually, as this hotel could be such a gem if only it had better facilities. On our 4th night we moved to Hotel Golf, which is by the train station. This was a welcome relief in terms of coolness, but it was much further away from the lively centre. My advice: find somewhere in this area, but not this hotel unless you go at a cooler time of year.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR646937003", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "2citybreakers"}, {"Content": "shabby The Romagna is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.
