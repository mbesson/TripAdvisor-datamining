The apartment came with a good size bedroom, large bathroom and a small kitchen with a breakfast bar, tv and single sofa. Breakfast was good, lots of choices. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We went at Easter and they hung an easter treats bag on everyone's door - nice touch.

The main reason, she said, is it being located in the middle of town (mitte) currently the most \"in\" because of the vicinity of the main museums, shopping centers, distractions a.s.o. We were not exactly suited because we are more inclined with what is called \"serious\" events, opera, concerts etc and these are far away, in the western side. The room was very functional, seemingly suitable for business people coming for a short stay. However they were many pairs obviously coming for pleasure and even pairs with children.

Great budget hotel - functional and modern. It's no frills in a truly modern way. The rooms aren't big but why would you need anything larger on a 3 night city break? The shower was excellent (always a deciding factor with hotels for me!!) and everything required for a comfortable stay was supplied. The room was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed.The staff were all very pleasant and helpful and when we asked for extra pillows they arrived very promptly. Breakfasts were excellent with plenty of choice and the dining room was stylish and pleasant. The location of the hotel was ideal for us as museum island is only a pleasant 15 minute walk away and Hoffe is a 10 minute stroll with a great choice of eating places. Would suggest taking an Insider Walking Tour as a start to a Berlin break (starts a 10 minute stroll from the hotel). It's 4 hours long but covers all the important sites that side of Berlin and gives you a good starting point for deciding what you want to do for the rest of your stay.

It was packed with a young trendy crowd every night, open til late, serving cocktails and excellent selection of spirits - but, be warned, smoking is allowed which you may love or hate. Amano is a stylish, well-designed hotel with immaculate en-suite rooms, though standard rooms are a bit on the small side - space enough to get round the bed but not much more. Smart, very clean, modern, with a comfortable good-size bed and very sound-proof so noise form the street barely penetrates. The bathroom is well-designed in a clean modernist style with bath and shower over. The buffet breakfast is also excellent and is available until 11, which is just as well if you've been in the bar til late! However breakfast costs 15 euro which is OK if you've got a good appetite but expensive if you only want a coffee and croissant. There's a large lobby/lounge and a roof terrasse (which I guess would be nice in summer). It's position is great - close to Hackescher Market for trendy shops and bars, and is well-served by public transport. There's a great Italian restaurant just 50 metres down Augustrasse (Al Contadino sotte le Stelle) or there's the Transit Restaurant just up the road on Rosenthaler which is much cheaper and noisy but serves tasty Asian food. Hotel Amano is also only a short walk to Museum Island and a bit further to Unter den Linden - the main street which runs up to the Brandenburg Gate.

The Circus hotel is even closer to the Rosenthaler Platz ubahn stop, but this is only a couple blocks away, not an issue at all. The rooms are modern and nicely, though sparsely decorated. As indicated in many reviews, the room is designed somewhat uniquely so that the shower is essentially in the room. Basically, the toilet is its own closet, then you have the sink and shower, then a desk, then the bed. It isn't as weird as it sounds, but it might be an issue if you are sharing the room (depending on whom you are sharing it with). My biggest problem with the room was the rather uncomfortable pillows, which provided no support. Wireless worked quite well in the rooms, as well as the lobby. Though some reviews described the front desk as uninterested, they seemed no different than the front desk staff at any hotel.

It is brilliantly located very near the u8 U-Bahn (Weinmeister-strasse) in Mitte and one stop from Alexander Platz. You can also stroll down to what is deemed the prettiest East Berlin neighbourhood called Prenzlauer Berg. The hotel itself is located near some bars, cafes (Luigi Zuckerman gourmet deli next door do yummy sandwiches!)and there is even a mini market opposite. The hotel breakfast buffet is 11 euros and adequately does the job of filling you up from eggs,bacon , cold cuts, cheese selection,cereal, yoghurts and a variety of bread. The only slight drawback is around peak time of 8.30-9am morning where you could be waiting 15 mins or more for some of the dishes to be replenished. The air conditioning in the room works very well and is a welcomed comfort when temperature outside is a sveltering 35 celsius. As this is classed as a \" budget hotel\" (although I personally would rate this a 4 star boutique hotel), there are no bathroom toiletries aside from shower gel.With a mini market across the road and the great value price you pay for the hotel, its a very small inconvenience . The hotel roof top bar is swanky and also gives a scenic view of Berlin against a backdrop of lounge music- I recommend this more than the downstairs bar . The garden as well is a great place to relax.The only negative comment is that whilst the hotel staff are friendly, not all can speak English well which can be tricky if you needed advise for directions or suggestions.

Our major complaint was that the hotel has no concierge and the front desk was reluctant to help us with travel in the city. They only reluctantly helped us make some dinner reservations. And while the front desk staff was young, they did not appear to speak English well (despite the many young English speaking Germans in Berlin). Our microwave never worked, and while staff arrived to look at it, no one reported back (or fixed it during our stay). The elevator to our third floor was out for several days, and each time we reported it to the front desk, they acted surprised. So, if you want more service from your hotel staff, look elsewhere.

The images they use don't do the place justice and in this, I think the hotel has missed an opportunity ! The immediate location is excellent, with bars, galleries and a real 'arty' feel, which pleased us greatly. ( Up the road just by the U-bahn station is an excellent takeaway place which shares asian and italian business with tables in the middle - eat there it is fantastic and atmospheric !) We also had completely free internet access in the room which is really important to us and felt that this was superb considering it was free. The hotel was good value for money for us as we booked through a discount hotel site some time in advance and paid around \u00a3350 for 4 nights with breakfast - nearer to the time, this would have increased to around \u00a3800 without breakfast and I am not sure the hotel would have been worth that. Some points that the hotel might want to consider .... I didn't think that the absence of tea/coffee facilities in the room would have been a problem, but I really did miss this - I think it is poor of the hotel not to supply this. Also - some other reviewers have mentioned the basic style of the rooms - we didn't mind this, but ours was beyond basic bordering on austere ! Luckily we love the bauhaus style - but be prepared ! More habitat than Ikea decor-wise actually, but not even a canvas picture on the very bare wall ! It was also a room which you could have smoked in - we are both non-smokers but were never asked for a preference. To be fair, it did not smell of smoke but the corridor immediately outside did. Our large window faced an outside bar area where, at certain times of the year (Summer ?), could presumably have been noisy and intrusive. We didn't concern ourselves with any of this due to the bargain booking - had we paid more we may have questioned the rooms location and smoking status. Further points - the help yourself breakfast was extensive and really good - we were never asked for our room number so could have wandered in off the streets which was a little strange ! We were also intrigued how you shared the coffee with strangers on your table, and one day had to clear the previous guests debris to the other end of our table ourselves, where it remained for the duration of our breakfast ! The hot food, bacon, eggs and sausage, were served in 3 large bowls - they were delicious, however, at NO time during the 4 days we ate there were the three items available all at once and we had to wait for eggs for a considerable time on one day in particular - there was really little attention paid to supplying plates as well, so as other reviewers have noted, it was very much self-service and sort things out for yourselves ! I got a little tired of having to continually ask the staff for things at breakfast time - they were pleasant enough but still seemed to concentrate on things that didn't matter or stock up on food items which were already available . I would stay there again providing the prices we paid were still available, but would have complained more if we had paid what I am guessing some people had. One final thing .... and it is really trivial I guess .... the hotel knew from the details I had to complete on arrival, that it was a special birthday for me during my stay. I would have thought the hotel might have had a standard card for this - but yet another opportunity was missed ! I realise that all of this sounds quite negative, but I actually thought the hotel was very good indeed - none of it spoilt my experience and I really enjoyed my stay - it is just that the extra attention to some of these points would have made it even better and in this, I think the organisation have missed a trick ....", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cWell-located and staff is friendly but...\u201d", "Author": "TokyoEric", "ReviewID": "UR81432776", "Content": "Well-located and staff is friendly but room prices are high compared to nearby hotels like The Circus.

On the whole, the hotel staff were very helpful. They phoned attractions and restaurants for us and held our baggage when our room was not ready. I would advise to specify an early check in. We arrived at the hotel at half 12 in the afternoon, and they said the earliest our room would be ready was 4pm (quite late in hotel terms). Breakfast was the best part! A full continental breakfast buffet was included in our rate and it was more than substantial with a huge range of choice and a fair few vegetarian options (hard to come by in Germany with all their meats!).

And my sons were none too impressed by the clear glass shower door - may be more of a problem for friends sharing a room than couples.

I would reccomend this hotel to anyone and I will definetly stay there the next time I go back to Berlin.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cLovely and comfortable hotel right in the middle of Mitte Berlin\u201d", "Author": "earlybird44", "ReviewID": "UR39575947", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Amano at the end of August. It had no reviews when I booked the room as it just opened on August 13. When I arrived at 4 pm my room was not ready but after some discussion I was given another room on the second floor along the Rosenthaler Strasse. The room was small but nicely laid out with two closets to hang up and put your stuff away. There was also a small safe which you can close with your own code. I like the design of the room, spotless white walls, light oak parquet floor, a comfortable double bed with white linnens, soft pillows, a bit too soft actually, and nice light fixtures. The windows are double glazed and have double curtains, one sheer metallic grey and one opaque grey made of a heavy satin. There's a flat screen tv on the wall but the colors of the tv were way off, and I did not know how to fix that with the remote control which had a thousand buttons. Here and there were day-glow pink accents repeated elsewhere in the hotel which worked very well. Nice bathroom with a bath and shower, slate floor tiles and spotlessly clean. Plenty of towels, which were refreshed once during my 3-night stay. Also a hairdryer and a mirror that enlarges your face. Good for plucking stray hairs! Or shaving. Beautiful bathroom fixtures. A heavy door kept all noise out. To get the light and airco working you have to place your room key in the form of a credit card into a slot. When you take it out it shuts off the lights and air conditioning. Spacious lobby with Turkish divans upholstered in grey velvet and some nice old patchwork rugs. Adjacent to the lobby where you pick up one of many Berlin newspapers (all in German) is the breakfast room with many different seating arrangements, one long wooden table surrounded by wooden chairs painted pink day-glow and lovely Hortensia flowers in glass cut vases. For breakfast you could choose from scrambled eggs, sausages and crisply fried bacon, cold cuts, cheeses, lovely jams, and all kinds of breads and danish. There is a great-looking coffee machine which dispenses all kinds of fancy coffees, a choice of teas, juices and pots with regular coffee. Off the hallway to the courtyard there's a little space with two computers with free internet access. When you go to the fifth floor you can walk up two flights of stairs and take a look at the skyline of Berlin from the roof terrace with divans along side, charpoy beds with metallic woven strings, and even a hammock where I dozed off one late afternoon. I rented a bike from the hotel and zipped around Berlin, a great way to visit all of the landmarks without busting your feet. The bike had a basket on the back to put my bag and a big lock so I could fasten the bike to one of the myriad bike stands in the city. It sure was wonderful to go from the hotel to the Staatsoper in 10 minutes and zip back after the fireworks were over. It felt very free and easy and fast and I did not have to deal with figuring out U & S Bahn and bus schedules and stops. With a good map you'll find your way around the city very quickly. The wifi was handy to check mail but each time I wanted to use it I had to enter code and password again. The people working at Armano were very friendly and helpful, one girl brought me my cappuccino on the roof terrace one morning. Right around the corner are inexpensive restaurants and Rosenthalerstrasse is full of interesting shops and clubs. Also important, I felt very safe in the neighborhood of the hotel. Everywhere were little bars and restaurants with people enjoying the balmy evenings. The hotel also has a bar and some chairs and table on the sidewalk. I would have loved to stay longer and I will be planning another trip soon. Berlin is fascinating and the hotel Amano is a great place to stay.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "adelaide", "Title": "\u201cthis hotel was incrediable!!\u201d", "Author": "flocks", "ReviewID": "UR39053712", "Content": "this hotel was amazing! modern architecture with beautiful surroundings close to everything!! my husband and i stayed there for 3 nights and it was great! the staff were extremely friendly and multi-lingual which was good for us because neither of us spoke a word of german! the buffet breakfast was well worth the 11 euro, and the overall price for the apartment was quite competitive. it is situated right near hackersher markt station and only a 5 min train ride from the main centre station. there are some amazing restaurants that are only a 2 min walk down the road. overall we will definitely be coming back here when we return to berlin!! oh yeah, and free wifi throughout the hotel!!", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "israel ' jeruzalem", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel , great stuff , i'll be back !!\u201d", "Author": "pelegeli", "ReviewID": "UR38356517", "Content": "me and my family stayed for four nights, we came very early (7 a.m) and the nice lady at The desk gave us one room although the check in time is at 3 p.m. in the last day the other nice lady let us keep the room, free of charge, until 4 p.m (our flight was at 7 p.m)although the check out time is at 12 p.m Beautiful decorating magazine like rooms, good location, good restaurants nearby.

The hotel is brand new, so the facilities are quite nice and modern. I booked an apartment, so my room was on the 5th floor and pretty spacious. However, the bathroom floor wasn't very clean. The other negative point was that the staff seemed really lost. I believe they had been recently hired, so they couldn't give a very good level of service. I arrived at the hotel at 3pm and my room was not ready, and they acted like it was normal. I also queued a long time to do the check in, and although there were over 7 people at the desk, none would look at me as they were all running around.
