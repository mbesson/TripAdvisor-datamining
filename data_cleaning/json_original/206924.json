This hotel met our expectations. Even though we are in our 60s, we bought a cheap shareable T10 ticket to get from the airport to the Barcelona Sants train station from which we walked to the hotel with our rolling luggage. The next day we took the Metro to the Drassanes Metro stop and then the blue bus (extra fare) to the ship. The neighborhood is quiet and there are lots of cafes and grocery stores nearby, which suited us well as we would be doing our fine dining once on board the ship. Staff at the hotel were very courteous. Considering the ease of transportation in Barcelona and the accessibility of the NH Forum to metro and bus lines, this is a good basic alternative. Metro to Ramblas took about 15 minutes.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely clean hotel with great staff, would definitely recommend!\u201d", "Author": "Kim B", "ReviewID": "UR117330971", "Content": "The hotel was in a great location with Entenca metro station being only a 5 minute walk away. Felt safe when walking back to the hotel late at night. The rooms were spacious and very clean. Nicely decorated. Hotel staff were lovely, they were very helpful and always willing to give advice from a residents point of view. There was also a super market just down the road which we found very helpful as we hadn't opted for breakfast at the hotel.

The staff at the reception is very friendly and helpful. The waitress in the breakfast room though could not speak English, but tried to understand. It was a very decent and comfortable stay. Breakfast was good with a great selection of anything you may ask for breakfast, although when something is finished it takes a while to replace it-or never if it is a late Sunday breakfast. Having the special weekend rate whic included breakfast and free mini bar, we were really happy with it. The only problem is that is more than 500m away from Entenca metro station and almost 1km from Sants, which is not very convenient when you carry luggage (also no elevator in the metro, as in most stations). But there also buses running very close. It easier to reach it from the airport if you take the bus to Plaza Catalunya and then either bus 27 or 30 (we took the train to Sants and then a taxi since it was close, and we had to pay 17 Euros for 1 km, as they charge 2 Euros per suitcase). Internet is very expensive (5,5 Euros for 1 hour and almost 11 Euros for 24 hours). Nevertheless I would stay there again (if it is for leisure and I don't need internet )!", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicestershire", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & very helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "digbyl", "ReviewID": "UR42363130", "Content": "I've stayed at the Forum before & can recommend it.
