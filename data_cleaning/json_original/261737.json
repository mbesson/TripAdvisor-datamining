I'm not usually a 'trip advisor' but having read some of the awful and unjust reviews of this hotel, I felt compelled to 'voice' my opinion. My first trip was a last minute thing where I woke up ad decided to go to London! Having already booked with the hotel for my planned visit 10 days later I contacted the hotel to see what they could do for me for that night. The staff were very helpful and offered me a single room with shower for \u00c2\u00a340. I was very pleased to find a room but also at the rate I was charged. My second trip last night, was to watch the Chelsea v LFC Carling Cup Tie, on this occasion I paid \u00c2\u00a330 for a single room with shower. The beds were very comfortable on both occasions, clean, fluffy white towels were provided, and the rooms were both clean. The location of this place is perfect, your right on the edge of Hyde park, between Paddington and Lancaster Gate Tube Stations - you literally have access to all the tourist sites you could want to visit; and easy access to Stamford Bridge (Fulham Broadway Stn) which was important on my second visit. The hotel offer a continental breakfast with every stay - as I am not an early riser I chose not to take breakfast in favour of an extra hour in bed! Another bonus I found was the check out time of 11.00am, in many other London hotels I have stayed I have rarely had a check out time later than 10.00am. Of all the reviews I have read there arent many that I have found to be a fair reflection, which is dissapointing, as that tells me this site is being abused, to the detriment of hoteliers and also the consumer. If you are looking for a high end establishment, then open your purses and wallets a bit wider and go around the corner to the hilton. However, if you are like me and want somewhere clean, with a bed and a shower, thats in close proximity to attractions and is affordable for your average working class kinda guy (or gal!) this is the place for you! But please dont book here if you have expectations of valet parking, concierge, bell boys, lifts to all floors, champagne receptions etc as you will be dissapointed, though the price point should give you a big clue that these frills won't be provided. In summary, the Lancaster Court Hotel, offers affordable, no frills, accomodation in the centre of one of the most amazing cities in the world. Budget travellers this is definately a place to check out. Please, no more silly reviews...they are very misleading. Thanks for two great stays.

Mustafa!) couldn't have been more helpful and lovely. I had a few valuables on me which i didn't feel comfortable leaving out, albeit in a locked hotel room, and so they locked it away in the reception safe for me.

The water in the shower cabin was cold, the lamp over the wash was out of order but the worst thing was the leaky window. The room was so cold, dark and depressing that I just used it for sleeping, roaming the streets during the daytime. In the night in order to block the wind from blowing in I had to press the curtains against the windows using a drinking glass, a waterbottle, an electrical toothbrush and a shirt. Then I unhooked the bath curtain and used it as an extra insulating by hooking it to the real curtains and pressing the lowest part of the bath curtain to the wall by using the bed.

The shower in the room was a bit awkward and the water pressure low in the hose, toilet in the corridor was always free when I needed it.

There is wi-fi available for pound or two per hour and a public PC to be utilized. My opinion is that wi-fi should be free of charge for guests these days and find it lack of quality in service. There is a luggage room available. It gave a safe impression to notice that the hotel front door is locked at all times.

This is a low rate Bed and Breakfast place. Lots of narrow stairs. I was in an atic room on 4th floor. the website indicates that it is respectable. It is full of elegant pictures. do not be fooled. The room was absolutely discusting. I should have stayed 2 nights but only stayed 1 night. Staff on reception far from helpful. There is no manager on the premisses and the staff say that they have no authority to solve problems Breakfast is the meanest I have ever experience and the staff indifferent to your needs.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coventry, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHotel from Hell!\u201d", "Author": "AngieH22", "ReviewID": "UR79492844", "Content": "The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that the location was excellent. It is a stones throw from Hyde Park and we managed to pre-book a parking space. Other than that it was awful and I'm glad that we only stayed 1 night. We had booked a double ensuite room. What we got was a double room in the basement with a shower cubicle in the corner of the room and the sink and toilet in what can only be described as a cupboard. The room was in desperate need of decorating, the windows didn't lock properly so don't recommend leaving anything valuable in the room if you go out. There was no tea/coffee tray in the room (good job we took our own) and in the morning couldn't even have a shower because there was no hotel water! Forgot to mention that the bed was like sleeping on a concrete slab! For what we paid we could have booked a Travelodge which I know would have been 10 times better.

We carried our exremely heavy packs up four flights of stairs only to find the room we had been given was already occupied - rather embarrasing. I went all the way back down the stairs only to be given a room on the top floor at the other end of the building, so I had to walk all the way back up to get the bags, all the way back down and back up to the top floor. So we weren't in the best frame of mind when we arrived in a room that was tiny, with a shower in the corner of the room, no toilet, a tiny, old bed that sloped horribly to one side and a very small sink. Decor is old, but not in a charming way. We also had to leave our key at reception when we went out, which I found a little strange - especially when they seem to hand out wrong keys. Every time we walked past reception there was someone complaining, the internet was expensive and for the price, i felt this was way below par.

Based on the pictures I expected a nice Victorian style hotel. While it was basically in that kind of style, it was not as nice as the pictures showed and it was in a bit of a state of disrepair. The furnishings in the room were old and very basic. It was very difficult to find an outlet - we finally located one under the little desk. As another reviewer put it, the bathroom was basically shoe-horned into a closet, but at least we had a toilet, sink and shower in our room. The location was excellent - just a few minutes walk to Paddington station and Hyde Park; bus stops were also not a far walk. The hotel had a locked luggage room, so we were able to store our suitcases until later that night since our room wasn't ready when we checked in. This allowed us to go ahead and tour and take advantage of part of our first day in London - precious time for us that we couldn't afford to lose. Breakfast was very basic but we were glad not to have to locate a place to eat and spend the extra money - it included tea and coffee, milk and juice upon request, toast, croissants, jellies, and small packaged cheeses. For the price, excellent location and friendly staff this hotel is fine.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cjust a few improvements\u201d", "Author": "Gizmo_kitkat", "ReviewID": "UR66731550", "Content": "Great location, right beside Lancaster gate tube station, and handy for walks into Hyde park.
