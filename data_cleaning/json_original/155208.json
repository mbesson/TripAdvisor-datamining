The hotel was very nice but, in my opinion, not as nice as some of the reviews here on TripAdvisor. The suite was clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. There were a few things I wasn't particularly happy with. I'd rate the hotel at about 3 3/4 stars if that were possible. Our suite consisted of a large bedroom (the one pictured on the opening TripAdvisor page, at least as of the day I'm writing this), a large bathroom, a decent-sized sitting room, and a hall/foyer connecting the three. Overall, the suite was initially clean and well-constructed, but the furniture was eclectic, in that while nearly every item of furniture was attractive and in the Empire style, few of the pieces looked as though they belonged together. It was as though someone bought various pieces of nice furniture at different yard and estate sales and brought them together - they didn't quite match one another. Dimmer switches in bed, bath, and sitting rooms were a nice touch, as was the fact that all door hinges were well-oiled and didn't squeak. In the bedroom, the matress was very comfortably -- unusually, for both me and my wife. She prefers a relative soft mattress, and I prefer a firm one. This one was firm, but with a very soft top layer, and the sheets were up to my wife's demanding standards (\"smooth and confortable, but still substantial). The curtains worked well, so the bedroom was very dark and easy to sleep well in. Other furniture in the bedroom included desk/chair set, side table (with alarm clock) and another table, comfortable chair, bench at the foot of the bed, television vanity with two drawers for clothes, and a roomy closet. Great bedroom. Bathroom was tiled in marble with a granite sink. Amenities included a large \"double\" jacuzzi (not quite big enough for two), separate comfortably-sized shower stall, mirror, plentiful lights, toilet, plentiful towels, and well-selected toiletries. The only thing noticeably missing was a soap dish for the sink - I disliked having to pry the soap bar from the surface every day. Still, a very nice bath. Sitting room was large enough for two (maybe three or four) to sit comfortably, and the bedroom door permitted one of us to sit up while the other slept. Furniture included a couch, upholstered chair, large coffee table, and several sitting chairs. In the sitting room was a small (larger than dorm size, maybe \"half-size\") refrigerator that was stocked with a few cans of soda and several bottles of beer. Glasses, mugs, a coffee maker, and coffee were provided (as was a wine bottle opener and sugar tongs), but no tea, sweetener, or creamer/whitener. I thought this might be an oversight the first night, but they weren't provided any of the three nights. Actually, we had to ask a few times to have the refrigerator re-stocked, which annoyed me a bit (the sort of nickel-and-dimey thing that ought not to be an issue, in my opinion). Housekeeping was a bit of an issue. Large messes (e.g., wet towels thrown in the tub) were consistently cleaned and the bed was made well each day, but most \"small messes\" were missed. Needlepoint scraps left on the coffee table each night were removed, but left on the floor instead, as were crumbs. The refrigerator wasn't restocked until we asked several times, and sweetener for the coffee provided never arrived (admittedly, I forgot to ask specifically for it, but should I need to?) Also, a few light bulbs remained burned out the whole time we were there. A very nice feature was the balcony attached to the sitting room. During our stay, it was covered with snow, but seemed nice - had a nice view of the side of the Basilica of Notre Dame (bells were not an issue, as I had feared - not that loud). There was a cast iron table and pair of chairs which seemed as though they'd be nice on a pleasant evening. Also nice were the sheer curtains behind the main curtains on two of the windows facing the balcony. (I wish they had had sheer curtains behind the main curtains in the bedroom, too, so we could have had the curtains open while dressing). The staff at the hotel was very helpful and pleasant (all spoke English, too). I appreciated the Internet/printer station in the sitting room beside the lobby. Restaurant Bonaparte is located in the same building, and breakfast is served (not by the restaurant staff) there each morning. Breakfast (included with our stay) was very pleasant - juice, coffee, yogurt of fresh fruit salad, croissants or toast, and a choice of several entrees (french toast was very good, as were the omelettes; crepes were good, but lacked filling). At dinner, the restaurant (now with the restaurant staff) is extremely good. We didn't eat lunch there, but I think it's open for lunch. The hotel location was convenient for touring the old city in Montreal, and was about 3-4 blocks from the nearest Metro (subway) station. For some reason, none of the several cab drivers we used in Montreal seemed to be able to find the hotel, even when we provided the address (easiest way is to tell them either to drop you off at the basilica and walk the last block or tell them to drive 3/4 block around from the front of the basilica). Even with the basilica (and its bells), the neighborhood seemed pretty quiet on Thursday-Sunday. Overall, the hotel was very nice, and I'd stay there again (especially in any of rooms 503, 505, and 507). I don't really think it's quite as nice as some other reviewers make it out to be, though. If the owners read this, I'd recommend paying a bit more attention to stocking the refrigerator and coffee/tea supplies and keeping up the housekeeping for occupied rooms. While checking out, I managed to look in adjacent rooms 505 and 503", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cSimply pefect!\u201d", "Author": "tatina9", "ReviewID": "UR124542089", "Content": "We chose this hotel in part because of its Trip Advisor Rating/Reviews which have never disappointed me.

We took Amtrak up to see the fall foliage along the way, and it was spectacular. After a long day of train travel, we finally arrived at Auberge Bonaparte Hotel. It is a quaint and charming hotel in the old town of Montreal. Every employee we encountered at this hotel did their best to ensure we had a nice stay. We stayed in a room with one queen bed and one double, and it was perfect for the three of us. The beds were very comfortable and the room was beautifully and tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. The bathroom included a large jacuzzi bath and a separate large shower. To me the room looked even nicer than the pics on their web site. The restaurant in the hotel is also very good. It's a quaint and quiet, white table clothed restaurant. We were only there for two nights but we had dinner the first night and breakfast both mornings. We had the 3-course prix-fixe dinner, and I don't remember the exact price but it was around $25-30 Canadian and was a good value and was delicious. The presentation of the food was very European French and looked like art to me. Breakfast is included for hotel guests and is well worth it. The service in the restaurant was quick, friendly and informative without being intrusive. They seemed to sense what you needed before you even asked. The employees working the reception desk were very professional and helpful. They don't have a separate concierge desk, and it's really not needed because the reception desk personnel go out of their way to answer any questions about Montreal, point you in the right direction, recommend restaurants and bars, make reservations for you, etc. A gentleman who worked in the evening (Michael Banks) was especially helpful in giving us advice for a night on the town in the gay village. Every recommendation that he, as well as all the other reception desk personnel made, was spot on. One particular thing that will probably always stay on my mind when thinking about Bonaparte is the 1st morning we were there it was raining. I didn't have an umbrella and before I even opened the door to go outside the person at the reception desk asked me did I need an umbrella. They apparently had a stock of them for people like me who never seem to remember an umbrella when it's needed! It's the little things like this that really make a place feel special. Bottom line is I really have nothing negative to say about Bonaparte. We had a very pleasurable stay there. I will definitely stay there again when I return to Montreal, and I definitely recommend Bonaparte for any traveler to Montreal.

You could also have rooms facing the street but I much preferred the ones on the courtyard.

The first room we stayed in for 3 nights also had a terrace but it was cold and we never used it. Actually room 505 without a terrace is larger and has that same wonderful view. The terrace would probably be nice in the summer but not in October. There is also a rooftop terrace garden . . .small but nice for a drink or coffee.

We chose this boutique hotel based on past Trip Advisor reviews, and must say that overall the past reviews of this hotel are pretty accurate. First of all, this was a very small and clean hotel (No Begbugs !!!). As others have noted, the rooms are quaint and a little sparse - however this and the fact that they rooms have hardwood floors did add to the overall feeling of cleanliness of the room. We also found the room (and floor) very quiet. I usually have problems sleeping in hotels and was worried when we were given the room beside the elevator. However, because there are only maybe 8 to 10 rooms per floor, we had no noise issued and slept very well! We did have a room on the 5th floor at the back of the hotel (overlooking Notre Dame), but the street in front of the hotel seemed very quiet at night, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you would have noise problems with a room at the front of this hotel either. Other thoughts: We very much enjoyed getting up and having the included breakfast that comes with room at the attached restaurant . While not huge, the breakfast is a good quality, allows different choices, and gets you going for the day. While others have noted that the cost of the room is a little pricey (which I also thought), if you remember to factor in the breakfast (~$15/person), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually not too bad of value. We always seemed to be out and about and never ended up eating dinner at the restaurant, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the restaurant quality (too many great outdoor caf\u00c3\u00a9s/restaurants in the area to enjoy!!) The hotel is also perfectly situated for walking! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously great for visiting Old Montreal, but it was also only a 15 minute walk up to Rue St. Catherine for the obligatory shopping trip! The front desk was also very helpful/friendly and helped us order tickets to see a comedian at the Just for Laughs festival (again, only about a 15 minute walk uptown). Negatives: None really! Parking is not at the hotel, but at a small outside lot about 100m up the street. Parking is $15 per day, which I think is fairly reasonable for any city lot. Arriving is a little confusing given the traffic flow and narrowness of the streets. Advice (watched others doing this while enjoying breakfast at a window seat at the restaurant): the street in front is one-way and the hotel has an allowed standing time for unloading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when arriving (if there are spots) stop on the LEFT hand side of the street in front of the hotel and put your flashers on. You can then unload, check-in and get your parking tag that you need for the lot up the street. Only other funny thing we noted was that the rooms do not have movies you can rent. After a long day of walking around, we thought we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d settle back with a bottle of wine and see what new release movies were available for rent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however they only have cable and no Pay per View in the rooms. Certainly not a deal breaker, but a little odd. Overall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Is this really the best hotel in Montreal? Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really comment on that as this is the first and only place we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at in Montreal, so we have nothing else here to compare it to. However, we very much enjoyed our stay, and would not hesitate to stay here again if the opportunity presented itself and would certainly not hesitate to recommend the Auberge Bonaparte to others who are looking for a place to stay in Old Montreal.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga Springs, New York", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "enewellz", "ReviewID": "UR116015737", "Content": "My wife & I decided to stay a few nights in Old Montreal and found the Auberge Bonaparte here on Tripadvisor.

There is a charge, but it is super convenient. The staff was very friendly, especially the concierges we encountered during our stay. They helped us get Grey Line tour tickets, gave good advice for shopping & eating, and exchanged US to Canadian $ at the going rate. The room was beautiful! We stayed in a standard room towards the back of the building. Not exactly a view of Notre Dame, but not bad. Very quiet, never heard the elevator or other guests. The rooftop deck is small but neatly kept, great place to chat with fellow guests. The Auberge is located just a minutes walk from Rue St. Paul, which is where we spent most of our time. You are a short walk from more restaurants, shops, museums and galleries than you will be able to see in a long weekend! We walked around at night & felt very comfortable in this neighborhood. The clincher for us were the breakfasts. If your idea of a great free breakfast is the all-you-can-make waffle bar at most motels, this is not the place for you! These are outstanding. Not a lot, but just enough. French toast, crepes, omelettes, with great coffee, juice, fruit, warm croissants and real butter... mmmm... where was I? Sorry... Anyway, our only regret was not eating dinner there. I know, almost criminal given the restaurant's reputation, but we were always elsewhere when dinner time rolled around.

After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to give Auberge Bonaparte a try and we were not disappointed. The location of the hotel is excellent and in the heart of the Vieux-Port. There were galleries, one-of-a-kind shops, and restaurants and bars all around. There is also a small theatre next door to the hotel which we were going to investigate but ran out of time (next visit!) It is within walking distance of the Metro which quickly whisked us to and from Rue St. Catherine for shopping. The hotel itself is very charming and we found all of the staff to be helpful, professional and very tolerant of our French! I have to say that the hotel staff in particular and Montreal service staff in general took their jobs very seriously whether they were a bar waitress or store clerk - it was very refreshing not to get re-buffed for asking a question. Our room was immaculate with hardwood floors, a double and queen bed and a lovely view of Notre-Dame from the window. Neither of us had any problems sleeping on the mattresses and the beds were comfy - although the room was a bit chilly and there was only one extra blanket which we took turns using. Yes, we could have asked for another one but we were so busy and it was not a big deal. The bathroom had a separate shower and a large soaker tub and there was another sink outside of the bathroom itself which made getting ready much easier. The included breakfast was very nice although we found the choices a bit on the heavy side. If you are into big breakfasts you will be very happy, it was just not how we are used to eating every day and some lighter menu choices would have been great. Having said that we were never unhappy with the quality or taste of breakfast. We had not planned on eating at the hotel restaurant for dinner but ended having to do so one evening because we returned so late. We inquired on our way up to our room if there was anything available for dinner and they very graciously accommodated us even though it was busy. (We did notice that the taxi drivers did not seem to know where the Auberge was but knew the restaurant, always a good sign- by the end of trip we would say we were going to the restaurant and it saved a lot of confusion.) Dinner was very nice and we had the sole which was done to perfection. Again, a little bit heavy, even for fish, but I also attribute that to being on vacation in general and only being able to take so much rich food. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and am hoping to return with my husband as I think it is a great little romantic hotel.

We stayed in a standard room, street side despite some comments about possible noise. I called to book the room and enquire about a CAA discount; was offered $10/night off the rate . Check in went smoothly. We arrived early so our room was not ready but promised it would be done up next. Breakfast was still on so were offered a continental breakfast on the house. We then went for a walk and upon returning an hour later, we were warmly greeted and our luggage all ready waiting for us in our room. The room was quaint, smallish but not squeezed in. Well kept, clean. Not lavish but nicely furnished. No closet but a nice multi purpose wardrobe served well. Windows actually opened. Bed was comfortable. We were on the 3rd floor. Could hear voices from the street, not a disturbance that kept us awake or needed the TV up louder. If there was a large or rowdy group on the street it may have been an issue but not something we experienced in our 3 nights. A small mini fridge/ bar fridge tucked into the wardrobe or nightside table would have been ideal - not having one was my only complaint. Free internet access a plus and breakfast each morning in the restaurant (included in price) was filling and delicious. We had dinner in the restaurant (Bonaparte) the first night. We enjoyed it so much we decided to make reservations for the other 2 nights of our stay as well (I recommend you try it at least once). The staff in both the hotel and restaurant were friendly, helpful, very welcoming. Michael at the front desk was super.

Although not particularly luxurious, it is comfortable and represents a refreshing departure from the ubiquitous, hotel -chain \"formula\" hotels. My husband and I celebrated our 40th anniversary over Labor Day weekend, 2010. Taking a cab from the airport we arrived at the hotel during the mid-afternoon. Our room was ready and check-in was friendly and efficient. Earlier during the week my husband had called to ask the hotel to arrange for a floral piece to be delivered to the room before our arrival. The lovely bouquet was there as requested, and the staff quickly supplied a large vase to accommodate the flowers. Other services, such as reservations, etc. were handled just as efficiently. Our room was somewhat small by US standards, but was certainly adequate for the two of us. Furnishings consisted of a king-sized bed, night table, desk, side table and chair, along with an armoire which housed the tv and two drawers. Hardwood floors and crown moldings added to the charm of the room, which was decorated in creamy gold and red furnishings. Floor lengths draperies framed casement windows with deep window sills, opening to the street below. The bed was comfortable and furnished with feather pillows (important to us, as we dislike foam pillows.) Drinking glasses were made of glass rather than plastic and two complimentary bottles of water were provided. The bathroom appeared to be newly renovated with attractive ceramic tiled walls and floor surrounding a large, whirlpool tub. The pedestal sink was small and there was no counter space. Two small glass shelves accommodated toothbrushes and other toiletries. Everything was very clean. There was a small, elegant restaurant attached to the hotel. We ate dinner there one night, during which the food and service were superb. Our table was on a small balcony overlooking the street below. The atmosphere of Old Montreal is quite charming and we were treated to a vista of hanging baskets of flowers festooning the buildings and horse-drawn carriages traversing the narrow streets. The hotel is located ideally for exploration of the Old Montreal area -- everything is within walking distance. Perhaps the most famous landmark in the area is the Basilica of Notre Dame, located on the next block. Shopping and restaurants are also conveniently located. Breakfast is included in the price of the room (which for us, was about $200. US) This was a far cry from the \"continental\" breakfast bars often found in the United States.

We were greeted warmly and found that we had been upgraded to a king room with a jacuzzi tub; we had originally booked a standard queen room. The room was spacious and clean with views of the street. The decor was classy and understated, real word furniture and hardwood floors, which suited us just fine, and I loved the space in the modern bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the air conditioning worked very well despite the unusual heat wave. The Auberge Bonaparte is very close to the cathedral Notre Dame and near to all the action of Old Montreal. It has a roof deck which guests can use to enjoy the sights, with a fantastic view of Notre Dame. The Bonaparte has a restaurant which served a delicious, substantial, cooked-to-order breakfast each morning (included with the price of each night's stay). Although we didn't have dinner or lunch in the restaurant, the selections looked quite good, and I would consider having dinner there in the future. Parking is available for a fee, and it is in a lot across the street from the hotel and the Centaur Theatre nearby. I highly recommend this option, as street parking is nearly impossible to find, and the narrow streets of Old Montreal are difficult to navigate. Park the car, use it only when necessary, and take advantage of Montreal's metro system. The Place D'Armes station is just a couple of blocks away. The hotel was quiet, the rooms clean and spacious, the location was convenient, and the service was impeccable. I have paid far more for far less in other locations, and I'm happy to report that the Bonaparte went beyond my expectations.

There was a power problem one evening when we returned from the theater. We were given complimentary wine in the restaurant next door and then escorted with lots of candles to our room when it got late. This is an adventure rather than an inconvenience.

The only negative was that if you wanted to read or watch TV at all, it was uncomfortable to do so while on the bed, with its curved iron headboard. However, this is a small complaint - if you are in old Montreal, you will hardly be spending much time in your room. The hotel was perfectly situated for sight seeing. The dinner we had in the hotel restaurant was very well prepared, and the service was good. Our only complaint was our waiter at breakfast the following morning was obsessed with his tip. When he seated us, he mentioned that breakfast was included in the room rate, but please could we note that the service was not included. He made himself very scarce during our breakfast, and it was only when we were about to depart that he rushed over, scanned the table for his tip, and seeing nothing, asked, quite anxiously if we were going to be including it with our room charge. This is something that we are always very conscious of when dining out on a plan where meals are included, and of course we had been prepared to tip generously when we arrived for our breakfast. The fact that the only real interactions we had with our waiter concerned the money we would be leaving left a bit of a bad taste in our mouths, and unfortunately overshadowed what would otherwise have been a really lovely and romantic getaway.

The hotel was clean and the staff were very helpful and polite. I personally found the female staffers much warmer and the male staffer a bit cold, but still very polite.
