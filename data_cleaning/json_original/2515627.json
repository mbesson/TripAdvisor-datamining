A friend visited and we tried the 9th floor terrace. Great space, view, and firepit action... Also had breakfast in the restaurant. Excellent service and food. Really top notch. Since it was a Sunday night with no baseball game, there was no trouble parking at a meter overnight and then paying the meter to stay through breakfast. To top it all off, my stay was actually free, as compensation for a reservation issue with the corporate office. There was no obvious difference from the staff because of it! No attitude at all.

We live fairly close to San Diego and since the kids were gone off to the in laws for the night I decided to give this hotel a shot. I'm a Holiday Inn priority club member & this hotel is part of there chain. I booked this room on line at the last minute using some of my accumulated points and also the whole hotel is pet friendly (no extra charge for pets). I booked a room with a king size bed, while checking inn the staff upgraded us to a suite on the top (12th floor) floor. We were like \"WOW\" a beautiful room w/view. On the 9th. floor they have a grass area where pets can do their business, a big bonus if you bring fido. The downstairs bar & restaurant area were very nice as well. Had a couple of drinks before heading out (drinks were awesome) & breakfast the following morning. Breakfast was good, limited menu and kinda pricey, still a good deal since your dog is also welcomed. Parking @ $38.00 a night is expensive you need to consider your options though. Either put coins in a meter every 2 hours (more expensive) or park a few blocks away at a 24 hr. parking lot near the stadium (not the best area to leave your sports car overnight). People you're in a city atmosphere, parking always comes at a premium. I would have gave this a 5 star rating only if they had better pillows on there beds. Pillows needed to be twice the size and softer.

Especially well-tuned is the cheerful, intelligent staff. For a pleasant place to stay in downtown San Diego, you can't go wrong with the Indigo as a less traditional and more personal experience. The downside factors result from an obvious decision to save costs on common services that are not immediately visible, for example: the breakfast experience. The hotel does not have a full service restaurant but blends a bar and tables into an attractive eating area. The problem is that the food is far beneath the quality of the hotel's physical and human appeal, below even the meager offerings of a downscale franchise chain. We're talking \"croissants\" that are limp and rubbery, one kind of bagels (egg) that are as hard as a rock, and no jams or preserves except for little plastic containers of Smucker's grape and mixed-fruit jelly. Except for the good coffee, the breakfast is strictly school cafeteria-quality. For a hotel that often charges over $250 a night for a room, this is really unacceptable. Other missing services are also noticeable, for example I found no place on site to buy sundries or newspapers (they tell you to go down the street to the 7/11 to do that), although copies of USA Today -- if that can be considered a newspaper -- are provided.

I submitted the price adjustment request via their webpage which promises a response within 24 hours. Not only did I never receive any kind of response, calls to the hotel were met with requests that I call back at another time to catch a manager on duty, a reservationist who refused to take a message and pass it on to a manager, and when I finally did catch someone on duty, a response along the lines of \"Well I'm sure you've referred to our webpage that lists all of the exceptions to this guarantee.\" Nice.

It's not luxurious, but it has some panache and doesn't disappoint relative to pictures on the website. The rooms have wood floors, a nice touch. Ours had a curved wall at the closet, breaking up the usual rectangular hotel room monotony. Colors and wall patterns are warm and agreeable. The same goes for the hallways, which gives a welcoming and comforting feel to arriving at one's room. Views can be good. The bathroom is spacious, functional and attractive. Beds are OK, nothing special, which, unfortunately, is the norm in lots of, but not all, hotels. There's no refrigerator or microwave. I think it's $10 a night for the frig; I don't know about a microwave. That's too much for such a simple convenience and was probably the thing I felt least positive about during our stay. To be able to store a few snacks that require refrigeration isn't much to ask. At least internet usage is free. You have a choice of either wifi or ethernet. The lobby is welcoming and bright, casual with character. A couple of iPads and iMacs (running Windows, oddly) are available for use. There's an adequate 24 hour exercise room and a pleasant 9th floor terrace overlooking Petco Park. There's not a pool, which was fine on pleasant, but not hot December days. But I could see where some would find this to be a shortcoming. The staff is helpful, pleasant and professional. I'm fine with saving energy and expenses by not providing new towels, toiletries and such every day, but I'd say that room cleaning could have been a bit more thorough. A couple times, we'd been to the beach and tracked a bit of sand into the room, nothing at all extreme, but it was there. It would have been nice had it been swept or vacuumed more carefully. Not to overstate it, though. The room was sufficiently clean. The Gaslamp District is touristy to the point where we didn't bother with it, but even for those taking advantage, I'd think being just outside it, as this hotel is, is a big plus for avoiding excess street noise. It's not exactly quiet, but for an urban location, it's not bad. I like the East Village location, surrounded by condos. It feels a little like living there because of that. The nearby and underrated ballpark gives great ambience as it dominates the neighborhood with a sort of mythic presence and easy views into the stadium. It's minutes away from Balboa Park by car and a walk to the harbor. Some nice SD neighborhoods (South Park, North Park, Hillcrest) surround Balboa Park and having them so close is great for restaurants, cafes and walking around. Other in town beach areas aren't that far, either. The light rail is just a couple blocks away. Valet parking is expensive (though the valets are great), but there are some good alternatives. On some nights, street parking is easy. A couple of nearby lots are $5 for 10 hours on weekdays/nights, $10 on weekends. There are other lots, too. Careful, though \u2014 on the street, the police will ticket you if you give them the chance. All in all, we had a very nice stay here. It's a fine, if not extraordinary hotel and I'd stay there again if I were looking to be in the downtown San Diego area.

They put me in room 202 which was a handicap-accessible room on the second floor (202), possibly because I prepaid using a discount rewards program. It was fine for what I paid (about $100 a night), but if I had booked directly with the hotel I would have requested a room change. The room was very large and in wonderful condition. Three minor points: there was a pipe that made a clicking noise in the heating vent in the bathroom which was annoying, but by closing the bathroom door I was not disturbed by it. The hot water turned lukewarm on 3 of the 5 mornings I used the shower at around 8 a.m. Third, room 202 is above then kitchen so I could smell breakfast cooking in the morning and steak and burgers at night. If this is a turn-off, make sure you are not assigned room 202. The bed was extremely comfortable. Free wifi. Window in the room opens for fresh air which is also nice. Large closet for all my stuff. I ate in the hotel dining room one morning for breakfast and it was ok. The scrambled eggs with spinach were good but the potatoes were cold. With coffee and tip it was nearly $20. The rest of my stay I ate around the corner at Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys which I recommend for the best bagels in San Diego. They make a variety of sandwiches and with coffee it was usually around $8. Service was very fast and friendly. There are a couple of other bars and restaurants within 1-2 blocks of the hotel; a Thai place, a bar/restaurant/bowling alley, Basic pizza (very good!), Smash Burger, a 7-eleven one block toward the baseball stadium, and a CVS on Market ST and 6th? There is a Starbucks two blocks away too if you require one. The neighborhood is called East Village and it is about 3 blocks from the Gaslamp District. I liked being far away from the madness of Gaslamp but close enough to walk there anytime, even evening. The closest trolly stop is on Market and Park, another 3 block walk. The further east you walk (toward the trolley stop) the sketchier the neighborhood becomes, but I had no problems. I probably would not walk off Market street alone a late at night in that area by the trolley. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego; and many are in this area too. However I was never bothered by anyone; no one even asked for a handout. There is always police presence at the Market and Park trolley stop. I did not have a car and used public transportation to get to the zoo, La Jolla, Old Town, Harbor Island for a whale watch trip. You can buy an all-day pass (includes trolley and local bus service) for $5. A great buy as the taxis are a bit high. I did take one early in the morning to go from the hotel to the Sheraton on Harbor Island Drive (3 miles) and it was $16 and a 10 minute ride. Took the bus back for $2.25. Seaport Village is within walking distance, 10 blocks directly east toward the harbor. You can literally see the Petco Stadium from the hotel. It's 2 blocks away. I pre-booked with SuperShuttle online and had airport to hotel (and return) shuttle service for $16 round trip. A great bargain and painless. Shuttle was waiting for me at the airport after I got my luggage.

Thanks again you both deserve praise for your hard work!! Second: let's address the bad. Chris if you do not know what your doing ask someone who does. He told me a certain amount of money was going on my card and then charged the entire upgrade fee to this card folded up the receipt and said have a great day. I walked out looked at the receipt and he charged the full amount to this card. I went back in asked why he did that and I got the deer in the headlight stare. Third: I stayed here because it was assigned as a low rate on a third party website. Well the room was too small for my family we asked for a larger room the request was granted for 60 additional per night we were fine with that because we were going to eat up the cost we paid and stay elsewhere. Well we should have stayed elsewhere. On my second day there I get a call from my credit card company saying they detected fraud on my card because of three different authorizations of which I was not aware of I let them know I was staying there but that did not matter so I currently have a lock on my account until I provide the cc company with receipts. The hotel charges 75 for each day you are there and on one night they charged me 13 dollars and no one had an explanation as to why it was done. I asked on more than one occasion to speak to the hotel manager with no response he either was not in or could not be found. I also requested that he phone me on my cell also with no response.The last night we were there I walked into my room which had not been thoroughly cleaned a dust pan was left on my living room table and apparently the maid broke something in our room because my one year old daughter picked up a large piece of glass and handed it to my husband.

Upon arriving, we were upgraded to a nicer room for joining the rewards program. The front desk staff was very accommodating. The room was very nice with modern furnishings, comfortable beds, spacious bathroom, and a nice westward view. The flat screen HDTV was also a nice bonus. We only had a few problems, which were very minor but added up to annoyances. For example, one night one of us had a craving for a chocolate chip cookie and we were elated to see in the hotel info card in our room that room service was available 24hr AND they had CC cookies!! Imagine our disappointment when we called and were curtly told that room service was not available until 6AM :( Another very picky point, was the complimentary coffee, which was awesome that we had our very own Keurig coffeemaker in the room, but there was only one caffeinated coffee packet (in addition to 2 teas and a decaff coffee packet). The staff was happy to bring up a couple extra caf. coffee packets when we called though, however the next day we had the same situation. Yes, I know, this is EXTREMELY minor, it's free coffee! Lastly, we looked forward to enjoying a drink at the hotel terrace bar before we left for the airport, but it was closed (as it was one night earlier) even though it was an hour after the advertised opening time. So instead we grabbed a drink at the first floor hotel bar which was nice (decent happy hour) but not the same as enjoying the San Diego skyline while sitting around a roof-top fire. Also the location is great, just blocks from 5th street, which is filled with great bars and restaurants. Also close to public transit stops if that's your thing.

If you are into Halloween, San Diego is party central! But it is so noisy until the bars close down at 2am. Our fan didn't work in the room, so in order to get air circulating we had to have the window open a crack. When we asked to move to another room, they were quite certain that this was not possible. One visit to the front desk, and 2 phone calls and they were finally clear that we wanted another room. They just couldn't move us immediately, which we understood--but we wanted to sleep in another room the next night. I suggested that they store our luggage until another room was open, and they finally decided that was possible. When we got back from the wedding reception that night, we did have another room! They said our luggage would be in our room, but it was not. Another call to the front desk, and it was delivered. The hotel website and the literature says daily newspaper. When we asked about this, we discovered daily to them means Mon-Fri not on the weekends. They don't have towel racks in the room! For a green hotel, that does not want to wash your towels everyday, it is hard to have dry towels, if you can not hang them up. They do have hooks, but only 2, one for a hand towel, and one for a bath towel. And there were 2 of us in the room. They only gave us one package of coffee, it seems as if they are set up just for single people staying in the room. We had to request more coffee. Parking is $35, which is quite steep. Normally we would have just parked on the street, but with the wild party going on, we decided it was best to do valet. All in all, I don't think that we would stay here again.

We had a corner room on the 7th floor with a direct view of Petco Park. The room had good airconditioning, large tv, writing desk, an excellent bathroom with large shower and good water pressure. The king bed was very comfortable with numerous pillows, which I found to be too soft. In saying that, I found all pillows in the US to be the same. Breakfast was included in the room rate, available on the ground floor in the bar area. The menu was limited to a variety of eggs, fruit and juices. You nearly always get a side of toast and potatoes - potatoes I find a bit strange for breakfast!!. The breakfast is covered by a coupon to the value of $20.00 so it depends on your selection as to whether you pay extra. We found this happens alot in hotels across the US. The staff were friendly, the free internet ivia 2 new computers in the lobby was welcomed. The bar served good drinks for our night caps and also some food (limited menu) for those late hunger pains. There is also a roof top bar so when the baseball is on, you can sit up nthere and watch the game. Drinks are not served in glasses, but in plastic cups, whcih I do not like to drink my wine out of plastic. The reason behind this is some guetsts of the hotel decieded it would be fun to throw their glasses over the balaconey to the street below, where neighbours complained.

Here are our notes by category: Location: we loved the location. It was right on the edge of the Gas Lamp District, so out of the fray and hectic environment of the District, but close enough to access all of the things to do there. Amenities: the gym is awesome. Perfect amount of equipment and when we went (mid-October), there was always equipment available to use. They have Life Fitness equipment, which is a great brand. There are two TVs and it can get a little loud with the acoustics in the room, but overall, we were very pleased with the gym. We had coffee/tea in the room, which we enjoyed. Free wireless was a plus, but we didn't use it very often b/c we were out all of the time. The iHome clock radio was nice as we did plug in our iPod. Overall, the amenities were just right. Restaurant/bar: not impressed with the food quality or service. It's not that it was bad, but we expected a little better after reading that the hotel supports local fare. With all of the other dining options, we forewent the convenience of the hotel for any meal and ventured out on the town. There is an outside bar on the 9th floor, but we didn't spend any time there outside of doing a brief walk through. Room cleanliness: the room was very clean. Having hardwoods, especially in a hotel that allows pets, was a plus from the cleanliness factor, but we heard our neighbor early every morning as she walked around her room in her high heels. There were a few items missing when we checked in (no bath/shower mat, missing coffee/tea and mug), but they brought them the next morning when they cleaned the room. The housekeeping staff was pleasant. Overall, the rooms were clean (which I would expect no less) and we would give them a middle of the road on comfort b/c of the noise from the hardwoods and it feeling a little more industrial than we're used to. Staff: this is where we felt the hotel fell short. The bellman was nice and asked us lots of questions (where we went that day, how our stay was, etc.). But, the front desk staff was not as personable. It was not that they said/did anything wrong, but they just weren't as friendly as we had read about in reviews. We had handful of requests during our stay at the hotel and they were slower to respond and did not follow up. If I had not read the reviews about the staff being so wonderful before we came, our expectations would have been lower and it would have been normal, run of the mill hotel staff. But, we had higher expectations, which we felt were not met. Again, it's not that they did anything wrong, they just weren't what we expected after reading the reviews. Overall, we would recommend the hotel with some reservations. If you are looking for more upscale, plush rooms (like the US Grant), this is not your place. It seems best fit for younger (30's and 40's), more mover/shaker adults.

We had a fabulous time. Here's why: VALET: There is no parking garage at Hotel Indigo but there is a valet. It costs $35/night. Yikes! I know that seems high but it's open 24 hours and the attendants are extremely professional and very fast. I honestly dont think I waited more than 3-5 minutes for the car each time. Also, they were extremely helpful with directions when asked. HOTEL & FRONT DESK: The hotel is really beautiful. When you walk in, you certainly have a regal boutique feel. The decorations are tasteful and up to date. The front desk was very friendly, quick yet attentive and helpful. David checked us in and he was very sweet. The lobby has two computers downstairs w/ free internet and free printing. This was helpful when I needed to print my plane ticket. They also have free internet in the room GYM: Decent sized gym. Exactly what we expected. Enough equipment for a quick workout and very clean. If you want a real gym there is one right around the corner called FIT. RESTAURANT: Kind of expensive but that's to be expected at a hotel restaurant. Strong drinks. Good food. THE ROOM: As you can see from the pictures I attached, the room was really gorgeous. We stayed in room 814 and I suggest requesting a CORNER room. The view of the stadium was really nice and the sunlight in the morning so wonderful. This is a dog friendly hotel but you would never know it. The floors are wooden which I LOVE so there is no dirty carpet smell. The bed comfortable and the linens extremely clean. Lots of channels to surf on the flat screen tv. The bathroom was big BUT the only only drawback was the shower. While it's a nice big walk in shower, the shower head looked kind of cheap and did not give off much water pressure which left you standing in one place trying to get wet and not freeze. They really need to put in a nicer rain forest shower head to fill up the space and make it more luxurious feeling. In terms of maid service, some of the other reviews Ive read says they didnt replenish or clean every day. This is a GREEN hotel people. You have to hang the \"Please Service My Room\" tag on the door knob when you leave for the day for them to come clean. LOCATION: The location is on the outskirts of the Gaslamp Quarter but honestly it's SO close in walking distance to all the bars at night etc. If you're gay, rent a car and it's a short distance to the Hillcrest area. No biggie. The area is very clean and a 5 minute walk from the stadium.

In fact I really like the location/neighborhood. It would be the must stay place if in town for a Padres game with a very cool gastropub (Knotty Barrel) across the street. The room was nice and clean - I really liked the wood floors. The whole reason we stayed here was because it was a LEED hotel and wanted to check that out. The one thing that people should be aware of is that it is a pet friendly hotel....that did not bother me - but it may some people if they have allergies or not into animals. There was some barking on our floor but it was not disruptive - but something to consider, again, if you are not an animal lover. We had a drink at the roof bar - great views - but limited selection. The staff was friendly and helpful from check in to the valet drivers. When we stayed there I was thinking that I was all set to give 4+stars, but then we had a negative situation with the management/housekeeping. Upon arriving at the airport my husband realized he left 2 shirts behind laying on the bed as he was packing. Yes, it is his fault that he forgot them - but he immediately called the hotel and they said he needed to email the manager of the lost and found as he was not working at that moment. He emailed him requesting that the shirts be mailed and that he would cover the cost for the shipping and any inconvenience this caused. When we did not hear back - so we called the hotel again and they said he was the person we needed to speak with and he was off. 2 days later we received a succint email saying the items were not found and to call the housekeeping manager if we had further concerns. We called her immediately and she said she did not have the items in her lost and found, but would check again and return my call. She did not return the call so I called again the next day and left a message and still we have never heard back from her. This was disappointing on many levels. Yes I realize that it was our responsibility to remember the items - however - we callled immediately and were sent through a lengthy process of days where obviously someone saw the items and claimed (stole) them. I find this very disturbing that the housekeepers or other employee would find it \"okay\" to take something left behind in a room. I understand if something goes unclaimed for weeks or months the hotel has to have a way to deal with the items, but we called the day we checked out, sent emails and followed up to no avail. It is not that the items were expensive or unique - it is more the principal of the matter and how poorly Hotel Indigo handled the situation. I think they may want to set a policy for their housekeepers/employees that taking something that is left behind by a paying guest is theft and not acceptable. So if not for that incident it would have been a 4 stars - but could not give more than the 2 stars because it left a bad taste in my mouth!", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cAwesome - First time traveling alone...\u201d", "Author": "P S", "ReviewID": "UR117776921", "Content": "Hey you...

If I didn't know it, I would never guess it was owned by Holiday Inn. It has a downtown boutique feel and attention to design that is very unusual in a chain. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The valet always asked us if we needed directions, and the gentleman who checked us out did the same, along with giving us a breakfast recommendation. The front desk called about 5 minutes after we arrived in the room to ask if everything was okay. The room rate was very reasonable for what we got: a huge room decorated in a lovely orange and blue color scheme, Keurig coffee maker, sleek, modern and VERY clean bathroom with lots of granite and beautiful tile in the huge walk-in shower with frameless glass door. Lots of little extras like a full size hair dryer, bottled water, an ipod docking station alarm clock (make sure to dim it before you fall asleep-- it's bright!)... and did I mention the view? We're Priority Club members, so they gave us a free upgrade to a king-sized room on the 8th floor with a view of Petco Park. Amazing. The elevators are fast and secure (you have to insert your room key to use them, which I liked), and the hotel is environmentally friendly. Apparently, it was the first hotel downtown that was ever LEED certified. The last night we were there, they slipped a letter under our door offering us to stay there the next night for only $99.00. Unfortunately, I had already booked another non-refundable room somewhere else, so this came a little too late, but we would have gone for it if we hadn't already made other arrangements. The only negatives I can think of: valet parking was pricey at $35 per night, but I'm guessing that's comparable to other hotels in the area. The bar on the 9th floor was a very nice atmosphere (incredible view) but I found the cocktail selection limited and very pricey (over $11 per drink). Again, though, perhaps that's comparable to other hotels in the area. The water in the shower didn't get very hot at 5:00 PM-- really only about lukewarm. I'm guessing that's because their hot water heaters are set on a timer to only heat at peak shower times. I appreciate the conservation aspects of that but dang, I really wanted that hot, pre-dinner shower since we'd been out walking around all afternoon. If you want to stay somewhere that feels a little more special than the run-of-the-mill hotel, but you don't want to pay Ritz prices, Hotel Indigo strikes a really happy medium. If I have the opportunity to visit the Gaslamp area of San Diego again, I will definitely stay be staying at Hotel Indigo.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cStaff Lied and Refused to Allow Guest to Check In\u201d", "Author": "jdhollinger", "ReviewID": "UR117564536", "Content": "I called ahead to request permission for a member of our party to check in before we arrived.

Would be great if they could have an umbrella in each room in case someone needs one-the airlines lost my bag so I was without my rain jacket. Check in and out was good and both receptionists were very friendly and helpful. But after checking out we sat for 25 minutes with our bags waiting for the valet to get our car. They didn't appear busy at all so when we finally went up to talk to them told us they had forgotten about us. That was pretty bad service, especially because we were in a hurry and they weren't apologetic at all.

The location is wonderful and the hotel and rooms are very nice, modern, clean and well kept. The front desk staff was nice upon check in and out. The maid service was ok, I suppose. They didn't seem to want to replenish the soaps and shampoos thinking that those tiny bottles would last two people three nights. Making the bed consisted of pulling the sheets and blankets up and piling on the numerous pillows which left a lumpy look to what was a very nice bed. They left used paper coffee cups and glasses on the tables where I or my daughter left them. I guess cleaning or replacing used cups and/or glasses was not part of the maid service. Sometimes they replaced the bottle of water in the room, sometimes they didn't. The shock about that bottle of water is that it cost $5! No where did it say they would charge for that water, there is no mini bar, so I assumed it was complementary to the room just like the coffee and tea so imagine my surprise to see a charge to my credit card after I get home for a $5 bottle of water! When I called to ask what the $5 charge was for, the very rude man who was answering the phone huffed and puffed and sighed at the terrible inconvenience i was putting him through. When I asked who was supposed to tell me that there was a charge for the water or where was it supposed to say as such, he said it should have been on the bottle and that he could remove the charge and hung up. So, we will see if it is removed.. something tells me it will not be. At least they got the $35 per night charge for valet parking correct....

The decor is attractive, with (apparently) wood floors, cool earthy colors, and modern bath furnishings and electronics. But a hotel room is first and foremost a place to sleep, and that's where this one fails to hit the mark. Noise, or rather, lack of adequate soundproofing between rooms appears to be the culprit. Every door closing, every conversation in the hallway was clearly audible (and I do mean clearly--we learned way too much about our floormates' personal lives). TVs in adjoining rooms were not as clearly audible, but the bass came thumping through. And those hardwood floors? It means any time some in the room above dropped something hard or walked across in a hard-soled shoe, we got to hear it. Street noise, even on a higher floor, was also quite strongly heard in the room. Second problem: the bed was a reasonably firm one, but as a king-size, it still had four small and unpleasantly foamy pillows, the kind I'd expect at a Holiday Inn Express, instead of the large, cushy pillows I'd expect at an upscale hotel. No extra blankets or pillows in the closet. The bathroom was attractive, but had no tub, just a walk-in shower, which I actually prefer but not all do. There were no washcloths when we checked in, and no floor mat the next day. Wet tile floors, whee! No robes provided, another common amenity for a true upscale hotel. The much-advertised views of Petco park are oversold. The park is two full blocks away from the hotel, so one is looking between other buildings into the park. It's more interesting than looking at more high-rises, but don't think you'll really be watching a game from your room, at least not without serious magnification. Lobby and bell staff were friendly when approached directly, but otherwise detached. Never a \"good evening\" or \"welcome back\", even when they weren't otherwise occupied. Someone in management is still thinking too down-scale. IHG needs to put some line staff from Intercontinental in place to touch up service. Even then, the main problems are structural.

The property is hip and modern, with a rooftop bar where you can look right down on Petco Park while you enjoy a cocktail. I decided not to fight the parking issue; if you want to stay in a downtown, city hotel, accept the reality of valet parking costs, or stay elsewhere. The valet service was pleasant and quick; I never had to wait long for my car. My room was spacious and clean, and the bed was excellent -- combined with the surprisingly quiet a/c, I got some of the best sleep I've ever had in a hotel room. The bathroom is modern and attractive, with a very roomy shower, plenty of towels, and a great hair dryer. My only criticism would be that, despite the \"green\" emphasis and request that guests re-use towels (which is always fine with me), there was only one towel hook -- not a rack or bar anywhere -- making it pretty difficult to dry towels for re-use. In-room coffee was the \"cup at a time\" system, and the maid did keep me well supplied with coffee pods... but I find it wasteful and silly to generate plastic trash for every cup of coffee. Again, this is a hotel which prides itself on its LEED certification, so I find that perplexing. There was good closet space, plenty of real hangers, an IPod docking station, free WiFi, an in-room safe, and a free business center in the lobby. The decor was cool and attractive, there was good natural light, and a window that actually opened -- rare in hotels. I also appreciated the security of the keycard-controlled elevator. I was probably most impressed by the staff at the Indigo. From check-in to check-out, they were genuinely friendly and service-oriented. I ate one breakfast at Table 509; the food was quite good and the service was excellent.

They are 100% pet friendly and my dog was very comfortable staying here. Dogs are allowed in EVERY part of the hotel including the bar and restaurant area. I booked a King City View Room and requested a high floor for $135.00 a night. Upon arrival the valet was exceptionally friendly, they were very professional and really went above and beyond my expectations. Upon check in i was greeted by a front desk employee.. don't remember his name, i think it was Deider, anyway he was VERY UNPLEASANT. He didn't say hello, didn't give me any information about the hotel, or anything in the surrounding area, didn't tell me that there would be a $75.00 AUTHORIZATION HOLD on my credit card for incidentals , and he didn't really seem to throw a smile or be happy to have a job, or even be alive for that matter. He was kind of rude and just bitter as he handed me my hotel keys and credit card back. (Seriously if you hate your job that much and are in a bad mood, there are plenty of other people who are up beat and have a personality who can do his job 100 times better) anyway, we checked in and to my surprise was on the 11th floor. I thought the hotel only had 9 levels so this was a surprise (they have 12). The room was exceptional, very spacious, very clean, very modern, and overall A+. As part of bringing a dog to the hotel they offer a ruff life package according to their website where a dog bowl, and dog bed are provided. This was not so I called the front desk and got the same jerk who checked me in and he never followed up with me, it took an hour to get a dog bowl. Anyway on a positive note - EVERYTHING about this hotel is great, all the staff was very nice and friendly (other than the first guy). Housekeeping was a bit on the poor side, it took 1/2 hour to get towels, 1/2 hour to get anything and I had to request maid service. I mentioned this to the front desk upon checkout and to my surprise for the inconvenience they credited me $35.00 (one day) toward the valet parking. I recommend the Valet, it is $35.00 per night but totally worth it, yes there are other lots on the street for $10-$15 less, but they go unmanned at night and anything can happen. This hotel is literally within walking distance to 5th Avenue and Market St. which all the nightlife is on, there are a ton of bars, restaurants, hookah lounges, cigar lounges, coffee shops and so much culture and is very exciting and ALIVE during the day and after 5pm. It is a very quick 10 minute drive to Ocean Beach (Dog Friendly Off Leash Beach), Sea World and other beaches in the area. The hotel is also one block away from PetCo field where the Padres play, and you can get a great view of the game from the Hotel's 9th Level Rooftop Bar for free. The area south to the hotel (East of 11th Avenue) known as \"the east village\" is kind of sketchy, but it looks as the neighborhood is upcoming. Overall, I'd stay here again, they took care of my problems and always greeted me when i returned back to the hotel with a smile and a hello...even at 2AM. Even the Valet remembered where i was going and asked me how was the beach, how was the bar etc. If you are looking for a good walking distance to all the nightlife and culture, this modern hotel is definitely the place. On my last night there, i was surprised to find in my room under my door an invitation to stay an extra night at $99.00. This is something I have never seen before anywhere else and if I had the extra time to spare i should would have taken them up on their offer as I could have used another day in San Diego. Excellent Customer Service other than the jerk who checked me in at the beginning. I am happy that my overall experience was redeemed by everyone else and his attitude at the beginning didn't leave me with a negative impression of hotel and it's service. I highly recommend this hotel, and highly recommend you utilize the valet service.

It's a bit further from the Harbor activities but not an impossible walk. The rooms are very nicely done --larger than most hotels at that price range--modern, restful decor both in the rooms and the lobby; clean. We were on the 6th floor but it was somewhat noisy down on the street at least until 2am but then you are in the middle of an entertainment area in a big city so to be expected. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from both Petco and it's on the edge of Gaslamp. The service throughout the hotel, with one exception, is excellent. Check in and out is great (special commendation to Darren the desk manager who was particularly nice, as was the other lady at the front desk when we left). My wife left her purse in the bar the night before we left, and we didn't notice it until the next morning. She called down and it was delivered to our room immediately. So the hotel in general is a very good value and very pleasant. The one exception on service and value is the breakfast restaurant (near the bar). First, there is very limited choice on eggs--scrambled, scrambled, or scrambled in various forms. No choice. Second . We came down for bkfst within the specified serving times on a Sunday morning. No one was there to seat us, so we just sat down at a table. There were 4 waiters and maybe 8 tables filled so it wasn't very busy or full. We waited 10 minutes for service and then it wasn't the waiter who came over to take our order but the great Darren who from the front desk noticed we had not gotten served and took it upon himself to come over and take our order. On the way out same thing happened--we asked for the check and waited. And waited. One waiter passed our table and indicated it was coming. It didn't. We don't know what the restaurant manager was doing at the bar but he wasn't getting our check. Finally 10 minutes after we asked for it, we looked over and even he had disappeared as had all the other waiters! So we just got up, left and told Darren at the front desk what we were doing and to just add any charges to our bill b/c we were tired of waiting. They did. And when I told the other lady at the desk on check out what happened, she very nicely did the right thing and as compensation took our bar bill from the last night off the final bill.

The ONLY downside was the $35 valet parking fee. I live in Los Angeles, so expect to pay something, but I thought it was a bit overpriced. If you're planning on going to a game, you probably want to factor in the convenience factor. Petco Park charges $15 - so for another $20, you can walk to the park in one block. And then walk back to your room in under 3 minutes and not have to worry about getting your car out of the Petco lot and get back to your room. Is it worth it? Depends on your frugality factor. I had my teenage son with me, so I thought it was probably worth it. I'd definitely stay at the hotel again. \u00c7omfy comfy beds, and more towels than we used. I love that. If all hotels knew how much women appreciate abundant towels and cozy sheets, they could skimp on other stuff and make us happy!", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat value and fantastic staff\u201d", "Author": "Sellmatt", "ReviewID": "UR105266852", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at this wonderful hotel for 3 days.

He remembered me by name after just one conversation and was always approachable if we needed something! The room was clean and visually appealing. The front desk staff even called up to our room to make sure things were ok. We asked if there was a drugstore nearby because we needed toothpaste and without hesitation they brought a tube up. Loved the 9th floor bar. On our last night Wlliam was the bartender and the service was amazing. He had a lot of people to deal with but somehow managed to make us feel like we were his only customers! Great customer service. Although we got the deal from hotwire and weren't sure what we would be getting, our expectations were exceeded.

At first, when looking on the map and seeing where the hotel was located compared to the hotels that were closer to the convention center, I was worried it would be too far away. Now, after the stay is complete, I consider myself lucky!! First, this hotel is bright and cheery. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and ensure you have everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. Same goes for the bar/restaurant, Table 509. The bartenders/servers Adriana, William, Ish- all fo them- make you feel welcome, take the time to listen to what you like and make the best drink recommendations based on what you offer up. Love that! Now, to compare this hotel to say, Hard Rock, near the convention center is almost unfair! It's literally like night and day. Also, any hotel near the convention center deals with the trolley and train ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT! I can't tell you how many of my colleagues had sleepless nights because of that alone! Other great things to note about Hotel Indigo are that it's pet-friendly (although I only saw dogs), they have great specials throughout the week, and the stadium (Petco Park) is just a block away! They do offer valet parking for $35 a day but there is street parking available some times, too, just beware you're on the right side due to street cleaning! (San Diego is so clean!) All in all- a wonderful spot. I was on the 10th floor- the room was spacious and cheery! The beds are super comfy (four pillows to each bed and they are soooo soft and fluffy!)

We came downtown during a padres game and had no trouble getting our cars parked with their valet. The rooms were fantastic. We were on the 8th floor with a good view of the ballpark (about half the field). The room was so quiet with the window shut, and even though they allow pets, we only heard a dog barking once (and not at night). When we booked the rooms and called the restaurant for brunch reservations the staff was really friendly and asked if the booking was for a special occasion. When we arrived, the manager had a festive champagne and OJ tray delivered to the bachelorette's room. She was so surprised, and so were we! It was an incredibly nice touch. The beds were sooooooo comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. And even though the rooms are bright and cheerful, there are blackout curtains to get some much needed sleep after a girls night out. The location of the hotel is also a huge plus. We could walk to the restaurant and club that we visited that night. It was really convenient. We ate at the restaurant in the lobby for breakfast and really enjoyed the meal. The service was friendly and fast, and the food was nicely presented, which is surprising for a breakfast meal. Everything tasted great (I had the breakfast burrito, but i also tried my friend's monte cristo and another girl's croissant sandwich), and the prices were reasonable. To top it off, they automatically set us up with a late checkout for 2:00 PM.

We were able to get an upgrade on our room since we mentioned it was our first year anniversary and we had a wonderful surprise of a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate upon our return to the room later that night! When first walking into our room, we were totally taken aback by the beauty of it. It was simultaneously modern and inviting. The hardwood floors were beautiful and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've had the pleasure of sleeping in. The TV was HUGE, which was a big plus for my husband and I loved the oversized chair and ottoman in the corner. The bathroom was immaculate. We loved the shower and size and the large amount of counter space for all your stuff!! We checked in on Friday, but our anniversary was on Saturday. After a full day of shopping and checking out Balboa Park, we returned to the hotel to see what kind of restaurant recommendations the front desk could offer us. Fortunately, David was working again and him and another helpful person recommended many restaurants which catered our every need (seafood, on 5th, patio seating). We decided on Asti for a nice italian dinner and David was able to make us reservations for that night. The dinner was amazing and our server had a little tip off that it was our anniversary. After dinner, we headed up for a relaxing nightcap at the rooftop bar for wonderful views of the city and great conversation. We are thoroughly pleased with our stay at the Hotel Indigo.

Indigo is an very upscale version of the funky South Beach hotels -- very bright colors and open environment, but much cleaner and more comfortable than South Beach. Room is good size, plenty of window, very comfortable bed, spotless bathroom. Hotel is quiet (or soundproof, either way works). Staff is pleasant, and efficient, if not too friendly. Downstairs/lobby bar/restaurant is adequate. Only had breakfast there Saturday morning. It was \"okay\". Bartender serving it was pleasant. Yes. Valet parking is expensive. But, this is San Diego, and this is downtown. Deal with it. Fast WiFi available throughout the hotel. Superb property location. 5th & 6th Avenues are the downtown hot spots and the hotel is 4 blocks away, bay is about 12 blocks as is Little Italy. Easy walk. Neighborhood has lots of homeless, but they are not obtrusive nor threatening. Do not be intimidated walking to or from the hotel at night. San Diego's urban development is moving east. The restaurants & bars & clubs are expanding past 6th to 7th. It will only get better for the Indigo as the area around is built up and redeveloped. PS-1: Choose a restaurant on 5th Avenue but be not put off by the mobs of people. There are plenty of restaurants to get seated at, even on Saturday night. PS-2: Pay attention the drink prices if you go into one of the clubs. I paid over $20 for 2 glasses of wine at one. That's more ridiculous than the lobby bar in the Marriotts. Not so great stuff about the Indigo (hence my 4 stars): 1. Be prepared to wait for your car if you valet park. Valet car recovery is very very slow. 2. INEXCUSABLE for this hotel. The wonderful bar on the 9th floor is a great spot to just sit or meet. Good view. It has a great happy hour. BUT, it serves you wine and drinks in cheap little half sized PLASTIC cups! It's like getting a beer at a beach bar! I thought at first there was some sort of municipal restriction on glass containers on rooftops in San Diego, but, the other hotels have rooftop bars and serve drinks in real glass! What an amateur thing for the Indigo to do. Imagine your delightful Pinot Griggio served in a plastic cup! Talk about popping a bubble. How romantic! Ah! Nothing like the taste of plastic on a warm San Diego evening! Glad I didn't order champagne. Those are small (but notable) gripes. The hotel, as a hotel -- place to stay and sleep -- is first class.

FLOOR: Laminate wood with an area rug. BED: Very comfortable, inbetween firm and soft. Pillows are very soft and fluffy. Gigi liked to hide under the bed so make sure you check under the beds for lost items. BATHROOM: Spacious with a Large shower (no tub). 1 sink with plenty of counter space.

The moment Curtis took over; from planning the menu to our venue requirements he was professional and very helpful. I have to say it was the easiest meeting/event I have ever planned with everything running smoothly. Curtis made sure that prior to our event all of our questions were answered and any issues taken care of (He even offered the restaurant Phi as a backup contingency plan, had the weather turned too cold for an outside event). The day of the event we arrived greeted by the valet guys to help us unload our car and take everything to our meeting location. I must say the valet guys are the \"Silent Saviors\" willing to help out in any way with running back and forth from the car to the event space making sure we had everything we needed without letting us lift a finger and all with a smile and expecting nothing in return. I didn't get his name but Kudos to the valet guy who helped us all night; someone needs to give him a raise! Everything else from that point on ran smoothly, from setting up the space on-time to having the microphone arrive just in time for the awards ceremony....Curtis made sure to check on the event throughout the night until the very end. The food was excellent; we opted to do heavy appetizer stations instead of a full plated menu; but I can only imagine what the full menu would be like if the appetizers were fantastic! The event staffs were friendly and helpful; must say whoever is the hotel manager must be doing a good job because it showed throughout the hotel and the staff's demeanor, not one bad apple in the bunch!

The hotel location is a bit tricky, just on the borderline. If you walk towards the Gaslamp Quarter (5th street) or the convention centre, specially using the Market Street, there are restaurants, shops and people walking by at almost all the times. But if you walk on the other direction, then it just feels unsafe (it is not as bad as next to the bus station on the other side of town), but you look over your shoulder a couple of times. So if you are a woman and travelling alone, be aware of your surrounding in San Diego. Still it is walking distance from the convention centre and marina and a very good hotel.

We brought our dog with us, which I really hesitated over because although hotels may say that they are \"dog-friendly\", often they are just \"dog-tolerant\". There are usually all sorts of rules and regulations, and fees, and it's just a bit stressful. Hotel Indigo is really different - they genuinely welcome dogs. No fees, no restrictions, and they actually looked happy to see our dog at check in! There is a little park a block away right in front of Petco Park where dogs run off leash. Also, the hotel obviously goes to great pains to ensure that the hotel does not feel doggy - it is immaculate, and very stylish. For once, our dog actually enjoyed her weekend away too. The area is brilliant and the hotel could not be more convenient for the many bars and restaurants. Lastly, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful -probably the best service we have had at a hotel for a while.

Many others have praised its virtues as a modern boutique hotel, so I will focus on a few other things. The location is pretty good, just far enough from the busy areas of the Gas Lamp to afford a quieter experience but also great for walking into the heart of it all. The not so good: For a 4 Star hotel (purported) the quality of some of the basics was rather poor. Bathroom towels for example were cheap barely above Motel 6 standards for thin and scratchy. Not to nit pick, but for a hotel like this with so much style this just stood out as really bad. One of our rooms actually had a card and gift for another guest. We let the front dest know, and they sent someone up to get the items. This shows lack of care from the front desk staff in assigning rooms. I would be careful of making special requests or booking for someone with the intent of providing additional personal attention. My room had two problems. One, in the middle of the night the bathroom fan would make strange noises when off. A sporadic clicking sound. The bathroom door was not seated correctly on it's tight hinges and caused the door to scream very loudly when open or closed. Very disrupting and could actually be heard in the next room. This may be minor, and probably corrected by a phone call if it was noticed in the middle of the night. Room-service was poor at best. I ordered breakfast and it arrived promptly, but cold bland, and completely lacking in attention to match that of the hotel. Other small things show a lack of attention to detail. It seems like so much time at that hotel was spent on the design and creating this \"atmosphere\" that they forgot to first be a hotel.

From my hotel window, I could see clearly into Petco Park. A walk to the bars was less than 5 minutes, yet it was far enough so that I was never dodging night owls when I stepped outside. There was also a great coffee shop (pet friendly too!) called Java Jones that was less than a block away. When I walked in, I was greeted by one of the the pleasant staff members behind the counter. The hotel itself is beautiful. The contemporary decor - with its greens, blues, beige and orange - gives the hotel a comfortable yet upscale feeling. In the front lobby there was a waterfall display, couches where I lounged as I waited for my friends, a full bar with great original cocktails, and computers so I could check my email for free. I heard that they have live music at the hotel on certain nights and offer happy hour specials too. The rooms itself were clean and bright with hardwood floors. It's a huge plus that the hotel is pet friendly! The bed was nice, big shower w/ a wooden stool, Aveda bath products, flat screen TV, an iHome alarm clock so I could plug in my iPod, and a Keurig coffee maker. The Keurig is such a nice touch! An added bonus was also the free wifi in the hotel room. If I ever needed to go for a quick run on the treadmill, there was a gym with nice, new equipment and also an awesome outdoor patio with bar and fire pits. Honestly, I never spent more than 20 minutes in the gym, but spent all night at the outdoor bar/patio. I must say that the best part about the hotel is the staff. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. The last time, I brought my dog and the staff was so kind to him! They had water bowls for him outside and doggie treats for him to munch on. It was the first time that he had traveled away from home and apparently he wasn't keen on staying in the room alone. While I was out at Del Mar, I got a call from the front desk manager saying that his barking was causing our neighbor to file a noise complaint. With my permission, the front desk manager took my pooch out of the room and let him stay down at the front desk until I returned five hours later! He was as happy as a clam there! I'm not trying to advertise dogsitting services because the hotel doesn't offer it, but the fact that they went out of their way to calm him and their other guests truly made me and my dog feel special!

The food was great in the restaurant. The menu isn't huge, but everything we tried was excellent. We also enjoyed the roof top lounge with a view of the ballpark. I hope the manager reads these reviews so he can give Tye and the rest of the staff a pat on the back for making our stay an enjoyable one.

Having recently stayed at some of the Indigo's local competitors, I wouldn't be so quick to pick this property in the future over the others. The hotel is exceedingly well decorated in a trendy style that is comfortable despite its chic appearance. It's kind of like staying in a W Hotel without the attitude that sometimes accompanies a W stay. However, this hotel's management would do well to study some of what W Hotels do well in terms of offering friendly and personalized service. Parking is a real pain point. Because of the location immediately in front of Petco Park stadium and next to the Gaslamp quarter, street parking is often not an option. Meters run Mon-Sat until 6 pm and only allow 2-hour maximum stay. Garages and pay lots are available nearby but are no great bargain. This forces one to consider the $32 a night valet service. Unfortunately $32 doesn't buy very much in the service. I called down to the valet station to have my car pulled up (no direct line, must go through the Hotel operator) and didn't get an answer either time. The 2nd time this happened I complained to the front desk who promised to alert the valet to pull up my car. I came downstairs 10 minutes later and still waited 15 minutes for my car when I was in an awful hurry to get to a wedding. The valet manager was very unconvincing when he apologized and said that they were very busy - I was one of 2 people waiting for my car during this period. I ended up having that night's parking comped by the front desk manager. I also learned that the hotel uses an outside vendor for the parking service. I strongly recommend that they dump this vendor. The Phi Lounge on the 9th floor balcony is a beautiful spot with a great view into Petco Park stadium. Unfortunately the lounge was staffed by a single unsmiling drone bartender who do never left the back of the bar to take orders and needed me to repeat my order three times. The food in the lobby bar/lounge is very good - especially the sweet potato fries and sliders. The service was also marginally better here, possibly because it's in view of the front desk managers. The rooms are very comfortable and well insulated against outdoor noise. Having said that, the walls are a little thin and the echo of high heels from the 3 women staying in the next room on the parquet wood floor was annoying. Since I stayed on the top floor, I don't know if overhead noise from the wood floor is an issue for downstairs neighbors. The bathrooms are nicely decorated with a spacious shower. However, water pressure is a problem at times. I reported this to management and within 5 minutes an engineer visited my room and then went to reset a pump. This gave me enough pressure to shower, but I wouldn't ever recommend this hotel to someone who likes a good strong shower. There is no fridge in the rooms of any kind, however there are excellent Keurig one-cup coffee makers and safes in the room's closet. Check your bill really carefully upon checkout because mine still contained the parking charge for the night that was to have been comped. The bill was adjusted but the manager should have really taken care of that when he originally promised. Additionally, I was charged for a $5 water bottle placed in the room that I never touched. Overall, I'd call this hotel a 3-star hotel masquerading as a 4-star hotel. For a few dollars more a night, I'd prefer to stay at the W and be pampered a little.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Davenport, Iowa", "Title": "\u201c\"Hotel I want to INDIGO again!\"\u201d", "Author": "alwyzbz1", "ReviewID": "UR77895851", "Content": "We went to San Diego for the International Fire Fighter Convention and stayed at Hotel Indigo.

She ran through them and down the street crossing two major throughfares to PETCO stadium park. The Dieter ran after her. He finally caught up with her in a Seven-Eleven convenience store and brought her back to the hotel. He locked her up in a sales office however she managed to open THAT door a couple of times before I arrived. Needless to say, I was amazed and astonished that: 1. She opened the door to my room. Now anyone that knows Angel knows that she can open my doors at home. However, didn't THINK that she could manage a commercial hotel room door! 2. She got into the elevator and was able to make it downstairs. The front desk clerks watched the security video tape and said that she went straight to the elevator banks and waited until the doors opened. The big question is: HOW DID SHE HIT THE DOWN BUTTON??? 3. Angel and I had just gone to Petco Stadium that morning for a walk and had stopped in the 7-11 store to get a drink. Guess she thought I was still there! 4. Last but certainly not least, she managed NOT to get run over in busy San Diego traffic! She has become quite the sensation around here at Hotel Indigo... I'm just hoping to get her back to Colorado in one piece.

I had left an expensive watch on the bed upon checkout and discovered it was missing half a day later. They were too busy to check up on housekeeing the entire afternoon, but at night, one of the guys called me up to say they had located it and that I can pick it up anytime. I have to say, in my mind, I was ready to let the watch go, hoping it will benefit someone's useful life (sarcastically speaking), but was delightfully surprised to have found that housekeeping acted responsibly and did the right thing.

Having graduated from San Diego State, I knew Gaslamp was where I wanted to be. Also, there were four scheduled Padre home games during our stay from Friday 5/28/2010 through Monday 5/31/2010 so the hotel had to be walking distance from the stadium making this hotel ideal. When making our room reservations, I happened to speak with the front desk supervisor. Dieter, was very helpful and his age (around my 26) made his suggestions perfect for a great night out. Upon arriving, the curb service was great with our bags and our dog. Among all the great Bell serviceman, Sergio was the most notable. He greeted our dog daily with the affection only dog lovers provide. Although I'm not as influenced by dog treats as my bulldog, Sergios friendliness quickly provided a sense of comfort as if we were guests at his own home. He even informed me of great places for doggy business within and around the hotel. Our rooms were amazing! The view of PETCO Park from the window was so perfect that I didn't have to go to the stadium to watch any games. Both rooms reserved had the same view of the stadium, were comfortably furnished with two queen beds, and side by side on the 8th floor. Conveniently located just below the 9th floor patio where we were informed a section of grass was available for dog business. Monica, also of the front desk, made it effortless catching a cab every time one was needed. She was also very friendly with conversation while waiting for the rest of the group to make it down to the lobby. Monica was also very helpful recommending what to order for room service. The hotel was perfect! No overwhelming trendy design. Close enough to walk to the scene but far enough to be away. Aside from the water bowl out front, the hotel was maintained so clean that you would not know it was dog friendly. From check-in to check-out, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff made our stay seem effortless.

There\u2019s a lot in the hotel\u2019s literature about how \u201cchic\u201d, \u201csophisticated\u201d and \u201cin\u201d it is, and although my own preference would be for less self-conscious glorification of trendiness, it is a beautifully decorated hotel with fresh bright linens on the beds, interesting light fixtures and paint, and large and gorgeous bathrooms. Still on the positives, we ate breakfast in the Phi restaurant twice and were favorably impressed with the service. On the other hand, staff training in some other areas needs some work. I found the front desk staff only minimally polite, a bit supercilious, even. This is unfortunate, since first impressions count for a lot and I want to feel that if I have to talk to the front desk staff about a problem, that they will be motivated to put it right. But after all, this is just my subjective impression and maybe some guests prefer a more aloof demeanor than I do. More seriously, our rooms were not thoroughly cleaned. For example, when we arrived in the room I sat down in the armchair and moved the footstool a few inches. What should I see but a wadded up used Kleenex on the floor that the housekeeping staff had missed? Yuck. Another housekeeping problem: the rooms had beautiful high-end coffee makers, but neither of our two rooms had a complete set of coffee making materials the first morning we woke up in the hotel. We had coffee in one room, but had to raid the coffee tray in the kids' room next door to get cream and sugar for my husband, who doesn't like black coffee. That was okay I suppose, since we had two rooms and could combine the supplies, although we would expect better in this class of hotel. But then after the housekeeping staff had serviced the rooms later that day, we found they had not cleaned the coffee maker or the cups, nor had they replenished the coffee, cream, or sugar in either room. So we weren\u2019t able to use the coffee maker the second morning we were in the hotel. Housekeeping also didn't wash or replace the glasses we had used. Again, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world, but this is not a low-budget hotel and I expected better service for what we paid. This isn't a criticism, more an observation: families with young children do not appear to be a demographic that this hotel is targeting. We noted that while dogs were welcome in the restaurant, it didn't have a children's menu. We managed to find things on the menu everyone in our family could eat at breakfast, since our kids are old enough to do justice to adult portions and choices. But a few years ago nothing on the restaurant's menu would have been appealing to them, especially for lunch and dinner. All in all, this is an interesting hotel and it may be a great choice for some people.

When it comes to toiletries, I don't know if the hotel is cheap or what, but you will come up short with towels, soap and such. Perhaps this is something that most hotels don't seem to get, but if you have TWO people staying in a room, it would be nice to provide for TWO. Also, it would be nice if they took time to clean the shower. The beds are not the most comfortable. However, this is relative. In summary, it's not the worst hotel. I would not say that. But, to claim to be a four-star hotel is a stretch. It takes more than pretty sheets and curtains. While four-star is NOT five-star, it does provide service offerings.

Too loud for the setting, didn't fit the hotel mood or style. Great Mac's in the lobby for your use, free. Did I mention the price? Hundreds less than what I have paid for a comparable hotel.

The huge murals of extreme close-ups of plants should make you feel like an aphid trapped in a Venus flytrap, but they add a sense of calm instead. The baseball stadium nearby should make it feel hot-dogs-and-beer-y, but it's quite elegant. Our room was a corner room by the vending area, and we could hear the ice machine once at 4 in the morning, but beside that I would have thought we were the only people in the hotel (not likely on a busy Friday night!) The view was not of the stadium, which I understand some rooms face. We didn't mind at all, though, because we weren't there for the view. We appreciated the convenience of being able to walk all the places we wanted to go, and having a really nice home base to return to afterwards. The best way I can describe it is to look at the Cypress Hotel in Cupertino and the Hyatt at Olive 8 in Seattle. It's got the vibe of the Cypress and the look of the Hyatt.

I tried out the brand new Hotel Indigo in San Diego over Halloween weekend for my annual \"girls trip\" with my friends from college. We all flew in from different cities, and one of my friends arrived several hours before me. I called the hotel and notified them that her flight would be getting in before me and asked if she would be allowed to check in - even though the reservation was in my name. The took all of her information and greeted her with open arms. When the rest of us arrived, we were greeted by name (how did they know it was us?) by saying \"You must be the girls from Georgia and Wisconsin!\" WOW! We got up to our room and it was beautiful! Rich full color, hardwood floors, large LCD plasma tv (not that we ever turned it on), and the best part of it all - Aveda bath products! (the same stuff I actually use at home!) While reading a little about the hotel in the in-room info, this hotel is the first LEED certified hotel for it's brand. They have so many great eco-friendly ammenities: recycling in the room, keep your sheets and towel program if you don't need them washed every day, hardwood floors for better air quality and many, many more things. They have a great 9th floor outdoor Phi Terrace bar where you can oversee San Diego harbor and the Gas Lamp district. It has a great environment embracing all of the elements of nature: fire with great fire pits, water with a beautiful reflecting pool, earth with incredible stone work and air with the open air terrace. They also have a wonderful restaurant and bar on the first floor that has large full-wall windows that open up - so you can experience the wonderful San Diego weather! Another thing that wins my heart over - they are pet-friendly! There were many, many people with dogs in the hotel and the dogs are welcomed just as if they are a member of the family. They have a canine cocktail hour with happy hour specials for the two-legged guests and free dog cookies and bowls of water for the four-legged guests! I've never seen such happy pooches! What can I say about the service? EVERY employee (or inbassadors as they are called) greeted us with warm 'welcome homes' every time we walked in, smiled, answered any questions we had, gave excellent recommendations of things to do in town and were genuine service providors! KUDOS to this team!! My favorite part of the entire trip would have to be Sandie - the Hotel Indigo mascot. She is a rescued dog from a local shelter who makes her home at Hotel Indigo.

This hotel has only been open 6 days so anything I say could be premature. That being said, here I go with my opinions. 1. Staff is eager and energetic, yet somehow immature and unseasoned. 2. Rooms are different. Faux wood floors make for noisy atmosphere. Area rug covers small area near window. 3. 9th Floor Bar is lovely, as is the meditation deck and exercise areas, also on the 9th Floor. 4. I am a Priority Club GOLD member, but no upgrade or perks. 5. Valet parking is OUTRAGEOUS at $32 a day! Over the top. 6. \"Easy chair\" in room is a large wing back and among THE most uncomfortable ever. What's the point in that? 7. Nice big comfortable beds with upgraded bedding. 40\" Flat Screen TV's. 8. Big \"walk-in\" shower with useless wooden stool and European hand-held shower. I took the stool out as I don't normally sit for my shower. 9. Upscale Aveda toiletries. Nice touch. 10. Oddly, with all the thought into the room design, there are few choices to place baggage. 11. Odd furnishings and decor, including naugahyde (sp?) foot stool and weird and unappealing wall paper/painting. 12. Interesting, limited and creative room service menu that may not appeal to all. Prices are decent, however, so we'll see what they deliver. In summation, a clean, new hotel property with little to recommend it above the more luxe area hotels (Omni & Marriott). Unless the rooms are very competitive and you can park off-site and avoid the excessive fee, I can't recommend it highly.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torrance, California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful new boutique hotel across from Petco Park\u201d", "Author": "dinkopal", "ReviewID": "UR35193766", "Content": "We got lucky and was overbooked at the Se San Diego so they sent us to Hotel Indigo. We loved it! From the valets to the desk staff, everyone was genuinely pleasant and friendly. We had expected the valet charge of $32 which was fine. Especially since we there when the Padres were playing plus there was a big street party down the street so the parking was pretty pricey everywhere. The internet was free which was nice. This is also a green hotel which is important to me. The room were in was on the ninth floor right next to the elevators and the bar. But our room was very quiet and comfortable. Loved the hardwood floors, big comfy bed, flat screen tv and attractive large bathroom. My husband loved the roomy glass shower that had a bamboo stool in it that you could just sit down and let the hot water from the shower relax you. There is a meditation room just outside of the fitness room that is relaxing although not very quiet as this is in downtown San Diego. The fitness room was well equipped. The outside bar on the ninth floor has a wonderful view of Petco park which is just over the next block. It was nice to have a drink outside and watch the game from afar while sitting next to a gas fire. The only setback is that this hotel does not have a swimming pool but they do have what they call a \"reflection pool\" in the bar area. You can't swim it but you can sit next to it and run your fingers in the cool water and reflect I guess. We really enjoyed our one night stay at Hotel Indigo on their 6th day of business!

We booked a black box 4* via Hotwire in the hostoric center (Gaslamp district) and got into this new hotel (4 days open) for 127USD + taxes. In general very friendly staff. Well sized rooms, etc. I am using the WIFI now (I think its free). They have a spectacular terrace on the 9th floor and you can see into the Ballpark of the San Diego Padres (and we just saw the fireworks). The fitness rooms seems to be above average as well (They even had complimentary power bars and fruits - remains to be seen if they keep this). Now a few smaller drawbacks. -The valet parking is 32+tax+tips. So if you are, like I am, not a big fan of valet parking you can park for 15 bucks one block away (plenty of parking around here). - I went to the bar and ordered a glass of wine to take it to the room. No prices on the bar list (pretty common, nevertheless I don't like it) so the glass turned out to cost 10 dollar + tax+tip. The real problem was that the glass was barely wet. The lady serving at the bar (very unfriendly) couldn't quite cope with the busy evening and she disappeared in a hurry so I couldn't complain. Well, I asked another staff and he told me they typically put 6oz - I got probably half of that (in a designer glass that looks like a shrunken whisky glass, big minus too).
