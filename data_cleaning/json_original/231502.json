Our room was excellent and as we were travelling with our two granchildren we had a double room with the girls having their own space with sliding doors between the two rooms. The room was very clean and comfortable and quiet being at the back of the hotel. We had breakfast on two of the mornings at 11 euros each adult and 11 euros for the two girls.There was a very good choice of different foods from cereal and fruit to muffins and croissant. All the staff were helpful and friendly particularly the two bar staff. The situation of the hotel was ideal with the metro and bus stop right outside.

We took a taxi from the airport which cost 26 euros which I did not consider expensive. On arrival at the hotel we asked for a quiet room with twin beds, we were given room 655 which was spacious and spotlessly clean. Miguel the receptionist gave us a few tips on safety in the town and was very informative and helpful, we asked him a number of times about where things were and was given good advise. The hotel is perfectly placed for exploring the city as the tour buses and local buses have stops only a few minutes walk away. The tour buses are 24 euros and are fun way to explore the city, it's best to get on one early before they get too busy, they run til fairly late so it's good to go around the city as night falls the bull righ which is now a concert venue looks amazing lit up at night. Las Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk with lots of restaurants and bars off the side streets, some of these are a little bit seedy after dark so best to get a taxi or stick to the main roads where there always seemed to be a good police presence. We went by train from Sants station to Sitges which is beautiful with a lovely beach and excellent restaurants. A return ticked for an adult is 7.20 euros which is far cheaper than England the information office in the station have very helpful staff who speak good english. Breakfast in the hotel was good but very noisy at busy times and they did keep running out of cutlery. Overall a well placed hotel offering everything you need for a city break at a resonable price. I would use this hotel again and definately recommend it.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location\u201d", "Author": "Lynda G", "ReviewID": "UR128286028", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights recently and having done our homework (by reviewing the hotel on this site) we were already aware of the possibility of noise from the nightclub and asked to be located in a quiet room to the rear of the hotel. This was no problem, and we were allocated room 104 on the first floor and we had no problems at all sleeping as we heard nothing at all! The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. We tried the hotel breakfast on the first morning and I would agree that it is quite pricey (11 euros) if you do not eat much at breakfast time. There are numerous cafe's across the road selling coffee and fresh orange juice and fresh pastries or filled croissants and baguettes for a fraction of the price if a smaller meal is all you require. We travelled to the hotel via the airport bus which takes you to the centre of Barcelona (place Catalunya) and costs just over 5 euros per person and takes around half an hour. From there take the metro to Paral lel which is literally right outside the hotel. A 10 journey ticket costs just over 9 euros and can be used by more than one person (there were 4 of us and we all used the same ticket, which can also be used on the local buses). The hotel is ideally placed for walking to the port or the ramblas and we had no problems walking back to the hotel later in the evening. Like any other big city it's just a case of taking care, and being aware of what's going on around you.

I have 2 girls and a boy (ages respectively are 16, 12 and 9). I think this will help people when planning especially those with children. What can I say, the Tryp Apollo was awesome. I had one little incident on my departure where the skinny woman at the front desk was rude (she took someone in front of me after seeing I was clearly there before the other woman who happened to be a native, I guess). Either way, I won't let that little incident ruin anything especially since the other gentleman (sorry I can't recall is name, but he's dark haired, with a mustache and a small beard and about 5' 5\" with somewhat of a wave pattern in his hair) took good care of me and sent me on my way. Sorry, I digress :), but overall the Hotel was nicely located, easy access to the tour buses, which you can pay for in the hotel so you don't have to stand on line when you reach the tour bus (Barcelona City Tours, not Tourestic (sp)) location which is a few blocks away by the Barcelona Port, a few blocks up to La Rambla (which my kids loved), Metro L2 and Fenicular (sp) to Parc Montjuic are litterally right outside the door. There are a few eateries (cafeterias and restaurants right there as well). So location gets all thumbs up. Just be careful if you eat at Frederia (sp again, sorry), but it's like a block and a half to 2 blocks to the right of the hotel on the left-hand side. Food was good but they charged me 50 euros for paella. Guy said he didn't understand my order (yeah right, i think that's a trick to make more money from tourist). I'll leave a tip on how to order if you go there later on. Moving on, the hotel itself was clean and reasonably priced. Staff, overall was helpful (first day we got great directions, and area maps, and was told to watch our belongings). We knew that already but I was happy they told us anyway. We also got a good deal on the buffet which is a good option if you don't want the fuss with getting up and going out for breakfast with the kids daily. We had to microwave everything (but we found warm food is the norm in Barcelona so didn't find that odd, plus my kids like their eggs well done and their bacon). They had a nice assortment and their croissants were very tasty along with the fresh fruit and espresso :) Room was clean and kids loved the family room set up. We all had our own beds and they slept comfortably. They write on the mirror to welcome you and our room was themed with the Chimpmunks (cute). We also had a bidet (my son got a kick out of it and we all used it at least once, lol). Cleaning staff was very nice and accommodating. When we needed more towels they were delivered promptly and when they cleaned up they remembered to leave us what we needed daily. I guess the hotels don't really restock supplies, like shampoo and lotion unless requested. I thought that was odd when we first arrived but saw it was the same in Barcelona as what we experienced in Madrid. Food in the hotel is probably pricey for certain items but others are reasonable (such as the buffet). I paid 20 euros for plain vanilla helado for 4 people (that's a little much considering how much you can get it for up the block or at La Rambla). Not worth it! Just take the walk :) We used the mini bar to add coke to ours to make floats (coke from mini bar was 2 euros and agua con gas was 1.5 euro; again not bad but you can get it cheaper if you just walk up the block). So in summary, and sorry about being all over the place with this review, it was a great experience and I'd definitely go back to Tryp and because of this experience will consider visiting some of their other locations in the future.

This was fine for us as we were there to see the city and spent little time in the room. Our room was fairly low in the building and on the corner, one side facing Avinguid Paral-lel. Av. Paral-lel is a very busy street and street noise was a little bit of a problem as we were there over a weekend. The location was good but not great. To walk over to the port or to La Rambla it was at least 15 to 20 minutes which got a little old after three days. There is a Metro stop on the same block as the hotel. The room was nicely cleaned by the maid service everyday. The front desk staff all spoke English very well but some were not as helpful as they could have been. I had to go to the desk three times to get one problem resolved. On the other hand, we had the door handle on the bathroom break and maintenance came and repaired it right away. So I would say service was mixed. The breakfast room was very large and the variety of food was very good. The hotel had several large groups of students staying there at the time and the breakfast room could get crowded but the wait was not long.

Because we were only going to be in the city for approximately 24 hours we knew our focus would be on making sure we were close to all the action so we could hit the town running and of course we wanted to be close to the port. We didn't need anything fancy. After reading the Trip Advisor reviews, most thought the location was perfect especially if you are heading on a cruise and for the money it seemed a good value. When we arrived the staff was very friendly and offered restaurant suggestions for dinner in Port Olympia which was a short cab ride away. The hotel itself is very dated. It's no lap of luxury for sure. It's very basic and the rooms followed suit. They were on the small side and our double bed was literally two twin beds pushed together. Luckily for us it was only a one night stay so it worked well. We didn't spend much time in our room. We were within walking distance of just about everything. We spent the day walking around La Rambla and Port Olympia at night. Breakfast wasn't included with our room but we found a great little cafe close by and grabbed some food the next morning. We caught a cab to the port which was less than 10 minutes away. If you are looking for just a comfortable, clean place to rest your head then the Tryp Apolo isn't a bad option. You can't beat the location.

Breakfast was reasonably priced (EUR11 per day) but a little manic at times, but this was expected during the valentines period.

Best of all were the staff. They were all so pleasant, helpfull and nearly always a smile. Astrid, Ryan Ford and Jorge were really helpful. Having travelled many places in the world and backpacked with no problems ever I get my purse stolen on the beach in Barcelona. I never saw who it was but plain clothes police and a witness saw it and the person dropped my rucksack, but had taken my purse (wallet) and mobile phone in it before running off.. We were asked to go the police station near the hotel and make a statement which we did.The police on the beach were very apologetic about what happened. The police station was helpful and there was a freephone to get hold of the credit card companies and cancel. The thieves got my mobile phone as well and that was cancelled as well with the help of the staff at the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for them, The police station was busy with people who were in the same position as myself so even though you are warned be very very careful. The hotel has safes that are free in the rooms and that is fantastic.Our passports etc. were safe all day we were out. The thieving happened the day we were to return home and were on the beach staring at the sea and that is one of the places they get you. I was warned to be aware but took my eye off the ball. We did not query at the hotel if there was somewhere to leave our passports etc. after vacating a room. Our luggage was locked in a room by the porter and we were given a claim check. Maybe there was somewhere safe to leave our valuables during the day as our flight was an evening one. Our deal included breakfast and it was a really good one with a good variety of foods and presentation. The lobby is not very exciting quite large and austere, but that could be improved upon in time. Most important were the helpful members of staff we met.

If I had to pick any sort of negatives for our own personal wants and needs then it would be the lack of English channel on TV (one channel, BBC World News). Im used to dated decor on my European travels but a worn out toilet seat was a bit much even my my standards. We had a room overlooking the main road, being a young couple who are partial to a bit of noise and a bit of people watching this was great for us, noise was only ever apparent when sirens went past however. On our last night we fell upon a parade going directly down the road outside of our hotel so we had some great views of that. Parrel-lel Metro station is just outside the reception. I suggest you get the T-10 ticket, which is 10 journeys for just 9.25 Euro which can be used by you and your partner, otherwise you will pay up to 2 Euro for a single journey. We used three T-10 tickets but connection trains do not use up a journey as you are already within a station, this was great as we travelled everywhere via metro. La Rambla is across the road and down a small side street for roughly 3 blocks, we ventured it twice but never ate or drank on the strip cos prices were steep as expected, although the fruit juices in the market were a welcome morning after the night before refreshment. Luckily my partner speaks fluent Spanish and having friends that have lived here we were able to locate recommended restaurants. The Gracia area of the city flaunts the largest and highest quality of places to eat, I recommend 'Taller de Tapas' (get metro to Passeig de Gracia) which is on the same train line as the hotel metro station and was alos in the New York Times for its award winning food. Barceloneta is the beach front area, its a 15 minute walk away, with a work through Port Vell and then afterwards to Port Olimpica it was one of the enjoyable walks iv'e ever experience. One of my regrets was not getting the one of the bikes that are located throughout the city (and outside hotel) where you can just pop off and then park it up in the nearest bike rank to your desired destination, this is very popular amongst locals.

I\u2019m sorry to say Tryp Apolo that you must clinging on to your 4* rating by the skin of your teeth because this hotel needs some serious investment and a major revamp to keep the 4* status and be dragged into 2012! We stayed in a standard double room so I can\u2019t comment on the Superior rooms, Fitness rooms or suites etc\u2026. I like Tryp/Sol hotels for two reasons, 1, You always get a fridge in the room (to chill your cheap supermarket beers prior to heading out on a night, The Condis supermarket is turn right out of the hotel then 2 main streets up then turn right approx 2 mins walk open until 9.30pm) 2, The bathrooms are spotless and really clean, However, Staying at the Apolo you do get the fridge but not the latter I\u2019m afraid as the bathroom was extremely shabby, discoloured grout, bath plug not attached to the chain, cracked tiles and all the stainless steel fittings have been worn through to expose the brass underneath! Panelled dark wood all over the room feels very 70\u2019s indeed, Only 2 english channels on the TV, BBC world news and Russia today, Unless you can get this hotel at a cracking price i.e. No more than \u00a365 per night RO then I would seriously look at a 3* elsewhere for similar money!! We stayed RO basis so I couldn\u2019t comment on the Breakfast or evening meal dining experience, Although, we did eat in a couple of the local bar restaurants right opposite the hotel, The Bar El Rincon Del Artista and the Fashion restaurant, Which were both a very pleasant experience, decent food at a good price. As for breakfast save your money as any caf\u00e9 in the vicinity does coffee & croissant for \u20ac2euros. Also, Save you taxi fares as the hotel is in a great location for La rambla/City centre approx 10 mins walk straight down the road opposite the hotel, Carrer Nou de la Rambla, It\u2019s also really safe walking back late at night as the street is a hub of activity with bars/cafes/supermarkets all open late and there is also a police headquarters on the street, Metro stop (Parallel) right outside the hotel for ease of getting around to see the sights of Barcelona and one of the lines actually takes you direct to Sagrada Familia.

As soon as we checked in, the receptionist recommended us to take advantage of the special breakfast offer: just \u00a310/person/day instead of \u00a320. We passed, and did a good thing: there are lots of restaurants in the neighbourhood where you can get much better value (full English breakfast for 5 euro or coffee and croissant or toast for 2 euro). We stayed in a double room on the third floor. The bedding and towels were changed daily, but the room was never dusted or vacuumed for the duration of our stay (my husband even left me a love message on the window the day we arrived - the dust was that thick - and it was still there when we checked out). On the third day of our stay, the electricity suddently went off. When we went to enquire, we saw a notice in the hall next to the elevator door saying there is maintenance work being done, but we were not warned in advance. Do not recommend the rooms facing the main road since they can be very noisy in the early hours of the day. Also, the AC unit was noisy and not very effective. On the bright side, there was everything you could need in the bathroom-from toothbrush to shoe shine. The location is excellent - walking distance to La Rambla, Gothic Quarter, Magic Fountain and the beach. The tube station is right outside the hotel. Very easy to get to the hotel to and from the airport.

However, those fears were unfounded. The location is very convenient and the accommodations are spacious. Very easy to get to Montjuic and to Las Ramblas. The Para-lel Metro stop is literally just a few steps away. The furnishings were a bit worn in our room but everything was very clean. I suspect this hotel was built for the Olympics in 1992 (it's at the Metro stop for the funicular to Montjuic which is where the stadium is) and has not been updated since. We gave the housekeeper a Euro or two tip every day and the room was cleaned and made up very nicely every day. We requested an interior room because of some of the other reviews on this site. Noise was not a problem. They offer a breakfast with a discount if you buy it for your entire stay at check-in. The price for each breakfast was high (18 euros) if you don't buy it then for your stay. But after we declined the breakfast, the person at the check in desk offered ups an opportunity to sign up for the \"Mas\" affiliation program. With that you can get the breakfast for 9 euros per person per day for only the days you want it. We had the breakfast for two mornings. It was good and in my opinion worth the cost for a cafeteria type breakfast, Finally, as been noted in other reviews, some areas of el Raval are somewhat sketchy. But the area immediately around the hotel is fine, and if you walk along the Carrer Nou de la Rambla to get to La Rambla, I doubt you will have a problem there. There is a police station on that street. I live in New York City and I see el Raval as analogous to the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It is obviously an area they are trying to improve, although they may have been somewhat thwarted for now by the financial crisis in Spain. Check out the cat statue on Rambla del Raval if you get a chance.

Unfortunately, even at three our room was still not available. We were eventually allowed to enter our room at around 3:30pm. We were told that the family rooms in the Tryp are so big that it takes a cleaner over an hour to finish the room. This must be an industry record! The whole 2nd floor of the hotel had a terrible stench of stale cigarettes which, thankfully, did not continue into the room. The room was well decorated and at first sight seemed quite nice with no sign of the worn carpets or cracked tiles mentioned in other reviews. It really can't have taken an hour to clean because it's not that muh bigger than a standard room. We noticed that the cot we'd requested hadn't been placed in the room but that was quickly remidied with a call to recepetion (we tried housekeeping at first but the language barrier proved too great) During the evening some cracks did begin to appear in the furnisings; The door handle fell off the toilet door and a skirting board fell off but it wasn't really enough to put us off the room/hotel. The hotel offers a fabulous breakfast. Plenty of choice, plenty of room for all the guests and helpful staff. It's worth having the breakfast if you stay here.

This also included a special offer where breakfast was included (usually 10 Euros for an all you can eat buffet). The hotel is four star, very clean and tidy, friendly staff and nice rooms.

Something for even the fussiest of diners. The drinks were not as good: the coffee smelled like instant and there was only English Breakfast tea available. Orange juice was also offered.

We loved its location, and how it is literally next to the Paral.lel metro station, which was our main way to travel for sightseeing and also very cheap if you get a single ticket for 1.45 euros. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from La Rambla, where we ate most nights, which was great as we were away from the hustle and bustle but in easy walking distance. The street the hotel is on isn't the most appealing to the eye and doesnt look the safest, but not once did we feel threatened or scared. We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel as we felt it was a little overpriced, but there are plenty of cafes and fruit stalls around on the street so we didnt feel we missed out. I felt that the cleanliness and quality of the hotel was excellent - our room was a modest size, but a decent sized bed and bathroom. The entrance hall we thought was nice and clean! Our shower was a little temperamental, and our window was broken - but once we notified receptoin a handyman came within 5 minutes to fix it straightaway - very efficient! A negative side i would add would be the hotel gym isnt worth going to if you are intending to visit it often. I went there for a shower after we had checked out and were waiting to travel to the airport, and it was right around the back of the hotel, and not a very safe looking street. The gym was very dark and alot of building work was going on, and overall it seemed quite grotty. But overall we were very pleased with the hotel and thought it was good value for money. Some recommendations for eating: there is a square just off La Rambla called Plaza Real which has alot of great restaurants which are all decently priced. We ate twice by the beach which was more expensive, but good quality good, and worth trying out.

We arrived at midday and managed to check in straight away, despite a sign on the reception desk saying we wouldn't be able to until 2pm. Contrary to what a lot of others have said, the staff were helpful and friendly - we even had a little bit of banter with the porter! Our room was on the 6th floor, with a balcony overlooking the Avenue Parallel with its 6 lanes of traffic! Noisy, but once you closed the door you could barely hear a thing, so sleeping was no problem. The bed's were very comfy and the bathroom clean and perfectly adequate. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty, so we made the most of it and filled our bellies! There was a Metro station just outside the hotel, which was very handy for getting around the city - cheap, quick and also very clean compared to the London Underground. I had a great time in Barcelona and fell in love with the city. I have to say my highlight was seeing Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Familia, it was out of this world. You cannot go to Barcelona and not see this amazing building. Gaudi's influence is apparent all over the city, with several buildings evidently touched by his genius and of course, the Parc Guell. But I think my boyfriend would say his highlight was the Nou Camp, in the north of the city, which was also very impressive and well worth the visit!

Hotel: This hotel is faultless. The room was great, cleaned out early morning - 8/9am and the staff were friendly - they even gave us a packed breakfast on our 5am departure. Our room overlooked the main street. It's in a city location so you can't expect parks or mountains. It's fine. Breakfast is a very good buffet with a large choice of cooked food, cold meats and cheeses, fruits, drink, pasties and breads and an omelette station. Ours was included. Location: 10/15 minutes to the harbour leisure area and the start of La Rambla. Tapas bars and cafes just across the main road and a shortcut to La Rambla (Carrer Nou de la Rambla) with many interesting shops as an alternative walk one day. The hotel has a bar and \"snack\" bar attached which are reasonable. We didn't try the restaurant.. Getting there: Buses every few minutes right outside the airport terminal- 5euros. We needed Placa Espanya stop to get the metro for two stops. We missed our stop and got off at the University. We checked the map and walked - easily do-able with one case between us. Departing at 5.30am we got a cab from the rank outside - 27E. With four hours to kill before check in we left our bags, went to the harbour and took a harbour cruise (18E) for 90mins - great way to see the city from the near the shoreline. On the return I had a large beer for 3E on the boat which was great. Things to see; For us, the Cathedral (go inside), la Sagrada Familia - huge queues but worth just seeing it, la Boqueria food market displays are staggeringly beautiful, Gaudi's Casa Batlio (pay to go inside - it's worth it), La Pedrera and of course the street theatre in La Rambla night and day. We took the City Bus tour for 23E each but frankly it wasn't worth it - too quick to even take photographs.

The room is very clean, and despite some claims that the rooms were small, I found it to be no smaller than your usual hotel rooms, and if it were any bigger there would be a lot of wasted space!

However, a few weeks after our stay, I still feel strongly enough to write my first ever hotel review! Now for the hotel. The location of this place really isn't brilliant but, it's right next to the metro stop Para'lel and is a short walk to las Ramblas. However, it\u2019s pretty much in a red-light area so more than likely, you will encounter some ladies of the night on your way to the more popular areas of Barcelona if you don't pay attention to your route in the evening time. Although I must say didn't feel at all unsafe at any point, as I went out a for a late snack on my own one night. The hotel is deemed 4 stars but I think that decision was made quite a while ago! The hotel is in serious need of renovation. It has all the signs of former glory, but these signs, don't necessarily fit with the here and now. Its a little stuck in a time warp, but unfortunately picked one of the worst decades decor-wise to get stuck in! The reception area is large but not particularly welcoming with random displays and oddly placed furniture. I got chased by an over zealous security guard clearly with nothing better to do that inspect guests with heavy suitcases wanting to use the bathroom, to make sure they were indeed guests of the hotel! Lifts are a little scary and dimly lit. We took the stairs one day to avoid the rickety lifts only to find the stair wells were being used as a dumping ground for house-keeping supplies and extra bedroom furniture. Unfortunately, smoking laws mean that unless you smoke yourself and don't mind the smell, your room will most likely have the faint odour of stale cigarettes. So much so that we had to ask to change rooms. You actually have to request a non smoking-room, and even then, the faint smell lingers. Had to go to reception in person as no-one answered the phone. The bathroom was cleanish, but again with dated fixtures and fittings; free toiletries were a poor substitute. Also the carpets in the room and corridors were stained and there was rubbish from previous guests in the corners of our room and under the bed. Our double bed was in fact two pushed together, that's how we found all the rubbish as our beds moved during the night! Breakfast was extortionately priced, especially as there are much cheaper cafes and bars not far away. The Hesperia hotel was across the road and, having used the hotel before, we wished we were there, even though it had a lower star rating. On the whole not impressed with this hotel, it's worth searching for a good 3 star like the Hesperia rather than be let-down by this over priced four star. Even if the star rating was lowered I'm not sure it would be sufficient, the whole place left us feeling grubby and cheated. Our deal was done through Lastminute.com who clearly also don't veto their lists of hotels.

Having read some negative reviews before leaving, I was a bit worried, but had got a great deal on the hotel, and was very happy with it once we got there. We had a room on the 5th floor, and experienced no problems at all with noise from the traffic or anything else. The beds were extremely comfortable, and we slept great every night (probably aided by long days spent sightseeing). We didn\u2019t eat at the hotel, but surely the point of being in Barcelona is to be out there experiencing it! The hotel\u2019s location is also excellent if you are there for sightseeing. There is a metro station (Paral-lel) right outside the hotel, from which you can get to pretty much anywhere in a matter of minutes (Las Ramblas is 1 stop away). However we mostly walked; Las Ramblas is maybe 5 or 10 minutes down the road opposite. The Columbus monument is about 5/10 minutes straight down Paral-Lel. You can even walk to the Magic Fountains which is about a 20/30 minutes walk straight up Paral-Lel (the area at the top of Paral-Lel is breathtaking with the view up to the Museum). I have no doubt that there are nicer and better hotels in Barcelona than the Tryp (the Eixample district seemed to be the best area), but I also doubt you could get them for the rates of the Tryp.

The metro station is a few yards from the hotel door. We rented a scooter during our stay and could park it right outside the hotel entrance on marked scooter spots, for free.

The guy took the AC apart as we watched curiously and after a lot of dusting and cleaning the wires, he couldn't figure out what the problem was. We were sent to another room, which now had two twin sized beds. We were promised that we would be given a room with a queen sized bed as soon as one frees up. This second room had it lamp shades cracked, and there were lots of cracks on the bathroom tiles. The bathroom didn't have a shampoo that evening (thank God we carried one with us!). The following day, we were given a room with a queen bed. This room also had several things broken, the AC was painstakingly slow, but room service staff was very regular and we had an overall comfortable stay.

If you like more detail, read on... I just returned from Barcelona yesterday, having stayed 5 nights at the Tryp Apolo with my girlfriend and friends. Let's do the GOOD points first: * The hotel is, as advertised, geographically well located; near the heart of the city, the Ramblas etc etc. However, see also the BAD points of this review. * The reception desk staff were very helpful, polite and spoke excellent English. * The mini-bar drinks were reasonably priced; I hate paying \u00a35 for a water. Now the BAD stuff: * There is NO WAY this is a 4 star hotel by anyone's standards. The facilities on offer were as you would expect from a 2 or 3 star, but no more. There wasn't even coffee or tea making facilities (i.e. a kettle) in the room! * This may have been a smartly decorated place when it opened (I'm guessing about 7 years ago) but the carpets, walls, bathroom tiles etc are now well worn. ALL the fittings in our bathroom were rusty! * This is NOT a nice part of town. To get to/from the Ramblas, the Gothic Quarter etc you will have to walk down the street opposite, past strip joints etc. There's a peep show dead opposite the hotel. It's not too bad in the day but if you're not confident running the gauntlet of pimps and pushers at night, DO NOT stay here. And don't let any of the guidebooks try to tell you that this part of town was all 'cleaned up' a number of years back, in time for the Olympics; it wasn't. I have been to many major cities - I go out a good deal - but I felt uncomfortable and vulnerable when walking to/from this hotel after dark. I lost count of the number of pushers carrying and offering 'beer' for sale, which of course became 'hash', \u2018coke\u2019, \u2018charlie\u2019 as you got in speaking distance. There must have been 30 guys in just 100 metres (yards), 10 of which were within spitting distance of the front door\u2026 I know that pushers and other dodgy folk are not the responsibility of the hotel and realistically, there\u2019s noting the hotel can do about them. I also know that inner city crime, drugs etc are a problem all round the world. But I don\u2019t expect to pay big money for a \u201c4 star\u201d hotel which is a 3 star at best, in an unsafe part of the city. Oh, and incidentally, 3 robbers attacked one of my friends on the Metro before he\u2019d even got to the hotel. Unluckily for them, he\u2019s a police officer, so instead of his cash, passport, i-pod etc, they got a few broken noses. You don't have to walk everywhere in Barcelona, but you might want to consider it... No matter how you travel, keep your whits about you. Barcelona \u2013 probably won\u2019t ever go back; there\u2019s many nicer places in the world.

The rooms were extremely clean with a maid service every day. Hairdryer, iron, mini bar and a safe for valuables all provided and the room was air conditioned. Could not fault the stay at all, definately a 4 star. We didn't eat in the hotel because we thought the breakfast overpriced and it was cheaper to eat in any of the cafes on the same street. We were out all day and ate in the restaurants off LA Ramblas. We were a 5 minute walk from Las Ramblas, turn right outside hotel and cross road to take st. Monica street which meets Las ramblas near the Colombus monument. Some of the connecting streets were probably a bit dodgy after dark but during the day were very busy and safe. We noticed a lot of police around both day and night. We took a taxi back each night and paid between 5 and 7 euro. The avenue paralel which we were staying on, is as it's name suggests a parallel street to las ramblas. The staff had good english and the upgrade to a suite was a major plus and the location couldn't be better. I would definately stay here again. Taxi from airport cost 28 euro to the hotel and 24 euro going back. Make sure to take the open top tourist bus- a ticket for two days cost 27euro each. A tourist information office is located on Las Ramblas near plaza catalunya. Everyone from the shops. hotel staff, restaurants and tour guides all had excellent english which made it very easy to communicate.

I assume this time of year is pretty expensive to stay in the city as what I paid was well above what I normally would pay and while the hotel stay was pleasant and I have no real negative things to say, the price was overinflated definitely for the standard of this hotel. For a lesser price though I would have been very happy. It is supposed to be four star business hotel \u2013 for me it is more like a very good three star. The hotel check in was smooth and efficient. There were no issues with the booking or the pre-payments which had been made. We were able to check in before official check in time of 1pm which was good and on the day of check out they stored our bags securely for the day until we returned that evening to collect them. Service at all times was excellent from the reception staff to the porters, security, restaurant staff and maid service, and very friendly. The reception staff spoke excellent English and we were provided with a map of Barcelona on arrival. The room we were allocated was at the back on the hotel so it was quiet enough. The room was as seen on the pictures they use to advertise the hotel except that I asked for double bed and got 2 twins pushed together which was the only bad thing. The room was ok size, one English news channel on tv, expensive mini bar \u2013 but was as expected. The room and bathroom were very clean and in good condition, and maid did respect the do not disturb sign every day we were there. There was air conditioning and heating which you worked yourself so we could control it which was fine. Not too hot or cold. The bathroom d\u00e9cor and facilities were new enough. There is a lobby bar which is very small and the hotel has a caf\u00e9 next door. We didn\u2019t use either though. The breakfast was from 7 until 10.30 which is good for late risers like me. It was a very good buffet of hot and cold items, was very well supplied right up until the end and with good service for tea/coffee to the table. As regards location, it is well located or not so well located depending on your opinion. It is on a very busy road about 5 minutes walk from Port Vell. It is right beside a metro station which was great as we used the metro a lot. It is walking distance of a lot such as the port, Plaza Espanya, the Montjuic Park, Las Ramblas, Gothic Quarter, shopping areas and Plaza Catalunya so you do not always need to take metro and it is possible to walk at night out to restaurants and bars and back again so no need each time for taxis. It is about 10 mins walk to Las Ramblas down Nou de Rambla which is the side road opposite the hotel entrance. And we did walk a lot. However, what I did not realise when booking was that this hotel is on the edge of El Ravel which is the red light district and a not a great area in general. This area is in between the hotel and Las Ramblas. It did feel a bit intimidating on some of the streets in the area both day and night. However, we got used to it, and Nou de La Rambla was actually fine at night to walk through \u2013 it also has a police station on it so I guess that is why people say to use this street. We walked about at 2/3am in the morning with no problems. Some people may prefer though to stay in a nicer area at the other end of las ramblas nearer catalunya. Las Ramblas also towards the port area did get a bit intimidating at night. I was not impressed with Las Ramblas at all. I think I had a more romanticised view of what this street was about. The other streets around it are far nicer to walk down. And what is the story with everyone trying to sell cans of beer on the street??! Thankfully the rest of Barcelona was much nicer than Las Ramblas and I needed far longer than 5 days to enjoy it. However, where was all this great nightlife I thought it had? I guess you really need to know the places to go. I found the nightlife and selection of bars and restaurants disappointing and it did not live up to my expectations of a hopping all night scene in and out of bars and clubs. Then again, I\u2019m used to that being normal at home. In summary, I would stay again in the hotel as it was very central and I had no complaints about the hotel itself, especially if it was cheaper at a less busy time of year.

At the Tryp Apolo, we received none of these. The hallway, admittedly, is clean and adequate, but the room was not. After a completely sleepless night due to noise and temperature issues, I rose earlier than expected to take a refreshing shower, only to discover that the shower changed temperature approximately every 15 seconds. The soap dispenser (not a bar, but a body/shampoo soap dispenser) was annoying to operate and made me feel dirtier when I was through. Each time we asked at the front desk for tourism help--including the opening hours and days of certain landmarks--we were given conflicting answers, none of which turned out to be correct. Breakfast was promising, with a good variety of foods. Additionally, the hotel's location makes touring easy, being a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas and virtually next door to a Metro station. However, when we returned to our hotel room, we discovered that our temperature, which we'd spent the first 24 hours adjusting, had been changed although the room was not adequately cleaned. Finally, after paying the exorbitant rate of 22 euros for 24 hours of internet, when it ceased working we went downstairs to ask about how to get it to work. The front desk staff was not only unhelpful, but following a lengthy discussion, which clearly proved they were not listening, we were told that it was an external service and therefore not their problem. The last time I was in Barcelona, I booked a 6 euro per night bed in a 16 bed hostel room, and I had a better experience there. I am very disappointed in the Tryp Apolo, and the location and breakfast do not make up for this appalling experience.

Of course I refused this and made my disappointment known to them however in typical a Spanish manner they appeared not to care. Further disappointment was noted when we saw the state of the tiles in our bathroom. One was actually broken and there was a hole in the wall and numerous others were cracked badly. A large rust stain was also marking the tiles below the steel bath rail. This should not happen in a so called 4 star hotel however after my experience complaining about the twin room we decided to accept out lot and put up with it.

I got an alert through a travel deal newsletter that the parent company Sol Melia was having a huge sale on off-season rooms, and we were able to book our stay for less than it would have cost to stay at most 2-star Barcelona hotels. For such a low price, I wasn't expecting much, so I was very pleased with the value we got. The hotel is just out of the well-tread tourist area, but it's an easy 10-minute walk to La Ramblas. The walk isn't the most scenic - passing mostly kebab shops - but I didn't feel the area was particular seedy or dangerous. The hotel is also right at the Parallel metro station, which is convenient for longer trips and the Montjuic funicular. Having stayed farther north on a previous visit to Barcelona, I actually enjoyed being farther south with quicker access to the Gothic Quarter. The hotel was especially convenient for our cruise transfer, and the taxi to the ship was just a few minutes and a few Euros. The hotel itself is a fairly non-descript business-style hotel. The lobby is well appointed, although the hallways and rooms could use a bit of refurbishing. The rooms are on the small side but not tiny. Ours looked out over the inner courtyard for an uninspiring, but quiet view. The bathrooms were reasonably equipped with the generic hotel fixtures, including a weak wall-mounted hairdryer. However, during showers the water temperature fluctuated enough to be annoying. The television aired no English channels except a payment-required film channel. One fun feature is the pillow menu that allows you to phone the front desk and order one of a half dozen varieties of pillows according to your tastes. We used this service for both our stays, but on the second, they simply brought us additional versions of the standard pillow rather than the type we'd requested.

The english channels on the TV were all pay per view, and you price includes 4 movies, a bit too much unless you are planning to spend your holiday in the hotel room!

Try the 101 in the steet opposite the hotel or the local bakery directly opposite the hotel on Par alel....great coffee and pastries for 1.50 euro at brakfast time.

To be fair to the hotel the biggest problem this hotel is its location. Located near to the bottom end of Paral-lel its in a decent location for Port-Vell etc but the area around the hotel is pretty run down and you do not want to be using any of the streets that cut across to La Rambla at night or even daytime for that matter. Not a massive problem but it means that you really have to think twice about taking a walk down Rambla at night as there is no really safe way back to the hotel. The biggest saving grace this hotel has is the Metro line just 20 yards from the front door. Once you figure out how it works the Metro is superb allowing you to get the better areas of the city easily and back to the hotel in relative safety. Buy a 10 trip ticket, its well worth it. Drinks in the Hotel are expensive and the lobby bar very quiet. Note the drinks prices are not on display anywhere either. Funnily enough though Room Service was reasonable and there was a dial a Pizza feature too. There are a few bars in the area around the hotel but to be honest they all looked a bit grotty which leaves you with the hotels inflated prices or a trip on the Metro elsewhere if you want to go for a drink. Staff were pleasant and helpful and the rooms comfortable and in good condition. Breakfast was ok but there wasn't a massive choice of hot food, maybe because it was the off season? One last point is to beware of the taxi drivers. We were ripped off totally from the Airport to the hotel. The driver suddenly losing all understanding of English he understood perfectly well when we got in the cab. Driver on the way back was \u20ac10 cheaper so make sure you get a rough indication of any fare and any supplements added before you get in and beware of getting the grey haired rip off merchant with the Citroen BX when you get a taxi at the airport!", "Date": "December 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4107031", "Content": "Excellent value for money in a great location.

I had to help check in our large group and the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. They spoke English and were just very professional. Check in was easy. The rooms are modern and clean, clean bathrooms. Don't be surprised at the beds - if you get a King room it will be two small beds pushed together - but very comfortable. I thought the breakfast buffet was the best I had throughout our entire trip and we stayed in Europe for a long time after the cruise and went everywhere. Spanish cheese and sausage, pastries, hot eggs, omelets, waffles - a little of everything. Oh - a tip - to turn on the power in your room, stick your key card in the slot inside the door - no one knew how to do this - very modern way of conserving energy and keeping track of your key!

In saying that, we did not feel unsafe and saw no evidence to support a feeling of unease.By the end of the stay we felt quite relaxed about the walk- after all you do pass a large Police Station on the way!
