{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel Lombardia great location We stayed for two nights. Third floor up. No elevator but certainly did not expect one as we have gone budget the whole trip so it was no problem to walk up. The location of the hotel was great. We had a big bedroom overlooking the main street. Once we opened the main window it was very very noisy. When closed there was still some noice but we were so tired each night it did not matter.No airconditioning but we did have three fans. Bathroom was VERY small. The shower was very weird. It just has a curtain to stop the water, and the curtain was not very big. Nothing much to seperate the shower from the floor so by the time we had finished showering the bathroom was flooded.Breakfast on first floor as part of the price, not really into bakery for breakky, just some plain buns would have been great but the hot tea and orange juice was nice.Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.Would stay here again.Jacquie", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR449838755", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nzwestie"}, {"Content": "Would not stay again 1. Large Room2. Strange bathroom. There wasn't a shower. There was a shower head and a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor, which did not appear clean enough to shower on. We were only there one night, so both my husband and I avoiding showering until we got to Rome! 3. There is not an elevator. We were on the 4th floor. Not fun with heavy bags. Nobody offered to carry up our luggage. We (mainly I) just had to struggle thru it!4. They claim to have a bar, but they didn't really have any selections. 5. Staff was very friendly (except for the luggage thing).", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR669946972", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "tswalker226"}, {"Content": "Great city hotel Most convenient. You can walk to any popular place no more than 30 minutes. To go to Florence get a train ticket for 6.50 euro then walk to the other end of the airport, come out and take the train to Pisa Central (5 min). Go down one level and look for Firenze SMN (probably platform 5) which is the end station and takes about 1hr 15min. Don't forget to stamp the ticket before boarding the train at the begining of the journey using one of the little yellow stamp machines. Quite a few steps to go through even boardng the train. Inconvenient for senior citizens and difficult for disabled people. Arriving Florence walk past McDonald on the right hand side. Turn right when come out of the station, Lombardia is right opposite over the roundabout on the main street or you can go down the subway and go straight ahead and Lombardia is the first hotel after you come out of the subway, about 50 yards away. Like all 3 stars hotel in Florence central you have to walk up to the room (no lift). If you can get the rooms at the back it will be very quiet. Avoid the first floor if possible as the breakfast room is there. The bedroom is comfortable, very clean. The staff are excellent, very friendly. The bathroom is pretty crammed and the shower water runs directly on the floor. The towels are thin unlike the normal ones we use. There is no English channel on the televison. No fridge or teamaker. (I presume most city hotels has no fridge or teamaker unless you go for at least 4 stars)This is a good value 3 stars city hotel, I like the excellent location, the staff, the cleanliness, the bedroom. I just find the bathroom is a bit small and I don't like the wet floor after a shower.", "Date": "Mar 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR792666140", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kysKent"}, {"Content": "super convenient, super friendly It's a simple basic hotel. The common room is great, the stairs not so great. There are air conditioners in the rooms. Ours worked just fine and the bathrooms are pretty standard for Europe. It's very convenient to the train station and to the duomo and the other sights of Florence. The thing that makes the place stand out from the others is that the operators are so friendly and personable, always ready to help with directions or just friendly conversation. Go to the Baglioni across the street to splurge on a fantastic dinner with a view of Florence, but unless you want to spend a ton of money to sleep in a four star, staying at the Lombardia is a great way to go.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR486110571", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jlubean"}, {"Content": "Basic This hotel was very easy to find when we arrived at the train station which I thouhg tinitally was such a great choice by me!!

It is a short easy walk from the train station. From the hotel, it is a 5-7 minute walk to the Duomo and on into the main tourist area of Florence. Serivce: The staff at this hotel are exceptionally friendly, accommodating and helpful. A-plus in the service and hospitalty category. Made up for shortcomings on the accommodations side, which are detailed below.Room: Our room was on the top level (up 5 flights of stairs). No elevator. Not a problem for us but lack of elevator should be noted for anyone who has a problem climbing stairs. Room was fairly spacious but quite sterile. Had the ambience of a college dorm room before it's been decorated. Minimal furnishings very much of budget quality, no throw rugs (which are a nice plus when the weather is cold), thin bedspreads, flat pillows, etc. Bathroom was extremely small and shower was tiny with a curtain set-up that didn't work in terms of keeping water in. Hence, showering caused a general flood of the bathroom floor. Towels not the terrycloth kind but rather the material more akin to cloth napkins. This is a budget property -- just detailing these points so you know what to expect.As far as we could tell, the TV in the room received no CNN International or BBC. All Italian language programming.Property features a small bar/social room which got quite a bit of use during our stay and is also where breakfast (warm croissants and beverages) was served. Area featured old and not comfy furniture but it served its purpose and provided a convivial gathering spot for guests.Free Internet access via one computer in the breakfast room.
