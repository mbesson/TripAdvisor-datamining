We chose this hotel based on it's location, the only good thing about our booking. Everything else however was a disaster. 1. All three of us stayed in separate rooms and all had the exact same problem of \"over used\" uncomfortable and crunchy beds. 2. The rooms were very small. The bathrooms smelt damp and one of them only had a shower cubicle. 3. One of us had to stay in a basement room which smelt of smoke every time people had a cigarette by the hotel front doors. 4. The wi-fi is exceptionally weak proving very difficult to do any work in the evenings. 5. The hotel staff came across rude, un-interested in the customer or their own job satisfaction for that matter. 6. The breakfast was poor quality and very expensive, we ended up eating breakfast at a Gregg's cafe up the road. 7. All three of us had to have cold showers, even at 7am there seemed to be no hot water. 8. The lift was smaller than a phone box and we had to go to our rooms one at a time. 9. The door key cards kept loosing their data. 10. After seating for breakfast on the first morning we were then told to go and pay for our breakfast at the reception rather than adding it to our room. There were no signs saying this was the process before we checked in. 11. Very squeaky floorboards in ALL THREE rooms and what sounded like every other room. 12. The cold water is not even cold. I had to use bottled water to brush my teeth with. 13. Finally the basement room had bars on the windows, it was like a prison cell. This review is not exaggerated and I fail to see how there are 5 star ratings for this hotel.

On the strength of the lovely room I had at this hotel last year, I booked again for a week's stay, this time with my husband. I asked for the same room or one equivalent to it and was assured that I would get one. However, instead of a large high-ceilinged room, nicely fitted out, and with bay windows overlooking the square, we got a small, cramped dark room down an inconvenient short flight of stairs at the rear with small windows, no view and basic furniture (for the same price). To add insult to injury, every time we went in or out of our room during the day we had to struggle past the unappealing sight of piled up dirty sheets from the other rooms which were left in the short walkway to our room and we had to avoid tripping over the vacuum cleaner which was also always stored there. We were obviously of little interest to the hotel as repeat visitors and were given what was surely the worst room in the place. Having not wanted to start our trip (which was actually a special occasion trip for us) with complaints, I didn't say anything on the first day but by day 3 we were very fed up with the dirty washing we had to edge past and made a complaint. We were told this would change but all that happened was that the washing was stored in a large laundry bin on the way to our room. Trying to use the bar one evening for a quiet drink, my husband ordered a beer but found the blaring television very intrusive and asked the young woman working there if she would mind turning it down...even the adverts were played at full blast. Nothing happened. At the second time of asking, she couldn't even be bothered to swivel her head from what was obviously her favourite program but just snapped that she had turned it down. Fed up with adverts for hair products etc, my husband gave up and left. Staff serving in the breakfast room showed little idea of what might be pleasant for the guest rather than the easiest for them, always attempting to squeeze us into the rather odd tables in the first room (which tilt up towards you so that drinks, cereals etc flow downwards to the centre) rather than suggesting the more spacious area in the conservatory. You have to be firm and insist on finding your own table. This hotel gets business people attending Earls Court & Olympia exhibitions & conventions etc and is apparently also listed on some package tours.

Second room (because of snow our flight back home was cancelled and we could stay in the hotel for the extra night, but in a different room) was a bit less small, and warmer, so we probably were just a tad unlucky with the first one ;) First night there, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, (and repeatedly 2 times more). To be clear: you can't sleep through it, it was loud enough. We gathered to the lobby, were the personnel assured us there was no fire....Didin't see any smoke either.

What we would have liked to see different, was that they would have left a note or something in our room the second day, to let us know the fire alarm issue was resolved.

On the plus side, it is well located -- only minutes from the underground -- it is clearly well-managed, clean, efficient, comfortable (to a point), and benefiting from the virtue of helpful and friendly staff. Rates are reasonable and a good, continental-style buffet breakfast is provided. On the negative side, it is small. The foyer is small -- you can live with that -- the bar is small, and the dining room, although adequate, feels cramped. Small tables congest the floor space to the extent that although you may be dining alone, you sense you are encroaching on the adjacent diner. That absence of personal space is such that on being assigned a table, you feel like a battery hen placed in its slot for feeding. The lounge area is so small, I missed it for the entire duration of my week's stay. I think I may have passed through it without noticing. Or was it ever there? Step into a bedroom in the Burns and you are instantly inspired to take up the study of nanotechnology. Our bedroom was really small, although it was allegedly a double room. In fact everything was scaled down, including the beds, furniture and the bathroom. But it was clean, well presented and diligently attended to everyday. And after a day or so, you adjust -- shrink -- to fit the room, and it doesn't seem too bad. The hotel claims to provide free WiFi, but this is largely hit and miss ...... and mostly miss. When you can connect, it is so slow it is hardly usable. But it does exist, and unlike some hotels, the Burns make it availabe for free. One black mark concerns catering practices. One morning at breakfast I noticed the senior waitress top-up a milk jug with the remains of milk from jugs on nearby tables, which other diners had left after finishing their breakfast. In fact, I couldn't fail but notice, because it was at my table and she did it in front of me. Now this is akin to presenting you with a potential reservoir of bacteria to start your day. One has to ask, what is in the minds of the Burns management to countenance such a practice. It is deplorable, and it is dangerous. It also manifests an uncaring attitude to the well-being of its guests to place people's health at risk just to save on the cost of a little fresh milk. I am sorry to have to mention the above, because overall I feel the Burns Hotel makes a genuine effort for its guests. Their approach is professional, their staff are genuinely friendly and they are streets ahead of similar sized hotels in this area in terms of what they offer. What they definitely should not offer is the chance to develop an unsolicited bout of gastroenteritis -- and that is something they need to address. The acid test: Would I stay here again? Yes. Would I recommend the Burns Hotel? Yes. So, sorry to introduce a sour taste into my comments about a good hotel. If anyone can tell me that the Burns have improved on their catering habits, I would be happy to delete this post.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "NottinghamFourontour", "ReviewID": "UR62572416", "Content": "Great location, close to Earls Court Station.

The lobby is lovely. And the staff is very good (bit rare for a lot of budget London hotels!). So I was hopeful it would live up to descriptions online. Then I got to the lift. Let's just say that everytime I got in, I wondered if I'd end up trapped in there forever without recourse. It's small, there's no status display in there, and no emergency phone. I was on the 4th (top) floor, so I had to use it. It's also painted black from the outside, so I felt some foreshadowing each time I walked up to it! The floors in the halls were the typical bumpy \"few buildings joined to make one\" thing. A bit annoying with luggage to have to go up and down stairs in the middle of a hall for no apparent reason! The room I had was small, but not too bad. But the bed was rock hard and the walls were thin. I could hear lots from other rooms, though luckily I had a corner room so I mainly heard the people next to and across from me at times. This was mainly a problem on the weekend when people were in town for football or other events and were being a bit more festive than usual or coming home later than normal. There was lots and lots of counter space in the bathroom (a plus!), but the toilet handle had to be held down and then lifted up to flush (not due to design, just due to being halfway to broken). I'm sure it was just my room with that problem, and luckily it kept working till my leave. I'd of not wanted to lose that counter space!! The hotel is kept very clean by their maid staff, and the location is right near the tube and a bunch of handy places on Earl's Court Road. But it was just a disappointment overall. It's just run down and a bit dim, really. Plus, some of the hotel sites I'd researched said the hotel rooms offered AC, but there was none. So for air the window had to be kept open and then propped open by whatever I could find. During the few rainy nights while there, the window was knocked back and forth from the wind and was a bit loud, though I got used to it. Friends booked a nearby hotel for much cheaper than mine was, and they had a room that looked exactly as I thought mine would if mine had lived up to expectations. I might stay at their hotel next time if I can get a deal on it! EC is a great location to base yourself in.

The breakfast, which was included, was quite tastey; and the hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating. Now the bad: Upon CLOSE inspecition, the room was filthy. There were visible stains on the walls and the carpet. The carpet looked like it had NEVER seen a vacuum. The area around the toilet was very scarey with visible mildew and \"crud\" and there was constantly a sewege smell coming from the bathroom. For the first night, I was actually afraid to close my eyes to sleep. It is also important to note that the rooms are not air conditioned. It was not a big deal for us since it was cool in London, but that could be a tremendous problem in the summer.

On the downside, there was no air conditioning and we were reluctant to leave the window open as it opened directly onto the fire escape so it would have been very easy for an intruder to gain access. Beds were so close together that one could not walk between them. The bathroom was tiny and we had no bath. However it was great value for money 110euro per room per night to include breakfast.

The room itself was fine and larger than some of the reviews here had led us to expect, although the decor was very tired and showed signs of DIY maintenance. The TV was very small and it's a bit misleading of the hotel to say that rooms have satellite TV - it ought to be made clear that there are only 2 satellite channels (Sky News and Nick). The room itself was the hottest room we've ever stayed in. Even with the radiators turned off, and the window open, the room didn't cool down enough to be able to sleep properly. We tried leaving the window open at night but this meant that we were kept awake by the noise of nearby trains frequently rattling past. Closing the window helped a little, but the trains were still audible and having the window closed meant the room was unbearably hot throughout the night. Almost all of the floorboards creaked incredibly loudly so it was impossible to move around the room quietly. The hotel advertises free wi-fi in all rooms but we were unable to connect with our laptop - the network name given in the room information didn't appear in the list of available networks on the laptop. The room information said to obtain an information sheet on wi-fi from reception but, when we asked about this and how to connect, we were told that it might be too weak a signal from the room and we should try from reception or the bar (this despite there being a wireless access point right outside our door). We tried connecting from reception and still couldn't connect. Asking staff again, we did then get an information sheet containing the password and lists of the available networks - it's a pity this wasn't just included in the room information or given to us at the fist time of asking. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was very good, although it felt very rushed. We were shown to a table and the waiter pointed out the continental breakfast buffet bar and took our order for cooked breakfast, tea and toast, whisking away the menu before we'd even had chance to look at it! Barely had we started our juice and cereal before the cooked breakfast was served to us, followed a few seconds later by toast and tea! When we came to check out, the hotel had added onto the bill \u00a32.00 for the use of the room safe, which we hadn't used at all. I pointed this out and they did immediately deduct it from the bill but it felt as if they were trying it on. All in all, the hotel was OK but the overall experience was quite disappointing. It was noisier than we had expected and the extreme heat of the room meant that it was just too hot to sleep, which meant that we started the next day feeling exhausted.

We LOVED it! Overall, the best thing about this hotel is the location. It is close to all the conveniences. There were several grocery stores close by and that's where I bought almost all my food. Sommerfield was my favorite and it had lots of yummy ready-made sandwiches and crisps and candies and yogurt. I enjoyed trying the different food and the prices were actually not bad. I had brought a bunch of food with me thinking that everything was going to cost an arm and a leg, but I was pleasantly surprised to find better food prices than Chicago (where I was living at the time). Bottled water is especailly cheap in London! My roommate enjoyed the fact that there was a McDonald's close by as well. There were several other fast food places but we pretty much stuck to Sommerfield and McDonald's. There is also a Barclays (bank) right there and I believe that they do not charge a service fee. Yay! And then of course, the location is prime because of the Earl's Court tube stop, just a few minutes from the hotel. It was a quick ride into the main tourist spots (10-15 mintues probably) and SO easy to use. The hotel itself was also quite adorable. It's true that the rooms are small, but you are in Europe. We expected small and were actually surprised at how big our room was. Not big by American standards but bigger than what we were expecting. We had a bathroom, two twin beds, a TV, desk, and still some room to walk around. I can't say that the beds were especially comfortable, but they did the job. And the best part was that we had the cutest little balcony that looked out onto a large lawn and what looked like beautiful brick apartments. It was February when we were there so we didn't spend a lot of time on the balcony but it was nice knowing it was there and it also doubled as a fridge at night and we could put our goodies from Sommerfield out there to stay cold. The only negative I can say about this hotel is that the staff was not the most friendly.

Booked the reservation through Expedia and had no problems on check-in. Only a bit of a snafu: I thought for sure our reservation included a continental breakfast, but upon checking in found that it did not. We were able to purchase a voucher -- the night before -- for a discounted breakfast tho. The breakfast was the basics but it was very serviceable and filling with eggs, breads, meats, yogurt, and some cold cereals. We had a twin room -- it was small but clean. The bathroom was always kept spotless and the shower was great. Not sure that housekeeping ever ran a vacuum the 6 nights we were there, tho. The rugs were a bit dirty and needed replacing. Biggest complaint about our room was that it was in the lower level and on the Barkston Gardens side of the hotel. It was a bit noisy with people passing by, and there was some kind of access door just outside our window -- possibly from the kitchen -- below street level. On the 2 mornings we weren't out of our room by 830a-ish we heard fairly loud talking and people were smoking just outside the window. So be careful of room 49. The folks at the front desk ranged from very helpful to a bit prickly at times. They did point us in the direction of some nice restaurants in the area. The location is a huge selling point. We were at Earl's Court, and only about a 3-minute walk from the front door. Very convenient when lugging luggage. The neighborhood had plenty of food choices, ATM terminals, convenience stores, grocery stores. I'd definitely stay there again -- from earlier reviews I had read it sounds like they are putting money into the hotel to update it.

This hotel really had a lot to do with what was a wonderful vacation.", "Date": "July 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cGot Roaches?

Also, the location is great--just off the Earl's Court tube stop and very easy to get to pretty much everything. But that's about all I can say that is positive about this hotel. We arrived on one of the hottest days on record in years in London, only to find that the \"air conditioning\" the hotel claims to have is only in the hallways (that is, of course, on the rare occasions when they didn't have the heat on). They did provide us with a tiny fan, but it didn't help much. The room was exceedingly small, but we expected that because most European hotels are like that. Be prepared for your feet to hang over the edge of the bed (I'm only 5'7\" and mine did...). The beds were also quite lumpy and uncomfortable. On night two, we found a roach practically the size of a car roaming about our room. To be fair, they credited us a few pounds at checkout for that, but that courtesy was later overshadowed by the huge annoyance I experienced as a result of them screwing up the charges on my credit card (see below). On night three, the room reeked of raw sewage. At first we thought it was coming from outside, but it was actually coming from the bathroom. Needless to say, the fan didn't help THAT much, either! Over a week after checkout, I discovered that the hotel had failed to release the hold they placed on my credit card when I checked in (even though they had also charged me THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE STAY when I checked out, thereby taking up double the room on my credit card). Apparently, as I found out after paying for several international calls, the hold is not released until 10 days after they authorize it...which means that this hold will have been on my credit card a total of 25 days by the time it is actually released. They failed to mention that little tidbit when I checked in. My advice: steer clear of the roaches and raw sewage and head for another hotel!", "Date": "June 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisiana, USA", "Title": "\u201cGood Location & Good Value\u201d", "Author": "timtripin", "ReviewID": "UR3375065", "Content": "Stayed here in May 2004 before heading to Normandy, France with my dad and uncle (D-Day vets).

We got a smoking room on the 2nd floor at the back, as non-smoking rooms were not available, but were astonished as neither the room nor the corridor smelled at all. The room was small but cleaned and super quiet. Didn't hear a thing during the whole stay. The radiator in the room was very efficient. We could switch it on and off and regulate the temperature at our convenience. The bathroom was a mini sauna as the towel rail was always boiling hot, but at 3 degrees C outside that wasn't a problem, specially in the morning. Breakfast was very pleasant, with bread, preserves, croissants, fresh fruit juices, yogurt, boiled eggs and cold meats. Staff efficient and attentive. Overall, a comfortable unpretentious hotel with charm. Very convenient for Heathrow airport by tube.
