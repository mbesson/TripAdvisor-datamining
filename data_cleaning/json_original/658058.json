{"Reviews": [{"Content": "absolutely fabulous We stayed at the Segara Village, in a deluxe bungalow for 11 days august/september 2008.if you want night clubs and parties-avoid sanur.if you want a lovely peacefull place, with local culture, friendly people (apart from the street hawkers who while still friendly, can be a bit annoying-but not as annoying as some other areas of bali), tons of bars and some very good restaurants, sanur is great-the segara is brilliant.the room was lovely. Big, clean, and (for Bali) all mod cons.The staff couldnt do enought to help, the grounds are spectacular, espcially when lit up at night. The building work that people seem to be worrying about is complete (apart from the tennis court which looks a bit ropey-but why go to bali to play tennis?).Our bungalow had our own pool outside which we only had to share with residents of the other 8(ish) bungalows, but there was rarely anyone else there. The hotel mailn pool is lovely. and there are smaller ones dotted about the huge grounds.Breakfasts were ample and good(if a little unusual occasionaly), coffee shocking, but there is a great cafe next door on the beach.There's tons to do- trips all over the island-or just hire a guy and his car for \u62e230 for the day and get off the tourist track.There are loads of places to hire cycles-and its very flat, so easy and fun. Snorkelling off the hotel beach past the reef is superb.Quite simply, i would reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants comfort, and a bit of luxury without paying european prices.Our 11 days cost us \u62e2750, for the deluxe bungalow, 2 dinners, and a ridiculous amount of alcohol -all imported exensive stuff, not just local- several international calls, 2 laundrys and hours of intenet time. An absolute total bargain. Superb.only downside-which we learnt on day 3- hotel internet slow and expensive- go to beach walk turn right and 100 yards down, fab air con internet cafe, great coffee again and dirt cheap high speed broadband. that is my ONE critisism of the hotel!Highly recommended.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR741327038", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Bev_manchester_8"}, {"Content": "Segara Villaage Very Very Ordinary Segare Village definately not 4 star quality. lovely grounds.

Hi, just returned from 10 nights in Sanur and while Bali and it's people are still fantastic the hotel was disappointing. We were not given the rooms we had booked and when we asked for upgrades (and offered to pay the difference) we were declined yet they continued to move other people around throughout our 10 days there! The hotel breakfast was just and didn't have a lot of variety and don't waste your money at the jacuzzi bar as they water down drinks and make really bad cocktails.The best things about the hotel was the gardens and the pools they really were fantastic and the staff, apart from the receptionwere wonderful and friendly and very helpful.

We booked on the basis that friends had stayed twice before.The room given was renovated but cramped and noisy (next to road at rear) and young children enjoying themselves. The bathroom walls were glass with venetian blinds. Use it at 3 in the morning and everyone wakes up! Not a good idea. We complained and were moved (upgraded) the following day to a quiter part.Breakfast, we thought, was good. Never ate there otherwise. Location is good, staff are pleasant  helpful. Overall the stay was good but not special.Find Kayu Manis restaurant for a really nice meal - and cheap. And if you are game to try something very different try the garage almost opposite.

Meandering paths led through the lovely grounds, until we came across a quiet bar still serving drinks. We spent a pleasant hour or two winding down before heading off to our bungalow. When we opened the door to our room to our horror there was a pile of droppings in the middle of the bed - I assume (and hope) from a rather large lizard. Too tired to make a fuss, we removed them and settled down. Our bungalow also had an additional room reached through a door and down a short flight of steps. While we were trying to get to sleep, we could hear something moving around behind the door. As the door was firmly shut, we managed to ignore it and slept until mid-morning the next day.As we pulled the curtains we came face to face with a couple of builders who looked as if they were in the middle of a long-term construction project just outside our bungalow window which hadn't been noticed the previous night.Luckily we hadn't unpacked our cases and reception were quite happy for us to move to another bungalow quite a distance from the first. Whereas the first bungalow seemed extremely dark and dingy, this one was a lot lighter and more welcoming and I'm happy to say we didn't experience any unexplained noises or droppings during our stay.One peculiar daily occurrence happened as dusk fell, at which time hundreds of large moths would appear, fly around for about ten minutes, then shed their wings and drop on the floor to die. Bizarre!The Segara Village is arranged to resemble a Balinese village and the grounds covered a large area at the northern end of Sanur Village. There were two pools within the grounds and the hotel fronted onto an unremarkable stretch of beach, which though pleasant enough, certainly wasn't the tropical paradise of picture postcards. To reach the main road running through Sanur you needed to walk up a narrow road, which incidentally was treacherous in the dark, with several huge potholes and an open manhole with a drop of several feet.Sanur Village was relatively sleepy and not too crowded and I'm pleased we stayed there rather than Nusa Dua with its huge luxury complexes. Sanur at least had some genuine village life in the surrounding area.The village had a large number of restaurants catering to all tastes and nationalities and we ate in a different restaurant every night. We took breakfast in a little restaurant right on the beach.I must admit we have never encountered such relentless hawking/pestering from local traders anywhere in the world. From the moment you set foot outside the of the hotel (on the beach side) you were continuously accosted by locals who would trail behind you for hundreds of yards. No amount of shakes of the head or polite No thank-you's would make them give up. Even ignoring them didn't work. We have endured this practice for many years in various places around the world but this has to be the most aggressive behaviour ever. On one trip to Mount Batur we were literally mobbed from the moment we set foot off the bus. It was really unpleasant, annoying and embarrassing, and hopefully this practice isn't as persistent now as when we visited. Bali is a lovely island to explore and there is plenty to see for those who don't wish to sit around their resort or spend the day dodging traders on the beach.We would be interested to see the Segara Village once it has been refurbished, but would probably stay in another part of the island (not Nusa Dua) if we were to return.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR515865269", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "testla"}, {"Content": "Wait until the renovations are complete ! The Segara Village is marketed as a 4 star plus resort. That is perhaps their goal, but it is NOT YET reality. The parts of the hotel which have already been renovated (reception area, many rooms, front garden areas) are quite nice. The area of the garden which has been renovated is quite peaceful and pretty. A nice place to relax and read.The problem is the renovation is incomplete. They tore down their old restaurant, hoping to construct a new one. Apparently money problems have prevented them from completing their new restaurant. In the meantime, you'll eat in either a small old meeting room or under a dirty tarp supported by bamboo poles. It's already collapsed once in high winds. Careful.A third pool and the jacuzzi pool are almost complete but still not usable. They, and the unfinished dining area, remain a bit of an eyesore.The staff is very friendly and helpful. The two new pools are very nice. The new rooms are sharp and clean and well equipped.I found the food ok. Nothing special but more than edible.I had trouble with a telemarketer calling me at the hotel, telling me I had won the grand prize. How did he know my name and room number? Somehow private guest data is leaking from the hotel to the pushy and deceptive telemarketing people in Bali. The front desk suggested that perhaps the police were selling the information (hotels in Indonesia are required to register each guest with the police). I'm not sure if it was the police selling guest data or a hotel employee. I hope they take care of that soon. It made me feel quite uncomfortable to have a complete stranger know my name and room number.Also had trouble with the hot water. I took 5 showers in 3 days, but only once did I have hot water.AC worked well. Everything seemed quite clean. Bed, pillows, sheets, and sofa all very comfortable. Probably are new.Yes, be aware that vendors in Sanur are a bit aggressive. Just smile and walk past them. No need to say anything at all to them.", "Date": "Feb 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR866053818", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "IndonesiaLongTerm"}, {"Content": "Hated it I just returned from Bali and stayed at this hotel for the 1st two nights. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Yes the grounds are nice but the room I had smelled, was dark and the bathroom glass door was so heavy I could barely open it. The breakfast was bad and I couldn't even eat the other food. Once you stepped on the beach (which was not like the photos) you are haressed by vendors.

The Segara Village is up near the northern end of Sanur, really it is Sindhu Beach. It is in the middle of extensive renovations right now and it should be good when completed. The existing poolside bungalows are very nice, we moved in there as soon as there was space as the old garden bungalows, while clean and okay, were past their use-by date. The breakfast was not much and the food in the restaurant pretty dismal but there are plenty of places to eat all along that stretch and some are pretty good, apart from the endless repetition of the same menu items and the almost total lack of any kind of Asian food - a few Thai-style dishes all blanded out were the best of it - this raises the question of why everyone would go to Bali to eat pizza and spaghetti? One of those little mysteries of life. As far as Segara itself is concerned, the staff were not very interested and the lighting as usual was dim to the point of darkness. But the room was fine. Didn't even try the internet at the office, because two or three good Internet cafes were nearby including one right on the beach. Sanur itself though is in steady decline. Everywhere was pretty empty, and a number of places to the south seemed to have closed altogether. Apart from swimming (the beach is swimmable at high tide, though often a bit grubby), eating and sleeping, there's nowhere to go and not much to do. The real Sanur outside on the main road is just a super busy by-pass road. Okay for a few days relaxation - and Segara was pretty good, although again a bit overpriced. Some people at nearby bungalows were only paying $20 per night, so if you fancy Sanur or Sindhu, shop around first.", "Date": "Jul 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR890894290", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ann-de-Mot"}, {"Content": "fantastic totally great- lovely staff, right on the beach and we had a lovely little cottage room with basically our own small pool beside it. lots of lovely restuarants nearby ( try the laocal coperatoev run one outside the gate to the beach)- woudl definelty go again", "Date": "Jul 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR881876914", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "katie26"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel We had a very pleasant stay in this hotel in 2005.
