Parking - not happy ever about paying $20 a night to park but it is what I expected. Rooms - above average furnishings, below average bathroom, comfortable enough. Staff - not over-the-top-friendly, not rude For a hotel I would normally say that this place would be a 4 star. However, for the price point, I would expect a bit more. The staff COULD have been nicer. Two times I walked by a bellman with 2 bags, 1 double stroller, and 1 basket, juggling everything together on the stroller. Not only did he not offer to help (isn't that his job), he pretended not to see me and didn't hold or open the door for me. When I asked the check-in lady a question, she looked at me as if I asked her the most ridiculous question (asked about cancellation policies). She gave me a simple 'no' answer. It wasn't rude, per se, but it wasn't polite either. Checkout was a nightmare. A line that was at least 25 guests long (all from the same party). Took forever. I would normally just do a checkout via phone but I wanted to change the credit card that would be charged for parking. Oh well. Location - while the location is great, it is not great. My friend stayed at the Hilton Torrey Pines. Now that is a GREAT location. This location is in the right vicinity but not the exact right spot. The only thing it has going for it location-wise is the Flemings across the entrance. I would stay here again if I could get a room for about 80 bucks (priceline or something). Add to that parking ($20/night) and $100 is about max I would pay out of pocket. Anymore than that (and they routinely charge over 200 a night) and I wouldn't even hesitate to stay somewhere else.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cLocation and common areas above average, rooms just OK\u201d", "Author": "DavidfromMadison", "ReviewID": "UR127320077", "Content": "We stayed here for the first part of our spring break trip to Southern Cal.

I do think the rooms need some updating with the wallpaper & tile in bathrooms other than that it was comfortable & quiet. I noticed the light out at the entry and a slight smell from the sink drain and informed Melanie at the desk and it was taken care of while we were out for the day.I was concerned when I didn't see a coffee machine so I called the desk and they let me know it was stored on the top shelf in the closet and sure enough it was there. I bid on this hotel on Priceline and won it for under $100, picking San Diego Coastal and while La Jolla is coastal, this hotel is about 10 miles from any water.It is conveniently right off the I-5. The hotel is a short drive to the Westgate UTC mall, we ate breakfast at the Cocos across the street. The night we arrived at the hotel we went to Melting Pot to eat which is right across the driveway from the hotel along with a sushi and steak place. For a family of 4 the bill was $89 and only one of us had wine, a little too pricey for me. The room we were given was on the 11th floor and a view of the well heated pool. This pool is shared with a nice gym in the complex but it was never too crowded and plenty of towels on hand and nice cabanas that most hotels require you to reserve & pay for but not this Hyatt. The pool is set up so people from the hotel can swim & not interfere with lap swimmers from the gym. The hot tub was just luke warm on the second night and a call to the desk had maintenance out there in less than 15 minutes to fix it. They offer you the option to use the big fancy gym for $13 a day but the hotel has it's own smaller gym that is free. I could pick up the Wifi by the pool that is offered free from their lounge-Michael's. I would stay here again but only if I was able to snag it for under $100, there is a parking fee $20 or $25 for valet. Since I got a good deal on the hotel I didn't mind the fee. There is parking on the street but this hotel is surrounded by office complexes and it seemed to me most of the street parking was taken.

Actually spent quite a bit of time at the hotel because wedding events were on site in the downstairs ballroom both nights. We arrived around 12:30 p.m. and a non-smoking two-queen-bed room wasn't ready yet (not complaining, just stating) so we checked our bags with the bellhop and drove to downtown La Jolla. The front desk staff weren't that friendly at check-in (nor during the rest of the visit, they were OK, but nothing special), though the bell service staff was more friendly. They called when our room was ready, which was nice. Our room was on the third floor with a view of the front of the hotel and restaurants across the driveway. Not that exciting, but kind of fun to watch all the comings-and-goings. When we got off the elevator, it smelled like cigarette smoke, which continued as we walked down the hall. Inside our room though was fine. Just annoying to have to walk through the scent every time we made a trip from the elevator. Room was clean and nice, with small windows you could actually open for some fresh air. Bathroom was fine as well, with usual amenities plus toothpaste. Our room was never made up though by housekeeping on the next day of our two-night stay, which seemed very odd. We were gone for about five hours total during daytime hours, and were surprised to find it as we left it. We finally got a knock on the door around 5:30 p.m. asking if we'd like housekeeping to make up the room -- at least they finally came, but at that point we were in the middle of getting ready for the wedding that night so declined the service. I feel like 5:30 p.m. is pretty late for housekeeping, even if the hotel is busy (we saw carts on our floor earlier in the day, so not sure why we were overlooked). We didn't get any knocks on the door earlier in the day and didn't have a \"do not disturb\" sign out or anything. We did track someone down later for extra towels and bathroom amenities. Spent some time in the Michael's bar both days between sightseeing and evening events. It's a little pricey, but typical of hotels, so to be expected. Staff was friendly enough, good seating options indoors and outdoors (though some weird stains on the chairs) and a decent atmosphere, too. Also, the ballroom was a nice space for the wedding and smaller pre-wedding ceremony. There's also a Starbucks in the lobby, which is handy for a quick coffee or breakfast snack. Parking here isn't the greatest, but it works. It's $20 for self-park, $25 for valet. We did self-park. We got a $10 coupon for parking at the on-site ceremony, but were informed at the front desk it's only for local people (so locals get a discount, but not guests of the hotel spending a few hundred dollars?). The parking garage is mostly underground, and fairly dark -- could use some more lighting. It felt safe, but just dark. Also, you have to take separate elevator or stairs from inside the hotel, so it's two separate rides down (with a walk outside in between) to get from the garage to the hotel. The location is fine in that it's right by I-5 so easy freeway access, but it's not really walking distance to anything. We stayed here because the wedding was here, but otherwise would rather be walking distance to downtown La Jolla. Overall, this is a fine place to stay, quite nice in a lot of ways -- I just found a lot to nitpick. However, still worthy of a stay if you want to be close to the UCSD campus or otherwise like the location.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada, United States", "Title": "\u201cThis place is NOT worth the $$$\u201d", "Author": "Allison S", "ReviewID": "UR126806064", "Content": "I traveled to La Jolla to attend an appointment with my father at Moores Cancer Center.

I stayed at the Hyatt for work and was very impressed by the excellent service we received. We had group of about 40-50 staying in the same hotel. The rooms were very clean and nice although I did dock one point from rating because there were no outlets placed in spots that would seem obvious. For example, they have a very nice large mirror near the closet, but not outlets by the mirror. The only outlets in the room area that was in a reachable place was near the desk and the desk did not have a mirror. However, the flip side to this situation is that room service was nice enough to bring us an electrical strip so we could place it near our bedside table. Also, the pillows look very comfortable at first, and then as the night goes on they tend to sink a little too much. I ended up sleeping on 2-3 pillows since it would sink down by the morning. The gym is an excellent facility and helped us stay in shape since we were there for 1.5 weeks.

Room Service did an excellent job helping fix and accomodate whatever we needed. We had some minor problems with the toilet, but Engineering came promptly to fix the issue. The hotel bar had a great fireplace outdoor to roast marshmallows or just hang out. The lounge inside was a good place to unwind after a long day, grab a bite or drink. The hotel is located near the La Jolla downtown, the USC and Scripps campus, the mall, and a few shopping centers.

Every time we needed anything, they were friendly and very helpful. i forgot my toothbrush and i also needed so aspirin so my husband called down at 11pm and they opened up the store for him to get aspirin and they had the toothbrush and aspirin ready for him by the time he got down there. they also gave us a page of restaurants in the area to go to dinner. and they were really quick getting us everything we needed. we called down for towels, glasses and pillows at separate times, every time we called they had what we needed to our room within ten minutes. we were very impressed.

While the hotel is not exactly what you'd call a charmer, the rooms were very nice, the nearby restaurants in the hotel circle are top-notch (we had a dinner at the hotel's Cafe Japengo, and it was not only super-stylish but the food was fine, whether salmon teriyaki or assorted sushi rolls), and the service was very good for the most part. A few criticisms: the parking lot requires a bit of an outside walk to get back to the hotel, and at $20/day, it's not too reasonable. The bed looked great, but wasn't particularly comfortable to sleep in. And the Barcino breakfast restaurant is located in a cavernous space in the lower lobby, which makes it feel drafty no matter what; the food there was quite good, but the service was rather slow and a bit disinterested. Pluses: the front desk service was great -- friendly, quick, and helpful. The valets out front and the parking staff were especially helpful. And finally, I discovered this place through a deal I had not been familiar with on Travelocity: their Top Secret Hotels deal. Through it, you can get super discounts on various hotels; the only thing is, you only get a description and a vague location -- you have to reserve your room before you find out exactly where you're staying.

The room we received was updated, very modern and very clean and nice. It had 2 Queen sized beds, plenty of pillows and a big screen TV. Although we didn't eat any meals there, we did go to the bar, Michael's- service there was great- and they even have gas firepits outside and you can watch TV outside (football games, etc) while enjoying your drinks. It is a sports bar theme, and they give you a \"sound box\" for your table, so you can hear whatever game you are watching- I thought that was a great idea!

My husband was disappointed that you can't use the gym for free- you have to pay. I'd say that was the only down-side to this hotel.

The final issue made us super irritated, we had booked an airport shuttle via concierge for our departure and had the reservation confirmation sent to our room.

Overall, we had mixed reviews about this hotel, so I'm not sure I would consider going back. NEGATIVES: --SELF-PARKING IS $20!!! Valet is $25!!! Outrageous. We tried to find street parking at night, but since everyone else was trying to avoid paying this exorbitant fee, street parking was full. We were informed that the parking garage is NOT the property of Hyatt, hence they were unable to waive the fee or adjust it in any way. This is unacceptable. How could a hotel NOT have its own parking? And there was no mention of this fee on their website when booking, which makes it all the more annoying. This is pure bait-and switch. Thankfully, we only stayed one night. I read another reviewer who mentioned that a 5-night stay could add $100 to your bill! --GOT A SMOKING ROOM WHEN WE REQUESTED NON-SMOKING. Sound like other reviewers had similar problems. --BATHROOM NEEDS UPDATING. The shower fixtures in our room looked like they were about to fall off! Tiles looked dated. --NO SOUNDPROOFING. I agree with other reviewers that the walls have no sound proofing. Every noise from next door (bath and shower, running water) could be easily heard. --HOUSEKEEPING ISSUES? When we checked in to drop off our bags, there were used glasses outside our door, and noticed that several other rooms had dirty dishes in the hallway, waiting to be picked up. When we came back in the evening, the dirty glasses were still there! --NO MINIBAR OR COFFEE MAKER IN ROOM. So don't be afraid to ask for coffee vouchers at check-in. POSITIVES: --PLEASANT CHECK-IN. Staff member Pedro was friendly and pleasant to deal with. He was very helpful and offered coffee vouchers, maps to the city, local recommendations, etc. One other reviewer mentioned him by name--Hyatt management would do well to commend him for doing his job well. You would be surprised how other 4- or 5-star hotels mess up the check-in experience. --GOOD DINING OPTIONS. At least four fine-dining restaurants are located across the street. -- QUICK RESPONSE TO ROOM CONCERNS. With the issues about the room mentioned above, I called the Front Desk to see if it was possible to be switched to a different room. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked, but they immediately offered a price adjustment. Also, within 10 minutes of calling, someone from housekeeping was there to \"freshen up\" the room (as usual, all they can really do is spray the room with a neutralizing freshener to cover up the smoke smell) and pick up the dirty glasses. And also within 10 minutes, someone from engineering was there to check in on the bathroom fixtures. While they weren't really able to do much, it was at least nice to see that they responded quickly and made you feel that they weren't just ignoring your concerns.

Shower/tub pull and temp control required Herculean effort to operate, and even then tended to leak water.

Even after ComicCon was well over, never seemed to have anything available until you wound down a couple of floors. From the giant, car-killing speedbumps on the way in, to finding a space, to navigating the long hike back to the hotel, to actually making it to my room was a good 15 minute process. Every. Single.

Also, there is no place in the hotel (again, aside from the bar) that serves dinner, leaving you with the choice of pricy specialty restaurants across the street, or bar food. Be that as it may, the HRLJ is a great hotel in a great location.

We took advantage of the \"free Sunday\" promotion so only paid for two of three nights. We booked a room on the club level enjoy breakfast and snacks as provided. This is most definitely a \"business\" oriented property, so being charged for parking and internet is to be expected. Our room was great, on a high floor overlooking the pool. The staff throughout the entire property were pleasant and accommodating, from the valets to the front desk folks, to the Michael's bar staff. The only meal we ate at the hotel was in Michael's one evening after spending the day at the Safari Park. Food was very good and our waitress, Konstantina (sp?) was in one of my daughter's classes at State! We ate one dinner across at the Melting Pot and it was excellent as well.

I pulled up to the front of the hotel and asked if I could just unload my luggage, and that I was hoping to get a spot to park on the street. They obliged and helped me with my luggage. Then the bellhop Tony came to assist with getting the bags to our room. He was AMAZING! So helpful with information and making you feel relaxed and comfortable. The hotel wasn't busy, so he even arranged for a late check out for us, and gave me a map of the area including where to eat and how to get to the best beaches. Fresh cookies and lemonade as we set out on our way to SeaWorld were a pleasant surprise. Doors were always opened for us, check in/out was a breeze, and the room was very quiet, spacious and comfortable. Having the adjoining room with the kids was great. We were on the twelfth floor.

Close to the airport and a short drive away from downtown San Diego. Though it has \u201cLa Jolla\u201d in its name, you\u2019re not within easy walking distance to the village of La Jolla. It is, however, a very short drive away. You are close to lots of shopping and dining. We love the location. Some others have complained about the location being too far from La Jolla Village or from downtown San Diego. But we like the convenience to all of that. This is Southern California \u2013 no matter where you stay, you\u2019ll need a rental car to get around. And this location provides quick and easy access to all of the sites in the city, Balboa Park, Coronado, the north county area, etc. Typical of most Hyatts, Hiltons, Marriotts, etc., they do charge for parking, Internet use, etc. I\u2019m not crazy about that, but that\u2019s just how it is. It seems to be primarily a business hotel, so it makes sense that they will try to make money off of people with expense accounts. So be it. If you\u2019re looking for free parking, free Internet and free breakfast, then keep driving until you find a Holiday Inn Express. We arrived very early in the day after an early morning flight. Not expecting our room to be ready, we went to drop off our luggage. To our surprise, our room was ready. Each of the staff people we encountered \u2013 valet, door man, front desk, guest services, etc. \u2013 was most helpful.

The pool is large, with a very large hot tub, fountains, etc. It\u2019s surrounded by chaise lounge chairs, dining tables, sofas, and cabanas. It can accommodate a LOT of people before it begins to feel crowded. It was always quiet at night \u2013 great time for an evening swim or soak after a fun day of sightseeing. The health club requires a fee \u2013 it\u2019s in a separate building near the pool, and part of an adjacent office complex. Kind of a bummer if you\u2019re looking to work out every day. I didn\u2019t use it, but it appears to be very nice and offers spa services. If you\u2019re just interested in cardio, then ask about nearby trails or jogging routes.

Luckily I was on vacation for the purpose of unplugging from the world. Had this been a business trip I would either have to pay the bounty for Internet access or select a hotel that does not insist on nickel-and-diming its customers. I read about parking on several travel websites but did not let it prevent me from booking this hotel. Valet parking is $8/hour or $25/night. Self-parking in the garage beneath the hotel is $3/hour or $20/night. My wife and I were able to cope with the parking situation but it was a major inconvenience. We elected to save our money by parking on the streets around the hotel. This was only possible because my wife and I are athletic and she was able to take our bags to our room while I parked the car when we arrived. If you are traveling by yourself or if long walks (including several flights of stairs or major inclines) tire you, I suggest planning on using the self-parking in the garage. My shortest walk from my car to the hotel lobby was 200 yards and including crossing 6 lanes of traffic and 3 flights of stairs. My longest was a quarter mile, though it was traffic and stairs free. There are other businesses and apartments in the area that each has patrons that park along the streets, making finding a spot near the front of the hotel difficult.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cwhat a great weekend in La Jolla!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jlrb07", "ReviewID": "UR74049872", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency LaJolla for a long weekend to attend a wedding last week.

(Long review, but necessary)\u201d", "Author": "toetread", "ReviewID": "UR68315613", "Content": "Below is the letter I sent to Hyatt following a 4 day stay. Only after contacting them twice to complain did we receive a brief apology along with a gift card that would cover a portion of a single night stay (which I do appreciate). I am told that they can't refund me any money because I purchased my stay through Priceline (so does that mean that Priceline pockets all the money? :\\ )Even now I am still waiting to hear back from Hyatt management about our experience (but I don't expect one a fix). Read this and realize that despite the abundance of great reviews, you could have an experience like ours with a hotel that seems to care very little about fixing things... Based on our visit at the La Jolla Hyatt Regency from May 28 - June 1: While I begin to write this, I am trying to figure out where to begin. First let me say, that I am rarely one to write in a complaint. I typically let things slide off my shoulders pretty easily before I make a fuss about anything. Let us continue... I'll preface my comments about the hotel with my experiences prior to our arrival at other hotels. My wife and I have been planning our vacation to Arizona and San Diego for over a year. Exhausted from the demands of our rigorous careers; we planned and entered our vacation with high hopes for rest and relaxation. Everything started out well enough. We were exhausted from a day of travel (our flight had been oversold which added quite a bit of time to our commute). Your staff was friendly and professional. When I inquired about a potential upgrade (it never hurts to ask), your staff at the desk said that the hotel was quite full and that upgrades were not available, but said she would place us in a corner room which might provide us a little extra room, which was very nice. However, when we arrived in the room there was a hint of stale smoke in the room and the room window was open (perhaps to air it out) which wasn't such a big deal except that my wife is a bit allergic to cigarette smoke. With it being such a long day, we simply decided to let it slide, stepped out to pick up something to eat, and continued to let it air out. When we arrived the smell was still there, but it was late and we were tired. No big deal (except for the small spider I killed in the bathroom)...until we were rudely awakened the next morning at 6:30 AM by what could have been considered the loudest toilet I've ever experienced in a hotel (even the simple cheap hotels I've stayed in previously). I tossed in the bed for the next half hour as water rushed through pipes (showers) and the toilet continued to flush above us. It sounded as though the room had a toilet built right above the bed. The doors in the hallway that were closing were so loud in the room that I nearly got up to check that it wasn't our door that was being opened and shut (I am not kidding). Despite my best efforts the noise level simply wouldn't allow me fall back asleep. I realized that it was early, so I went downstairs immediately to see if there would be a possibility of moving to a different room sometime during the day. The desk staff suggested that there was another room on the same floor that was open, if we would like to try that. I agreed to try the room in hopes that it was under a quieter location. At this point I became curious if our experience was of consequence to having obtained our reservations through Priceline. I inquired about my theory with the front desk attendant who assured us that the Hyatt was not involved in profiling their \"Priceline\" guests. So, after a long day of travel and a short amount of sleep; my wife and I re-packed and made several trips to move our belongings down the hallway to what we expected would be a more pleasant experience for the remainder of our vacation. Immediately upon entering the room it was apparent that the room looked like it had been in a \"bar fight\" based on the excessive indentations and scuffs on the walls. The sink was cracked, the lighting in the bathroom emitted a constant \u201cbbbzzzz\u201d which brought back memories of a stale florescent lit office. While I didn't think that this was a good reflection of a four star establishment, I let it slide. My wife and I did not want to waste another moment of our vacation squabbling over less than desirable aesthetics and accommodations. We returned from our day exhausted and eager to relax. The mood for relaxation was immediately halted as the elevator doors opened to the fourth floor; the stench of cigarette smoke assaulted our senses. We hurried to our room to escape the stench. We simply wanted to relax. I looked around the scuffed up room again now that we were settling in and noticed a bunch of dirty debris and sticks (remnants of the room\u2019s previous guests). Still hoping to regenerate an atmosphere of relaxation; I chose to ignore the dirt. I figured a hot shower would do the trick. The filthy shower walls with black streaks and a drain caked in brown filth snatched away any bit of potential for relaxation that remained. Hoping that the \u201cfilth\u201d were simply stains like the scuffs on the walls; I wiped the black marks on the tub and a greasy grime came off on the washcloth. I wiped the drain and the dirty washcloth now resembled a dirty cloth that someone had used to wipe check their oil on a car well overdue for an oil change. This got me more curious, I began to wipe the dirty bathroom walls and was surprised that the walls began to come clean with a couple of wipes. Despite my mental gymnastics attempted to maintain the illusion of clean and calm; my brief investigation revealed that the room appeared dirty because it was, in fact, dirty. Right about that time, my wife began to cough from the cigarette smoke that was invading our room from the hallway. I took my dirty washcloth, picked up some of the debris off the floor and walked downstairs (passing the hallway trash can with the 3-4 cigarette butts on top of the decor). While downstairs I very politely showed the filth of our room and explained the cigarette situation to the desk attendant. The desk attendant went back to get the night manager. After explaining the situation again, the manager apologized profusely for the situation, stated that the hotel was currently full, but that arrangements for a move would be arranged first thing in the morning and that they would try to upgrade us to a nicer room. They said that they would investigate the situation concerning the smoking as well. I went back to the room where the scent of cigarette smoke was still lingering and went to bed frustrated and disappointed. The next morning we waited for the front desk\u2019s notification to, once again, move rooms. Around 9:15 AM a new round of cigarette smoke began (along with more coughing from my wife). Anxious to get the move to the third room over with so we could begin our day and vacate the Hyatt for the day as soon as possible; she called the front desk to inquire about the promised room. They responded that they would call within the next 30-45 minutes and would put in a request to rush for the maid service to prepare a room for us. Although quite hungry, we concluded it would be better to hold off on eating breakfast until after our move. An hour passed without a phone call from the front desk. I finally went downstairs and asked about when the room would become available because we wanted to get started with our day. The desk attendant stated that they had a room available on the 12th floor. I inquired about the upgrade we were teased with by the night manager from the previous evening. I was told that the hotel was too full and that there weren't any upgrades available. (How were the night people able to say that an upgrade was available the previous night, but now all of a sudden there wasn't any upgrades available?!) I was told that I could have my name put on a list to see if anything could become available around 3 or 4 and that I could move again at that time. Not anxious for a move to room #4; I declined the offer. She gave us the keys to yet another new room (along with nothing else) and sent me on my way. After lugging our belongings to the 3rd room we noticed a few differences...the room was clean and possessed a pleasant scent. (Back to my statement about Hyatt Priceline profiling...it just seems a bit odd that there was nicer decor and cleaner rooms offered to us in the end on the 12th floor. I don't know if the 4th floor is considered the Hyatt\u2019s \u201cdent and bent\u201d section reserved especially for Priceline guests, but it sure did feel that way). Famished, tired, frustrated, and disappointed; we were finally able to leave the Hyatt sometime after 11 AM. Our stay in our third room proved to be more pleasant than the previous two rooms on the fourth floor. We were disappointed that we were denied the opportunity to enjoy the luxury of a clean and well kept hotel room for the previous two nights at the Hyatt in La Jolla , California . My wife and I were surprised and dismayed that no efforts were made to compensate us for our multiple \u201cinconveniences\u201d while staying at the Hyatt. In fact when I was checking out, the attendant asked how our time was and I told her that our first half with the hotel was pretty disappointing. She responded with, \"Well at least you had nice weather though right?\" While that is true, I could have enjoyed nice weather with a more regal experience at a two or three star hotel. As I reflect on my trip to San Diego , I am truly grieved that the lowest points of our vacation was the majority of our stay at the Hyatt. I did not expect to be writing a complaint letter to the Hyatt at the conclusion of our vacation. In fact, my motivation behind trusting the Hyatt as our vacation homestead was to achieve relaxation and rest for my wife and I with as little room for complaint or inconvenience as possible. If there is anything that can be done to repair this broken situation, please let me know.

Parking is free for AAA members. Stylish, attractive public areas. Cons: Room was smallish and a bit battered. Definitely needed a makeover, especially at the price. A bit of a walk to the pool, and the fitness area charges for use of its facilities. Conclusion: Not bad, but for the price they charge, I expected a better room.

I did exactly what he said, and then returned home from my vacation to find that the company had charged me for 21 days or rental (when i had requested 3). Seems there was a mix up or something with the hotel and Enterprise. Whatever the case, the company made it very difficult for me to get this sorted out. I kept getting referred to and from the regional and national offices. Basically the La Jolla Enterprise said it was not their problem and that I had to deal with the national office. After about a week and a half and many hours on the phone, I was finally reimbursed. They did not offer anything to me to make up for my troubles. It was an interesting experience dealing with the Visa costumer service as compared to the Enterprise customer services. Visa dealt with it on the spot and made me feel like a priority.

The stay was disappointing from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. When we arrived at 4:30 p.m., our rooms were not ready. They were supposed to be ready at 3:00 p.m. The front desk didn't know when they would be ready and told us to go sit buy the pool and buy $8 drinks. The pool area is very nice with a large pool with lanes and a whirlpool. When we arrived at the pool, there were no places to sit. Finally a table opened up and we sat down. After an hour, I went back to the front desk and inquired about the rooms. They were still not ready and the front desk still had no idea when they would be ready. It is now 5:30 p.m. Front desk told us we could use the Regency Club during our stay due to the delay. I thought this was a nice gesture. We went up to the Regency Club and started to get drinks and food, when the front desk saying they would be right up with our keys. So we only got a quick soda thinking the keys would be right up. A half an hour later, the keys finally arrived. When we got to the rooms, the refrigerators had not arrived, so then we had to wait for the refrigerators until we could leave. The rooms did not face the pool as promised, which was to the west so we could watch the sunsets. The Regency Club wasn't available after the first visit, different from we were told. Finally, the refrigerators arrived and we left. The next problem was that we could not get on the internet in our room. Its bad enough that the Hyatt charges $9.95 per night, per room for internet service, but we were not able to get on. We called the front desk and were told that an engineer would come up to get us connected, but they never showed up that first night. We called again the next morning and were told an engineer would be up, but they never showed up again. We were finally able to talk to an engineer, but they were unable to get us connected. So I would not count on internet connectivity in this hotel. And it is very troubling that the front desk told me twice that someone would come to the room to connect us to the internet, and no one ever came. Another thing to be aware of is that in the King room there is no desk. So if you plan to work, you should get a room with two queen beds, which includes a desk. Also, there are virtually no available electrical outlets in the rooms other than those needed for the television. Also, there is no phone book in the room. Another situation to be aware of is that you must be 18 years old to enter the work out facility. We were traveling with two 16 year olds who needed to work out related to extra curricular activities, and were stopped at the door by an attendant and told they could not enter because they were not 18 years old. They asked if they could come in if a parent was with them and were told \"no\". Next, I would recommend avoiding a room at the end of a hallway. In my room there could be heard a loud banging noise on an intermittent basis during both the second and third nights of our stay. I reported this to the front desk and they told me they would look into it, but I never heard back from them and the noise continued right up until we left on Wednesday morning. At checkout, they told me they checked but that there was no noise, which only added to my growing frustration after two sleepless nights in their 4 star hotel. Also at checkout, they had charges from one of their restaurants on my bill which I never stepped foot in, so I had to go through the process of having that removed from my bill. Another situation to be aware of is that if you happen to use Hyatt points for your stay, at this Hyatt that does not cover valet parking. When I have used Hyatt points in the past, I have never had to pay for parking. The valet parking was $25.00 per night. Self parking was $20.00 per night. Finally, when we were leaving, we carried all of the luggage out to where we load the car. I received a call while waiting on the car, so when the car arrived the doorman just started cramming all of the luggage into the trunk. When I saw him doing this I told him to stop, but he just kept right on cramming. By the time I could get off the phone he had the trunk full with about 2/3 of our luggage. I came and told him to stop - again - that we had more to go in the trunk and you couldn't just throw all the luggage in their in some haphazard fashion. In the process of his cramming stuff in, a Christmas ornament was broken (which we found out after we arrived home). So then I had to pull the luggage out of the trunk and repack it. This is the most dismal stay I have had at a Hyatt. We were very disappointed. I tried to limit my comments to keep the length manageable. I would not stay at this Hyatt again even for free. It is not conveniently located, not even to La Jolla. This hotel is at least 3 miles from La Jolla. It is not close to a beach. It does have any good views. It does have a Melting Pot, Flemings, and Japengo's (sushi) right next door that you can walk to, but if you don't want to spend $50 to $100 per person for a meal, you have to drive somewhere.

Staying on the Club floor provides opportunities to meet other travelers for breakfast or afternoon hors d'oeurves. There were very few children on this floor, and those that we did encounter were very well behaved. The included continental breakfast was the same food as in the hotel restaurant, as far as we could tell. The granola was to die for! Added to vanilla yogurt to make a parfait - YUM! Also their fruit was awesome. In the lounge, there are two computers for travelers to use. Some people are very inconsiderate and do not abide by the 15-minute request. Those people should just pay the additional charge and work from their room if they have a laptop. Some people were surfing the web. I used it briefly a couple times to check work emails, but many times there were lines of people waiting to use them. The rooms were freshly redecorated with quality furniture and bedding. The linens were high quality, which was nice. There is nothing worse than scratchy towels and bedding when traveling. Well, there is a lot worse, but that is a pet peeve of mine. Elevators were very fast, but it would be nice if the top levels had their own elevators. While the banks are split from lower to higher, it can take a long time to get from the top floors to lobby level when it stops at every floor. Some people do not know elevator etiquette and jam themselves in an already-crowded elevator instead of waiting for the next one. But that happens everywhere, not just at hotels. It just would be nice to have express elevators for the top few floors (similar to some hotels in Las Vegas). Everything was clean clean clean! Mrs. Clean and Mr. Fixit must work here.

I ordered flowers through the e-coinsures and they were suppose to be in the room when we arrived, which they were not. I ended up getting roses even though I ordered gerber daisies. The best part was that they did not write anything on the card. I had nice message that was a surprise for my wife and they forgot to put the card with the flowers. I call down to the front desk and am on hold for 10 minutes and when I finally get to talk to someone they tell me they will have to talk to a manager. 40 minutes later a manager calls back and says that they will provide an extravagant gift for their blunder. They sent up a fruit plate, which consisted of a green banana, apple and orange. I could have walked to the closest store and spent $2 for this so called extravagant gift. After dinner and a night cap my wife and I go back to the room. We call room service to see if we can get a bottle of wine. They say no and my wife calls back to try and see why they can't give us a bottle of wine. When she calls the man on the other end refers to her as a drunk and tells her to raid the mini-bar. My wife is insulted I'm angry so I go downstairs to talk to the manager and he tells me that I am just a customer that can't be made happy and there is nothing he can do. So at 1am my wife and I pack our bags and leave the hotel on our Honeymoon! Absolutely, the worst hotel experience I have ever had. The incompetence of the manager and staff was unbelievable.

I was attending a conference at this hotel so I really had no choice, unless I wanted to commute from another hotel each day. However, our stay was a very pleasant one. The front desk staff greeted us promptly at check-in and even gave us breakfast coupons to use each morning at no additional charge. Any time I needed something, they were more than accommodating and friendly to us. As with most other upscale hotels such as this one, the Bellmen are quite insistent on taking your luggage from you and toting it to your room. My husband and I really prefer to do all of this ourselves for various reasons, but this Bellman was not about to take no for an answer. So I let him do his job and tipped him accordingly. However, when I would see him again in the hotel, he acted as if he had never even seen me before. Our eighth floor room had a nice view overlooking the pool area. The bathroom was a nice size - larger than the average hotel bath. It didn't feel cramped like most others. Everything was very clean and in working order. Well, almost everything. The A/C cooled the room but it never seemed to remove the humidity as it should. The room always felt muggy. But since the weather in La Jolla is a beautiful 70 degrees, we just opened the window and enjoyed the breeze, even at night. Our room had an iron/ironing board, a normal size hair dryer (not one of those compact models), and a safe to store your valuables in. This was a nice ammenity. The bed was one of the best we've slept on. Very comfortable mattress along with down bedding. About the only time we heard noises outside our room was during the day while housekeeping was busy cleaning rooms, which is to be expected. It was quiet at night time. I do not recommend using room service at this hotel. If you do, be sure you ask for it to be delivered at least 15-30 minutes before you need it. That way it might actually be on time. They are quite slow here. I've stayed at a lot of nice hotels such as this one and have yet to find one that has acceptable room service. The food was good once I received it, even though the order was never exactly as I had requested it. (One morning I received a phone call at 4:30 AM telling me my breakfast was ready. I had asked for it to be delivered at 7:00 AM! ) The hotel conference facilities were very nice. The staff did a nice job of making sure we had plenty of beverages for breaks. The hotel provided lunch for us during the conference - both days the lunch was very good. The serving staff did an excellent job here, too. We used valet parking for our rental car. The valet staff is the best I have seen. Very prompt and courteous. The valet parking is $22 a day, however, we were only charged a one time fee of $20. I'm not sure if that was a mistake or intentional, but I didn't argue with it! Even if you don't have a rental car, taxis are plentiful. Also, there are several restaurants just steps (literally) from the hotel door: Fleming's and The Melting Pot, along with a few others. I highly recommend both of these. Downton La Jolla is a beautiful place on the coast with lots of restaurants and shopping. It's about a 10 minute drive from the hotel.

We were moved to a king-bed room the next morning, but that night, we cranked the thermostat up to 80 and shivered under our blankets, waiting for the heat to come up. We finally called the desk, and the hotel engineer came up, investigated, and told us we'd have to move to yet another room the next day. The heat finally did come on, so we decided to stay put. Each evening, we had to kick the thermostat way up, then dial it way down in the morning. A couple of other things annoyed us during our stay. For what we were paying for a room, we were disappointed to find that a lot was extra--parking, the sports club, breakfast. The restaurants next door were very up-scale and expensive.

The desk staff were very friendly (and remained so throughout our 8 night stay) and we were in our room after a few minutes. The rooms are not big but they more than make up for it terms of comfort and ambience. The furnishings were pleasant and comfortable. The bed and pillows were comfortable although ours squeaked a little bit, but not enough to cause us any problems. I am sure if we'd wanted to do something about it, it would have been no problem. On the 11th floor we had a very nice view of the pool area and the hotel grounds. The ability to open a big window was also a very nice feature. The tv is an old style set but it's no big shakes to me. The bathroom was small but immaculate throughtout our stay. The shower was fine, which was a blessing after our previous hotel. The products were generally good too, although I found the soap dried my skin too much so had to stop using it. The only complaint in this area was that the towels were a little scratchy and could use replacing. The hotel has a small coffee bar that is open til 11am which serves tea, coffee and pastries. This is a blessing since the buffet breakfast is a little on the expensive side. I also used the outdoor heated swimming pool a couple of times. Although I am sure there was somewhere to change, I couldn't find it so used the mens room. It's a nice facility to have and that it's heated makes a difference especially in december when I was there. Parking is also a little expensive and this is certainly a deterrent from using it at $16 a day. As is the distance from the car park to the hotel itself, vast areas are sectioned off for valet parking which means self parking is relegated to the distant spots. We gave up on it the first day we were there and parked on the street for free and usually closer to the hotel entrances. For a decent breakfast outside the hotel I recomend Le Peep, it's a few minutes drive to Towne Centre Drive, located in the shopping plaza. It's not the big Westfield UTC mall, but a smaller plaza a couple of hundred yards further along the road. Be aware it shuts at 2pm. Nearby shopping at UTC is excellent, one of the best malls in San Diego IMO. There's also a smaller mall and AMC movie theatre across the I5 freeway, visible from the hotel, you can use Nobel Rd to get there easily. Overall, this is my second favourite hotel in San Diego, (after the Omni), it's convienient for most of the city, it's comfortable and the staff are excellent. We didn't leave our room until 4pm one day and upon our return our room was still made up even though we weren't expecting it.

The hotel is very nice and clean, but while staying there, we had over two-hundred dollars worth of amusement park tickets \"disappear\" from our room. After searching from top to bottom in our room several times, we went to report the matter to the front desk. The lady at the desk was very nice and polite and immediately called security for us. When the gentlemen from security came, he asked us what the problem was; after we told him what happened, he asked us what we wanted him to do. I was completely shocked by this response as it was completely unprofessional. We asked him to check who had entered the room besides us from the time of our arrival. He told us he would know immediately if anyone else had entered and that he would call us. We waited for several hours and never received a phone call. We finally called the hotel and they claimed that we were the only ones who had entered the room. We then returned to the hotel so that we could see the security report. They claimed that they could not print it out to show us. It was only when my older brother asked for the manager and asked her to show us the report did they finally decide that they could comply with our request (we had to wait about 20 minutes to finally see it). According to them, we must have lost the folder while we were in the room. There was never an apology for the inconvenience. The manager that we spoke to was neither polite nor apologetic. For the rest of our 4 day stay, we had to take all of our belongings to my brother\u2019s house in PB.

Upon arrival - if you arrive in the evening beware: Its very easy to miss the entrance of the hotel. There is no signage anywhere along the street which driveway to enter, and where the lobby was located. The entrance that we did end up coming in we actually left again, because we thought we were in the service entrance, as the parking garage, and lower levels had trucks unloading there. No grand entrance into a lobby, the restaurant next door Michaels was well lit up and thought there was just valet into their restaurant. Check in - Again arriving shortly after midnight, there was no bell staff, door men, or valet car attendants outside, to give any indication that we were in the right spot, and no one was behind the small front desk counter. Just a sign that said ring bell... The reception staff that came out, was extremely helpful and kind and had us in our room on the club level in a hurry. We were starving and when we got to our room, we rang for room service. We waited and waited for the phone to answer, placed our order, and waited. Not too long, but our food arrived, and it was delivered by \"the same front desk agent/ bellman (he brought our luggage up as well) and he said, oh i grabbed you extra dressing as well, for your salad, so i asked him if he prepared the salads as well. By the exhausted look on his face, and the sweat running down his face, it appeared that he did everything after midnight. And then i just felt bad. This was not Regency standards, and this guy was definately overworked. The Caesars chicken salad, had raw chicken, so couldnt eat it, that salad, and a sandwich was 39.00. Ouch. Pool area next day, was super fantastic, and staff was amazing, even under the worst case scenario, not enough chairs, not enough staff, and the place was packed for the 4th of july weekend. But they were gracious, and kind and handled the pressure well, for the most part, with the exception of one poor girl, who was abused by an irrate guest and walked off the job, leaving her collegues in a bind. The pool manager, she did a great job, trying to keep cheerful, and clearing, serving all in a black suite with 90 degree temperature. Well done there! One of our other rooms, had the air conditioning go out and it took the hotel 4 days into our 5 day stay there to fix it. The health club, and excercise area, was one of the nicest i have seen, great equipment, and roomy, 2 story building... fantastic. However, we booked 3 full hour massages, 2 full facials, at their last appointment on Sunday evening at 7pm. Finished by 8pm, and we were still wet from the shower, and the \"contracted spa staff\" tried to take our towels away from us at 805pm, saying that they were closing and 9 staff members were waiting to leave. We had just spent over 700.00 and we couldnt take a shower>? So i suggested that they make their last appt time at 630pm, so that they can close at 800pm without insulting a guest. Staff otherwise, in all areas, were completely up to par, friendly and helpful.

ALL THE GOOD: Like I said above the hotel is in a great location, you can get almost anywhere within 15 mins. As for the rooms they look great! They have a wonderful decor and are roomy (by San Diego standards). We ate a couple meals there because we where lazy and didn't want to go out and eat, the first night I thought the prices where way to high, but as the week went on I realized that $60 is pretty much the norm for 2 people. The people that work here are great they remember you and are willing to do just about anything to make you feel at home. A couple days into our vacation our shower was broken (it only put out hot water) and with in 10 mins the maintenance guy was in our room fixing it. They are very willing to help so don't be afraid to ask. ALL THE BAD: When we arrived I asked if they did anything special for people on their anniversary, the registration guy said yes, he gave us a key to the 16th floor which has the regency club (so free snacks, breakfast and etc.) He also said he would send a couple things to our room; however my husband and I never saw that stuff. We went back a couple days later to just inquire as to what had happened and this guy said he would send those up right away, We still have not seen the stuff. As a person who travels every once in a while, I thought for a hotel of this caliber we would have to pay for our meals, V parking... the obvious, but when we got a bill and we realized that they charged us $1.07 for each local call we made (mainly to restaurants to get directions) my husband was not happy. I will tell you up front you have to pay for EVERYTHING extra; the internet is like $10.... just stupid stuff. This is just me but I watch TV before I go to bed to wined down, but the connection was crappy, a few (2 or 3) stations were distorted, had some snow, just stuff that got on my nerves.

It's a lovely hotel from the outside, and the people I've dealt with have been friendly. The problem at this hotel is the housekeeping. This could be an isolated problem, and maybe even one housekeeper. My non-smoking room, has a bathroom that smells like an ash tray. Either the previous guests smoked in the bathroom, and it was never cleaned properly by housekeeping, or housekeeping smokes while he/she cleans the bathroom. I also found hair on my new clean pillow case. I blew this off as \"possibly the housekeeper's hair.\" This is now my second night here, and after returning to my room, I found that my bathroom was not cleaned. My own hair was still in the tub and on the floors. Which leads me to believe that nothing was vacumed or wiped down. If housekeeping can leave the obvious things undone, I am very concerned about the not so obvious things. I am getting more and more paranoid about the original hair in my bed (maybe it was the previous guests or maybe my sheets were never changed). I have already signed and scheduled an event for my company here next month, and I regret doing this. I have a few executives flying out to this event, and I will be embarrassed if they have the same \"unclean\" experience. I do plan to write the manager (my first time ever) and complain. This is a fairly expensive hotel, so my expectations are high. I have stayed at less expensive hotels where rooms were immaculate. The housekeeping staff at least on the 8th floor needs some re-training or replaced. If you're concerned about cleanliness, especially with a $250 nightly price tag...then this is probably not your hotel.
