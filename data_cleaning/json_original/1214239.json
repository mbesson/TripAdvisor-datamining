There is a shortage of non smoking rooms so you may have to put up with a smoking one. The rooms were ok but very noisy due to the main road. The windows do a good job of keeping the noise out but the ac was on constant heat making it impossible to sleep without the window open. The shower was also insanely hot and there was no cold water from the tap in the room. At the top is a decent bar with a good view. We did not have a chance to try the food. Overall not bad but really need to sort out the problems with water and tempeture.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harrow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent !\u201d", "Author": "hipskier", "ReviewID": "UR123516734", "Content": "Great little hotel!Even has pool and great breakfast!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zagreb, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "DeltaBravo_11", "ReviewID": "UR122959680", "Content": "For 80Eur a night, this hotel is a great value. It is rather far from historic center of the town (during the rush hour the only practical way would be to use a ferry from Bostanci to the other side of Bosphorus), but relatively close to Sabiha Gokcen airport. Room was clean, and spacious. Wireless Internet did not work properly when we arrived , but was quickly fixed by the staff when we alerted them to the problem. All the rooms had a massaging bathtubs! If you have business on Asian side of Istanbul, this is a great find.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gouda, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with interesting rates\u201d", "Author": "Eberg", "ReviewID": "UR77607495", "Content": "The hotel is located at a bussy street in East Istanbul. Rooms are comfortable with free wireless internet. My room had a dripping toilet what is annoying when you want to sleep. Breakfast did not start before 7 am, even not during ramadan. For early birds like me that are picked up at the hotel early in the morning for business that is unpleasant.
