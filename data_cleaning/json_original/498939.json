{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Worst Hotel we have ever stayed in My Husband John  I stayed at the Waka Namya resort in Septemeber 2008 we originally booked for 13 nights because of reading the reviews and looking at their web site. To say we were dissapointed was an understatement it was old and not just tired but gone to sleep. We had (apparantly the best deluxe room in the hotel) two storey with a day bed downstairs and a large bed up-stairs, the bedding was dirty and had stains all over it and the curtains were the same. The smell from the mosquito net was appalling and I could not sleep in it for the smell. There were cobwebs all over the rooms and the fridge was full of full of mildued water. The so called beautiful bathroom as shown on their site is old, dirty and not at all appealing. The bath is covered in cracks and was so dirty I could and would not use it, the sink was the same and as for the stained toilet well we won't even go there. When we arrived for breakfast on the first morning we were given a menu and told we were allowed fruit or fruit juice not both!! Javinese Tea or Bali Coffee and bread and what we got was awfull 1 baby roll 2 tiny quarters of toast 1 very small danish pastry and 3 cubes of butter the size of my little finger nail and one teaspoon of jam. Their were guests requesting a pancake for their child who didn't like the bread and were charged a fortune for it. Everything about the Waka Namya is tired and old there are no luxuries about this place. We decided to drive to Nusa Dua and look for another hotel on the third day and found a magnificent hotel called the Bali Khama which was streets ahead of the Waka Namya and both at the same price of 130 USD per night . When we advised the Manager at the Waka Namya that we were un-happy he was most helpful and came to our room with a note pad and looked at all the the things we mentioned he agreed with us fully but said he could not do anything as the owners would not put any money into the hotel. The Hotel Manager contacted his own boss and he came on the telephone to talk to my husband and basically confirmed what the Manager had said to us but also said as we were in the best room they had so there was nothing they could do except to clean the room better!! and up-grade our breakfast to a better one for no extra charge this woulf not have altered the way we felt at all as the ambience was not going to change and neither was the cleanliness or age of the furnishings.The majority of the staff were very nice and pleasant with the exception of the young lady who was on the desk when we arrived after almost 24 hours travelling we found her to be very cold and un-welcoming. There is nowhere to sit in the evening to relax and have a chat or to sit and have a nice meal it is not somewhere we wanted to sit in very dark and miserable and old and antiquated. Ubud itself is very nice and has some wonderful things to see but not somewhere to stay for more than 2-3 nights and be very carelful about where you stay. We hired a car for the two weeks and enjoyed it very much my Husband found the whole experience of driving in Bali very different but he enjoyed it. By the time we had been there for 5 days they thought he was a local probably because he was driving like one!!.So all in all a wonderful holiday after we left the Waka Namya and had somewhere nice to stay that was clean bright and a very Modern Balinese feel.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR262155195", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "nannyhog"}, {"Content": "Over-rated and overpriced I booked the lanai room (L1) and asked to move the 2nd day. It was dark and noisy, being closest room to the kitchen and main road. The deluxe lanai was larger and more quiet, and share a semi-private pool with 4 similar rooms. Unlike the other rooms, the closet in the deluxe lanai is indoors (in the others, the closet is outside with bathroom and thus virtually unusable given the humidity). We had to move the last night to a 2-floor rice-paddy villa which was older in terms of decor and fixtures. Overall all though, the rooms are comfortable. The main pool is kept clean. Breakfast and menu selection/quality are decent. There is no wifi in the lobby which is a drag: if you have to check emails, you have to ask to use their computer and dial-up which is quite slow. At the price I paid (from $130 to $165 per room), I was expecting serenity once I crossed the gate. Unfortunately, that never happened. With a few exceptions the staff is constantly asking clients whether they have a program or not, obviously out to get a commission. It is relentless and at the rates charged it is inexcusable. To top it off, the staffer converted the USD rate I was quoted into rupiah using an incredible high rate. I argued and it was diminished slightly. What a way to end the stay!", "Date": "Jul 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551230546", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jacqueline_Cambodia"}, {"Content": "Wonderful This is the first time we have used trip advisor and after spending many hours reading through reveiws of hotels in Ubud we decided to stay at the Waka Namya for four nights.

We had a memorable stay. Everthing from the beds to the front lawn near the lobby was done with great detail. We stayed at 2 deluxe villas facing the swimming pool and it was the most comfortable room that I have ever stayed in all my travels. The rooms are huge and kept very clean. I particularly love the outdoor shower and the little details like the bottles of bath foam, shampoo and the baskets filled with clean towels. The staff were great. It was really hard to look for people who serve the guests with passion. Everyone was so helpful and very resourceful. Just ask anyone anything and they are able to give you the best tips and advice. The hotel staff love to interact with their guests. They seemed to be able to find time to sit and chat with you by the pool, restaurant even when they are busy making bedsor attending to guests calls. The free shuttle is very useful since the hotel is located slightly off the centre of Ubud. The service is very prompt too. Just call the front desk for a shuttle and the driver is at your service.The restaurant staff seems to know the time you arrive for breakfast. Everyday when we arrived at the restaurant, our table is already set, together with a baby high chair for our 1 1/2 year old daughter. We cannot recall a moment where we have to wait for our table. Everything was at our disposal the moment we step into the room. We enjoyed all the meals at Wakanamya. The menu was simple yet delicious. We weren't also be able to enjoy our meals if not for the staffs' patience in handling our 3 little children - at no charge. Ngurah, our children still remember you. I would strongly recommend Wakanamya to all families travelling to Bali. It is a very family friendly environment, safe, comfortable and indeed good value for money (it is true that we are paying for a 5 star service for a 3 star hotel). To all readers, go for Wakanamya. There is no need to think twice about it. God bless Wakanamya !", "Date": "Jul 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR498897726", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Merlion2007"}, {"Content": "Amazing Place       Entrance to our villa", "Date": "Jun 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR281022328", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "bbbs"}, {"Content": "Experience the real Bali at Waka Namya My mum and I stayed for three nights at Waka Namya in November 2006 on our way to visit family in Australia. Having not travelled further than Europe before we were keen to have some home comforts whilst being able to get a feel for the real Bali. At Waka Namya, we achieved everything and more that we wanted from our holiday. From the moment we arrived to the moment we stepped on the plane we were welcomed and looked after so well. The hotel itself is set in beautiful surroundings and the buildings are all designed using locally sourced materials in a traditional Balinese style. We stayed in a deluxe bulagalow, which had two storeys with two double beds. The open-air bathroom was an experience - and felt like we were really getting back to nature. All the rooms were kept very clean and the bottled drinking water was refreshed regularly. The swimming pool is quite large and very clean and is surrounding by comfortable sunbeds. We ate in the restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and beautifully presented. The spa was gorgeous and Minnie, my beautician, was very friendly and excellent at her job - it's definately worth a visit. Although there is a range of excursions organised by the hotel, mum and I wanted something more bespoke which the staff were very happy to offer. We had a guide and a driver for a whole afternoon at a very reasonable price and with their knowledge of the area, we were shown the most breathtaking views of the Ayung River, rice paddy fields and a spectacular waterfall - along the way meeting local villagers and very cute children. As the staff were so friendly, by talking to them we got to know about local customs, the Hindu traditions and the Balinese way of life and felt we really learnt something about the island. It was a delight and a pleasure to get to know some of the staff at Waka Namya and I will definately be visiting again.", "Date": "Dec 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR400338020", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "AmandaLondon"}, {"Content": "Comfort, culture and art Quiet boutique hotel in Penestanan, about a mile and a half from the centre of Ubud overlooking the rice paddies.

It was in one word- spectacular! The resort is just out of Ubud, although a shuttle service is provided free of charge by Waka Namya, so transprt is not a problem. It is clean, private, and absolutely gorgeous.We booked via direct contact with the resort on the internet, and because we were staying for our honeymoon, were upgraded from a Lanai to Deluxe Villa with a free Lingga and Yoni spa package and daily continental breakfast. All guests also recieve the free shuttle, use of the pool, a free rice paddy trek, free entry at a local gallery and 5 star service!Our villa was just magic, situated inside a private walled garden, it was double storey, with the master bedroom upstairs (gorgeous king size bed with mosquito net, candles and roses on the pillows) and a sprawling bathroom downstairs (including a large sunken bath and cute, private outdoor shower) Also downstairs was the entry type room, with a day bed, small table (set with the menu, fresh fruit and flowers) and a stocked up fridge.It was the little details though that really amazed me... the candles upstairs, the embroidered handmade sign about where to leave dirty towels, the little glass bottles full of shampoos, body lotions and bubble baths, with a cute rattan tie, and on our last night, a suprise honeymoon cake (tasted like heaven!)The staff at the Waka Namya are great, so friendly and eager to help out in any way they can. The manager, Gede, is a really great guy who loves to meet his guests. And any of the staff are happy to help out with suggestions on where to eat and shop in Ubud (and no, they dont suggest their great uncles restaraunt or grandmothers craft stall, they recommend nice quality places.)The massage/spa service is amazing, as mentioned, we got the Lingga and Yoni package which is a one hour massage/scrub/jacuzzi. It was honestly the best massage I have EVER had, the body scrub smelled great, and the milk bath jacuzzi was very relaxing.Finally, a word on the food at Waka Namya. Again, 10/10, everything we ate was fantastic. As I mentioned, we had the continental breakfast, (however I think they may call it the American breakfast on their menu) which was a FEAST, neither of us ate all of it. Included was tea and coffee, fresh juices, a bread basket (with crossoints amongst other things), a fresh fruit platter, eggs any style, sausages, bacon and a variety of sauces and spreads. One word of advice though, the coffee is Balinese, and is quite strong and not as smooth as most Aussies would be used to. Each day afternoon tea is provided free to all guests. This includes Javanese tea (very yummy) and Balinese cakes (VERY VERY yummy) and is served by the pool.We ate in the restaraunt one night and found the food to be delicious and quite reasonably priced (on par with other up market resteraunts in Ubud) The staff have good English and were able to understand changes we wished to be made to our meals.All up I was more than happy with our stay in Ubud. I would definitely recommend the Waka Namya to anyone visiting who is happy to pay that little bit more for absolute luxury. Our stay cost us about US $350 including taxes and everything I have mentioned except for the dinner.10/10", "Date": "Sep 10, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR674422866", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "em7"}, {"Content": "Little Gem of convenience near Ubud       Waka Namya Bathroom", "Date": "Sep 5, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR613553059", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "thaiflosdiner"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u64b1\u4ed2\u9288\u64b1\u4f28\u9288\u5a3f\u4ed0\u9287\u71bc\u4eb7\u9287\u65bb\u4ed0\u9288\u52e9\u4eda\u9287\u52e9\u5127\u9289\u55d0\u5137\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(22360736, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR529674399", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ApprenticeGardener"}, {"Content": "calme et charmant       la piscine cote villa", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR568761590", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tallieparis"}, {"Content": "Vacanza rilassante e di lusso       Il letto pronto per la notte", "Date": "Sep 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR432073157", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "francitrovato"}, {"Content": "\u9287\ue1ba\u5031\u9287\u70bd\u501e   showReview(19954979, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR507959690", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297695-d498939-r20460038-Waka_Namya_Resort_Spa-Gianyar_Bali.html", "HotelID": "498939", "Price": "$110"}}
