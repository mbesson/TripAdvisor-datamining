At the airport we were quoted 40 euros for a taxi to the hotel, so we binned that and got the bus which was a whopping 2 euros each!! The hotel is just off a main road and it seemed ok on arrival. The staff were polite and friendly and spoke good english. the reception area was clean and tidy and so was the room. although not spacious it was enough and the bathroom was nice and clean, the free mini bar being restocked daily was a bonus. one previous review said they had their money stolen. the answer to that is to get a safe deposit box from the reception. its free and its kept just at the side of the reception in a private room. we didnt eat breakfast at the hotel we decided to eat just up the road at tapa tapa. for the 2 of us breakfast usually came in at under a tenner. the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the metro station and take advantage of that, the service is superb and a 10 trip ticket is just over 9 euros, and its only 3 stops from la rambla! We stayed there for 4 nights and although its not bang in the centre of town the public transport makes it easy and cheap enough not to make it a hassle.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut Creek, California", "Title": "\u201cEasy Access from the airport\u201d", "Author": "HavingFunAbroad", "ReviewID": "UR126803646", "Content": "I stayed here for a night before a cruise, and I found this hotel very nice. The staff spoke English, which was greatly appreciated. Plus the hotel was very close to drop off point for the airport bus (the airport bus only has 3 drop offs). The front door to the hotel was locked at night, which made the hotel seem more secure, although we were not in a bad neighborhood. The staff was very accommodating and held our luggage during the day while we toured the city. The room was very clean, and this was one of the only hotels in the city that had a king size bed...not two twins pushed together. Finally, we were appreciative of the free nonalcoholic drinks in the minifridge....we were parched after flying and we drank everything, even though there was a lot of soda and water.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shropshire", "Title": "\u201cNot keen\u201d", "Author": "Shropshire_sun", "ReviewID": "UR123684564", "Content": "I was treated to a city break for my 30th and we stayed here. I can't comment on costs as I didn't pay but I got the impression it wasn't priced as a budget hotel. It made all the right noises in the foyer (most hotel's do though) the rooms however were a let down. The bathroom was impressive, huge walk in wet room with high quality fittings, the problem is that the bathroom was as big as the bedroom! The mattress was next to non existent and didn't get a decent nights sleep all break. Breakfast was just ok, to be honest, it was a decent guest house attempt at breakfast and not anything special. Location, location, location - I felt a little out of place, whilst we walked everywhere and didn't rely on taxi's, I felt at times that we were out of the thick of it and the area wasn't great either with graffiti all in the street outside (to be fair, Barcelona was covered in graffiti). I wouldn't recommend a stay here if you are travelling to Barcelona but I wouldn't try and put you off if you have already booked to go.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433", "Title": "\u201c\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438!

They made me wait till the last day and then simply said that they can't help me at the moment. They only said: \"We asked the room service, they told they didn't take it\". What a cynicism! Then at the reception they gave me the paper to write a complaint \"if I want to\" and said that in this case the manager would call me in 3 days. Of course, nobody called me.

It is not only close to the Fair grounds, but Airport takes max 30 Min by bus from Placa Espagna or downtown (University or Placa Catalunya) an be reached on foot within 15 Min or 3 stops by subway. Cafes and pastry shops within a stone throw make life easier if you do not want to spend the 15 euros on breakfast at hotel. Staff is very nice, minibar is complimentary. The floor in the bedroom are wooden, nice but loud at the same time-take your slippers with you... Room is clean, perfect for one person. The rooms go on the road, in the summer or warm weather it is not possible to sleep with open windows due to noise. Great feature is the free internet in Lobby/bar area. If I visit Barcelona next year for the fair, I will stay there again", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Vilamari", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d265742-Reviews-Hotel_Vilamari-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$96 - $222*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "265742", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b1/54/b154a5127c85631cedaf1649ee63d6a15large.jpg"}}
