I am pleased to tell you that it was far superior than I expected. Our room was very clean and updated with marble walls and granite surfaces in the bathroom as well as granite surfaces in the room itself. The shower was roomy, the water pressure high and the bed was SO comfy! I chose this hotel because I wanted a suite with two televisions so that my daughter could watch cartoons while I watched more adult-oriented fare. The television in the bedroom was a crisp flat-screen, but the second one in the living area was an older conventional style with less that stellar reception. But my daughter didn;t mind -- she was able to see her cartoons just fine. I don't know if all of the bathrooms in the hotel have sinks as low as ours was, but my daughter loved being able to use the sink herself without standing on her tippee toes. She's in kindergarten. I found it to be to low for an average sized adult, however. I used the small exercise room every day. It was equipped with a weight station, a step climber, a stationary bike and a treadmill. Although the stationary bike and the stair climber were in okay condition, all of the items in the room were a bit dated and the elevation mechanism on the treadmill was broken. There is a large TV in the room, a water dispenser, and a sauna across from the bathroom. Down the hallway is a small room with a pool table in it. The breakfast was the best I've had at a Best Western. In addition to a variety of breads, fruit and cereals, there was also single-serve wrapped english muffin and sausage sandwhiches in a warming oven along with hot, soft granola bars. We ate very well every morning. A particularly nice touch was the warm cookies that were set out for guests in the afternoon. The hotel staff were exceptionally nice. My rental car broke down as we were leaving to go to lunch. As we waited in the lobby the receptionist brought my daughter water and heated-up english muffin egg and cheese sandwich. I visit Los Angeles every year and this is the fourth hotel I've stayed at in four years. From now on I will always stay here. For just over $100 you get free high speed internet, a swimming pool, a hot tub, an exercise room, a good breakfast, free parking and nicely updated rooms with very comfortable beds -- WOW!

The bathroom was clean but very very small - no counter space! And the shower was just plain weird (no tub) but clean. The bedspreads (we had 2 beds) did not look that clean, so I examined the blankets and sheets closely. Found a few gray hair in the blankets! Yup. Sure did.

The breakfast was buffet style and consisted of bread and bagels which you can toast yourself, pasties, hard boiled eggs, juice, coffee & tea. Although it wasn't the greatest, it was good to have. In the evening they serve fresh baked Otis Spunkmeyer cookies, and we enjoyed them, of course. The parking was not too bad, but the spaces are small and narrow. The hotel was not full that week so we always found a space, but it would be hard if it were full. The pool was very small and didn't look that clean so we never used it.

There are two parking lots, one is above ground and has about eight spots. It's a dead end lot so while getting in can be doable, getting out is a mess, as you have to manuever the other cars as well as the uncomfortably close walls of the hotel. Once you leave, you have to go out on to a busy street and your view will be blocked on both sides by the lucky guests who were able to find street parking. If you have to park in the underground lot, you have to manuever through other cars, poles, garbage, the ceiling (!), as well as the unsafely steep one way ramp that leads down to the parking structure. If you are entering when someone else is trying to exit, you'll either have to reverse up a narrow hill with walls on both sides or hope the other person will reverse downhill into parked cars. It's going to be an accident either way so just hope for the best.

Okay, just got back from a 3-night stay at this motel. Let me first say that it is very convenient to many things, and is just a few blocks off of I-10. Not in the best neighborhood in the world, but still, relatively convenient. The front desk staff was nice when we checked in, and explained everything, as well as the free continental breakfast and where to park, and the best places to get to your room. Let me move right on to parking........as others have mentioned, it is HORRIBLE. We were driving a minivan, and were basically excluded from parking underground because they said our van wouldn't fit. There is a small amount of parking in front of the hotel, which is very tight. However, there's also a small parking area to the south of the hotel...a little bigger, but also very hard to manuever with a van. Parking is limited, so you'd better be back by about 7 pm! Otherwise, you'll have to spend a night parking on the street like we did. So...taking our keys, and having parked our car, we walk up to our room...a \"suite\". TINY! We had two queen beds in the sleeping room, and an additional room tacked on with a tv, couch, refridgerater, and microwave. The additional room couldn't have been more than 10ftx10ft. Although, we found we needed it so we'd have room for a suitcase or two as there isn't much room in the sleeping room for anything other than the beds, desk, and tv. One of the smallest rooms I've honestly seen. The air conditioning placement is HORRIBLE......right under the window, next to one bed. It's impossible to have the room cool without turning it on high at the coldest setting. It doesn't shut on or off by itself, so you have to leave it on high all night.......which means that the unlucky person (me) sleeping in the bed next to it gets an icy wind blown on them all night. The bathroom........................THE-SMALLEST-BATHROOM-IN-THE-UNIVERSE! And horribly constructed. First of all, the sink is short enough to comfortably accomodate a midget. There is enough counter space to maybe, just maybe store a tube of toothpaste on it. Oh, and I LOVE how the faucet is on the side of the sink....right next to an electrical outlet that has the hairdryer plugged into it. The shower is rediculous! Not only is it tiny, with ever changing water temperatures.......it also has a bizarre step in one corner that prevents anything but your head being hit by the water. Why they have this step area is beyond me. It prevents you from using that corner of the shower, which is needed. So, ladies, trying to shave your legs with the foam of your soap is impossible because a stream of water from the shower hitting your head drains down and rinses the soap off as soon as you lather it on....not to mention, you must fight with the shower curtain sticking to you the entire time. The lighting in the bathroom is horrible....there's a heat lamp that makes it intollerable when on after a shower because of the heat and humidity. The only other light is a florescent light, which makes you look horrible even with the best makeup job. The towel racks are placed right over the toilet, which is really dumb. We even had an incident where a washcloth fell into the toilet. Needless to say, we didn't realize this until a member of our party used the toilet and it tried to overflow when she flushed (luckily she thought to turn off the water...I can't imagine the mess if she hadn't done this). So, we called for maintenance. Apparently, there was \"nobody on property to help us........but we have a plunger you can use\". So, to make the long story short, WE got the toilet fixed and WE fished out the toilet water washcloth and threw it away. What a horrible place to put towel racks. The absolute only counter space is also located directly above the toilet. Needless to say, we kept the toilet seat down out of fear that a personal item would fall into the great beyond. Hmmm.........let's see....a good thing...quite a nice sized balcony. It looks out over the road, and the traffic didn't bother us. Housekeeping always seemed very good. We never really ran into any staff, but the room was always cleaned very nicely. The hotel does have a continental breakfast daily 7am-10am. They have cheerios, corn flakes, bagels, toast, coffee, juice, fruit, and tea. There's a computer in the lobby which I didn't use. There's a bunch of brochures in the lobby which is very helpful. The hotel does have a pool and jacuzzi, which both are pretty small, especially the pool. Neither looked appetizing at all to me. So................the wrap-up.........................we won't be back. The hotel is just too frustrating. There's more negatives than benefits. I just didn't like it, and couldn't wait to leave. Yes, it's cheap, but you could find much better hotels for the exact same price.
