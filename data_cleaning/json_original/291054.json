If you want only 5 star amenities then either stay home or pay big bucks. it is not in a seedy area, it was safe, clean and accessible. Being close to Termini train station is key. If you need to take the subway to get around it is easily accessible. The breakfast was typical European style including coffee and croissant. There was a street market every day on the same street of the hotel until 1 pm. Here you can shop buy fruit and browse. You have a coffee shop right downstairs, a great restaurant accross the street called Steak House. This is very convenient after a full day of sites and if you are tired. Great pizza by the slice at 3p down the street also. Only recommendation is if you think of sharing a room with 4 adults it is tight when you factor in at least 3 suitcases. I recommend 2 per room. We had 2 children with us ages 10 and 11 and they had bunk beds in our room and we had a king size bed. It was great. However, our other group of 4 adults were a little tight since rooms are so small. Price is so good its worth having 2 rooms for 4 adults. I would go back any time and I would recommend it and already have. Thanks for a great time to Hotel Virginia and Rome.

Fortunately, there is a supermarket nearby, very close to Piazza Indipendenza (as you walk out of the hotel, turn left to the next junction, and then left again and walk for 3-4 minutes - you'll see it to the rigth). One annoying thing about this hotel was the fact that on making the reservation we clearly asked for a quiet room. We were given one that was exactly at the corner of the two streets the hotel is located at, just above the restaurant on the ground floor, and - which was most annoying - our room was just close to the reception room.
