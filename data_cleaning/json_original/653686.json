The details of my previous reviews still apply but with the following observations. Reception staff were pleasant, cooperative, helpful and responsive. We had our preferred room on the top floor facing the back and farthest from the lift-elevator. Unfortunately, a large air conditioning unit on the top of a building opposite operated between about 6-7 a.m. and the noise entered the room. The hotel gave us another room facing the front, but this admitted some street noise. If you can run the air conditioning unit, the three-speed fan covers these minor outside noises. Unfortunately, the system was set for winter, that is, heating only from November to March, inclusive. (The hotel system is changed at some point to cooling over summer, April to October, inclusive.) Thus, during our stay we could have heating only (which was unneeded at the time) either on or off. There was no option for simple ventilation, that is, room air circulation without either heating or cooling. The thermostat dial, marked in degrees centigrade, had no discernable effect regardless of the temperature we selected. This meant that, if the room became too hot, the only feasible option was to open the window. The practicality of this choice depended on one's sensitivity to and the volume of outside noises. If you might be easily disturbed by outside noise, try to get a room as high up as possible and facing away from street activities. Should you take a taxi to Barajas airport, consult reception and have the driver agree on the route before you leave the hotel \u2014 or you might be taken on a longer ride than necessary so that the driver can increase the tariff. (This also happened to us in Lisbon; the driver contemptuously ignored the map I gave him showing the route I wanted him to take.) The airport is a short drive from the hotel, and easily reached by going along Calle de Acala (at the top of Calle de Valentin Beato) \u2014 which reaches and then parallels Avenida de America \u2014 to Autovia M-22 and Autovia de Acceso al Aeropuerto de Barajas (or the airport service road which parallels them). If the taxi driver proceeds down Calle de Valentin Beato away from Calle de Acala, turns left at the end into Calle de Albasanz and proceeds along various roads till you see a stadium (Estadio La Peineta) in the distance to your left, you will know that he is taking a longer route than necessary. Compared to taking the train and then the bus, the short taxi trip is expensive: in addition to the meter charge for the actual trip, before you get into the vehicle there is an initial charge of 6.35 euros plus 5 euros airport charge for each passenger when you arrive at the airport terminal. In all, the fare for our brief, circuitous trip, with almost no other traffic as it was early morning, came to 24.95 euros (about $33). If you can manage your luggage using public transport, use the metro to Canillejas and then the 200 bus to the airport. With advance reservation, car rental for a day could cost less than a taxi fare. Street parking during the workday remains impractical because of the commercial activities in the surrounding area. Parking on the hotel property is 7 euros per night. Also, the hotel charges 5 euros per day for use of WiFi room Internet; however, the first 20 minutes use of the hotel computer in the lobby are free. It really is time that the entire Ibis chain has its room tariffs include WiFi Internet service at no extra charge, as do other hotel chains.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "istanbul", "Title": "\u201cnice location\u201d", "Author": "teote", "ReviewID": "UR130616956", "Content": "According to the Ibis standarts.

The bathroom was impeccable clean, so was the room. Very comfortable mattress. A minus for the air conditioning, which is not very efficient at night, and the Madrid nights are quite hot in end June. Too many local TV channels compared to international ones. We like to see some global news at the end of the day and the management of the hotel has more to work on that. The breakfast was satisfactory, somehow lacking the vegetables (was it because we were in the middle of the E. Coli epidemic scandal or is the usual?) The coffee is undrinkable, but after the Barcelona experience I began to think this is a general situation all over Spain. The location of the hotel is good, surrounded by almost empty office buildings, car dealers with no customers, a large park nearby and a metro station that will get you to city center in 15 minutes. Best access to/from airport is by taxi as it will cost just 10-12 euros and will take only 10 minutes. The staff at the reception speak English and was helpful in providing us with free city and metro maps and pointed on these the main tourist attractions. Tourist reccomendations for Madrid: Prado Museum: allow at least a full day. Most impressed by the paintings: \"Dead Christ Supported by an Angel\" by Antonello da Messina, \" Annunciation \" by Fra Angelico and the dark period of Goya. Las Ventas: must see a bull fight if you are not a hypocrite who claims animal rights and have a large steak for dinner. The matadors are brave, elegant and risk their life every second. Royal Palace: royal armory Escorial trip: closed on Monday Toledo trip: allow at least 1 1/2 hours to buy the train tickets at Atocha Station. Long waiting rows, few vendors and no machine vending tickets. It is stupid to wait 2 hours to get the tickets for a one hour trip!

The details of my previous review still apply but with the following changes. The conduct of the staff at reception has improved. Fabrizio O. who checked us in was exceptionally pleasant, helpful and cooperative, and also his colleague Ana. He assigned to us exactly the type of room that we prefer and obtained information and travel directions to a particular location that we had wanted to visit. The hotel restaurant had a E13.75 fixed-price menu (we did not eat there). This consists of one appetizer or one dessert, one dish of the day and one drink from a choice of mineral water or a class of wine or a beer or a soft drink. For the price, you can do better elsewhere with a \"menu del dia\" which can have a lower price and give you more choice and quantity. The E6.50 fixed-price breakfast buffet was available from 6:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (with a simpler breakfast available earlier than the buffet). The air conditioning was set for winter, that is, heating only from November to April, inclusive. (The hotel system is changed to cooling over summer, May to October, inclusive.) Thus, during our stay we could have heating only \u2014 which was unneeded at the time \u2014 either on or off. There was no option for simple ventilation, that is, room air circulation without either heating or cooling. The thermostat dial, marked in degrees centigrade, had no discernable effect regardless of the temperature we selected. This meant that, if the room became to hot, the only feasible option was to open the window. Quieter rooms are at the back facing away from the front of the hotel and the street. Covered parking on the hotel property costs E7 per night, but you can find free street parking. Since the hotel is in a commercial area with car sales, maintenance and repair shops and offices, parking space outside business hours is quite easy to find but much less so when all the offices and shops are open and fully operating. The number 200 bus serves all four terminals of the Madrid Barajas airport. Now when you get off at the bus stop for Canillejas metro station (and go to Suanzes station a short walk to the Ibis), you can cross the street directly at two sets of traffic lights to get to the entrance to the station. (You no longer have to take the pedestrian bridge to get across.) The 200 bus from Canillejas going to the airport leaves from the bus shelters at the far edge of the open bus plaza. Note that the mezzanine (middle) level of the metro station provides direct access to the bus plaza. The top-level exit comes out across the street from the bus plaza. A bus-train ticket with ten trips now costs E9.30 (appealing more for convenience than great savings). There is still an additional E1 supplement because the airport is in the next fare zone. Note that there is no transfer facility between the two modes of transport, so a trip between the hotel and airport currently costs E3 (E1 for the bus, E1 for the metro and E1 for the supplement). Tickets are available from multilingual touch-screen vending machines in the basement (-1 level) of the terminal. The bus leaves from (and arrives at) the ground (0 level). You can buy Abono Turistico tickets for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days of unlimited travel over zones A (Madrid city area) and T (regional beyond the city). If you expect to use public transport extensively for sightseeing, these tickets are worth considering. From the hotel you can easily get to a centro comercial with a Carrefour at Avenida de Guadalajara 2. (The building had a sign saying that Carrefour was open 24 hours a day; however, you might want to check. especially on Sundays. Usually Carrefours are open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., closed on Sundays.) Take the metro to Ventas station and change to Line 2 which now finishes not La Elipa but at Las Rosas (one of four new stations at the time of writing this, so they will not appear on metro maps earlier than Marzo 2011/2). Get off at Alsacia station and the centro is across the street from the exit. It also has a McDonalds with free WiFi. The VIP restaurant at the centro also has free WiFi. The restaurant El Castillio on Calle Augusto Figueroa 8 that I suggested in my December 2011 review has, unfortunately, closed (a pity as the couple who ran it served simple but good regional home cooking). As alternatives I suggest your trying nearby Vivares at Calle Hortaleza 37 (there is another Vivares across the street at 52). They have fixed-price menus (E9.60, E11.90 and E12.90, depending on the dishes offered) for complete meals with a choice of beverage included (two people can share a 750 ml bottle of wine). The service was good and the food reasonable in quality, quantity and presentation. If you are near Plaza Calao, Topolino at Plaza Santo Domingo offers a E8.90 buffet, excluding beverages. The choice and quality of the food was supposedly Italian but reasonable all things considered. On a lane, Calle de Caballero de Gracia, just off the Gran Via metro station at the top of Calle de la Montera leading to Plaza Sol, there is a Chinese buffet and near it a Fres Co buffet.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgood\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR105849848", "Content": "We had a difficulty finding the hotel and when we finally found it we hadn't realized that one of the rooms (I booked 2 rooms)only had one bed.

It's within about 100 metres of a metro stop, in a decent area to the NE of the city centre - about 30 minutes from Atocha RENFE and a 15/20 minute taxi ride from the airport. We used it for the first night of an InterRail trip and the room was ideal as it had plenty of space/surfaces for repacking rucsacs!", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Appartement , Gent, Belgium , Europe", "Title": "\u201cGood service , neat accom and nice area\u201d", "Author": "joris_de_groote", "ReviewID": "UR42241017", "Content": "Positive: Staff were very friendly ; hotel had neat rooms and in the bar a bottle of water costs just 1.7 euro .

Car repair shops line the street, so that during business hours it has lots of parked vehicles; outside business hours you will find the area deserted. The newspaper El Pais has production facilities at the far end of the street. The few restaurants in the general area seem to function according to the opening hours of local businesses (otherwise, no customers). We chose this hotel for its convenience to Suanzes metro station and its reasonable price (given the current decline of the U.S. dollar). We would probably return to stay again. The station provides easy access to central Madrid (15-20 minutes) and to Terminals 1, 2 and 3 of Barajas airport (30-35 minutes). The five-story hotel (with pay parking) lies a very brief walk up the street from the station (1-2 minutes). It provides a base for going out sightseeing rather than a place to vacation in itself. If you take the metro to Suanzes, as you approach the doors which access stairs to the street leave from the side where the sign says \u201cPares\u201d; otherwise, you will emerge on the side of the main street with a large park. Valentin Beato is at the nearby corner at the side of a Land Rover dealership; walk toward the \u201cP\u201d sign in the distance, as the hotel sits back from the street. We found the hotel desk staff polite, efficient and cooperative \u2014 but business-like. On all the occasions we encountered, at least one staff member spoke English or French. Internet connection using the hotel\u2019s desktop computer in the lobby or your laptop costs, as do phone calls. The small, cramped lounge area near the hotel entrance has a rack with current Spanish newspapers. The rooms have light-wood, built-in contemporary furniture, platform beds and parquet wood floors (for ease of cleaning). Yes, you can hear footsteps from adjoining rooms; however, the limited free floor space means that you will most likely hear a cleaner servicing a room in the morning rather than another guest at night. (It would help us jet-lagged and late risers if the cleaning staff wore soft-soled slippers as they went about their work; better still, Accor should carpet the rooms.) The modern, spacious bathroom provided a shower (but not a bathtub), liquid soap exclusively, two towels and a bath mat. The room had a heavy, solid door which closed tightly onto its frame, which ran across the floor as well, and had a surrounding rubber seal. (I wish that U.S. hotels standardized on this type of door and frame.) Coupled with carpeting in the corridor, we did not hear any noise from outside the door. The top, fourth floor, has the quietest rooms because you will not have anyone above. You might want to avoid rooms nearest the elevator; also, the cleaners have their trolleys and supplies in a room to the side. Room 420 at one end of the corridor faces away from the street; room 421 opposite it faces the street. Room 431 at the other end of the corridor faces away from the street; room 430 opposite it faces the street. These last two rooms have a separate door at the end of the corridor which isolates them even further, and serves to make them equivalent to adjoining rooms for a family. If you arrive at Terminal T1, after passing through passport control and customs go to the tourist information kiosk. Obtain street and metro maps and information on museums, art galleries, shopping and the like. We encountered a pleasant woman who spoke English and provided useful literature from the shelves to which only she had access. Madrid has a superb metro and bus system \u2014 modern, comprehensive, frequent, safe, clean and operating till late. Check whether you have an up-to-date metro map, as lots of them still in circulation omit new stations along extended lines. For instance, Line 5, green, serving Suanzes station and thus the hotel, now ends at Alameda de Osuna (near the airport) not at Canillejas (construction of its extension continues and it will probably reach the station at Terminal 2 at some point in the near future). Line 10, dark blue, now ends at Hospital del Norte not at Herrera Oria. Using the moving footways, walk to Terminal T2 which has the metro station. (Note that walking to the metro station in T2 and then finding the bus stop might take a bit of wandering around. If you need to, ask for directions at any information counter; usually someone speaks English.) From a vending machine with a touch screen, buy a \u201cBono de 10 Viajes\u201d (10-trip ticket) for 6.40 euros (at the time of writing). Note that from and to the airport you have to pay a 1 euro supplement per person, as the airport terminals lie in the next fare zone. The machine also has a touch-screen button for the supplement. Go outside to the bus stop across the road for the Linea 200 bus and take it to Canillejas. (On a bus and in a metro station, you feed the ticket into a lower slot on a reader and retrieve it from an upper slot. Several people can use the same ticket as long as each person passes it through the machine reader.) The bus has racks for luggage. Check that the visual display announcing the next stop works, and press one of the buttons near the exit door in the middle of the bus to request the stop; otherwise, the driver will speed by. If the display does not work, ensure that the driver knows clearly that you want to get off at Canillejas. When you alight from the bus, cross over the road to Canillejas metro station using the pedestrian footbridge over the highway. Lonely Planet and Time Out have the best guides to Madrid in English. Buy before you leave home, as you will pay more for them in Spain. Also, from a Madrid newsagent buy a Guia del Ocio (a weekly) and a copy of El Pais (a daily) to check the hours of opening (or if open at all) of places you would like to visit.
