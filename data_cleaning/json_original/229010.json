The location is not great, and the neighbouring area is very uninspiring. The shuttlebus which was at least an attempt to mitigate this was too often full. They should either have a larger vehicle or have an extra one to increase the frequency (perhaps to another drop off point as well??). We ended up having to use taxis 80% of the time regardless. The rooms are not great, very tired looking and small. Breakfast was a non-event, stale bread and cakes from previous day always available. The high chair we used always came back to us every morning filthy from previous use, they couldn't even bother to wipe it down after others had used it. We would it clean it before and after using it and it would always come back dirty... very lazy service. Coffee is dreadful, juice is from a carton. Unfortunately nowhere obvious to go nearby as an alternative, only positive was that breakfast was incl in the rate Receptionist quality varied. Some where helpful some seemed greatly disinterested. On check out we arrived 30mins before our car pick up to settle the bill, but there was no recpetionist 'qualified' to do the check out \"back in 5mins\" we were told.... 20mins later we ask what's going on, and she calls the guy who was just next door! We then have issues with the payment due to the card and we are suddenly stressing to leave on time as planned, all because of this. There should ALWAYS be someone to do checkouts at a hotel reception 24/7 We booked a car to take us to the airport (EUR65 service) who when we arrived had a child seat for our baby daughter. When we left however we also booked a car, but the recpetionists couldn't be bothered to call us and confirm the booking had been made. Despite reminding them we had a daughter and needed a child seat (most hotels know if you have a child with you regardless either by looking at your booking or by being just the slightest bit attentive when they see you everyday), however the hotel had not remebered to add the child seat to the booking for the 40min drive to the airport.

We ended up booking a Family Room through Hotels.com, which on their site claims there are two double beds and two twin beds, and \"Rich red furnishings on the 6th floor room.\" When we arrived, we were booked into the very dark 4th floor rooms (next to a screaming child), where we discovered two beds in the two adjoining rooms -- no twins. When I discussed this with the front desk, they claimed that there was no such room at the hotel. Taking this up with Hotels.com ( if anyone has ever tried to resolve something with them, I feel your pain) on the third call they said they were in contact with the hotel, and the hotel would not release us from the booking without charging us for 2 nights. So terrible service aside, let me comment about the rooms. Small. Dark. With a bathroom that is so small you have to turn sideways to get past the sink. The location -- way out of town, in a modern, charmless residential neighborhood. I hope the sites touting this hotel actually come visit the Duke, and take a test drive.

Two staff members stand out because of their friendliness and their helpful attitudes. The front desk folks were, in general, very helpful. However, Alessandro Biavati was particularly helpful. He was very enthusiastic and friendly. He always had a smile on his face and made an enthusiastic effort to be helpful whenever we asked a question on any topic during our stay. ranging from printing maps to restaurants to helping with printing boarding passes for our flight out of Rome. Never once did I feel that he was annoyed by our requests or questions. He was eager to help. Marco Di Pardo (I think), the staff person in the Polo Lounge for most of the week, was equally helpful and friendly. He also had no issues communicating with us in English. He gave us great advice and helpful hints on life in Rome in general. Francesco, in the Polo Lounge at the end of the week, was also friendly, sincere and helpful. Again, no hesitation to communicate with us in English. The breakfast staff was friendly and polite as well. I do have some criticism of the hotel. The lack of patio furniture on the balconies. It would have been nice to sit out on the balcony with a glass of wine and reflect on what we had visited during the day. And, one of the front desk individuals, (not Massimo who was the reason we selected the hotel in the first place based on Internet reviews. He lived up to those glowing reviews), was not particularly friendly and I did not get his name. I didn\u2019t see him anymore after midweek. Also, the immediate area around the hotel is a bit run down so to speak. Not the fault of the hotel. But, there's a nice little grocery two store fronts down which can provide nice cold cuts and cheeses, inexpensive wines, etc. for snacks and such. They too were friendly and helpful. If any friends are traveling to Rome in the future, I would enthusiastically recommend The Duke. The rooms and property are very nice. The staff is the best that I\u2019ve ever experienced in my travels. We were a group of Americans who could barely say \u201cboungiorno,\u201d much less communicate in any meaningful way in Italian with the staff in an unfamiliar big city.

He constantly showed various unhappy signs and was very rude throughout the registration period and wasn't very keen to explain the information we enquired. On the check-out day, Fabio was at the check-out desk and we went through the payment procedure. Earlier yesterday, we booked the free shuttle for 9AM in the morning and we needed it on time because we had to get to the airport. The driver wasn't there at about 9.10AM so we had to ask Fabio to ring the driver. He did not do as we told and only assured ''he is coming soon''. We asked again if the driver was coming, and he finally picked up the phone and started shouting on the phone about the driver's whereabouts. The driver was late for 20mins and did not express any apologies. We were lucky we managed to catch our bus at theTermini (just in there) to the airport.

What we found surpised us, but in a good way; the rooms were clean and large with seperate wardrobe, the shuttle bus was excellent as long as you booked in advance, even when it was booked up the front desk went out of their way to help you i.e they would put an additional time on or drop you to another location such as the Vatican, although we initially found front desk to be rather rude, as the days went on, I put this down to their inability to cope when it was hectic. When things were quieter, they found time to help guide us, and look after us, which meant they were consciencious about the guests although just couldn't handle it when it was busy. We both felt that for the money we paid (we got a deal off Voyage Prive), the shuttle bus making up for the location, all in all we were rather satisfied.

Unfortunately for us, it was my first visit to Rome (my husband had been previously). Of course I wanted to visit the Colosseum, Vatican, Spanish Steps and all the other main attractions of Rome... The location of the Duke Hotel is very inconvenient for travelers wanting to see and experience the main attractions, most of which are in/near the heart of the city. The Duke Hotel, however, sits on the outskirts of the city (in a residential area) and requires a drive that takes anywhere from 10-40 minutes depending on the traffic due to rush hour, road blocks, etc. (A ten minute drive cost us about 10 Euros, just to give you an idea of the cost.) The Duke does provide a complimentary \"shuttle\" but it only can take 7 people at a time and you need to make a reservation for the shuttle for both your transport into the city and back to the hotel. This was fine for our morning ride into the city, but difficult for our ride back as we often did not know what time we would be ready to head back to the hotel. Worrying that we were going to miss our shuttle back to the hotel became something we basically wrote off and just started taking taxis if necessary. We were also told by the concierge that if we showed up at the pick up location without a reservation, it was likely that we would not be allowed on due to other guests' reservations... In sum, I would say the hotel's major downfall was its location. And just as a side note, I was not wholly impressed with the room - it was small, wood floor, with a bed that could not have been any firmer. Due to the wood floors, every night (or early morning, I should say) we could hear the people on the floor above us come home and walk around until they took their shoes off. This definitely has a B&B feel, rather than \"luxury\" hotel. However, all that said, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (especially Luigi!!! We loved Luigi!). The Duke provided a beautiful breakfast every morning that was included with the room. But when it comes down it, the location kills this hotel if you plan on spending time seeing Rome and all of its amazing sights. (While walking back to the shuttle pick-up location, we decided the next time we visit, we'll stay at the Eden Hotel, Intercontinental, or even the Westin that was not too far from the city center.

The shuttle drop-off is an easy walk to the Spanish Steps, Via Veneto, and the Trevi Fountain. We may have had better luck booking the shuttle than others, as the hotel was so quiet when we were there (I believe they only had 46 people in total booked). The service was excellent throughout our stay. The staff were always helpful, calling restaurants on our behalf to confirm whether they were open (many restaurants were closed for 2 weeks in August).

The hotel is in a lovely location, albiet of the beaten path. The complimetary shuttle helps greatly, but it would be nice to have had a few restaurants nearby. The deli next door helped on nights we did not feel like treking back into town to eat. We had two main problems with this hotel, the first was they advertise on their website, that their rooms are air conditioned and also that they have a lounge area with a nightly piano bar. What they don't say is that both of these ammenities are seasonal. This should absolutley be disclosed. If you are expecting something and do not receive it is where the problem lies. The second problem was the house keeping. The rooms definately needed a bit of an overhall. Our bedspread had a disgusting white stain on the underside and promptly went off the bed never to return. The bed was not comfortable, and the two twins that they put together to make a king were not the same height, so we kept rolling off into the center. Not once did we receive a clean glass(beverages were not even rinsed out) and the towels were just put back on the rack each night. (I know this because there was the same makeup stain on my towel the entire stay). I did leave a note in Italian after about 3days with no clean glasses and did receive for that day only. The next day it was back to dirty glasses with water or wine still left in them. Over all, this is not a bad property.

We were allocated a room with an adjoining door to the next room which unfortunately was occupied by younger guests who played their tv at a loud volume each night into the early hours of the morning. We did ask the hotel staff to intervene but their attitude to our complaint was very poor and when we requested a change of room the next morning, the Hotel Manager stated they were unable to move us as the hotel was fully booked. Unfortunatey we spent the following night wearing earplugs as a group of Italian guests decided to have an impromtu party in their room on the floor below which also carried on until the early hours. We can appreciate that our stay coincided with the New Year period, however we were very disappointed that the hotel staff did not take our noise complaints more seriously. Our hotel room was actually of a good size, very clean and comfortable (although the bed was quite hard). The bathroom was relatively modern and the shower, despite being over the bath, was good. We didn't actually eat at the hotel in the evening, choosing instead to eat in town. However, we had breakfast in the hotel on one morning and found it to be of a good standard with helpful waiting staff. The shuttle bus was extremely handy as the hotel is slightly out of town and it's a fair walk back at the end of a tiring day sightseeing. The shuttle bus drivers were friendly and courteous and the service generally ran on time. The bus runs every 45 mins into the town and stops at 22.00 at night, which is ideal if you choose to stay in town for an evening meal. Overall, our main disappointment with the Duke Hotel was two-fold. 1) that the rooms had extremely poor sound proofing to the extent that (in addition to tv noise) you could hear guests in the rooms below and above us opening their wardrobe doors and drawers. You could also hear the guests in the room above walking around as it appears that their bedroom, like ours, had wooden floors. 2) We strongly feel that our complaints were not resolved in an appropriate manner by the hotel reception staff and we spent 2 nights of our 3 night stay having very poor sleep.

We had the same issue as other travelers. This hotel is in a residential area. There supposedly is a train station close - - but it has been closed for construction for awhile so that wasn't an option. The shuttle to the \"Spainish steps\" drops you off at a not too convenient spot. I agree that they need MORE SHUTTLES and more drop off points to really accomodate city tourists. We ended up doing taxi's - - too expensive. If you leave the hotel in the morning and don't return till late maybe it's ok but if you want to come \"home\" and refresh or dress up for dinner, then you need another round trip taxi ride. The front desk only seemed to have one local restaurnt to refer us too - and half of it was filled with Duke guests. The meal was ok...but you would want more than one choice for a multiple night stay. Also - while we were there, there was construction nearby so the \" quiet residential neighborhood\" wasn't an offsetting perk. Our rooms were a decent size had little balconies - - but no table or chairs....odd. Mattress and bedding could have been better - - but I've had worse in similiar hotels in Europe. Breakfast was a plus - nice selection. Front desk staff were very accomodating.....but very busy and had to wait awhile a few times to get assistance. Wi-Fi was another issue. They say they offer it free in the business center. Well, the \"business center\" is a conference room alcove with one computer. And, if the room is booked for a meeting, you can't get access to the computer - - even if the meeting is out for lunch. (they block the computer from use). In short, our Rome experience would have been more fun if we were closer to the action - - even if it was a little louder!!

If you want to be in the middle of everything (which I hear is incredibly noisy), then I would not recommend this hotel only because of the location. We got a great rate on this hotel, and the breakfast alone probably saved us upwards of $30 a day. They really had great food at the buffet and it was nice to fill up for a long day of sightseeing. This was definitely one of the biggest perks to staying here. The free shuttle will drop you off at one of the best hotels in Rome, a block from the Spanish steps. We also experimented with walking through Villa Borghese and heading west of Popolo to get to the Vatican, which was a lovely walk and we got to see some less touristy areas of Rome.

The Bad: Wifi isn't free, but there is a pretty good business center up on the 5th floor.

We liked the hotel, however, we're not sure we'd stay there again. Our main concern was the location of the hotel. Yes, they do offer a free shuttle service. But with some bad luck, the shuttle will leave without you and will keep you waiting for it for as long as you like. On the first night we booked it (the last shuttle which is 10pm), it simply left without us. We waited for almost 30 minutes before we called the hotel and asked what happened. We found out that the driver took someone else in our place, a couple who probably was late for the previous shuttle. And no, we weren't late, they simply left earier because the bus was full. They sent the guy back but it meant another 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot. On the second night it almost happened again, as there was 1 person too much waiting for the shuttle. So had we come on time, they would have left without us but since we were there 10 minutes earlier we \"got lucky\"... We also regreted that the last shuttle to the hotel left at 10pm, which meant that we always had to control the time during the dinner. Sure, you can take the metro and then walk from Flaminio station but seriously, after 10-12h walking we did every day, we didn't feel like it. The taxi from the center to the hotel costs app. 15-20 Euros. So the shuttle was the best option, but we didn't like being so dependent from it. Other than that, the hotel was pleasant. We loved the breakfast, the delicious coffee, the fluffy, thick towels in the bathroom, the bed so huge you could get lost in it. The room was spotless and was cleaned every day. The marble bathroom was nice and large, I'm not a fan of the tub/shower combo though and disliked showering in the pretty narrow bathtub while touching that hanging cloth (well, at least it wasn't plastic) all the time. We booked a Superior Room and I really hoped for a normal shower. The water pressure was really good though. The TV didn't offer too many chanels, and for those whose Italian is not fluent only 2 or 3 news channels in English and French. I also had to get used to sleeping under the bedspread which in my eyes might be okay at home, but I really dislike it in hotels. Last but not least: our impression on the last day was that the only free things in this hotel are the breakfast (unless you want it in your room), the shuttle and the candy on the pillows. Everything else, from the WiFi (6 Euros per hour) through the mini bar to the shuttle to Fiumicino (65 Euros) is pricey. Getting an iron is not possible, you need to use the washing/pressing service of the hotel. We probably won't stay there again. The hotel is pleasant but we're sure that Rome offers many equally pleasant hotels that are much more central.", "Date": "October 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall, England", "Title": "\u201cHoneymoon heaven!\u201d", "Author": "CornishLulu", "ReviewID": "UR20668871", "Content": "The Duke Hotel describes itself as \u2018Your home in Rome\u2019 and we were certainly made to feel very welcome during our stay.

Our booking was for our honeymoon and the hotel definitely contributed to us having a trip of a lifetime in Rome. All of the staff (even our chambermaid!) spoke excellent English and were very friendly.

The Duke\u2019s breakfasts certainly set up for our busy days of sight seeing. We found the hotel\u2019s Mercedes mini bus shuttle to be very convenient. We pre-booked each day and found the trips very entertaining thanks to our lovely driver Luigi. Although there aren\u2019t any good places to eat or explore close to the hotel the free shuttle bus meant that the location wasn\u2019t a problem and if anything was an advantage as the suburbs are very quiet and it was good to get away from the noise of the busy city.

We would also recommend pre-booking a transfer from the airport rather than trying to access public transport or chancing it with a taxi.

Expedia was offering a terrific rate for a junior suite at the Duke Hotel, about which I had remembered reading rave reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. The room was stylishly appointed, light, and very comfortable. The concierge booked us into a quite good restaurant in the neighborhood called Pagaroma. The shuttle bus transported us there for free. One thing that I quite liked about this restaurant was that the only tourists eating there that night seemed to be from the Duke Hotel. (I know this because we encountered most of them the next morning at breakfast.) Everyone else appeared to be real, live Romans who actually lived in the neighborhood. The next morning, the buffet breakfast was really good. My son was thrilled. At the first hotel, the buffet breakfast had not been included and, I had felt, not worth the splurge. We had eaten a perfectly nice breakfast in a cafe nearby, but it had been a big disappointment for him. The Duke Hotel does seem to be very child friendly. I think they must get quite a lot of families staying there. The suggestions for children's activities in their brochure were interesting -- a trip to the children's museum, bicycle riding in the Villa Borghese Gardens. The sort of activities I might recommend to a Roman family visiting Manhattan. My son definitely wants to stay there again next summer, but for longer. My husband would prefer to be nearer to the historic center where he can walk around. He had preferred the first hotel. I think that we might have to split it up again just to keep everybody happy.

It was fitted with shutters, as well as curtains, and we were able to open the window for some fresh air. Sky TV was free, which was a bonus for my husband. The buffet breakfast was more than adequate to set us up for a day's sightseeing, with eggs, bacon, sausage, toast on request, cereal, fruit (fresh and preserved), yoghurt, and fresh juices, plus the full array of Italian pastries, croissants and salamis and cheese. Staff are very attentive. The bathroom was spotless, also with an opening window. The shuttle runs every 45 minutes or so down Via Ludovisi, and it's an easy walk down to Piazza Barbarini & the Metro. I imagine in Summer it would be very popular, and as it only holds 7 seats, bookings are essential. There is also the 52 bus which runs from behind Via Del Corso, & drops you at the top of Via Archimede. It's pretty crowded at the beginning but empties out towards the top. We took a taxi from the hotel to a restaurant on Viccolo Della Vacarella, in the Centro Storico & it was about \u20ac11, and a little less to come back again, as we picked a cab up at the rank just round the corner. Both drivers appeared to be surprised to get a tip. Staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. They were very happy to book tours, taxis and whatever we wanted, and the restaurant tip we were given was also excellent. There is a small supermercato just up the hill a bit from the hotel to stock up on drinks & nibbles. Make sure you have some change, they get a bit niggly about changing \u20ac20 notes at the end of the day. Minuses: The hotel is not on a metro line, but instead you can change at Flaminio, then pick up the Roma-Viterbo Line & get off at Euclide, which is just at the botton of the hill the hotel is on. It's pretty easy & it's only one stop & it's also covered by your metro ticket. Despite the free map given out by the hotel saying they sold Metro tickets, they didn't have any & we had to wander down the hill to negotiate with the grumpy woman in the Tabacchi who didn't speak any English & had only the 75 minute tickets - good thing my Italiano was up to it, but be warned, she's not exactly charming. The room was overheated, but we were able to reduce the temperature by leaving the window open. One of our fellow guests came down & was a bit upset that he couldn't control the temperature himself, but the receptionist was very amenable about turning it down. The cost of items in the mini-bar is outrageous. See note about about the Supermercato up the hill. At the end of a long day, the walk back up to the hotel from Euclide is a bit of a drag, but there's no reason you couldn't get a bus, or a cab from town. Overall: I would be very happy to stay there again, but next time I'd go for a bigger room.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cgreat people make for a great stay\u201d", "Author": "richlor", "ReviewID": "UR14256330", "Content": "We stayed at The Duke Hotel in Rome for 4 nights and had a great experience primarily because of the staff.

The accommodations were perfect and they even changed our first room (as it didnt have the balcony we had asked for) without question. The breakfast was stellar, including fresh fruit and a wide variety of fresh pastries and hot and cold dishes. The Duke is a bit off the beaten path, but there is a shuttle which was always on time and which made it easier for us to get around the city and then return to this quiet enclave. We were in Rome but apart from the noise and craziness of the city. Yes, it takes a bit more planning, but it was well worth. We stayed in five hotels while in Italy and this ranked at the top.

Not only was the service outstanding, but the rooms were large, by European standards, light and spacious and had absolutely everything one might need to make a vacation stay welcoming and comfortable. I booked through Expedia and did it months in advance. Being that it was my first trip to Rome (a vacation with a friend), I had little idea of what to expect. The Duke is NOT in the center of all of the hubub and noise which is one of the reasons I chose this hotel. As a result of location, it takes an extra ten minutes to get there, but is well worth it! From Termini, simply take a train to Flaminio, walk up and out of the station and turn right to go into the station for a local train to Piazza Euclide. It's one stop. Upon exiting the station at Piazza Euclide, turn left, pass the lovely restaurant on the left and turn left on via Archimede. Walk up the hill about half a mile and The Duke is on the left. We arrived mid-morning after nearly twelve hours of travel, schlepping our bags on the commuter rail into Boston, connecting to the airport via subway, then on to Philadelphia where we connected with an international flight direct to Rome. Upon arrival, we got a train from the airport to Termini, then took the Metro to Flaminio and then got a local train to Euclide and walked up the hill to The Duke. Although the room was not quite ready, the receptionist greeted us as though she expected our arrival, took us to a beautiful lounge and made sure we were comfortably seated while they finished making the room ready. It was well worth the wait! We had two lovely large windows looking out over terraces of other residences in one of the loveliest Rome neighborhoods. As well, the room had beautiful hardwood floors, windows that opened easily, a huge marble bathroom and a beautiful and large walk-ini closet. The beds were sheeted in white linen. There was a smalll, but very adequate television with multiple channels (for those interested in spending their time watching T.V. when there are so many more interesting things to do!), lovely bedside tables, a built in desk, an in-room safe, ample wooden hangers, chairs and terry robe with slippers for each occupant. It was immaculate, with every detail tended to. Soaps, lotions, tissues and towels were freshened and plentiful daily. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful with a wide variety of fresh fruit, baked goods, cereals, yoghurts, and eggs, cheeses and meat. Each morning we were treated to a pitcher of hot milk and two pitchers of fabulous coffee. By the second day, the wait staff knew who we were and what we preferred and were so attentive and kind. Tables are decked out with linen tablecloths and napkins and the buffet is picture perfect. Staff are attentive but don't hover. The meal was a welcome repast at that early hour and served to take us through much of the day as we walked miles and miles to see as much as we could in this remarkable and beautiful city. The staff were exceptional, from those who served at reception to concierge, to driving staff, to wait staff. All were very kind, most accommodating, highly professional and spoke excellent English. They helped with train schedules for the return trip to the airport, tour reservations for the Villa Borghese, the Ciao Roma bus tour (well worth taking if you have not been to Rome previously) and making change for us when we needed their assistance. Although we were very independent and used the train frequently, the van service to the Spanish Steps was great and we did use that a couple of times. You do need to reserve space, but we had no problems there and often were the only people riding (of course, it was February and not high season). There is a business center with a hotel desktop and printer. It was nice to have access to that in order to check plane reservations, print boarding passes and look up occasional tidbits. The connection was a bit slow, but adequate for our needs. All in all, I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Rome and looking for a place with class and service far above the norm. If I return, I will certainly stay there again as it was a real treat to return there at the end of each busy day, tired but satisfied, to relax and unwind in such comfort.

We had a meal at the restaurant which was reasonably priced and really enjoyable. The breakfasts were also great and had lots for vegetarians like myself. In terms of the room, this has everything that you need, and for us also had the benefit of a quiet location (which after you visit Rome City Centre, you will appreciate!) We also had a balcony which was lovely. In terms of things for improvement, there is one suggestion we would make. The hotel is situated around 15/20 minutes drive away from town and the frequency and availability of the courtesy shuttle bus at busy times (ie morning and late afternoon) should really be improved. It only has 7 seats and this will clearly not be enough for the Hotel at busy periods. However, we travelled back and forth into town many times and only had to get a taxi on one occasion, so if you booked ahead, you would probably be ok. Also, a tip if you go to stay there - they should make sure that you know a lot of the TV channels which are in Italian can be changed to English very simply using the remote control - took us a while to figure that out, and before that all we had was news.

The advantage of the distance to the city centre is the pristine clean air, absence of traffic noise and the sounds of many songbirds in the morning. (We kept our windows open .) I will list both what we enjoyed and also what the downsides were . The breakfasts were delightful with lots of hot dishes, many pastries , juices etc. It was a bargain to have this with the price of the room. The public sitting area was palatial and I read the paper there each morning after breakfast. On two occasions we made it back for afternoon tea and had it there as well. The beds were much harder than the ones you might be used to in America but I slept very soundly each night after a full day of sightseeing. I was Very diappointed to find on arrival that we were given a king sized bed even though we had been promised twin beds by email. It was do-able but really ! Their explanation was that a king was composed of two doubles sharing a common headboards. The linen sheets were lovely to sleep in but the room was very hot and temperature was very difficult to regulate from both the roon and the desk computer. We kept the windows open and this worked out for us. The plug in the bathtub did not work ( maintenance came to try) and so after the first night we had showers only. We would have like the occasional bath but we could live with it. The shuttle bus was brilliant and we used it to go to the closest metro or taxi stand each day. The staff are a delightful team of young people who do their very best to please , The management has chosen very well. If you go during the busy season I understand that there may be a lineup for the shuttle so walk downhill to the nearest taxi stand and take it from there. We called a taxi Twice to the hotel and it did not cost us any more to have it done this way. They come in a matter of minutes. In conclusion aside from the small items I mentioned the stay was a comfortable and enjoyable one. (If you are staying in Rome for a long time consider a train trip to Florence for the day.

That wasn't the main problem, although be prepared to wait as much as 30 minutes for a taxi and then pay a higher rate due to the \"called\" taxi. The best thing I can say about the hotel is the breakfast. For US travellers who are not fond of European breakfast, this one is very good. I paid for two superior rooms for 4 nights each. I would hate to see what a standard room is like. You are not allowed to control the room temperature. I think the floor would have been softer and I would put money on the fact that the sheets were originally table clothes in the dining room. Even at $ 300 per night, don't expect even one free bottle of water. When you check out - you will be charged 5 euros for a 1/2 litre of water. There were no English channels on the TV and when I checked out, the manager told me they had Sky TV. I explained that no one told us nor showed us the system. He then told me it was my fault because I did not find the channels. Overall, you will be much better off finding a different hotel when in Roma!", "Date": "October 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastico!\u201d", "Author": "dicanio10", "ReviewID": "UR5713740", "Content": "I was lucky enough to win a 3 night stay at the Duke which my wife and I have just returned from and it had to be one of the best hotel stays ever and I stay in 4 and 5 star hotels all over Europe on business. Let's get the downside out of the way. It is situated in an upmarket residential area and as such there are no restaurants, bars or metro anywhere nearby, especially in August when a lot of places will close for holidays. I went out exploring one night and found a couple of eateries near Euclide railway station that were open but they didn't look anything special. Looking at a map, it would appear close to Villa Borghese but that was a good 15 minute walk to the entrance and the park is huge! On the upside, the Duke run a complimentary shuttle bus (pre-booking is essential) that will take you to via Ludovisi which is just around the corner from the Spanish Steps or a 5 minute walk to via Veneto for restaurants. The staff at the Duke were second to none, they made us feel extremely welcome and were very friendly. The Polo Lounge was a welcoming retreat after a long day seeing the sights and although the drinks were on the expensive side (well, you have to pay for quality), we enjoyed winding down there every night. The room was a superior double which had a huge bed, large, well-equipped bathroom and flat screen TV with a number of English speaking channels and British Sky Sports which was an unusual thing for European hotels in my experience. Breakfast was included and was the standard European fare of scrambled or hard boiled eggs, bacon, fruits, cereals, pastries and juice and was most enjoyable. We pushed the boat out and had dinner there on the first night (we didn't have anywhere else to go!) and it was good without going over the top and fancy. With a bottle of wine it came to around EUR85 which was a bit over our budget but we thought 'what the heck' for a one-off special occasion. What really swung it for us though was the fantastic staff there who went out of their way to make sure you had an enjoyable stay. There were many Americans staying there as part of their European Tour along with some Brits who had finished a 7 day Mediterranean cruise and wanted a few days in Rome. Overall, a fantastic hotel and one which we hope to stay at again one day", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basingstoke, England", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay at the Duke Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5439117", "Content": "Decided to go to Rome for our 10th wedding anniversary and booked 3 nights at the Duke on the assumption that we would be able to get taxis to and from the city centre.

Yes this hotel is 30 - 40 minutes stoll from the Spanish Steps but I cannot recommend it highly enough. The staff were friendly, professional and exceedingly helpful. At our request they organised tickets for the Papal Audience, which is an experience my wife and I will never forget, as well as restaurants etc. The room, whilst not enormous, was perfect for our requirements (if you go to Rome and want to stay in your room, there's something wrong with you!!!!).

Be aware however that if you want to be in the centre of Rome then you should look for another hotel. The hotel had a courtesy car that took 6/7 people. A taxi was about 10 Euros. If you walked through the Villa Borghese to the Spanish Steps it would take at least 20 minutes. Of course it will take longer if you stop at the restaurant Orologia? I think that's the name and have to say that we generally stopped there for a small refreshment. The hotel itself was very good. We found the staff to be very helpful. They spoke good English. The bedroom was well sized for Rome and was kept clean. It was also quiet. The public areas were pleasant and it was good to sit in the peace and calm of the lounge after a frantic day in Rome.

Most rooms have a balcony overlooking the small neighborhood. Though the location isn't close to everything, it's not as bad as you may think, as long as you are young. I fully enjoyed the various paths to through the Villa Borghese from the hotel. It is a 30 minute brisk walk to the Spanish Steps. If you are not a fan of a good walk, sign up for the shuttle to the Spanish Steps and you'll be in the middle of Rome in no time. We caught the shuttle one day without even signing up (not guaranteed to always be the case). This is a luxuriuous hotel in my book. The dining room/lounge is magnificent. The style is wicked cool with huge leaf cutouts (10') in the ceiling, and a dome in the ceiling. The bartender was super nice. He gave us these bon-bon like treats called moi-moi (if I remember correctly) - they were made locally by hand and were great. They were topped by these magnificent chocolate truffles, probably the best I ever had, and I'm a truffle fan. Puts Godiva and others to shame. Again a local product. The concierge was super-super helpful. One of our party had to spend time in an Italian hospital and the concierge helped us tremendously with all the logistics we had to navigate in a land with a foreign (to us) tongue. On a side note - the Italians are unbelievably nice. The other hospital patients looked after my mother to make sure her needs were being met. They translated or got translators, and gave us all kinds of advice and recommendations. Just beautiful people. The Duke is nearly perfect in my book.

The draw back is indeed it's situation which is excentered but the plus is that it is much more quiet at night! And Italy can be noisy! The shuttle bus was great, but you have to book if going in high season - it only takes 7 persons. It is true that we were out all day visiting so did not need to go back during the day and most evenings we stayed in the centre for diner. The taxi costs anything between 6 euros to 10 euros from the centre of Rome.

We use the trip advisor reviews a lot, so thought I should add mine for the Duke. Room: Very big for Rome, huge double bed, big bathroom with bath robes, very good shower. Private balcony. Four stars. Location: this is probably what lets the Duke down. It is out of the centre and the hotel bus into the centre isn't very frequent and only takes seven so pre-booking is essential. We aren't that organised on holiday so didn't know when we would want to leave and return to the hotel. We walked through Borghese to Piazzo Popolo a few times - about 30 mins pleasant walk. We also got the bus (number 52) to and from the hotel which took 15 mins from Piazza Barberini. We were there for a week so the distance didn't matter to much as we weren't trying to cram a lot into our days. What we found annoying was that it was ifficult to nip back to the hotel to drop things off or freshen up - we tended to stay out into the evening rather than go back. We found a nice restaurant about 5 minutes walk from the hotel (SciSci). But there is not much else in the area in the way of restaurants/bars. Location - two stars. Amenities: the lounge was lovely - big sofas and english reading material. We usually had it to ourselves so don't expect a busy bar. We didn't eat in the restaurant as we stayed in town most evenings (see above). We did have room service on the first evening which wasn't great - 12 euro for a mediocre sandwich. Amenities - three stars. Staff - a lot of people mentioned that the staff were really friendly. In general we didn't find them to be any more friendly or helpful than other hotels we stay in - that's not to say they were unhelpful just normal. The waiter in the lounge however was very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. Staff 3/4 stars. We booked the Duke last minute and got a good deal (110 Euro instead of the standard 300+ euro rate.
