The room is decorated in a modern way. Furniture looks nice. We had a spacious room with big bathroom. The staff was not very friendly but helpful. None of receptionists could help us to find places or destinations we needed. The room was clean every day and the towels changed. We liked the breakfast - you can eat and drink as much as you can so it helps to stay full most part of the day. It was quiet, we didn't hear guests next door. The location is safe despite turkish area around. Underground and bus stations are few minutes away from the hotel.

If you walk north about ten minutes there is the Potsdamer Platz bahnhof, or you can walk south less than five minutes and reach the Kurf\u00fcrstenstra\u00dfe U-bahn stop. I felt very safe in the neighborhood the hotel was in. Rooms were small but clean (pillows were only thing that I didn't like, too small), free wifi was a plus but you need SMS txt messaging to get the code\u200e for it. You can conveniently self check-in at a kiosk in the hotel and checkout is not necessary as you are given a room code and not a card key. I highly recommend the small Joseph-Roth-Diele restaurant right across from the hotel for a lovely setting and excellent meal.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon", "Title": "\u201cVery modern Hotel.

I described hotel as an upmarket Mister Bed, if you are familiar with that chain. Our room was on mainroad side but the double glazing kept noise out. The photos shown above do reflect the hotel accurately. One problem was that room was very hot and A/c did not seem to make any difference. Reported it to staff who said they would check it. Reasonable cold buffet breakfast (6Euro). Also a good cafe right across the road for a meal. About 15 mins walk from Potsdamer Platz U-bahn. Kurfurstenstrasse U-bahn much nearer but it was closed (would have been useful if B&B website has warned us of that before we arrived there!).

The Berlin B&B is walking distance from galleries and museums, Brandenburg Tor, Haulocost Museum, the Sony Center, Tiergarten, great restaurants, and many shops. Breakfast is not included in the price, but we highly recommend it for the 6 something Euros it costs. The food selection is incredible and fresh, and you won't need lunch!

Although our room wasn't cleaned when we arrived, it was cleaned very fast after the notice to the staff. Personnel was very friendly and helpful, unlike someone commented before... I noticed something strange about WiFi though (ipod touch) - First two nights my WiFi wasn't working correctly. I had to reconnect all the time, but at a return trip, the WiFi was working perfectly. Room was very nice with ampelmanns on the wall and conditioner, although TV was too small for me ( ~19-20 inches). Double -room had two beds that can be connected to one big bed. Toilet was quite nice, but the soap was only in the shower, so i had to take it from there - something what to change ;) Hotel is located about 10 -minute walk from a Potsdamer-Platz in a something that i would describe as a Turkish area - nothing bad about it though... Breakfast was a typical one - nothing exciting.
