My flight was delayed and got there a day late, they still had my reservation and warmly welcomed me. Breakfast buffet was a variety of amazing foods I never got to eat any dinner from the hotel though i suppose it was also amazing They have bars inside the hotel which makes it a good start if you are a party animal, i never heard any of the noices i saw other reviewers complaining about. Its also located around 10 mins from terminal two and 15 from terminal one making it very convinient. its also very easy to hail a taxi right outside the hotel. The rooms were always spotless clean, They also have swimming pool a bit small but ok, a well furnished gym facility and a sauna where i spend most of my evenings. I would reccomend the hotel to anyone going to Dubai and I will definatly be staying there again. Oh and the metro is right outside the hotel if you want to take a ride in one.................", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cnarrow spaced resturant\u201d", "Author": "saeid z", "ReviewID": "UR124063454", "Content": "It is a 3 stars hotel ,located on near by metro station and main street. it is totally indian ,spacious room but the resturant is no space to seat with angry staffs. bell boys are kind and friendly", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cGreat budget hotel with nearby facilities\u201d", "Author": "Thai4Ever", "ReviewID": "UR123606824", "Content": "This hotel is located at the back of Al Rigga street which is a main road with lots of restaurants opened till late at night.

This basis there was slot of debris all over the lobby and bar area upstairs. Whilst the construction seemed to go on through the day and night, there was no noise at all when in the room. The food was not good at all, but maybe because we went during the Ramadhan period so leftovers served during the day. The hotel location is located near the airport which is good for late night arrivals or early morning departures. For shopping, the hotel is too far away from the main shopping malls like Dubai festival city or dubai mall. That said, the taxi system works quite efficiently and the hotel can organize one even short notice. The hotel has free wifi which you have to request for from the reception. The hotel service is of acceptable levels for a 3 star hotel. I would recommend this hotel for anyone on a shoestring or on a short shopping trip where all one needs is a place to sleep. I forgot to add the hotel rooms are quite spacious and there is tv with a number of good channels.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": ", United KingdomBournemouth", "Title": "\u201cVery basic and bad service\u201d", "Author": "Tojamul", "ReviewID": "UR90140074", "Content": "Do not be decieved by the pictures, having stayed for 7 nights the cleanliness, food, service, and even the size of the Hotel is not upto he standard of a 3 star hotel (purely my opinion). Fitness centre was very very basic with very few facilities (2 pre-dated jogging machines, some dumbells, and bench press). The only positive was the location is good, everything was a quick taxi ride away. Also they have their own activity/entertainment agents who proved useful.. we went on the desert safari, Dhowl boat ride and the Burj tour guide all which are recommended (but is quite pricey!).", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran", "Title": "\u201cRude staff, bad service.

The staff simply ignore your requests for anything(even a wake up call is considered as extra service). In my first travel(october 2008), I arrived at night and the transportation to hotel arrived late at the airport. Then they gave me a room in the 2nd floor. I did not know that there are two discos in the first floor and I could not sleep until 4 AM because of the disco's sound. The next time(aug 2009) I asked for a room in upper floors and they gave me one in 5th floor. I was naked in my room shaving when some guy entered my room with one of the hotel stuff. I was really shocked. The reception had given him the same room as mine. I do not know how it can happen!!!! They did not come for transportation and I took a taxi. The food was good in my first trip but in the second, it was spicy. Furthermore the restaurant was full if you were a little late and you should stay in the lobby while others are eating (there is not enough couches in the lobby). Fish and chips was only chips and nobody cared to fill the fish dish again. Very bad service when they are a little busy. Their English is terrible and you can hardly understand what they say. I do not recommend it to anybody. Go to another 3 star hotel. This time I am going to Ibis (2 stars) but I won't go to Fortune again.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangalore", "Title": "\u201cValue for Money\u201d", "Author": "RohitMBangalore", "ReviewID": "UR49032941", "Content": "This is at a very convinient location at Diera area.

I stayed at this hotel during the Arabian Travel Mart. It is a time when hotels can be difficult to find and have rediculously high rates. By the way, Dubai hotels are these days rediculously expensive anyways. I got a single room for 125 usd. The hotel apartment was recent renamed to fortune hotel apartment and is just behind the office tower of ABN AMRO located on the main bank street in Bur Dubai. This hotel is around 5 minutes walk from Bur Juman which is about a 3 block walk. There is a good mosque across the bank street road. There is also a good supermarket nearby and decent places to eat as its a office district. The rooms were clean, breakfast was sufficient and staff was friendly.
