We stayed in the Musee D'Orsay room which was comfortable and included everything you might need. I was a little scared about the area due to reviews I had read but the main street of Place de Clichy was fine and had large rstaurants and also more intimate settings. We particularly like the set menu from Bistro Melrose which is on the main stretch on the right hand side as you come out of the Metro station. Most of the main attractions of Paris ie touristy things take about 20 mins on the Metro to get to but very easy and cheap.

The reviews I had read were slightly mixed so we were visiting wiyh a completely open mind. On arrival we were given a tour of the hotel while our cases were taken to our room following which we were made coffee and asked whether we needed anything to eat as we must have been travelling for a long time. The room we were given was one of the Eiffel tower rooms which was small (as you would expect in a city) but beautiful in every way. The bathroom had a whirlpool bath which was very nice to use after hours of walking around the city and the bed was very comfortable. The maid service was also of the highest possible standard, every day the room was made to feel as though you were just checking in. If before choosing a hotel you are considering staying here then you will not be let down at all if you receive the same service which we did. Do not be put off by its location you are a five minute walk from \"Place De Clichy\" metro which gives good access to most stations in the city and is also on the same line as Garde Nord if you are travelling from Charles de Gaulle airport. There are plenty of wonderful places to eat within a short walk and the area feels very safe even late at night. We have travelled thoughout many cities in Europe and the United States and this hotel is the friendliest we have ever experienced. I hope the owners of this establishment read the reviews on Trip advisor as the staff here deserve some recognition for the amazing customer service they give to their customers. It is also worth mentioning that as the rooms in this hotel are themed the hotel offers for you to change rooms during your stay at no extra charge your breakfast can also be served in bed for no additional charge. The breakfast is of the highest standard and again the employees here excel with their attentive service. BRILLIANT HOTEL WE WOULD NOT LOOK TO RETURN ANYWHERE ELSE IN PARIS. If you are looking to eat out in the evening we found two restaurants which were particularly good so you might like to check them out (Bistro Lorette) and (Chez Gabrielle).", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camberley, Surrey", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay\u201d", "Author": "DawnB1", "ReviewID": "UR125694316", "Content": "We loved this hotel.

The hotel itself is in a period building and yet is extremely modern, chic and clean, so combines character with contemporary standards. The rooms are not big -- but then I imagine this is true for all hotels at this level in Paris, and it was perfectly big enough for a long weekend. The ensuite was very good, with a lovely whirlpool bath and great shower. State of the art lighting and flat screen TV were also highlights of the room. The breakfast is excellent (if pricey), with gorgeous cheeses, fruit, bread and croissants as well as cooked options; again, nothing is too much trouble. I have not given the hotel 5 stars for one reason, and that's location. It's just not quite anywhere you want to be. The nearest Metro is Place de Clichy which is a little seedy, though there are a couple of nice restaurants there (one of which the Hotel kindly booked for us for our first night). To get to anywhere interesting, you either have a lengthy and/or complicated journey on the Metro (eg. to Chatelet Les Halles for the Pompidou) or a fairly long walk (eg. Montmartre).

Probably this district is considered to be in the center part of the city, however, it is far from being a tourist one. There is only one attraction in walking distance, that is the Mouline Rouge.

The modern/slightly funky decor creates a cosy intimate environment. It is not cheap, but I have paid the same or more at other places and this clearly represents the best value.

I liked the room design alot and the themed rooms give it character but it is still very modern. Bathroom was nice and clean. The shower head looks better than it is but is still good. Breakfast is a buffet of cold cuts and breads than you chose how you would like your eggs and they cook them to order. The eggs are abit overcooked and the bread is stale. If you go down place de clichy there is some great cafes. The location is ok, not fantastic. Its right near the moulin rouge and pigalle rd which is know for its red light district and is not safe at night. It is about a 20min walk to the champes elysees, which is the main road. Staff were helpful at times with making bookings and always being polite. We did have a issue with our laundry though, on the price list they do not mention it is a pressing service not a cleaning service. The 1st night we got there we needed our washing done so we took it downstairs expecting it to be back by the next afternoon. It was not there until 10am the morning we were checking out when we wanted to be gone by 8am. We finally got our washing and the bill was for 180 euros!!! We estimated it would cost around 50euros! There was nothing we could do about it but pay it. I would suggest to walk down the road for 1 min and go to the laundry mat yourself. We wish we saw it before we dropped our washing off and went there. We also had a issue with parking. The carpark is about 6 blocks away so best to drop your bags off than go park. It is also a very complex carpark to get in and out of. The desk where you are ment to pay is on level 3 hidden.

Everything that every review says (the numerous positive ones) is/are true. The service is fantastic, the rooms are adorable and clean, the staff is wonderful, and the location is great. Each room is designed very well, from the lighting fixtures to the decor. I also loved loved LOVED the two (yes, two!) french-door windows. We opened them every night and listened to the sounds of Paris as we fell asleep. Instead of repeating more of the same praises found in other reviews, I would like to address some of the negatives that people discussed: Location being \"far away\" from everything: Yes, you're in a more residential area of Paris. EMBRACE THAT. There are fewer tourists, McDonald's, Starbucks, etc. You're not fighting with crowds every day, and you can actually experience Paris the way you should. Stop in a neighborhood cafe, practice your French at the bakery, see a movie! These are all things that can significantly add to a vacation! You are within four short blocks in either direction from a Metro. My husband and I took the Metro everywhere we went and no \"tourist\" destination took us over twenty minutes of travel time. We also saved a lot of money by eating breakfast and lunch at neighborhood locations. Something worth noting is that since you're in a more residential area, late July/early August will have many closed shops for vacation. The streets are a little dark at night because of these closures, but I don't expect this to be a problem other than the July 20 - August 20 time frame. The rooms are small: Umm, it's a Paris boutique hotel. This is not the United States where everything is huge. Stop expecting the Hilton with full-sized closets and dressers. The rooms are small, but ridiculously well designed and charming. There is plenty of storage space. These rooms are no different than you would see in New York City or Chicago. Space is expensive in large cities - embrace the fact that they've done such a good job with the space they provide! The bathrooms: Ok, the bathrooms are a little interesting. The shower and sink area are really cute, but the toilet is not blocked off in any way, and half of the door is clear glass. That being said, you could be doing your business and your travel partner could see everything through the glass door. This is a little awkward, and they should've put a separate door on the toilet area. You very well may be asking your travel partner to leave the room while you handle some things, and this situation is definitely worth noting. As for me, I don't spend my entire vacation in the bathroom and I would choose the other amazing qualities of this hotel over a silly design flaw. We loved loved LOVED this hotel and can't wait to go back and visit again.

I cannot rave enough about the quality of this hotel, from the charming rooms to the wonderful staff. When we checked into the hotel we were shown around the hotel and our room personally by one of their lovely staff. When we got to our room we were also presented with a bottle of Moet and little snacks as a thank you for our \"extended stay\". If this lovely little gesture wasn't enough, when we checked out they also removed one of the breakfasts that we had at the hotel from our bill. We stayed in the Musee d'Orsay themed room, but were also given the option of switching rooms if we liked throughout our stay. We were so comfortable and loved our room so much we ended up staying put. The spa in the room and rain shower are perfect after a full day of sightseeing, and the different lighting concepts were a nice touch. A lot of people complain about the size of the rooms... to this, all i have to say is that you have picked the wrong city. Considering how little time you spend in the room when holidaying in Paris, it is more than ample in size. The beds are comfortable I think this hotel is perfect for couples but probably not as suitable for families.

I had several radio/TV interviews and I could be refreshed thanks to the staff amazing work and the hotel great construction.

The bouquet of flowers, which I ordered via their site, was very well chosen. I was very pleased that we got a complimentary bottle of Champagne accompanied with olives and a fruit basket! There was even a hand written welcome letter! I stayed in hotels where good service is most important, but this kind of service have I never experienced! The room is equiped with a big flat screen TV, multi cd-player, mood adjusting light and a mini bar with 2 bottles of orange juice and water (included).

My wife booked us here because she thought it looked \"interesting\". This is an understatement. Don't let the google street view put you off - they haven't been back around the street since the hotel opened, and as a result they display what looks like a building site shell! The actual building is rather excellently appointed in a modern style, with lots of funky graphics and a great feel. Highlights include the blue and purple uplighting on the upper floors which mean you can tell you're heading back to the hotel at night - it's instantly recognisable for a good distance down the hill of the rue de clichy - and the lift, which is mirrored on all 6 sides and makes for a matrix-esque moment. We stayed in a moulin rouge themed room, which had a HUGE bed, a very funky wet room bathroom with an enormous ceiling mounted shower, and a huge Samsung LED tv with a DVD player attached which could itself hook up to just about anything, there's a USB port on there which looks like it'll pull MP3s off, and I noticed the speakers either side of the bed in the Dolby 2+1 surround the player supported. I've seen some pictures of the other rooms and they look equally quirky and well kitted out. The advertised free wifi works rather well - it's fast and they've taken the time to put two access points in (from our room on the first floor), so coverage shouldn't be a problem. Location is good - Montmartre's delicious gaudiness is a few minutes' walk, as is the shopping heart of Paris. Get a metro pass though, and you'll be getting around some serious sights in no time - this is in my opinion vital for any short stay in Paris, no matter where you are, so you can really see the sights. If you want to get the Arc de Triomphe and Quasimodo's hang-out done in a day you've got to go metro! All the usual amenities are there, good hairdryer, fridge, aircon. The decor is great fun, and the tech extends to the lighting, which actually has it's own instructions in the room in the hotel information pack. White, red, dimmed... You can definitely crank up the romance in this pad. The hotel has sauna and gym facilities which we were invited to use as we wished - in fact, the concierge said we should ring down 15 mins or so beforehand so they could ensure things were up to temperature. This could come in handy if you've been using the velib public rental bikes: if you want to get around town quickly without braving the metro (which, by the way, is excellent and no more confusing that london's tube network) then there is a bike station with pay point right outside the hotel. This is a good point to mention the helpful nature of the staff here. Whether this is a function of the hotel being new or not, I'd encourage anyone who is thinking of staying in Paris, or running a hotel themselves, to visit this place. They literally cannot do enough for you, and their enthusiasm and smiles are utterly infectious. They get their breakfast stuff from Maison Landemaine down the road - this is well worth a visit, they've got some of the best cakes and croissants I think I've ever tasted. Finally, this place is awesomely reasonable compared to a lot of placed I've stayed in. Get in there ASAP if you're staying in Paris anytime soon.

Everything about the room was very romantic and we were thrilled with it. The hotel is gorgeous, but small. The only real problem I had with it was the location, which was primarily a problem when the Metro station down the street closed for service during our stay. I've been to Paris before, but was not familiar enough with the city to get around without relying on public transport -- taxis were difficult to get late at night, which made returning to the hotel difficult. On our final night, the air conditioning, which had been wonderful during our stay, broke down on one of the hottest days of our honeymoon. It was a tough night, but the hotel was so apologetic about it. I am very doubtful this is normal for them. Again, if you want a very unique experience for a good price, then I recommend it, but be advised that you will need to travel a bit to get to various Paris sights.
