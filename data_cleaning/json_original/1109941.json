I had initially chosen this hotel because of the Radisson Brand and the standards that I know from other Radisson Hotels. However I must admit that I was a bit disappointed, as the standards here are much lower than what I have been used to at other radisson, probably because it is a residence? Not sure... The 1bedroom apartment we had was quite spacious, no doubt about that, however there were obvious signs of wear and tear in the room, a testimony that some refurbishing is definitely needed. We were also quite surpised to see that the kitchen was not as well appointed as described on the homepage (e.g. there was no microwave oven and no dishwasher! -- at least in the 1 bedroom apartment as we were told when I mentioned that to the staff). On the positive side, the staff is VERY helpful and the location is excellent, close to the beach and Jumeirah walk and the Dubai Mall where there is a Waitrose supermarket. The hotel is situated on a busy street though which you can hear (but get used to quite fast. Also note that this is due to the fact that the door to the balcony are not soundproofed, meaning that you are more likely to be bother by the noise if you take a sudio rather than a 1 bedroom apartment where the windows in the bedroom are much better isolated). I wouldnt rule out coming back to this hotel, but it will not be my first choice.

Both rooms had an en-suite bathroom and there was a third toilet as well. The bathrooms have nice amenities. The kitchen is fully equipped and has a dishwasher and a washing machine and drier. The room was on the 20th floor, so we had a pretty good view of the sea, as well as of the skyscrapers. No noise, in spite of the proximity of the busy roads. We rented a car and parked just outside the door every day, in the hotel parking. The staff was always extremely friendly and tried their best to help in any situation. The concierge organized a car to pick us up at the airport, booked tours, provided beach bags with towels for the beach, booked tables in restaurants and also offered a complimentary shuttle service to the beach, to Dubai Mall and more. There are many nice restaurants in the area called The Walk, just by the sea, as well as the Marina Mall next door, with an excellent Waitrose supermarket. So overall, very good value for money. It's a pity, though, that the outdoor pool was in the shade quite early in the afternoon. The water is very warm, though. If you don't get there early, the few loungers get taken up quite quickly.

Nonetheless I chose to book online a studio apartment, as the accommodation description and pictures looked very appealing. A last minute change in my commitments forced me to change dates, so I ended up with one bed apartment room for two days and then switched to a studio apartment for the rest of my stay. The minimalist style of the apartments was decisive in my choice. I am all for simple and clean designs! Both apartments were decorated with soft pastel colours and featured a fully equipped kitchenette. The amenities included my requirements: a big work desk, free high-speed internet access, a flat-screen TV and a safe deposit box. The studio apartment was very spacious and well-lighted. It did not face Sheikh Zahed road, so this posed no problem noise-wise. I had read reviews that complained about the noise and therefore asked for a quiet room. The hotel is located in the Dubai Marina area, at a walking distance from the Marina Mall, supermarkets and Jumeirah Beach. The beaches along \u201cthe Walk\u201d are well maintained, clean, tidy and comfortable if they are private. Otherwise they are public and with no comforts, but even though very pleasant. The 1, 7 km waterfront strip can be an agony if you drive to the beach. Most of the time you get stuck in a traffic jam. Fortunately there are many other beach options if you have a car. The Jumeira beach in the Umm Suqeim area is one of them. The metro station just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the hotel is also an alternative option to go to many places avoiding the inconvenience of traffic congestion, which is often the case of the nearby Sheikh Zahed road. Although rated as one of the best restaurants in the Marina area, I wasn\u2019t thrilled with the hotel\u2019s Thai restaurant.

Hotel wanted to charge an extra 720 dhms as 'day rate', which I thought was on the high side, especially since they had a vacant room available, albeit not a non smoker I had requested. On five other occasions Dubai hotels have waived additional charges for an early check-in. I suppose it depends on how hotels wish to engender customer relations with guests on arrival. The room was somewhat disappointing and was one of the least attractive in the hotel. It was on the second level and faced the Sheikh Zayed Road (the main freeway). There was no carpeting on the stone tiled floor, even by the bed. The noise from constant traffic meant that the balcony served no purpose. I couldn't even hear the tv because of the noise level outside and the tv had a very quiet maximum volume level. The positives: after some negotiation, the hotel did agree to reduce the day charge by 50%; the bed and bedlinens were heavenly and the most comfortable I have slept in; There is free wi-fi and the hotel staff were very good in asisting me with an internet connection. The hotel is within easy walking to Dubai Marina Mall and the marina restaurants, both of which offer an excellent selection of eateries. The beach and metro stop are also withing easy distance. I might consider a future stay in Radisson Blu only if the room was on a high floor, quiet and partly carpeted.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europe", "Title": "\u201cDecent friendly priced family hotel\u201d", "Author": "REKV", "ReviewID": "UR97393282", "Content": "This is an excellent hotel when travelling with family. We stayed in a 2 bedroom appartment that provided sufficient space for a family of 3 or 4. Even on the 13nd floor, the noise of trafic at Sheik Zayed road is considerable, so best to aks for a room not facing Zayed road. The beach is only a 10 min walk away, with lots of restaurants around. Breakfast is overpriced (as usually in hotels), better go to the Waitrose supermarket in the Marina mall. Taxi's to the city center and malls are well available and not expensive. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful.

The room is large and very well equipped with kitchen amenities. Some disadvantages: (1) we had a room on the first floor with windows facing Seikh Zayed road so the road noise was a little bit disappointing (but not to much to ask for another room). So it\u2019s recommended to ask for the room as high as possible not facing Seikh Zayed road. (2) the breakfast in the hotel\u2019s Thai restraint is not worth its money - after two mornings we decided to had a breakfasts in restaurants and cafes situated on the Promenade (10 minutes afoot in Dubai Marina Walk) or bought some food in the Waitrose supermarket in Dubai Marina Mall.

There are some design flaws. Firstly the bathroom didn't have enough lighting. The modern sinks are so shallow you get water splashing back on you. One of the bedrooms had a light switch in a very strange place hidden behind a headboard. The washer dryer is strange. Washed my clothes but the drying didn't seem to work. They should have separate washers and dryers. The beds have rather sharp wood frames that can make for painful knocks. So be careful. Location: there is a supermarket in the next service apartment. The setting is not that attractive - its on the main road not the marina itself unlike some other residence hotels. The Thai restaurant is attractive but the food was expensive and wasn't good. I left a souvenir behind in the room when I checked out and called the hotel to check on it 2 days later. They said they would call me at my new hotel to let me know if they found it but they never called back. It wasn't valuable so I let it go but would have appreciated a call back. Bear in mind there is a lot of competition in the area eg Marriott, Dusit etc so shop around.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Radisson Blu Residence, Dubai Marina", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d1109941-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Residence_Dubai_Marina-Dubai.html", "Price": "$152 - $408*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">392-260 Street K</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Dubai Marina</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> (Formerly Radisson SAS)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1109941", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/00/d0/00d0a0c1ae52ef8ee25212b8ac5451601large.jpg"}}
