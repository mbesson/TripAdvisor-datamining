It was very convenient to the bus lines (use the #5 across the street to get to the Termini train station and back). Breakfast was okay -- basically coffee, juice, and eight different kinds of bread. The shower gave new meaning to low-flow (more like a heavy mist). It took awhile to rinse. They still use old-fashioned metal keys, and the only way to lock the door is with a keyed deadbolt. Thus, if you lock the door and take the key with you, anyone left in the room can't get out. We traveled together, so we didn't ask for another key -- I don't know if they have more than one to give. There was a terrific stench in our room (turned out it was a dry floor drain letting sewer gas into the room) and there was a very loud nightclub behind the hotel with drunk people screaming (really screaming!) under our window nonstop from about 2-5 a.m. The window was actually well-built enough to block the noise (mostly), but we had to leave it open to vent the sewer gas. By the third night, we finally figured it out. We poured water down the drain to block the gas and closed the window. Problem solved! Suggestions: If you choose this place, ask for a room facing the street, rather than the courtyard behind, where the nightclub is. Also, if the bathroom stinks to high heaven, use the coffeepot to pour a few pitchers of water down the floor drain to take care of it.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Harper Woods, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cStaff was friendly and room was fine\u201d", "Author": "tlc111", "ReviewID": "UR121986740", "Content": "We just got back from a trip to Rome where we stayed at this hotel.

Due to an incident there, I had to stay here. The room - this was ok. The worst are the bathrooms... Disgusting. I have pictures that I will upload. Our particular shower didnt work properly... The hotel didnt fix it as it was a Saturday night they said. The towels are not normal towels, they are the wafer thin towels... I have never seen these types of towels before... Not even in one star hotels!! The air conditioning on the 5th floor was extremely poor- turned off at midnight which meant it was very very warm at night. Itried leaving the windows open but got Mosquitos in the room that bit me as a result. And worst of all was the service... All the receptionists very unhelpf and rude. They couldnt turn the ac back on and told us 'sorry nothing we can do'... Een after looking at the bites on me. The shower that was broken and was spitting water - they said they can't do anything till Monday ( it was Saturday when I had these issues). The reception seemed to be getting annoyed at why we were complaining... I assure u these were obvious complaints. You expect the shower and AC to work if the hotel advertises it has these facilities. On the second day of our stay, they moved our room. But it was for a measly 6 hours until we checked out so didn't do us much good. Breakfast - poor. Don't know why they bother serving it to be honest. The hotel has a lift which is slow abs you will find yourself waiting forever to get on it. Overall, the staff were very rude, I was supposed to stay in a much nicer hotel but ended up staying in this poor excuse for a two star (it says its a 3 star online). Rome is a lively city but it's this hotel that spoilt it for us.. Almost ruined our holiday. Just avoid this hotel..

However the hotel provided us with a good overall first experience. The majority of the staff are very polite. 2 gentlemen in particular on reception (unfortunately don't know their names) were extremely helpful. We had a slight issue with our flights being cancelled during our stay and the gentleman on reception tried his best to help us all he could. We had to change hotels due to this as they were fully booked, but otherwise we would've stayed on longer. Some staff members didn't seem to like us bothering them but this was only 1 or 2 people. The service overall couldn't really be faulted. The rooms are very clean, but small. However, this wasn't a concern to us as we only really used it to shower and sleep! When in Rome you're barely in the hotel room anyway! Room had a small television with all Italian channels so we didn't really make use of it. There is a mini bar provided, which isnt too pricey and the hotel is against you bringing in outside food and drink (pretty common in most hotels) The hotel is located a little further away but most sights are within walking distance. There are buses and trams that leave literally from right outside the hotel but we decided to walk everywhere. The colosseum was around 10 mins walk and really easy to find. The only downside to the area of the hotel is the busy intersection of road it is located. At night it was pretty noisy and traffic goes on all through the night/early morning. It didn't make it too difficult to sleep since we were always exhausted from walking around all day anyway! The beds werent too bad. We had a twin room and found them quite small and not the most comfortable. The area might seem a little off-putting to some, but it is a safe place. As 2 young girls we walked around at night looking for local restaurants etc with no bother from any one. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant except for breakfast one morning. In all honesty it wasn't worth going to. Very limited and whats there really isn't the best. We only went once and avoided it the 2nd morning. There is a nice little Italian restaurant built into the front of the hotel too. We ate here the first night. It's decent food, friendly service and relatively cheap for Rome (which we learned after finding other more pricey places!) There is also a small shop outside to buy drinks etc. Wi-fi is available at the hotel, unlimited use for 6 euros. The only downside is you have to be in the wi-fi room and cannot use it in your bedroom. However, this was still not bad considering the 2nd hotel we went to wanted 5 euros just for 1 hour. Overall this was a very nice hotel. Did not have any complaints at all but I would not return unless I couldn't find somewhere else. It's clean and has friendly helpful staff. Only downside is it is a little further out, which is not a problem if you take advantage of the public transport in the area, but since we walked everywhere we preferred a hotel closer into the city.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murrells Inlet, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cOK Hotel, not great.\u201d", "Author": "Scooter_014", "ReviewID": "UR117431516", "Content": "I visited Rome in August 2011, and stayed 2 night at this Hotel. It is listed as a three star hotel, but I saw it as a two-star with possibilities of a three-star. The location is safe, and directly next to bus/tram stops which will take you to most places in Rome. It is also across from the Porta Maggiore, an old Roman structure directly across from the hotel. While the location is not bad, a location more centralized would avoid a 15-20 minute ride on public trans each time you want to explore the city. The limited subway line does not stop near the hotel, so a transfer to a bus or tram at the main train station is necessary. The helpful staff at the front desk can direct you to which bus routes to take. Keep in mind that the some bus routes run limited hours, so be sure to ask how to get back if you have a late night. The room I stayed in was reminiscent of a college dorm. The TV was small, and the furniture was very bland, but useable. The bedding was adequate. While my room overlooked the street, the window was able to quieten the street noise. The room was also air-conditioned, which worked beautifully. Please note that the towels and washcloths are not the terry material, but a made of a thin material similar to a bedsheet or placemat. They work, but are different. The room I stayed in, however, was marred by an ant infestation on the second night. The floors are tile, so after returning, I saw a large number of ants on the floor. I suppose the guests before me had spilled something under the bed, which was not mopped up. As I was there for only two nights, I did not request to change rooms. The breakfast is poor at best. There were limited selections of cookies and cereal. I would suggest skipping the breakfast and going out for a much better meal. In addition to the poor selection, the staff was slow to clean tables and refresh the items, so the place was also messy. If you go when they open, you might have better luck. Or just go out for breakfast. Upon checkout, my room was charged for a meal (which I didn't purchase). I denied the charge, and the fee was waived with no questions. If you are not spending much time in the hotel, and do not mind a bit of a commute on bus/trams to get to the city, the Hotel Portamaggiore might work for you.

Right by the hotel literally 5 minutes walk away is the student area where theres a uni. This is the only place in Rome we found,with what you would actually call pubs/bars. The rest are cafes selling pizza and beer. No good for getting hammered in! The whole of Rome is a complete rip off though.

No wardrobe space for a room with 3 people in it and only 5 hangers to hang our clothes. The hair dryer did not work and the shower is only a hand held one. No Tea /Coffee making facilities in the rooms. Our room was at the end of a long corridor and overlooked the roof terrace shown on web site photo. However, when you looked down out of the window the view was of a dirty scruffy yard and the noise from either staff or local people throughout the night was dreadful. We had to shut the windows to allow us to get any sleep and the room was very hot and stuffy as a result. The hotel was on a very busy street and traffic is constant. The trams stop opposite the hotel and this is the best way of getting around as it certainly was not in a great position and there was nothing immediately around the hotel. Tram number 5 or 14 takes you to the Termini, where you can get transport to where ever you need to go, all transport is very frequent and we never waited too long to get anywhere. We arrived early on the first day due to flight times and couldn't even get a coffee. The hotel bar does not open in the summer (only throughout the winter months) and the Roof terrace does not open its bar until 4pm. There was no food available at this bar. The snack/drink vending machines in the hotel were very expensive. Breakfast was nothing special...... pastries, processed ham & cheese, rolls (sometimes stale) and machines for coffee, hot water or juices. Some of the staff was more approachable than others and we were left feeling a bit of an inconvenience to them at times if we had a question or query. There was one incident where a group of school students, staying at the hotel were being noisy, banging around and moving furniture, yelling out of the windows late at night and the member of staff at the reception desk did sort it our when we complained.

My wife likes sleeping with the TV on anyway, so we kept the TV on at night and that helped drowned out the noises that could possibly keep us up in the halls at night and in the mornings. The breakfast seemed pretty typical to what I had experienced in my previous hotels in Italy, nothing grand but it does the job. Again with the college kids staying at the hotel it seemed like most of the time when we went to and from our room, there was a big group of them hanging out right in the lobby. It almost seemed like 85% of the people staying in the hotel while I was there was with a college group. The front desk was helpfull with my questions, but a few of them didn't seem very excited to help, kinda like it was a chore. The 571 Bus stop is right in front of the hotel and takes you around to some of the touristy places, but don't try and take it on sunday or you will stand out there for 45 minutes like we did, and find that it doesn't run on sundays. The underground metro is a few blocks around the corner and goes to most touristy places or is within a reasonable walk to them. The little pizza shop next to the hotel right after the internet cafe, has very reasonable prices and has good pizza for something quick and good. So all and all, check to see if there are cleaner nicer rooms available for the same price when you check in. If you can tolerate it, I would leave the TV on at night to help the hall way noise.

Our bedroom on the third floor had a balcony and overlooked gardens and courtyards at the rear, it was not large but was adequate and clean with comfortable beds and was quiet. There was a safe and more than enough heating capacity for us. The bathroom was fine with a shower but no bath. The shower did tend to leave puddles on the floor but these drained into the drain in the floor with no problems. There was a hairdryer. Breakfast is a bit basic but perfectly adequate and the staff were friendly. I felt that we had excellent value for what we paid for our stay.

This hotel I think is perfect for a short break 3 or 4 nights but not longer. We were in a room at the front of the hotel and for many people, especially if you are a light sleeper the noise from outside could be a problem. I am a very heavy sleeper but even so the traffic noise woke me at about 2am on the Saturday night. I understand the rooms at the back of the hotel are quieter. We were on the third floor and quite a way from the reception area which was not too much of a problem although the lift does seem to be old and possibly on its last legs. The room was very small as was the en-suite shower but for such a short stay I was not too bothered. I have to say when we arrived and let ourselves into the room it was stiflingly hot and very \"smelly\". However, we opened the window and turned off the \"fan\" and within an hour or so it was fine. The room was kept very clean although the bed was two singles pushed together with a double sheet over the top and thus a gap presented itself in the middle. We only stayed here on a bed and breakfast basis and I must say the breakfast was awful. All drinks i.e., coffee, juice, water etc., is from \"serve yourself machines\". The coffee was like mud. The food offered was not much better, cereal in tiny tiny bowls, hard bread, rolls and croissants and some tired looking processed ham and cheese. Needless to say we opted for the small \"very italian\" coffee shop next door where the cappucino was lovely, there was a great selection of mouth watering pastries and sandwiches and when I asked for an orange juice, two fresh oranges were squeezed right in front of me. Coffee, juice and a pastry for 2 came to around 6 euros. The hotel is approximately a 20 minute walk to the colosseum and the same to Termini station. Buses are available although we walked everywhere. Neither of the restaurants in the hotel looked up to much so we opted to find our own restaurants which were brilliant. For a short trip the Open Top \"hop on hop off\" tour buses are great and enable you to see everything and then possibly go back to look in more detail at anything that takes your fancy. The bar area in the hotel is very pleasant and not overly expensive. Most of the staff are extremely pleasant and helpful but there were a couple of exceptions, two particular reception individuals being quite surly and disdainful. We virtually saw everything we wanted to and although I would go back to Rome as I found it absolutely beautiful and beathtaking, this would not be for a few years. I would however consider staying in this hotel again.

This was booked through Gate1 Travel as a Paris, London, Rome vacation on plan C. There were some positives and negatives. The main thing to stress is to remember that you get what you pay for. There is nothing extravagant. The room consist of a bed, desk, phone, refrigerator, safe and T.V. The positives are the cleanliness of the room, the helpful staff that spoke English fluently, a delightful breakfast that consist of glazed croissants, pastries, rolls, cereals, deli meats and cheeses, jams, cappuccinos, espressos, coffee, and juices. To continue the hotel has two lifts (elevators,) bar, restaurant and two lounge areas. The first negative and maybe the main one is taking a shower would flood the bathroom. This was not simple flooding. It was over the shower, all on the floor and coming out the bathroom. The drain in the shower could not handle the water flow and the drain in the bathroom floor could not handle the overflow. The second night to avoid the same occurrence we had to basically take a shower with a small trickle coming from the water spout. The problem was the shower is only able to handle maybe an inch of standing water afterwards it starts pouring over the shower onto the floor. So keeping the shower water down to a trickle was the only resort. Very inconvenient because showers took longer but it worked. The second negative was an un pleasurable odor in the bathroom. I would relate it to maybe a plumbing/sewage odor. The third negative was the rooms are not sound proof or even close to sound proof. The floors are ceramic tile (inside and outside the rooms.) You could hear anyone walking that was wearing hard bottom shoes, heels or pulling luggage with wheels. The halls echoed. You could hear everyone's conversation. When other people went in their rooms, it seemed like the doors would slam shut. It was very startling in the middle of the night to wake up with loud thumps and slams. At times it sounded like they were trying to get into our room, but they were not. The last negative would be the location. Hotel Portamaggiore is not really close to any landmarks. You can take bus 105 to the main station. I think it is called Termini Station (about a 5 minute ride) then get on the subway or take a bus transfer. We got an all day pass for the bus, train and subway and it was four euros. That's a pretty good deal, especially if you are trying to do the city on your on. If you are like me and the hotel is only used for showering a sleeping then you would be satisfied with this choice. I hope you don't have the bathroom flooding experience.

First of all, I had to spend DOUBLE what I was spending at the B&B... paying 125 Euro for a single accommodation. There was a time constraint and very few options available to me... so, I snapped it up. The room was small. And the walls were in need of a serious paint-job. Once you get past the very nice lobby and reception area, the halls and rooms are kind of shabby.... but, the furnishings inside are modern and very clean. Beds are comfortable... and despite the noisy area, new windows blocked most of the outside noise. Good cable. Then, I took a shower.... OY! Although everything was clean and the hot water was plentiful, within 3 minutes of my shower, the teeny tiny shower backed-up... I was knee-deep in water that was spilling out into the bathroom. When I stepped out to investigate, I noticed a secondary drain in the center of the bathroom.... that all the excess water was draining neatly into.... So, it appears that this was all expected.... the shower backs-up and the water drains via the center of the bathroom! All this is fine, but to go back into the bathroom later to use the toilet, be prepared to wade through whatever water is still on the floor. Excellent buffet-style breakfast with juices, pastries, fruit, cereal and cold meats / cheese for sandwiches. Coffee is by machine (not great). If you ABSOLUTELEY INSIST on a hotel experience, this isn't a bad place. I just found my B&B to be equally or more comfortable for half the price (with a fully-functional shower - LOL). This hotel seems to cater to tour bus goups and the like... so, maybe there are better deals to be had here.

You will need the entire day to see any major attractions so we were out by 0800 and in by 2000, so the hotel accomodations were sufficient to us not to mention the fact that we brought 3 kids along.

The garden terrace was also nice place to be in the evenings. The staff was helpful, friendly and multilingual. The location could be better.. there is actually pretty heavy traffic going on outside the hotel... but the windows are new and keep the noise well outside. Walking time for example to Colosseum was only 15 minutes. And if you don't want to walk, there are six tramlines passing the hotel front. There are some nice restaurants just near by the hotel.

Sadly the bath towels are bath sheets but they were clean each dayand there were plenty. The hotel is an easy walk from the Collaseum and the centre of Rome.

This hotel is on the far side of town, not really close to anything. However, public transportation is close by. The subway is a few blocks over and the street cars stop right across the street. This hotel has long winding hallways and misplaced room numbers. I stayed in room 3N and my parents stayed in 3P. I believe these are some of the newer rooms in a newer wing of the hotel. We looked at 4 rooms before we settled on these. The other ones were smelly and old. The bathrooms were OK. They had bedets in them if that's your thing. The showers were small and so were the beds. I believe the beds were actually smaller than US twin size beds. This hotel is mainly situated in a residential area. I found it hard to find decent places to eat and just have a drink. Most shops and restaurants close around 9 or 10pm so after that, you're out of luck. However, on the last night I found an all night hamburger/ hot dog stand on the other side of the train tracks. It served the purpose in a crunch. Overall, this hotel was OK. Besides, you're not staying in the room all day anyway. I felt safe around hotel, safer than downtown or on the Metro. You live and you learn. Make the best of it. The daily breakfast buffet is a European one. Don't come looking for hot food or fruit -only sliced meats and cheeses. ( I hate this!!!!) Oh! And forget any TV or Cable- it's all in Italian. Ciao!!!

Except for one individual who worked in the late night, he was amazing at providing infomation. The day staff was somewhat clueless.
