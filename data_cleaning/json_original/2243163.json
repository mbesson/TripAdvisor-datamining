Trying to minimise roaming expenses, my husband tried calling me on the land line on numerous occasions only to listen to the phone either ring out, or to be diverted to a voice mail that said \"Sorry, but this line is currently not available\" (!!!). Yes, that was their main outside phone line. When he finally was able to get someone (and he wasn't always lucky I might add), when he asked to speak to me he was told that a person with that name wasn't staying in the hotel. Only when he gave my room number was he finally put through. But even when I tried to ring the front desk from my room, it simply rang out. When I told the front desk (in person), they didn't seem too concerned. How can you get something so incredibly simple, but equally vital, so wrong? The location is great, the rooms are big (albeit with very old fashioned deco), the pool is beautiful. But if they can't answer the phone, I won't be staying there again.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "paris", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in a nice location\u201d", "Author": "alior s", "ReviewID": "UR128165447", "Content": "This hotel is ideally located.

Although I had read mostly excellent reviews about it, the staff didn\u2019t make a good first impression. I contacted the hotel on 2 occasions (via the Agoda booking form as well as via email) prior to my arrival with an early check-in request (seeing that I would be on a 13 hour flight), but didn\u2019t receive a response within the first two weeks. It was only after calling them, that I received a reply, in which they noted that early check-in is subject to room availability and that I could ensure that my room was available by booking the night before against the full daily rate. Although I can understand that this might be hotel policy, I found it hard to believe that all 254 deluxe rooms would have been booked, so I decided to take my chances. I arrived in the hotel around 7am and was indeed told that my room wasn\u2019t ready yet and that I had to wait in the lobby. The reception staff apologized for the inconvenience and offered me free bottled water. It was only until around 10 am however, that they were able to check me-in, and this was only because I insisted that a room should be available now as I had just seen someone check out 15 min before. It\u2019s also good to know, that they ask for a 50SGD guarantee on your credit card. This is just in case you use something from the minibar (which was only stocked with Tiger beer, coca cola and sprite I might add). Although there are two free bottles of mineral water in the room (restocked daily). Finally in my room, I noticed that I had accidentally left behind my camera. The good thing was that the manager handled this issue swiftly and efficiently. As it turns out, I had left behind my camera in the elevator and the manager returned it to me himself within less than 10 min. My room (1513) was clean, big and spacious with a light d\u00e9cor. The bathroom only had a shower, but was very clean and extremely spacious as well, with great water pressure and an adjustable showerhead. The room also had a very beautiful skyline view over Singapore. Housekeeping did an excellent job. Every time I went out and switched on the please make up room button, the room was swiftly cleaned and toiletries were fully restocked when I got back in I had booked a deluxe room promo with free wifi. I was able to go online, but the connection seemed excruciatingly slow during, what may have been, certain peak hours. There\u2019s a small gym, sauna and swimming pool on the 3rd floor, which are all open from 7am-9pm, which I thought was a definite plus. There\u2019s also a restaurant/ caf\u00e9 on the third floor, which offers an American as well as Continental breakfast, against reasonable prices (around 17 SGD). Another pro is the excellent location, within a 5 min walking distance from Tanjong Pagar MRT and several shops (incl. 7-eleven, supermarket and a small fruit market). The staff effiency/service can really be improved on though. I had booked a day tour with an 8 am pickup. Having waited 10 min. in my room, I decided to go down to the lobby and inform the reception desk that I was expecting someone from a tour agency. It was only then that they informed me that the driver was already waiting outside! A call to my room would have been nice though. All in all, I would rate this hotel as average. They have got a lot going for them, but at the same time there is definitely room for improvement. I did like the nice atmosphere. I really got the feeling that they respected my privacy (staff was very friendly without being too pushy).", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cWall is thin\u201d", "Author": "MJFORFUN", "ReviewID": "UR126260506", "Content": "All the previous comments about the hotel are true, good value, large room, clean and convenient but the wall is thin, if your neighbor is loud you could hear their conversation as most of the rooms are connecting.

I stayed January 5th to January 9th. I have previously stayed in the Amara hotel which is just around the corner, (both are around 3 minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT station) and was a little concerned when I found out I was staying in the Orchid due to some renovations being undertaken at the Amara. The Orchid is considerably smaller than the Amara and nowhere near as \"grand\". However, it is perfectly adequate for a short stay. The staff are friendly and the rooms large and modern, (the hotel is new!) The swimming pool is nice - an open air terrace pool and the gym whilst very small, (just 1 treadmill, a stairmaster, and a bike and some weights), is perfectly adequate - I was the only person in there on each of the four occasions I used it. Where the hotel does not score well is with their breakfasts. They are quite frankly rather poor. If you want western food, there are some fried eggs which typically are cold, some scrambled eggs and some croissants/pastries. The selection of pastries is very small. For more eastern food, there are some noodles, (rather greasy) and some rice which is quite nice and one or two other bits and bobs. The juice is not freshly squeezed but rather tastes as if it is from concentrate. The food is ok for a short stay but if I was staying any longer than a week then it would get painfully monotonous - and as I suggested the quality of the food is not great either, (at least at breakfast - I did not try lunch or dinner). The location of the hotel is great - so close to the MRT station and a short walk into Chinatown and apparently the price is just about half that of the Amara. A made to order omlette bar would be a great addition to the breakfasts and would be relatively inexpensive to add too.

We were initially underwhelmed, as the hotel certainly did not give the impression of being very classy and the reception staff were not very welcoming and didn't speak very good English either. The bellboy was fine though. The room however was a pleasant surprise. It was of course clean, being a new hotel and all, but it was also modern looking and comfortable. The bathroom flooring was the most interesting aspect, as the tiles appeared to be made of leather and were really nice to walk on as they are soft and don't get cold. Beds were decent, if not outstanding, but for the price it was good enough. Internet service provided was adequate if not blazing fast. The breakfast was awful though, not much to choose from and most of the Asian dishes were extremely salty to the point of being inedible. Definitely skip this. All in all, the positives for Orchid Hotel are its proximity to the MRT as well as its comfortable rooms. Negative points would be the breakfast and the reception staff. One of my colleagues had a great deal of difficulty communicating with them as he was trying to check out, so that definitely needs improvement.
