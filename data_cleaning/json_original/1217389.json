I don't know why they call it a B&B either since they barely have room to prepare any breakfast and no one in their right mind would ever eat here anyway. The room was very dirty. Our linens were clean but I spoke with two other guests who had to sleep on dirty linens. The bathroom was disgusting and small. The shower was ice cold for about the first 8 minutes however you couldn't let it run because the drain was backed up. There was rarely toilet paper but after searching the kitchen I found where they stashed it. I wish I could give this place a negative star.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "hlv9886", "Title": "\u201cABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING\u201d", "Author": "hlv9886", "ReviewID": "UR31510820", "Content": "I normally never write reviews but this place was so bad that I feel obligated to warn travelers to NEVER STAY HERE!! We booked this place despite the bad review thinking that we just needed a place to sleep but should have just booked at a hostel. Our room was supposed to have a private bathroom but the bathroom was not in the room but outside, and we shared it with the 2-3 men who kept gaurd downstairs. They were up at all hours of the night talking and would go in and out of the bathroom at night and in and out of the kitchen, which was right next to the room so we couldn't really leave our room at night. The room was just big enough for a queen sized bed so there was no room to move around. Everything, room and bathroom, was filthy and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. We were thoroughly disgusted with the place but since they made us pay in full in cash upon arrival (without a receipt) we had to stay.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThis place is a hole... don't waste your money\u201d", "Author": "Myszka29", "ReviewID": "UR31017220", "Content": "This is not a hotel. The address given is not the address of where you are taken to. The room was not as presented in the description on Expedia, and smelled like smoke. You leave your key with a guy behind the window, and there is no guarantee that your belongings are safe in the room when you leave. They only take cash, so you have so assurance that you have a credit card backing you, and you pay directly to the hotel as soon as you arrive. There are so many other great places in the area, that cost slightly more but at least you get what you pay for.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Medena", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1217389-Reviews-Medena-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Carrer d'En Roig 23</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1217389", "ImgURL": ""}}
