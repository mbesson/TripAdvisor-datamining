I pre booked a hairdresser to do a wash and Blow dry, As the hairdressers at the Hotel was closed in August they offered to bring in a local hairdresser just 10 mins away to my room. At no point did they tell me the cost and I did not ask as I assumed it would be on the high side but an acceptable price. I was charged for 22 minutes 150 Euros paid in Cash. To give you a comparison I had the same service at the Four Seasons in Provence in June of this year and was charged 75 Euros. Half the price. I am wondering how much commisiion was paid for this appointment!! 2. I urgently needed my 2 dresses for the evening pressed, they had a couple of creases from the flight. This took about 30 minutes, I understand it is termed under 2 hours service and there is a charge but could not beleive it the next day when I was charged 175 Euros. This was just 50 Euros under the cost of the room!!! I have since checked with two General Managers of 5 star Hotels in London ( Friends of mine) and they have agreed that the max they would charge is about 70 Euros.

The price for a vodka and tonic was 22 Euros, or nearly $30 for one drink. Are you kidding me? We didn't spend one penny on food or drink at the hotel after that, just on principle. We did, however, have breakfast each morning as part of our package. Unfortunately, the food, coffee and service in this beautiful dining room were all extremely poor. Also, the entire lobby reeks of some sort of cheap scent, sort of like that carpet cleaning powder you sprinkle when you have something to cover up, and by the end of the stay it was making us gag. Next, the fitness center is a joke, with a few Elipticals in a hallway. Finally, the room, suite #101, was right next to the service elevator, and starting around 7 or 8 in the morning it was impossible to sleep.

The bathroom was rather small for a 5-star hotel and some of the fittings looked decades old. However, the towels were thick and the biggest I've come across - at double the size of a regular large bath towel. On the plus side, the room had absolute silence and was completely dark with the curtains drawn, helping to ensure a good night's sleep. A selection of pillow types was available, which housekeeping delivered to the room on request. The in-room Sony LCD TV (seemingly the most modern part of the hotel) had a large number of channels including ones in English (with BBC, ITV and some Sky channels), German and Spanish.

Room was on the top floor, down multiple halls, with a view of an ugly wall about 20 feet away from the window. A/C did not work well so we were forced to open the window to get some fresh air. The free wi fi was non existent and I was forced to sit in a tiny cubicle to check in for our flights and check email which took about 45 minutes. There were many other people in and out of the business center with the same issue. (The business center was 2 cubicles with computers almost as old as the hotel).

We are quite young (late 20s) and found the almighty Ritz to be an opulent, beautiful grand hotel. We had concerns as we had been told stories of snobby staff (this must be the ultimate sin the service industry in my opinion, but then Spain is not a service-orientated country) and a garish deco in need of an update but we found its decadence and opulence very uplifting and somehow entertaining. Good Points; Great location for a visit to Madrid's most accomplished museums and other leisure activities, great service, complimentary cakes and bottled water in the room, spacious wardrobes and baths, lush heavy robes and good beds. Bad Points: Lacked some toiletries I'd expected to find such as a toothbrush or a shaving kit and the body bream had noticeably been used and most annoyingly the room service kept attempting to clean the room even though my partner, who had left early to work, had indicated that I would be sleeping in the room. In one occasion they didn't even knock on the door before entering which I found really odd. They did profusely apologized for this in reception and it could have helped to hang the 'do not disturb' sign so it's all forgiven and I would most definitely go back anytime.

We stayed at the Ritz for three nights. The reservation, made via the hotel website, was for a de luxe room with city view. Arrival and check-in: Upon arrival by taxi from the airport, there was nobody at the door to greet us and help with the luggage: The doormen were very busy with guests arriving in a private limo. First impressions count... Check-in went smoothly and we headed off to our room (unaccompanied) on the 6th floor. It was a very dark, small room with courtyard view. As we booked a room with city view, this couldn't be the right room. The check in clerk apologised and changed the room, but we had to wait for over half an hour before it was ready. During that time, the drinks were on the house. The check-in clerk accompanied us to our room, on the second floor. The room: A nice, spacious and well appointed room, with small hallway, two large cupboards, a small desk, one easy chair, a big bathroom with two sinks, bath, a separate shower and separate WC, The view was absolutely great: Overlooking the Prado Museum. The positives of the room: The wonderful view, the comfortable beds and completey sound proof when the windows were closed. Satellite tv with 50+ channels. Free internet was part of our package and worked perfectly fine. The negatives: Renovation going on in the next room: Very noisy during the daytime. The a/c made a very loud banging and humming sound. Fortunately, the weather was such that we didn't have to use it. Room and bathroom quite dark. Shower had no light and the big showerhead was quite low, so all in all rather claustrofobic. The separate WC was so small, that even a person of average height like myself couldn't properly sit down.. Slightly too many negatives for the price you have to pay... Restaurant: Breakfast buffet was included. As we went down to have breakfast the first morning (Friday) at apr. 9.00, we had to wait our turn to get into the restaurant and it took about 20 minutes!!! Absolutely unheard of to have to be standing in line for such a period of time. They should have opened the annex as well, as they did the following days. Buffet was very good, with an abundance of choice. The next two days we had an early breakfast at 07.30, so no problem getting a table. The lobby/bar is opulent, but not very cosy. Bright lights and a little too \"posh\" to our taste. Walk to the (Westin)Palace Hotel across the square and have a drink in their beautiful lobby-bar with glass-stained dome. Absolutely lovely! Staff and concierges: The first night the concierge couldn't find our roomkey when we returned to the hotel. It took him 10 minutes to find it and afterwards he practically blamed us for not having it placed in the right keybox when leaving the hotel. He really had an arrogant attitude. All in all however, staff were courteous and friendly. In many reviews I read about the fact that the concierges and doormen knew the guests by their name, but not in our case: many times we had to tell them our name and roomnumber. In most hotels they offer umbrella's when it's raining, but there didn't seem to be any available, or the concierges and doormen were unwilling to give them out. I gave up, after asking for an umbrella twice. Housekeeping very good. Clean sheets every day, twice a day towel change and of course turn-down service. The second day we got a fruit basket and found a small complimentary bottle of water next to our bedsides. Probably because of the room change, such was forgotten the first day. Overall: The first morning when we opened the windows, we were startled by very loud noises from the street. It turned out to be from protesters holding a demonstration at the hotel entrance, from 08.00 till 22.00. They were former employees of the hotel, who were laid off. The sound they made was deafening. It seems they hold such a protest once or twice a week! On the Sunday we were leaving, the finish of the Vuelta (cycling) was going to take place oppsite the hotel. Everything was closed around the hotel: Major roads, roadblocks everywhere etc. We had to leave very early for the airport, because taxi's were not allowed near the hotel after 10.00 am. It would have been nice to have been warned about this, when making the booking. All in all: The Ritz is still the Grand Old Lady of Madrid. Prices are very high and you expect everything to be in perfect order, but during our stay, there were too many flaws. The location of the hotel is perfect. Visit the Prado, Reina Sofia and/or Thyssen-Bornemiza Museums all within 5 to 8 minutes walking distance. Take the tourbus around the corner of the hotel, which will drive you through either \"old\" or \"modern\" Madrid, but beware: The city is undergoing major construction: Practically every major road is under construction! Still: Madrid is well worth a visit and the location of the Ritz can't be beaten.

Since then I have traveled to Spain multiple times and have taken pictures of the hotel from the outside and always took a peek in the lobby during my visits, but could never afford to stay.

Although everything was spotless and the staff was wonderful, the hotel, and I understand these are challenging economic times, needs a little tlc. I hope the Ritz is careful in taking care of this delicate city heirloom. The hotel has a presence that is so fine, so unique that a restoration not done with care can unleash the years of carefully developed historical patina. Aside from that, what can I say that hasn't been said already? The location is magical! Retiro Park and the Prado are a stone throw away. You can walk to great food on Huertas and spectacular boutique shopping in Salamanca is just down the road (although be forewarned Salamanca\u2019s Calle Serrano seems to be in major construction!)

I had a pleasant stay. Below, my report as follows: The room: furnished classic style with dark furniture (a desk with a chair, a cabinet with a Sony-flat-screen TV on top (access to BBC/CNN), a seat, a large comfortable bed with 2 bedside-tables, decorated in dark yellow-gold-burgundy shades. There were also 2 large wardrobes in the room, one with a number of drawers inside (and huge enough to hold my trolley), the other one contained the safe and a bar with hangers). The minibar was next to the entrance door on the right. Everything looked nice apart from the carpet which appeared a little worn. There were lots of switches on the walls and I found the lighting of the room quite confusing to operate. The bathroom: grey marble, 2 sinks, a tub with a shower curtain. A door separated this room from a smaller one with the bidet and the toilet in it . Behind the door there were hooks with two bathrobes (I found 2 pairs of fluffy white slippers in the wardrobe on top of the drawers). I was given 2 large thick bathtowels and a number of smaller ones per day. The toiletries were a mix of l Occitane (soap) and Bulgari (shampoo, shower gel, conditioner) and there were also shower caps and a small vanity-pack (Q-tips, plaster, etc.) The bathroom was well maintained and spotlessly clean. The golden veneer was partly rubbed off the taps and railings, though, which made the stainless steel underneath it become visible. As mentioned above my room faced the courtyard and was shadowy in the afternoon which turned out to be a blessing in the suffocating Madrid August heat. The courtyard is decorated with neatly arranged trees in flower pots, sitting on an artificial lawn carpet. As it was relatively cool in my room I could switch off the clima and leave the windows open all day and night. Apart from a soft humming sound (not noisier than the clima and probably comming from the fans) the atmospere was peaceful and I slept well. The staff: Well trained, most attentive and friendly but also keeping a certain distance without appearing aloof or condescending as they sometimes behave in the high-category hotels . (The concierge remembered my room number after just having met me once, when I stopped for a second on my way through the lobby thinking \"Have I packed the camera ?\" I was immediately approached by a staff member asking if he could help, when the maids learned that I used to spend most of the day in my room (thanks to the heat...) housekeeping service contacted me and suggested arranging the housekeeping routine according to my personal needs). Housekeeping was generally done so quietly in rooms and corridors next to me that I never felt disturbed during my presence (11 a.m.-16 p.m.) while I was reading, sleeping or watching TV. So if you are looking for a quiet comfortable place to relax in Madrid center, this hotel is for you. Advice: You can walk from the hotel to the historic part of Madrid; a stroll from the Ritz to the Royal Palace took me 30 minutes. Cross Paseo del Prado, walk over to the corner Thyssen museum/Plaza de las Cortes and just walk straight on to Plaza del Sol. Then make sure you follow the pedestrian mall Calle de Arenal and at Metro Opera, behind the Theatre, there is the Royal Palace. The Prado is situated directly behind the Ritz (3 minutes walk), best be there already at 9 a.m. or go at lunchtime. Fantastic masterpieces on show (El Greco made my day). Restaurants can be found at Calle de Alcala. When you leave the main entrance of the hotel, turn right and walk up the Paseo del Prado (always in the shadow thanks to the trees) to Plaza de la Cibeles, cross the Paseo del Prado and on the left side (where Bance de Espana is) walk a few metres and there are restaurants. I also had lunch once at a restaurant called \"The WOK\" on the opposite side of Calle de Alcala. It is at Metro Sevilla on Calle Virgen Peligro, behind the Starbucks and offers tasty little Asian meals for just 10-15 Euro. For hotel shuttle I used AeroCity shuttle service, I came across their counter in the arrival hall. I strongly recommend them, I bought my voucher at their counter at 46 Euro for the return ticket airport-hotel-airport. The mini vans have clima and the service is reliable. Their return shuttle van to the airport arrived at the Ritz on the dot.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portugal", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "elviPortugal", "ReviewID": "UR38631891", "Content": "Well, Ritz is Ritz and it fully justifies it`s name.

Very watery scrambled eggs, cold bacon, no mushrooms or hash browns or baked beans or choice of eggs but the kitchen will prepare what you ask for.

The Personnel is really very professional, efficient and helpful. They reserved tables in restaurants for us, helped with guided tours.... It is a true luxurious hotel & even though the colours on the carpets do look a bit faded what the heck, this is the mythical Ritz Hotel in Madrid after all. The hall, the restaurant and the staircase were much smaller than I thought but then perhaps it's better that way. The lounge is lovely and cosy for aperitifs, after dinner drinks (their Irish coffee is delicious, 16 euros) and for the scrumptious high tea (30 euros per person) , the only restaurant (used for breakfast too) is quite intimate, with silver cutlery. I would have liked the different cheeses to be named at the breakfast buffet to be able to buy the same back home. It\u2019s a shame that there are no Spanish specialities available, (for breakfast & dinner) just international type food. For breakfast we wanted Serrano ham and we were charged 40 euros for one serving. Wi-fi costs 10 euros per hour or 16 euros per day. Go along to the many internet cafes around the area, 1 euro for 15 minutes. A big bottle of whisky or wine at the El Corte Ingles supermarkets will cost the same as a mini bottle in the mini-bar. In fact everything there is very expensive, but then again, you do have the quality and the numerous personnel at your disposal, so you have to know what you really want to pay for. Okay, just to split hairs, I'd say that the brass handle on the toilet door that kept falling off had not been repaired before our arrival (and still kept falling off when we left) and my husband got fed up of seeing the shade on one of the wall lamps all lopsided and put it straight! But that's all, oh yes, there seems to be something missing, a little \"je-ne-sais-quoi\". Even though the hotel's not that big, I never sensed a sort of \u201chome from home\u201d type atmosphere that I've found in other hotels of this genre. Is it because the personnel want to be discrete or is it because it\u2019s the Spanish character? We went to the Westin Palace Hotel, just across the road, for dinner at the ASIS GALLERY RESTAURANT. The food was good but a bit too salty for us & the service was so fast that we had indigestion!! We had hardly ordered drinks than the starters arrived. The plates were taken away as soon as we had put our forks down, the main meal arrived etc etc. The Asian waitresses were not very professional either. The WESTIN PALACE HOTEL is luxurious (the hall and the dining areas) but incomparable to the Ritz. I\u2019d say that the Westin is a 5* hotel but the Ritz is way above. There were people all over the place, talking and laughing loudly, walking around with drinks in their hands and dressed any old way. It\u2019s much bigger than the Ritz. and there wasn\u2019t this classy, hushed type atmosphere than you can find at the Ritz. Even if the RItz may have been full, we had the impression that there weren't very many people around, which is quite relaxing. The concierge at the Ritz suggested we go to the CORRAL DE LA MOREIRA to watch the best flamenco dancing in town. The spectacular quality of the show made up for the lousy food and rushed service, everyone being crushed like sardines into this big room and the waitress who dropped a creamy fish sauce down my husband\u2019s jacket and hadn\u2019t even noticed! The price of the \u201cfood\u201d & show came up to 200 euros for the two of us, much too expensive for the quality of the food. Get there early in order to eat quickly and concentrate on the brilliant performance of the flamenco troupe. The Ritz is close to everything, no need to hire a car or get a taxi. Get to the Prado museum very early or else beware of queuing for ages and being crushed in the crowd in the actual visiting areas. We went back to the airport with the hotel\u2019s limousine service, 100 euros but a taxi will cost you 30 euros.

An hour later we were told the room was ready. We were lead to a room, supposedly a deluxe room, before we entered the room we were told how lucky we were to have such a room, as in the opinion of the hotel employee it was one of the best rooms in the hotel. We nearly fell over when he opened the door. Deluxe? not even D! Frankly this room bore NO resemblance to any on the website, standard or deluxe! If they put this room on the website no one would ever stay at the Ritz Madrid. Also as part of our package we would receive a bottle of cava. As we had changed our allocated room we were told the bottle of cava would be brought round to our new room, which wasn\u2019t much better than the first. Faded elegance is one thing but this had bits missing or very worn furniture. After three reminders, the night we arrived, the next morning and the morning after, 2 1/2 days later, our cava turned-up. On the first night they did not 'turn-down' or tidy our room. I asked them if this was usual, apparently yes! Also part of our package was a meal in the Goya dinning room. We could only have the set menu, which happened to be the same as the 'specials'. Yes the rubbish all restaurants pass-off as 'special'; the ingreadiance on or passed the sell by date. The car organised for our departure was waiting for us as we waited to be told it had arrived.

As far as location is concerned the hotel is ideal and across the road from the Westin Palace hotel (which probably would have been our first choice but didn't seem to have availability for the time we were there even though I was looking to book months ago) We got a good rate with TravelRepublic (cheaper than the hotel website) who I had never booked with before Anyway, having booked the Ritz I was pleased with the decision despite a number of reviews commenting upon the decor,etc around the hotel. We got there a little early but the staff invited us to have a drink (on the house) in the garden terrace whilst the room was being prepared. We were then escorted to our room (non-smoking) which was on the top floor. I must that say that given the number of previous reviews I have read regarding standard of rooms - I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure whether this was the case due to being slightly out of the main tourist season. The room was bigger than I expected with built in wardrobes, the furniture was of a reasonable standard and in keeping with a traditional hotel. The bathroom was fine if not slightly small compared to the size of the room but no matter. The room had a TV/DVD - and (unlike any of the other hotels in Madrid it appears) with English speaking channels (BBC; Sky news; CNN this certainly made a difference) The hotel breakfast was perfectly adequate and the staff were attentive and polite at all times. We noticed a number of other residents walking around in jeans/t-shirts in the day but for dinner those dining in the restaurant the men did all have ties/jackets. We didn't eat at the hotel - the food was pricey and we prefered to head to the sol area which was only 10-15mins walk away. We did however do high tea at the Ritz (well you've got to haven't you) and had evening drinks in the lobby which was pleasant. There was a turndown service every evening with the maid leaving little chocolates, fruit, even a cake on our arrival! They didn't start cleaning too early in the morning either which is what I have read about some hotels This hotel is not cheap but with most things in life you get what you pay for and having walked around the city and seen the various locations of the hotels I had considered booking I was glad I decided to go for the Ritz. Those on the noisy Gran Via would be fine if you are young and with a group of frends, I guess. If you want a more hip and trendy hotel then the nearby Villa Real and Urban looked ok but the location and the little extras at the Ritz are what really set this hotel (and probably the Palace) apart from the others downtown. The 3 musems were very nearby, the Prado is literally across the road. I would recommend you get there early. The Royal Palace is a little further away but within walking distance. The Retiro park is also across the road and made for a nice afternoon stroll. There were a surprising number of Starbucks coffee shops dotted around the city so we were never far from a coffee break. Take a trip to the Plaza Mayor - it is by far the biggest square where everybody seems to congregate in the evenings or have a quiet drink in Plaza Santa Ana.

The service throughout our stay was passable although checkout turned into a bit of a circus with delayed bellman and apparently only one person at the front desk capable of resolving a billing error. Check your bill as there were two random charges posted to our account that were not ours. The breakfast room was lovely, although on the small side so crowded in the morning. The food was indifferent and the buffet was laid out in various stations which was the tiniest bit annoying.

We were shown to our room, which we were told had beautiful views as it was on the top floor. The view was indeed beautiful, if I stood on a chair to look out of the window. As we were in a room which was effectively in the roof space. About 2/3 of the room had a ceiling so low, we could not stand up. The room was very dark as it had one tiny window in what was quite a large room. The bathroom was well equipped but small. We complained this was not a room in which we could possibly spend 4 nights. We were then advised the reason we had been put in that room was that the President of the Philippines (and her massive entourage) had stayed on a night longer than expected. We were advised that we were lucky not to have been sent to another hotel as other guests had. We were told if we could bear with them just one night they would put us in the room which was originally intended for us! We did stay and our replacement room was wonderful. 5th floor with great views. Again, the bathroom was tiny but well equipped. The concierge desk was not good. Whilst polite and friendly, they sent us to a restaurant which was not open on a Monday. We ended up eating at the small neighbourhood restaurant a few doors away with only 2 other diners. They also made a reservation in a smoking area when we had specifically asked for non-smoking. I would have put it down to the restaurant but upon return I asked the concierge who looked at the note pad and it revealed The Ritz had asked for a smoking section. My biggest problem with this hotel was service, or the lack of it. Despite our dodgy first night which was understandable in the circumstances, the hotel made up for that. However, there was just no service. Concierge was not good, the staff not very friendly and other than eventually getting a nice room, there is very little to do there as there is no pool, the gardens are given to the restaurant so one cannot just relax in them without paying a fortune for drinks/food you do not want but are obliged to order. We were asked not to sit in the gardens unless we were drinking/dining. Having stayed at The Ritz, London and dined at The Ritz, Paris; Ritz Madrid is just not in their league.

After an average arrival and check-in I was somewhat disturbed by the twin-bedded double room with two single beds (that I hadn't requested at reservation stage and that were tiny) and by the fact that it presented itself in generally poor condition. In addition to the room being dark and very faded, the carpet was worn and dirty and the furniture in desperate need of re-upholstry, whilst most surfaces appeared to last have been dusted prior to Franco's coming to power. It being late, I not only decided to not make a fuss about the room, but also not to try and find an open restaurant and therefore opted for room service. A Club Sandwich, some sliced fruit and a bottle of Evian strikes me as an order that is possibly processed 5 million times a day across thousands of hotels around the world and that requires little culinary expertise. Although the delivery was timely, the quality of the sandwich was simply hideous. I will spare you the details but suggest to opt out of Room Service, given that the anti-climactic food experience comes paired with an obscene price tag ( In my case \u20ac68). Although my 7.30 wake up call never arrived, my \u20ac3 local newspaper did. Shame I couldnt read it with a coffee, for its neither offered nor available as part of the wake up call (if I had received it) in absence of in-room facilities. Anxious to get my first caffeine fix, I went to the breakfast restaurant and was seated in a very pleasant terrace area, looking forward to catching up on proper food. In summer the terrace provides a beautiful backdrop and is enjoyable, though traffic noise is continuous. Did I say opt out of Room Service? Make that \"Opt out of eating and drinking. Fullstop.\" The coffee I received (after asking for it twice) tasted like washing liquid and the canned orange juice was a close match. The selection and quality of food on the makeshift and improvised looking buffet scattered around the room was simply pathetic. Admittedly, breakfast is an issue in 9 out of 10 hotels (though it really isnt that difficult), but The Ritz has entered my personal hall of fame for the worst hotel breakfasts ever. The staff at breakfast very much appears untrained and are being commandeered by old waiters in ill-fitting and worn uniforms.

The wallpaper was dark and dinghy and the bed was the smallest double I have ever seen. Looking forward to a grand and exceptional hotel, my disappointment could not be contained. It is a hotel that has passed its expiration date. Once I am sure it was a glorious property; however it has seen its last days and is beginning to show all signs of ageing very quickly. After one night of sleeping on top of each other for lack of space in the smallest double I have seen, we checked out the next morning in search of other accomdations. The hotel is very overpriced for what you receive.", "Date": "January 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cFive Star with a sting!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4251734", "Content": "Just enjoyed two nights in a deluxe double at The Ritz Madrid as a celebration for my wife's birthday while visiting Europe. Firstly, lets establish that the Ritz Madrid is not connected to any other \"Ritz\" hotels in London and Paris...this is not part of a chain, it is just a name. The place is a slightly faded five star that has seen better days. However, they make up for this with exceptional service and an amazing dining terrace, which would be magnificent in warmer months and perhaps even the best spot in the city. The service was superb. Understated, non-pretentious and friendly...they even have a sense of humour! The public rooms are perfect if you seek the nostalgia of times past. However, this is simply not a place that would appeal to most under 60's!...In fact the lounge is so stuffy that most younger guests would feel very uncomfortable meeting for a drink in the lobby. The other downside is the inflated charges for services. eg: I ordered coffee and toast from the \"a la carte\" menu and they charged 32 euros per person. Any way you look at it, 64 euros for coffee and toast for two is almost criminal! Then there was the 24 euros for a very poor internet connection (Double the rate of other 5 stars in madrid!) A hotel with such high service standards demeans itself with such greedy overcharging for services. They really need to catch up with the approach and style of the five star hotels in Barcelona. But perhaps The Ritz is a better reflection of the style of Madrid.", "Date": "December 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cNot Ritz at its best\u201d", "Author": "agro", "ReviewID": "UR4241691", "Content": "In a nuthshell: not Ritz at its best.

The T.V. set had an endearing habit of switching itself on loudly at various hours during the night! On the plus side the staff are absolutely marvellous - ultra polite, friendly and very helpful.

We stayed in July with our 3 children (ages 9, 6, and 1) and were very happy. We had reserved two connecting deluxe doubles. The rooms were on the first floor, quite spacious, clean, elegantly decorated - with a view from french doors out to the side street. Yes - it is expensive - but no more so than any other major city hotel. I found the service very prompt and very professional. My children (and believe me - the toddler is a devil!) were also treated quite well. I had made two requests via e-mail to the concierge - one for tickets to a bullfight, one for a private driver/guide for a morning of sightseeing. Both requests were handled seemlessly. And finally as regards the staff - my Spanish is fairly basic - but (unlike my experiences in Italy) when I spoke to any staffmember in Spanish - they politely responded in Spanish as well - this is very important to me - because part of the enjoyment of traveling is practicing a foreign language. However, when my husband (who is terrible with languages) spoke in English - they responded to him in English. Everyone was polite and professional.

The first room we were shown - 501 had twin beds while a king bed had been confirmed. We had a miserable \"complimentary\" dinner in their Goya restaurant. My husband had to leave the restaurant, go to Reception for a \"coupon\" that we should have been given at check in. He didn't have the confirmation letter with him so I had to leave the restaurant, go back to the room and retrieve it. Went back to Reception and they finally decided that we did have the dinner coming. They then gave me the \"coupon\". We were then given a one sheet paper menu with 2 courses while everyone else in the restaurant had huge menus with many choices. We asked for another menu and they said that was all there was. The complimentary appetizer was actually a piece of the canelloni that was the same as the entree. No garnish, no vegetable. Just a overly rich foie gras with 8 green beans for the 1st course and 4 very rich and tiny canelloni for the 2nd course. A bottle of wine was included - we needed it. Felt like second class citizens. Breakfast was the same - had to produce the confirmation letter - buffet breakfast daily was included. Our last night we had a late night drink in the \"garden\" so we could hear the piano. The street noise was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves talk. Oh yes, our room - was beautiful - service was great but we were in 301 - adjoining an exterior wall where they were doing major construction from 8 in the morning to 8 at night. Jackhammers and concrete drilling. Our bathroom window nearly had the scaffolding in it. We had dinner one night at the Palace Hotel. They were very gracious. We would stay there again if ever in Madrid. We did go to Botin Restaurant - oldest restaurant in the world. Had roast suckling pig. A great dinner. Also, went to a bullfight. Quite an experience.
