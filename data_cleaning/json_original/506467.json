{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good business hotel This Ikebukuro hotel is about 5 min walk from Exit 35 of Ikebukuro station. Surrounded by shops and eateries and very convenient. We booked a triple room for 2 adults and 2 children. The toilet and bathroom is small (as expected) but the room is clean and hotel staff can understand English. Willing to keep our baggage for a few days when we travel out of Tokyo. The lobby area has 2 free to use PCs with internet connection.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR967354443", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "LizAwa"}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue76c\u5057\u9288\u6c47\u5063\u9288\u581b\u4ed0\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9286?#x201d;   showReview(19171717, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR692627659", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d506467-r22567132-Ikebukuro_Theatre_Hotel-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "506467", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
