A doss-house, more like!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "RapidAssistant", "ReviewID": "UR126316404", "Content": "Not trying to let the fact that I stayed in the Waldorf Towers in New York just three weeks earlier cloud my judgement - it quickly became apparent that I had indeed gone from the greatest hotel experience in my life to one of the very worst. I ended up here as part of a Superbreak package deal (like many others, no doubt), so the actual cost of the room is unclear. Nonetheless, what follows makes very disappointing reading. Where do I start? The list is almost endless. To begin with, I got stung with Travelodge\u2019s charge for storing baggage in a locker for \u00a310, or check-in early before \u00a310. Clearly Ryanair-style holding to ransom of people who have no other choice. The hotel building itself is clearly one that was a bit more upmarket originally (I guess it was maybe a Holiday Inn or something) and Travelodge have \u201cinherited\u201d it judging by the corridors and the rooms themselves. And the room, well lets see - scuffed, tatty and very dated furniture, skirting boards with holes in them from where a radiator had been removed, strange electrical fitments on the walls which were now obsolete and no longer used, an early 1980s-vintage radio built into the bedside cabinet that had most of its knobs missing (and didn\u2019t work anyway), the bathroom you couldn\u2019t take a shower in because the plunger on the tap was broken off, there were missing light bulbs above the towel rail (thus exposing LIVE electrical connections), dirty, corroded taps and plugholes on the sink and bath, cracked tiles, peeling paint, mildew on the ceiling - and the light above the mirror in the bathroom had an old candle style bulb (which was burnt out anyway). As for the bed, the mattress was shot, and sagged in the middle. At least they had recently fitted double glazing\u2026.about the only plus point I could find. The final straw was the kettle hadn\u2019t been cleaned for months, in fact someone had flicked cigarette ash into it and it had been left - it was so disgusting my partner actually vomited after seeing the inside. Livid, we demanded to see the manager (and presented the aforementioned kettle\u2026.on the deskin front of all the other customers). The poor junior on the desk who had to take our wrath went into his/her office for a bit and came back and offered us a refund on the spot. Fair enough - we couldn\u2019t present our credit card to accept a refund because we had made our booking through Superbreak and we had to go via them. But it speaks volumes that the management wouldn\u2019t come out of their office and face us. Disgusting treatment - and to put a junior member of staff out there to do their dirty work\u2026.even worse. So all in all a pretty miserable experience, and yes indeed - there is the argument \u201cwhat do you expect for \u00a335\u201d - but I can tell you that St Pancras Youth Hostel a mere half a kilometre away, is \u00a318 a night and is spotlessly clean and well kept, and I have used it for years. And to think if you had paid the standard \u00a380-\u00a390 Central London rate for a hotel of this classification (as some earlier reviewers have indeed done), you\u2019d feel pretty ripped off. I\u2019ve stayed in some of the little independents in the King\u2019s Cross area - they can be a bit hit and miss as well, admittedly, but none have been quite as bad as this. So how do they get away with it?? Firstly, given Travelodge have four hotels in the immediate vicinity (I have stayed in the one next to Euston Station, and it was perfectly OK, if you read my earlier review), the alarm bells should have been ringing when you look at the Travelodge website and this one is consistently the easiest to get the el-cheapo rates in. Most of the clientele appear to be school trip parties, foreigners on package holiday deals and stag/hen dos. Clearly the management are working to the law of averages that the vast majority of customers (mostly those who can\u2019t speak English) are likely to put up and shut up, whilst just take the hit and refund those that will actually complain. So there are better hotels in this area - there are better Travelodges in this area even - but I can\u2019t understand how a big national chain can get away with this. I really don\u2019t.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as we expected\u201d", "Author": "Susan2309", "ReviewID": "UR126002820", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights from 8.3.12.

We ended up getting an \u00c2\u00a385 rate on Travel Republic. The only good thing about this place is the friendliness of the staff. Without exception, they were among the most cheerful I've ever met - including the two massive 'bouncers' who patrolled the reception area morning, noon, and night. Why they have to be there on constant guard is another matter. I suspect it's something to do with the hotel's frightful location. Breakfast was good too, but that's where the positives come to an end. The most important factor - the bedroom - was horrible. Peeling wallpaper, graffiti, lights not working, no shampoo etc. There's no way this place was worth the \u00c2\u00a385 my company paid for it. It's barely worth the \u00c2\u00a319 some people manage to get rooms for by booking months in advance. But perhaps the most telling thing about this property was the fact that it was swarming with secondary school students who clearly couldn't care less what their surroundings were like. I suspect they're the mainstay of this hotel on a regular basis. I also suspect they're the hotel's principal source of unsung graffiti artists.

We arrived just after 3pm to check in and there was no queue and walked straight to the desk. The lady on the desk was helpful, however seemed slightly unsure about what we had booked, as she asked us how long we were staying for and what rooms we had booked, even though we had the internet booking conformation with us! We had booked a double room and a family room, the double room was on the 6th floor and was on the smaller size however very clean with a decent size window in bringing light in. The bathroom was again on the smaller size but very clean. The family room appeared to be a disabled room as it had a very wide doors. The room itself was spacious and the bathroom had a wetroom in one half of it. The whole room was very clean also. The only thing which didn't work was the tv remote, which was missing a battery, however we did not bother to ask for one, as we didnt need the tv. The family room was perfect for us, as we all spent time in it together apart from when we went to bed. The room was facing out to the back of the hotel and was generally very quiet, minus the odd siren, or shouting on the street but this was barely notciable. At night we had no problems with noise or other guests heard about 3 doors shut after midnight the whole weekend! The area itself from kings cross to the hotel is reasonable we felt perfectly safe, even coming back at after midnight one night, and 11pm the other.

Was a little traffic noise due to the location, and a few dodgy characters hanging around the area, so exercise hightened caution with bags etc, but it was fine. We were travelling with a young child, and we felt safe enough. The only negative thing was the breakfast, which we had paid extra for. It was served in what could have been a very nice dining area. However, it was like feeding time at the zoo. Food all over the floor, not enough food, not enough plates, cutlery and cups. Really not a good experience. Next time would just book the room-there are lots of places nearby to get a better, more civilised and cheaper breakfast! A tip-use their left luggage facility if you need to leave bags-much much cheaper than the left luggage at Kings Cross station if you don't mind the 10 minute walk to drop off/collect.

I read a lot of the reviews of this hotel after I booked and was a bit apprehensive considering the negativity I'd read but I was quite pleasantly surprised. I'd booked this hotel in the Travelodge sale getting a spectacular deal for central London (under \u00c2\u00a3100 for 4 nights). Travelodge do have another Kings Cross hotel which is nicer looking and much closer to the tube but for me, I just wanted somewhere to sleep and wasn't too fussed on the interior so I settled on the Royal Scot instead. Check in was quick and easy, I was given a room on the top floor (6th) and was happy to find I'd been given a renovated room. My sister stayed in this hotel over five years ago and got a renovated room so it seems it's taking them quite a while to complete the project! Positives: - Clean room - No traffic noise - Breakfast room (I didn't use) - Computers/wi-fi (again, didn't use) Negatives: - The bed was a little uncomfortable and frequently the mattress came away from the wall which was a little annoying but I wasn't paying for a 5* so I let it slip. - The room is showing some signs of wear and tear (marks on the wall etc.) which could quickly be touched up. - The lifts were grimy as other guests have wrote about - The TV in my room frequently switched itself off - Shower wasn't very powerful - And finally, this was my main 'complaint' (as such) during my stay. I tested my shower the night before using it to check the temperature (which was fine) but I noticed that the water was building up in the base. Basically it was clear that the drain was blocked so I went downstairs to tell reception which understandably they couldn't get anyone to sort it as maintenance had gone home. But what did annoy me was that the maid/cleaner obviously wasn't doing his/her job properly as this sort of thing should be checked prior to a new guest's arrival. The receptionist gave me a card to another room to shower in which was a 'Millennium' room on the 2nd floor. I was going to move all of my stuff over and sleep and shower there before moving back to my room the next day, however the receptionist advised against doing so and upon looking at it, I realised why. It was a non-refurbished room on the roadside and was quite a trek to get to. It took me 20 minutes to find from the lift as you had to go through separate corridors and sets of stairs which made the matter worse for me as I had to dash across the hotel at 6am across four floors to get ready for work in the morning. To be fair to the hotel, it was fixed by the time I arrived back the following night, it just inconvenienced me with having to go to work. Overall, it was a mixed stay. It wasn't as bad as what I was expecting and the staff were accommodating. For what I paid, I felt I got my money's worth but as for paying the full price, I don't think I'd stay there. A few small improvements could be made to this hotel to make it slightly better.

As I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my laptop & I needed internet access quickly I used one of the 20 mins for \u00c2\u00a31 terminals in reception. Easy to use though expensive considering that West End internet cafes give you an hour for \u00c2\u00a31. I cannot imagine why anyone would pay \u00c2\u00a37.65 for an English Breakfast even if kids eat for free and even if the quality is good. The reviews on this page suggest it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from good.

The booking system should automatically cope with my need to get the best price for my stay at the time when I make the booking. I shouldn't even need to make separate bookings for each night. After all, it is supposed to be a budget hotel chain, isn't it? The best thing about this hotel is that it serves a hot breakfast. It's a shame though, that it can't compete on either price or quality with the cafes I found about 100 yards from the door. In the room, soap and tea ran out and I had to ask at the desk for replenishment. There was no drain plug for the bath, and the bathroom fan was inoperative. There was no ventilation in the room that I could find. Signposting to room 234 was mostly absent, I only found the room by a process of elimination. Most of the indicator lights on the lifts did not work. There are too few housekeeping staff at this hotel. They were still working on rooms at four and five in the afternoon. Surely they should be finished and clear before the check-in time of three. Staff were pleasant and friendly, although rather unconcerned at the 4a.m. false fire alarm. More sympathy for this disruption would have been appreciated. The staff member on duty when the fire alarm occurred seemed very unsure of himself. He issued inaudible instructions, and his loudhailer merely served to distort his voice to unintelligibility. If there had been a fire, I fear there would have been casualties. I noticed subsequently that the so-called 'alarmed' doors to the emergency exit stairs were being used freely by guests, with no alarm sounding. This surely breaks fire regulations. I spoke to a number of other guests during my stay all of whom expressed resigned disappointment with the quality of the offering.

Travelodge standards vary across hotels and this one, structurally speaking, was very average; however, it is a stone's throw from King's Cross, which is very handy. There's not much to do about the room... it felt like it could do with some refurbishing. Matresses in the room were not particularly good and I woke up with slight back stiffness. Decor wise, the room had an average feel with some dodgy finish on the walls, random spots and a couple of lightbulbs missing. Room and bathroom were clean though. Price wise, I found good that I was able to book any room (single, double or family --which has a double bed plus an additional one) for \u00c2\u00a369. That was cheap and was an incentive for thinking that I would go back if I need to go to London overnight. The room I stayed in was a family room located at the back so not much noise beyond reasonable --ie, groups of lads coming back presumably from a night out. In terms of the room layout, size was good for a couple but for a family room I felt it was small if you have more than one child. The window was of medium size and located rather high up (a child would not be able to look outside), and it has a security device that does not allow it to open more than a few inches. There were two wall radiators that seemed rather old and a bit rusty (I didn't risk trying to work those ones out but felt that I didn't need to either as it was neither cold nor hot). There was a TV (old but worked OK) and a kettle with three cups plus coffee sachets. There was no phone so if anything, you have to do to reception. I paid an extra for WiFi and it worked perfectly. Overall, nothing impressive but got me through the night.

Others have been pretty impressive against Travelodges' widely regarded \"no frills\" reputation, but this one does it no favours. Before I list the many negatives, the few positives; sleep quality - the bed was fairly comfortable, no bed mites etc. There also wasn't much outside noise keeping me awake, only the occasional vehicle siren outside, my room was on the 2nd floor, so maybe people on the 1st floor have it worse. Also, unlike other Travelodges' I have visited, when you book a twin room, you actually get 2 single beds, rather than 1 double and a sofa bed. Onto the negatives, not sure where to start. The room was pretty small, much less spacious than twin rooms in other Travelodges I have stayed in. The bathroom was ridiculously small, literally marginally bigger than one you'd find in a caravan. The room itself was outdated and rundown, and if all rooms in the place are like it, they all need major refurbishment work. The wall paint and carpet looked old, with the paint cracked and peeling in places. One of the wall lamp lampshades had a huge dent in it and the outdated TV (was actually surprised to find had freeview), kept randomly switched itself off, and the power socket was half hanging off the wall.........dodgy!. Finding your room can be fun if you enjoy un-necessarily walking around 60 something rooms before you get to yours. If all floors are planned like the 2nd floor, then their in a horse-shoe shape, with the rooms being the steel shoe, and the lifts being the gap. If your room is numbered highly, i.e 260, 370, rather than 201, 315, to avoid walking around like a idiot for 10 minutes, go through the door on the left when you come out of the lift, as you'll start at the highest numbered room on that floor. If you go, take your own clothes hangers...........seriously. The wardrobe in my room had no clothes hangers, I went to the reception to ask for some, there were none left. That is poor, surely they can afford and be bothered to buy enough clothes hangers for every room in the place??.

I was able to put mine back up, but my colleague had no such luck and in the end went to reception where she was given the key to the room next to mine. When she arrived back, we noticed her arm was black with dirt, presumably from a mix of the window and the curtains. Anyway, the curtains were up at the window in her new room, and her window opened, which was an improvement on mine, as the catch on my window just spun in my hand when I tried to open it. We then discovered there was no remote for her TV. As she had left the door to her original room open, we took the remote from that room but it didn't work. Taking the batteries out and putting them back in the right way did the trick though! I found the shower to be very temperamental and only ran hot now and again, but had plenty of towels as we had taken the ones from the unused room. We both slept ok, but I had a shock when I opened my curtains in the morning (I didn't have a net curtain) to see how close we were to the street, with people walking right past the window.

Paint on corridors and doors and in the lifts was scratched and marked throughout, and the box room I was given had not seen any paint for a number of years.

I tried to use the free wifi in the bar but gave up afte an hour - no problem logging on, but slower than the slowest snail. I decided to have an early breakfast in the hope it would go smoothly- forget it. When I arrived at 07.20 most of the tables had been used and had debris of one sort or another on them - a waitress did later attempt to clear some - why the management do not realise that if they had given her a small trolley it would be so much more efficient and could have carried cleaning materials of which she had none - thus she cleared (some of ) the tales, but did ot clean them. The juice machine dispensed cold water, the supervisor shrugged her shoulders when told, the toaster was on a go slow - you had to put your toast through six times to get it cooked - obviously an energy saving attempt.

No customer service whatsoever, no interaction or sense of human touch. What's the point in having a clerk if a machine would deliver the same service with maybe a bit more options... When we went onto the 6th floor, our room was 672. In the lobby, the signs were showing one way from 650 to 669 (or something like that) and the other way was showing from 680 to 699... SO WHERE IS 672 ?!? We tried the first way to end up at the end of the line and had to go back towards the lift and try the second way... The room was at the en of it. When we entered the room we had to push the door very hard and when I tried to close it I had to play up with the handle and push hard as it wouldn't close properly... That's when I noticed that the door was chipped on the side like if someone tried to kick it open... very reassuring... We settled a bit and though about calling the reception to ask for a lighter duvet... the problem was that there was no pone at all... no customer service on that side too then... We gave up, as we had a long journey and tried to have a shower to discover that there's no soap but the little hand washing one on the side of the sink... Did do the job though... As the evening drew to an end, I tried to close the window and we had to push both of us very hard to get it closed and locked... When we drew the curtains, they just fall as there was nothing to stop them on the rail... Since it was our only way to get the sun out in the morning we just had to put them back on... (and we realised that there was mould all around it) During the night we realised that the window wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t double-glazing even though we were in central London as loads of Police cars went by waking us up and when we tried to leave quietly in the morning we had to slam the door few times to get it to shut properly (same story as the previous night) Thankfully we only paid \u00c2\u00a329 this time and I wish we had paid the \u00c2\u00a319 advertised everywhere but never available (we commute by Kings Cross) I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t advise any of my friends to stay there even with an attractive price...", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Callington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPossibly the worst Travelodge in UK?\u201d", "Author": "VES11", "ReviewID": "UR116748280", "Content": "Avoid this Travelodge like the plague, it is old, scruffy, and full of foreign students.

On this occasion we only paid \u00c2\u00a336 for one night, which, I think is a bargain. Why do I think this? Well one must have to think relatively; if you compare this Travelodge with the majority of dingy King's Cross hotels (you'll pass many of them on your way here) it really isn't so bad, especially if you get a good deal. The room was tired and a little shabby, but was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was also plenty of hot water (low pressure though!) So if all you need is somewhere to lay your head for a night then it isn't too bad. Although the 'real' King's Cross Travelodge is far superior to this place so aim to get that one before this if you need to stay in the King's Cross area.

This was on the 5th floor! My wife went to shut the window and keep him away from there.

There was graffiti in the lifts, and there were hundreds of noisy teenagers running riot in the lobby and on most levels, including on our corridor where we were supposed to be getting a good nights sleep. It was very daunting to be surrounded by such noise and mess. I could hear the noise clearly from our twin room. The beds were smaller than an average single bed although the linen was clean. No wake up call, no hairdryer. The lights blew and we were left with one bedside lamp. The bathroom had mould along the tiles and the bottom of the bath was not dirty but grubby (just needed a spot of bleach) The walls were tatty and I've stayed in better hostels. I really did not feel comfortable at the Royal Scot and I soon realised that it may be quite difficult to get a good nights sleep (if any) I left the building and headed over to the other Travelodge in Kings Cross, on Grays Inn road. A very courteous girl at he desk in the lobby told me that unfortunately they were fully booked and so we couldn't move hotels. Around 11pm, we went straight to bed, despite the noise, which was still loud. I awoke at 05.30 as scheduled, only to discover my colleague had not slept until 03.30. She felt awful and consequently was not able to work the following day. She went back home and I went to Paris by myself. Fulfilling not only my work, but hers too.

We were given our key and vaguely pointing down the room she told us our room was on the second floor. We headed to the three lifts, only one was working. Awesome. When the lift opened, my jaw dropped. It wasn't big enough for my case, let alone two adults and two cases on wheels. We squeezed in & stared at all the grafitti on the walls of the lift. Classy! Lift door opened (which was a relief cos its the kind of lift that you imagine DYING IN). We were glared at by cleaner staff, which only added to the negative feeling I was getting from this DUMP of a hotel. People sure have excellent customer service and relation skills in this travelodge, why I think I'll book some more nights....not. The room was another shock, peeling woodwork, tiny bathroom, the bath was not big enough to drown a mouse. Two beds, with paper thin duvets and one pillow? ONE PILLOW? And a tiny pathetic excuse for a heater in the corner. We FROZE, all night & every moment we were in the room. The cleaners came and cleaned the room while we were out the following day, and changed my friends bedding to STAINED bedding. Could NOT believe it. Couldn't even be bothered to complain because it was just a typical stinky dump, that should be shut down. How they get away with health and safety, I have no idea?!

They were far enough down the corridor that you couldn't hear the lift so it was generally pretty quiet apart from a little traffic noise and the odd person/people walking past the room. The rooms were clean, which is the main thing. I found the bed pretty comfortable. A trip to reception was needed for an extra pillow as we both wanted 2 but there was only the one spare in the very spacious wardrobe. The reception staff were fine and happy to hand over the extra pillow. The rooms weren't the warmest and the duvets were on the thin side so we asked for a blanket at reception also (after searching the wardrobe to no avail) but they said they didn't have any extra blankets. Slightly annoying but the chap was rather apologetic and actually I wasn't as cold as I expected to be during the night. There was a kettle, mugs and tea/coffee, but no hairdryer. The carpet looked and felt perfectly clean to me. The bathroom was small but adequate and most importantly clean, no mildew in sight! We booked on a room only basis and didn't bother trying the hotel breakfast as there were a number of cafes and a McDonalds on the way to the tube station - a 10 minute walk. Overall, this hotel was just fine for what we wanted. It's cheap and cheerful. We'd come to London to see London, museums and a show, not to spend time in our hotel so as a base to sleep, shower and change it was great.

After fighting our way through the drunk gang spitting and fighting at the door we were given our room key and told our room was on floor 5. The lifts were stinking (hate to think what of) and very rickety. The hall outside our room was filled with people milling around and smoking. Our room (a triple) had a broken bed, grimy linen, broken toilet and the wallpaper was handing off. I have never felt so unsafe in any place I have been too. We went downstairs to ask to be moved and were further alarmed to find ourselves met in reception my the hotels own \"bouncers\" who were breaking up a fight at the door. The receptionist could not give a monkeys about our complaint. We told him that it was illegal for smoking and that we felt unsafe and could he please phone alternative Travelodges for us to move. It was almost midnight and he said they were all full but if we \"wandered about the local streets\" we might find somewhere - to suggest this to a couple with a 10 year old child was just nonsense. He refused to phone, however eventually another staff member (the barman) said we could use the phone and try to get somewhere else to stay. By this time the Police had arrived to sort out the melee in reception. Eventually we got the night porter at the Kings Cross Travelodge hotel nearby who said he had rooms and told us to come round. Interestingly he said that he had himself called the Police on the Royal Scot several times as their guests had caused problems on numerous occasions. We have complained to Travelodge and, interesting, since we made our complaint they have changed their website and now state that this hotel is \"an acquisition\" and the rooms \"are not of the standard shown on the photos\".

It cost about \u00c2\u00a350 for a twin room. We were looking for a cheap room for one night and figured a Travel Lodge should be reliable. Also I had an ok on it from a friend who'd stayed here twice. All we were after was somewhere clean, basic, reasonable and safe enough for two women. After I booked it I read the reviews here and nearly booked somewhere else! Hence why I'm writing this. However I was pleasantly surprised and frankly relieved! The hotel is a typical 60s concrete building. Nothing particularly attractive about it. As a hotel that has been bought over by rather than purpose built for Travel Lodge it's not their standard offering. But the foyer is clean and modern with a cafe/restaurant/bar, internet access and snack machines too. There's an off-licence across the road for late night snacks and a selection of take-aways (the chippy across the road was fine). The area is perfectly ok to walk about in during the day. It might be preferable to get a taxi at night though, but that's pretty average advice for any part of city other than the very busiest central areas. Interior standard:- There are signs that this has been quite a nice hotel in it's day. Now it's rather worn around the edges though. The lifts for instance are brass inside but have been painted over with white paint making them rather scruffy. And the second floor landing woodwork etc looked like it had all been quite stylish in it's prime. As it was there was nothing really wrong with it, just worn. Room:- The room itself was fine (and really, I'm picky about cleanliness). The twin beds were made up with plain white cotton bedlinen and were spotless (I like to see plain white sheets as they can be hot-washed unlike fancier bedcovers). The furniture was a little worn but serviceable and nothing broken and the walls had each been emulsioned in slightly different peachy shades. Seems they'd used a different can for each wall (but at least they had been done). A TV, heater, kettle and the usual things all in order. Curtains clean and in good condition and blackout lined. The en-suite was small but clean with towels. The floor tiles looked pretty new. Noise: - We were there on a Thursday night so not the weekend which maybe helped. There was a bit of noise from pipes and a fire door in the corridor but you get that in hotels. Some morning noise from the delivery yard at the rear which we overlooked but that's par for the course too. I slept like a log and I'm a light sleeper. Staff:- Reception was fine, but then we had no cause to put them to the test. We didn't eat breakfast as \u00c2\u00a37.50 is only worth it if you want the full cooked shebang. As it was we just grabbed something at a cafe on the way to Kings Cross. Summary:- The only way I can reconcile my experience (and a few others on here) with the really bad reviews is that parts of this large hotel may have fallen into more disrepair than others. Perhaps day of the week, when you book etc make too large a difference to the standard of room you get? That I can't comment on. I can only say that the room we were in and the general standard of the public areas was perfectly ok for the price. I might have been displeased if I'd paid full rate but there are generally deals to be had for Travel Lodges. No, it isn't the Ritz!

The bed was good and the bathroom very large. Only one lift works (out of 3 lifts there) so be prepared to wait (as only 3 people fit in to it with luggage) or use the stairs, we found the stairs were a better option and we only used the lift for booking in and out. Luckily we were on floor 3 though so not too many stairs. We waited for 3pm check in (half an hour) so as not to get charged an extra 10 pounds on check in. Quite an odd idea if the rooms are already ready but that is how they do it. However the hotel is not as negative as some people make out, it is a10 min walk to Kings Cross/St Pancras, and it was a good budget option for us, gave us more to spend on tours and food.

First impressions of this hotel were not bad. All seemed fine on entering the large and modern-looking reception area, and the receptionist greeted us with a smile (not always forthcoming in London). Things went downhill when we headed up to our room in the angriest sounding lift I've ever heard. I almost expected it to say, \"FOURTH FLOOR, GET OUT\". The fourth floor was even less welcoming, with peeling paint and dirty carpets. So far, so bad. Of course, the worst thing about this hotel had to be our room. We had a family room with three tiny single beds crammed in. A light bulb out, a cigarette end in the drawer, graffiti on the desk and a broken panel under the sink, which had just been left there rather than fixed (although, it did seem a bit beyond fixing...). The inner window pane was jammed open, letting in the freezing cold and plenty of noise from outside. We did inform reception about this, and a workman dealt with it quickly.

The price was attractive but in hindsight I wish we'd paid that little extra and stayed at the Travelodge just up the road which is considerably better. Reasons for rating it 1 star as follows: 1. We arrived at 2.30pm and were advised that we could not check in until 3pm, unless we paid an extra \u00c2\u00a310. The unpleasant member of staff relaying this information actually laughed at us for wanting to check in for free. By 2.45pm, a crowd of 30+ guests had assembled in reception. Three members of staff waited patiently behind their desk, telling each guest in turn that they had to pay \u00c2\u00a310 or wait, which the staff continued to find amusing. 2. Only one lift (for 4 people) was working, the other two were out of order. However, no 'out of order' signs were displayed as there was apparently no intention to fix the other lifts. The crowd that had waited until 3pm to check in now had to wait again for the single lift. 3. The sheets on our bed were stained, in a very unpleasant way. The rest of the room was merely run down (scuffed furniture, mould in the window corners). On a positive note, the shower worked. 4. Only one towel was provided for a two-person booking. Staff would not deliver an extra towel to the room so I was obliged to return to reception. 5. The stair-case was dilapidated. Large amounts of plasterwork have fallen off the walls, and staff do not appear to clean the area (empty beer cans littering the window sills and floors, graffiti on the signs in the area, dust (presumably from the crumbling plasterwork) everywhere). Out-of-date signs provide incorrect directions (ignore the sign for 'breakfast room' directing you to explore the first floor, this is a red herring). 6. Noise levels were high throughout the night, both from drunken guests and from a group of kids yelling at one another in the car park to the rear of the premises. 7. Breakfast was a shambles. The restaurant could not cater for the amount of guests in the building, so we had to queue for a table. Once we had a table, we then had to wait another 10 minutes as they had run out of plates. The food which we eventually got hold of was awful. Other reviewers may take the view \"you get what you pay for\".

Although overlooking the main road outside it was remarkably quiet. Overall a very pleasant stay.

I went back to reception where I queued for at least ten minutes before someone assisted me, I handed the man the key and simply said i thought there had been a mistake as i booked a double and i'd been given a single. He snatched the key from me, put something into his computer and insisted that 'all rooms where the same' I then told him about my previous stay and requested the same if not a similar room. He told me i must be making it up as all the rooms in this hotel are apparently the 'same'. I explained about the chair, his solution was the following 'take a chair from reception up to your room if you need a chair so badly'. I then asked rather more sternly to change rooms to which I was told there were none clean, unless I was willing to pay another \u00c2\u00a310 early check in charge!

Anyway, after waiting for about 5-10mins, (not making much progress) I asked one of the other two staff if they could help check in people. After rolling his eyes at me, he then made some effort, and checked me (after 3 others) in, the whole procedure was rather cumbersome. The feel of the hotel is very worn out, dated, not well maintained at all, one does fear this looking from the outside at this building, and it gets firmly confirmed when you get into the lift, to go to you room. I am surprised these are actually still working, because they seem to have not been maintained since they were installed during the 60s. Then the room, it was ok, however, certainly not very clean, it just felt very worn out, in a shabby sort of way. Windows are old, so noise from traffic does come through, overall one does get to sleep eventually, only with the nice prospect of full English breakfast the next morning. Even when you come down early, breakfast is a complete and utter chaos, a free for all, very dis-organised, not at all what you expect. Firstly, you need to take the paper room card holder with you (doesn't always get told to you at check in) otherwise (like me) you have to go back to your room and get it, rather irritatingly. You get handed cuttlery, with a look that says, \"good luck trying to get anything fresh this morning, now move out of the way I need to push/squeeze as many in as possible.\" very nice treatment indeed. Now I am not very demanding in terms of breakfast, but a cup of coffee, toast, an egg, will do me, this was not possible, most of the breakfast seem to be permanently in empty dishes, and I had to ask 5 times for a cup of coffee. . . and eventually went to use an awful machine that spewed out something that has to represent coffee.

There were stains on the wall and the paintwork was all chipped and marked. We came back on the 1st night and ordered drinks in the bar. The bar maid could hardly be bothered to serve us and didnt say please or thank you. There were empty bottles and glasses left on the tables. We used the stairs most of the time as the lifts were not working properly. We stayed for 3 nights and paid \u00c2\u00a3280 so expected a bit more than we got. Very disappointing for a travelodge as we have stayed in them before and always been highly satisfied.

And our visit to the Royal Scot was for that sole purpose en route for a short break in Paris. The hotel was chosen due to its fantastic location close to St Pancras International (King's Cross Train/Tube Station is also the same distance) and also for its price, as at \u00c2\u00a359 was the cheapest in the area for a Saturday night. I'd like to go on record to say that everything was what you'd expect from a Travelodge - it looked clean and welcoming on arrival, the staff were friendly, first impression of the room was good and the food in the restaurant was nice and not too expensive. The ONLY problem, however, was a big one, in our (my fiancee and I) opinion anyway. It had been a very hot day in London and when the day's are hot, the night's are, too. The only form of air conditioning in the room was a 70's looking contraption attached to the wall which didn't even kick in when you first turned it on, and when it started to work only a spittle of air was coming out of it - it made no difference at all. And to make matters worse the window could only open about 10 centimetres meaning that it was like an oven in the room all night - it was unbearable and my fiancee even had to have a cold shower at 1am just to cool down. Looking out of our window at that time there seemed to be an awful lot of open curtains as, just like in our room, that was the only way that the small amount of air could enter between the curtains. As I said this was the only problem, but it didn't make our stay enjoyable.

On the occasions that the lift was too busy we used the stairs, the walls on the stairs were disgusting, they were dirty and in some places there was plaster falling off the walls. Once leaving the lift, walking down the corridor to our room the walls were in a bad state, they were also very dirty. Our room was just as bad, in fact I would go so far as to describe it as filthy. The wall heater had black smears and finger marks all over it The walls were dirty and had marks and stains all over them, there were also holes in the wall in places. The curtains were hanging off the rails There was a large crack in the frame of the television The mirror on the wall in the bedroom area was dirty and had something, goodness only knows what dripping down it. The bathroom door on the inside had varnish missing and looked old and worn. The sink tap was very dirty and looked like it had not been cleaned for some time, the same goes for the other fittings in the bathroom. The shower curtain rail was rusty. Around the tiled walls of the bath the grouting was covered in black mould/mildew, not just small amounts but big black patches. The toilet was absolutely vile, it was badly stained inside. There was a brown stain on the white duvet cover. There were only two pillows supplied. There was no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in the room to use. So we were woken in the morning by the maid wanting to service the room. There was what looked like an old wall heater on the wall that had been disconnected; the vents on the heater were quite visibly full of thick dust. When the room was cleaned the towels were not re folded and were just left hanging on the back of a chair where we had left them that morning. On the whole the hotel felt disgustingly dirty and was in serious need of some cleaning and maintenance. I have never seen anything quite so bad in any other hotel that I have stayed in.

I went to the Royal Scot Travelodge with my girlfriend so we could go and see Rage Against The Machine at Finsbury Park so we only needed to stay there for one night. The service was very good. We walked into the reception and got our room key at 1:30 and the staff member who served us was VERY polite, asked for details such as name and confirmed the room type. She also asked us how many keys we'd need. After checking in, we used the lift to get up to the room and walked along the corridor to the room. The bed was made, had clean white sheets as well as pillows, tea and coffee facilities, an extra pillow, towels, soap, drinking cups, a colour TV with digital free-view channels and a couple of sockets for phone chargers. We made ourselves comfortable for a few hours and then left the room to go to the festival. We go back later on that night at about 11pm. The doors for reception were open, the bar was still serving drinks and people were checking in. We collected a few teabags, sugars and milks from reception to take back to the room because there's only enough to make 2 teas/coffees with the facilities provided.

We left the windows open because the rooms were rather warm because of the heat outside but still, there was no noise to be heard and we got a pleasant nights sleep on the bed which was extremely comfortable. Better than my bed at home! The next morning, we woke up, showered and wend downstairs for breakfast which we hadn't pre-booked as we didn't think we'd be up for it. The restaurant offered an all you can eat breakfast. It included full English breakfast, cereal, toast with spreads, croissants, hot drinks, yoghurts and orange juice. The could be more that I forgot. The area was clean and tidy and staff were excellent. After, we headed back to our room to have a nap until 11:45am and then we checked out by putting our cards in the slot on reception. We then left. The main reason we chose this hotel over others is because it's a budget hotel, we only needed to stay one night and that the tube station and overground station are just a 10 minute walk away.

The room was by far the best part of the hotel. The sheets were spotless, the bed comfortable, the shower and bathroom very good and clean and the room itself in very nice condition. A TV, tea, coffee milk and kettle were all available and led to a very comfy stay. In the caf\u00c3\u00a9 I enjoyed some tomato soup and a roll, which was a fairly small portion but nonetheless very nice in the quiet restaraunt area. There were two problems with the hotel. The groups of foreign students, as mentioned before, were running and shouting along the corridoors, and knocking on each other's doors until well after 11pm. I'm not sure why this hotel attracts so many, but there really should be rules in place to prevent the noise late at night. I did however manage to get a fine sleep. Secondly the only way to get up into the rooms is via 3 fairly old lifts which can become crowded, there are no available stairs to get to the upper floors.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the rooms are pretty small and utilitarian, and quite in need of a makeover. The curtain in my room was missing a couple of hooks, but it was no big deal.

As you can tell, if I'm prepared to stay in it more than once, then it's obviously bearable. Sadly, some of the other reviews on here do paint an accurate picture of what it's really like. This particular hotel is an acquisition hotel; that is a hotel bought over by Travelodge and now operating as a Travelodge. Consequently, you don't really get that much Travelodge branding and the rooms aren't really in keeping with the Travelodge room style. Sadly, this particular hotel does tarnish the Travelodge reputation somewhat. Most of the rooms are kitted out in the design of the previous hotel's incarnation. Solid wood furniture, baths in the bathroom (uncommon in most Travelodges) and, rather unfortunately, no air conditioning. Having stayed here during the summer months and the hottest of temperatures outside, the heat in the hotel can be unbearable and it's worth remembering this if you decide to book to stay during the summer months. As other reviews have pointed out, the hotel can be noisy. It appears to be popular with group excursions so you tend to get a lot of groups mingling around. Depending on the location of your room, you may find that you get lumbered with a bed next to a door that fronts onto a busy corridor. Another downfall of this hotel is the lack of chairs in the rooms. The modern Travelodge room layout always encompasses a chair as anyone who's stayed in the Kings Cross, City Road or Euston Travelodges can testify. If you want to do some work at a desk in the evening, apply your make up sat in front of a mirror or just relax in a chair, you could be disappointed. The staff on reception will, however, allow you to take a chair from the bar for your room but you can look silly taking it all the way upstairs or via the lift. The hotel does have its plus points. I've rarely paid more than \u00c2\u00a330 a night to stay here and, to be honest, I'd begrudge paying anything more than this. It has a convenient location about 10 minutes from Kings Cross St Pancras station and on a relatively quiet road. Unlike other Travelodges, this one has lockers for left luggage and you can store your luggage here for something like \u00c2\u00a35 (slightly cheaper than the facility at the nearby station). If you're after a convenient and cheap hotel that has no frills but is largely clean then I'd say plump for this particular one. If you're a light sleeper, just ensure you're comfortable with your allocated room before you settle into it. Finally, if you do see another Travelodge cheaper elsewhere, plump for it!

She lied, she accused me of lying, she was obnoxious and completely incapable of working in a hotel reception. No people skills and quite clearly no ability to deal with a genuine complaint. In our brief time at the hotel I hoverheard 4 seperate people making complaints about the facilities. We had booked 3 double rooms for a family break, as we were travelling seperately the others in the party arrived before my partner and I and had booked in. When we arrived we were told by the 'receptionist' that they did not have any double rooms left and that we would be in a tripple, she said that if we came down before 12pm the follwing day we could change our room to a double, we reluctantly accepted this, and made our way to the tripple room. The room was not what we would have expected from a travelodge (see photos). The bathroom was dirty and had dirty towels that had not been removed, there was a hole in the bathrooms door, the grout around the bath and sink was grubby, there was dry rot in the skirting and a disgusting brown build up of something unidentified around the join between the toilet and tiles, we had no soap, the plastic disposable cups had clearly been used by the guests before us (toothpaste stains etc) The dressing table/desk had no chair, there were what looked like brown liquid stains all over the walls from top to bottom (god knows what happened in that room?!?!) there were what looked like either vomit or hot chocolate stains down the side of the tv unit and finaly there was mould around the window. DISGUSTING. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. THE PHOTOS POSTED BY OTHER REVIEWERS ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL THE ROOMS IN THE HOTEL. ONLY SOME OF THE FLOORS HAVE RENOVATED ROOMS. As suggested the night before we went to reception to ask for our room to be changed, The receptionsist (a different one) said that this was fine and told us to pack our bags in preparation for the move. We were told to come back in the afternoon and our double room would be ready. When we returned the original rude receptionist was back on duty- to cut a very long story short - our double room was not available, she denied that the person we spoke to in the morning even existed, then when countered about it she said the woman didn't work there!!!! She denied that she had told us when we checked in that we could swap rooms, and basically accused me of lying and making it all up. The hotel was overbooked so our option was to stay in the room we had or to find another hotel. It appeared to be ok for the hotel to give someone else the double room we had booked and paid for before arrival but she refised point blank to give us a double room that someone else had not yet booked into even although it meant splitting up a party of 6 . In the end two of us had to move to another hotel. She arranged for us to be picked up by taxi and moved to another travelodge. As it turned out the taxi was unmarked and the driver dropped us off 10mins away from the travelodge. We had no idea where we were going and had to hail a black cab to take us there. When we got to the second hotel they had no record of us being moved! We had to wait an hour before the deputy manager was able to give us a room. He had to sort out the mess. I am not fussy, I expect a room of the standard that is being paid for, we paid \u00c2\u00a359 per night (room only), cheap by London standards.

The room was a little grubby in parts and could do with some updating but no worse that any other travelodge or city hotel that I stayed in. One point I should mention is that I found the room to be incrediably hot and the heating gauge that was in the room was too complicated to work. Towels and linen were very clean and I have no complaints about the staff, who although direct were polite and helpful whenever encountered. The location of the hotel is also good, around 5 minutes walk from Kings Cross station.

We booked 2 nights (sat/sun) and paid on only \u00c2\u00a387 between two of us which for central London i thought was very reasonable although breakfast wasnt included we did have breakfast in the hotel in Sunday (\u00c2\u00a37.50) which was adequate and seen us through to lunch. Secondly - Location We booked this hotel in the first instance because of its location, closeness to the tube and local buses into central london, This hotel is litterally 5-10 minutes walk from Kings Cross / St Pancras Int, and there buses into central London from outside Kings Cross every 2-3 minutes during the day and many night buses also serve the area so public transport access is excellent 24/7, The hotel is also with walking distannce of central London we walked to Tottenham Court Road in around 45-50 minutes. Third - The Hotel Generally The hotel I though was excellent although the only negative point is that some areas could do with a lick of paint, but otherwise everything was brilliant. As a previous review has stated this hotel is used by quite alot of tours so some times the reception / bar area can feel crowded but generally this is sorted as quickly as possible. The staff were all extremely helpful and couldnt do enough to ensure we had a pleasant stay, The hotel also has a strict no smoking policy (in line with the ban on smoking in public places) and this is rigurously enforced by staff with a fine of \u00c2\u00a3150 for anyone caught smoking in their room. The room we booked was described as twin and was adequate although the bathroom was tad on the small side but we were only using the place as a base and somewhere to sleep. The hotel bar is open from 5pm till 1am daily food served till 10pm and for central London was quite reasonbly priced, although there are many bars and fast food outlets around the hotel. All things considered I would definatley recomend this hotel to anyone looking for a central London base for their stay in the capital. Two Top Tips 1) book as early as possible to get the best deals our stay was \u00c2\u00a355 for the Sat night and only \u00c2\u00a332 for the Sun night so bargains are there to be had. 2) if your travelling round London, consider getting an Oyster card from Transport for London which gives discounted tube travel, or simply get a travel card as these can be considerably cheaper than paying for seperate journeys (cash fare between two zone 1 stations cost \u00c2\u00a34.00 single, but only \u00c2\u00a31.60 with an oyster card, and a zone 1-2 travel card cost \u00c2\u00a37.20 making oyster cards or travel cards much cheaper for multiplr trips in anyone day.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cNot what you would expect from travelodge\u201d", "Author": "pinkslippers", "ReviewID": "UR34060675", "Content": "Have used Travelodge many times before but this one the worst.Reception staff friendly and reception area clean enough, the room though needed an overhaul, bathroom terrible, mould in the bathroom & not really as clean as it should have been, a broken bed. room previously used by a smoker although it was non smoking- the smell remained. - dismal room really.

We asked for a quiet room so were given one facing the back street. It was noisy but with the windows closed it was ok to sleep, just with no air con it was very, very hot! The bed seemed comfortable and pillows ok. Ensuite you could barely stand in they are so tiny. Shower was ok and powerful enough. We had to be up at 6 so we tried to have an early night and were suprised that the hotel seemed quiet at 11 at night.....we thought we were going to be lucky. But no, come midnight the loud party-goers returned to the hotel (bearing in mind we stayed on a Tuesday night we were not expecting much loud behaviour!). Instead of returning quietly and going to their rooms, they were talking loudly, and shouting down the hallways and slamming their doors. This continued as each room returned until gone 3 in the morning - that was 3 hours lost sleep. The walls to the room seem paper-thin also. I could hear people talking in their rooms who were two rooms away! I could also hear the people in the next room (who seemed to be quiet and like us trying to get rest) use the toilet.... lovely! We finally got some sleep and were woken up at 5.30 with the first person leaving - and slamming their doors (probably in protest of the inconsidereate people who returned late and made as much noise as they could). The location is fine, 5-10 mins walk from Kings Cross - though the street is absolutely fine in the day - not sure I would want to walk it in the dark evenings in winter....

My room faced over the back of the hotel which overlooked other guest rooms. There are no privacy curtains so you have to hide in your room to get changed or get dressed in the dark (you could of course turn the lights on and shut the curtains but pretty sad on a bright sunny day!) The room was clean and tidy and a good size, however the bed was shocking!!! It was so soft, it felt like it collapsed beneath me when I sat down, and I'm only 9st! Not a very good night's sleep.

But the public parts of the hotel were what disappointed - inadequate lifts in shabby condition (with 2 out of the 3 out of order during most of our stay); a cold lobby totally inadequate for the number of people who gathered there - it was often jammed with queues from coach parties. (The automatic doors to the street seemed to jam on Open.) Totally inadequate breakfast accommodation, which was caused long queues to form in the cold lobby, and caused you to have to search for empty chairs and carry them to your table. Be warned - this is not the right hotel if you are looking for a restful haven from the hustle of a weekend in London, or a place to get a bit of work done between appointments. A large part of the clientele was made of coach parties of noisy - though not in our experience rowdy - crowds of teenagers.

It's not the prettiest hotel to look at - it's a converted office block and it shows. And the reception area hasn't done much to hide that either. It looks every inch the office security front desk. The bar/restaurant is located just to the side of the reception, and looks a bit worse for wear and slightly unloved. The chairs are a bit old and the tables slightly worn. It resembles something direct from a working mens social club (think Peter Kay's Pheonix Nights). The lifts are a bit of a squeeze. You'll fit a couple of people with a medium suitcase each, but probably no more. The corridors are never ending. Walking along them feels like walking along a cruise ship. The corridors seem to stretch for miles, the walls adorned with heavy wooden doors, and the floor covered with thick, but wearing carpet. And speaking of doors, your first challenge is learning how to close the door quietly. It can't be done. The doors slam behind you, even with the most careful shutting, which can be a nuisance when your neighbours roll in at an ungodly hour of the night. Our TV reception was a bit rubbish on some channels and the toilet didn't flush very well - you needed to pump it rather than flush it to clear the toilet paper from the bowl. But, for all of this, the hotel has some pretty postive plus points. The rooms are clean and the beds are incredibly soft and comfortable. The hotel is fabulously located for a weekend in the capital, being close enough to KC to have the city at your feet, but far enough away not to feel totally bombarded. And if you're looking for value for money, you can't get much better. We got two nights less than a month before Christmas for \u00c2\u00a364 the lot.

The first room we were given was supposed to have been one of the better ones, with a \"view\" of the main road. The hotel is supposedly strict on not smoking in the rooms but it stank of smoke even thought the window was left ajar. Unfortunately, the window was stuck in that position too, and the road noise came in. The air con was noisy. We resigned ourselves to our room until we realized that it wouldn't lock when we closed it from the outside. We complained to the reception about the faulty lock and were told that we should just slam the door a bit harder! That usually took more than one attempt to make sure the door locked. After doing this a couple of times, we almost came to blows with a burly guest from a neighbouring room who (understandably) was upset at the noise. Intimidated, my husband (5' 5\" and not at all muscular) went to the reception and explained that we just HAD to get another room. Thankfully, they had one available, although it only had two single beds. Our new room had other drawbacks: a \"beautiful\" view of the parking lot and dumpster, a tiny bathroom, and an air con that did not work (a problem as London was experiencing hot weather during our visit). Next, we discovered that the safe could not be used. According to the receptionist, the safes have either been disconnected or removed from the rooms! Although we put up \"do not disturb\" signs, housekeeping entered the room. And don't bother to try and be environment-friendly by hanging your towels on the towel rails, because they'll change them anyway.

The decoration in the rooms is really shabby and the corridors look old and tired and get really messy.

We arrived early and were checked in no problem. It took a little longer than usual, as a new employee was learning, but this caused no problem to us. We were advised of where the room would be and the procedure for breakfast, and off we went to Level 2. Our room was quite a way, right at the end of the corridor (Room 231), but we found it was a corner room with two large windows overlooking a quiet cresent and green area. The room was of good, large size. There was a large wardrobe with hangers, dresser, television (no cable channels), and a large bed. The bathroom was very small, but very clean and polished. The shower curtain was in tact and the power shower was indeed powerful, and hot at all times of day. The towels were clean and changed each morning. Only downsize was there was no toiletries other than a soap. The bed was large and we found it very comfortable. The sheets were immaculately clean, and changed while we were out. We also had two bed side cabinets with lamps, which was adequate for evening lighting, when the main light wasn't necessary. The only down side to our room was that a few corners of wall paper was peeling slightly, and the curtains were coming away from the curtain pole, which did allow some street light in. Although not a major issue, it did let it down a little for us. The hotel was used by a mixture of tourists and a lot of foreign school / college parties, who I belive to be a mixture of Spanish, Italian and French, so at times reception was busy. We experienced no noise in our room though. We also found the groups had eaten breakfast and were out the hotel before 9am, so to be honest, we rarely saw them. Breakfast was adequate, with ample seating. However it is self service and the service bar area was far to small for the number of people trying to get food. There was; tea / coffee / juice, toast, yoghurt, cereal, and hot food including sausage (I found this very grizzly sausage and not nice), bacon, scrambled egg, beans, mushrooms and tomatoes. The food was hot and fresh, but ran down very quickly due to the number of people eating. The nearest Tube was Kings Cross St Pancrease station, which was only a ten minute walk away, so we found this very convinient to access the system and travel quickly around London. The Tube was very well sign posted and easy to navigate. The hotel did not keep any left luggage due to security (understandable), but there is a secure left luggage facility at Kings Cross Train Station which was ideal, as we had to check out at 11 am and our return train wasn't until 6.30 pm that evening. We also found there to be lots of cafes, shops and resturants around the hotel to grab a snack or meal. Although the area is a little run down, we felt safe at all times and had no problems at all. Overall, I'd stay here again if I was able to secure the 'Saver' rates, but feel the \u00c2\u00a380.00 + they charge per night at full rate is a little steep.

I could hear the people in the next room using the loo as I laid in bed trying to sleep!! We slept better on the second night thanks to being so tired only to be woken early by housekeeping knocking on the door even though we put the appropriate sign on the door asking not to be disturbed. On the third morning we were hoping for a bit of a lie in before we went for our train only to be evacuated for a fire alarm about 8am. We were left to stand outside without any commumication from staff. The Hotel room was small - this I accept. The bathroom was miniscule and impracticle. It was acceptably clean. The hotel seemed to have a lot of international teenager/student groups staying. I believe this led to some of the problems we had i.e noise on the corridors and false fire alarms. If a hotel is used mainly by couples and families these issues may not have arisen. In summary I wont be using Travelodge again and will spend a bit more to get a better night sleep.

Bedrooms were absolutely fine - 3 single beds, fresh white bed linen ( duvets not blankets) and warm and cosy. Good bathroom, good shower,plenty of towels - No free toiletries - but this was \u00c2\u00a319 per room between 3 of us! Plenty of free tea & coffee though! Children were tired so we didn't want to eat out (or even in the hotels own restaurant) so took a quick walk back to the shops around Kings X. Bought various takeaway foods -Pizza, Fish n Chips, Subway sandwiches, Starbucks etc and took them back to the hotel.....management didn't bat an eyelid....perfectly happy for us to take the food back to the rooms! A refreshing change. Next morning breakfast was very chaotic....plenty of choice, but very very busy so had to queue for a table, but there was no pressure on you to eat up and go...the staff just quickly and efficiently cleared tables away to allow others in. Highly recommended - perfect for a clean, comfortable, no frills break in a very convenient location.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wirral, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOh stop moaning, you're in London!\u201d", "Author": "SeanandLinda", "ReviewID": "UR12503269", "Content": "I've used this hotel twice now. I love London, and therefore I have little need for a luxurious hotel room over looking the Thames or the Queen's backgarden. I need a place to sleep for 9 hours and then leave for the day. And this place is perfect. It's literally a 4 minute walk to the best tube station in London. There must be at least 6 different Underground lines that go from King's Cross St Pancras. There are also a few bus stops around the hotel but we didn't find that we needed them in the end, the tube was perfect. The room is fine. It's got all the basics (like tea making facilities) and an iron, hairdryer and extra pillows can be requested from reception. The bathroom is small but perfectly usable. Soap and shampoo is provided. It kind of felt halfway between clean and unclean but it was still good for a budget hotel. I don't think they vacuum under the beds too often though: I found the lid off something from a previous customer which I would have guessed would have been found by the cleaners normally! Beware that this is a big budget hotel, and I mean big. If you get a room on the opposite end of the building to the reception, expect a good 5 minute walk from the lifts to the room! Please don't use the hotel resturant, day or night. We went there on our first night and besides the fact that half the menu wasn't avaliable, it all tasted like it was cooked straight from frozen. And it was pretty moderately priced so I would have expected a lot more. Go into the city for dinner or go to the Chinese across the road from King's Cross main station. Cheap prices, huge portions; but the most bizarre waitress service ever! Stay away at breakfast! \u00c2\u00a38 for more straight-off-the-lorry food in their depressing continental breakfast. Actually, as a Brit, I was quite insulted to look around the room and see all these poor foreigners eating this rip-off tripe. It certainly did not give a good impression of British food or the UK. But anyway, my rating is for the hotel and it's sleeping facilities, not add-on extras like the resturant. I had little contact with the staff there but they were nice and could take a joke! And the cleaning staff always say \"Good morning\" if you pass them in the corridors.

We checked in and were directed to our room which was on the 2nd floor. We took the very slow, smelly and rickety lift up to the 3nd floor and set off down a long corridor. When we found our room, we were surprised to find we were back at street level. The road next to the hotel is on a slope so we were on what was really the ground floor of the back part of the building. Bit unsettling to have people walking past your bedroom window, peering in as they do so but we weren't planning to spend much time in the room so we could cope with this. The room was surprisingly tatty. I've stayed in lots of Travelodges and they are usually boring but comfortable...you know the kind of thing....matching curtains, bedspreads and cushions and boring paintings on the wall but generally clean and modern. This room was very mismatched with old tatty furniture and shabby curtains. It didn't seem very clean, but this could have just been that the furnishings and curtains etc were so old. The bathroom was the biggest shock though...a tiny, poorly lit room with no window, a smell of drains and very dirty, mouldy shower curtain. The shower badly needed replacing and barely trickled. The grouting around the tiles was black and above the sink, the mirror had been yanked off the wall leaving a huge rectangle of exposed cement. I hated going in the bathroom and would just race to get showered so I could get out of there again! There were a lot of large groups of European school kids there when we stayed and they all seemed to have free reign to run up and down the corridors screaming and banging all day and night which was annoying. I suppose in such a huge hotel you are always going to get some annoying guests but it would be good if the management tried to clamp down on behaviour which ruins everyone elses stay.

Although I was with my boyfriend, I don't think I would have been too worried on my own either. It's well lit and there always seemed to be people around, even late at night.

I must admit I was quite worried bringing my daughter to this hotel after reading the reviews, she is a very young 18 year old and was already fretting over going on the tube (her fear was because of the previous terror attacks) and I wanted her first visit to London and the theatre to be a memorable experience for the right reasons. We were given a room in the millenium block and it was awful, it was on ground level with a view of the side street where anyone can look in, I closed the curtains and kept them shut. Wallpaper was peeling off, it was dull and could do with brightening up, we hated it but decided to make the most of it as we were only sleeping there for one night and would be out for most of the time. We returned from the theatre by tube and the walk to the hotel was not pleasant there were a few drunks along the way and a few dodgy looking people which scared us both and made us feel very vulnarable but we just linked arms and walked a little faster when we arrived back to the hotel a note had been put under the door saying we were being moved to another room due to maintance problems so at 11.00pm we got our things and went to reception where we were given another room and complimentary breakfast in the morning. Our new room was on the 6th floor and I must admit it was a room that I would expect from a travel lodge and 100% better than our orignal room. We enjoyed our stay there but only because of the room change, the complementary breakfast was not the best breakfast and I certainly would not have paid \u00c2\u00a37.50 for it.

The hotel is situated on 100 King\u00c2\u00b4s Cross Road, about 8 min walk to King\u00c2\u00b4s Cross St. Pancras tube station with excellent connection to most parts of London. The King\u00c2\u00b4s Cross area is not very interesting, but not bad either. There were pubs, cornerhops and chippys close to the hotel. At King\u00c2\u00b4s Cross station there is a large supermarket (Tesco, Caledonian Road), many places to eat, ATM\u00c2\u00b4s, etc. Check-in was fast and friendly. I booked all the nights seperately, but it was no problem to have the same room for the whole stay (I phoned before). We were given a room in the Millenium Section. It was more or less a ground floor room overlooking Vernon Rise, a relatively quiet street. During the whole, we didn\u00c2\u00b4t have any problems with noise, neither from the street nor from other guests. The room was bright and friendly, average-sized. It had a comfortable double bed (1.40 m), two bedside tables, bedside lamps, a desk with colour TV (5 TV channels, 4 Radio channels, remote control didn\u00c2\u00b4t work), and tea/coffee facilites. There was a lot of storage space in the room. The furniture was a bit older, but of a very good standard. The bathroom was quite small, it had a bathtub. I liked the large mirror that was plenty of room to put my things. There were enough towels, big and cosy and a heated tower rail. A bar of soap was provided, but nothing else. Bathroom was also a bit older, a few cracks in the tilings, but everything alright in general. A downside of the bathroom: the room was windowless and there was no ventilation, so you had to open the door while taking a shower. The room was cleaned everyday and coffee/tea and fresh towels were provided. Overall, this hotel was just perfect for our trip to London. To me, the standard of the room was comparable with 3-4 star hotels in London. It would say that that even the walk-in rate (71 pounds) would be a fair deal for London.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "worcester", "Title": "\u201cvlaue\u201d", "Author": "bmills", "ReviewID": "UR7723140", "Content": "Travelodges are basic, but the room was clean and towels fresh.

If you are just looking for a clean room with a bed and a working shower, this is exactly what you'll get and nothing more. I stayed there from May 24th - 29th 2007. I hope this review will be helpful to those wishing to have a great experience in London. Being a female travelling with her father, I wanted to know beforehand what to expect and was quite hesitant and scared about the reviews I had read. To make it quite clear, I did not know that most of the reviews I had read were for the Kings Cross location. For your information, the Royal Scot Travelodge may be different from the Kings Cross Travelodge which is situated close to the train station and this is not the Farringdon location. All 3 Travelodges are within close proximity and may all be known as Kings Cross Travelodges. This review is only for the Royal Scot site. I stayed in room 260 that overlooked the back of the hotel and as other reviews have already stated, there was usually a delivery truck that arrived around 7am to drop off/pick up towels. The noise normally lasted for about 1/2 hour. To be expected in a big city and really it was not such a bother as I was usually up by then getting ready. If you leave your window open you may hear voices from people down below but this didn't really bother me. As I was already warned that the area of Kings Cross can be dangerous and sketchy, I did expect and did in reality hear a bit of noise at night. As well, the doors to the rooms bang quite loudly so be expected to hear the slamming from time to time. The tv did not work that well but then again I wasn't there to watch tv. Although I did recieve the channels, the picture was fuzzy. It was just nice to have some tv on at night while reading my travel guides. The air conditioner was not working and for the first day, I simply asked the reception desk for a portable fan for the night , as it was quite warm. They also have hair dryers and irons for lending if needed as the rooms do not have these amenities. Simply inquire at the front desk. The room is small but please remember, this is not the Ritz and I did not pay for something like that and I got exactly what I wanted. The staff were very nice and I did not have any problems checking in, however, the hotel can get busy so be patient when waiting. Part of my travel package were breakfast vouchers for the duration of my stay and this was a great deal. A buffet style breakfast with scrambled eggs, beans and tomatoes, fruit, yogurt, toast, and cereal to choose from. I couldn't complain there. If you are booking through an agent, see if you can get this deal as well. There are phones in the rooms, however, they only work if you have a credit card or an accepted phone card. If you don't have either, there is a pay phone just outside the hotel. Overall my experience and stay at this hotel was great. I would definitely stay there again. My experience in London and at the hotel was further tested when I lost my purse on my cab ride back to the hotel on my second to last day in the city. I had my digital camera and cellphone in my purse along side my plane trip confirmation numbers but everything ended up well when my cabbie brought my purse and all it's contents back to the hotel and the staff informed me that it had been returned. This is really not a bad hotel for the price that you pay. The location is close to both Kings Cross Train station (when leaving the train station coming from Gatwick Airport, just make a right and go all the way down on the left hand side - about 6 minutes walk) to reach the hotel and the Kings Cross Tube station. This may be a long review but I wanted to give everyone looking for a good place to consider.", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cHorror Show\u201d", "Author": "Dave33Birmingham", "ReviewID": "UR7587493", "Content": "Last time I went to London, I stayed at the Farringdon Travelodge which is about 1/4 mile up the road from the Kings Cross Royal Scot Travelodge. As Royal Scot Travelodge is closer to King Cross Tube Station, I booked it for a 2 night stay. I think it's fair to say I made an error in judgement. At check-in, we were given room 2016 in the 'Millennium Rooms' section of the hotel. The name suggested modernity and grandeur but as this was a Travelodge, I didn't have any expectations beyond something at least half-decent. The room was quite a trek from the reception desk and we joked that it was probably quicker to walk to the Farringdon branch. The distance through the labyrinthine corridors and down an eerie stairwell felt like the 1/4 mile we thought we'd save to our tired legs by coming to this hotel. Worse was to come when we went into the room which overlooked a sort of car park/courtyard (but more about that later). First, a description of the room: I say 'room' but it felt more like a tomb. An airless, smelly, oppressive cave deep beneath a mountain of concrete. Worse was to come the first time I went into the bathroom. All the oxygen seemed to have been sucked out of the air and replaced by an unpleasant odour. I lifted the toilet lid and it looked clean enough, in fact it was gleaming white. But a closer look revealed something brown lurking at the bottom, just out of reach of a toilet brush. This was going to be weird. After a terrific and exhausting night out, we made our way back to the hotel anticipating a restful night's sleep and lots of wandering round London the next day. Unfortunately, we were woken by an almighty noise outside our window at about 7.00am. Our room overlooked a car park/delivery area and a lorry came to make an early-morning delivery. This lasted for 1/2 hour or so and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get back to sleep. On our way out later that morning, we mentioned it to the receptionist who looked bemused for a moment before assuring us it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen the next day. But it did. Same time, same almighty noise. My girlfriend went and complained while I tried and failed to get back to sleep. She returned, shortly after, having been compensated by the receptionist with 2 breakfast vouchers. I use the term 'breakfast' but it was an assortment of charred, greasy, lumpy bits of stuff. The croissants were stale, the juice sour, the water had a strange, unidentifiable metallic taste. It was supposed to be free, but I paid quite a high price with the indigestion that followed. There's a certain grim fascination to be found in places like this but it isn't for the faint of heart (or nose) (or ears). The sheer wrongness of the place compelled me to stay for the entire 2 nights to see how much worse it could get. I at least would have a bizarre tale to tell my friends in the pub: 'You wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe the place I stayed in!'", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value at \u00c2\u00a315!\u201d", "Author": "marcuschap72", "ReviewID": "UR7390426", "Content": "We booked in the easter sale for \u00c2\u00a315 so a shed in central london would be good!

If I was a single woman then maybe it might have been different. A tower block estate surrounds the hotel so a lot of locals live here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which might not be what a lot of people like. There are a lot of fast food places around which stay open to late and quiet a-few pubs and local shops so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to go hungry or thirsty. Check in took all of 3 minutes, 2 hours before they said you could do. As most Travel lodges do it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a key card system that lets you in and out of rooms and past reception. 3 lifts can take you to your room. The room was a basic Travelodge room. Look on there website for the specification its pretty much spot on. The room was clean, new towels daily as well as coffee and tea. If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being picky the only faults with the room was the TV pay feature wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available and the bathroom needed a good paintjob (it was showing its age). Having said that the TV worked fine, and the bathroom was clean and everything was working fine inside it. This was the cheapest I have ever paid for a hotel room in London. We paid \u00c2\u00a326 a night which is fantastic. Make sure you book through there website for the best prices. Please remember you get what you pay for normally in regards to hotels. My marking of this hotel reflects that. Next time I come to London I would be looking to stay in a Travelodge. Had a lot of bad surprises in other hotels and these (travelodge) seem to always be of the same high standard. The only factor I would consider is cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if I could get a cheaper Travelodge at a better location I would stay there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this travelodge is hard to fault.", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for central London\u201d", "Author": "BarnsleyChop", "ReviewID": "UR6473782", "Content": "Ignore the other two reviews about this being a dangerous place, some people are scared of their own shadow..

Some beds are comfy, some you would think would be more suited to being hammock rather than bed by definition. My room in the last night anyone can possibly make me stay in that hotel was infested with bed bugs. The staff made an error with the rooms and my single room was finally found after a long \"look around\" for it. I woke up the next day face and ears all over my body to my toes covered in bed bug bites (confirmed by pharmacist, doctor and apologetic travelodge staff). Travelodge staff told me I'd been given a room which was not meant to be used due to the infestion and it was a terrible mistake. I was told they minimise disturbance - i.e. cut costs - by only employing pest control every 3 months. They refunded 60 GBP and 7 GBP for antihistamines and I'm still waiting for a call 6 weeks later from the manager to apologise for their mistake, having given the duty manager all my contact details and was promised a call, and was told that they're very common in the UK and she had heard of a lot of cases since she had come to England working in Travelodge. Having done some reading on bed bugs, they actually migrate to surrounding rooms if they do not feed after a few months, so I would suggest that maybe the frequent number of cases is simply that the bed bugs are migrating to other rooms since the rooms are only treated every 3 months. For me apart from being unsightly, the itching was unbearable and that evening some of them turned into blisters - though the bites were already pretty horrendous as each bite was a red area around 3cm squared and swollen, hard and white in the centre. I went to a doctor and was given stronger antihistamines and steroid cream and no more turned into blisters. They finally calmed down after around 7 days during which I was too itchy and sleep deprived to work (the psychotic effects of literally being eaten alive are severe). 6 weeks later the red patches where the bugs bit are still there and people have asked if it is ecsema - and it's not from itching - I avoided the massive urge to itch, and even the bites that I could not reach to itch if i had itched look the same. To summarise, I would avoid this hotel at all costs, the staff were not very helpful or cooperative - when they messed up the booking tried to accuse the company of not booking enough rooms. they lost 30 packed lunches between 6 and 7am, which turned up that afternoon - because the reception staff on the morning shift did not speak english. Many of the rooms are shoddy, the service in the restaurant is abysmal (2 hours for quiet lunchtime for a party of 15)...

We had booked at the 26 pound per night rate that can be found on the Travelodge website. The regular rates through their website range from 60-70 pounds. The 26 pound rate is outstanding value for the room and amenities, as well as location of this hotel, and it would be hard to find a better room for the regular rates. We had rooms 203 and 206 for our two stays. Both had an ensuite bathroom with a tub-shower unit, twin beds, a TV with basic channels and with the option to purchase further channels (which we did not do). There is a phone that requires a credit card swipe for use--we did not use the phone as we had a mobile phone. The beds are covered with duvets, and the duvet covers as well as the bedsheets are changed daily. There were extra pillows in the cupboard. We received a large bath towel each as well as a smaller towel. As is typical in British hotels, there were no washcloths. Room 206 overlooked the inner courtyard, which contains parking spaces. Though we had the window open, we found the room to be incredibly quiet as was the hotel generally. Room 203 overlooked Vernon Rise (or Road, I so not remember). There was a double window, and with the windows shut there was no street noise. Vernon Rise has almost no traffic. We could see King's Cross Road and Penton Rise from our window, but could not hear the traffic. The hotel is a purpose built structure of 1960s or so architecture. The lobby of the hotel is new and comfortable and is attached to the bar/restaurant. There was no smoking in the looby or the restaurant, though people smoked on the stoop outside. Check-in was quick and easy on both occasions. We arrived an hour ahead of the check-in time on our first stay but received a room right away. There is no baggage check in the hotel, so it is wise to double-check room availability if you intend to arrive early. Otherwise, King's Cross Station offers baggage check. We tried the bar, which was pleasant enough, and the restaurant menu looked reasonable--one could eat a simple meal there, but there are pubs and restaurants nearby that look good too. Once through the lobby, we found our rooms by taking one of three elevators. The elevators are small and we could not figure out how to use the stairs to get to the lobby, so there was the odd delay in getting off our floor at busy times. The elevators work fine but are a bit scratched up. The second floor hallways look a bit worn but look quite decent all in all. The rooms were clean and reasonably maintained. Some of the woodwork was scratched and in places the wallpaper was loose. The bathrooms were clean, though could have used a more thorough dusting. There was a touch of mildew in one of the tubs, but the other was spotless. There was a large heating and cooling unit on the wall, which we did not use. The hotel is an easy ten minute walk from King's Cross rail station. We walked down Pentonville Road to King's Cross Road, which we followe right to the hotel. We also exited King's Cross Tube station through the Thames Link station (just follow the signs for Thames Link), which exits right on King's Cross Road making the walk a bit easier. We also accessed the hotel from one of the bus stops on Pentonville Road (second stop from King's Cross station), and went down Weston street--a mere 3 minutes or so to the hotel. Alternatively, the hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Angel tube down beautiful leafy streets. A number of buses pass close to the hotel, and the 63 goes right by. The area in general felt very safe. The street in front of the hotel is busy-ish, but behind are nice residential streets that receive almost no traffic. The park in Percy Circus right behind the hotel is quite lovely. Overall, for the 26 pound price we found a bargain, I don't think there is a better deal to be found for the money. Yes, there are a few rough edges here and there but I found them to be no more than what I have experienced for 100 pounds in other London hotels. So, the regular rates are quite reasonable too. If you book here expecting a five star hotel, then this is not the place for you. If you book expecting value for what you pay, and a clean quiet hotel, then you will be satisfied. I noted on check-in that one patron wanted a room change, which was speedily accomplished. I know there are negative reviews below, but I honestly have to say that we were very pleased with the hotel. We got more than we expected and the price was quite palatable.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austria", "Title": "\u201cnot bad at all!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4991076", "Content": "Having read some reviews on this page, I was a bit concerned of what exactly to expect from the hotel room and specially from the area, considered by some of my London acquaintances as \"sort of rough\".

They were so varying. Anyway I'd got it on an offer for \u00c2\u00a310 a night 27- 29th March. We arrived about 4pm and was greeted by a nice receptionist. I asked for a quiet room as several reports said the hotel was noisy at the front, so she said she'd see what she could do. She said she'd put us in a \"millenium\" room on the 2nd floor (Room 2001). It was sited at the side of the hotel and was really quiet. Loads of wardrobe and drawer space, not that we had much luggage. The heating worked and the shower etc. Yes it was strange - still no pillowcases! The pillow covers were clean but I still put a towel over it just in case. We used the restaurant on the site \u00c2\u00a36.50 for an all you could eat breakfast which we thought was good value. Yes you could get a breakfast cheaper across the road but by the time you added toast and coffee to it wasn't really cheap. Plus there was coissants yoghurt, fruit cereals etc juice as well.

Travelodge offers very attractive rates for hotels in central london from as little as \u00c2\u00a326 if you book on line early in advance. But you will have to pay for it somewhere. I stayed for 2 nights in January 2006 (not consecutively). The first night was ok although the room was old - given the price I paid, I couldn't complain more. But there was definitely an attitude probelm among the staff and most of them didn't give a damn about anything. While i was checking in, there was another couple panicking in the lobby as water was leaking in their bathroom - it was more like flooding to be precise. However, the staff \"in-charge\" was on the phone and so in the 10 minutes + that I took to check-in, nobody did anything and the water continued to flood. I got the impression that \"changing rooms\" was very common in that hotel and the staff were very used to it. They believe that as long as the room is changed, it will be fine - there's nothing to panic or to apologise about. I can confirm this when i stayed for the second night. I chose the same room as it was a quiet room. At about 1am, I saw a shadow in my room and then I realised it was a RAT!!!!!!!! It escaped to a hole in between the wall and the floor!!!!!! It was absolutely disguisting!!! I phoned up the reception to report this and requested to change room (bear in mind you cannot phone up the reception from the telephone in your room e.g press 0.... you can only call from you mobile if you have their reception number in advance). It was after 1am and in my pajamas and I was told to collect another key from the reception. No apologies whatsoever... I told the guy that I was in my pajamas and given I had to check out the new room, it would be better for him to bring up the key and show me that room first before I decided to accept it. I had to persuade him to do this. When this staff turned up, all he was interested in was whether it was a rat or a mouse. He didn't apologise. In addition to that, the old-aged radiator/ air cooler (at least 20 years old) doesn't work. The rat room had a new moveable radiator (something i use at home) but the other room which i moved to later hasn't got one- so after moving from the rat room, I was very cold for the rest of the night. I have stayed in various Travelodge for 4 times in between Oct 05 to Jan 06. Once I was offered some uncooked food (uncooked sausages) in Worcester Travelodge as the staff was in a rush so that he can watch the X-Factor final; woken up by cleaning staff before 9am in Covent Garden Travelodge although there was a sign outside my door clearly said \"Do not Disturb\". I thought those are minor but with the rat in Islington Travelodge, this left me with no option but to put this on-line to let everyone know. Do you know why for most Travelodges in their offical web site only the external pictures are shown? (i.e. no bedroom pictures?) It is because the condition is appauling. I am not saying it is not clean but they are like hotels that have not had any refurbishment for over 20 years. You would be lucky if you have a new radiator in your room as all the old ones do not work. I chose to stay in Travelodge for the obvious reason because it was cheap to purchase on-line in advance. But after 4 stays and with 3 ridiculous experiences, there is no way I would stay another night with Travelodge again. One final note is that I phoned up Travelodge head office trying to find out which Travelodge in London was new (i.e. at least refurbished over the last 2-3 years) so that there's less likely to get a hole in the wall... I was told that Islington was new!!!!!! Can you believe that!!!! Yes the reception and the canteen are but certainly not any of the rooms/ corridor....
