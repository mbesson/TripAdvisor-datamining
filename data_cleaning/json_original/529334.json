Our room was clean, but the first thing I noticed upon entering our \"non smoking room\", was an ash tray! The room looked like it was put together with the left overs from some construction job. The flooring didn't reach the walls on two sides, the wall finishes were varied and incomplete on any wall. There was no trash can and no plastic cups. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. The shower was within a foot of the bathroom door and blocked two-thirds of it. The toilet was so close to the shower that when you sat on it, your feet rested on the shower pan. Neither the toilet lid or seat stayed open so when you sat on the toilet the lid hit rested against your back. The restaurant was the latest thing in 1970s design. We asked for a wine list and was told they had red and white. We selected the red, which was very drinkable. We were served bread which was fresh and tasty. The pasta dishes were very good and so large we had no room for another course. Our waiter was a nice gentleman who was very concerned that we hadn't finished our pasta.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Villa Spada", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529334-Reviews-Villa_Spada-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$66 - $100*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Maria Elena Bettini 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">138</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529334", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/0/5/2/2/2250/2250.jpg"}}
