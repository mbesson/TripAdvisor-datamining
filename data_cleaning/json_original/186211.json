Stay only if this is significantly cheaper than any other place!\u201d", "Author": "Georgeamazing", "ReviewID": "UR89041570", "Content": "I stayed in this \"hotel\" for 2 weeks during my visit to Vancouver. Technically on business and needed to be close to VGH. Location: Approximately 30 minutes by taxi from the airport, this hotel is located adjacent to Vancouver General Hospital and is also adjacent to a quieter portion of West Broadway. Certainly, if you are a tourist that would like to see what Vancouver has to offer, this is not the location to do it at. Otherwise, if you are required to stay near VGH, this is one of the few strong points of the hotel. Hotel: The hotel itself on the outside appears more like an aged apartment building. The lobby is decent, and the I never encountered any problems with the staff although they can change their affect quickly with a minor complaint. The best part of the hotel was the restaurant downstairs. You do get free breakfast, but that is just a standard western breakfast that is average at best. The restaurant itself is an authentic Japanese restaurant run by Japanese people. The Japanese breakfast which you have to pay out of pocket for is excellent and the dinner menu is equally great with seasonal specials. Ate there at least half a dozen times and every meal was satisfactory. Not the best Vancouver has to offer but if you are too lazy to walk out to Broadway, this is a convenient and decent alternative. Amenities: I did not use many of the amenities available in this hotel. I will say though that there is a jacuzzi, gym and other stuff in the basement. Rooms are only cleaned weekly, so you are stuck retrieving your own towels from the basement and if you require a change of bedsheets, the onus is on you. There is free wireless internet in the lobby + 3 computers for general use. No internet in room period (either wireless or wired). The Room: I booked the cheapest room they had and it certainly showed. It was small. I have been in small rooms in Japan and abroad in Asia, but this is as small or even smaller than those rooms. The bed is actually pulled out from the couch and the sink to wash up is not in the washroom, but in the living area. Speaking of washroom, it stunk. Worst part of my stay was needing to shower or use the facilities and having to bear the smell which was reminiscent of aged public washrooms. There is also a TV in the room with basic cable. Small but operational. View was good from the balcony. In summary, this is not a place for tourists. If you are a tourist, avoid this hotel at all costs. There are cheaper B&B's that will be much more suitable. The only person I would recommend this hotel to is the individual who is on an immensely strict budget needing to be close to VGH AND requires a lengthy stay. If you satisfy all those requirements, then give this place a thought as it can save you a few bucks. Otherwise, Park Inn suites is just as convenient to VGH and for a minor price increase, you will avoid this place (which is always a bonus).", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "nanaimo", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience ever and this coming from a retired ramada assistant general manager\u201d", "Author": "jenswatt", "ReviewID": "UR87310983", "Content": "We were referred to this hotel by vancouver general hospital on november 12 2010 because our father was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering from an anurism.

Be ready for an extra $70 \"maintenance fee\" they mention just as they're about to give you your key. The facilities: The pool is outside and not heated. Great idea in a city like vancouver. It had a sheet of ice over it a few weeks back The hottub is very old and dingy, looks like it was built in the 70's. The \"health club\" is laughable. The equipment are antiques. The movie room is not a room you would want to watch a movie in. Basically, all the facilities or \"features\" they list on the site which sound great are all just so they can advertise them as features. None of them were ever being used and smelled like dingy rooms that were never used, probably because half of them are on the underground floor. The complimentary breakfasts are at the in-house restaurant, which is actually a Japanese restaurant. I love Japanese food, but they do not know how to cook western breakfasts. I fellow resident warned me not to eat the omlette. The pancakes tasted like water, and the ham and eggs had no flavor, with the ham actually being a spam like substance shaped like a piece of ham. I ate 2 meals and threw the rest of the coupons out. The worst part of my experience was the smell in the room, cleverly masked on the first day by air fresheners. After the first day the room starts to smell like an ashtray. I found this strange since they insited there was no smoking in the building. After the first night, smell the shirt you wore to bed. You will literally smell like an ashtray. Even worse, once you move out, everything you kept in the room that can hold an odour smells like old cigarettes, even clothes I put in cupboards and didn't wear. This is the honest truth, and I couldn't believe it. I usually take overly negative ratings with a grain of salt, they're often revenge posts. The internet has no shortage of smear campaigns. And this place isn't hell on earth, but it just plan sucks, all around. Every picture of the \"features\" you see on the site is a big disappointment in person, and none of the features that look like places to hang out (cupid gardens, movie room, outside dining, so called games rooms, etc), you will not want to spend any time in. And this entire building apart from the front desk area smells like ashtray. If I sound negative, I'm upset that they wouldn't refund my money after I tried to make an early exit. I pleaded that I felt duped into a room that smelled borderline the 1st day but horrible from then on. Yet I got the smug attitude of a management that is comfortable with their 80% occupancy rate, as they point to the fine print of the rental contract. I checked out before 2 weeks was up.

My small family stayed for 3 nights. It was booked one and a halfmonths in advance. At admission we were showed a family suite before checking in. It was unnecessary as no refund was possible if we reject the room. I have never seen such micro room before. The Suite comprised of a five and a half feet by six feet room ( having a double bed) and a adjacent four feet by six feet curved slice of a passage (converted to a room) having a sofa pullout . There were two balconies with beautiful view of the city but you cannot stand on balcony as each has a plastic table and two plastic chairs which fill up the space. A small child can perhaps squeeze in. The bathroom is a wonder. It is attached to the main room.`It had a semitransparent curtain and no doors'. I had to ask my child to go to the other room while I took the shower. You have to climb few steps to reach the bathtub (cum shower) and then jump down in a unusually deep bathtub. Heaven knows where they obtained such unusual bathtub from. You run a great risk of slipping and having and accident getting in and out of it. In fact, my child had a fall in bathtub. Fortunately it was not serious. It had a minifridge and a microwave but no plates, cups, spoons, tea or coffee bags and not even a water jug. Two slices of soaps (one each for bathroom and toilette) were given and no more, not even when requested, in three days. One toilette paper roll for three days. Nobody cleaned the room, made the beds during the entire stay. The pillows were flat, blankets thin and extra was not available on the evening we checked in. We had to carry these from maintenance to our room at 11th floor the next day as there was no room service to cut costs. The breakfast was limited to one toast cut into half plus cereal with half cup of milk (or omlette etc) and tea or coffee or fruit juice. You have to sign and countersign significant number of vouchers before breakfast was allowed. The front desk was unhelpful in even helping me with informations regarding travel in the city. The manager lady was clearly arrogant and hostile. Her answer to any complaint was that I am free to leave, of course without a refund, if I am not happy. The place is by no means cheap and to catch the nearest bus you have to walk half an hour. There are no shops nearby. Inspite of the shortcomings the place was almost full which made me curious.

They gave me extra towels when I asked. They also provided an extra set of room keys on request. (There were two of us staying and we each had separate daytime appointments.) Parking is an extra cost. I think it cheeky of any hotel, even a cheap one, to ask a parking fee. The elevator often had the scent of cigarettes and alcohol. The room is extremely small. I knocked my knees a few times getting in, out of, and around the bed even though I am quite small myself. The room is tidy but apparently not dusted on a regular basis and I wondered if it had been vacumed recently. Amenities are reasonable: Anyone serious about their daily workout will laugh at the weight room, but it serves the purpose. Sauna Two jacuzzis - one in the basement, one outside with the swimming pool. --- The change room in the basement is a nicer place to have your daily shower than the bathroom in your own room. The grounds are impeccably groomed and enjoyable on a nice day. The hotel restaurant is convenient but only open from 7:00 a.m. till 1:00 p.m. then open again later in the day for supper.

Reception staff has always been very polite to me. They have a strange checkin procedure, you may visit your room first, and thereafter you need to go back down to complete the check-in. As a guest I may expect a 'finished' room, and that all rooms are moreless equal. So why that effort? My room was expectedly small, but featured a bathroom with a tube, a balcony, a fully furnished kitchen and a wallbed (bed and couch in one). I don't know why people complain about the size, it's advertised as B&B, and they even state the size of the rooms. As a guest paying daily rates, you are entitled to breakfast vouchers, which can be redeemed at the 12th Avenue restaurant, which is located in the house. You may choose between different types of omlettes and one cup of coffee. It's not much, but it is good to cover the first hunger in the morning. Shaughnessy also offers a swimming pool, a jacuzzi, a nicely decorated garden and health club, which I didn't use. Location is basically good, but you have to walk at least three blocks to reach a bus stop (Broadway). Unfortunately there is no good supermarket available. Considering that the Shaughnessy is a B&B, it impressed me deeply. I only paid $65, but I had all the amenties mentioned, even a bath tube in my private bathroom.

Was fine for one night. After the cruise we stayed for 3 nights in a two room suite. We liked this one much better with the full size bed in a separate bedroom. The clientele seem to be a mix of senior citizens (who live there I think), students, and business travelers. Staff are friendly for the most part. The breakfast voucers are a nice addition.

Now, I've never been on a cruise ship, and if the cabins on one are anything like these rooms, I'd rather stay at home. They are like living in a shoebox... You have to go outside to change your mind. This isn't too bad if you're only staying for one or two nights, but if you're there for a long term, it's very cramped.
